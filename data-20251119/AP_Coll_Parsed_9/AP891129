a junior officer who ignored advice 
from a lowerranking navigator was to blame for the january 
grounding of the navy destroyer uss spruance on a reef off the 
bahamas a navy report says 
the florida timesunion of jacksonville published the report 
tuesday after obtaining it through a freedom of information act 
request the report contains the final results of the navys 
investigation 
the grounding of spruance was not an act of god was not due 
to equipment failure and was not the result of bad weather the 
report said 
it was caused by a combination of personnel errors and 
misjudgments which when compressed into a short period of time 
created a situation that put spruance aground 
though the mayportbased spruance was performing maneuvers with 
another ship and a submarine neither the ships commanding officer 
nor the executive officer was on the bridge when the 7800ton ship 
hit bottom the report said 
shortly after the accident the navy removed cmdr travis w 
parker jr as the ships skipper and reassigned the executive 
officer lt cmdr jm braeckel the junior officer in command 
when the grounding occurred lt wt hicks was discharged from 
the navy 
the spruances hull propellers sonar dome and forward mast 
were damaged in the accident and required 14 million in repairs 
the spruance was preparing to join an antisubmarine warfare 
exercise with the guidedmissile frigate boone and the 
nuclearpowered submarine atlanta off andros island in the bahamas 
last jan 15 
in the late evening hicks in command on the bridge ordered a 
series of course and speed changes to proceed with the rendezvous 
the destroyer was just over a halfmile off the reef when the 
maneuvers began 
when hicks considered a course change that would move the ship 
closer to the reef the report said he was advised against it by 
petty officer 1st class eg yeargin a quartermaster another 
officer lt jg js lindgren agreed 
hicks ordered the course change but agreed to slow the ship to 
just over 3 mph he then ignored four recommendations from yeargin 
and lindgren to change course to avoid the reef according to the 
report 
an officer and an enlisted man in the ships combat information 
center then recommended another course change to expedite the 
rendezvous but that would have led the ship directly through the 
shoal water the report said 
yeargin objected and demanded a course change but hicks ignored 
him again four minutes later the ship ran aground 
among other findings the report found that charts used aboard 
the spruance had not been properly updated and reefs were not 
highlighted as they should have been 
in addition the report faulted the spruances staff for failing 
to calculate the effects of rough seas on the ship at slow speeds

kieko hara has attended a cram school for 
months in a desperate effort to be ready for entrance exams shes 
5 and her parents hope kieko will make it into a topranked 
private elementary school 
she attends cramming sessions twice a week after kindergarten 
and on weekends 
some days kieko makes rice balls or crafts or is drilled in 
the japanese alphabet once a week she takes a practice test like 
those used by private schools to choose the few applicants they 
accept 
we wish she didnt have to go to cram school but if she gets 
into a good private system now then shell be able to enter 
the schools junior high automatically said yuko her mother 
japanese public education is praised for egalitarianism and the 
high scores of students on achievement tests but as public schools 
have become more equal parents have sought an edge elsewhere 
children are being sent at everyounger ages to cram schools 
called jukus or are going to private rather than public schools in 
hopes of gaining ground in the merciless collegeentrance 
competition 
the education ministry says 71 percent of elementary and junior 
high students attend jukus or have special outside lessons in 
effect creating an entire second school system it is a booming 
business estimated to be worth about 1 trillion yen or 7 billion 
a year 
some japanese contend the increasing role of private spending in 
education threatens the equality of opportunity created by the 
public school system others feel public schools have concentrated 
on educating the mass of students neglecting the bright and 
creative 
getting into the best schools frequently costs a staggering 
amount of money as well as work 
kiekos parents pay about 65000 yen 460 a month for her juku 
classes in addition to fees for her private kindergarten some 
classmates began attending a juku at age 3 to prepare for the 
kindergarten entrance exam and now have daily cram sessions before 
kindergarten and again in the afternoon 
such devotion to schooling has a long history in japan and some 
other asian nations but the intense competition is largely a 
postwar development that grew with economic prosperity 
japan spends less on public education than the united states 
both in total amount and percentage of gross national product 
in the last fiscal year the government allocated 16 trillion 
yen 112 billion to public education compared with 353 billion 
this year in the united states 
an education minstry study in 1987 said 42 percent of japans 
gnp went to public education compared with 48 percent in the 
united states 44 percent in britain and 42 percent in west 
germany 
spending on education in the united states varies greatly by 
school district and region but japan has followed a policy of 
equal distribution of resources it also does not track 
students separating them according to ability 
in the united states the federal government provides about 6 
percent of the public money for kindergarten through high school 
japans central government pays 43 percent much of it in subsidies 
to local districts that reduce regional disparities to less than 20 
percent according to government figures 
the education ministry approves textbooks and curricula so all 
students study essentially the same material at the same time 
in high school japanese students cram for college entrance 
exams that determine not only what schools they will attend but 
their chances for a good job afterward 
companies with the most prestige usually hire graduates of only 
the top universities 
college entrance exams have become more difficult as competition 
has intensified and frequently include material not covered in the 
public school curriculum according to education ministry studies 
with craming for exams now extending down to kindergarten by 
junior high school many students feel their life has already been 
ordained said naomi kikuchi who has two children in school 
in the past a leading public high school was considered the 
best preparation for college entrance that changed as the high 
schools became more equal 
many parents and students now see jukus with their 
singleminded emphasis on preparing for exams as more helpful than 
public schools in gaining admission to good universities 
about 70 percent of parents in a recent survey said they 
disapproved of jukus but most said they enrolled their children as 
a necessary evil 
other families try to get their children into top private 
kindergartens or elementary schools especially those of respected 
private universities that automatically admit graduates of their 
own lower schools 
the first year of aoyama universitys kindergarten one of the 
most soughtafter schools costs about 14 million yen 9500 
more than the 980000yen 6800 for the first year of university 
a survey by a major bank in 1987 found that education expenses 
account for 134 percent of aftertax earnings for an average 
japanese family in a metropolitan area 
that did not include salary forgone by the kyoiku mama 
mothers who devote themselves to their childrens education until 
the youngsters enter elementary school and for periods before 
entrance exams 
for people without money and mothers who have to work its 
hard to get children into a good school mrs kikuchi said

andrew young doesnt play up the milestone 
victories of two black candidates in new york city and virginia 
but he does share one strategy in his quest to become governor of 
georgia he rarely mentions race 
theres little doubt race will be a factor in many voters minds 
next summer as they size up young who is finishing eight years as 
atlantas mayor some pundits already have predicted he will fail 
in his bid to become the states first black governor 
but others are talking about momentum from the successful 
campaigns of virginia govelect l douglas wilder and new york 
mayorelect david dinkins 
young isnt jumping on that bandwagon 
i think it feels good to be a respectable candidate and 
thats all i think i am at this point he said 
young says he doesnt have much in common with wilder and 
dinkins other than the fact that we all went to the same college 
howard university and we all happen to have the same skin color 
but lately he has done at least one thing both dinkins and 
wilder did dismiss race as a factor 
his campaign chairman is griffin bell a former us attorney 
general and federal judge who is white and conservative bell was 
us attorney general in jimmy carters administration young was 
ambassador to the united nations 
young also is aggressively pursuing the white vote in mostly 
rural and conservative south georgia pushing his record for 
business development and economic expansion his campaign manager 
is a white former smalltown south georgia mayor hobby stripling 
of vienna 
i would suspect that the young organization has been studying 
carefully the wilder campaign said merle black a political 
science professor at emory university 
but unlike wilder young has stuck to his bent for the offbeat 
his latest escapade came last week when he ate dinner in a rustic 
juke joint where two racially offensive songs are featured on the 
jukebox 
ill go anywhere and talk to anybody young said the 
world is made up of different people and the only way were going 
to survive is to learn to coexist and respect one another 
while there he played down race in an obviously racially 
charged situation and took the opportunity to give the restaurants 
owner a ray charles record for the jukebox 
political watchers say young is taking pains to put himself 
forth as a racially palatable black candidate 
the fact that douglas wilder now has won shows it can be done 
to that extent it helps andrew young be seen as a more credible 
and realistic candidate black said it would have been a 
setback for youngs campaign if wilder had lost 
wilder said his campaign was successful because it appealed to 
mainstream values although his candidacy was closely watched by 
black leaders wilder deliberately kept liberal twotime 
presidential candidate jesse jackson at arms length and did not 
invite jackson to campaign for him 
young also will not include jackson in his campaign stripling 
said tuesday 
we dont have any plans to ask mr jackson for any help he 
said our campaign is a georgiabased campaign and we will 
handle it from within the state 
young was booed loudly by jackson supporters at the 1984 
democratic national convention in san francisco the jackson 
forces frustrated over their failure to win concessions from the 
walter mondale camp yelled at young when he rose to speak on 
behalf of a mondale position 
young was stunned his wife cried and a press aide collapsed 
still young and jackson have remained cordial 
atlanta political pollster claibourne darden predicts youngs 
campaign will be troubled by race whether he likes it or not 
young could come in first in the first round of the democratic 
primary on the strength of his name recognition and the black vote 
24 percent of georgias votingage population is black darden 
said but young wouldnt get the 50 percent he would need to win 
darden said 
he will be in the runoff regardless darden said but we 
are still at a place where a tremendous number of white people in 
georgia are not willing to vote for a black candidate 
its not like virginia youre in the deep south here and the 
black population is significantly larger thats unfortunately a 
pretty good correlation for prejudice the larger the minority 
group the more prejudice there is 
young however discounts that 
i always felt that white folk in georgia are way ahead of 
white folk in new york or virginia already he said i used to 
kid dave dinkins that if he could get 30 percent of the white vote 
in new york i know i can get 45 or 50 in georgia 
in the democratic primary young faces lt gov zell miller two 
powerful state legislators sen roy barnes and rep bubba 
mcdonald and a wildcard entry former gov lester maddox 
the frontrunner for the republican nomination is state rep

an fbi agent and a deputy prosecutor in los 
angeles were too late for the gold but they get the glory they 
have solved the mystery of the 500000 golden horse treasure 
contest 
alone among the tens of thousands who sought the buried 
treasure they deduced that the golden horse was buried in 
tennessee pass 10400 feet above sea level along the continental 
divide in colorado 
nick boone and anthony castaneda who spent more than five years 
working separately on the puzzle told the associated press on 
tuesday they had solved the riddle and the people who ran the 
contest dont disagree 
we have no comment about the site but we will acknowledge and 
confirm that hes given us totally convincing proof that he found 
the exact location thomas conlon president of dl blair said 
after speaking to boone blair the national sales promotion 
company that oversaw the contest has refused to divulge the 
solution 
boone 45 an fbi agent for 18 years was the fbis case agent 
for planning and security at the 1984 olympic games 
i know what it is to have a letdown after a long haul boone 
said tom and i are looking to see if we can find another good 
contest 
castaneda 44 a prosecutor for 16 years said he was not drawn 
to working puzzles before the golden horse challenge unless you 
count solving murders 
the puzzle was offered to the public in 1984 as a story titled 
treasure in search of the golden horse which was released as 
a book videotape and laser disc the story contained arcane and 
complex clues to the puzzle 
contestants had until midnight of may 26 to find a statuette of 
a horse buried somewhere in the united states the horse was made 
of 22 pounds of pure gold and contained a key to a safe deposit 
box containing a 20year annuity for 25000 a year 
the deadline passed with no claimant as stipulated by the 
rules the treasure was dug up and turned over to a charity big 
brothers and big sisters of america but the site was not revealed 
many frustrated treasure hunters who spent years money and 
sweat on the puzzle clamored for the solution some maintained the 
contest was a fraud and that no trove was ever buried 
conlon big brothers and the authors of the story bound by the 
contest rules kept mum 
i would love to have seen them retrieve this seven months ago 
not only for their benefit but ours so we would not have had to 
endure six months of slander conlon said 
the partners wont reveal yet the stepbystep path that led 
them to tennessee pass that will come in an article they are 
preparing for publication in the march issue of treasure magazine 
you really cant work from the site backward boone said 
because theres nothing that points to colorado and tennessee 
pass you have to solve the ciphers to find it 
boone said the puzzle jelled on nov 1 and he and castaneda flew 
to the pass two days later to dig up whatever evidence of the stash 
remained 
amid snow cold and gathering darkness they missed the spot by 
18 inches boone said 
returning to los angeles the collaborators realized that they 
should have had a polaroid camera with them to photograph the site 
and exactly align a landmark with a map from the book on which the 
spot was marked with an x 
they returned on nov 18 and this time found proof positive that 
they were right they dug up a vial containing a parchment that 
began dear seeker congratulations your travails are over 
boone said 
they also found the remains of the crate that had contained the 
horse and a coat that the crate had been wrapped in said conlon 
then following instructions on the parchment boone telephoned 
conlon and read him a coded message 16569 inf the code 
referred to the two numerical designators of conlons old army 
unit the fighting 69th infantry regiment

the cost of new weapons and decreasing defense 
budgets are forcing more countries including some nato members to 
upgrade their armored vehicles rather than buy new ones a new 
janes yearbook said today 
nato countries are concentrating their upgrading on improving 
fire control systems and providing an enhanced night vision 
capability said the authors of the 19891990 edition of janes 
armored fighting vehicle systems 
few countries are at present installing new armament which is 
required to penetrate the latest soviet mbts main battle tanks or 
to install more armor to increase their battlefield 
survivability wrote christopher foss and tony cullen in the 
authoritative yearbook 
they said the installation of a larger caliber gun and 
additional armor would in most cases overload the vehicles 
suspension and reduce the powertoweight ratio 
natos next tank gun is likely to have a caliber of 140mm and be 
fed by an automatic loader that will enable the crew to be reduced 
to three they said 
the new gun could be mounted externally with the crew seated 
inside the hull the authors said this provides a number of 
advantages including a significant weight saving as the turret on 
current main battle tanks can weight 20 tons 
the weight saved could be used to make the vehicle more 
compact or to increase protection levels especially against top 
attack weapons the authors said 
in addition it would present an enemy with a much smaller 
target 
the authors said much development work is taking place on 
conventional tank guns and ammunition but there is little doubt 
that in the longer term the future is in other types of weapon 
systems for the main armament 
liquid propellant is the most likely route for artillery they 
said for the main battle tank the electromagnetic or 
electrothermal gun is showing much promise 
the united states is the leader in both areas they said in the 
latter because of a spinoff from the star wars program formally 
known as the strategic defense initiative

by encouraging eastern european allies who punched 
holes in the berlin wall and sacked aging leaders the soviet union 
is declaring the cold war over and trying to ensure security in the 
new world to follow 
president mikhail s gorbachev and his top advisers believe the 
whole world including postwar europe has been changed forever by 
an explosion of technology mastered by the other side 
looking grimly at the backwardness of his own country and his 
neighbors the breathtaking changes that have gripped eastern 
europe this fall nevertheless offer gorbachev two opportunities 
to renew and salvage at least part of a socialist system in 
which he sincerely believes before stagnation and dissatisfaction 
blow the lid off 
to achieve economic reform by redirecting his own economy away 
from the military and drawing the east into the wests 
technological revolution military security might be assured 
through economic interdependence that makes confrontation 
unprofitable 
when he echoes the call of alexander dubcek 21 years ago for 
socialism with a human face czechoslovakias reform ground 
under the treads of warsaw pact tanks gorbachev seems to aim at 
keeping half a loaf rather than risking it all later in 
unpredictable fury 
the move has won gorbachev respect in the west and support in 
eastern europe polands noncommunist government has pledged 
support to the warsaw pact and continued friendship with the soviet 
union 
while acknowledging the wests technological superiority and 
economic might gorbachev is far from declaring surrender in the 
cold war he and his advisers say they have a clearer idea of how 
to use western muscle to build a new world 
politically the world has entered a new phase it is moving 
out of the cold war into a period of peace foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze told the us foreign policy association in 
october 
today we need a consensus an international approach to global 
problems not because it is a moral imperative but for objective 
reasons because the world is a single and interdependent whole 
he said 
in a world of buyers and sellers crisscrossed with satellite 
communications and computer technology gorbachev sees his land 
that has been sealed off and content with the abacus as the 
ultimate loser 
now we have to make up for lost time and this requires a more 
rapid pace of change he said last week who asked about reforms 
in eastern europe 
it also requires peace gorbachev is cutting 500000 men out of 
the armed forces about half of them from eastern europe some 
missiles are being taken out of eastern europe the defense budget 
was cut 83 percent this year and defense factories are being 
retooled to make consumer goods 
negotiations continue on sharp cuts in strategic nuclear 
weapons conventional forces in europe and chemical weapons 
to put it in a nutshell we need a normal external environment 
for our domestic work gorbachev told former west german 
chancellor willy brandt in october 
the soviet union and the czarist empire before it was fearful of 
a powerful germany in the heart of europe but the betting now 
appears to be that if germany is absorbed in being eastern europes 
rich uncle it will have little incentive to rock the boat the 
area also may become an area of cooperation and understanding 
between the superpowers the government news agency novosti said 
marshal sergei f akhromeyev the former military chief of staff 
and a gorbachev adviser indicated in an article in the communist 
party daily pravda that the army may consider a land buffer is less 
important now 
what worries the soviet military is being surrounded by us 
navy firepower akhromeyev said the united states has 2 times 
more large surface ships 15 attack aircraft carriers to none for 
the soviets 2 times more maritime aircraft and 19 times more 
marines he said 
the usa most likely intends to continue using these 
forces to put pressure on us and threaten the soviet union he 
said 
if gorbachev and his advisers believe they have a clear idea of 
the future they are concerned that shortterm instability in 
eastern europe could ruin it 
any deep changes especially those in key regions of the 
world are accompanied by instability and difficulties this is 
only natural the most dangerous thing at such moments is that 
someone may be tempted to use them for their own selfish 
interests he said on nov 21 
the berlin wall however many holes it has must remain standing 
for the time being the soviets say too much is changing in europe 
for the region to cope simultaneously with the elimination of the 
political structure that kept the peace however tense for more 
than 40 years 
gorbachevs fear of eastern europe spinning entirely out of 
control may be why he has so firmly supported reform in poland 
hungary east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia gorbachev was 
in china earlier this year just before authorities cracked down on 
prodemocracy demonstrators and killed hundreds of them 
an eastern europe with no hope of catching up or enjoying the 
fruits of the wests technological revolution could be more likely 
to explode some reports in east germany say orders to shoot at 
protesters had been given before erich honecker was forced out by 
egon krenz 
the alternative to reform tighter borders and more stagnation 
would mean abject defeat in the cold war

american soldiers 
who watch the east german frontier dont relax their guard now that 
the barriers are down but some have been deeply moved by the 
experience 
at some points north and south of here there were so many 
people coming across it was like they were getting out of jail it 
choked me up said sgt michael harris 26 of battle creek mich 
sgt 1st class joe osterfeld of dayton ohio said the 
greatest thing in the world is to be a part of it i was standing 
there when they tore a piece of this fence out a few miles away 
from here 
harris and osterfeld are stationed with the 11th armored cavalry

of frankfurt and a few feet from what used to be a heavily 
fortified border 
us soldiers say they have not relaxed because increased 
soviet helicopter patrols near the frontier show theyre still 
there but seeing the free flow of people across the line has 
been affecting 
you didnt have to be at the border you could go downtown and 
see those people buying things we take for granted like fruit and 
coffee said sgt brad hanson 23 of atlanta 
the 11th helps keep watch and gather intelligence through 
surveillance of sovietled warsaw pact troops on the east german 
side officials say more than 380000 soviet soldiers are based in 
east germany 
if an attack occurred the 5000man regiment would try to delay 
it long enough for other nato forces to move up included in the 
units sector is the the fulda gap a traditional wartime invasion 
route through central germany 
for those who watch the 196mile stretch of border the dramatic 
relaxation of travel restrictions on the east germans has not 
altered the routine very much 
osterfeld 31 led a motorized patrol of men in green camouflage 
fatigues along the rusty 10foottall steel mesh fences that mark 
the border near opalpha 
the soldiers some armed with 45caliber pistols others with 
m16 rifles sometimes patrol on foot stopping to peer through 
binoculars into east germany and reporting in by radio 
since nov 9 east germany has opened 14 new crossings along the 
stretch of border guarded by 11th armored cavalry soldiers there 
used to be only two 
none of the crossings are visible from opalpha and the chilly 
landscape of hills and valleys 15 miles northeast of fulda is 
unchanged from before the dramatic changes in east germany 
as american soldiers looked across the border with binoculars 
east german guards could be seen in a watchtower 200 yards away 
peering through their own binoculars at the gis 
command sgt maj jake fryer the outfits ranking 
noncommissioned officer said more than 100000 wellequipped 
soviet troops are stationed directly across from the americans in 
central east germany 
the soviets have not shown a willingness to move back thats 
why were still here and ready to react said fryer 38 of 
coburn pa 
the east germans who are coming here are welcome he said 
but we are still doing our job and our surveillance 
fryer said the soviets appeared to have increased their air 
patrols along the border using mi24 attack helicopters for 
missions formerly flown primarily by east germans in polishmade 
resupply and observation choppers 
we see about one a day depending on weather and flying 
conditions he said i think its their way of showing that 
theyre still there and ready too 
over coffee in opalphas small dining hall sgt marlon 
thornston 24 of niagara falls ny said some rookies question 
why they still patrol a frontier millions of east germans crossing 
freely 
we now have to explain to our young guys who have met some of 
these nice east german people why were still here he said 
the only thing i dont feel good about is that all of them even 
the bad ones looking for intelligence also now have more free 
access 
staff sgt stephen torak 31 of elkhart ind said we have 
to stay here just in case the soviets and their allies havent 
put all their cards on the table 
now and then an east german guard will wave at the americans 
across the border hanson said 
do they wave back no he said theyre still there armed 
just like we are our guys ignore it and carry out their jobs like 
professionals

the seven men were not priests 
or human rights campaigners so their deaths have gone largely 
unnoticed 
but according to relatives and neighbors including a young man 
who barely escaped the slaughter six of them were lined up against 
a peachcolored masonry wall and shot to death on nov 18 a 
seventh youth who happened upon the killings by chance also was 
slain 
the relatives neighbors and the young escapee all saw 
government soldiers a block away from the killing site in the poor 
suburb of cuscatancingo minutes before the seven were slain the 
young man said he heard the fatal gunshots while hiding from the 
soldiers 
the dead were identified as walter and raul zetino oscar lopez 
jose crespin jorge campos raul castro and emanuel medrano 
the killings occurred two days after the slaying of six jesuits 
their cook and her daughter at central american university 
the central american university killings carried out by men who 
a survivor said wore military uniforms stunned el salvador and 
caused an international outcry there was no international outcry 
for the seven slain in cuscatancingo 
spokesmen for the salvadoran armed forces press office were 
unavailable for comment on the cuscatancingo killings 
raul zetino was found with his social security card in his 
hand he was still trying to identify himself when they shot him 
said a neighbor standing in front of the bloodspattered 
bulletriddled wall where the six bodies were found the morning of 
nov 19 in cuscatancingo at the end of the dusty partially cobbled 
pasaje el gringo gringo alley 
medrano 14 was the only victim not from the neighborhood his 
mother alicia said he was there trying to buy bread medrano 
appears to have had the bad luck to stumble on the killings as they 
were being carried out or just afterward his body was found 10 
yards away 
because his family did not have the 35 for a proper burial he 
is the only one still buried at the end of the alley 
relatives and neighbors had buried the seven in a common grave 
at the end of the alley on nov 19 when much of the capital was 
still convulsed by the biggest guerrilla offensive of the 
10yearold civil war 
the six local men were exhumed with approval of justice of the 
peace jesus cordoba on nov 23 and taken to cemeteries 
they were not guerrillas said the coach of the soccer team 
on which three of the slain men played they had jobs families 
everybody around here knew them a guerrilla doesnt have time to 
work take care of his family and play soccer 
three of the six were day laborers one worked at a glass 
factory and another at a brewery lopez a 23yearold illegal 
immigrant waiter in los angeles had arrived only two weeks earlier 
to visit friends from his neighborhood 
cuscatancingo like other working class districts along the 
capitals northern fringe was the scene of combat in the nov 11 
offensives first days pasaje el gringo had come through 
relatively unscathed although fighting was more intense a few 
blocks away air force strafing and rocketing had come too close 
for comfort 
we decided to evacuate said crespins sister rosa maria 
but one always worries about leaving the house completely 
abandoned so the guys decided to stay to keep an eye on things 
even though we begged them to come too 
the muchachos guerrillas had come through a few days before 
but we had no problem with them and they didnt stop to stay 
here said a neighbor 
we were just sitting around talking when someone threw a 
rock at a dog in the street in front of us and made it bark and 
run said the young man who escaped 
for days he had refused to meet with any journalist and was only 
persuaded to tell his story after the strictest assurances 
delivered through relatives that he would not be identified 
here out of fear one abstains from saying important 
things said a relative sooner or later they catch up to 
you 
the soldiers saw oscar and yelled for him to come out into the 
street said the young man who escaped the cuscatancingo 
killings he went out with his hands in the air saying were 
civilians jorge and i were sitting with our backs to the wall and 
they hadnt seen us i felt something bad was going to happen and 
said to him lets get out of here 
he said we havent done anything so why should we run and 
stood up to take out his identification the soldier in charge of 
the patrol swore at oscar out in the street you sob what the 
hell are you doing here 
i stayed crouched down and took off along the wall and around 
the corner he said 
i ran a few blocks and hid about 10 minutes later there was a 
long burst from an m16 then the coups de grace one by one 
cordoba said the only thing i can attest to is that the 
bodies of those seven were found at that place on that date that 
six were exhumed on nov 23 and that they all died of bullet 
wounds 
who killed them i dont know he said 
cordoba said he will send the supreme court his monthly report 
of all official business and the case will be pursued if an 
offended party such as a relative files a complaint or if the 
attorney generals office decides it merits pursuit even in the 
absence of a complaint 
the attorney generals office would then make a preliminary 
investigation which probably would include another exhumation and 
autopsies and assign the case to a criminal court judge 
meanwhile josefina crespin joses mother continues to live in 
the green house next to her sons the one whose facade served as 
the firing squad wall 
threeyearold carolina one of joses two daughters played in 
the sand in front of the house 
she doesnt even know what happened the grandmother said 
she just keeps asking wheres papi

sam and julie morter thought their family 
was complete after having three sons so sam had a vasectomy 
then came the morters daughters triplets 
we just tell everybody we hoped and prayed for a little girl 
and we must have prayed too hard because now we have three said 
morter a technical sergeant stationed at wrightpatterson air 
force base 
the morters always wanted a girl 
their firstborn was a boy jeffy then came johnny then jimmy 
the morters decided three was enough and in july 1987 while he 
was stationed in korea the vasectomy was performed 
morter 29 said a followup test performed by an air force 
surgeon confirmed that the vasectomy was successful 
then came samantha stephanie and sarah who celebrated their 
first birthday nov 19 
last year before prescribing birth control pills as treatment 
for an ovarian cyst ms morters doctor gave her a routine 
pregnancy test even though mrs morter insisted she couldnt 
possibly be expecting 
they said not only are you pregnant youre very pregnant 
morter said we didnt know what that meant 
we found out though his wife said 
after the pregnancy was confirmed morter had his vasectomy 
reexamined a test showed that his sperm count was 30 percent of 
normal instead of zero 
doctors arent sure why the vasectomy failed morter said 
they said theyd have to go back in and look he said he 
told them not to bother 
after the triplets arrived mrs morter 28 had her fallopian 
tubes tied dr jan bernie a dayton urologist said vasectomy 
failure is not very common at all ive done them for 20 years 
and maybe one or two in all that time has failed its a very 
effective method of birth control 
in morters case one of the tubes that carry the sperm from the 
testicles probably grew back together bernie said

for the second night in a row coast guard 
searchers spotted a flare tuesday in their hunt for five lobsterman 
who disappeared a week ago off the massachusetts coast 
the sighting about 250 miles south of nantucket is in a remote 
area where coast guard rescuers believe a life raft might have 
drifted 
the flares are coming from somewhere said lt paul wolf of 
the coast guard office in boston there are no other boats out 
there except the coast guard 
were going to search as long as theres a reasonable 
possibility that someone is alive and needs help said coast 
guard petty officer elizabeth brannan 
the 72foot heidi marie out of stonington conn was reported 
missing by its owner on nov 22 the boats last transmission was 
the previous day the same day officials received a distress signal 
the jet that spotted the flare tuesday night continued 
searching two coast guard cutters were also sent to the scene 
a red flare had been spotted in the area monday night both 
orange and red flares are used to signal an emergency wolf said 
flare lights last about two minutes 
the jet that spotted the second emergency flare was due to 
return to land for refueling at about 10 pm wolf said but a 
second aircraft was sent to the area to take its place 
were so far off shore that its difficult wolf said 
on friday rescuers turned up a floating radio beacon and 
fishing markers bearing the heidi maries name the fishing boat 
was equipped with a life raft big enough for the entire crew 
on tuesday three aircraft and two cutters searched an 
8000squaremile area some of which had been covered before 
brannan said the search concentrated around the area where a red 
flare was seen monday night coast guard officials said the person 
who lit the flare could have been anywhere from 6 to 30 miles from 
where it was spotted 
where the flare was seen is where our trajectory was 
predicting the raft would be brannan said 
the manufacturer of the boats life raft told coast guard 
officials that the craft contained three orange smoke flares three 
red distress flares plus an unspecified number of parachute 
flares such as the one seen monday 
brannan said she could not speculate about whether the crew 
members could survive a week at sea in the life raft 
it depends were there provisions were they wearing survival 
suits she said the lobster boat carried survival suits for 
seven people 
seas last tuesday were reported to be 26 feet high with wind 
gusts to 45 knots in the area where the heidi marie was lobstering 
but fishermen in stonington said it was not unusual for a boat 
to stay out in rough seas 
that boat has weathered worse weather said fisherman skip

japanese and americans trust each other less and 
less and an increasing number are pessimistic about the 
relationship between their countries according to a new poll 
japanese still trust the united states more than any other 
country but japan ranks only no 11 among countries americans 
trust according to the poll published tuesday by japans largest 
daily newspaper 
according to the survey former presidents kennedy and reagan 
have left strong impressions on many japanese but nearly eight in 
10 americans cannot name a single japanese individual who has stuck 
in their minds 
the poll was conducted by the paper yomiuri shimbun and the 
american gallup polling organization the yomiuri said 3000 
japanese were surveyed in late september and 1025 americans in 
midoctober a margin for error was not given 
with trade tensions between the two countries on the rise more 
americans than ever before in annual polls 11year history called 
relations between the united states and japan bad 
among americans 93 percent said relations were bad compared 
to 60 percent last year among japanese traditionally more 
pessimistic on the issue 184 percent said relations were bad 
slightly up from 175 percent in 1988 
many americans still feel relations are good or very 
good 456 percent compared to 38 percent of japanese among 
the japanese polled just 31 percent believed relations will 
improve compared to 52 percent of americans 
only 151 percent of americans named japan among the five 
countries they most trusted up slightly from last year but far 
below the 234 percent in 1984 nearly 54 percent of japanese said 
they trusted the united states down from last year and lower than 
the 574 percent in 1984 
americans in the poll expressed the most trust for canada 
britain australia and switzerland japanese gave top 
trustworthiness rankings to the united states britain australia 
and france 
asked if their government should protect domestic industries by 
restricting imports 66 percent of americans said yes compared to 
43 percent of japanese 
on agriculture 64 percent of americans said their government 
should restrict imports compared to 60 percent of japanese both 
figures were up from last year 
among the japanese polled 82 percent said they would choose a 
domestically made product over an import compared to 73 percent of 
the americans 
asked to name a japanese person who had made an impression on 
them most of the americans came up blank 
the late emperor hirohito was the most prominent japanese in 
american minds although he was named by just 66 percent of those 
polled 
next was sony corp chairman akio morita considered an 
unusually highprofile figure in japanese business circles he 
still left an impression on only 16 percent of the americans 
polled 
by contrast 338 percent of japanese said john f kennedy made 
an impression on them followed by 233 percent for reagan and 170 
percent for gen douglas macarthur who was supreme commander of 
us forces occupying japan after world war ii 
americans saw their own leaders somewhat as the japanese did 
ranking kennedy and reagan highest followed by martin luther king 
jr 
president bush ranked eighth most impressive to americans and

president bush sought to reassure european 
allies tuesday about his summit with soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev promising im not going to surprise them with any 
agreement to cut nuclear weapons or reduce us troops overseas 
bush said he and gorbachev may discuss possible military 
cutbacks in a general way when they meet off the coast of malta 
on saturday and sunday 
but he added in writing i have made clear to mr gorbachev 
in my handwriting so he knows it comes from me not the 
bureaucracy that this is not a summit for arms control 
agreement 
meanwhile budget constraints at home are forcing cuts in the 
us armed services whatever troop withdrawals are negotiated 
with the warsaw pact as of nov 1 there were 213 million men and 
women in the armed services 
the services have drafted plans for a reduction of 275000 with 
about 135000 to be trimmed from the army 100000 from the air 
force and 40000 from the navy and marines defense sources told 
the associated press 
defense secretary richard b cheney will make a decision on the 
service chiefs proposal when he returns thursday from a nato 
meeting in brussels belgium and reports to president bush 
the sources declining to be identified said richard darman 
the director of the presidential office of management and budget 
was pushing for even deeper cuts in the armed forces 
pentagon officials recommended cutting 23000 jobs involved in 
weapons procurement for the army and air force according to a 
report in wednesdays editions of the washington post a final 
decision has not been made but members of congress have complained 
that the cuts are aimed mainly at workers and fieldlevel positions 
while not reducing the ranks of management 
bush said it was very important for the allies to know im not 
going to go off and prematurely jump out there and try to 
grandstand by committing them to something thats not the way you 
keep an alliance strong 
after the twoday summit bush will fly to brussels on dec 4 to 
brief nato leaders on the discussions 
the allies were aghast to learn in 1987 that thenpresident 
reagan and gorbachev had come close to a deal at a summit in 
reykjavik to abolish all nuclear weapons in spite of the fact that 
nato regards some of those arms as vital to deter soviet attack 
now with the collapse of hardline communist regimes in eastern 
europe and massive budget deficits in the united states the bush 
administration is considering major cutbacks in troops and weapons 
gorbachev is facing similar pressures at home 
however bush said there are no arms control proposals for 
the summit 
so the surprise will be if youre looking for a surprise 
there wont be a surprise that may come as a surprise he said 
he said there had been frantic speculation and hyped 
speculation that the superpowers would reach a deal on arms or 
troops 
now if we want to talk in a general way with the soviet 
leaders about our aspirations for how a defense system will look 10 
years from now of course well do that we want to do that 
bush said 
in particular bush said he would like to talk with the soviets 
about curtailing their defense spending 
but thats not what im referring to when i talk about 
euphoric expectations of some deal bush said there isnt 
going to be such a deal it takes two to make a deal 
separately the state department said the united states has 
little interest in a possible soviet proposal to restrict naval 
power 
the soviet union a land power would be less constrained by 
such proposals said state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler we are not aware of naval arms control measures that 
enhance stability 
despite criticism at home that he has reacted too cautiously to 
changes sweeping eastern europe bush said his approach was solidly 
supported by nato leaders 
saying he had consulted with each nato chief bush said i 
dont want to sound selfcentered here but almost every one of 
those leaders told me we think the united states is handling this 
properly we appreciate the way youre handling these changes the 
prudent approach you are taking 
moreover bush said it should be the people of eastern europe 
who lead the way toward change it doesnt come from somebody 
halfway across the world dictating how fast change should be or 
what change should encompass 
bush also promised that he would press gorbachev at the summit 
over the behavior of moscows central american allies cuba and 
nicaragua which the united states accuses of shipping sovietmade 
weapons to leftist insurgents 
the president said he was asked in a telephone call from costa 
rican president oscar arias to ask gorbachev to stop feeding 
fidel castro arias has spearheaded a drive for a regional peace 
accord in central america 
bush said the soviets have not cut off arms deliveries to cuba 
and as mr arias said there is one person most responsible 
for support of the fmln leftist rebels to deny democracy to 
central america deny democracy to el salvador and that is fidel 
castro bush said he said arias mentioned nicaraguan president 
daniel ortega in the same connection

it was to be a casual feet up meeting with 
neither expectations nor an agenda but since this weekends 
superpower summit was first announced the white house is gradually 
defining items it expects to broach at malta 
the administration is seeking to shape an agenda that seems 
guaranteed to keep the feet of both soviet and us leaders firmly 
planted even as president bush insists his shipboard summit with 
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev will yield no deals and no 
surprises 
so the surprise will be if youre looking for a surprise 
there wont be a surprise that may come as a surprise bush told 
reporters tuesday 
presidential press secretary marlin fitzwater recently observed 
that the soviets tend to overplay advance expectations for summits 
americans tend to minimize them and that the truth lies somewhere 
in between 
so a week after bush told a providence ri audience the 
summit would be historic the president complained to reporters 
during an oval office picturetaking session tuesday about all 
kind of hyped speculation 
bush insisted he would cut no deals with gorbachev on arms 
control nor do anything else that would give allies pause and he 
said the meeting remains without a fixed agenda 
still in an effort not to be caught offguard as the united 
states was at the 1987 reagangorbachev summit at reykjavik the 
bush administration has been compiling a list of subjects that bush 
is prepared to discuss 
it also has suggested ground rules on how some of the subjects 
will be handled 
that looks an awful lot like an agenda 
for one thing the president has made clear he will confront 
gorbachev on the issue of continued soviet bloc arms shipments to 
rebels in el salvador by way of nicaragua and fidel castros cuba 
the administration has said the continued shipments threaten 
improved ussoviet relations in other areas 
im not the sort of man that will go there and not raise it 
bush said 
bush also has vowed to seek his gorbachevs active 
cooperation in cleaning up the worlds environment 
a world solution can begin with the united states and the 
soviet union the president told a republican fundraising 
audience several days ago 
the unraveling of the soviet unions east european dominion of 
course will set the tone for the bushgorbachev talks and dominate 
any agendasetting efforts 
bush has said he intends to discuss the upheaval in detail with 
the soviet leader and will delve into such issues as us trade 
with soviet bloc nations 
but he has been careful to assure the united states european 
allies that he and gorbachev will not discuss any future european 
boundaries that the fate of eastern bloc nations should be theirs 
alone to decide 
white house officials also indicated this week that bush is 
prepared to talk with gorbachev about arms reductions in europe 
even though the administration earlier played down this aspect 
us officials have suggested that the breakup of the warsaw 
pact could provide a golden opportunity for deep cuts in us 
defense spending much of which is earmarked for waging a war in 
europe 
fitzwater said that certainly the two presidents in malta will 
talk about arms control and military force structure 
but bush emphasized tuesday that he would not enter into an 
arms control agreement at the summit and would not catch us 
allies off guard bush is to brief allies in brussels at the 
conclusion of the summit 
if the lowkey projections issuing from the white house this 
week follow an old mold for summitry they also adhere to a pattern 
bush has set in his political life 
bush and his lieutenants did their best to lower expectations 
about bushs 1988 acceptance speech at the republican national 
convention and yet the intensely practiced speech he gave was one 
that many analysts viewed as the best of his career 
the bush camp sought to play down expectations of the 
candidates performance potential before both of his campaign 
debates with democratic contender michael dukakis 
and more recently bush and his lieutenants voiced low 
expectations before mays nato summit in brussels that the session 
would produce anything dramatic or lead to a resolution of the 
alliances intramural dispute over shortrange arms based in west 
germany 
however bush produced a breakthrough compromise that unified 
nato on the arms issue

mikhail gorbachev wants assurances from president 
bush this weekend that the united states will not exploit the 
eastern european reform movement say government officials who add 
the soviet leader hopes for improved trade ties from the superpower 
summit 
gorbachev also will be seeking progress on an array of arms 
control issues as he and bush hold their first summit saturday and 
sunday on us and soviet warships in the waters off malta 
to put it in a nutshell we need a normal external environment 
for our domestic work says gorbachev whose economic 
restructuring program of perestroika has yet to produce measurable 
improvements in the daily life of soviet citizens 
the 58yearold soviet leader will be attending his sixth summit 
with an american president and in circumstances that scarcely 
seemed imaginable a few weeks ago much less when he first sat 
down with president reagan in geneva 
gorbachev has encouraged and endorsed the political changes that 
have brought reformers to power in every eastern bloc nation except 
romania but in the days leading up to the summit he has spoken 
openly of fears that the west may try to exploit the situation 
the most dangerous thing at such moments is that someone may 
become tempted to use them for their own selfish interests he 
said recently 
bush seemed to reply in a speech on nov 22 in which he said 
we will seek president gorbachevs assurance that this process of 
reform in eastern europe will continue and we will give him our 
word that america welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking 
advantage but as a people offering support 
there seems little doubt that gorbachev will underscore his 
commitment to reform 
moscow observers say in jest that gorbachev will possibly 
carry to bush on board the cruiser belknap a fragment of the ruined 
iron curtain the official novisti press agency quipped 
gorbachev says the kremlin will no longer impose its views on 
its allies and may seek a pledge that washington will not for 
example try the sort of endrun the soviets staged by aiding fidel 
castros cuba to bar potential unrest the soviets may even 
endorse massive us assistance poland for example is seeking 1 
billion in western cash 
bushs thanksgiving eve invitation to gorbachev to end decades 
of eastwest confrontation was seized on by the soviets as proof 
the superpowers are on the threshold of a new stage of broad and 
open cooperation in the words of foreign ministry spokesman 
gennady i gerasimov 
the soviets are writing a law allowing virtually unrestricted 
emigration of jews and others that bush wants before recommending 
that the soviets be granted mostfavored nation status to ease 
access of their goods to us markets 
foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze flushed with anger when 
asked whether the summit was called so the kremlin could seek us 
aid for its shortageplagued economy it offends our national 
pride he said 
but pride or not the soviets want us knowhow computers and 
management techniques 
shevardnadze says the soviets want mutually beneficial 
economic and trade cooperation however even if bush agrees to 
loosen controls on hightech exports and upgrade the soviets 
trading status its uncertain how much their staterun enterprises 
could benefit 
as of now they can offer us customers only petroleum and 
vodka and caviar and not much else says commerce secretary 
robert mosbacher 
arms control the centerpiece of past summits is now 
overshadowed by the momentous changes in eastern europe for 
soviets however weapons cuts would be tangible proof that 
gorbachevs new thinking is paying off 
the soviet ideal says viktor a kremenyuk would be a timetable 
fixing goals for the geneva talks on strategic weapons cuts and the 
vienna negotiations on conventional arms in europe kremenyuk is 
the deputy chief of a kremlin think tank studying the united states 
at the last round of geneva talks the two sides approaches 
were so far apart that no convergence was discernible novisti 
charged in frustration the soviets cleared the way for progress by 
dropping their condition that washington agree not to deploy the 
strategic defense initiative and now are hinting malta could break 
remaining logjams 
kremenyuk said the soviets want the 30 percent to 50 percent 
cuts in superpower arsenals envisaged by the proposed strategic 
arms reduction treaty plus a coolingoff of regional conflicts 
like afghanistan so they can shift more resources to the civilian 
economy

president bush while telling a polandbound 
delegation of prominent americans dollars alone wont make the 
difference is sending nearly 1 billion in us aid to poland 
and hungary 
bush used a tuesday evening sendoff reception for the us 
mission to sign legislation providing 938 million for the two east 
bloc nations over the next three years 
in addition agriculture secretary clayton yeutter who heads 
the mission said he will announce a new 20 million installment in 
us food aid on thursday in warsaw 
bush told the presidential panel as it prepared to leave 
washington on its fourday tour of poland that it should give him 
an initial report by phone while he is in malta this weekend for 
his shipboard summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
i want to know how this goes id like to hear it there in 
malta it will give me flexibility in my talks with the general 
secretary bush said 
he said the upheavals sweeping poland and other soviet bloc 
nations would be high on our agenda at the summit 
bush signed the legislation which provides more aid than he had 
sought at a reception for the presidential mission at blair house 
the official guest residence across the street from the white 
house the mission left washington later tuesday night and was to 
return on saturday 
the legislation which bush called a major and positive step 
in bipartisan foreign policy includes programs for poland with a 
value of 8465 million hungary would receive benefits with a 
total value of 915 million 
he said both nations had stirred the imagination of the 
world 
we are nearing the end of a year that future generations will 
remember as a watershed a year when the human spirit was lifted 
and spurred on by the bold and courageous actions of two great 
peoples the people of poland and hungary bush said 
however he said that weve got to recognize the fact that 
dollars alone wont make the difference 
he said the economic miracle of western europe came only 
after full engagement of our private sector in shaping the free 
market system that has generated unprecedented prosperity across 
western europe 
that lesson holds true for poland today bush continued 
our aid must be seen as seed money for free market reform and for 
the involvement of our private sector 
sen paul simon dill chief sponsor of the poland aid bill 
said in a statement after the billsigning now were a partner 
with the forces of freedom in eastern europe were giving 
solidarity a fighting chance to succeed 
yeutter voiced some pessimism on shortterm prospects for 
improved conditions either in poland or in its fastchanging east 
bloc neighbors 
economic reform is not an overnight proposition it will take 
time it would be tragic indeed if all the magnificent emotion of 
the moment is channeled into frustration he told a white house 
news briefing 
the delegation includes yeutter labor secretary elizabeth dole 
commerce secretary robert mosbacher chief white house economist 
michael boskin and 20 representatives of business labor and 
academia 
another two dozen government officials also were expected to 
accompany the delegation 
bush named the delegation last month to focus on those 
economic sectors where us expertise and experience can be of 
greatest assistance he said other missions targeting more 
specific areas would follow 
mrs dole who with her husband senate minority leader bob dole 
visited poland in august predicted a period of some pain as 
poland moves from a stateowned economy to a market economy 
therell be a loss of jobs for some people also as subsidies 
are removed from certain areas there will be an increase in 
prices the labor secretary said 
she said the us government could help the new solidarityled 
government ease the pain by establishing some form of social safety 
net to help workers make it through the inevitable dislocations

the major climate changes that may result from 
global warming are being delayed by 20 years due to less use of 
chlorofluorocarbon gases in the united states and other nations a 
nasa scientist says 
james hansen a researcher at nasas institute for space 
studies said that chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs make up about 25 
percent of the socalled greenhouse gases thought to be causing 
the earth to slowly heat up 
but if production of cfcs had not been reduced in 1974 he said 
tuesday the compound by now would have made up more than half of 
the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the planet would be 
heating faster 
if the growth of cfc production in the early 1970s had 
continued to date hansen says in a paper published in journal of 
geophysical research the cfcs would now cause a much larger 
greenhouse effect greater than that for co2 carbon dioxide 
in an interview hansen said that with an unchecked use of cfcs 
we would get to the large climate changes caused by greenhouse 
forcing or heating in 20 years rather than in 40 years as most 
models theories now predict the cfcs would provide a forcing at 
least as large as co2 
the greenhouse heating effect of cfcs would be three times 
larger now if production of the chemical had not been reduced in 
the 1970s hansen said 
cfcs once were used as a propellant in cans of such products as 
hair spray paint and household cleaners when studies showed that 
the chemical compound could harm the atmosphere the use of cfcs as 
a propellant was stopped in the united states canada and in some 
european countries starting in 1974 there was a sharp reduction 
in the production of cfcs 
the chemical however continues to be used as a refrigerant and 
in some industrial applications 
in addition to contributing to the greenhouse heating of the 
atmosphere some cfcs also cause a depletion in the ozone layer of 
the stratosphere high level ozone blocks solar ultraviolet rays a 
principle cause of skin cancer as a result of this ozone problem 
the united states and some other nations have agreed to stop 
production of some cfcs in the 1990s and to develop other chemical 
compounds to use as refrigerants 
hansen said that manmade gases principally carbon dioxide in 
the atmosphere are thought to have caused the earth to retain an 
additional 2 watts of heat energy per square meter since 1890 
he and other scientists predict that this heat retention will 
increase to about 4 watts per square meter in about four decades if 
the rate of carbon dioxide dumped into the atmosphere by human 
activities continues at its present increasing rate 
exactly how and when this will affect the earths temperature is 
a matter of controversy hansen said because of the uncertainty 
in climate sensitivity 
but some experts have expressed fears that increasing the 
temperature of the earth by only a few degrees could force a rise 
in ocean levels and seriously affect food production by changing 
the climate in major farm areas 
the greenhouse effect is caused by atmospheric gases that act 
rather like a blanket by keeping heat from radiating from the earth 
into space this could gradually force the globe to warm 
carbon dioxide the principle greenhouse gas is produced by 
combustion such as in the burning of oil gas coal and wood

district of columbia investigators plan to 
question police officials who in 1983 reviewed allegations that 
mayor marion barry was hospitalized for drug overdoses a published 
report says 
barry released a statement tuesday night calling the allegations 
outrageous and adding i went to the hospital because i had a 
sharp pain across my chest i wasnt using illegal drugs then or 
at any other time 
the washington post today quoted unnamed police sources as 
saying that police chief isaac fulwood jr has ordered an internal 
investigation into the handling of the allegations 
wusatv reported monday that barry was hospitalized for cocaine 
overdoses at howard university and dc general hospital in 1983 
according to allegations made to police nine months later by dr 
alyce gullattee a howard university drug abuse specialist 
on tuesday former police chief maurice t turner said gullattee 
came to him with the allegations and he turned them over to the 
departments internal affairs division which was then unable to 
verify her account 
basically the investigation revealed it was unsubstantiated 
allegations said turner a republican who is an unannounced 
candidate for mayor in next years election 
turner confirmed that barry was not treated by gullattee in 
either instance he also said gullattees information came from her 
patients and she had no firsthand knowledge of the mayors medical 
treatment 
donald c thomas a physician who was then the director of the 
dc general hospitals emergency room said barry underwent a 
checkup for several hours before he was released and was told to 
take it easy thomas who supervised barrys care said there was 
no indication that barry had been using drugs 
turner scoffed at suggestions that either he or the police 
officers handling the case might have muddled the investigation to 
protect the mayor 
why waste 32 years on the police force to cover up something 
like this turner told wrctv its just not worth it 
at the time officials said barry had been hospitalized for 
flareups of a hiatal hernia problem 
a spokesman for the us attorneys office said tuesday there 
was insufficient evidence to open an investigation 
barrys activities already are under federal grand jury 
investigation in connection with convicted drug dealer charles 
lewis who said in open court that he bought drugs for barry 
turner said he has known gullattee for about 12 years he told 
wusatv on tuesday that she told police investigators she knew a 
7yearold boy who was a drug addict that story was the subject of 
a washington post article by janet cook which won a 1981 pulitzer 
prize the newspaper was forced to return the award when cook 
admitted that the boy was fictional 
police exhausted a lot of resources trying to find the boy 
whom gullattee said she knew turner added 
gullattee did not return several telephone calls to her office 
on tuesday

edward cook got a bit unglued when the us postal 
service refused to accept its own newly issued nolick stamp 
not only did it return his letter the postman charged him 25 
cents to return it and to make matters worse the stamps cost an 
extra 3 cents each 
i didnt want to pay 28 cents for a stamp i could get for 25 
cents but my wife wanted to try them cook said 
cook a 57yearold airline consultant was trying to send a 
letter to his daughter at stanford university but it never got 
past the san francisco post office which didnt recognize the 
postal services latest invention 
dick able director of marketing for the postal service in 
denver which was chosen as the test market for the stamps said 
somebody apparently didnt get the word 
we probably did our usual terrible job of internal marketing 
and didnt let our employees know we were test marketing this 
able said 
he said there has been a recent surge in demand for the stamp 
adding we dont know if its because they like them or they 
think these will be the first last and only version and theyll 
become a collectors item 
meantime the postal service is getting out of the sticky 
situation by offering cook free delivery of his letter and an 
apology 
cook however said im sure not buying any more

a judge ruled that the latest sports 
videotape featuring comedian tim conways diminutive dorf 
character can be shipped to stores despite a distributors claim 
that it was unfairly cut out of the deal 
superior court judge kurt j lewin ruled tuesday that j2 
communications inc has first right of refusal for distribution of 
dorf videos only when they are produced by longshot enterprises 
inc of which conway is the majority owner 
lewin cited a contract between j2 and longshot which began 
producing the dorf series in 1986 conways costumed character 
derk dorf is supposed to be 4 feet tall 
j2 distributed the first three dorf videos dorf on 
golf dorf and the first games of mt olympus and dorfs 
golf bible 
lewin said the story idea and production of the new dorf goes 
auto racing came from liaison east inc so the distribution 
contract between j2 and longshot does not apply 
j2 filed suit nov 8 against conway and longshot alleging 
breach of contract and good faith 
the next day lewin temporarily barred distribution of dorf 
goes auto racing which had been scheduled for release nov 15 
liaison attorney deborah drooz said the company now will negotiate 
with its sponsors for a new release date

involvement as an architect of american policy 
at the news conference kissinger called the recent reforms in 
eastern europe one of the most important and in many ways 
pregnant moments since the end of world war ii

a report by the agriculture departments 
watchdog agency says some big farm operators are still collecting 
crop subsidies in excess of limits set by congress 
in one case the departments office of inspector general said 
tuesday a single farm operation collected about 28 million in 
subsidies 56 times the 50000 limit set by law 
the report did not identify the recipient of the huge payment 
and inspector general officials refused to provide further details 
however the reports appendix showed a maximum payment 
limitation for jackson county ark with an audit figure of 
2867614 in questioned costs and loans 
the entry also showed that 2788077 of the total as 
unsupported costs and loans by the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service the agency that handles 
commodity subsidy programs 
other areas of abuse also were cited in the agencys semiannual 
report to congress on investigative and audit activities during the 
six months that ended sept 30 
those abuses included crop insurance overpayments loopholes in 
debt restructuring by the farmers home administration and flaws in 
the export subsidy program 
by law the crop subsidies called deficiency payments are 
not supposed to exceed 50000 per person per year these are 
direct payments to help make up the difference between depressed 
market prices and higher target prices set by the government 
for example last month the price of corn at the farm was 220 
a bushel the target price for 1989 corn is 284 
a person can be an individual a joint stock company a 
corporation an association a trust or some other legal entity 
the report said abuses in the program continued despite 
efforts by congress in the 1987 omnibus reconciliation act to close 
loopholes overall in 1987 an estimated 66 million was paid to 
farmers who dodged the 50000 limitation 
investigators have found that big operators often reorganize to 
qualify additional persons for the purpose of collecting larger 
payments 
in one case an individual used relatives employees and 
business associates as persons under the program the report 
said those totaled at least 21 in 1986 and 29 in 1987 payments 
totaled about 28 million for the two years plus more in 1988 and 
1989 which are under review by the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service 
we have recommended that ascs improve its review procedures 
and withhold 1989 payments until final eligibility is determined 
the report said 
the chairman of the senate agriculture committee sen patrick 
leahy dvt said of the report 
outrageous payments such as these undermine public support for 
farmers a few bad apples are giving all farmers a bad name 
a spokesman for the national farmers union michael v dunn 
said loopholes are something weve been concerned about for a 
long time 
we end up with subsidies going to all types of corporations 
and corporate investors dunn said we have long advocated 
targeting those payments to family sized operations 
other findings of the inspector generals report included 
loss adjustment errors by the federal crop insurance corp and 
reinsured private companies resulted in overpayments estimated at 
91 million out of 716 million paid out in claims underpayments 
totaled 16 million 
under farmers home administration debtrestructuring 
procedures borrowers were able to sell off security property and 
still qualify for buyout benefits buyouts allow borrowers to 
have debts written off by fmha after buying back the note at 30 
cents on the dollar based on the value of the remaining property 
held as collateral 
for example one borrower improperly disposed of a portion of 
collateral securing outstanding debt totaling 160000 the 
report said 
however since the borrower qualified for the buyout fmha 
allowed the borrower to buyout the debt for about 30 cents on the 
dollar a loss to the government of 112000 
the report recommended fmha seek legislation that would deny a 
buyout to anyone who demonstrated a lack of good faith under 
the debtrestructuring program 
subsidized sales of farm commodities to designated foreign 
countries are provided under the export enhancement program or 
eep private exporting companies collect the subsidies or bonuses 
in the form of surplus commodities held by the departments 
commodity credit corp 
the subsidies enable the exporters to charge foreign customers 
lower prices than otherwise would be the case that enables us 
products to compete in overseas markets with other suppliers 
notably the european economic community which has export subsidy 
programs of its own 
but investigators said they found that some countries in the 
program do not show strong competition with us commodities 
overall the report questioned eep bonus payments of 151 million 
for transportation costs which may not be allowed by federal 
law and payments of 898 million that resulted from a possible 
miscalculation of world prices

the actor stuck out his chin pursed his lips and 
flipped his wrist in a questioning gesture and the laughter that 
exploded from the disbelieving audience proved everyone knew who he 
was supposed to be 
only one person a young woman in third row center at moscows 
satire theater bent her head and appeared more traumatized than 
amused by the parody of president mikhail s gorbachev 
she was his daughter irina 
clearly upset she left friday nights performance of emigre 
writer vladimir voinovichs courtroom comedy the tribunal 
before the curtain call 
but if she could not laugh at her father the rest of the 
audience could in a way they could never publicly laugh at a 
soviet leader before 
in one of the ironies of gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
greater openness he has become the butt of jokes by a growing 
group of fearless comics who once could not have dreamed of 
mocking the countrys leader at least not in public and not while 
he was alive 
the tribunal is not especially biting the new court 
chairman played by vyacheslav bezrukov speaks with a southern 
russian accent that turns gs into hs darts his eyes constantly 
and proposes a commission as the best solution to festering 
injustice 
the light mockery would roll off the back of a western leader 
accustomed to unflattering caricatures and tasteless scatalogical 
jokes but it is still scandalous in moscow 
even the outspoken host of one of soviet televisions most 
daring programs vzglyad or glance said in a recent broadcast 
that when he heard a mild joke about gorbachev on the nightly news 
my heart jumped 
its hard to get used to relating to state leaders without 
standing at attention alexander lyubimov said 
the broadcast featured moscow comic mikhail grushevsky who 
performed a telephone imitation of gorbachev that captured not only 
his throaty timbre and homey style but his habit of speaking in 
fits and starts and veering off from phrases before finishing them 
telephone is not the best way to communicate grushevskys 
gorbachev said although you know sometimes its also a way to 
solve some kind of knotty problem and some so to speak to move 
ahead 
grushevsky said his audiences seem to laugh partly because they 
are so unaccustomed to hearing the voices of political leaders 
coming from the stage 
and some laughter comes from relief that its ok that the 
concert is going on and no one will come afterward and take me 
away he told lyubimov now people have started to get used to 
it and thank god for that 
the satire theaters 80yearold artistic director valentin 
pluchek said authorities have closed him down often in the past 
when shows were too politically salty but he didnt expect that 
kind of trouble any longer 
thats all over pluchek said after fridays performance of 
the tribunal 
told that gorbachevs daughter was in the audience plucheks 
wife zinaida warned now papa will come and forbid it 
but pluchek dismissed her worries 
he shouldnt be offended he said we respect him in a 
democratic society an artist should have the right to make a 
friendly caricature of the leader 
several days later the theater director alexander levinsky 
said he had not received any reprimands from above 
not all imitations are quite so innocuous 
another moscow comic mikhail zadornov does a routine that 
appears to highlight the soviet leaders occasional lapses in 
grammar and speech 
comrades comrades comrades he said in a recent 
performance despite this responsible speech i will speak without 
a little paper yes ill give you all a lesson on literate 
speaking i will i will yes 
the speech that follows contains a variety of exaggerated 
grammatical errors and malapropisms typical of uneducated russians 
and includes a pledge that we wont let just anyone who wants to 
dirty up our mother tongue we have our head behind our shoulders 
for all the public parodies many jokes about gorbachev still 
have not made their way onto the airwaves or into print 
when he first came to power in 1985 and introduced an 
antialcohol campaign wits turned his title of general 
secretary into mineral secretary a reference to the mineral 
water resorted to by drinkers deprived of wine and vodka 
many jokes have focused on his close relationship with his wife 
raisa portraying her as everpresent and domineering 
an anecdote now making the rounds in moscow has a wellknown 
psychic thrown into prison because he made gorbachevs hair grow 
out and cover his birthmark and now he can only be recognized 
because his wife is with him 
far more devastating anecdotes abounded about former leaders but 
circulated only by wordofmouth or in emigre publications 
the tribunal broke new ground in its public mockery of past 
leaders as well such as leonid i brezhnev and other members of 
the pregorbachev gerontocracy it depicts brezhnev as a doddering 
senile old man who unzips his pants near a marble statue because he 
cant distinguish it from a urinal

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
hell be looking for ways to make poland a paying customer for 
american goods as he leads an economic assistance mission there 
this week 
a lot of the focus on poland has been on aid and assistance 
yeutter said tuesday but that kind of help is transitory 
the us delegation arriving in poland today will look for ways 
to keep the country from becoming overly dependent on others said 
yeutter adding that poland should be helped to stand on its own 
two feet 
if all goes well poland and other east bloc countries that are 
opening to the west will be better customers yeutter said 
congress has approved a 533 million aid package for poland and 
hungary 125 million of which is food aid 
yeutters remarks came at outlook 90 an annual conference 
sponsored by the agriculture department to examine farm policies 
and factors that affect them 
he left tuesday night for four days in poland with a delegation 
of 20 privatesector representatives commerce secretary robert 
mosbacher labor secretary elizabeth dole and michael boskin 
chairman of the white house council of economic advisers 
boskin who also spoke at the conference was asked if the 
changes in the east bloc will affect the us economy 
the united states has a 5 trillion economy with a very small 
amount of trade with eastern europe boskin said we believe we 
will be able to help with restructuring their economies 
he said the outlook for the us economy was strong predicting 
that interest rates would decrease thereby helping the 
agricultural sector 
questions also were raised about progress of international trade 
talks known as gatt yeutter said the united states had submitted 
its final proposal and received positive reaction except from the 
european community 
however he said that didnt bother him because he expected the 
united states would reject the european proposals as well he said 
a negotiated agreement would be reached eventually 
yeutter and us trade representative carla hills emphasized 
that the united states is not trying to remove all subsidies 
internationally 
the question is how those supports are designed yeutter 
said they ought to be designed to minimize distortions in 
trade 
hills said the united states was working to open roadblocks to 
free trade worldwide in response to a question she criticized 
japan for its closed trade policies 
no one has gained so much from an open market system as the 
japanese hills said 
she praised japans expertise in exporting and investing but 
said other countries could begin to shut out japan if it doesnt 
increase its imports 
as for the effect of gatt on the 1990 farm bill yeutter and two 
members of congress said legislation could be passed and then 
revised to accommodate agreements stemming from the trade talks 
rep edward madigan rill said that while congress would not 
be willing to change its subsidy policies without reciprocation it 
might pass legislation calling for adjustments if other countries 
were to embrace the us proposal at gatt 
it remains to be seen what we are handed after the gatt 
talks said rep tim johnson dsd 
yeutter said he didnt think congress debate on the 1990 farm 
bill would effect the gatt talks 
i see it working out just fine as long as ambassador hills can 
convince our trading partners we can take back the agreement and 
get it approved by congress yeutter said 
meanwhile a paper presented at the conference predicted next 
years food prices would rise at a slower pace as farmers continue 
expanding crop production 
james r donald chairman of the agriculture departments world 
agricultural board said record meat production bigger crops and 
slowing inflation will hold the retail food prices increase to 3 
percent to 5 percent 
food prices this year are rising nearly 6 percent the sharpest 
annual increase since 1981 part of the reason for this years 
runup prices gained 41 percent on the average in 1988 were the 
lingering effects of last years drought 
world crop production is recovering from last years reduced 
level he said but for most crops production in 1989 will 
not match continued high levels of use 
next year donald said world commodity consumption will reach a 
record level in response to larger output continued economic 
expansion and population growth

the government wont realize as much as 
originally estimated in annual savings from closing or realigning 
15 us military bases a lawmaker says 
rep james saxton rnj said tuesday that a study by the 
general accounting office found that the shutdown or scaling back 
of 15 bases will result in 453 million in savings instead of the 
622 million per year estimated by a federal commission 
among the bases are fort dix in new jersey chanute air force 
base in illinois and the presidio in california 
the gao the investigative arm of congress was scheduled to 
release the report today 
the incredible fact of the matter is that we are even farther 
away from realizing the 2 billion to 5 billion a year that 
congress was looking for when it started this base closing 
process saxton said in a statement 
overall the congressionally established commission on base 
realignment and closure recommended in january closing 86 military 
bases and scaling back five more a proposal accepted by 
thendefense secretary frank carlucci 
congress overwhelmingly backed the plan but a handful of 
lawmakers complained that the commission had used faulty data in 
the cases of some of the bases the closings and realignments are 
to be completed by sept 30 1995 
members of congress asked the gao this summer to determine the 
cost and longterm savings of closing or realigning 15 of the bases 
and moving military personnel congressional efforts to stop the 
closings if the gao found that the savings will not exceed the 
shutdown costs failed 
saxton whose district includes fort dix said the gao 
determined that the elimination of basic and advanced training at 
the base will result in only half of the 845 million savings 
estimated by the commission 
he also said that the gao found that the changes at the base 
would eliminate only 54 percent of the 2167 jobs projected by the 
commission fort dix will lose 613 military personnel not the 
1306 originally estimated and 554 civilian jobs instead of the 
861 anticipated by the commission saxton quoted the gao as saying 
to the gaos credit it has been able to account for some 
savings of taxpayers dollars from the realignment of fort dix 
saxton said noting however that the gao study underscored his 
contention that earlier estimates were flawed 
the gaos work indicates that inaccurate data was used and 
that personnel cuts and savings were grossly exaggerated he said 
pentagon spokesman glenn flood said defense secretary dick 
cheney stands by the work that was done by the commission 
the gao had pretty much already hinted that their report would 
say something like that flood said there was more than one 
criterion that the commission looked at not just the payback in 
savings we looked at many different things 
the 15 bases are the presidio george air force base mather air 
force base norton air force base and hunters point naval station 
all in california pease air force base in new hampshire fort 
sheridan and chanute air force base in illinois jefferson proving 
ground in indiana fort dix in new jersey lexington army depot in 
kentucky fort meade and fort holabird in maryland fort devens in 
massachusetts and fort huachuca in arizona

government civil rights officials say they 
will respond by middecember to complaints that the bush 
administration is not committed to ensuring equal education 
opportunities 
i come here proud of this record william smith temporary 
head of the education departments civil rights efforts told the 
house education and labor committee on tuesday 
i believe that the office of civil rights has done a good 
job of enforcing these civil rights statutes and ensuring an equal 
educational opportunity for all americans 
but smith conceded that he had failed to respond to committee 
queries some dating to late october he promised written responses 
by dec 16 
after almost one year in office there seem to have been no 
substantive efforts to improve the office of civil rights dismal 
enforcement record and there has not even been a nomination for 
permanent assistant secretaries of civil rights enforcement in 
either the department of education or the department of justice 
said rep major r owens dny 
members of the committee cited a yearold staff report that 
found an apparently deliberate and very effective system by 
which civil rights laws were not enforced 
although the reporting period was during the reagan 
administration panel members insisted the bush administration had 
done little to correct the situation 
apparently ensuring equal education opportunity for all 
american children is not very high on our education presidents 
list of priorities owens said 
many black people and organizations have given up on ocr 
said phyllis mcclure of the naacp legal defense and educational 
fund inc 
i have personally encountered individuals who believe that it 
would be pointless to file a complaint against their school 
system because ocr would not do anything to correct the violations 
or because doing so would subject black school officials to 
retaliation she said 
according to the report issued last december by the committees 
democratic staff 58 percent of investigations closed between 
fiscal years 1983 and 1988 were concluded with a finding of no 
violation 
between 19811988 the civil rights office initiated 9768 
complaint investigations the majority of which related to handicap 
discrimination 
only 15 percent of the complaints involved allegations of race 
discrimination 17 percent related to gender discrimination and 3 
percent to national origin discrimination 
the report also pointed to major cuts in budget and staff for 
civil rights activities and to confused policy directives 
administration mismanagement numerous changes in leadership and 
severe reductions in resources 
in recent years we have been in the vanguard in our efforts 
to eliminate dual systems of higher education said james p 
turner temporary head of the civil rights division at the justice 
department 
committee members were not impressed 
rep charles hayes dill said that all three major higher 
education cases handled by the departments are still pending 
one of the best defenses that this nation can ever have is not 
found in whether or not we can explore the outer space or build a 
new bomber but in whether or not we can educate our young 
irrespective of their race creed color or sex or financial 
status hayes said 
committee chairman augustus hawkins dcalif said he was 
disappointed in the agencies 
you seem to be proud of your record he said i havent 
read any report that commends you or says that youre doing a good 
job you seem to be operating on the theory that you can do more 
with less which is a lot of baloney you know that its nothing 
but double talk

helmut kohl dazzled his countrymen 
with his vision of a united germany within a united europe but 
east germanys leaders apparently see kohls ideas as something of 
a trojan horse laden with suspicious cargo 
kohl on tuesday outlined a 10point plan to gradually unite the 
two german states saying he wants reunification but acknowledging 
it could take time 
the chancellor wrapped his ideas into a farreaching concept of 
overcoming the overall divisions of europe stepping up disarmament 
and forging closer links between the european economic community 
and eastern europe 
kohls proposals are specific in some areas but appear general 
enough to save him from criticism at home that he is being too 
meddlesome in east german domestic affairs 
his speech is already being hailed as probably the greatest of 
his political career even by some usually severe critics 
during kohls years in office seldom has there been the 
opportunity to praise the chancellor for a speech the newspaper 
stuttgarter nachtrichten said in a commentary today 
but the newspaper said of tuesdays address to parliament 
helmut kohl has given an important speech if not a historic 
one 
kohls speech even won praise from opposition politicians who 
have steadfastly maintained in recent weeks that while east germany 
was falling apart the chancellor has been too slow in producing 
needed assistance for the embattled communist neighbor 
hansjochen vogel kohls arch foe as head of the opposition 
social democrats presented his own plan for closer ties with east 
germany it had much in common with kohls the chief difference 
was vogel spoke out for a loose german confederation and said 
nothing about formal reunification 
karsten voigt an important social democrat lawmaker said he 
agrees with the chancellor on all 10 points and offered to help 
fulfill them 
nonetheless voigt cautioned kohl against telling the east 
germans what sort of future they should choose for their country 
even though kohl made it clear he still wants formal german 
reunification at some point his vagueness on what he foresees in 
the shortterm has annoyed east germanys communist leaders 
kohl proposed that the two german states set up confederative 
structures such as joint government bodies for regular 
consultations 
east germans might be interested in a confederation if it 
ensures their country would not be swallowed up into a single 
german federation but that would be at odds with kohls proposals 
wolfgang meyer spokesman for the east german government said 
kohls mention of confederative structures was heard with 
interest 
but meyer said kohl avoided saying clearly that it could only 
concern a confederation between two sovereign nations 
reunification is not on the agenda and no one in the east or 
the west is earnest about changing european stability he said 
east german communist party leader egon krenz said a united 
germany would raise thoughts of nazi germany of 1937 and i know 
no one in the world who would like such a germany 
kohl also repeated his view that without a total overhaul of 
east germanys planned economy massive west german assistance 
would be throwing money away 
we do do not want to stabilize conditions which have become 
indefensible kohl said 
and on that point as well kohls 10point plan earned him 
little trust among east german leaders who fear disappearance of 
their socialist system could increase their vulnerability to 
reunification 
we are ready to cooperate with the federal republic west 
germany but we are not to get into conditions or 
prerequisites krenz said

germans provided the east german government also contributes 
substantially east germany also must drop its requirement that 
west german tourists exchange at least 25 marks 1350 in hard 
currency per day while visiting east germany 
2 existing areas of cooperation of mutual benefit should be 
expanded particularly in economics technology culture and 
environmental protection east germanys telephone network should 
be upgraded talks on expanded rail ties and connection of the east 
german system to other european states should be opened 
3 jointventure projects should be legalized and encouraged 
electoral reforms should be implemented to allow free elections and 
secret ballots the communist party must give up its guaranteed 
power monopoly bureaucratic planning and administrative practices 
must be phased out private businesses should be established and 
western investments solicited 
4 joint institutions and committees in economics transport 
ecology science and technology health and culture shouldbe 
established 
5 west germany is willing to develop step by step the 
structures of a federation with a legitimate democratically 
elected east german government envisioned is establishment of 
joint government committees for continuous consultations and 
political decisionmaking joint special committees and joint 
parliament commissions 
6 the future design of germany must fit in with the future 
design of a whole europe with full respect for the integrity and 
security of each state full respect for human rights including 
the right of selfdetermination 
7 west germany recommends a speedy decision on a trade and 
cooperation agreement with east germany that expands and ensures 
east german access to the european common market 
8 the confidencebuilding process in europe is the heart of the 
design of a whole europe and must be energetically pursued 
9 overcoming the division of europe and the division of germany 
requires wideranging energetic steps in disarmament and arms 
control which must keep pace with political advances this applies 
particularly to the vienna negotiations on conventional arms in 
europe agreement on confidence building measures and a ban on 
chemical weapons it also requires reducing the nuclear potential 
of the superpowers to strategic minimums 
10 the political approach aims to foster peace in europe in 
which the german people can achieve unity through 
selfdeterminationgerman unity remains a goal of the federal 
government only in a climate of mutual trust can the division of 
europe and germany be overcome

barbara bushs nettlesome graves disease 
which causes teary eyes and double vision isnt getting any 
better but doctors say it isnt getting any worse 
its fairly stable mrs bushs spokeswoman anna perez told 
reporters after the first lady returned tuesday evening from the 
mayo clinic in rochester minn 
the eyes have not gotten worse shes not out of the woods 
yet shes not cured shes still got the disease ms perez said 
the doctors examined mrs bush for two hours performing tests 
and putting two doses of drops in her eyes they decided to vary 
the doses of prednisone she is taking for the condition ms perez 
said 
otherwise there was to be no treatment change 
believe me when i tell you nothing is worse everything is 
better im going home with very good news for george bush the 
first lady told the rochester postbulletin 
the longrange prognosis is unclear ms perez said adding that 
mrs bush was in fine spirits but acknowledged annoyance with 
the disease 
these are some of the best times of her life and sometimes it 
is a pain to have to see everything twice ms perez said 
mrs bushs condition which initially caused a noticeable 
weight loss was diagnosed earlier this year she has regained some 
weight through water retention due to the prednisone 
she underwent a radiation treatment in april to treat the excess 
hormone levels produced by her thyroid that treatment was 
successful and the hormone levels are now fine ms perez said 
two mayo clinic ophthalmologists dr robert waller and dr 
john dyer were on the team of physicians who earlier examined and 
treated mrs bush for the eye condition 
graves disease thought to be related to the immune system 
brings on an overactive thyroid which in turn produces excessive 
amounts of certain hormones symptoms include fatigue insomnia and 
swelling of eye tissues causing irritation 
the cause of the disease is unknown but it can be controlled 
with drugs 
after the tests tuesday mrs bush stopped by a rochester 
library and read a story to a group of children before returning to 
washington

the aflcio says its hopes of sending a 
delegation to meet with striking soviet miners this week were 
dashed when soviet officials refused to issue visas 
federation officials said tuesday that the soviets told them it 
wasnt an appropriate time for an american delegation to visit the 
striking miners in the arctic circle city of vorkuta 
we are hopeful that it will be put together for another day 
another time said aflcio spokesman rex hardesty we are 
continuing to talk with the soviets but we have abandoned the 
timetable 
the aflcio requested visas for the fivemember delegation after 
receiving a telegram from the striking soviet miners two weeks ago 
the miners praised the federations efforts to help polands 
solidarity and requested help in forming a free trade union 
they soviet officials gave us the standard response that 
this would not be a good time that this would not be a beneficial 
time given the sensitive situation said eric chenoweth of the 
aflcios international affairs department one of those who 
requested a visa 
our intent was not to exacerbate the situation but to respond 
to the requests of the workers who invited us to investigate the 
conditions that brought them to strike he said it is our 
position that just because there are sensitive conditions doesnt 
mean that a delegation should not be allowed 
calls to the soviet embassy for comment were not immediately 
returned 
the telegram from the miners requested that the aflcio provide 
information on us labor laws and union organizing and said the 
workers were struggling not only for their rights but to end the 
communist partys leading role in soviet governance 
aflcio president lane kirklands request for the visas also 
asked that the delegation be allowed to travel to moscow and 
vorkuta and to meet privately with the miners he asked for a 
response in time for the trip to begin by the end of this week 
the delegation was to be led by albert shanker president of the 
american federation of teachers it was to include john t joyce 
president of the bricklayers union john banovic secretary 
treasurer of the united mine workers ken young a top aide to 
kirkland and chenoweth 
official soviet media have described the miners and other 
strikers as threats to president mikhail gorbachevs economic 
reforms gorbachev last month proposed a law banning strikes in 
some vital industries including coal mining

its official the smithsonian institution 
will build a national museum of the american indian as the newest 
attraction on the mall 
president bush signed legislation tuesday night clearing the way 
for officials to start designing the museum which will draw most 
of its artwork and artifacts from a worldfamed collection in new 
york city 
the measure also outlines the policy for returning american 
indian and native hawaiian human remains and funerary objects to 
the tribes and organizations for burial it requires the 
smithsonian to inventory all human remains in its collections 
bush expressed great pleasure in signing the legislation 
the result of a political compromise after new york lawmakers 
fought to keep the indian museum in new york 
the heart of the museums collection will come from the museum 
of the american indian run by the heye foundation in new york city 
the compromise includes the opening of a 25 million satellite 
facility in the old us custom house in lower manhattan which 
will be called the george gustav heye center of the national museum 
of the american indian 
the smithsonian will build the 106 million museum on the mall 
between the air and space museum and the botanical gardens near 
the foot of capitol hill and build a 44 million storage and 
conservation center in suitland md for the indian artifacts 
from this point our nation will go forward with a new and 
richer understanding of the heritage culture and values of the 
peoples of the americas of indian ancestry bush said 
the heye foundations collection is considered priceless but 
the museum in new york has not attracted the crowds or the 
financial backing that the smithsonian museums in the nations 
capital garner 
indian tribal leaders and native hawaiian groups for years have 
demanded the return of human remains kept in museum collections 
bush said the smithsonian will attempt to identify the origins 
of such remains and objects and will notify the appropriate tribes 
and organizations of its findings 
the ultimate plan he said is for repatriation of the 
remains 
this has been a difficult and complex issue to address 
involving traditional values of american indian people the medial 
and scientific research value of the remains and objects and the 
trust responsibilities of the smithsonian bush said 
the law authorizes 10 million in planning and design 
expenditures for fiscal 1990 which began two months ago the 
department of the interiors 1990 appropriation includes 55 
million in actual funds to start the work 
the federal government will split the cost of revamping the 
customs house in manhattan with new york city and new york state

a federal judge says the pittston co violated 
securities regulations by voting proxies against three proposals 
submitted by striking miners at its annual meeting 
pittston did not have discretionary authority to vote 
managements proxies against the unions proposals us district 
judge norma holloway johnson said tuesday 
the judge upheld the united mine workers challenge on grounds 
the union proposals werent mentioned on the cards shareholders 
signed to give management proxy power 
johnson rejected pittstons arguments that it had 
discretionary authority to vote the proxies against the union 
proposals in may because it had indicated in other material sent to 
shareholders that it intended to oppose them 
nowhere in these letters did pittston actually disclose what 
the three proposals were johnson said 
the judge said pittstons argument ignored regulations promoting 
an informed shareholder electorate and if accepted could lead 
to a world where shareholders could be misled and where corporate 
suffrage could be circumvented by way of overbroad claims of 
discretionary authority 
umw president richard trumka called the decision a resounding 
blow for shareholder rights at every american corporation 
attempts to reach pittston officials late tuesday afternoon were 
unsuccessful calls to the companys connecticut headquarters were 
unanswered 
pittston whose pittston coal group subsidiary is locked in a 
bitter labor dispute with about 1700 miners in virginia west 
virginia and kentucky used its proxies to defeat union proposals 
to submit a poison pill antitakeover plan to shareholders to 
allow shareholders to vote by secret ballot and to form a committee 
to study possible divestiture of some assets 
had pittston not usedthe 155 million management proxies it 
held union officials say the first two proposals would have been 
approved 
johnson said reaching a remedy would prove to be a difficult 
task because shareholders have changed since the vote six months 
ago and ordered company and union attorneys to suggest possible 
remedies within two weeks 
the miners struck pittston coal group in april largely in a 
dispute over pittstons intention to withdraw from an industrywide 
contract to provide medical and retirement benefits to umw retirees 
the union has been fined more than 30 million for violating 
picketing laws during the sometimes violent strike and pittstons 
coal production is off significantly despite its use of replacement 
workers and some miners who refused to honor pickets 
labor secretary elizabeth dole last month appointed former labor 
secretary wj usery jr to mediate usery has met repeatedly with 
both sides and talks are scheduled to resume this week

the energy department says it will be 2010 
before the nations first permanent dump for highly radioactive 
nuclear waste opens seven years later than the original date 
the plan im announcing sets the operating date for a 
repository at 2010 and assumes that there will be no unexpected 
setbacks in the programs progress and that the science proves that 
yucca mountain is a suitable site deputy energy secretary henson 
moore said in a speech tuesday night 
i am convinced that the 2003 date was driven more by a 
political desire than by science or engineering moore told the 
american nuclear society and the us council for energy awareness 
a nuclear industry group in san francisco a copy of the speech 
was released in washington 
moore also said the department would 
seek to sue nevada to force granting of permits for certain 
tests at the yucca mountain site near las vegas that the department 
is considering 
delay sinking exploratory shafts at yucca mountain 
ask congress to let it build an interim storage facility before 
the permanent depot is in hand 
the department is required by law to take title in 1998 to the 
highly radioactive spent fuel stored at more than 100 operating 
civilian nuclear power plants 
the 1982 legislation establishing the waste repository program 
envisioned that a waste depot able to hold spent fuel for 10000 
years would be in operation in 1998 
the department has long wanted a plant capable of temporary 
storage to package the waste for permanent storage and ship it to 
the permanent repository 
a temporary storage depot is called monitored retrievable 
storage or mrs congress fearing an mrs plant would end up 
being the permanent repository has forbidden construction of such 
a plant until the permanent repository is too far along to be 
stopped 
by decoupling the mrs option from the permanent repository 
the department could be able to accept spent fuel from utilities in 
1998 or soon thereafter and would be able to show that it can 
package ship and handle the spent fuel safely moore said 
he said the department will delay shaftsinking until 1992 and 
perform only surfacebased testing starting in 1991 to make 
sure there is nothing that would rule out yucca mountain before the 
expensive shafts are undertaken 
the nuclear regulatory commission told the department this 
summer that it should delay sinking the shafts until it understood 
better the earthquake and volcanic potential of the site 
moore said the department had not received its first state air 
and land use permits two years after requesting them and the state 
was refusing to consider the federal applications the state 
legislature has passed a bill forbidding the storage of nuclear 
waste in the state 
this is not a reasonable response but one we can only conclude 
is driven by politics and a lack of desire to cooperate in the 
proper scientific evaluation of the site court is not our 
preferred course of action but enough is enough moore said in 
announcing that the department had asked the justice department to 
sue for the needed permits 
if nevada does not respond to the required 30day notice of a 
suit justice will file in january and we will get on with the 
program moore said 
congress in 1982 ordered the department to study three possible 
sites later in what some nevada officials called an everybody 
gangs up on nevada bill congress instructed the department to 
study the yucca mountain site on the governments nuclear weapons 
test range in detail first and make that the waste repository if 
nothing turned up to rule it out

the justice department is moving to quash 
subpoenas issued by pan american airlines for documents in 
government files about the investigation of the explosion of flight 
103 
the airline wants the information to defend itself against 
lawsuits filed by relatives of those killed in the dec 21 bombing 
over lockerbie scotland that left 270 people dead 
in a brief statement tuesday night the justice department said 
it moved in a sealed court request last week to quash the subpoenas 
served on six government agencies including the fbi and cia 
while federal judges in brooklyn ny and washington declined 
to grant the governments request pan am was directed to narrow 
its request for information 
the department said pan am lawyers were told to submit a draft 
court order seeking information about how the suitcase with the 
bomb made its way aboard the flight 
the department reserves the right to challenge the request for a 
court order said agency spokesman david runkel 
runkel said the department moved to quash the subpoenas on the 
grounds that information in government files was part of an active 
criminal investigation and thus did not have to be produced 
meanwhile a government source says that clothing fragments from 
the suitcase containing the bomb that destroyed the flight have 
been traced to a store in malta 
the fragments found at the crash site were linked to a suitcase 
that held the radio cassette player believed to have contained the 
explosive device the source said tuesday speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
a multinational team of investigators have traced the clothing 
fragments to a store in malta lending credence to information that 
the bomb passed through that mediterranean island the source said 
british newspapers had previously reported the malta clothing 
link 
the investigation is trying to identify the person who placed 
the suitcase on the flight from malta to frankfurt west germany 
where it was transferred to the pan am jetliner 
the pan am plane flew to london where it became flight 103 it 
exploded en route to new york city 
an insurance investigator hired by the airline said the us 
government learned a bomb had been placed aboard the flight but did 
not tell pan am a cia spokesman has denounced the investigators 
report as outrageous 
investigators are focusing on a possibility the terrorist group 
popular front for the liberation of palestine is responsible for 
the bombing

rajiv gandhi resigned as prime minister 
today having failed to lead his congress party to decisive victory 
in elections for a new parliament 
president ramaswamy venkataraman accepted the resignation but 
asked gandhi and his cabinet to remain in office until a new 
government is appointed the presidential palace announced 
gandhis resignation had been expected and is a formality that 
clears the way for the opposition national front alliance to try to 
form the next government provided venkataraman asks it to do so 
the president normally would ask the party that won the most 
seats to attempt to form a government but the constitution does 
not specifically require this 
gandhi who has served in parliament since 1980 and became prime 
minister in 1984 spent a halfhour with venkataraman and drove 
away from the palace behind the wheel of a silver gray mercedes 
benz he did not stop to speak to reporters 
congress party leaders said tuesday they were ready to enter 
into the secondary role of an opposition party for only the second 
time in indias 42 years of independence 
lawmakers from the national front scheduled a meeting later 
today to choose the man they claim will be the next prime minister 
of the worlds most populous democracy 
the leading candidate was former gandhi ally vishwanath pratap 
singh although he has said repeatedly he does not want to become 
prime minister 
other possible contenders included chandra shekhar one of the 
architects of the movement that ousted gandhis mother and 
predecessor prime minister indira gandhi from power in 1977 
mrs gandhis defeat in elections that year relegated the 
congress party to the role of opposition for 29 months until its 
election comeback in 1980 
national front leaders said they planned to call on venkataraman 
later in the day and tell him they were ready to form a government 
under the indian constitution it is up to the president to 
decide who should be asked to form a government in the past the 
decision was clearcut because the congress party had always won a 
comfortable majority except for 1977 when the janata party 
defeated mrs gandhi 
the situation this time was more confused 
while the congress party and its small party allies had the most 
seats their combined total was far short of the 263 required for a 
majority 
the national front lagged even farther behind but it enlisted 
the postelection tacit support of other opposition groups and 
buoyed its hopes of forming a government 
with 486 of the 525 parliamentary seats decided the congress 
party had 186 and its allies 17 for a total of 203 
the national front has 122 and its allies had 132 for a total 
of 254 
the rest went to small parties and independents 
gandhi was swept into power in december 1984 on a wave of 
sympathy following the assassination of his mother two months 
earlier 
but support for him declined in the face of allegations of 
government corruption gandhi has denied any wrongdoing 
while gandhi was closeted with the president today election 
officials announced that he had been elected to parliament from his 
amethi constituency for the third consecutive time 
he defeated his nearest rival raj mohan gandhi grandson of 
indian independence leader mohandas k mahatma gandhi by 197000 
votes united news of india said 
the news agency did not give the vote totals delayed by a 
partial revote monday after authorities evidence of voter fraud in 
the initial nov 22 voting raj mohan gandhi who is not related to 
rajiv gandhi had charged congress party activists with stuffing 
ballot boxes and resorting to violence 
gandhi who has served in parliament since 1980 and became prime 
minister in 1984 spent a halfhour with venkataraman and drove 
away from the palace behind the wheel of a silver gray mercedes 
benz he did not stop to speak to reporters

a crane plummeted from the 16th story of a 
building under construction tuesday flattening a school van cars 
and smashing into an office building across the street at least 
five people were killed and 21 were injured authorities said 
it felt like an earthquake said merrill lynch vice 
president joe mclaughlin who was in the damaged office building 
i looked out and saw two bodies one construction workers boots 
were sticking up through a mass of jagged metal 
in the aftermath of the accident that rained concrete and 
twisted steel on one of the busiest intersections in the financial 
district a prosecutor said criminal negligence charges twice 
previously had been filed against the projects general contractor 
for accidents on los angeles construction sites 
there were conflicting statements on what was happening before 
the crane fell fire chief fred postel said it was hoisting steel 
beams but the general contractor said the crane was being 
repositioned from the 16th to the 20th floors 
a piece of the crane at least three stories long dangled from 
the side of the building under construction two hours after the 
830 am accident police roped off the area and ambulances rushed 
in and out 
the street was littered with flattened cars and a mangled 
motorcyle gas was cut off to the damaged 21story office building 
for fear of an explosion 
the wreckage looks absolutely incredible steel beams look 
like pickup sticks said acting mayor angela alioto sitting in 
while mayor art agnos tours the country urging tourists to return 
in the wake of the oct 17 earthquake 
at an afternoon news conference at the scene alioto said 
experts could not immediately determine the cause of the collapse 
she also said streets in a foursquareblock area would be closed 
for at least a week for cleanup and repairs and the california 
street cable car also was shut down 
alioto said the dead were four construction workers all from 
the seattle area and the woman driving the school van operated by 
laidlaw transit inc 
its pretty rough said laidlaw senior vice president howard 
wallack they other employees are pretty upset and we are 
arranging a chaplain and psychologist to go over to our offices 
the fire chief said five people were listed as missing in the 
twisted steel and broken concrete however police capt tom murphy 
said later that everyone had been accounted for 
three hospitals reported receiving 21 victims four in serious 
condition most of the rest had minor injuries 
swinerton amp walberg co of san francisco the general contractor 
on the job said the crane was being repositioned from the 16th 
story to the 20th story the second such repositioning of the 
project 
the crane model no sn355 manufactured by american pecco of 
millwood ny had a capacity of 17 tons the site was last 
inspected by the state occupational safety and health 
administration on aug 11 the project which began in january has 
not been cited for safety violations the company said in a news 
release 
criminal negligence charges were twice filed against swinerton 
and walbert in 1981 and 1986 for separate accidents on the los 
angeles sites said los angeles deputy city attorney michael 
guarino 
in 1981 charges were filed after a crane collapsed and an 
unknown number of people were killed guarino said the case was 
dropped because prosecutors could not get the kind of charges they 
wanted to the jury he said 
prosecutors wanted to prove only culpable negligence in the 
case guarino said but the state labor code requires that 
prosecutors prove wanton and willful disregard for human safety he 
said 
in the 1986 case guarino said swinerton and walberg was a 
codefendant in a case stemming from a construction site accident 
that killed three ironworkers after the steel superstructure of a 
21story office building was overloaded 
that case resulted in a civil compromise in which swinerton and 
walberg agreed to sponsor a safety seminar for downtown los angeles 
contractors and to donate an unknown amount to a labor safety 
board guarino said 
according to washington state department of labor and industries 
records the san francisco projects crane subcontractor the 
erection co of kirkland wash was fined for safety violations at 
least four times before 1987 three times in 1987 and once in 1988 
said department spokesman john akins 
the company is appealing the last reported fine which was 
imposed after a worker fell to his death while working on the 
pacific first center in downtown seattle in august 1988 akins said 
attempts to reach adam jones president of the erection co 
were not successful and telephone calls to company offices were not 
returned 
in tuesdays accident debris rained down on a taxi driven by 
issa massarweh who had two passengers at the time the cabs back 
window was smashed 
i dont know where my passengers are he said i threw 
myself under the dashboard he told his passengers to duck and 
when he next looked they had left he was unharmed 
i heard a loud bang and stepped up and saw the tail end of a 
crane said stockbroker don trabert who saw the accident from 
his office in the bank of america building 
it sounded like a chinese new year only twice as loud the 
crane was swinging and dangling in the air and people were 
scrambling away from the scene 
a small fire broke out but was quickly extinguished 
in 198889 the construction site yielded close to 1 million 
artifacts dating to a chinese settlement in the 1800s

peruvians are caught in savage crossfire between 
leftist rebels and government troops who have become equally 
ruthless killing hundreds of people as they try to end the 
insurgency amnesty international said today 
the international human rights group said in a report that the 
peruvian governments attempt to defeat the shining path rebel 
movement has raised the level of ruthless and indiscrimate violence 
torture mutilation disappearance murder and rape have 
become a hallmark of the armed forces campaign against 
terrorism the international organization said in the report on 
human rights in peru 
it said the armed forces have singled out young people as 
suspected supporters of the shining path 
the killing torture and disappearance of hundreds of 
children and young people has been one cost of a strategy of 
terror to fight terror adopted by the armed forces in peru it 
said 
the government must uphold the law and not resort to the terror 
tactics of its enemies amnesty said it called on the government 
to investigate all alleged abuses and bring those responsible to 
justice 
but amnesty also stressed the extensive and continuing 
massacres mutilations and torture by opposition forces such as the 
shining path 
as a result it said peasants in areas where the government has 
declared a state of emergency have been caught between two 
fires victims of massive abuse by both government forces and 
armed opposition 
many people have relatives who have been killed in cold blood 
by both antigovernment guerrillas and government forces the 
group said 
more than 3000 detainees have disappeared in the past seven 
years and at least 3000 more are estimated to have been killed by 
security forces individually or in mass executions the report 
said 
it said targets for human rights abuses by government forces are 
being drawn from increasingly broad sectors of society 
local government officers community leaders trade unionists 
journalists lawyers academics and people considered critics or 
opponents of the government have been threatened killed or had 
their homes and offices bombed amnesty said many killings were 
carried out after the victims had been detained and tortured it 
said 
the report focuses on violations in the emergency zones where 
more than half of perus 21 million people live under 
politicalmilitary command 
in these zones many killings appear to have been carried out to 
punish communities for rebel activities in their areas it said 
amnesty said few males between 14 and 40 remain in these zones 
and women have been subjected to increasing abuse by government 
forces 
rape by troops is widespread and women of all ages are at risk 
amnesty said adding that it knows of no convictions for this crime 
in the emergency zones 
the report said it is common for women to be raped after 
soldiers have entered villages and taken the men away other women 
have been raped while in detention it said 
it cited the case of maria guinarita pisco pisango 26 a farmer 
from san martin de alao in lamas province who was raped tortured 
and killed by soldiers after she reported her husbands 
disappearance in january 1988 
children appear to be most at risk during raids by government 
troops amnesty said 
children and young people are under threat for their real or 
supposed sympathies in the emergency zones the place they live in 
the school they attend or the books they read may result in their 
secret detention torture or murder it said

prime minister rajiv gandhi has dropped 
charges against a newly elected parliament member who is accused of 
masterminding the 1984 assassination of gandhis mother officials 
said today 
simranjit singh mann a member of the sikh religious sect and a 
former police officer was elected to the lower house of parliament 
from the northern state of punjab by an overwhelming majority this 
week 
the order to drop charges against mann was one of the last acts 
as prime minister by gandhi the son and successor of prime 
minister indira gandhi a court must actually order manns release 
but that is considered a formality 
gandhi failed to lead his congress party to a decisive election 
victory this week he tendered his resignation today but is to 
remain in office until a new government is appointed 
he asked home minister buta singh to take steps to withdraw 
the case against mann a ministry spokesman said 
the spokesman who cannot be identified under briefing rules 
said the home ministry is examining the prime ministers 
directions but the release can only be ordered by the relevant 
court 
the shots that killed mrs gandhi on oct 31 1984 were fired 
by two of her sikh bodyguards one of them was shot to death on the 
spot by other bodyguardsthe surviving gunman and a sikh government 
clerk convicted in the plot were hanged in january 
the government said the assassination was masterminded by sikh 
extremists fighting for a separate homeland in the punjab mann 
who has been jailed for the past five years on sedition charges 
was charged with conspiracy when the assassination case was 
reopened in april 
united news of india in a dispatch today quoted gandhi as 
saying i will hold no illwill or rancor i have always striven 
to heal wounds at times i have succeeded sometimes i have been 
disappointed 
if there is any more step that can be taken to bring down the 
curtain on the unfortunate past and to ring in the future that 
step should be taken now the conspiracy case will not heal 
wounds gandhi was quoted as saying 
united news of india and press trust of india said gandhi 
decided to seek manns release because mann had sworn allegiance to 
the constitution 
mann 44 was elected from the tarn taran constituency in 
punjab campaigning from a jail more than 850 miles away in bihar 
state 
mann a senior officer in the prestigious indian police service 
resigned soon after mrs gandhi ordered an army attack on the 
golden temple in amritsar sikhdoms holiest shrine to flush out 
sikh militants entrenched there 
more than 1200 people mostly sikhs were killed in the 1984 
army operation that precipitated the revenge slaying of mrs gandhi 
another sikh charged with conspiracy in the gandhi murder 
attinder pal singh also was elected to parliament while in jail 
there has been no word on whether he too may be freed 
bimal khalsa widow of beant singh the assassin who was killed 
on the spot and his father sucha singh also were elected 
all three belonged to manns akali dal party 
more than 7500 people have died in the 8year campaign for the 
homeland that sikh extremists propose to carve out of punjab a 
farming state bordering pakistan 
sikhs whose religion is rooted in both islam and hinduism 
comprise just 2 percent of indias 880 million people but they 
have a slight majority in punjab

homosexual activists are applauding a state 
judicial panels decision to censure a judge who said he gave a 
lighter sentence to a killer because the two victims were 
queers 
attorneys for district judge jack hampton of dallas said they 
were disappointed that the commission must have succumbed to 
pressure from the media and from uninformed special interest 
groups 
members of the dallas gay alliance say they still want hampton 
to step down 
i believe that its certainly a step in the right direction 
said william waybourn president of the group but judge hampton 
remains on the bench what is to happen now to gay men and lesbians 
who come into his courtroom 
bill nelson an attorney for the alliance said the group 
intends to file a petition with the texas supreme court calling for 
hamptons removal 
the state commission on judicial conduct issued its censure 
tuesday for hampton whose remarks to reporters in december ignited 
a yearlong storm of criticism 
last december hampton said he sentenced richard lee bednarski 
to 30 years in prison instead of life for the slaying of two 
men in a park because the victims were homosexual 
those two gays that got killed wouldnt have been killed if 
they hadnt been cruising the streets picking up teenage boys 
hampton told reporters at the time 
i dont much care for queers cruising the streets picking up 
teenage boys ive got a teenage boy 
the commission said hamptons comments were destructive of 
public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the 
judiciary 
public censure is the strongest action the commission could take 
short of recommending the 57yearold republicans removal from the 
bench 
the commission ruled that hamptons statements violated the code 
of judicial conduct which prohibits judges from making public 
comments on a pending case and requires them to promote public 
confidence in the judiciary 
the hostility and distrust generated by this judges 
irresponsible statements created an additional burden for the 
entire judiciary it said

the jury in the 2yearold mcmartin 
preschool molestation trial returned its first sealed verdict after 
more than three weeks of deliberations but still has 64 counts to 
decide 
the jury also indicated tuesday it was deadlocked on another 
count 
concerned that the longest criminal trial in us history could 
end in a mistrial the judge has taken the unusual step of having 
jurors return verdicts under seal one at a time instead of waiting 
until decisions are made on all counts 
there are no more alternate jurors so if one panel member drops 
out a mistrial would have to be declared on any unresolved charges 
against raymond buckey 31 and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey 
63 
taking them one at a time is an insane process but waiting 
for all of them is just as insane because we may lose a key juror 
before that time and thus lose all of those verdicts superior 
court judge william pounders said tuesday 
pounders said he could find no precedent to support his plan 
but added that circumstances required it 
he planned a meeting with attorneys friday to decide when the 
verdicts should be read but said that if two or more decisions are 
returned by then an announcement could come as early as next week 
the buckeys are charged with conspiracy and child molestation at 
their familyowned manhattan beach preschool the trial has cost 
los angeles county more than 15 million 
buckeys lawyer danny davis objected to the procedure pounders 
set down saying jurors should have the chance to change their 
minds about any count as their talks proceed 
but the judge said im not going to tell them they should 
take sealed verdicts and redecide them 
before returning the sealed verdict the jurors indicated they 
were deadlocked on one count 
theyve said only that theyve taken several ballots and 
cannot reach a verdict on a count pounders said given the 
fact there are 65 counts that is not too significant 
the judge said the jurys questions led him to believe the 
deadlock involves a boy whose mother set off the mcmartin 
investigation six years ago with a complaint that her son had been 
molested 
the mother since has died and the boy did not testify jurors 
had only medical evidence on which to consider the charges 
involving him the defense called that evidence inconclusive

the latest california ballot measure seeks to 
shelter the homeless provide affordable housing improve 
education repair roads and reduce residential property taxes 
theres a catch of course the splitroll property tax 
initiative raise the business property tax from 1 percent to 22 
percent 
the measure has survived an important court challenge and its 
author predicted tuesday it will appear on the ballot either in 
june or november 1990 depending on how fast signatures on the 
petition are verified 
proponents say the measure is needed in large part because 
californias proposition 13 the propertytax slashing measure that 
launched a national tax revolt in 1978 has left state and local 
governments without the money for basic services 
it is sponsored by voter revolt the group whose proposition 103 
was approved by voters last year and is among the nations most 
radical of attempts to control insurance rates 
homeowners have a major incentive to vote for the new measure a 
500 yearly reduction in their residential property tax 
opponents however say most businesses will just pass on their 
extra costs to consumers they say such sweeping changes should be 
enacted by the legislature as a part of a general tax increase 
its a thinly disguised tax increase for every person who 
lives in the state said martyn hopper the state director for 
the national federation of independent businesses one of many 
business groups who oppose the measure 
but the measures author bill zimmerman said it was needed 
precisely because lawmakers have been ineffective 
the only reason we have to bring such a complex initiative to 
the ballot is that we have a paralyzed state legislature that cant 
address the major problems of the state he said 
opponents including the los angeles area chamber of commerce 
and the california farm bureau federation asked the state court of 
appeal to invalidate it arguing it violates californias 
constitutional ban on initiatives dealing with more than one 
subject 
on the one hand it changes property tax methods and on the 
other it creates new social programs relating to the homeless and 
housing said john hodgson a lawyer for the opponents 
but the court in a decision received this week refused to 
review the case hodgson said opponents will appeal to the state 
supreme court but zimmerman said the high court has never 
intervened in such a case 
and tony quinn another official of the national federation of 
independent businesses acknowledged the measure would probably 
make the june ballot 
under the initiative business property would be taxed at 22 
percent instead of the 1 percent now standard in california 
residential property would still be taxed at 1 percent with the 
first 57000 in value exempt compared versus 7000 today homes 
assessed at 1 million or more wouldnt get the increased exemption 
voter revolt says 842119 californians signed the petition by 
october 595485 valid signatures are needed to qualify it for the 
ballot zimmerman said it will appear on either the june or 
november ballot depending on how fast the signatures are verified 
the state legislative analyst estimates the measure would 
generate 79 billion a year when fully operative in 1991 of that 
5 billion would go to homeowners and to increased rentaltax 
credits the rest to state and local governments for affordable 
housing shelter for the homeless better education and repair of 
crumbling roads sewers bridges and the like 
zimmerman said that in the long run such improvements would be 
good for business many businesses already are finding it 
impossible to locate in a state plagued with astronomical housing 
costs clogged roads mediocre schools and infrastructure problems 
business will be more profitable if we solve problems of law 
enforcement zoning streets education and housing he said 
all of that has an impact on the longterm business prospects

space shuttle discovery 
sustained little damage to its heat shield tiles and had few other 
problems during its fiveday military mission a nasa official said 
the basic orbiter system itself looks like its just maturing 
as everybody promised it would and i think the hardware is starting 
to prove itself said tip talone discoverys overseer between 
flights 
discovery was on schedule to begin a twoday flight back to 
kennedy space center atop a jumbo jet saturday talone said tuesday 
talone said he tried to avoid the cliche of reporting that 
discovery had come back as the best and cleanest one yet but 
it really is 
initial inspection indicated fewer than 10 thermal tiles would 
need replacement because of damage 
the tiles are typically damaged by debris hits during launch and 
landing 
discovery landed monday on a concrete runway rather than a clay 
runway on edwards dry lakebed which reduces the amount of debris 
kicked up by the tires 
talone also said the brakes were in good condition and the right 
side tires had more wear than the others but that was not 
considered worrisome 
the amount of damage to an orbiter determines how long it will 
take to make it ready for its next flight and affects the schedule 
for facilities shared by all the orbiters at kennedy space center 
in florida 
at cape canaveral fla the space shuttle columbia was 
transported to a refurbished launch pad tuesday for a christmastime 
mission to deploy one satellite and retrieve another the size of a 
bus before it falls to earth 
discoverys next mission is to carry the hubble space telescope 
into orbit in late march 
the bottom line is we think that weve got a really good start 
to get the hubble out talone said 
discoverys toilet broke and had to be fixed by the crew but 
few other problems showed up during the mission 
the inflight anomaly list was extremely clean talone said 
its five astronauts reportedly achieved their main goal on 
thursday by releasing a 300 million spy satellite but there was 
no confirmation of the missions purpose because of defense 
departmentmandated secrecy

former national security adviser john m 
poindexter facing trial in the irancontra case has begun a 
fundraising drive to pay for his legal fees according to a 
published report today 
poindexter wrote a fourpage letter saying liberal special 
interests want him silenced bankrupt or imprisoned the new 
york times reported 
he said that after having put five sons through college on a 
navy salary he cannot meet his expenses alone 
there is only one reason why i am being put through this 
ordeal political revenge wrote poindexter who describes 
himself as one man alone against the massive onslaught of 
liberal special interests who want to imprison me for serving my 
country 
he went on the liberals in congress wanted to destroy the 
reagan presidency any way they could when they found that they 
were going to be unsuccessful they turned on me 
poindexter faces five criminal charges in a trial scheduled to 
begin jan 22 the charges include conspiring to obstruct 
congressional inquiries in august 1986 about whether national 
security council aide oliver l north was making false statements 
to congress and secretly helping to arm the contras 
poindexters lawyer richard w beckler called the former 
admirals legal fees substantial but would not disclose how 
much they were some of those involved in the fundraising appeal 
suggested the fees would be 3 million to 4 million the times 
said 
poindexter was unavailable for comment the newspaper said 
poindexter wrote he has always done what i thought was in the 
best longterm interests of the country but because i care 
more about the longterm security of america than i do about 
myself i must now face the liberals accusations surrounding the 
irancontra affair 
retired adm clarence a hill jr one of three retired admirals 
who set up a defense fund for poindexter said they were concerned 
his legal fees would be about the same as norths but he would not 
attract as many contributors as the former marine 
the other two former admirals are james l holloway iii and 
gerald e miller 
the letter asks for contributions of 35 50 100 and 500 
hill would not say how much money the drive has raised

despite the reforms sweeping the east 
bloc nato defense ministers agreed today to refrain from 
unilateral reductions in conventional arms until a formal agreement 
with the warsaw pact can be reached 
the ministers ending two days of talks said in a statement 
that they welcomed the changes in the east but issued a word of 
caution 
there has unquestionably been a change in the nature of the 
threat which confronts us but not yet a significant change in the 
military capability of the soviet union and the warsaw pact nato 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner said 
us defense secretary dick cheney said the united states will 
not bring home any troops from europe without first consulting nato 
allies 
we will not act unilaterally he said referring to a 
pentagon study of troop cuts in the early 1990s that would exceed 
those now being negotiated at eastwest conventional arms talks in 
vienna 
in their statement the ministers noted the start of unilateral 
reductions in conventional or nonnuclear arms by the sovietled 
warsaw pact 
but they insisted we cannot ignore the fact that even after 
completion of these reductions the warsaw pact will retain 
wellequipped forces which substantially outnumber those of the 
west 
as a result the statement said the ministers would take a 
pragmatic stepbystep approach to changes in the east where 
hungary poland east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia have 
embraced democratic reform to varying degrees 
the ministers also renewed their determination not to make any 
unilateral reductions that could risk undermining the prospect of 
reaching a conventional arms accord 
the 16 nations of the north atlantic treaty organization and 
seven warsaw pact members are currently negotiating cuts in 
nonnuclear arms and troops in vienna austria 
in those talks washington wants the soviet union and the united 
states cut their forces in europe to 275000 soldiers each that 
would mean a cutback of 300000 soviet and 30000 american troops

ethiopian government and eritrean rebel 
negotiators shook hands today on an agreement to hold formal peace 
talks then came out fighting in a display that bodes ill for 
future negotiations 
at a news conference ending nearly three weeks of preliminary 
talks the two sides disagreed on the exact meaning of their 
agreement and accused each other of footdragging and 
misrepresentations 
a weary former president jimmy carter who mediated the 
negotiations sat between the ethiopian and eritrean 
representatives as they exchanged accusations and commented ive 
heard this kind of talk for 20 days 
but carter while cautioning that he was not naive enough to 
predict certain success said he was more optimistic than i 
have been at any time that the sides could find an end the 
28yearold war between the government and eritreans fighting to 
create a separate homeland in the north 
the preliminary negotiations which began in atlanta in 
september and resumed in nairobi on nov 20 ended with no 
agreement on a date or place for the main peace talks 
they also ended with the eritreans accusing ethiopias marxist 
government of obstructing the talks and contesting carters 
statement that the united nations had declined to act as an 
observer in further talks 
during the atlanta and nairobi talks in general and last week 
in particular the ethiopian regime some of its allies and certain 
individuals have resorted to lies blackmail and sinister 
manipulations to obstruct the participation of the un as an 
observer said alamin mohamed saiyed the chief eritrean 
negotiator 
alamin insisted that the united nations had not rejected an 
invitation to act as an observer in the main talks although carter 
said secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar had turned down the 
offer in a telephone conversation friday 
alamin also took issue with an informal comment by carter 
following his reading of the closing communique the former 
president said observers chosen for the main talks shall witness 
all negotiating sessions without directly participating in the 
discussions 
the eritrean negotiator said mediation cannot be limited to 
the cochairmen and noted that the role of observers was not 
spelled out in the joint communique carter conceded that there 
is some disagreement about the role to be played by observers 
alamin also said the government delegation had refused to 
discuss a drought in northern ethiopia that he said threatens 15 
million people with starvation in eritrea alone 
the united nations has estimated that up to 4 million people 
risk starvation in eritrea and three other northern ethiopian 
provinces tigre wollo and gonder the government has disputed 
that forecast 
the eritrean rebels took up arms against the government in 1961 
in an attempt to gain independence for ethiopias northernmost 
province a former italian colony that was federated with ethiopia 
under a un mandate in 1952 
the war and associated famines are estimated to have claimed 
more than 1 million lives

sovietbloc forces would need so much 
preparation to attack western europe that us intelligence would 
detect the activity months in advance according to a report 
published today 
the intelligence community believes we would have some 33 to 
44 days of warning time and possibly six months the washington 
post said in todays editions quoting a study prepared for defense 
secretary dick cheney 
nato war plans had been based on the assumption that the west 
would have only 10 to 14 days warning the newspaper said a short 
expected warning time led to decisions to invest large sums in 
airlift capability and forward storage of ammunition and supplies 
the study said that while it remained possible for the soviets 
to launch a quick attack that would allow the west less than two 
weeks warning such a move would be quite risky for the 
soviets 
the study also found that during the 1968 warsaw pact invasion 
of czechoslovakia moscow was so worried about possible 
intervention from the west that it put its battlefield nuclear 
rockets on 10minute alert even though moscow clearly wanted to 
avoid a general war in europe 
in brussels belgium today cheney told reporters i havent 
seen any such planning document that doesnt necessarily mean 
there isnt one occasionally i receive documents after they 
arrive at the new york times the washington post

senior cabinet ministers today 
studied an official report about alleged police death squads and 
the state radio urged a public inquiry to erase any doubts about a 
possible coverup 
neither justice minister kobie coetsee nor law and order 
minister adriaan vlok commented publicly on the contents of the 
report 
it was completed tuesday by a provincial attorney general and a 
police commander after a fiveweek investigation of claims by three 
former policemen that they served in death squads which 
assassinated government opponents 
vlok and coetsee were expected to forward the report to 
president de klerk promptly so he could determine what further 
steps should be taken 
new allegations about death squad activity were made in the 
netherlands on tuesday by a 27yearold south african who 
identified himself as mervyn malan and said he was a cousin of 
south africas defense minister gen magnus malan 
the general said today that he had no knowledge of a relative 
named mervyn but the defense ministry said it was not ready to 
comment on the mans allegations that his former army unit had 
carried out attacks on civilians 
the south african broadcasting corp which closely reflects 
government thinking said today that the very idea of a police 
assassination squad operating in south africa is so monstrous as to 
be almost unbelievable 
it is absolutely essential that the facts are established 
in a manner that leaves no room for doubt that justice had been 
done the commentary said unless justice is not only done but 
seen to be done those allegations will be believed and exploited 
for propaganda in quarters hostile to south africa 
de klerk in a speech to a police parade tuesday said strong 
action would be taken against any officers implicated in death 
squad activity he said most police officers behaved in an 
impeccable manner and did not deserve to be dragged through the 
mud 
de klerk also announced major steps to reduce the influence of 
military and police officials over national security policy 
he abolished the controversial national security management 
system established under former president pw botha to coordinate 
a counterrevolutionary strategy that included suppression of 
activists and upgrading of black communities 
several newspapers suggested today that abolition of the 
security system was a prelude to partial or total lifting of the 
state of emergency declared by botha in june 1986 
the system was dominated by security force officers and reported 
directly to the powerful state security council consisting of 
generals police commanders and selected cabinet ministers 
critics said the system usurped the powers of parliament and 
municipal governments while setting policies on the international 
national and local level

violence has claimed at least a dozen lives this week including 
three men killed by police 
scores of homes have been burned and numerous street battles 
have occurred in mpumalanga near the provincial capital 
pietermaritzburg the violence has included clashes between rival 
black factions and a wave of attacks on police 
mpumalanga has been the center of an upsurge of political 
violence throughout natal more than 30 people have been killed in 
unrest in the province this week according to police one of the 
bloodiest periods during a threeyear power struggle in which more 
than 3000 blacks have died 
the conflict is between members of inkatha a relatively 
conservative zulu political organization headed by mangosuthu 
buthelezi and supporters of the banned united democratic front a 
militant antiapartheid coalition 
maj gen jc van niekerk police commissioner for natal said 
today that additional security forces would sent into mpumalanga

reinforcements would include army units 
police headquarters said six people were killed in mpumalanga in 
the 24hour period ending at daybreak today these included three 
men shot and killed by police who were fired on after arriving to 
break up a clash in which two other men had been killed 
five other unrest deaths were reported in the same period 
elsewhere in natal 
police officials have insisted their forces seek to remain 
neutral in the factional conflict however a delegation of lawyers 
and human rights activists which visited mpumalanga on tuesday 
contended that police were assisting inkatha vigilantes 
both inkatha and the united democratic front oppose apartheid 
but they differ sharply over strategy 
buthelezi condemns the fronts use of boycotts and encouragement 
of economic sanctions against south africa he also opposes the 
guerrilla tactics of the outlawed african national congress which 
is aligned with the front 
some united democratic front leaders depict buthelezi as a 
government collaborator because of his position as chief minister 
of the tribal homeland of kwazulu

east germanys statecontrolled newspapers 
today joined communist leaders and some dissidents in rejecting 
west german chancellor helmut kohls call for eventual german 
reunification 
what does bonn want anschluss or real partnership asked 
the junge welt newspaper in a headline anschluss is the german 
word for annexation and is used to describe the nazi takeover of 
austria in 1938 
after kohl made his proposal on tuesday communist party leader 
egon krenz said reunification could conjure fears of a naziera 
germany and i know no one in the world who would like such a 
germany but krenz welcomed kohls call for closer cooperation 
between the germanys 
many europeans worry that with its economic and political might 
a reunited germany of 80 million people would dominate the 
continent germany was divided into two states after the nazi 
defeat in world war ii 
the prospect of reunification seemed distant less than a month 
ago but sweeping changes in east germany have revived the idea 
with east germans disillusioned with communist rule fleeing in 
droves and taking to the streets bythe hundreds of thousands the 
party leadership ousted hardliner erich honecker last month and 
launched a radical program of reforms with the promise of free 
elections 
the opening of the countrys borders on nov 9 gave east germans 
unrestricted freedom to travel to west germany for the first time 
since the berlin wall was built in 1961 
some people in both countries have called for reunification an 
idea consistently rejected by east germanys leaders 
krenz emphasized the need for two sovereign independent 
german states 
a unity of germany isnt on the agenda he told west 
germanys ard television network 
however he did not rule out a confederation or partnership 
between the two germanys that kohl promoted krenz said talk of 
such an arrangement requires more time 
wolfgang meyer the east german government spokesman said 
kohls proposal for eventual reunification went beyond realities 
and could easily lead to irritation by not observing the 
sovereignty and independence of the two german states 
in a statement carried by the official news agency adn meyer 
also said kohls proposals for cooperation contained interesting 
starting points for negotiations 
a group of leading east german intellectuals also rejected 
reunification and expressed fear of their country being 
pocketed by west germany they said east germany should remain a 
separate socialist state 
the dissidents including prominent authors stefan heym and 
christa wolf started a petition drive tuesday calling for a 
national vote of confidence in socialism 
adn said today that krenz had signed a petition and told the 
dissidents in a letter we have the historic duty to preserve 
this country with its antifascist ideals and traditions as a 
socialist alternative within german development 
in his speech to parliament on tuesday kohl sought to allay 
fears about a reunited germany saying the germans will be a 
dividend for a europe that is coming together and never again a 
threat 
he did not offer a timetable and made it clear it could take 
years to form a federation kohl said german reunification can only 
occur as the overall eastwest division of europe is overcome 
kohl proposed creation of joint governmental and parliamentary 
committees whose purpose would be permanent consultation 
between the two germanys on economic environmental cultural and 
scientific matters 
in other developments tuesday adn outlined a new travel 
proposal that is aimed at controlling some of the economic damage 
east germany faces by having an open border with its richer 
neighbor 
since east germany opened the borders illegal currency trading 
has intensified and blackmarket dealings have been rampant 
under the proposal east germans can have their passports 
revoked if they are found to be working abroad or earning any 
income without the consent of the east german government 
every citizen of east germany has the right to travel abroad 
any time and to obtain a passport for this purpose states the 
proposed law that will be discussed at a parliamentary session 
beginning friday 
the government last week imposed new customs controls aimed at 
intercepting huge stashes of currency or subsidized consumer goods 
headed west in the bags of east german travelers 
in the first publication of official figures the communist 
party newspaper neues deutschland said today that 34 million 
people had left east germany during 40 years of communist rule 
west german estimates say the number is far higher east germanys 
current population is about 165 million

the newspaper of the roman catholic 
diocese of providence has told politicians that if they want to 
advertise holiday greetings theyll have to sign a declaration 
supporting a constitutional amendment against abortion 
so far politicians are refusing to sign a spokesman for one 
warwick mayor francis x flaherty a democrat considering a run for 
governor said he was offended despite his antiabortion stance 
rhode island politicians traditionally buy christmas greetings 
ads in the providence visitor 
the paper previously has barred campaign ads from prochoice 
politicians but in a recent letter told officeholders and office 
seekers that congratulatory ads and holiday greetings also would be 
rejected unless the politicians signed the declaration 
the providence visitor holds the view that abortion 
constitutes the greatest single outrage being waged against 
humanity in america today the letter said 
the policy was decided on at a meeting last month of the 
visitors board of directors said the rev john w hunt the 
newspapers executive director 
the publisher bishop louis e gelineau did not attend but 
supports the decision hunt said 
gelineau recently chastised rep claudine schneider rri for 
her view that a womans decision whether to have an abortion is her 
own although schneider personally opposes abortion 
circulation figures were not immediately available for the 
weekly paper but it is an influental publication in a state where 
the population is twothirds catholic 
hunt said the paper could lose as much as 5000 in revenue a 
year he would not identify the politicians to whom the letters 
were sent but said no forms had been returned dec 15 is the 
deadline for the christmas ads 
among those who have refused to sign are johnston mayor ralph 
russo and cranston mayor michael a traficante both of whom oppose 
abortion 
i dont think its fair said russo im an administrator 
i dont set laws

a 21monthold girl who received the nations 
first livingdonor liver transplant was recovering today after a 
complication and her father hoped to have her home for christmas 
alyssa smith underwent a second operation tuesday to stop 
internal bleeding detected 12 hours after she received a piece of 
her mothers liver she was in critical but stable condition at 
university of chicago medical center this morning 
she was very stable through the night hospital spokesman 
john easton said she rested comfortably 
shes looking much better her father john l smith said 
tuesday 
even with the surgery and everything she looked great he 
said his voice trembling her eyes were kind of open and she saw 
me and her face kind of lit up a bit 
doctors removed the left lobe of 29yearold teresa smiths 
liver for the transplant mrs smith was in fair condition today 
she was moved out of intensive care and was expected to be released 
in about a week doctors said 
john smith said the sudden return to the operating room caused 
some tense moments for him and his wife 
it really scared me when they came up and told me the doctor 
of the hospital wanted to talk to me he said 
in the smiths hometown of schertz texas a suburb of san 
antonio the girls grandfather dc morgan also felt 
apprehension as he awaited updates from his wife ada who had 
traveled to chicago 
as youre waiting thoughts can go through your mind he 
said some thoughts are good some are bad 
the surface of alyssas new liver about the size of a mans 
fist had begun to bleed a complication that occurs in about 30 
percent of all liver transplants and she was returned to the 
operating room about 440 am tuesday said dr peter whitington 
the hospitals director of pediatric transplant services 
doctors corrected the problem in a few minutes but kept her in 
surgery for nearly five hours for observation said dr christoph 
broelsch who headed the surgical team 
alyssa may undergo another exploratory operation within a few 
days to examine the liver doctors said but john smith was looking 
further ahead 
the only plans we really have are to have a christmas at 
home with our kids get back to our jobs and get on with our 
lives the father said with this liver she can live the rest 
of her life 
her whole future is ahead of her now 
after the second operation alyssa was awake active and moving 
around although she remained on sedation and a ventilator 
broelsch said 
the transplant is definitely functioning and for now things 
are back on a smooth course he said 
alyssa suffered from an oftenfatal liver disorder called 
biliary atresia the leading cause for liver transplants involving 
children she had been waiting more than a year for a cadaver 
transplant when her parents asked to participate in the hospitals 
livingdonor program 
the procedure was complicated when mrs smiths spleen was 
damaged and had to be removed but doctors predicted she would 
recover fully 
liver transplants from living donors have been performed only 
three times in brazil australia and japan all have been done in 
emergency situations and at least one child has died

the legislature today passed a motion urging 
the forced return of vietnamese refugees and several lawmakers 
condemned us opposition to the idea 
the legislative council vote reflected the strong local 
sentiment to rid this british colony of the nearly 57000 
vietnamese languishing in squalid detention centers after fleeing 
their communist homeland by boat 
mandatory repatriation is a must and it should have been 
implemented yesterday lawmaker rita fan said during the debate 
the measure was merely a resolution urging that great britain 
secure an agreement for repatriation with vietnam britain is 
responsible for the negotiations 
vietnams official news agency said today that vietnam continues 
to reject forced repatriation but will work toward reaching a 
settlement on the basis of respect for the humanitarian spirit 
the nearly 12000 vietnamese in hong kong camps who arrived 
before june 1988 automatically received refugee status and will be 
resettled overseas 
but under a tough new policy the more than 44000 boat people 
who sailed into the colony later are considered illegal immigrants 
subject to repatriation against their will unless they can prove 
they fled political or religious persecution 
of the nearly 7000 screened only 687 have been granted refugee 
status 
the united states has been among the most vocal opponents of 
forced repatriation saying conditions must first improve in 
vietnam 
some lawmakers attributed washingtons position to a guilty 
conscience a reference to the us role in the vietnam war 
they also argued that us economic sanctions were preventing 
vietnam from escaping poverty thereby contributing to the stream 
of vietnamese fleeing to seek a better life abroad 
there is no reason for the united states to oppose mandatory 
repatriation of vietnamese illegal immigrants when they are 
practicing this every day at the usmexican border lawmaker 
allen lee argued 
boat people already have staged hunger strikes and 
demonstrations in their detention centers to protest forced 
repatriation 
the legislative council motion was overwhelmingly approved by 
voice vote

prime minister rajiv gandhi resigned 
today after five years in power clearing the way for opposition 
leaders to try to form a government 
gandhi smiling and looking relaxed said he was ready for the 
role of opposition leader 
absolutely he said we will be a very good watchdog 
the opposition national fronts newly elected parliament members 
planned to meet friday to pick the man they hope will replace 
gandhi as prime minister 
the meeting had been scheduled for today was postponed until 
thursday and then friday amid reported disagreements over who 
should be nominated 
gandhi and his congress party have been gambling that the 
national front would be hamstrung by internal squabbling that would 
pave the way for congress to return to power the congress party 
today decided not to stake a claim to form the government 
former defense and finance minister vishwanath pratap singh is 
the bestknown leader of the national front the fiveparty 
alliance that deprived gandhi of a decisive majority in the new 
parliament in the nov 2226 elections 
but the mildmannered singh 58 has said he does not want to be 
prime minister and is content being the president of the janata 
dal or peoples party the major component of the national front 
another prominent janata dal member chandra shekhar said 
tuesday he was ready to take the prime ministers job but some of 
his national front colleagues were not enthusiastic about his 
candidacy 
there will be trouble in the party if vp singh is not 
elected prime minister efforts to persuade him to contest are 
continuing said jaipal reddy one of the janata dals general 
secretaries 
as of now there is only one candidate reddy said 
despite persuasion vp singh is not a candidate and despite 
dissuasion chandra shekhar remains one 
chandra shekhar 62 was a chief architect of the 1977 janata 
party election triumph that ousted gandhis mother and predecessor 
prime minister indira gandhi from power for 29 months until her 
comeback in 1980 most janata party members switched to the janata 
dal which was formed in 1988 
the 1977 election was the only time in indias 42 years of 
independence that the congress party failed to win a majority in a 
parliamentary election 
this year congress got more seats than any other party but fell 
far short of the majority needed for a government 
the national front got the secondhighest number yet was able to 
muster the tacit support of other opposition parties prompting it 
to boast it would be capable of forming a government 
with 500 of the 525 parliamentary seats decided the congress 
party had 190 and its smallparty allies 17 for a total of 207 
the national front had 130 and its allies had 132 for a total 
of 262 
it takes 263 seats for a majority in the parliament which is to 
convene with 525 elected seats another 18 seats are to be filled 
in elections that have been postponed indefinitely 
the rest of the seats contested this month went to small parties 
and independents most of whom have not declared their support for 
either the congress party or the national front 
gandhi whose lackluster election showing followed charges that 
his government had tolerated corruption and ineptitude at high 
levels will remain prime minister until a new one is accepted by 
president ramaswamy venkataraman 
the 45yearold former airline pilot submitted his resignation 
to venkataraman this morning the president accepted but asked 
gandhi and his cabinet to remain in office until a new government 
is appointed the presidential palace announced 
gandhis resignation had been expected and was a formality that 
cleared the way for the national front to try to form the next 
government provided venkataraman asks it to do so 
the constitution says it is up to the president to decide who 
should be asked to form a government in the past the decision was 
clearcut because one party always won a comfortable majority 
this time the president is free to go to the party he considers 
the most capable of forming a government 
congress party leaders said tuesday they were ready to enter 
into the secondary role of an opposition party and bide their time 
for a return to power 
while gandhi was closeted with the president election officials 
announced he had been elected to parliament from his amethi 
constituency for the third consecutive time 
he defeated his nearest rival raj mohan gandhi grandson of 
indian independence leader mohandas k gandhi by 197000 votes

administration sources say president bush will 
nominate former new york state sen john r dunne to the top civil 
rights post in the justice department bushs spokesman 
acknowledged that dunne is the top candidate 
dunne 59 belongs to the allmale garden city golf club on long 
island but has said he would resign if nominated as assistant 
attorney general for civil rights 
bush earlier nominated william lucas a black from detroit who 
served as sheriff and county executive lucas nomination was 
blocked after a bruising confirmation fight on a tievote in the 
senate judiciary committee on aug 1 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said today that 
dunne is the top candidate and well announce it when we 
announce it 
he declined to talk about dunnes qualifications for the civil 
rights post saying we havent made a selection yet 
the civil rights job occupied by william bradford reynolds 
during the reagan administration has been vacant all year 
reynolds stirred controversy with his forceful opposition to 
programs relying on racial preferences 
on tuesday bush signed legislation extending the life of the 
us commission on civil rights through sept 30 1991 the panel 
shrouded in controversy during the reagan years had been facing 
extinction 
dunne is credited with helping reform the new yorks prison 
system after the deadly riot at attica prison in 1971 he went to 
attica and was critical of gov nelson rockefellers handling of 
the riot 
thirtynine attica inmates and guards were killed when 
rockefeller sent in heavily armed state police to retake the 
prison a guard and three inmates were also killed during the 
uprising 
the sources who insisted on anonymity said dunne was 
undergoing a background clearance check before the white house 
formally announces the nomination that check could take up to two 
months 
dunne a graduate of georgetown university and yale law school 
resigned from the new york senate in september after a 24year 
career in which he rose to deputy majority leader he returned to 
practice law in uniondale ny after losing a race for majority 
leader in the republicancontrolled senate 
a secretary who answered the telephone at dunnes office said 
the senator has no comments and is referring all calls to the 
people in washington 
if the president has to pick a republican he couldnt pick a 
more decent person than john dunne said rep charles rangel 
dny an old friend of dunnes 
rangel said dunne has the legal experience and training that 
the previous candidate lacked 
during most of his 24 years in the legislature a parttime 
post dunne lived at albanys fort orange club which admitted 
women to membership only last year 
dunne told newsday in an interview last week that he would 
resign his membership in the allmale garden city golf club if 
nominated to the justice post 
it would send the wrong message to stay he said it would 
be inappropriate

a united nations group today ignored us threats to 
cut its funds and voted overwhelmingly to help the palestine 
liberation organization teach palestinians how to grow food in 
israelioccupied territories 
only the united states and israel voted against the resolution 
which was introduced by a group of arab countries at the un food 
and agriculture organizations governing conference 
ninetysix countries voted in favor and 14 abstained 
earlier this week the state department threatened to cut funds 
to the agency if the measure passed 
gerald monroe the us representative to the organization 
demanded a roll call vote and told the conference it should not 
allow this precedent by presenting highly political issues 
if that occurs the fao will cease to be effective 
an israeli delegate said his country supported giving technical 
assistance to the arabs in the occupied territories but why does 
it have to be in collaboration with the plo a very political 
organization 
a plo representative said we were trying to depict reality in 
the occupied territories i do not wish to talk about 
politics 
the resolution expresses opposition to the israeli 
confiscation of palestinian land and expropriation of palestinian 
water resources 
it calls on the food organization to provide the palestinian 
people with the assistance necessary for their economic development 
in close cooperation with the palestine liberation organization 
the assistance could include such things as studies of soil 
water and food storage as well as suggestions on how to improve 
foodgrowing skills 
the resolution also asks that the agency include 
israelioccupied territories in future programs and in line with 
the present cooperation and coordination between the palestine 
liberation organization and other un agencies 
the resolution also calls for free access by un staff members 
to occupied palestinian territory 
the state department said tuesday that agriculture secretary 
clayton yeutter had written to the fao directorgeneral eduoard 
saouma a lebanese to say that there was considerable concern over 
the issue in congress and the administration 
the united states said it had no objection to the fao becoming 
involved in projects in the territories but it would be 
illadvised for the organization to do so in such a way as to 
involve itself in the geopolitical process 
this week arab nations plan to push a resolution through the 
un general assembly recognizing the plo as a nation the state 
department has threatened to cut off all us support for the 
united nations if the plan winds approval 
the united states as in other un agencies is assessed 25 
percent of the food organization budget set last week at 5688 
million for the next two years

dry desert winds howling through southern 
california pushed flames across acres of brush and downed power 
lines cutting electricity to thousands 
its blowing like mad said highway patrol officer dale 
clark in san bernardino the santa anas are back with us again 
the santa ana winds reached 70 mph and accompanied regular winds 
of 35 mph overnight at the rialto airport in san bernardino county 
the national weather service said 
nearby in the cajon pass wind ranged from 40 mph to 60 mph 
forcing trucks campers and vans to stop on the shoulder of 
interstate 15 and wait for gusts to lessen the highway patrol 
said part of the interstate was all but closed tuesday morning as 
dirt and sand kicked up by the wind reduced visibility to almost 
zero 
the weather station in sandberg about 60 miles northwest of 
downtown los angeles reported steady winds of 30 to 35 mph tuesday 
night with gusts to 45 mph 
earlier tuesday winds fanned a brush fire in northern san diego 
county that blackened more than 3000 acres destroyed several 
structures and forced the evacuation of schools and homes 
the blaze was 60 percent contained today and residents were 
allowed back in their homes authorities said 
about 50 homes at the el toro marine corps air station were 
evacuated when a fire in a manure pile near the stations horse 
stables ignited and was fanned by high winds said base spokesman 
lt gene browne 
no one was hurt and no structures burned in the early morning 
blaze residents were allowed back into their homes within two 
hours 
power outages caused by wind affected 40000 customers in san 
bernardino orange and ventura counties power was restored to all 
but a few users by tuesday afternoon about 5000 los angeles 
customers also were blacked out tuesday 
jerry steiger a national weather service meteorologist said 
the winds were expected to decrease today as a high pressure system 
over utah weakens 
santa ana winds typically are caused when a highpressure system 
forms over the northern rocky mountain states while a lowpressure 
system hovers over baja california 
air rushing across the western deserts from high to low pressure 
heats up and dries out and then roars through mountain passes 
around the los angeles basin

tankled syrian forces took up combat 
positions facing troops of gen michel aoun in and around beirut 
today in apparent preparation for an attack to drive him from the 
presidential palace 
aoun has refused to cede the palace to the countrys newly 
elected president who fired aoun on tuesday as christian army 
commander 
the general ordered his 20000 soldiers on maximum alert and 
fortified his defenses around the 310squaremile christian enclave 
samir geagea commander of the lebanese forces coalition of 
christian militias declared support for aoun and said his 6000 
fighters would defend the christian areas to the last minute of 
our lives 
aoun does not recognize president elias hrawi a maronite 
catholic like himself and pledges to keep up his efforts to drive 
syrian troops from lebanon syria the main powerbroker in lebanon 
supports hrawi 
thirty rightwing french parliamentarians arrived in the 
christian enclave today and met with aoun at the presidential 
palace 
aouns television said the lawmakers relayed to the general 
the support of the french people for his steadfastness and joined 
an estimated 15000 youths in a sitin around the palace in support 
of the general 
lebanon gained independence from france in 1943 
in an interview with the french radio station europe 1 aoun 
said he was willing to reach a compromise with the syrians 
i invite france to undertake negotiations toward an end that 
safeguards the minimum fundamental rights of the lebanese 
people he said 
aoun has repeatedly offered to negotiate with syria for the 
withdrawal of all of its forces from lebanon the syrians have 
rejected the offers 
france has recognized hrawis government and the nations 
foreign ministry said paris will not be on the side of those who 
would assume the responsibility of again taking up violence 
moslem and christian military sources said the syrians deployed 
t55 tanks in beirut and t62 tanks in the mountainous fronts 
dozens of sovietdesigned t55 tanks rolled into the slums of 
south beirut tuesday night taking up combat positions opposite 
aouns forces said one military source speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
residents of south beirut speaking on condition of anonymity 
said fighters of the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god 
withdrew from the various positions thay had manned along the front 
line in that sector 
hundreds of syrian soldiers moved in the front in south 
beirut is now fully controlled by the syrians said one resident 
the syrians according to military sources also deployed 
mortars and recoilless cannons in south beirut in addition to 
howitzers and multibarreled rocket launchers in the mountains 
overlooking the city 
its a significant buildup the kind of measures that precede 
a major battle one military source said 
the sources said the syrian tanks were in combat formation it 
seems they are only waiting for the orders 
he said aouns forces have planted thousands of antiarmor and 
antipersonnel mines in the valleys separating the christian 
enclave from the syrian positions 
mines have been planted on all the bridges and narrow mountain 
roads linking the christian enclave with the rest of lebanon the 
source added 
aouns forces also have deployed scores of antiaircraft 
batteries around strategic locations to confront a possible landing 
of airborne forces 
syria on tuesday poured at least 15000 troops into lebanon 
backed by artillery tanks and rocket launchers 
hrawi on tuesday fired aoun and replaced him with adm emile 
lahoud also a maronite who called on soldiers following aoun to 
join the new command 
aoun called lahoud a deserter and vowed to fight to the death 
the rebellious 54yearold general refused to relinquish the 
presidential palace 
aouns mainly christian forces battled the syrians for six 
months before the artillery duels ended sept 22 with an arab 
leaguebrokered ceasefire 
he rejects a peace accord approved by parliament last month that 
provided for greater moslem participation in the government because 
it did not set a timetable for withdrawal of the 40000 syrian 
troops in the country 
civil war broke out in lebanon in 1975 the syrian forces 
entered lebanon in 1976 under an arab league peacekeeping mandate 
then sided with the moslems in the war which has claimed 150000 
lives 
before the peace plan was adopted aoun and moslem prime 
minister salim hoss had led competing christian and moslem 
governments for 14 months

us ambassador thomas r pickering says 
the dialogue between the united states and plo will be jeopardized 
if the general assembly recognizes the palestine liberation 
organization as a nation 
debate on the palestinian problem opens today in the general 
assembly where arab nations planned to introduce a resolution 
thursday that would raise the plos status from an observer 
organization to a nonvoting nation like north and south korea 
monaco the vatican san marino and switzerland 
the state department has threatened to cut off all us funds 
for the united nations if the general assembly approves the step 
the united states is assessed 216 million annually onefourth of 
the un budget 
pickering said tuesday that the plo move has serious 
consequences for the peace process in the middle east our ongoing 
dialogue with the plo a lot of very important issues issues that 
i would say should be much more important to the plo than the mere 
change on a nameplate here in the united nations 
in rome today the un food and agriculture organization 
ignored american objections and voted overwhelmingly to help the 
plo teach palestinians how to grow food in israelioccupied 
territories the united states has threatened to cut funds to the 
organization if the measure passed 
since plo leader yasser arafat renounced terrorism last year 
the united states has held talks with plo representatives in tunis 
tunisia 
arab league ambassador clovis maksoud said the arab group was 
determined to go ahead with the move to change the plos status in 
the united nations but that negotiations would continue with other 
un members 
pickering rejected any compromise saying we are clearly not 
interested in exploring all the alternatives 
we are interested in finding a way to end this particular 
silly idea that the palestinians can be declared a state here in 
the united nations when they have none of the attributes of a 
state 
european and nordic diplomats who often play a buffer role in 
the recurring usplo confrontations worked on a compromise prior 
to the showdown vote friday but said privately they had little 
hope 
upgrading the plos status would take a simple majority vote of 
the 159 general assembly members as a member of the 102member 
nonaligned movement the plo has more than enough votes to prevail 
last year the plo declared the existence of a state of 
palestine in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip and the 
plo says 117 nations have recognized it 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said the united states 
is obligated to pay its un dues even if the plo is recognized as 
palestine 
he rejected the us threat of nonpayment and commented 
sometimes i think i have the impression that the americans think 
that theyre making a loan the americans ought to pay what they 
owe 
israel americas firmest ally in the middle east calls the plo 
a terrorist organization and refuses to negotiate with it

a nightmarish thanksgiving trip of two suburban 
peewee football teams turned more bizarre with word that a team bus 
thought to have been stolen from a florida parking lot was actually 
repossessed 
during the fiveday trip the young players and their chaperones 
faced repeated bus breakdowns sleepless nights a shortened trip 
to walt disney world and two humiliating losses in football 
the lowlight of the trip may have been the disappearance of one 
of three buses used to transport the team along with 2200 in 
donated cash radios cameras jackets and other personal 
possessions on board 
the bus vanished from the parking lot of an orlandoarea high 
school during the second of two pop warner league football games 
involving the teams many of the 116 group members were left 
stranded in lake city fla and forced to buy airline or bus 
tickets back to chicago 
team officials discovered tuesday that the bus had been 
repossessed and was parked at the abc bus co compound in winter 
garden fla the chicago tribune reported today 
an abc official in winter garden said he found 2209 in cash on 
the bus but little else 
if we can get the 2200 back it would be a thrill said 
roxanne whited president of the teams we were left high and 
dry 
whited blamed the repossession on falcon motorcoach co which 
provided the group with the buses two of which broke down 
repeatedly on the trip 
but ken arnold one of falcons owners said his company is not 
to blame because he had leased the bus from another company bampb 
tours in south suburban markham 
bampb officials in turn said they had leased the bus from yet 
another firm grand tour by linda of harvey la and had no 
idea the company was behind on payments and that the bus might be 
repossessed 
bampb repairs buses among other things bernard jackson a 
manager of bampb said that his company had repaired the bus that was 
repossessed but that grand tour hadnt paid the bill grand tour 
had made arrangements for bampb to use the bus as partial payment for 
the work 
jackson said its a common for companies that own buses to 
employ repossessors to reclaim the vehicles when payments are 
overdue 
these guys ride around all over the united states to the 
hotspots where buses might be and when they see the bus they 
snatch it jackson said today 
officials at grand tour by linda could not be reached for 
comment the companys telephone was disconnected 
bob yochum an official at abcs headquarters in faribault 
minn refused to comment about the repossession its a private 
business transaction he said

seven years after congress sought to improve 
government management major problems still are ignored or 
corrected slowly leaving a seemingly neverending 
multibilliondollar legacy of waste a watchdog agency said today 
management deficiencies program abuses and illegal activities 
cost the taxpayers billions of dollars and undermine their 
confidence in government the general accounting office said 
this situation is unacceptable under any circumstance but 
becomes even more serious in light of overwhelming budget 
deficits said gao the investigative arm of congress 
the gaos chief comptroller general charles a bowsher told a 
senate hearing today that the office of management and budget had 
taken recent steps to demand improved agency management but alone 
could not do enough 
and he laid much of the blame for mismanagement on the 
deregulation and domestic budget cuts during the reagan 
administration he said those steps were taken without a plan to 
improve oversight of the private sectors spending of government 
money 
we have been pennywise and really pound foolish bowsher 
said 
gao said it found that myriad examples of mismanagement fraud 
waste and abuse had been uncovered in annual assessments of 
government agencies required under the 1982 financial integrity act 
but many of the problems persist years after being identified 
the report said blaming a lack of agency leadership shortsighted 
decisionmaking and a failure of congress and the white house to 
aggressively oversee government management 
there is a seemingly neverending and costly trail of 
mismanagement abuse and illegal acts involving federal programs 
the gao said in the report to the senate government affairs 
committee most of the problems are known and in many instances 
have been known for years but they remain uncorrected 
bowsher said gao had decided to launch a governmentwide review 
to identify areas most ripe for abuse he called on congress to 
expand its oversight and to demand evidence of improved financial 
management as part of the budgetwriting process 
gao also suggested a businesslike approach to government 
management recommending creation of a chief financial officer for 
the government as a whole and for each major agency and requiring 
them to submit detailed annual reports to congress and to outside 
auditors 
bowsher warned against using budget deficits as an excuse not to 
deal with the problems many of which he blamed on secondrate 
and world war iiera financial management systems but he said the 
new financial systems needed to correct the problems would 
ultimately pay for themselves 
bowsher and the report cited a litany of spending blunders by 
the government some of them previously cited in prior gao reports 
and said many were made in attempts to improve program management 
the report noted the navy spent 230 million before halting 
installation of an automated financial management system 
originally intended to cost 33 million but whose cost estimate 
grew to a staggering 479 million 
also it cited the internal revenue services decision to 
abandon after spending 187 million a 18 billion automated tax 
return examination system 
the report said government spending on information technology 
and management has nearly doubled to 17 million since the 
financial integrity act was passed in 1982 but that there is little 
coordination between government agencies when they seek to improve 
their management systems 
invariably these systems do not work as planned have cost 
overruns of millions and even hundreds of millions of dollars and 
are not developed on time the report said 
as examples the report cited 
federal housing administration projections that its 1988 losses 
were 860 million a later private audit put the pricetag at 42 
billion 
the irs inability to identify and collect more than 50 
billion in delinquent taxes roughly 64 percent of the 89 billion 
owed the government but uncollected despite the mounting deficits 
the gao study found that 50 percent of the managers charged with 
conducting the internal management reviews required by the 1982 law 
had not been trained to properly do so

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
nov 24 
los angeles times on the 101st congress 
the first session of the 101st congress blessedly faded into the 
bleak november washington dawn more notable for all that it 
undid or left undone than for its few achievements 
the house and senate dismantled a major program the 1988 
catastrophic health care system which sank under an antitax 
backlash they then pasted together a 147 billion budget deficit 
reduction measure with a good deal of whole cloth in the form of 
fiscal shell games and hush some 6 billion in various revenue 
enhancements ie tax increases 
sustantial progress was made on new programs such as the clean 
air act and child care and the escalating demands of the 
grammrudman deficit reduction law may compel president bush to 
do something he failed to do this year to lay a coherent fiscal 
program before congress in january 
at the outset the new president had lots of good will in 
congress but he lost several big ones in his first year including 
his fight to fulfill a major campaign pledge the capital gains 
tax cut and his selection for secretary of defense john tower 
a blessing in disguise since he got the able dick cheney 
instead and he may have tripped himself up politically with his 
hardline position against public funding for abortion even in 
cases of rape and incest 
the challenge for bush is to develop a congressional agenda with 
clear direction and to demonstrate a willingness to support his 
kinder gentler leanings with the necessary money

the news and courier charleston sc on the iowa blast probe 
since the navys own investigator made his original report he 
has changed his explanation of what triggered the blast at first 
he said it was an electronic detonator he now says it probably was 
a chemical device 
yet even before the april tragedy crewmen and their families 
had been reporting accidents on board the iowa incidents not 
mentioned in the navys report 
there are conflicting stories about seaman clayton hartwig 
who died in the blast and was blamed some of his shipmates 
regarded him as depressed others did not others said he was 
looking forward to his new assignment in london and that he lacked 
the technical expertise to construct the kind of device that 
allegedly caused the explosion 
and too there are disturbing questions about how the 
investigation itself was conducted at least one seaman said he was 
threatened with severe retribution by navy investigators if he 
didnt tell the story they wanted him to 
as a result the armed services committees of both the senate 
and house have launched special inquiries into the explosion as 
has the general accounting office also under examination is the 
navys handling of its own investigation 
the inquiries are more than justified the navy may indeed turn 
out to be correct in its conclusions but the evidence and the 
methods used by the service raise fears that rather than pursuing 
the truth navy investigators sought to shift blame for the tragedy 
from the navy to a seaman no longer here to defend himself

philadelphia daily news on ussalvador 
no wonder the united states has trouble finding an answer in 
central america we cant even figure out what the question isnt 
for instance it is not whether the government of el salvador is 
duly constituted or elected maybe it is but so is the government 
of nicaragua which the united states has made a holy crusade of 
overthrowing 
it is not whether the 15 million that gets soaked up every day 
by the salvadoran government helps the people of el salvador it 
does not it goes for weapons to keep the people in line and to 
keep the thugs in charge in charge 
it is not a question of maintaining ourselves as some kind of 
moderating influence moving a nation toward democracy or at least 
away from official murder we have no influence in el salvador we 
cant even get murderers arrested 
it is not a question of fending off communism the worlds most 
overrated threat the very fact of our providing aid to oppressors 
provides the only soil in which communism seems to thrive 
the only question that matters is one the congress of the united

central maine morning sentinel waterville maine on 
ussalvador 
even in el salvador where the only thing more chronic than war 
and violence is poverty last weeks murder of six jesuit 
priests their housekeeper and the housekeepers daughter was 
shockingly savage 
the six massacred jesuits were scholars and teachers and 
political activists part of what has become known as liberation 
theology they opposed the rightwing cristiani government which 
has denounced the murders and pledged to bring the perpetrators to 
justice 
despite that pledge the murders have stretched us support for 
the salvadoran government to its limit the us house came 
within 21 votes of passing a bill that would have cut aid to el 
salvador which now totals 500 million a year by a third 
but should the aid have been suspended not this time not for 
this incident foreign policy liberal or conservative should not 
be dictated by reactions to single incidents of violence decisions 
should be made after careful consideration of the broader 
situation and the broader situation in el salvador is both violent 
and muddy

the arizona republic phoenix on czechoslovakia 
no hyperbole has been spared in describing the momentous events 
shaking eastern europe in recent weeks tonguetied correspondents 
pundits and the people themselves poles hungarians and east 
germans have fumbled for sufficiently forceful adjectives to 
depict the historic developments 
but the prize for understatement must go to milos jakes the 
general secretary of the czech communist party who along with the 
rest of the top party leadership resigned friday nov 24 
in a speech to his besieged comrades just before the mass 
capitulation jakes said that perhaps they had underestimated 
completely the processes taking place in poland hungary and 
especially east germany and their effect and influence on our 
society 
for jakes the light apparently dawned when upward of 
300000 of his countrymen marched in pragues 650yearold 
wenceslas square the largest gathering in the history of 
czechoslovakia 
the demonstration culminated weeklong uprisings in prague 
bratislava and other cities capped by the triumphal return of 
alexander dubcek who championed the illfated 1968 democracy 
movement that was crushed so ruthlessly by soviet tanks 
if there once was light dubcek told his cheering 
countrymen why should there be darkness again let us bring 
back the light 
the old guard feels betrayed by moscow after the red army 
smashed the quixotic 68 revolt the czech party became one of the 
most servile in the communist bloc toadying unabashedly to moscow 
now mikhail gorbachev preoccupied with his own problems has 
abandoned these czech sycophants leaving them to their own devices

corvallis ore gazettetimes on extending chinese students 
visas 
the chinese government is threatening diplomatic retaliation 
against the united states for the congressional passage of a bill 
to allow chinese students to stay in this country 
under current law foreigners on student visas must return home 
for at least two years after completing their education before they 
can apply for a different visa status the bill passed by congress 
would eliminate the twoyear requirement for the chinese students 
now legally in this country 
beijing is trying to send a message to the students that 
they have nothing to fear by returning home 
the message is completely unbelievable it comes from a 
government that used tanks and armed soldiers to kill peaceful 
demonstrators and has imprisoned leaders of the protest movement 
 
one of the great tragedies of history occurred following 
world war ii this country joined other allies in the forced 
repatriation to the soviet union of people who had fled or been 
captured in battle after promising that no harm would come to 
these people the soviet government killed or imprisoned them 
forcing students back to china could have the same tragic 
results as that sorry episode president bush should learn from 
history and sign the visa bill into law

oshkosh wis northwestern on drug use and student grants 
there is a bit of resentment on college campuses these days 
because uncle sam is insisting on an oath of no drug usedealing in 
order to get federal student grants 
it is not unlike the requirement a few years ago that students 
must comply with the requirements of the selective service law 
before they could have grants 
the main point is that those federal grants to students are not 
something to which the students are entitled as a right 
it makes sense that a government which is appropriating large 
amounts of money in a war on drugs should see to it that other 
federal money is not being spent at crosspurposes 
the issue is larger than pell grants to students though the 
issue is whether there should be attached qualifications for grants 
in general 
of course there should 
if the grant is for education it would be silly if the grant 
were not made with an attached string for instance that the money 
be used for education and it is entirely reasonable that the 
government requires the recipients to maintain a clear record 
whether clear of felonies or clear of drugrelated offenses

northeast mississippi daily journal tupelo miss on gun 
control 
james brady testified before a senate subcommittee last week 
his subject not surprisingly was handgun control 
brady is something of a walking miracle he was ronald reagans 
press secretary in 1981 when a bullet ripped through his brain 
during an assassination attempt on the president 
bradys testimony was brave and riveting he called the congress 
cowardly lions for its failure to enact even the most 
restrained controls on handgun sales his words should pierce the 
conscience of every congressman who has voted against a sensible 
sevenday waiting period for handgun purchases 
the bill is nothing more than an attempt to keep mentally 
deranged people and outright criminals from legally buying 
handguns it is not designed to keep any lawabiding citizen in 
his right mind from owning a gun 
now let the national rifle association and other groups come 
forward claiming guncontrol backers are unpatriotic wimps james 
brady puts the lie to that absurd claim 
brady casts the issue in a clear light that must be considered 
gun control is not a matter of gun ownership alone it is a 
matter of human life life is more important than owning a handgun

the flint mich journal on faith and spiritual values 
baby boomers who filled church and synagogue pews as children in 
the 1950s are returning to the fold with their children this is 
good news indeed for a nation that often struggles awkwardly with 
religion and the crucial role it plays in our lives 
in a study presented to the american academy of religion 
sociologists wade clark roof and david roozen found that 40 percent 
of those born between 1945 and 1954 said they were attending 
worship services regularly last year only 33 percent of this same 
generation reported regular attendance in the early 1970s 
perhaps they are discovering or rediscovering the imph and spiritual 
values not only for themselves and their 
families but for society as a whole 
what can be more basic more fundamental than ones thoughts 
and beliefsortance of 
fait about god that relationship no matter whether one is 
an atheist agnostic or devoted to god through a particular faith 
is key to how we think about ourselves and others and how we think 
about the here and the hereafter 
and yet some people be they believers or atheists try to 
pretend that religion is something separate something reserved for 
a saturday or sunday they lump religion with politics and sex as 
subjects of conversation to avoid 
it haslaw is necessary to encourage 
parental involvement and protect minors health 
about half the states have laws requiring parental consent but 
most of the laws have been invalidated after court challenges 
groups on both sides of the abortion issue had looked to the 
supreme court this term to help clarify its allegiance to roe vs 
wade but the settlement of the illinois case involving strict 
regulations on abortion clinics may eliminate the greatest 
immediate threat to that 1973 decision the illinois settlement 
still must be approved by a federal judge 
however the courts decisions in the ohio and minnesota cases 
expected by july still are sure to pack an enormous impact 
nationwide about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teenagers 
who become pregnant each year seek abortions of the 15 million 
legal abortions performed annually since 1973 about 12 percent 
180000 each year have been for minors 
the court touched off a political firestorm in july by voting 
54 to give states greater power to regulate abortions four 
justices appeared ready to go even further and overturn roe vs 
wade oconnor refused 
but she has been critical of the 1973 ruling and has not 
discounted the chance she someday would vote to reverse it 
neither ohio nor minnesota is asking the court to reverse roe 
vs wade but the bush administration has 
although it did not seek to participate in todays arguments 
the bush administration urged the court to use the minnesota case 
to rule that women have no constitutional right to abortion 
we continue to believe that roe was wrongly decided and should 
be overruled justice department lawyers said in a 
friendofthecourt brief 
the disputed ohio law was passed by the state legislature in 
1985 but never took effect due to a successful legal challenge by 
an akron abortion clinic and one of its doctors max pierre gaujean 
the law would have required any doctor asked to perform an 
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girls 
parents at least 24 hours before the operation 
a young girl could seek to bypass parental notification by 
seeking a state judges permission to have the abortion 
a federal judge struck down the law and that ruling was upheld 
by the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
the minnesota law requires such young girls to notify both 
biological parents at least 48 hours before obtaining an abortion 
the 1981 law makes doctors criminally liable for violations 
after enforcement of the law was blocked a judicialbypass 
provision took effect it allows a girl to avoid notifying her 
parents by convincing a judge she is mature and capable of giving 
informed consent or that not notifying her parents would be in 
her best interests 
the notification law with the judicialbypass option was in 
effect in minnesota for five years before it was struck down by a 
federal judge 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals reversed that ruling last 
year and said the law is constitutional the appeals court 
however blocked enforcement of the law pending supreme court 
action 
the cases are ohio vs akron center for reproductive health 
88805 and hodgson vs minnesota 881125 and 881309

in a lawsuit filed tuesday in us district court dallasbased 
madd sought unspecified money for alleged damage to its efforts to 
promote the interests of people opposed to drunken driving

john klasavich speaks no russian and 
marina enikeeva speaks no english but that will not stop the 
american from marrying the soviet next month 
klasavich of old orchard beach plans to fly to archangel a 
soviet city near the arctic circle to marry the woman he met on a 
trip in june to improve ussoviet relations 
everybody thinks im crazy except the people who were on that 
trip he said they understand perfectly how this could 
happen 
klasavich and 42 other mainers spent four days in archangel as 
part of the sistercity exchange between greater portland and the 
soviet port city of about 400000 people 
you would have thought we were royalty there klasavich 
said they were the warmest and friendliest people that ive ever 
met 
the wedding has generated so much excitement in archangel that 
it may be broadcast on the citys television station and the mayor 
will be at the reception said klasavich a telephone equipment 
installer 
it took only one day and a river cruise for klasavich 44 and 
enikeeva 23 to know that something was happening between them he 
returned to archangel four months later and won support from 
enikeevaa mother and grandmother before he dropped to one knee in 
front of the family and asked her to marry him 
us immigration officials estimate it will be at least three 
months after the wedding before soviet and us red tape can be 
cleared to bring enikeeva and her 4yearold son from a previous 
marriage to maine where they intend to live 
he said he sometimes wonders how they will manage without an 
interpreter whether their age difference is too great and whether 
she is marrying him only to get out of the soviet union as some of 
his friends have suggested 
but he says i cant stand the idea of living without her 
its that simple

americans suspicions of the soviet unions 
motives are fading rapidly with a majority of people now convinced 
that the soviets do not seek to dominate the world a national poll 
has found 
as presidents bush and mikhail gorbachev prepare for their 
weekend summit off malta the poll found overwhelming belief that 
the soviet leader seeks real reform in his country although 
opinion was mixed on his prospects 
both men were highly popular in the media generalassociated 
press poll with gorbachev outpolling bush among the mosteducated 
americans a plurality said gorbachev has done more than bush to 
ease eastwest tensions 
their meeting comes at a moment of great change in the communist 
world while gorbachev pushes liberal reforms in the soviet union 
his eastern european allies have taken dramatic steps toward 
democracy in recent weeks 
forty percent of the 1117 adults surveyed nov 1725 rated bush 
as too cautious in encouraging reform in the soviet union and 
eastern europe still 46 percent said he was doing enough the 
rest were unsure 
respondents by a 21 margin favored establishing normal trade 
relations with the soviets a step that administration officials 
are exploring a far less likely move us foreign aid to the 
soviets was soundly opposed 
despite good will toward gorbachev personally the poll found 
lingering doubt about soviet reliability with 53 percent saying 
the soviets cannot be trusted to live up to their arms control 
agreements the level of doubt was down though from 61 percent in 
a poll last year 
reflecting the cautious view 52 percent in the new poll said 
the united states should not significantly reduce military spending 
because of lessening eastwest tensions the bush administration is 
contemplating sizable cuts in its military budget 
respondents were divided on whether the united states should 
remove all of its troops from western europe if the soviets removed 
theirs from eastern europe of those who had an opinion 47 percent 
favored such a deal and 42 percent were opposed a split within the 
polls 3point error margin 
by a 6825 percent margin respondents opposed immediate cuts in 
us troops stationed in western europe as a response to reforms in 
the east but among those who opposed cuts a majority said they 
would favor troop reductions later if the reforms continue 
on the broadest eastwest issue respondents by a 5735 percent 
margin rejected the notion that the soviet union is trying to 
dominate the world with the rest unsure just last spring 50 
percent in a cbs newsnew york times poll said they believed the 
soviets did seek world domination 
despite the divided opinion on bushs caution in encouraging the 
communist changes 74 percent approved of his handling of 
ussoviet relations overall and 70 percent had a favorable 
opinion of bush in general the same high level of popularity he 
enjoyed in a gallup poll in may 
sixtyeight percent expressed a favorable view of gorbachev 
virtually the same rating as bushs and well up from 54 percent in 
a media generalap poll in april 1988 before a summit between 
gorbachev and thenpresident reagan 
moreover gorbachev was more popular than bush an 85 percent 
favorable rating compared to bushs 65 percent among respondents 
with postgraduate educations gorbachev also outscored reagan among 
this group in 1988 
in another measure of gorbachevs strong position 41 percent 
said he has done more than bush to ease eastwest tensions while 
29 percent said bush has done more thirty percent were unsure 
the high regard for gorbachev translated into a generally 
optimistic view of his chances among the 77 percent who believed 
he seeks meaningful reform in the soviet union 60 percent expected 
him to succeed 15 percent said he is likely to fail and a quarter 
were unsure of the outcome

a stonemason has patented a tombstone designed to 
keep standing through severe earthquakes saving high replacement 
costs in a country where elaborate expensive markers reflect deep 
respect for ancestors 
my earthquakeproof tombstones can resist even a temblor as 
strong as the great kanto earthquake said toshihiko nagoya 41 
the 1923 earthquake estimated at 79 on the richter scale 
destroyed much of tokyo then a city of 2 million people and 
killed 140000 tokyos population is now 12 million 
the new tombstone uses stainless steel poles implanted in the 
center and its parts are pressed together with nagoyas special 
glue he tested it with the help of tokyo universitys seismology 
department 
japan sitting along a major geological fault is hit by 
hundreds of quakes annually although most are too weak to be felt 
the idea for the new tombstone came after nagoya inspected the 
wreckage of statues and tombstones some costing nearly 70000 
after a strong earthquake two years ago in chiba just outside 
tokyo 
almost everything was destroyed at many temples and graveyards 
i visited he said 
more stunning was the death of a woman hit by a falling stone 
lantern in the quake measured at 66 on the richter scale 
the new quakeresistant tombstone would not cost much more than 
the normal price of up to 35000 he said existing tombstones can 
be made quakeresistant for about 1045 he added

overran the home of a us embassy officer in the capital of el 
salvador today and attacked the residences of other embassy workers 
as well the bush administration said today 
secretary of state james a baker iii told reporters the 
guerrillas had been shooting their way into and invading certain 
private homes in san salvador the capital 
they briefly overran the home of a us embassy officer but 
were driven out by the salvadoran armed forces he told 
reporters also saying 
it is our belief that all united states personnel and their 
families are safe but several are in their homes in this area of 
heavy fighting 
the guerillas burned a mansion blocks away from the official 
residence of us ambassador william walker 
the early morning attacks were in the affluent escalon 
neighborhood where the rebels last week took over a sheraton 
hotel entrapping six us green berets during a 27hour standoff 
with government forces 
it was not immediately clear if todays fighting signaled the 
resumption of a major guerrilla offensive on the capital that began 
nov 11 and appeared to have ended when the rebels withdrew nov 22 
residents of the affluent escalon neighborhood said they heard 
several loud explosions near the fortified complex between 2 am 
and 3 am 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater first announced the 
attacks saying he had little information as he was being 
questioned about reported harsh tactics in a crackdown by the 
rightist government of usbacked president alfredo cristiani 
asked about the raids by cristianis government on church and 
labor offices the arrests of civilians and other tactics of the 
counteroffensive crackdown fitzwater said our response is that 
we deplore violence and killing on both sides 
pressed as to whether the administration had communicated any 
concerns to the cristiani government he said we have made our 
views known to both sides publicly and privately that we are 
opposed to the killing and the violence there 
president bush has repeatedly voiced strong support for 
cristiani in the war against the marxist rebels 
for his part baker told reporters that with regard to reports 
of rightwing death squad activity i think its important that 
they do everything they can to get control of that kind of 
activity 
fitzwater appeared to take a softer approach today to the arrest 
of connecticut church worker jennifer j casolo by the salvadoran 
police than on monday when he had said there are indications 
that she was involved with a cache of weapons found buried in the 
backyard of her residence in san salvador 
he said she would be charged with illegal explosives and weapons 
when the police arrived at her house on sunday she telephoned 
the us consul general fitzwater said a consular officer went 
immediately to her home and stayed with her during her arrest and 
through that night 
fitzwater said that during her four years in el salvador miss 
casolo had become known to embassy ofifcials thorugh her work 
with christian education sminars and coordinating non ofifcial 
delgations to el salvador 
we have been monitoring her case closely to assure she is well 
treated the embassy will continue to assure that she is given 
every benefit due her under salvadoran law

local telephone companies may have to refund 
as much as 75 million to longdistance companies and large 
privateline business customers the federal communications 
commission says 
the local phone companies accumulated overcharges between 1985 
and 1988 under fcc guidelines that allowed prices of these 
highcapacity privateline services to exceed the phone companies 
costs of providing the services 
the fcc ordered a refund tuesday as it considered challenges to 
the special pricing scheme which the local phone companies provide 
for longdistance companies or large business customers 
the commission voted 40 that the scheme was legal during the 
198588 period when the high prices were designed to keep too many 
customers from switching from the regular public telephone network 
to private lines but that market conditions today no longer 
justified continuation of the special pricing 
the commission said it expected the local phone companies to 
refrain from requesting such special prices in the future 
while it was examining the challenges to the special pricing 
scheme the commission said it found that local phone companies in 
some cases had charged more than allowed under the commissions 
guidelines therefore the companies must refund those charges 
which could amount to as much as 75 million the commission said 
the fcc said the amount of the refunds will not be known until 
the local phone companies file detailed reports with the 
commission the companies have 40 days to make their filings 
the companies found not to be in compliance with the 
commissions pricing guidelines from oct 1 1985 to dec 31 
1986 were 
diamond state south central bell in alabama southwestern bell 
in missouri and oklahoma northwestern bell in iowa minnesota 
nebraksa and north dakota and pacific northwest bell in idaho

despite a long history of supporting lebanese 
christians israeli officials say they wont intervene this time to 
defend christian gen michel aoun from syrian attack 
the bitter experience of israels occupation of lebanon from 
198285 is largely responsible for the change in policy 
however the israelis have issued new warnings to syria about 
making moves they say would endanger israels security and its 
northern border 
for example maj gen avihu binnun the israeli air force 
chief said on armed forces radio wednesday that surprise flights 
by syrian warplanes over lebanese territory where israelis 
routinely patrol could lead to clashes 
referring to reports that a syrian mig23 had buzzed aouns 
presidential palace in baabda binnun said there is no doubt 
that entrances like this to lebanon can result in a clash even 
unwanted 
he hinted at diplomatic contacts to prevent greater tensions and 
said we are trying to make sure that the lebanese do not get us 
involved in a war that we dont intend and we hope we will succeed 
in that 
israel has insisted it needs a clear view from lebanons 
airspace to protect its border from attacks by palestinian and 
iranianbacked shiite moslem guerrillas it also has used the skies 
to launch 15 air raids on guerrilla targets this year 
officials have said israel would not tolerate syrian troops 
moving south of sidon and the awali river about 25 miles north of 
israels border or into areas israel evacuated in june 1985 at the 
end of the threeyear occupation those areas include the bekaa 
valley 
the occupation produced a consensus that is strongly against 
renewed israeli involvement the war cost the lives of 650 israeli 
soldiers damaged israels image abroad and caused deep political 
splits at home 
israel invaded lebanon in june 1982 following clashes in which 
israeli troops went to the defense of christian militiamen being 
attacked by syrian forces 
israel threw its military backing and political support to 
bashir gemayel a christian militia chief but gemayel was 
assassinated in 1982 reportedly with syrian involvement and 
israels hopes for a friendly lebanese government were undone 
the christian militias refusal to play a major role in driving 
out palestinian guerrillas also caused deep resentment in israels 
army 
lt gen dan shomron the chief of staff said last week that 
israel had no plans to intervene in the current standoff between 
aoun and syrian troops unless its own security was threatened 
as a matter of principle and policy we do not involve 
ourselves in lebanon as long as there is no syrian threat or other 
threat along our northern border he said 
one senior israeli official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said israel would not support aoun just because he was a christian 
leader 
we are tired of backing losers in lebanon the official said 
however there was lingering support among some israelis for 
aouns antisyria campaign especially in the rightwing led by 
prime minister yitzhak shamir 
rafael eytan a former chief of staff and now a member of 
parliament said wednesday that israel should support aoun 
he said syrian gains in lebanon will bring increased pressure 
on us in southern lebanon where israel still supports a 
2500member christianled militia known as the south lebanon army

shell oil has agreed to pay 1975 
million in penalties and compensation for a 1988 spill of more than 
400000 gallons of crude oil that fouled a scenic waterway near san 
francisco the mayor says 
mayor mike menesini said tuesday the agreement is the largest 
oil spill settlement in california history 
it provides a clear warning that harm to our environment will 
not be tolerated he said 
the spill fouled a 15mile stretch of the carquinez strait 
shoreline and a marsh next to shells refinery it killed at least 
300 birds and animals 
menesini said shell will pay 11 million to restore damaged 
wetlands and an additional 47 million in civil penalties for 
violating federal rules in allowing the oil to bypass a collection 
dike and pour into the waterway 40 miles northeast of san francisco 
the settlement also will pay for such things as environmental 
studies of the affected areas and restoration of the fishing 
industry 
the oil company admitted that it illegally allowed storm water 
to drain from the top of a 125 million gallon oil storage tank 
and that oil leaked through a flexible pipe in the middle of the 
tank and made its way into the waterway 
shell had ignored a federal requirement to monitor the drainage 
system before making discharges allong discharges to go directly 
into state waters 
additional settlement details were to be released at a news 
conference in san francisco this afternoon

regulations that ban panhandling in the subway 
system violate the constitutional rights of homeless people who may 
need to beg to survive according to a lawsuit filed by advocates 
for the homeless 
the classaction lawsuit brought tuesday in us district court 
challenges operation enforcement a recent drive by the 
metropolitan transportation authority to enforce existing rules 
including the prohibition on panhandling 
the lawsuit charged that the ban on begging singles out the 
homeless because it allows other people to solicit contributions 
for charitable religious and political causes 
the intended purpose is simply to roust the homeless and needy 
from the subways the lawsuit said 
the regulation violates the first and 14th amendment rights of 
the homeless it charged 
to deny them this exercise of free speech is to deny them the 
means to survive for they spend the money they ask for on the very 
necessities of life that is on food shelter clothing 
transportation and medicine the lawsuit said 
the plaintiffs are two homeless men who panhandle in the subway 
system the lawsuit brought by the legal action center for the 
homeless was filed on behalf of all homeless people in the state 
the defendants are the mta and two of its agencies the transit 
authority and the metronorth commuter railroad 
we dont believe its a constitutional right to panhandle but 
its an obvious issue for the courts to decide said mta 
spokesman tito davila 
the lawsuit seeks a court order barring the mta from enforcing 
the ban on panhandling a hearing is scheduled friday before judge 
leonard sand

in the year since mikhail s gorbachev last 
met with a us president the soviet leaders world has turned 
topsyturvy with a legislature challenging him at home and 
demonstrators chasing communist regimes from power in eastern 
europe 
on the us side the change is less striking simply the man at 
the top 
as george bush prepares for his first meeting as president with 
gorbachev the world overseas appears to be changing at a faster 
pace than at any time since world war ii when president franklin 
d roosevelt began the practice of sitting down for a summit with 
the soviet leader at that time josef stalin 
since the most recent superpower summit on dec 7 1988 when 
gorbachev met with president reagan and thenvice president bush in 
new york poland has formed the first noncommunist government in 
the soviet bloc hungary has scrapped its communist party east 
germany has opened the berlin wall bulgaria has dumped its 
longtime communist boss and the czechoslovakian communist party 
has surrendered its monopoly on power 
only romania long a maverick in the warsaw pact has remained 
cold to the thaw started by gorbachev after he rose to power in 
march 1985 
for years the soviets complained about what they perceived as 
the tumult of the us electoral process with presidential 
balloting every four years and congressional races every two 
clouding the rare air of geopolitics 
now the united states seems tranquil compared to the 
freeforall in the communist world 
bush under pressure to respond to changes in the soviet bloc 
scheduled the meeting with gorbachev off the mediterranean isle of 
malta this weekend he has also begun planning for a military 
cutback 
he would be hard put to keep pace with the revolution in eastern 
europe 
in the soviet union the communist party was embarrassed in 
elections last march the most democratic legislature in 72 years 
of soviet history is learning to stand up to the government and the 
party and ethnic unrest has shaken the country from the baltic sea 
to central asia 
on the international front bush administration officials like 
their predecessors are complaining that soviet surrogates 
nicaragua and cuba are exporting revolution to el salvador 
closer to moscow soviet troops pulled out of afghanistan last 
february but the kremlinbacked government there remains in power 
the president of the usbacked afghan interim government in 
exile sibghatullah mojaddedi on monday said he wants bush to 
pressure gorbachev to end support for the puppet government and 
reach a political accord with the resistance 
in arms control many hurdles have been cleared but the 
superpowers have not finalized deals to cut nuclear conventional 
and chemical weapons 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told secretary of 
state james a baker iii last september in wyoming that the kremlin 
was removing two major obstacles to a proposed strategic arms 
reduction treaty start to reduce longrange superpower nuclear 
weapons by up to 50 percent 
shevardnadze said the soviets were withdrawing the precondition 
that america abandon its star wars strategic defense initiative he 
also said the soviets were seeking a separate agreement to limit 
submarinelaunched cruise missiles rather than include them in 
start 
but the soviets have been pressing for talks to curb the might 
of the us navy and want to ban the submarine cruise missiles 
within that framework 
although changes have been more slow and orderly in the united 
states they have occurred bush has replaced reagan as president 
and after months of skepticism appears to have embraced gorbachevs 
reforms 
bushs apparent uncertainty prompted democrats led by senate 
majority leader george mitchell of maine to label the republican 
president as timid in responding to gorbachev 
bushs backers claim he has been playing a cool hand 
alternating his public hesitation with careful preparation and 
brilliant masterstrokes 
he was heavily criticized for not replying in kind to 
gorbachevs surprise announcement before his last summit with 
reagan that he was unilaterally withdrawing 50000 troops from 
eastern europe and cutting the red army by 500000 
then bush proposed last may that the two alliances agree within 
a year to make sharp cuts that would eliminate the warsaw pact 
numerical advantage 
now the alliances appear near an agreement under which the 
united states would reduce its forces in central europe by 30000 
and the soviets by ten times that many 
before the oct 31 announcement that he would meet with 
gorbachev in malta bush was criticized for not seeking a summit 
bush says and the soviets have not disagreed that he first 
requested the meeting after he traveled to poland and hungary last 
july and met with reform leaders who urged him to consult 
facetoface with the soviet leader

a decision to enforce an 11yearold health 
ordinance on a charitable groups functions has members scrambling 
to provide a christmas meal for thousands of hungry houston 
residents 
last week the health department started requiring the citywide 
club of clubs to follow an ordinance that requires food served to 
the public to be prepared at a cityapproved kitchen just in time 
to cause problems for the groups annual thanksgiving feast for the 
needy 
the private nonprofit community service organization has 
relied heavily in the past on donations of homeprepared food 
turkey hams dressing vegetables desserts relishes to pull 
off its annual thanksgiving and christmas feasts club director 
leroy woodward said tuesday 
last week because of the new enforcement volunteers faced with 
a record 60000 people for thanksgiving ran out of food three or 
four times and only the hasty barbecuing of 500 chickens saved the 
day he said 
now you cant get through our main telephone lines because of 
all the needy people calling up to make reservations for our annual 
christmas feast on dec 23 said woodward and were scared 
were afraid were not going to be able to feed all these folks 
joe zuchlewski a health department official was unable to 
explain why the group wasnt required to meet the ordinance until 
this year 
we appreciate all the work that the citywide club is doing in 
feeding all these people but by the same token we want to make 
sure the food is safe said zuchlewski were just trying to 
protect the public 
health department officials will gladly work with club members 
to make sure they know how to conduct their feast according to 
regulations zuchlewski said 
there are all kinds of items that can be donated that will 
satisfy people on the street and satisfy the health code 
zuchlewski said the department cited such things as canned 
vegetables or frozen turkeys 
woodward is worried but he hesitates to slam the health 
department 
they gave us their reason and we understand if people even 
put harmful things in trick or treat candy we understand the 
potential problem of letting people bring prepared food he said 
but even though we understand were still left with the 
problem of feeding all those hungry people 
in addition to feeding the hungry and needy the club last year 
distributed 12000 donated toys to children and registered more 
than 7000 people for jobs and housing

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today the united states and soviet union should seek mutual 
advantage from the dramatic changes in eastern europe and hinted 
that president bush would back improved soviet trade opportunities 
at this weekends superpower summit 
at the same time baker said the two days of talks between bush 
and soviet president mikhail gorbachev are not an arms control 
summit 
at a white house news conference on the day before bushs 
departure for a shipboard summit off malta baker also said the 
continued flow of sovietmade arms to leftist rebels in el salvador 
and the afghanistan government amounted to a cold war relic 
he stressed in a prepared statement and in reply to questions 
that ussoviet relations were on the upswing and that us 
support for gorbachevs perestroika or restructuring program to 
reform the soviet economy was firm 
baker said it would be a mistake not to support the reform 
movement sweeping the soviet union and eastern europe even if there 
is a chance the pace may bring some temporary instability 
the real question is not whether perestroika will succeed or 
fail he said the real question is this do you engage the 
soviet union in a search for mutual advantage in this time of 
uncertainty and our answer to that question is a resounding 
yes 
hardline communist governments have been removed from power in 
recent weeks in east germany czechoslovakia and bulgaria in 
addition to the changes that moved through poland and hungary 
earlier in the year 
gorbachev has expressed fears that the changes within the soviet 
bloc would be exploited by the west but in a nationally televised 
speech last wednesday night bush offered our assurance that 
america welcomes reform not as an adversary seeking advantage but 
as a people offering support 
baker broadly hinted that bush would offer to support soviet 
participation in the international group known as gatt the 
general agrement on tariffs and trade that would make it easier 
for the soviets to trade with other countries 
baker said the issue definitely was on the presidents summit 
agenda but he did not want to preempt bushs discussion with 
gorbachev and he said the success or failure of the summit 
depended on no single issue 
baker spoke as senate majority leader george mitchell said the 
bush administration needs a more meaningful response to the new 
political climate in the soviet union and urged the president to 
press for movement on trade and arms control at the summit 
while i welcome the administrations offer to provide 
technical advice to the soviet union i believe a more meaningful 
response is necessary the maine democrat told a news conference 
he again called for a trial waiver of trade restrictions aimed at 
the soviets under the socalled jacksonvanik amendment 
baker used his presummit appearance before reporters to take a 
hard line on central america and to rule out a deal in which the 
united states would cut off its assistance to rebels in afghanistan 
bakers remarks about el salvador where rebels recently renewed 
their offense against the government and soviet support for 
afghanistan and cambodia contrasted with an otherwise warm stance 
toward moscow 
baker said soviet behavior in regional conflicts contrasts 
sharply with the pattern of its conduct in eastern europe 
the continuing pattern of soviet arms shipments to moscows 
third world clients is especially disturbing this pattern is a 
cold war relic he said 
baker said that if gorbachev can promote perestroika and foster 
new thinking in eastern europe he can also stop throwing fuel on 
the fire in el salvador 
baker spoke as sources said the us budget squeeze may force 
bush to confront a proposed armed forces cutback even as he 
reassures the allies he will not cut a military deal with gorbachev 
behind their backs at the summit 
on bushs desk before his takeoff thursday evening for the 
mediterranean could be a recommendation from defense secretary dick 
cheney to trim the army navy air force and marine corps by 
275000 or 129 percent from current levels defense sources told 
the associated press on tuesday night 
the army would be reduced by 135000 the air force by 100000 
and the navy and marine corps by 40000 under a proposal from the 
us armed services chiefs said the sources who declined to be 
identified 
cheney will find the recommendation on his own desk when he 
flies home from europe early thursday the cuts would be carried 
out by 1994 and would involve the elimination of three army combat 
divisions five and a fraction air force fighter wings and about 60 
naval vessels the sources said 
the fleet includes 562 vessels and the idea would be to reduce 
to about 500 by 1994 
if cheney accepts the recommendation he would take it to the 
president before his departure for the summit richard darman the 
director of the office of management and budget is pushing for 
even deeper cutbacks in the us military the sources said 
it was not clear whether the president would make a decision 
before his takeoff and white house spokesman marlin fitzwater 
declined comment today on the matter 
he said the president planned to spend most of the day in 
preparation for the summit and would also discuss the summit at 
some length at a private dinner at the white house tonight for 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney 
the spokesman also said that bush had discussed the summit today 
by phone with west german chancellor helmut kohl they also 
discussed kohls new proposal for the reunification of germany the 
spokesman said

senate majority leader george mitchell on 
wednesday said the bush administration needs a more meaningful 
response to the new political climate in the soviet union and 
urged the president to press for movement on trade and arms control 
at the summit 
while i welcome the administrations offer to provide 
technical advice to the soviet union i believe a more meaningful 
response is necessary mitchell told a news conference he again 
called for a trial waiver of trade restrictions 
mitchell said the american people are united in support of 
president bush as he travels to this important meeting and he 
added that bush was right in his approach concerning possible 
discussion of arms control and military forces with soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev at the summit off malta 
he expressed hope that bush would reaffirm his commitment to a 
start treaty 
mitchell said the administration should say clearly it will 
abide by the 1972 abm treaty and abandon the view that it can 
reserve the right to unilaterally change the terms of a treaty 
limiting strategic defenses while seeking to conclude a binding 
agreement limiting strategic offenses 
he said that concluding the current conventional negotiations 
under way in vienna has assumed even greater importance in light of 
the changes taking place in eastern europe 
on trade mitchell said the bush administration should forget 
its offer to provide technical assistance to the soviets theyve 
not requested that mitchell said 
but we should demonstrate our willingness to move toward a 
trade relationship based on market principles rather than political 
proscriptions mitchell said 
he reiterated his suggestion of last may that the administration 
should grant a trial waiver of the jacksonvanik amendment which 
restricts trade with the soviets to bring pressure on moscow for 
freer emigration policies 
he said moscows loosening of emigration curbs over the last few 
years justifies such a move 
mitchell also urged bush to propose talks aimed at reaching a 
commercial trade agreement with the soviet union 
he said in response to a question that such an agreement would 
not result in any quick upturn in imports from the soviet union 
the reason is very simple theres very little produced in the 
soviet union that americans would be interested in buying they do 
not have a competitive economy and i think they realize this 
meanwhile 15 senators urged bush to raise the issue of 
political rights of baltic peoples at the summit 
this is of vital importance to the safety and security of both 
of our nations as well as to our allies in europe said a 
statement issued by the office of sen robert kasten rwis 
the lawmakers called on bush to tell gorbachev that economic 
assistance and trade with the united states must be linked with 
progress toward democracy in the baltic states

interior secretary manuel lujan tentatively 
has decided to renew longterm water leases for irrigation in 
central california but the bush administration remains divided on 
how to ease environmental concerns over the leases administration 
sources said wednesday 
objections from the white house prompted lujan to delay 
announcement of the lease renewal plan on tuesday according to the 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity a spokesman for the 
secretary disputed suggestions that the white house had blocked the 
decision but acknowledged that the lease announcement was 
postponed 
we wanted a unified administration position on this issue if 
delaying the process a few days will help us reach that its that 
much the better said interior spokesman steve goldstein he 
added the decision is the secretarys to make 
the renewal of the california water contracts one of the 
thorniest water issues in the west has developed into a major 
environmental test for the bush administration with critics of the 
40year leases arguing that they should not be renewed at current 
water supply levels and for such a lengthy duration 
according to administration sources lujan earlier this week 
decided to renew the leases without first requiring completion of a 
formal environmental review lujans plan called for initiating an 
environmental assessment as part of the lease renewal plan the 
sources said 
but the proposal ran into trouble at the white house after 
michael deland chairman of the presidents council on 
environmental quality objected to the fine print of the 
proposed environmental review according to the administration 
sources 
deland reportedly maintained that the environmental review 
suggested by lujan was meaningless because it would have had no 
effect on key provisions of the renewed water contracts such as 
length of the lease or volume of water being supplied 
deland raised the objections with white house chief of staff 
john sununu the sources said 
goldstein the interior spokesman denied that lujans proposal 
had been blocked by the white house he said that while there were 
some concerns from the council on environmental quality the delay 
resulted from legal questions and technical wording raised by the 
justice department and the office of management and budget 
environmentalists have filed a lawsuit against the interior 
department arguing federal environmental laws require a formal 
assessment of the environmental impact of such longterm leases 
before they are renewed the environmental protection agency also 
has argued no leases should be renewed until such an assessment is 
made and the council on environmental quality earlier this year 
sided with the epa 
the leases which are expected to expire over the next year 
provide more than 15 million acrefeet of federal water annually 
to irrigation districts across a broad expanse of central 
california 
lujan decided in april to proceed with renewing one of the 
leases providing water to the orange cove irrigation district in 
eastern san joaquin valley for 40 years without an environmental 
study 
that brought sharp criticism from environmentalists 
legislation was introduced in congress that if enacted would 
block any further lease renewals unless an environmental impact 
study is performed a federal judge in california warned that any 
lease renewals will be subject to his eventual decision on the 
lawsuit brought by the environmentalists 
the longterm irrigation leases are expiring at a time when 
california is struggling to develop new water distribution and 
water quality protection plans disputes over water has pitted 
northern californians against those in the southern part of the 
state and urban users against farmers 
there has been concern about how the diversions will affect 
water quality soil conditions and fish and wildlife habitat if 
such longterm diversions are allowed to continue critics also 
argue that the large water diversions have kept farmers from 
conserving water when growing urban centers are worried about 
future water shortages

american employers value the dependability and 
loyalty of older workers but most do little to recruit or retain 
these employees or to help them adapt to new technologies 
according to a private report released wednesday 
the study found a real gap between the positive attitudes 
being expressed and the actual mechanisms and practices that 
are now in place to utilize older workers said david meer of the 
daniel yankelovich group a research company 
the report commissioned by the american association of retired 
persons was based on telephone interviews with executives at 400 
businesses and on focus group discussions among employees age 
50 and older 
seventynine percent of the surveyed executives reported their 
companies were finding ways to leverage the experience of older 
workers but other research data did not support this success 
in tapping older workers skills the study said 
many older workers meanwhile see themselves as an untapped 
resource and feel frustrated about the scarcity of programs to help 
them contribute more on the job the report said 
when discussing their work situation older employees seem 
fearful it said they believe they are vulnerable even 
disposable 
skillstraining programs for older workers had been adopted by 
just three in 10 companies surveyed the same proportion as in a 
similar 1985 study and onefourth of businesses had a formal 
commitment to fully use older workers down from onethird in 1985 
it found 
one of the most disturbing findings of this study is the 
reported decline in senior managements formal commitment to 
utilizing older workers the report said 
unless more is done to help older workers adapt 
nontechnologically oriented older workers could find themselves 
shut out of rewarding wellpaying positions the report said 
meer predicted that growing labor shortages in the 1990s will 
force businesses to adopt new ways to integrate older workers into 
the workforce 
this will require new approaches to the way work is organized 
the types of jobs that are available the ability to have parttime 
work that is knowledgebased and not just serviceoriented he 
said 
aarp executive director horace deets said the report indicates 
businesses are shedding stereotypes of older people as being afraid 
of change unreliable and unable to learn new tasks but many 
companies have not translated that into action by hiring and 
retraining older workers 
deets said the message for older workers was 
you have to take the initiative to seek training and maintain 
needed skills an older worker cant wait for an employer to make 
the first move 
the study found that businesses give older workers high ratings 
on characteristics such as attendance punctuality reliability 
commitment to quality and loyalty for example 89 percent of 
employers rated their older workers as excellent or very good in 
commitment to quality 
older employees got their lowest marks on feeling comfortable 
with new technologies such as computers with just 22 percent of 
the businesses rating their older workers as excellent or very good 
in that category 
executives at the largest companies were prone to give older 
workers less credit for their work habits and to be more critical 
of their ability to adapt to technology the report said 
the report said that in addition to questions about older 
workers adaptability to new technology businesses also show 
growing concern about the cost to employ older workers 
particularly to provide them with health insurance it also found 
increasing use of early retirement programs to reduce costs

defense secretary dick cheney raised 
the possibility wednesday that nato and the warsaw pact might enter 
into a second set of negotiations to slash conventional arms and 
troops further in europe 
cheney said at the end of a twoday meeting at the north 
atlantic treaty organization that no decision had been made to go 
beyond the current bargaining in vienna to reduce nonnuclear 
forces in europe 
but he said i certainly would not rule out the 
possibility that after an agreement was reached in vienna the 
alliance would then decide upon further steps to accelerate and 
expand upon the pact 
he said he hoped that we will be able to persuade the soviets 
to ultimately withdraw all of their forces from eastern europe 
the current bargaining between the 16 nato nations and the seven 
of the warsaw pact is designed to reduce the easts enormous 
superiority in tanks artillery and armored troop carriers in 
europe both sides would be brought down to equal levels under 
proposals on the table 
as part of those talks president bush has suggested the united 
states and the soviet union pare their forces in europe to 275000 
on each side the plan would require the soviets to pull out 
300000 troops and the united states 30000 
an agreement on conventional armed forces in europe is expected 
in the second half of next year 
during meetings with other defense ministers cheney sought to 
dispel fears the united states would unilaterally pull its troops 
out of europe because of budget pressures and reduced eastwest 
tensions 
reports of american plans to clip military spending in coming 
years has prompted concern about the united states ties to its 
european allies 
cheney said that over time the united states could possibly 
contemplate additional reductions in deployments in europe 
but he said such cuts would take place only in the context 
of the alliance only based upon consultation with our allies and 
only based upon similar kinds of developments with respect to the 
east 
there has been no slackening in the us commitment to nato 
he insisted there will be no slackening in the us commitment 
to nato there will be no unilateral reductions in us deployments 
with respect to nato 
he said the united states share of total defense spending by 
nato nations amounted to 64 percent i do not expect that to 
change in significant ways he said 
nato secretarygeneral manfred woerner said defense ministers at 
the meeting found cheneys remarks realistic and reassuring 
he said said cheney made clear that no significant changes 
in us forces in europe were under consideration before an accord 
at vienna 
any major reductions beyond that he said would be done in 
consultation with the allies 
german defense minister gerhard stoltenberg said the united 
states sees future troop cuts to mean that europeans must take on 
more responsibility for the wests common defense 
in a final statement the defense ministers welcomed the rapid 
pace of political and economic reforms in the soviet union and 
eastern europe but urged caution 
a time of rapid political change presents the west with new 
opportunities although the resulting uncertainty also carries 
potential risks the statement said 
our defense requirements must continue to be assessed against 
the realities of warsaw pact military capabilities it said 
they noted the soviet union had taken initial steps to fulfill 
last years promises of unilateral arms reductions but said warsaw 
pact forces were still larger and betterequipped than in the west 
there has unquestionably been a change in the nature of the 
threat which confronts us said woerner but not yet a 
significant change in the military capability of the soviet union 
and the warsaw pact 
the ministers said they would follow a stepbystep approach to 
changes in the east and promised not to make any unilateral arms 
cuts that could hurt chances for an accord on conventional forces 
in europe 
the leaders of the nato nations will gather monday in brussels 
to hear about bushs weekend summit with president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
the alliances defense ministers meet twice year in their role 
as the defense planning committee france which is outside natos 
joint military structure does not attend iceland which has no 
armed forces has observer status

prime minister rajiv gandhi resigned 
wednesday and for only the second time since independence in 1947 
his congress party did not claim the right to form the next 
government 
opposition parties began trying to assemble a coalition 
gandhi submitted his resignation to president ramaswamy 
venkataraman and said he was ready for the role of opposition 
leader 
the people have given their verdict he said in a televised 
speech wednesday night in all humility we respect the verdict 
a new government will be formed we extend to them our good 
wishes and offer them our constructive cooperation said the 
45yearold former airline pilot who won his own parliament seat 
overwhelmingly for a third time 
congress won more parliament seats in last weeks elections than 
any other party but was far short of a majority 
venkataraman asked gandhi to remain in office as caretaker prime 
minister the resignation cleared the way for the national front 
alliance to form the next government for the worlds most populous 
democracy 
the congress party has been out of office only once before since 
independence from britain for 29 months after losing the 1977 
elections 
national front leaders predicted wednesday they would choose the 
next prime minister but differences arose among the five parties 
a meeting was delayed until thursday then friday while 
legislators from the alliance tried to persuade its main leader 
vishwanath pratap singh to take the job singh has repeatedly said 
he doesk not want it 
there will be trouble in the party if vp singh is not 
elected prime minister said jaipal reddy of janata dal or 
peoples party largest of the five parties in the national front 
singh is a former gandhi minister and ally who has become his 
most prominent political foe 
the national front and its allies picked up enough pledges of 
support from smaller parties wednesday form a majority in the 
543seat lok sabha the lower house of parliament where the power 
lies 
gandhis party is gambling that the coalition will be hamstrung 
by internal squabbling paving the way for congress to regain power 
congress legislators met wednesday night and unanimously 
reelected gandhi as parliamentary leader putting him in the 
position of becoming prime minister again if the opposition should 
fail and president venkataraman asked congress to form a government 
asked whether he was prepared to lead the opposition gandhi 
said with a smile absolutely we will be a very good watchdog 
later the partys parliamentary board decided not to claim the 
right to form the next government state tv reported 
throughout the campaign gandhi portrayed the election as a 
choice between the stability his government and potential chaos 
under the opposition 
many feuds have been reported within the national front since it 
was formed in august 1988 
leaders of the various parties set aside their differences after 
elections were called in midoctober but squabbling resumed while 
the votes were counted 
singh a 58yearold former defense and finance minister is the 
bestknown of its leaders but has said he just wants to be 
president of the janata dal 
another prominent janata dal member chandra shekhar said he 
was ready to be prime minister but some colleagues dont support 
him 
the taciturn 62yearold former socialist engineered the 
opposition victory in 1977 
as of now there is only one candidate reddy said 
despite persuasion vp singh is not a candidate and despite 
disuassion chandra shekhar remains one 
with 512 seats decided the congress party had 190 and its 
smaller allies 17 for a total of 207 the national front had 139 
and its allies 137 a total of 276 
it takes 263 seats for a majority in the lok sabha which will 
convene with 525 seats elections for the remaining 18 seats were 
postponed because of the deaths of candidates and other reasons 
gandhi entered parliament in 1981 and became prime minister in 
1984 after the assassination of his mother prime minister indira 
gandhi continuing the political dynasty started by his 
grandfather jawaharlal nehru 
as one of his last acts gandhi began the process of dropping 
criminal charges against simranjit singh mann a fomer police 
officer charged with conspiracy in the murder who was elected to 
parliament from punjab state 
he did not say why the charges were being dropped

the government has cited the air force 
for unsafe work conditions surrounding a fatal b52 fire alleging 
workers werent given proper tools and cigarette butts were found 
near where the plane was being fueled 
one worker was killed and 11 were injured in the july blaze at 
kelly air force base 
the notice tuesday from the occupational safety and health 
administration includes 16 willful violations and two 
serious ones no fines were imposed because the air force is a 
federal agency 
osha did not pinpoint the the fires cause but found several 
hazards were present among the violations cited were cigarette 
butts found within a 50foot safety zone however osha did not 
allege that workers were smoking 
osha also said an integral tank tool kit was not available 
for testing one of the planes fuel tanks l nicholas the 
agencys area director refused to elaborate today on how the lack 
of proper tools related to the accident 
the air force has until dec 11 to correct some violations but 
must correct others as soon as monday 
maj gen richard smith commander of the air logistics center 
said in a statement today that the osha citations parallel the air 
forces own findings and that corrective actions are already in 
progress 
the air force blamed the accident on an improperly constructed 
unapproved fuel tank vent plug mistakenly left on a fuel tank after 
the tank was tested for leaks that caused the tank to burst when 
filled according to the military 
osha also charged that the fire guard had left the refueling 
area and was not present to detect leaking fuel and give a warning 
and that supervisors didnt brief the refueling crew discuss 
escape routes or designate one person to direct refueling

the us economy grew moderately from july 
through september the government said wednesday but analysts said 
it has since weakened sharply threatening to derail an 
unprecedented peacetime expansion 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health grew at an annual rate of 27 
percent in the third quarter slightly higher than the 25 percent 
rate originally reported last month 
earlier this year economists had widely forecast only sluggish 
growth in the quarter but the revision means the third quarter 
topped the 25 percent second quarter rate 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said we always like to see increase in growth and this report 
is relatively good news in that sense 
however private analysts predicted with near unanimity a 
sharply weaker performance in the final three months of 1989 and 
the first quarter of next year a few expect the nation to topple 
into a recession ending the expansion which enters its eighth 
year in december 
we should enjoy these third quarter numbers because the 
chances are were not going to see their like anytime soon said 
economist robert dederick of northern trust co 
most economists attribute the current sluggishness to a 
yearlong antiinflation campaign by the federal reserve board 
which pushed interest rates up through this spring 
since then the fed has nudged rates lower but the economy 
wont reflect the full benefit of rate cuts and any further 
declines in the next few months until later next year 
the reason the economy will skirt a recession but not fall 
into one is interest rates are coming down substantially said 
economist bruce steinberg of merrill lynch he predicted a further 
decline in rates next month 
in other economic news an administration source who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity said that president bush planned to name 
assistant treasury secretary david w mullins jr to a vacancy on 
the federal reserve board economists said the appointment was 
likely to give the administration which has sought a looser 
monetary policy a greater voice in the feds decisions 
although the gnp revision wednesday was in line with economists 
expectations it still caused a negative ripple in financial 
markets because traders interpreted it as a sign the fed will feel 
less pressure to lower rates immediately 
most of the revision was attributed to a betterthananticipated 
trade performance the september trade deficit which hit a 
fiveyear low was unavailable when the advance estimate was made 
exports climbed at an annual rate of 16 percent in the third 
quarter compared with an earlier estimate of no change while 
imports grew only 95 percent compared with a 151 percent jump in 
the initial report 
consumer spending was also better than first thought rising at 
a brisk annual rate of 62 percent the strongest since the first 
quarter of 1988 compared with a preliminary estimate of 58 
percent 
inflation as measured by a price index tied to the gnp 
improved dramatically in the third quarter climbing at an annual 
rate of 29 percent after a 50 percent jump in the apriljune 
quarter those figures were unchanged from the advance estimate 
analysts generally expect that the thirdquarter surge in 
consumer spending will not be repeated attributing much of the 
rise to auto purchases spurred by dealer discounts and financing 
incentives 
they also are pessimistic about trade believing that the 
strength in the dollar will stall further improvement in the 
deficit 
in a separate report the commerce department said aftertax 
corporate profits were off a sharp 72 percent in the third 
quarter matching the decline in the second quarter which was the 
worst performance in three years it was the third consecutive 
quarter that profits have dropped the department attributed much 
of the decline to losses from hurricane hugo

a judge declared a mistrial today 
after a jury deadlocked on racketeering charges against three 
avowed revolutionaries already cleared of plotting to overthrow the 
us government 
the ruling by us district judge william young came on the 
jurys 21st day of deliberations in the yearlong trial 
the jury for three days had said it did not think it would be 
able to reach agreement on the racketeering and conspiracy charges 
which involved 15 successful or attempted bombings of courthouses 
banks corporate offices and military recruiting and reserve 
centers one of the bombings at a courthouse in boston in 1976 
cost one man his lower leg some other bombs failed to explode 
it was not immediately clear if a second trial would be held on 
the racketeering charges 
the jury delivered a partial verdict monday acquitting the three 
of sedition or trying to overthrow the government a charge rarely 
used since the civil war the acquittal means the defendants cannot 
be tried again on that charge 
on trial were raymond levasseur his wife patricia gros 
levasseur and richard williams 
they were tried as part of a group operating under the names 
united freedom front and sam melvillejonathan jackson unit which 
they said took responsibility for a string of bombings and bank 
robberies along the east coast from 1976 to 1984 
jurors were deciding racketeering charges against levasseur and 
williams as well as a charge of racketeering conspiracy against all 
three each count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and 20000 
in fines 
originally eight people were indicted but only three were left 
in the trial 
some of the defendants have been convicted at separate trials 
for some of the bombings but the springfield prosecution pulled 
the case together through racketeering laws that allow several 
people to be tried for incidents occurring in several states 
levasseur and williams already are serving long prison terms for 
some of the bombings mrs levasseur is free on bail after serving 
3 years of a fiveyear term for harboring a fugitive her husband

states should be allowed to ban abortions for 
most unmarried girls unless their parents are notified before such 
operations are performed the supreme court was told today 
but challengers to parental notification laws in ohio and 
minnesota countered that the measures unfairly impinged on a girls 
right to abortion as guaranteed by the supreme court in its 1973 
roe vs wade decision 
groups on both sides of the abortion issue looked to the court 
this term to clarify where it stood on roe vs wade but an 
illinois case that promised to be the major barometer of the 
courts intent was settled out of court last week 
the cases argued before the court today dealt not with the 
broad issue of whether abortion should be legal but whether 
parents of minors should be notified if their daughters seek one 
justice sandra day oconnor considered a key vote in both 
notification cases expressed skepticism about the minnesota laws 
requirement that both biological parents of a girl be notified 
before an abortion is performed 
the statute just doesnt provide for any exceptions even when 
its not in the childs best interest she told minnesota chief 
deputy attorney general john tunheim how do you defend the 
states best interest 
tunheim said biological parents are presumed to have rights 
and responsibilities in the upbringing of their children that the 
state should defend 
but janet benshoof representing challengers to the minnesota 
law said the state gave minor girls inadequate protection against 
unfit parents 
she said the law requires notification of a parent who may be 
a mental patient a fugitive who beats the family regularly 
in some cases there are fathers who have been been absent from 
the family for years and the daughter seeking an abortion would 
have to notify him even if he were a complete stranger ms 
benshoof said 
the ohio law requires notification of one parent 
states are entitled to enact laws to aid parents ohio 
assistant attorney general rita eppler argued 
ms eppler urged the justices to reinstate a law she said 
preserves a minors right to abortion while aiding parental 
involvement 
but linda sogg a cleveland lawyer representing those who 
successfully challenged the ohio law in lower courts contended 
ohio really has singled out abortion for the notification 
requirement 
she said young girls seeking medical help for drug abuse or a 
contagious disease face no such parentalnotification requirement 
at issue in both cases are state laws requiring doctors to 
notify parents before performin abortions sought by unmarried girls 
under 18 who are still supported by a parent 
the lawyers in both cases were asked numerous questions by the 
justices during a twohourlong presentation 
as an alternative to parental notification the ohio law allows 
a young girl to try to persuade a judge that she is mature enough 
to make the decision on her own or that telling her parents is not 
in her best interests 
the ohio law says a young girl must prove her maturity by 
clear and convincing evidence 
oconnor asked whether that standard makes it too difficult for 
young girls seeking a judges approval to get an abortion without 
parental notification 
what about the risk of erroneous deprivation of a minors 
right to abortion oconnor asked ms eppler 
but chief justice william h rehnquist noted that both ohio and 
minnesota contend that no socalled judicial bypass alternative to 
parental notificiation is required 
the ohio law represents no undue burden ms eppler said 
adding that the state has a pressing interest in assuring the 
involvement of parents when their daughter faces perhaps the most 
serious dilemma of her young life 
but ms sogg argued not all parents are loving and 
referred to too many statistics about how unloving parents can 
be 
she told the court many young girls who desire abortions have a 
fear of parental retaliation or abuse 
about half the states have laws requiring parental consent but 
most of the laws have been invalidated after court challenges 
nationwide about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teenagers 
who become pregnant each year seek abortions of the 15 million 
legal abortions performed annually since 1973 about 12 percent 
180000 each year have been for minors 
the court touched off a political firestorm in july by voting 
54 to give states greater power to regulate abortions four 
justices appeared ready to go even further and overturn roe vs 
wade oconnor refused 
but she has been critical of the 1973 ruling and has not 
discounted the chance she someday would vote to reverse it 
neither ohio nor minnesota is asking the court to reverse roe 
vs wade but the bush administration has 
although it did not seek to participate in todays arguments 
the bush administration urged the court to use the minnesota case 
to rule that women have no constitutional right to abortion 
we continue to believe that roe was wrongly decided and should 
be overruled justice department lawyers said in a 
friendofthecourt brief 
the disputed ohio law was passed by the state legislature in 
1985 but never took effect due to a successful legal challenge by 
an akron abortion clinic and one of its doctors max pierre gaujean 
the law would have required any doctor asked to perform an 
abortion on an unmarried girl under 18 to contact one of the girls 
parents at least 24 hours before the operation 
a young girl could seek to bypass parental notification by 
seeking a state judges permission to have the abortion 
a federal judge struck down the law and that ruling was upheld 
by the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
the minnesota law requires such young girls to notify both 
biological parents at least 48 hours before obtaining an abortion 
the 1981 law makes doctors criminally liable for violations 
after enforcement of the law was blocked a judicialbypass 
provision took effect it allows a girl to avoid notifying her 
parents by convincing a judge she is mature and capable of giving 
informed consent or that not notifying her parents would be in 
her best interests 
the notification law with the judicialbypass option was in 
effect in minnesota for five years before it was struck down by a 
federal judge 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals reversed that ruling last 
year and said the law is constitutional the appeals court 
however blocked enforcement of the law pending supreme court 
action 
the cases are ohio vs akron center for reproductive health 
88805 and hodgson vs minnesota 881125 and 881309

savings from closing or realigning 15 military bases but the 
eventual amount still will be considerable a congressional agency 
said wednesday 
the general accounting office said that based on revised and 
updated data it found that the annual savings from shutting down or 
scaling back the 15 bases amounted to 4534 million about 170 
million less the 6229 million the commission estimated 
but still a substantial annual savings the gao said 
the congressionally established commission on base realignment 
and closure recommended in january closing a total of 86 military 
bases and scaling back five more a proposal accepted by 
thendefense secretary frank carlucci 
despite overwhelming support in congress for the plan a number 
of lawmakers questioned the commissions methodology and complained 
that its findings were based on faulty data 
members asked this past summer that the gao the investigative 
arm of congress review the commissions work on 15 bases slated 
for closure or realignment including the presidio in california 
fort dix in new jersey and chanute air force base in illinois 
the gao in its report said the commission overestimated the 
savings at the 15 bases because of data errors inaccurate 
estimates and the exclusion of certain relevant costs 
specifically at the jefferson proving ground in indiana the 
commission did not calculate the cost of cleaning up munitions at 
the facility the panel estimated annual savings of 66 million at 
the base and six years to recover the closure costs 
but the gao said that it could take anywhere from 38 to more 
than 200 years to recover the expense of closing jefferson proving 
ground the gao also estimated savings at 63 million annually 
the gao recommended that defense secretary dick cheney closely 
monitor the closing and realignment of the bases which are to be 
completed by sept 30 1995 
the gao said the department of defense provided oral comments on 
a draft of the report which generally agreed with the agencys 
findings although it estimated that the annual savings from the 15 
bases will be about 522 million

police used tear gas and water cannon to 
force back hundreds of young demonstrators wednesday who attacked 
the towering monument to vladimir i lenin at nowa huta in southern 
poland state media reported 
the demonstration called by the radical movement for an 
alternative society targeted the statue that dominates a square in 
nowa huta an industrial city of 220000 people built outside 
krakow in the 1950s to be a model workers community 
according to state tv and the official pap news agency the 
demonstrators used metal bars and hacksaws to begin dismantling 
barriers surrounding the monument to the founder of the soviet 
state before police intervened 
demonstrators shouted chants calling for dismantling the 
monument and the removal of the estimated 40000 soviet troops in 
poland 
the protesters finally dispersed after pleas for moderation from 
solidarity parliament deputy edward nowak who promised to propose 
dismantling of the monument to parliament thursday state tv said 
the 33foottall statue long has been a hated symbol of soviet 
domination in the city a solidarity stronghold which until 1977 
was denied the right to have its own roman catholic church 
last week demonstrators splashed paint on the statue and tried 
to set it ablaze 
in 1979 worker activists dynamited the statue blowing off one 
of its legs it was quickly repaired by communist officials and 
several people were imprisoned in the attack 
the attempt to dismantle lenins statue follows the officially 
sanctioned dismantling of another hated symbol a monument in 
warsaw to felix dzerzhinsky the founder of the soviet secret 
police on nov 17 
city officials agreed to the dismantling of the statue and the 
renaming of dzerzhinski square where it stood saying the statues 
removal was needed in connection with subway construction work 
the solidarityled government has sought to maintain friendly 
relations with the soviet union including a trip to moscow last 
week by prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki he has condemned 
outbreaks of antisoviet vandalism 
but his government has stressed that poland is a sovereign 
country and must no longer be dominated by its larger neighbor

a judge refused to grant a mistrial 
wednesday in a state antipollution lawsuit against amtrak after 
the defense said all of its witnesses would invoke the fifth 
amendment protection against selfincrimination 
circuit judge robert perry gave amtrak attorney edward booth 
until thursday morning to find substitute witnesses the lawyer 
said he plans to rest his case if no one else can be found 
amtrak faces four counts of commercial littering for human waste 
allegedly flushed from trains into the st johns river and rice 
creek a couple fishing under a trestle also testified they were 
sprayed 
booth said his potential witnesses feared their testimony would 
be used by the state attorneys office to support charges against 
them 
im trying to avoid charges ever being brought against these 
people booth told the judge it would form a link in a chain 
of evidence that the state could use it would overwhelmingly 
incriminate them 
the judge said booth should have anticipated the problem 
amtrak contends federal law exempts the national rail passenger 
line from state pollution control laws amtrak says it would be too 
expensive to add holding tanks to the toilets aboard all its trains

two memories of sen joseph mccarthy one from 
historian stephen ambrose one from columnist william f buckley 
are recounted in the december issue of american heritage magazine 
buckley was having lunch with the wisconsin republican on labor 
day 1952 when mccarthy got a phone call from the chairman of the 
republican party in massachusetts 
mccarthy returned to the table looking troubled the caller he 
said wanted him to go to boston and speak on behalf of sen henry 
cabot lodge who was being challenged by john f kennedy the 
democratic nominee 
thats hard to do mccarthy complained joe kennedy jfks 
father has always been on my side and he contributed 5000 to my 
own reelection campaign if i go to boston jack kennedy will lose 
to cabot lodge no doubt about it 
lunch resumed but 15 minutes later mccarthy got up and went to 
the phone when he returned he was smiling 
well i took care of that one all right he said i told 
his manager sure ill give a speech for cabot but hell have to 
ask me to do it he laughed cabot lodge would never ask me 
publicly hed lose the harvard vote 
lodge lost kennedy won 
now ambroses story 
in 1954 mccarthy and aide roy cohn came to the university of 
wisconsin where the senator was to give a speech he was met at 
the airport by ambrose his student host 
he and cohn were drunk ambrose recalls they continued 
drinking from a whiskey bottle as we drove to campus on arrival i 
told the senator he had an hour before his talk i asked if there 
was anything he would like to see 
the card catalog in the library mccarthy replied at the 
library mccarthy flipped straight to the m section and pulled 
out several drawers of cards on books by and about karl marx and 
threw them down on the directors desk 
this is a goddamned outrage mccarthy roared the good 
children of wisconsin shouldnt be exposed to this crap i want all 
these books burned 
instead of arguing the merits of marx or pleading for academic 
freedom the director explained why the books could not be 
summarily torched they were state property 
taken aback by this invocation of so basic a conservative value 
mccarthy relented but insisted that the volumes be locked up with 
the librarys collection of pornography 
ambrose says he checked back a few weeks later the marx books 
were still in circulation

a school district must supply a 
signlanguage interpreter for deaf parents at schoolsponsored 
conferences involving the education of their children a federal 
judge ruled wednesday 
schoolsponsored activities that are designed for parental 
involvement and are focused on the students academic or 
disciplinary progress must be made available to the 
hearingimpaired us district judge gerard goettel wrote 
the case is the first of its kind in the country said marc 
charmatz attorney for the national association for the deaf legal 
defense fund which brought the case he said most school districts 
willingly supply sign language interpreters 
the parents kenneth and karen rothschild have two children who 
can hear normally in the ramapo central school district charmatz 
said one is a fourthgrader and one a high school senior the 
district is in rockland county north and across the hudson river 
from new york city 
since the early 1980s the parents have sought an interpreter so 
they could participate in parentteacher evenings and other 
activities involving their children 
the rothschilds have retained signlanguage interpreters at 
their own expense paying an estimated 2000 through the 198889 
school year according to the decision 
the couple maintained that they are denied equal opportunity to 
participate in school programs and to consult with school district 
personnel concerning their children 
they sought relief under the federal rehabilitation act of 1973 
which says any organization receiving federal aid cannot 
discriminate against the handicapped 
the school district claimed that the parents do not qualify 
under the act because they are not students 
goettel said that the regulations of the act define reasonable 
access for a deaf person as including a signlanguage interpreter 
without the provision of a signlanguage interpreter the 
plaintiffs are de facto barred from the participation in the school 
districts programs for parents goettel wrote this is not a 
case where the relief sought by the plaintiffs would be cumulative 
or duplicative of services they are already receiving 
goettel added however that the districts obligation is 
limited to schoolinitiated conferences incident to the academic 
andor disciplinary aspects of their childs education to the 
extent that the plaintiffs wish to voluntarily participate in any 
of the plethora of extracurricular activities that their children 
may be involved in we think they like other parents must do so 
at their own expense 
attorneys for the school district did not immediately return 
phone calls 
in camden nj a deaf rutgers university law student won a 
court order monday forcing the school to provide her with classroom 
notes 
us district judge stanley s brotman ordered the universitys 
law school not to hold two classes attended by karen prince unless 
she receives notes within 24 hours of each class 
ms prince sued under the same law as the rothschilds

a federal judge has refused to open 
records of the states defunct segregation spy agency to allow a 
prosecutor to examine reports about the 1963 assassination of naacp 
leader medgar evers 
hinds county district attorney ed peters is trying to decide if 
byron de la beckwith whose first two trials on charges of killing 
evers ended in mistrials should be tried again 
in an order made public tuesday us district judge william h 
barbour jr ruled it would be premature to grant prosecutors access 
to the closed records of the state sovereignty commission 
peters sought access to the records to determine if there was 
jury tampering in the two 1964 trials of beckwith a former 
greenwood fertilizer salesman accused of killing evers beckwith 
now lives in tennessee 
mistrials were declared in both trials when allwhite hinds 
county juries failed to reach verdicts 
a hinds county grand jury that meets dec 11 is expected to 
explore whether to bring new charges 
the decision of the district attorney as to whether to try 
beckwith again should be based on whether he thinks the evidence 
available to him at this time is sufficient to obtain a 
conviction barbour wrote in the new ruling barbour also wrote 
that evidence of jury tampering would not be admissible in any new 
murder trial 
the sovereignty commission created by the 1956 legislature 
infiltrated and harassed civil rights groups it went out of 
existence in 1973 when its funding was cut off 
the 1977 legislature sealed the agencys records until 2027 
barbour ruled july 27 the records should be open to the public but 
allowed them to remain sealed pending appeals to the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals 
published reports have been that the commission screened 
potential jurors before beckwiths second trial in april 1964 
evers was shot to death outside his jackson home june 12 1963 
beckwiths rifle was found nearby and one of his fingerprints was 
on the rifle sight but beckwith testified the gun had been stolen 
from him 
barbour said he might later reconsider peters request for the 
records 
the district attorney argues that if he attempts to retry 
beckwith that beckwith will argue that such retrial would be 
barred by his constitutional right to a speedy trial barbour 
wrote 
while prosecutors plan to respond that proof of jury tampering 
would make it possible to retry the case the judge wrote this 
argument is premature and may be renewed if the district attorney 
decides to retry beckwith and if beckwith raises the speedy trial 
issue

christian militias that have opposed gen 
michel aoun said wednesday they would join him in fighting the 
troops tanks and artillery syria is massing around lebanons 
christian enclave 
elias hrawi the new christian president backed by syria 
dismissed aoun as army commander tuesday and ordered him to leave 
his command post in a bunker beneath the presidential palace in 
baabda east of beirut 
aoun claims hrawis election by parliament last week was 
unconstitutional says he wont accept a new peace plan until the 
syrian occupation army leaves the country and has refused to 
turn over the shellbattered palace 
lebanons largest christian militia the lebanese forces said 
it would fight beside the 20000 christian troops who followed aoun 
through a sixmonth artillery war with the syrians earlier this 
year 
the phalange party the main rightwing christian political 
force and also a foe of aoun pledged to confront any attempt to 
storm the 310squaremile christian enclave north and east of 
beirut 
thirtythree members of the french parliament met with aoun in 
a show of support that contradicted the official french government 
stand the legislators joined thousands of young men who have 
formed a human shield around the palace 
one of the lawmakers bernard bosson said he was amazed at 
the flood of masses at the palace and declared this is like 
the peoples movement in eastern europe asking for democracy 
france supports hrawi who is trying to strengthen his central 
government and reunite the fractured military as part of an effort 
to end the 14yearold sectarian civil war in which more than 
150000 people have been killed 
christians have dominated the government army and judiciary 
since lebanon became independent of france in 1943 
residents of chtoura an east lebanon market town on the 
damascusbeirut road said wednesday afternoon that scores of 122mm 
and 133mm syrian artillery pieces were moving toward beirut and the 
central mountains above baabda followed by dozens of trucks filled 
with ammunition 
they said hundreds of empty trucks were heading back toward 
syria apparently after unloading soldiers and equipment 
earlier the residents reported seeing at least 15000 soldiers 
in 800 trucks roll into lebanon through the bekaa valley between 
monday night and midday tuesday along with 90 tanks 120 field 
guns mineclearing tanks armored personnel carriers and 
ammunition trucks 
both christian and moslem military sources said syria had 
sovietdesigned t55 tanks arrayed on the line that separates 
moslem west beirut from the capitals christian sector 
larger t62 tanks formed an arch of fire pointed at aouns 
troops in souk elgharb a mountaintop town that commands the main 
routes to baabda 
a christian source said they are in combat formation it 
seems they are only waiting for the orders its a significant 
buildup the kind of measures that precede a major battle 
samir geagea commander of the lebanese forces militia said 
i ordered our forces last night to be ready to link up with their 
comrades of the lebanese army in defense of the liberated areas 
a reference to the 30 percent of lebanon free of syrian troops 
syria has 40000 soldiers regularly stationed in lebanon under a 
peacekeeping mandate from the arab league issued in 1976 the year 
after the civil war began the arab league arranged a ceasefire 
sept 22 in the battle between aoun and the syrians in which 
nearly 1000 civilians were killed 
aouns soldiers drove the 6000 lebanese forces militiamen from 
east beirut in a power struggle that culminated in a 4day 
confrontation in february that killed 82 people and wounded 200 
a statement from the phalange party said this is the hour for 
mobilizing all potential without exception to face any attempt to 
storm the christian area we shall be in the forward defense 
lines 
the phalange and aoun parted company on the the peace plan 
worked out by lebanese legislators worked out in october at taif 
saudi arabia the phalange supports the plan but aoun rejected it 
because it did not include a fixed timetable for syrian withdrawal 
from lebanon 
information minister edmond rizk a phalangist said in an 
appeal to aoun on tuesday we all ask you to prove that you 
really love lebanon allow peace to prevail you must rest and 
let the nation rest 
a christian military source said aouns forces had planted 
thousands of antitank and antipersonnel mines in valleys that 
separate the christian enclave from syrian positions

president bush on wednesday talked by 
telephone with west german chancellor helmut kohl about kohls 
plans for german reunification as secretary of state james a baker 
iii outlined a fourpoint us stand on the divided country 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwaer told reporters that bush 
and kohl had discussed the chancellors plan and that they also had 
talked about bushs upcoming summit meeting with soviet president 
mikhail s gorbachev 
the spokesman said he had no details of the conversation 
we note that chancellor kohl is responding to the deepest 
aspirations of his people said fitzwater this is a goal that 
we and the federal republic of germany have long held in terms of 
german unity 
baker told reporters at a presummit news conference that the 
us position on german reunification should essentially embrace 
four principles 
they are 
the people of east and west germany should decide for 
themselves whether they want unity and what form it should take 
a reunified germany should be a member of the north atlantic 
treaty organization and the european economic community 
any steps toward reunification should be peaceful gradual 
and part of a stepbystep process to preserve european stability 
any change of borders in europe should be made according to the 
1975 helsinki accords which specify that frontiers can be changed 
only peacefully 
we really shouldnt endorse or exclude any particular vision 
of unity baker said unity can mean a lot of things it can 
mean a single federal state it can mean a confederation or it 
could mean something else 
there have been suggestions that a reunited germany might be 
neutral with west germany withdrawing from nato and east germany 
from the warsaw pact 
but baker said the united states opposes such a west german 
withdrawal from the western community 
there should be no trade of neutralism for unity and there 
should be no dilution of the federal republic of germanys liberal 
democratic character he said 
baker noted that kohl had not mentioned changing borders some 
rightwing political forces in west germany have called for 
reclaiming traditional german areas that have been in the soviet 
union and in poland since world war ii 
i think we should reiterate our support for the principles of 
the helsinki final act recognizing the inviolability of frontiers 
in europe and allowing for the possibility of change in those 
borders only through peaceful means he said 
baker was asked whether he thought a europewide conference 
should be held to consider the german question 
he said he thought the 35 nations involving eastern and 
western europe the soviet union the united states and canada 
that signed the helsinki accords all have a very firm and 
definite interest in what happens with respect to the question of 
unification 
but he said the focus should be first on what is meant by 
unification because the word means different things to different 
people

an east german economic recovery like the one 
that transformed warravaged west germany into one of the worlds 
richest nations hangs on the fate of a crudely minted 
featherweight coin 
east germanys aluminum ostmark is nonconvertible abroad and 
quickly losing its value at home due to a dearth of goods and a 
free fall on illegal exchange markets 
west german financial experts consider currency reform to be a 
crucial first step toward a convertible ostmark and economic 
recovery 
but even the most committed reformers in the communist state 
have so far resisted the idea of forcing a nation nurtured on 
socialist promises of security to endure the draconian transition 
to a currency of real value 
east germans have 84 billion stashed in savings banks the 
equivalent of more than 5000 for every man woman and child in 
the nation 
that poses a massive threat of inflation as well testifying to 
a chronic lack of anything desireable to buy in east germany 
price controls have to be removed or drastically reduced to 
bring the cost of goods in line with the cost of their production 
economists on both sides agree but prices would skyrocket if state 
controls were lifted while so much cash is at the ready 
western economists therefore recommend a currency reform or 
replacement of the longdisdained ostmarks with a new currency that 
people will respect 
whatever else needs to be done hinges on a currency reform 
said liane launhardt a senior economist with west germanys 
commerzbank we feel it is pivotal for introducing market 
economic elements and getting important projects off the ground 
she described the move as bitter potion that no one in east 
germany wants to swallow but like other western economists said 
widespread unrest will be unleashed if runaway inflation results 
from attempted halfmeasures 
how soon a currency reform could be implemented depends on how 
long it takes to accept economic reform as the way out of the 
current crisis said norbert walter spokesman for deutsche bank 
west germanys largest financial institution 
deutsche bank president alfred herrhausen predicts east germans 
could enjoy the same living standards as west germany in five to 10 
years if they quickly come to grips with the nationwide sacrifices 
needed in the interim 
west germanys postwar recovery was achieved in large part 
because of the 1948 currency reform that replaced the inflated 
reichmarks with deutschmarks at a rate of 101 
the measure immediately infused confidence in the currency and 
put an end to the cigarette economy where food and other 
necessities were valued in american tobacco 
but it devastated the personal wealth of most germans in the 
occupied western sectors and inflicted harsh sacrifice on those 
without property and other tangible assets 
the east german government is not prepared to wipe out private 
cash reserves deliberately said finance ministry spokesman franz 
koeckerbauer 
we dont consider it necessary he said we are trying to 
encourage citizens to have confidence in the financial system and 
such measures would run counter to that aim 
east germanys new finance minister uta nickel has likewise 
brushed off western suggestions that subsidies be drastically 
reduced in the transition to marketrelated pricing 
changes to the practice of subsidies must be considered with 
all caution ms nickel told the labor newspaper tribuene 
everyone is now criticizing the subsidies as if they hadnt been 
enjoying them for years 
the views being expressed by east german and west german 
economists on the need for currency reform reflect the sensitive 
political situation complicating recovery 
communists have held power since the east german state was 
founded in the sovietoccupied sector of defeated germany in 1949 
and to suddenly advocate measures undertaken by west germany four 
decades ago would be tantamount to an admission of political errors 
the communists face challenges to their continued rule both from 
unrecognized opposition movements and from the smaller political 
parties they have been aligned with for 40 years 
east germany needs a new and moresecure political system in 
place before it can seriously tackle economic measures of the 
magnitude of a currency reform and convertibility according to 
manfred milzer of the west berlinbased german institute for 
economic research 
but time is running against restraint especially since east 
germans have been allowed to travel freely to the west 
untold thousands have smuggled out their excess currency and 
traded it as low as 20 ostmarks to one west german mark flooding 
the illegal market to the point that free traders will no longer 
buy the east german currency at any price 
jochen zimmermann head of berliner banks foreign exchange 
division said estimates run as high as 16 billion on the amount 
of east german currency traded illegally in the west by tourists 
wanting funds for weekend shopping sprees 
ms nickel the finance minister has proposed a value of 44 
ostmarks per west german mark as an internal conversion rate to 
provide tourists with travel money 
but no realistic rate has been mentioned in east berlin as a 
target for eventual convertibility to hard currencies 
internal reforms like replacement of the ostmark are viewed as 
necessary to even start aiming for conversion said berliner banks 
zimmermann 
noting that initial west german offers of assistance have been 
rebuffed as interference zimmermann said a convertible currency is 
clearly a long way off

govan mbeki received an honorary 
doctorate degree from the university of the western cape on 
wednesday the first leader of the outlawed african national 
congress to be so honored in south africa 
we live in exciting and disturbing times when much of the 
world seems to be in the process of renewal mbeki said after 
receiving the philosophy doctorate from the universitys 
chancellor anglican archbishop desmond tutu 
we are fortunate that this happens on the eve of our own 
liberation mbeki said south africa should draw on the 
experiences of other countries and tap the african experience so 
that what we build does not repeat the mistakes that the sister 
peoples on our continent have made he added 
although he argued that capitalism was the foundation for 
apartheid mbeki challenged the view expressed in some circles 
that genuine democracy would result in the masses descending on the 
economy like a swarm of rapacious locusts eating up everything in 
their path without regard to the vital question of persuing an 
economic policy that would guarantee growth and development 
mbekis imprisoned colleague nelson mandela sent a message of 
congratulations that was read by his wife winnie 
this is the first time a south african university will honor a 
redhot freedom fighter who has spent years in prison and has 
emerged from that harsh experience with his convictions 
unscathed the message said 
mrs mandela received a standing ovation from the audience of 
about 1000 as she took the stage to read her husbands words 
earlier this year black antiapartheid leaders had distanced 
themselves from mrs mandela accusing her of complicity in the 
death of a teenage activist and her bodyguards of conducting a 
reign of terror in the johannesburg township of soweto 
since the men imprisoned for life with her husband in 1964 were 
freed last month she had made several appearances with them 
mandela is the only one of the group still imprisoned for sabotage 
and plotting to overthrow the government 
mbeki 79 was freed in 1987 after 24 years in jail after 
holding two news conferences at which he declared he believed in 
the actions for which he was sentenced and remained a member of the 
outlawed anc and the south african communist party he was 
prohibited from making public appearances or statements until his 
restrictions were lifted last month 
mbeki the son of a xhosa tribal chief earned university 
degrees in education and economics before he helped found the ancs 
military wing he worked as a teacher journalist store owner and 
union organizer while in prison he earned an advanced degree in 
economics by correspondence course and was awarded an honorary 
doctorate in social science by the university of amsterdam for his 
book the peasant revolt

state officials want to know why majestic 
birds of prey capable of spotting a mouse from aircraft altitudes 
fly straight into the whirling blades of windmills at the altamont 
pass energy farm 
since 1986 a total of 99 eagles falcons hawks and owls have 
been killed at the farms thousands of 40foot windmills 
considered one of the most environmentally safe ways to generate 
electricity 
the california energy commission is spending 120000 to find 
out why 
these birds may have the sharpest eyes but they dont 
necessarily have the biggest brains said susan orloff a senior 
wildlife biologist with biosystems analysis inc the tiburon 
company hired to do the study 
at this point we really dont know why theyre doing this 
orloff said 
altamont pass with 6700 windmills sprouting like steel daisies 
over 80 square miles along interstate 580 near livermore is the 
worlds largest and most productive wind farm 
california produces more than 90 percent of the worlds 
windgenerated electricity and altamont is the largest of the 
states six wind farms together they produce enough power for a 
city the size of san jose 
the pass is also a traditional migratory path where birds of 
prey hunt for food during their flight down the states central 
valley to winter in mexico 
the state energy commission study administered by contra costa 
alameda and solano counties is being conducted during the spring 
fall and winter seasons at altamont pass five biosystems analysis 
biologists are counting birds and studying their behavior every day 
at the farm 
they speculate the birds despite their sharp vision may be 
mistaking the windmills for trees they may also be concentrating 
so intently on their prey that they dont see the whirling blades 
orloff said 
researchers are experimenting with ways to deter the birds 
possibly using noise or painting the windmills a bright color 
local ordinances however aimed at preventing eyesores prevent 
windmill operators from painting the windmills 
mike deangelis manager of the state energy commissions 
research and development office said he doubts that any of those 
ideas will work if this is a problem its going to remain a 
problem he said 
us wind power which operates nearly half the windmills at 
altamont pass also has hired a biologist to study ways of stopping 
the deaths said lori adams a business development associate for 
the company 
its really a shame that this happens and wed like to do 
what we can to make sure it doesnt happen at all said adams 
the company has built roosts on power line poles to keep the 
birds from electrocuting themselves by sitting on lines and has 
developed a manual to help field workers handle accidents 
it also contributes money to a shelter in stockton for injured 
birds of prey

the american civil liberties union asked 
congress wednesday to investigate attorney general dick 
thornburghs decision leading to dismissal of the irancontra case 
against a former cia station chief 
there is a strong possibility thornburghs action regarding 
joseph fernandez stemmed in part from the cias desire to cover 
up its involvement in the irancontra affair morton halperin 
director of the aclus washington office said in a statement 
a week ago thornburgh filed an affidavit blocking disclosure of 
classified information relating to the location of three cia 
facilities in central america and details of three agency programs 
in costa rica thornburgh was acting on behalf of us intelligence 
agencies 
us district court judge claude hilton threw out the criminal 
charges aganst fernandez on friday saying the cias exstation 
chief in costa rica needed to use the classified information in 
order to get a fair trial the office of independent counsel 
lawrence walsh is appealing 
in a session with reporters wednesday thornburgh said he 
expected the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond will 
allow the trial to go forward by overturning hiltons refusal to 
allow substitutions for the classified information 
thornburgh refused to discuss the information when asked if it 
revealed cia involvement in covert aid to nicaraguan rebels as 
claimed by fernandez 
these are troublesome areas thornburgh said noting that 
when he headed the criminal division of the justice department in 
the ford administration he revoked an order giving the cia power to 
determine who could be prosecuted within their organization 
i found that to be unthinkable thats a decision that has to 
be made by prosecutors in the department of justice 
cia director william webster answering questions after a 
luncheon speech wednesday at the national press club was asked if 
the cia were trying to protect fernandez he replied thats 
absolutely without merit 
halperin in a letter to congress said congress should 
investigate whether the attorney general acted properly in refusing 
to release information required to allow the trial to go forward 
it went to the leadership of the senate and house intelligence 
committees and judiciary committees 
this case gives the appearance of a conflict of interest 
the letter stated 
neither the bush administration represented by the attorney 
general nor the intelligence community had an interest in seeing 
this case go to trial said the letter 
the intelligence community may have been much more interested 
in protecting fernandez and its relationship with him than in 
protecting vital national security secrets the letter added 
the case against fernandez was being handled by walshs office 
and the attorney general had no stake in the prosecution said 
halperin 
the attorney general appears simply to have followed the 
dictates of the intelligence agencies in refusing to disclose the 
information the letter stated 
in filing the unprecedented affidavit thornburgh invoked a 
provision of the classified information procedures act the law 
requires the attorney general to report to congress in all cases 
where the prosecution cannot proceed because the government bars 
disclosure of classified information 
it was sent to sens david boren dokla and william cohen 
rmaine of the senate intelligence committee boren is chairman 
and cohen is vice chairman the letter also was sent to sen joseph 
biden ddel chairman of the senate judiciary committee and sen 
strom thurmond rsc ranking minority member of the judiciary 
committee 
the letter also was sent to rep anthony beilenson dcalif 
chairman of the house intelligence committee and us reps jack 
brooks dtexas and hamilton fish rny brooks is chairman of 
the house judiciary committee and fish is a judiciary committee

the number of prostitutes on the citys 
streets has dropped dramatically in the past few weeks as the 
number of unsolved killings of young women has grown to 13 police 
say 
seven bodies of young women have been found in the rochester 
area in the past two months the most recent victim was elizabeth 
a gibson 29 whose body was found monday by a hunter on 
thanksgiving day the body of june stotts also 29 was discovered 
in rochesters genesee river gorge 
of the 13 unsolved slayings in the rochester area in the past 
two years police have identified all but three of the victims as 
prostitutes another prostitute has been missing since early 
november 
rochester police say that solving the killings is their top 
priority but no arrests have been made and they have refused to 
comment on whether they have any suspects 
i think the murders will continue until the killer or 
killers are found deputy chief terrence rickard said this week he 
said there may be at least three killers responsible for the deaths 
many of the citys prostitutes fear they are being stalked by a 
serial killer 
im scared to death said debra a 24yearold prostitute 
as she paced nervously on a corner north of downtown recently if 
it wasnt for my drug habit i wouldnt be here anyway 
rickard said the number of prostitutes working the citys 
streets has declined dramatically since midnovember debra said 
she tries to stay off the street as much as possible but sometimes 
you cant help it 
sister eileen conheady a nun who has worked for years with 
prostitutes said she has been to the funerals of some of the 
victims and talked with their friends 
the next day ive seen them back on the street she said 
sister conheady said public attention to the string of deaths 
was slow in coming because prostitutes are considered the most 
disposable of people 
why has it taken so many deaths to arouse our attention she 
said people think they can take out violence on them because 
theyre not worth anything 
on weekend nights nearly as many police cars as prostitutes 
cruise lyell avenue a strip of liquor stores pizza joints and 
neonlit bars just a few blocks from the genesee river gorge eight 
of the victims have been found along the gorge within a few miles 
of one another 
debra said the officers are all over the neighborhood telling 
the prostitutes to stay off the streets 
yvette 20 who did not want her last name used said police 
follow prostitutes on their tricks it makes her feel safer she 
said 
she said she has started carrying a knife if someone tries to 
do something to me ill hurt them 
at least four of the victims were strangled or choked one was 
shot two were beaten to death and one was hit by a car while 
fleeing an attacker police have not determined the cause of death 
of the five other victims 
rickard said solving crimes involving prostitutes is complicated 
because many of them are transitory they come to rochester and 
work for a while then leave with few clues after they are arrested 
or get into trouble he said

in the latest disclosure of alleged 
corruption in the top communist ranks newspapers wednesday said 
that the former premier of east germany turned a park into a 
private estate 
the communist leadership that took over last month has launched 
a campaign to expose abuses by former party officials who could 
face prosecution the aim is to improve the embattled partys image 
and restore its credibility 
the official communist party newspaper neues deutschland 
reported that willi stoph the former premier lived surrounded 
by western luxury on an estate containing several houses fruit 
plantations and an indoor pool he employed servants including 
three gardeners the newspaper said 
stoph who was fired from the politburo resigned as premier on 
nov 7 
the trade union newspaper tribuene said the estate was located 
within a protected wildlife area on which stoph built roads to 
carry his family and guests in volvo sedans when he didnt use a 
helicopter 
the report said the estate contained more than 10 large 
refrigerators filled with food imported from the west along with 
hundreds of bottles of the finest imported wine 
stoph left the estate after he lost his posts neues deutschland 
said taking his most beloved furniture and other things with a 
truck 
tribuene said the house looked like it had been left in 
panic 
neither newspaper gave stophs whereabouts 
the party commission investigating corruption allegations said 
wednesday it will turn over its findings to judicial officials 
the official news agency adn said the commission recommended 
that the partys central committee expel former nonvoting 
politburo member gerhard mueller the report did not elaborate 
the agency also said three officials expelled from the party in 
the 1950s had been rehabilitated and that the expulsions of other 
former leaders were being reviewed 
also on wednesday the communistdominated trade union 
federation expelled former chief harry tisch he was removed from 
the ruling politburo this month for allegedly abusing his powers 
the lavish lifestyles of top party officials have been a major 
source of discontent in a country where the average citizen has to 
wait 10 years or more for a car 
since taking over from ousted hardline leader erich honecker on 
oct 18 egon krenz has begun a program of sweeping reforms that 
includes promises of free elections and abolition of the 
communists 40year monopoly of power 
krenz himself has moved from the exclusive residential compound 
of wandlitz just north of east berlin to a modest house in the 
city 
the wooded walledin compound has been home to highranking 
communist party members tribuene said several former politburo 
members and two current ones still live in wandlitz but that it 
would be turned into a rehabilitation center honecker is among 
those still living in the compound 
neues deutschland said the communist party had ordered that a 
special shop in wandlitz be emptied of rare westernmade consumer 
goods such as video recorders 
the communist party has blamed honecker and former economy chief 
guenter mittag for east germanys economic crisis and has begun a 
disciplinary investigation of them mittag already has been kicked

israeli vice premier shimon peres praised 
the polish government on wednesday for offering to help move a 
roman catholic convent located on the edge of the auschwitz 
concentration camp 
peres said the government had offered land and financial support 
to build a new convent for the carmelite nuns living in an 
abandoned theater used by the nazis as a storehouse during world 
war ii 
i appreciate the position taken by the polish government 
peres said i was told the polish government offered land and 
financial support and they expect the catholic church to do the 
rest 
the presence of the convent at the camp where up to 25 million 
jews were murdered by the nazis is considered deeply offensive to 
jews and severely strained jewishcatholic relations 
tension mounted earlier this year when the roman catholic church 
failed to honor a 1987 agreement to move the convent under 
pressure from the vatican primate jozef glemp in september pledged 
to move the convent 
i do not see why this carmelite monastery should hang like a 
cloud on our relations peres said 
peres visited the former concentration camp wednesday on the 
final day of a threeday visit to poland during which poland said 
it would restore full diplomatic relations with israel early next 
year 
foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski on monday informed peres 
of warsaws decision to restore relations with israel broken off 22 
years ago 
peres also met with solidarity leader lech walesa and said he 
had invited the union leader to israel 
walesa told peres we should tighten our cooperation poland 
is pursuing reforms in these reforms your participation is 
indispensable 
a major aim of peres visit was to improve economic cooperation 
polish trade with israel will amount to 40 million this year 
compared with 223 million last year 
walesa also evoked the common history of the two peoples who 
existed together for centuries in poland 
let us remember this was a country of two peoples the war 
destroyed the jewish people and to this day we feel the shortage 
walesa said 
poland had the largest jewish population in eastern europe until 
the holocaust claimed 3 million of polands 35 million jews with 
nearly all the rest emigrating after world war ii 
there has been a steady warming in relations between the two 
countries in recent years with senior israeli and polish officials 
cultural figures and private groups exchanging visits 
except for romania all warsaw pact nations severed diplomatic 
relations with israel following the 1967 middle east war

customs agents detected what they thought was 
a bomb in a suitcase headed for a colombian airliner wednesday and 
a bomb squad blew it up but analysis of the debris revealed the 
luggage contained a video game 
it wasnt an explosive device it was a nintendo game 
police lt helen kidder said after experts examined the smashed 
remains 
customs officials will reimburse the owners of the destroyed 
suitcase police said 
drug traffickers have waged a campaign of bombings and 
assassinations in colombia in retaliation for stepped up efforts to 
curtail their business and concern was heightened with mondays 
crash of an avianca airlines plane 
all 107 people aboard the plane were killed when it exploded 
this week near bogota and initial reports later dismissed by 
investigators blamed the crash on terrorists 
this got more publicity because of the avianca jet 
explosion police officer bill frio said after wednesdays scare 
customs agents xraying luggage checked in early wednesday at 
los angeles international airport spotted what appeared to be 
sticks of dynamite wiring and a clock inside a large heavy 
suitcase destined for an avianca flight to bogota the plane had 
not yet arrived 
a police bomb squad put the suitcase and an explosive charge 
inside a protective canister and set off the charge to blow up the 
luggage and detonate any explosive it might contain 
what they saw was what they believed to be an explosive 
device our bomb squad acted on that information and we exploded it 
in the canister said frio 
a new york spokeswoman for avianca colombias national airline 
said security had been tightened since mondays crash 
there is no confirmation on what caused the downing of that 
jet spokeswoman cecelia battista said security has always 
been tight but it is even tighter now

the communistcontrolled 
parliament on wednesday swiftly ended the partys 40year monopoly 
on power in a frantic effort to satisfy the demands of the growing 
prodemocracy movement 
a member of the ruling communist politburo said the first free 
elections in four decades could be held within a year 
voting with the somber mechanical gestures born of decades of 
rubberstamp approval of communist measures the 309 deputies 
unanimously scrapped article 4 of the constitution which mandated 
the leading role of the communist party they also deleted a clause 
that bases all education on marxismleninism 
the revolution is proceeding much quicker than we expected 
said jiri dienstbier spokesman for the civic forum opposition 
minutes after the vote was broadcast live on national television 
the changes were among historic concessions the opposition won 
from the communist government on tuesday when premier ladislav 
adamec also promised to form a new government including 
noncommunists by sunday 
they followed 11 straight days of huge antigovernment 
demonstrations which culminated in a twohour strike on monday in 
which millions of workers participated 
adamec went on national tv and said he had asked civic forum for 
its suggestions on who to include in the new government he also 
said he would negotiate a reassessment of the 1968 warsaw pact 
invasion that crushed reforms 
civic forum proposed that the new defense minister be a civilian 
communist and the interior minister who controls the police be a 
civilian noncommunist dienstbier said 
parliament also eliminated the communists leading position in 
the national front an umbrella organization embracing all 
political parties and social groups allowed in czechoslovakia four 
deputies opposed the measure and 16 abstained 
shortly after the historic votes state tv showed slovak actor 
milan knazko announcing word of the changes to a packed national 
theater in bratislava capital of slovakia the entire audience 
which included prominent dissident vaclav havel rose to its feet 
in thunderous minutelong applause 
parliament also planned to consider creating a constitutional 
court and a commission to investigate allegations of police 
brutality in a crackdown on protesters nov 17 
the removal of the requirement that marxismleninism be the 
guiding principle of education was a prime demand of students who 
staged the nov 17 protest and have led the prodemocracy movement 
since 
in parliamentary debate broadcast live on tv for the first 
time deputies openly admitted past party failures and said the 
communists must work hard to win the peoples confidence 
we have betrayed the trust of the electorate and whatever 
laws we pass today will not change this said blanka hykova of 
the socialist party until recently a docile ally of the communists 
anton blazej dean of a communist party training academy said 
we have misunderstood the leading role of the party and its 
position we must regain this trust 
defense minister milan vaclavik a member of parliament sounded 
a cautionary note i am aware that neither the army nor the party 
have the best position now we should be aware that retreats and 
compromises are necessary but there are limits 
alois indra who said tuesday he was quitting as parliament 
president delivered a formal speech of resignation to the 
350member chamber 
he described the resignation as a logical step in the context 
of the present developments 
indra was said to be among party leaders who requested the 
sovietled invasion of august 1968 that crushed the prague 
spring of reform instituted by alexander dubcek then communist 
party chief 
bretislav nedbalek secretary of a preparatory committee said

a deadlocked jury prompted a judge to 
declare a mistrial wednesday in the racketeering case of three 
1970s radicals two days after they were cleared of charges of 
plotting to overthrow the government 
us district judge william young granted a defense motion for a 
mistrial after the jury announced for the third straight day it was 
unable to decide whether the groups alleged bombing exploits 
constituted racketeering 
prosecutors claim raymond levasseur his wife patricia and 
richard williams were part of a group operating under the names 
united freedom front and sam melvillejonathan jackson unit that 
took responsibility for a string of bombings and bank robberies 
along the east coast from 1976 to 1984 
one of the bombings at a courthouse in boston in 1976 cost one 
man his lower leg some other bombs failed to explode 
raymond levasseur and williams already are serving lengthy terms 
for convictions in connection with some of the bombings 
levasseurs wife is free on bail after serving 3 years of a 
fiveyear term for harboring a fugitive her husband 
young set a hearing jan 5 in boston at which time the 
government will decide whether to retry the racketeering conspiracy 
charges 
defense attorney elizabeth fink called for an end to the 
proceedings 
what we ask is that everybody call us attorney wayne budd 
that everybody call the department of justice and ask that this 
farce this fiasco be stopped fink said 
assistant us attorney michael loucks declined to comment after 
the mistrial was declared 
on monday after 19 days of deliberations in the yearlong trial 
jurors delivered a partial verdict acquitting the trio of seditious 
conspiracy to overthrow the us government at the time jurors 
said they seriously doubted they could reach agreement on the 
racketeering charges 
the defendants had no visible reaction as the mistrial was 
announced but immediately handed out a prepared statement claiming 
the government had suffered a significant loss 
we commend the courage of the jury in the face of a very 
vindictive and politically motivated prosecution the statement 
said 
jurors had already cleared mrs levasseur of racketeering and 
were deciding the same charge against the two men as well as a 
charge of racketeering conspiracy against all three each count 
carries a maximum penalty of 20 years and 20000 in fines 
the racketeering charges include 15 successful or attempted 
bombings of courthouses banks corporate offices and military 
recruiting and reserve centers 
originally eight people were indicted some charges were later 
dropped and other defendants have been convicted in separate trials 
on some of the bombings the springfield prosecution pulled the 
case together through racketeering laws that allow several people 
to be tried for incidents occurring in several states

the nuclear industry on wednesday applauded 
the energy departments decision to sue nevada over its refusal to 
allow construction of a highlevel nuclear waste dump nevadas 
governor said were not going to be influenced by threats 
the department announced tuesday night it would give nevada 30 
days to grant the environmental permits needed to study the 
proposed dump site at yucca mountain after that the justice 
department will take the state to court deputy secretary henson 
moore told a nuclear industry meeting in san francisco 
gov bob miller said wednesday the state would not back down 
from its opposition to the dump which would entomb tons of 
radioactive wastes for 10000 years 
were not going to be influenced by threats when we have 
already taken conclusive and decisive action in expressing our 
opposition to the dump miller said in a telephone interview 
they want us to take this like a dose of castor oil he 
said but this isnt castor oil they want us to swallow this is 
poison 
nevada has fought the project since congress declared in 1987 
that yucca mountain situated about 100 miles northwest of las 
vegas would be the only site considered for a dump earlier this 
year the nevada legislature passed a bill prohibiting the federal 
government from placing any highlevel nuclear waste in the state 
moore said the department had given up trying to persuade miller 
to drop his states opposition to the project 
court is not our preferred course of action but enough is 
enough moore said 
moore also announced that energy secretary james d watkins had 
decided after lengthy review of the yucca mountain project that all 
subsurface testing of the site would be put off for two years 
that in combination with other changes in the project means the 
dump will not open before 2010 moore said 
the department originally planned to the open the dump by 1998 
last year it pushed the target date back to 2003 but failure to 
complete surfacebased testing and nevadas refusal to grant 
environmental permits has forced a further delay 
nuclear industry groups cheered moores announcement despite 
the fact that it pushes back by seven years the date when utilities 
can get rid of the tons of highlevel waste they have been 
temporarily storing at reactor sites for three decades 
the announced delay in the completion of the waste repository 
is regrettable said the us council for energy awareness the 
nuclear industrys main lobby group but the important thing is 
that doe has a plan that puts us on a path toward resolving the 
administrative and political problems 
the edison electric institute the trade group of investorowned 
electric utilities said it was pleased that watkins had developed 
a plan to revitalize the project 
we have long recognized that the repository would be delayed 
we just hope that the new schedule is realistic said david 
swanson the groups senior vice president 
moores announcement also brings to the fore a related dispute 
between the state and federal governments over whether to build an 
interim dump for nuclear waste 
the interim facility originally was proposed for tennessee but 
the state fought the project and congress ordered a special 
commission to recommend how to proceed the commission earlier this 
month told congress that some form of interim storage was needed 
because of uncertainty about opening the nevada dump but it made 
no recommendation on where the interim facility should be built 
moore said the department would press congress for legislation 
to build an interim facility 
moore also announced that watkins had sent to the white house a 
suggested nominee to be director of the civilian nuclear waste 
management office which has been without a permanent director for 
two years department officials on wednesday declined to identify 
the proposed nominee but congressional and other sources have said 
it is john bartlett a former nuclear engineeering executive 
jacqueline johnson a department spokesman said bartlett has 
been hired as a consultant to watkins on waste management 
issues she declined to elaborate

rapid change in eastern europe has created a 
new and uncertain era where hope for the demise of communist 
systems is accompanied by dangerous instability cia director 
william webster said wednesday 
as the hard edges of the world recede the threats we face 
have become more numerous more diffuse and more difficult to 
define webster said in a speech to the national press club 
he said intelligence that concentrates on counting soviet 
military forces and tracing moscows influence around the world is 
giving way to the need to spy on drug traffickers assess third 
world conflicts and verify armscontrol treaties 
moves in eastern europe will open new economic opportunities for 
the west he said but those moves also represent the most 
immediate threat to internal political stability the reformers 
face stiff odds because of the need for economic austerity 
measures that will bring popular unrest he said 
as the soviet grip on its satellites loosens the central 
intelligence agency and spy services of us allies agree that 
moscows own intelligence activities around the world are growing 
webster said 
around the world our stations are reporting more aggressive 
action a more robst intelligencecollection effort more efforts 
to recruit our embassy and intelligence personnel than we have seen 
in a long time he said 
many of the moves appear aimed at stealing us or allied 
technology he said as less money is dedicated to that 
particular effort inside the soviet union more and more effort 
needs to be applied to obtain that kind of technology through 
clandestine means and thats what were experiencing 
much of his speech appeared to be a plea to head off budget cuts 
for the cia and other intelligence agencies in the government as 
the pentagon in whose budget most intelligence operations are 
hidden prepares for substantial cuts in the next few years 
while the precise figures are secret us intelligence 
reportedly spends 25 billion to 30 billion a year just under 10 
percent of the defense budget he conceded that intelligence after 
receiving substantial budget increases in recent years may be in 
for a period of flat budget growth 
the lowering of the military threat only advances other 
responsibilities of ours webster said particularly in the areas 
of armscontrol verification the agency now is watching 
implementation of the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty at 
120 sites inside the soviet union if a strategic arms treaty is 
concluded monitoring will involve 2500 sites he noted 
the agency is in the middle of an expensive fiveyear bolstering 
of its satellite spying capability 
on other topics webster said 
the salvadoran fmln rebels continue to make a symbolic and 
important statement about their ability to keep causing trouble 
through urban attacks but pose no threat to the rightist 
government of alfredo cristiani it is clear the rebels are 
receiving soviet bloc weaponry and we have a right to assume a 
soviet involvement 
it is time for the debate over a longstanding us ban on 
participation in assassinations of foreign leaders revived after a 
failed coup in panama to fade from public attention ambiguities 
about the policy with congressional overseers have been eliminated 
and it is now clear that the risk of violence in a coup is not to 
be equated with participation in assassination 
he will not predict whether president bush will sign a bill 
authorizing intelligence activities for the coming year that would 
create for the first time an independent inspector general at the 
cia the inspector general would answer to congress as well as the 
agency director which will have adverse effects on our liaisons 
with other intelligence agencies because they will be less 
inclined to trust what they say will be kept secret he said if 
it becomes law we will do our best to make it work

the supreme court was asked wednesday to rule 
that most young girls have no right to abortions without first 
telling their parents 
the justices who have allowed limits on the availability of 
abortions for minors in the past questioned lawyers defending and 
attacking parentalnotification laws in minnesota and ohio 
in two hours of relatively narrow arguments they gave no sign 
they are considering the broader possibility of scrapping the 
courts 1973 roe vs wade decision that legalized abortion an 
idea much discussed outside the court whenever they take up any 
abortion case 
the court showed no interest in overturning a womans 
constitutional right to abortion cleveland lawyer linda sogg 
said after the argument session in which she attacked the ohio law 
minnesota chief deputy attorney general john tunheim agreed i 
dont think roe should be on the table in this case he told 
reporters after defending his state law before the court 
last july the court voted 54 to give states more authority to 
regulate abortions for all women four justices appeared ready to 
go even further and overturn roe vs wade but justice sandra day 
oconnor refused 
groups on both sides of the abortion issue had looked to the 
court this term to help clarify its allegiance to the 1973 decision 
but settlement of an illinois dispute over regulating abortion 
clinics a case that was to be argued before the justices next 
month may have eliminated the greatest immediate threat to roe 
vs wade the illinois settlement still must be approved by a 
federal judge 
oconnor is expected to play the pivotal role again in the 
minnesota and ohio cases to be decided by july at issue in both 
are laws requiring parents to be notified before abortions are 
performed on unmarried girls under 18 who are still supported by 
parents 
about half the states have laws requiring parental notification 
or even parental consent in such cases but most of the laws 
have been invalidated after court challenges 
nationwide about 40 percent of the nearly 1 million teenagers 
who become pregnant each year seek abortions of the 15 million 
legal abortions performed annually since 1973 about 12 percent 
180000 a year have been for girls 17 and younger 
the ohio law requires that one of a minors parents be notified 
by a doctor at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed the 
girl can avoid telling her parent if she persuades a judge she is 
mature enough to make the decision on her own or that telling her 
parents is not in her best interest 
the minnesota law requires that the minors two biological 
parents be notified at least 48 hours before she has an abortion a 
judicial bypass alternative also is provided 
both tunheim minnesotas lawyer and ohio assistant attorney 
general rita eppler argued that states do not have to provide a 
judicial alternative in such cases but because both states do 
provide them the court might not have to say 
oconnor vigorously questioning tunheim seemed deeply troubled 
by minnesotas twoparent requirement 
the statute just doesnt provide for any exceptions even when 
its not in the childs best interest oconnor said how do 
you defend the states interest in requiring both parents be 
notified she asked tunheim 
oconnor also quizzed ms eppler about that portion of the ohio 
law requiring a girl to prove her maturity by clear and 
convincing evidence oconnor asked whether the standard might be 
too stringent resulting in a greater risk of erroneous 
deprivation of a minors abortion right 
oconnor never has said whether she believes such a right to 
abortion for any woman exists 
the court in 1981 allowed states to require parental 
notification before minors abortions but the focus in that utah 
case was limited to how the state law was applied to immature 
minors 
ms eppler said the ohio law represents no undue burden and 
properly balances a minors rights with the need for parental 
involvement when their daughter faces perhaps the most serious 
dilemma of her young life 
but ms sogg warned the court that not all parents are 
loving she said many girls seeking abortions need to be 
protected from parental retaliation and abuse 
the minnesota law was in effect for five years before being 
ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge a federal appeals court 
later ruled that the law is valid but blocked its enforcement 
pending supreme court action 
the ohio law enacted in 1985 never took effect due to a 
successful legal challenge by an akron abortion clinic and one of 
its doctors

the kremlins latest bid to break a bitter 
territorial dispute between armenia and azerbaijan was met 
wednesday with demonstrations strikes and angry criticism from 
both sides 
on the final day of its fall session tuesday the supreme soviet 
parliament overwhelmingly approved a directive disbanding a special 
commission that had imposed direct rule from moscow on the disputed 
nagornokarabakh territory the territory is located inside 
azerbaijan but the the majority of its population is armenian 
the decision appeared to give ultimate control over 
nagornokarabakh back to azerbaijan it ordered azerbaijan 
officials to work with reinstated local officials from 
nagornokarabakh to ensure law and order economic and cultural 
development in the region 
it established a parliamentary oversight commission and said 
that soldiers would remain in the region to ensure stability during 
the transition 
officials of that commission have acknowledged that despite the 
presence of interior ministry soldiers a virtual civil war has 
raged there 
the regions armenian population supported by the neighboring 
armenian republic has demanding that it be annexed to armenia 
because of what it calls years of willful neglect by azerbaijani 
authorities 
the whole resolution doesnt suit us said ektibar mamedov 
a spokesman for the azerbaijani peoples front movement 
bobkin arargetsyan an armenian activist said the decision by 
the supreme soviet parliament proved legislators cant make a 
political decision based on the internationally recognized right of 
selfdetermination 
oleg bakhshyan a spokesman for the disbanded commission in 
stepanakert nagornokarabakhs main city said by telephone that 
few people were happy with the decision 
activists from both sides said a general strike was under way in 
nagornokarabakh 
thousands of people gathered in the armenian capital yerevan on 
tuesday to protest the decision said arargetsyan a member of 
armenias karabakh committee a joint meeting of the armenian 
supreme soviet legislature and nagornokarabakh legislators was 
scheduled thursday he said 
in a continuation of the violence that has killed scores of 
people since february 1988 arargetsyan said a policeman was killed 
in a border region between the two republics on wednesday he had 
few details and the report could not be confirmed independently 
deputies from nagornokarabakh and armenia walked out of the 
supreme soviet session on tuesday to protest the resolution and 
arargetsyan said armenian communist party official golust goloyan 
appeared on local television wednesday night to criticize the 
supreme soviets move 
but mamedov the azerbaijani activist claimed that there was a 
secret point to the agreement that prevents azerbaijan from 
interfering in the affairs of nagornokarabakh 
he predicted more violence in the mountainous region

president fw de klerk said 
wednesday the government is considering changing the 3yearold 
emergency restrictions on the press in a way that will address the 
difficulties of journalists and editors as well as security 
concerns 
in a speech to the johannesburg press club de klerk said the 
government doesnt want to place any unneccessary obstacles in the 
way of the press because he said it has an important task to 
perform in the debate on changing south africa 
he said the whole question of the national emergency was under 
constant review and it would be lifted as soon as circumstances 
permit 
de klerk had been expected to make a more substantive statement 
on the emergency media regulations which prohibit journalists from 
covering or reporting on unrest events or security force action 
boycotts strikes statements the government considers subversive 
and detentions without trial the restrictions are not uniformly 
obeyed and scores of journalists have been repeatedly arrested at 
the scene of news events 
several newspapers have been closed without recourse to the 
courts and one the new nation is under threat of a second 
closure 
one newspaper editor faces a prison sentence for violating the 
emergency regulations by quoting a prohibited person 
on friday the governmentrun south african broadcasting corp 
had given the strongest indication yet that some of the emergency 
restrictions were about to be lifted 
the lifting of media restrictions that are no longer relevant 
in todays relaxed political climate will promote a more open 
public debate on crucial national issues and bring the country 
closer to more comprehensive and fruitful negotiations on a new 
political and constitutional dispensation it said in a 
commentary 
former president pw botha declared the national emergency on 
june 12 1986 and renewed the emergency restrictions in 1977 
1988 and 1989 saying they were necessary to control a situation 
of political unrest in black townships botha was ousted in august 
and de klerk became acting president before leading the national 
party government to a parliamentary victory in september 
de klerk already has modified the emergency regulations by 
allowing outdoor political rallies and marches which had 
previously routinely been broken up by police the prohibition 
remains on the books and can be invoked at any time along with 
bans on many forms of political expression including wearing 
tshirts displaying of banners and making certain speeches the 
punishment for violation of an emergency regulation is a maximum of 
six months in prison or a 4500 fine

a house committee on wednesday called for 
stronger action against doctors and hospitals that provide 
substandard care for medicare patients 
the house government operations committee said that while 
tougher laws are needed the department of health and human services 
also must begin to use the broader authority congress granted in 
1985 to punish doctors and hospitals 
a report by the panel criticized the department for the delay in 
putting out regulations to enforce the law which allows hhs to 
deny payment hospitals and physicians in cases where substandard 
care is provided 
the department is working on the regulations said dennis 
siebert a spokesman for the health care financing administration 
which handles medicare the government healthcare program for 33 
million elderly blind and disabled americans 
theyre fairly controversial and complex regulations he 
said weve spent a lot of time consulting with medical care 
industry 
currently physicians can be terminated from participating in 
medicare or be fined up to the amount of the care provided but 
only in cases where there has been a clear pattern of incompentence 
by physicians who were unwilling or unable to improve their 
treatment 
the report said the standard that has to met is too stringent 
because it allows physicians to escape punishment by agreeing to 
taken an educational course to indicate their willingness to 
improve it also said the monetary penalty is too low 
hhs inspector general richard kusserow recommended that congress 
strengthen the standard and raise the fine to 10000 per case 
the report also estimated that more than 800000 errors are made 
each year by doctors and hospitals caring for medicare patients 
mostly by releasing them too early 
the large number of beneficiaries who may be at risk of 
inadequate hospitaldischarge planning is of special concern to the 
committee due to fears that the pps system medicares system for 
paying hospitals is resulting in patients being discharged 
faster and less stable the report said 
eight republicans on the 39member committee in an accompanying 
document cautioned that the error estimate was derived by 
extrapolating from random reviews called generic screens which 
were designed to detect potential problems an error can result 
from merely failing to sign a form in the proper place they said 
if an exhaustive look were taken at all generic screen 
failures we are convinced the number of quality problems would be 
far below the committee reports projections they said 
the report said the prospective payment system created in 1983 
as a medicare costsaving measure provides the greatest profits 
to hospitals that give the shortest inhospital care and the least 
services 
under the system hospitals are paid a flat fee for each 
treatment they provide the fee assumes a certain length of 
hospital stay and medical services

attempts by congress to keep farmers from 
dodging a 50000 limit on federal crop subsidies probably will 
have little effect because farmers are creating new loopholes the 
agriculture departments watchdog agency said wednesday 
the departments office of inspector general said in a new audit 
report that 1987 legislative changes are scheduled to take effect 
this year and in 1990 for wheat feed grains rice cotton honey 
and other pricesupported commodities 
but the 1987 legislation failed to effectively limit the use of 
multiple legal entities and other ways to avoid the payment 
limitations the report said 
federal crop deficiency payments used to make up part of the 
difference between a low market price and some higher price target 
are supposed to be limited to 50000 per person as an example 
last months average corn price at the farm was 220 per bushel 
the target price for 1989 corn is 284 farmers should get 64 
cents per bushel from the government 
however our review determined that producers have found new 
innovative ways to reorganize farming operations so that 1989 
payments will not be limited significantly by the legislative 
changes the report said 
the audit report which was provided upon request by the 
associated press followed one sent to congress describing the 
inspector generals activities for the sixmonth period that ended 
on sept 30 
in that review the excessive crop subsidies were noted among a 
number of abuses checked by investigators and auditors the audit 
report released on wednesday dealt specifically with operations of 
crop programs handled by the departments agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service 
the auditors checked five state offices of the agency and 14 
county offices in the counties 822 of 7424 farm operating plans 
were selected for preliminary review finally 52 farms were chosen 
for indepth analysis 
the review of 52 farming operations identified 12 that 
reorganized so that all entities which can be individuals 
corporations associations trusts or other legal entities could 
continue receiving payments as persons under the program 
for example one operation we reviewed in tunica miss 
created 51 irrevocable trusts in 1989 so as not to have payments 
reduced the report said the operation involved three joint 
ventures a b and c controlled by two intermingled families and 
was determined to include 43 persons in 1988 
the 43 persons consisted of six individuals and 37 
corporations the report said owners of the 37 corporations 
consisted of 11 individuals and one corporation 
seven of the individual owners were the immediate members of 
the two families a father and two daughters and a father two 
sons and a daughter that controlled the operation the report 
said 
if the complex arrangement had remained as it was in 1988 it 
would have collected no more than 700000 in payments in 1989 but 
with reorganization the operation is expected to collect as much 
as 1431576 in subsidies this year 
one of the family members of this organization told us that 
the main purpose of the reorganization was to maintain the maximum 
program benefits the report said he said it became a 
challenge to see if he could get a trust established for all of the 
operations fulltime employees he called it a profitsharing 
plan 
although the reorganization was allowed by current regulations 
auditors said the trusts themselves are believed to be 
flowthrough entities to avoid new regulations last year 
limiting a persons membership in more than three entities 
we conclude this because about 13 billion per year will be 
routed back to the seven immediate family members through 
management fees equipment and land leases and loans the report 
said 
no individual names were released here are the counties or 
parishes checked

a possible agreement next year between nato 
and the warsaw pact nations to cut conventional arms and troops 
will have a minimal direct effect on us military spending 
defense analysts said wednesday 
but a reduction in the warsaw pacts superiority in armed 
forces tanks artillery and armored troop carriers could have an 
indirect impact that would result in longterm savings for the 
united states 
in negotiations between the nato and the warsaw pact president 
bush has proposed that the united states and the soviet union 
reduce their forces in europe to 275000 on each side the soviets 
would have to withdraw 300000 troops while the united states 
reduce its forces by 30000 
the american cut of 30000 amounts to less than 15 percent of 
the 21 million us troops worldwide and the congressional budget 
office has estimated savings from that reduction of about 21 
billion annually 
the current pentagon budget is about 300 billion 
analysts for the defense budget project an independent 
nonprofit research group told a news conference that conventional 
arms reductions would have to produce larger savings to have a 
significant impact on us military spending 
longterm savings could occur if after an agreement is reached 
creating a numerical parity between the 16 nato countries and the 
seven warsaw pact nations nato decides it needs less war stocks 
can rely more on reserve forces and less expensive lighter 
infantry forces and limits modernization of its military hardware 
at the news conference on the issue of us policy after a 
conventional arms agreement stephen flanagan a member of the 
state departments policy planning staff said such a treaty will 
be a watershed event but a number of outstanding issues means 
the pact is not a done deal 
political developments in eastern europe make it difficult to 
predict what the soviet force structure will be and what levels the 
united states will maintain in europe flanagan said

yugoslavias largest republic 
serbia urged all its organizations to sever ties with rival 
slovenia on wednesday in what analysts said may be the first step 
toward the breakup of communist yugoslavia 
the move came after the northern republic of slovenia introduced 
emergency measures to prevent a mass rally planned for friday by 
serb nationalists seeking to topple slovenias liberal leadership 
organizers had predicted at least 40000 people from serbia 
would travel to the rally in ljubljana the slovenian capital 
the serbian socialist alliance issued a proclamation calling on 
all serbian institutions and enterprises to break all contacts 
with slovenia 
the alliance a communistled mass organization serves as a 
mouthpiece for the republics ambitious president slobodan 
milosevic 
it said serbs will no longer allow themselves to be 
humiliated by slovenia and that all freedoms and human rights 
have been suspended there 
the state tanjug news agency carried a statement from the 
rallys organizing committee calling off the rally because we 
dont want to be greeted by clubs and rifles 
slovenian tv called serbias decision senseless and said the 
serbian leadership has reached the lowest possible moral and 
political level 
western diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity consider 
serbias move as a first step toward disintegration of yugoslavia 
the country is a loose confederation of six republics and two 
provinces containing many different nationalities and religious 
groups economic problems and sinking living standards have 
heightened ethnic tensions 
a commentary broadcast nationwide on an evening newscast said 
serbias decision complicated the political situation in the 
country to an extreme 
slovenian police said earlier wednesday they would block all 
vehicles carrying serbian demonstrators to the rally in ljubljana 
they announced other emergency measures including banning all 
public rallies and gatherings of more than 30 people without 
explicit approval by authorities 
slovenian authorities hinted they would use force against 
demonstrators who planned to travel the 550 miles to ljubljana by 
bus train and automobile the rally was to protest alleged 
harassment of the serbian minority in kosovo province by ethnic 
albanians 
the protesters reportedly demanded toppling of the liberal 
slovenian leadership that they claimed supports the ethnic 
albanians they accused the albanians of intimidating the serb 
minority and forcing serbs to leave the economically backward 
province 
hardliners in the serbian leadership supported the ljubljana 
protest they strongly oppose the westernstyle democratization 
processes in slovenia including next years planned introduction 
of a multiparty system 
serbia advocates the communist partys continued monopoly on 
power and strong central control it is deadlocked with slovenia 
over yugoslavias political future serbian leaders have been 
accusing slovenia of wanting to secede from the federation and the 
statement by the socialist alliance said serbs will no longer beg 
slovenes not to break away from yugoslavia 
yugoslavias population of nearly 24 million includes 9 million 
serbs and 2 million slovenes slovenia is economically the most 
developed region

longer than anyone else in the states history he was convicted of

as much as 150 billion or more in 
taxpayers money is likely to be wasted by the federal government 
in the near future because of antiquated accounting systems 
lackadaisical management and hollow commitments to doing better 
congress was told wednesday 
its investigative agency the general accounting office said 
problems exist in every major federal department and agency the 
gao said the shoddy government oversight of how its money is spent 
is years old in some cases and blamed reagan administration 
deregulation and staff cutbacks for much of the problem 
the gao also said that an ongoing audit of the air force had 
found its financial statements dead wrong in practically 
every area and cautioned that conditions likely were worse in the 
army and navy because the air force is believed to have superior 
records 
there is a seemingly neverending and costly trail of 
mismanagement abuse and illegal acts involving federal programs 
the gao said in the report to the senate government affairs 
committee most of the problems are known and in many instances 
have been known for years but they remain uncorrected 
comptroller general charles bowsher who heads the gao said the 
government has wasted hundreds of millions of millions of dollars 
on systems designed to improve accounting that proved virtually 
useless 
whats more he said many identified problems remain 
uncorrected because government managers charged in a 1982 law with 
identifying flaws treat them just as a paperwork exercise 
he said the government needed to make a major investment in 
stateoftheart accounting and financialmanagement systems but 
said he did not know how much that would cost 
he recommended the appointment of a governmentwide chief 
financial officer to oversee government spending with deputies 
at each major agency who would be required to file detailed monthly 
and annual financial reports 
the chairman of the committee sen john glenn dohio said he 
would press for passage of legislation creating those posts when 
congress returns next year this government being one of the 
biggest businesses in the world weve just got to do it glenn 
said 
bowsher said the multibillion dollar scandals involving the 
savings and loan industry the department of housing and urban 
development and the energy departments troubled nuclear plants 
were likely to be followed by billions more in fraud waste and 
abuse for a common reason lousy management 
we have every major agency in the federal government 
acknowledging that they have weak financial management sytstems 
bowsher said adding that the government was bound to end up with 
scandals and fraud and mismanagement 
bowsher said the office of managment and budget a white house 
agency recently had improved its efforts to identify problems 
areas he said the gao too was launching a governmentwide review 
to identify the potential for costly waste and abuse 
he said the defense department the internal revenue service 
nasa the medicare system the pension benefit guaranty corp the 
government insurer of private pension systems and student loan 
programs already had been placed on gaos priority watch list 
likely to be added he said were a host of government 
insurance credit and financing programs including the export 
import bank the farmers home administration foreign military 
sales accounts and the new agency set up to bail out failing sampls 
he said 150 billion was not unrealistic as an estimate of 
waste and fraud likely to occur in the near future a figure that 
did not include the twoyear air force audit which bowsher said 
had not reached the point at which he could put a price tag on the 
problem 
that report is due in january and the gao plans a followup 
audit before moving on to the army and navy bowsher said 
bowsher said reaganera deregulation and staff reductions were 
made at a time the government had no plan to achieve the cutbacks 
and not lessen our oversight and control we have been penny 
wise and really pound foolish 
complicating poor oversight and accounting has been the rapid 
turnover among senior agency political appointees and the 
reluctance of cabinet members to tackle complicated management 
problems he said 
the great turnover of the presidential appointees is a great 
problem for our government he said 
congress also has contributed to the problem by placing certain 
programs including the savings and loan bailout off budget 
to keep their costs from affecting the federal deficit 
we see a trend here of going off budget but not for a moment 
reducing the risk to the american taxpayer he said the hollow 
government is really happening and im afraid its going to get 
more hollow because of the budget deficit 
bowsher delivered to the senate a gao report on compliance with 
the 1982 financial integrity act which required agency managers to 
report annually on potential weaknesses in government management 
half of those managers have not been trained to prepare the 
required reports the gao found

hud secretary jack kemp has given up his new 
york state residency ending any chance hell run for governor next 
year a spokesman said 
kemp notified the erie board of elections on monday that he was 
withdrawing his voting registration there said robert nipp a 
housing and urban development spokesman in washington 
he intends to register in montgomery county maryland said 
nipp 
nipp said kemp was making the change because hes no longer a 
congressman from buffalo and he has his home in bethesda 
steven lafever a spokesman for the new york state republican 
committee and a former official at the state board of elections 
said that to run for governor a person must be a resident of the 
state for five consecutive years 
state gop chairman j patrick barrett had hoped that kemp who 
unsuccessfully sought the 1988 republican presidential nomination 
might be willing to challenge democrat mario cuomos expected 
reelection bid next year 
a recent gop poll had found that among those new yorkers 
surveyed kemp tested well against the popular cuomo the governor 
won that theoretical matchup 48 percent to 42 percent 
cuomo should he do well in a reelection bid next year or skip 
it entirely is considered a potential 1992 presidential contender 
because of that supporters of president bush would like to see 
cuomo given a tough race next year

president fw de klerk 
declared wednesday that no one can kill with impunity and said he 
will reveal next week what the government plans to do about alleged 
murders by police death squads 
in a speech to the johannesburg press club de klerk said his 
cabinet had received an official report and was giving it urgent 
attention he said criminal action in government service would not 
be tolerated 
the report completed tuesday by a provincial attorney general 
and a police commander covers a fiveweek investigation of claims 
by three former policemen that they were in death squads that 
killed opponents of the government 
de klerk did not say whether he had seen the report which was 
presented wednesday to justice minister kobie coetsee and adriaan 
vlok the law and order minister 
we believe that nobody has the right to take the law in his 
own hands de klerk said the misuse of rights to exercise 
violence against the life and property of people must be opposed 
and punished wherever it occurred 
new allegations about death squad activity were made in the 
netherlands on tuesday by a 27yearold south african who 
identified himself as mervyn malan and said he was a cousin of 
south africas defense minister gen magnus malan 
on wednesday the general said he had no knowledge of a relative 
named mervyn the defense ministry said it was not ready to comment 
on the mans allegations that his former army unit had carried out 
attacks on civilians 
the state south african broadcasting corp which reflects 
government thinking said the very idea of a police assassination 
squad operating in south africa is so monstrous as to be almost 
unbelievable 
it is absolutely essential that the facts are established 
in a manner that leaves no room for doubt that justice had been 
done it said in an editorial 
unless justice is not only done but seen to be done those 
allegations will be believed and exploited for propaganda in 
quarters hostile to south africa 
in a speech at a police parade tuesday de klerk said strong 
action would be taken against any officers implicated in death 
squad activity he added that most policemen behaved in an 
impeccable manner and did not deserve to be dragged through the 
mud 
he also announced steps to reduce military and police influence 
on national security policy they include abolishing the national 
security management system set up by former president pw botha 
to coordinate a strategy that included suppression of activists and 
improvement of black communities 
several newspapers suggested wednesday abolishing the security 
system was a prelude to partial or total lifting of the state of 
emergency botha declared on june 12 1986 
the system is dominated by officers of the security forces and 
reports to the state security council of generals police 
commanders and certain cabinet ministers 
critics said it usurped the powers of parliament and municipal 
governments and set policy on the international national and local 
level

a former nazi ss sergeant 
suspected of the 1944 death camp execution of german communist 
leader ernst thaelmann has died wolfgang otto who served as a 
guard at the buchenwald concentration camp died sunday at his home 
in the town of geldern the rheinische post newspaper reported 
wednesday he was 78 
otto was said to be in frail health he had lived in geldern 
near west germanys border with the netherlands for more than 10 
years 
in may 1986 otto was found guilty of complicity in the shooting 
death of thaelmann at buchenwald thaelmann was imprisoned when the 
nazis took power in 1933 
otto was sentenced to four years in prison by a court in krefeld 
but remained free pending an appeal 
prosecutors had argued nazi leader adolf hitler personally 
ordered thaelmanns execution and that otto carried out the orders 
otto denied the charges 
the case was appealed to west germanys supreme court which 
overturned the verdict because of a legal error 
two years later otto was retried and acquitted of the murder 
charges by a duesseldorf state court the court said there was 
insufficient evidence 
otto served five years of a separate 20year war crimes sentence 
imposed by a us military court in 1947 his later prosecution was 
delayed by bureaucratic wrangling complicated by the failing 
memories and deaths of witnesses

country for the sake of freedom the mti news agency said 
her whereabouts were not known the agency initially reported 
she had applied for political asylum but later said she had been 
granted a temporary residence permit valid for three days

world with the firstever perfect scores in gymnastics winning 
three olympic gold medals on the uneven bars balance beam and 
overall competition at the montreal games 
during a career that lasted until 1984 comaneci won 21 gold 
medals in olympic and other international competition after ending 
her competitive career she turned coach and referee and served as 
a role model for romanian youth 
because of her achievements comaneci was made a hero of 
socialist labor by president nicolae ceausescu the hardline 
communist leader who has refused to bend to the wave of reform 
sweeping the east bloc 
at one time she was linked romantically with nicu ceausescu 
the presidents son 
she reportedly lived a comparatively plush life in a country 
notorious for its chronic shortages of consumer goods as well as 
for the ceausescu brand of neostalinism about 25000 romanians 
have fled to hungary the past two years 
despite the adulation of her countrymen and the rewards of her 
government comaneci often expressed dissatisfaction with the 
demands of her career she repeatedly complained of exhaustion 
overtraining and physical disorders as a result of her rigorous 
training and competition schedule 
mti said comaneci complained to hungarian border officials that 
her government had refused to let her work or even travel abroad 
she received the temporary residence permit in szeged a town about 
15 miles from the romanian border

tuesday into hungary by car at the nearby border town of kiszombor 
with six other romanians who were not identified 
citing unconfirmed reports mti said comaneci and her companions

an american tour with the romanian gymnastics team 
im ready to help her in any manner if she needs it said 
karolyi who became a us citizen last spring 
her defection is what i was really wishing would happen one of 
these days he said in an interview from clarens switzerland 
where he was coaching the us womens team at an international 
meet 
comaneci is still a big personality in romania she has 
nothing against the romanian population but just like me she was 
chased out of the country by the romanian authorities karolyi 
said 
the coach said he would recommend that comaneci go to the united 
states because of the opportunities there 
officials in washington said there was no immediate indication 
she would try to gain admission to the united states 
i am not aware of anything right now said verne jervis 
spokesman for the us immigration and naturalization service 
comaneci has said in the past that she was offered coaching jobs 
in the west but she did not say where 
patty auer a spokesperson for the us gymnastics federation in 
indianapolis said we have no official word on any offers but 
that wouldnt surprise me there have been no overtures from the

us rep donald lukens convicted of 
having sex with a 16yearold girl has left for taiwan while a 
state court hears arguments in his appeal but is upbeat about 
his prospects an aide said wednesday 
the 58yearold republican from middletown was convicted may 26 
of contributing to the unruliness of a minor and was sentenced to 
30 days in jail and a 500 fine he is appealing to the 10th ohio 
district court of appeals while free on bond 
oral arguments were scheduled for thursday morning 
lukens left wednesday for taiwan with four other congressmen to 
oversee elections there on friday said william jarrell lukens 
chief of staff 
jarrell said lukens refused a request for an interview on the 
advice of his attorney 
i can tell you that hes very upbeat about it but he will be 
nowhere near columbus ohio tomorrow jarrell said in a 
telephone interview from his washington office 
lukens was convicted after a fiveday trial in franklin county 
domestic relations court the girl rosie coffman and her mother 
anna had charged that lukens knew she was underage when he paid 
her to have sex at his columbus apartment in november 1988 the 
girl is now 17 
lukens who did not testify at the trial had denied the 
allegations 
anna coffmans complaint to a columbus television station last 
year led to the congressmans indictment in february 
she testified at the trial that during a meeting with lukens in 
november 1988 lukens offered to find her a government job after 
she accused him of having sex with her daughter television station 
wsyx videotaped the meeting 
court records show that the focus of the appeal will be a ruling 
by domestic relations judge ronald solove that kept lukens 
attorney thomas tyack from using rosie coffmans juvenile court 
file and school records as evidence tyack had said the records 
were crucial to the defense 
tyack did not return telephone messages seeking comment 
wednesday 
thomas tornabene a spokesman for franklin county prosecutor 
michael millers office said the state will argue that the girls 
past had nothing to do with the encounter in lukens apartment 
lukens conviction sparked calls for his resignation from 
republican leaders in ohio including in his home district in 
congress the house ethics committee is investigating lukens 
lukens has said he will await the outcome of his appeal before 
deciding whether to seek reelection

a state supreme court justice who is 
suing trans world airlines over a delay in getting his luggage has 
filed more papers in the case this time likening himself to don 
quixote as he seeks 38000 in damages 
justice richard neely filed a lawsuit in july seeking the 
damages from the airline as well as a 3000 speaking fee for 
telling passengers what he thought was the delay in receiving their 
luggage 
the july incident was vexatious neely said in papers filed 
tuesday in kanawha county circuit court to try to force the airline 
to supply information 
after standing around in a confined space at about 88 degrees 
fahrenheit at kennedy airport for over half an hour plaintiff and 
about 150 other passengers concluded that their baggage was in 
imminent peril of taking an unscheduled trip to their planes next 
stop frankfurt germany neely said in the documents 
neely who had flown from seattle to new york said he was told 
by a twa employee that the planes cargo door was jammed and he 
stood on a luggage conveyor belt to relay that information to other 
passengers 
plaintiff was mistaken for a twa employee and subjected to 
obloquy ridicule contempt and abuse don quixote doing a good 
deed for the galley slaves the justice said 
robert king an attorney for twa said wednesday the airline 
denies that neelys luggage was delayed and said his suit is 
intended to harass the airline 
we have previously said we believe the lawsuit to be 
frivolous and we intend to defend it vigorously and we intend to 
be successful in that defense king said 
the documents filed were neelys second attempt to get the court 
to force twa to provide all statements issued or published by twa 
chairman carl icahn about employee compensation through july 1989 
neely claims that twa under icahn instituted policies it knew 
would lower employee morale create an atmosphere of passive 
resistance amoung defendants lower echelon employees and 
inevitably result in the abusive treatment of passengers 
at trial plaintiff will try to prove that mr icahns 
leveraged buyout of twa has diverted money from passenger amenities 
particularly sufficienty personnel competently to handle lost and 
delayed baggage claims to junk bond speculators 
king called neelys request for documents way beyond the 
bounds of proper discovery 
a circuit court hearing is scheduled for dec 14

attorney general dick thornburgh said 
wednesday that news leaks prompted him to order a complete review 
of justice department press guidelines to tighten the release of 
information 
i expect it to result in two things one that we will have 
some success in reducing the number of leaks of pending criminal 
investigations and secondly that we speak with one voice on 
policy matters thornburgh said 
the review of the entire spectrum of public information 
policies was occasioned by a series of news leaks about criminal 
investigations including an fbi probe of felix bloch the us 
diplomat suspected of espionage the attorney general said 
thornburgh has attributed the fbis inability so far to solve 
the case on news accounts that disclosed the investigation last 
summer 
it was lets leak like a sieve when i got here the 
attorney general said in an oftenstormy session with reporters 
peoples rights were being compromised our investigations were 
being compromised by unauthorized disclosures of information 
regarding criminal investigations thornburgh said 
thornburgh launched a number of investigations of leaks notably 
to try to identify the source of information about an fbi 
investigation into financial practices in the office of rep 
william gray iii dpa 
the leak occurred while gray was seeking election in the house 
as majority whip prompting accusations from democratic lawmakers 
that thornburghs aides were the source of a political leak 
the political firestorm also forced the justice department to 
state several days later that gray was not a target of the 
investigation and was cooperating with the probe 
asked if he was satisfied that leak did not come from his 
office thornburgh said i havent had an oportunity to review 
the results of the investigation 
thornburgh disclosed the departmentwide review which began 
earlier this fall when questioned about proposed bureau of prisons 
regulations that would restrict reporters interviews of federal 
inmates 
later in the day thornburgh issued a statement saying he had 
ordered the bureau of prisons to withdraw the proposed regulations 
saying this proposal was submitted prematurely and without my 
personal review it will be subject to further review before 
resubmission 
the regulations published this week would allow prison wardens 
to bar reporters who do not verify any allegations about 
prisons or inmates with corrections officials 
during his session with reporters thornburgh said the proposed 
regulations are intended to guarantee an accurate flow of 
information and observe what is necessary to properly manage 
prison facilities 
the attorney general did not cite specific examples of 
inaccurate news stories referring all questions to the bureau of 
prisons where a spokesman did not immediately return a reporters 
telephone call

ins spokesman verne jervis said district and regional officials 
will have discretion to answer reporters questions about arrests 
of illegal aliens or breaking news 
its not a gagging its not a silencing jervis said its 
a means i will use the word of controlling of knowing what is 
being said in the field before you read it in the newspaper or see 
it on television jervis said 
thornburghs session with reporters was punctuated by complaints 
that the attorney general had made it difficult for reporters to 
get even the most basic information about department operations 
our subject is ordinary information not sensitive 
information not criminal information said one reporter 
we try to give it as best we can thornburgh said 
but were not getting it the reporter replied 
the attorney general acknowledged that my reputation with you 
folks has deteriorated because you dont like the fact that i dont 
condone leaks or encourage leaks 
were not talking about leaks the reporter repeated 
i am thornburgh replied i am talking about what has 
impelled me to try to tighten up the process of discussion of 
matters in the department

soviet officials rejected west german chancellor 
helmut kohls german reunificiation plan wednesday the first day 
of mikhail s gorbachevs visit to italy they said a united 
germany could upset european stability 
as the soviet president was hailed in the streets of rome by 
throngs shouting bravo mikhail bravo a soviet spokesman 
dismissed the 10point plan for phased reunification of the two 
germanys outlined tuesday by kohl 
the rejection showed mounting soviet concern that the kremlins 
tolerance of democratic reforms in the east bloc could be used to 
disrupt gorbachevs vision of a common european home erasing 
the lines between east and west 
while gorbachev met privately for more than 1 hours with 
premier giulio andreotti foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
expressed moscows concerns to foreign minister gianni de michelis 
and other italian officials a spokesman said 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov told a 
news briefing not one country in europe is anxious to see a 
united germany because it could upset the present stability in 
europe 
gerasimov said shevardnadze told the italians the soviet union 
would not reconsider its opposition to the kohl plan unless west 
germany first renounces any claim to the preworld war ii borders 
of germany which included many areas now belonging to poland the 
soviet union and other border states 
a west german constitutional court ruled in 1972 that in the 
absence of a treaty defining new borders the legal boundaries of 
germany are those that existed in 1937 before adolf hitler 
launched the war that led to his death and the carving up of the 
german nation 
in moscow gerasimov deputy yuri gremitskikh rejected the kohl 
plan in even harsher language calling it an attempt to shift the 
movement that started in east germany to nationalistic lines 
gremitskikh said kohl presented the plan without considering the 
opinions of other countries 
on the first day of his threeday state visit gorbachev waded 
into cheering crowds who shouted gorby gorby as he and his 
wife took a whirlwind tour of rome between official talks that 
focused on the tumultuous changes taking place in eastern europe 
on friday he will have a historic meeting with pope john paul 
ii at the vatican 
the first soviet communist party chief to visit italy gorbachev 
was greeted like a conquering hero by flagwaving romans who 
rarely display any particular enthusiasm for visiting foreign 
dignataries 
during a 10minute stop at the colosseum gorbachev and his 
wife raisa started into a crowd and were instantly engulfed by 
shouting wellwishers 
some young people began singing the internationale the 
socialist anthem and others waved the red and yellow flag of the 
big italian communist party now in the midst of a soulsearching 
comparable to that going on among communists in much of eastern 
europe 
surrounded by kgb bodyguards and italian security agents the 
gorbachevs emerged beaming after shaking dozens of hands 
gorbachev met andreotti in a teteatete that stretched from the 
halfhour scheduled to more than three times that leaving official 
delegations to carry on without them 
in remarks prepared for a state dinner in his honor at the 
presidential palace gorbachev expressed gratitude for italys 
willingness to help the soviet union recover economically but said 
that in the end only the soviets can implement perestroika 
restructuring of the economy and politics 
it is not rare that in the west we are asked how we can be 
helped he said the biggest help consists in understanding our 
processes and problems we are open to cooperation we are 
favorable to its new forms but perestroika has to be realized by 
ourselves 
all the riches of the west cannot substitute what we have to 
do ourselves we have enormous natural riches a powerful 
production system an inestimable intellectual potential it is 
through perestroika that we have to put all of this to its best 
use 
president francesco cossiga toasted gorbachev with warm praise 
for his efforts to move from confrontation to cooperation between 
east and west and said italy intends to play a part in forming a 
united europe 
he wished gorbachev well in his shipboard summit off malta this 
weekend with president bush

tests on a sample of air duct contaminated 
with plutonium dust at the rocky flats nuclear weapons plant have 
revealed only a fraction of the plutonium inspectors had feared was 
present officials said 
laboratory tests found only 1 percent as much of the highly 
radioactive element as inspectors estimated in august a department 
of energy official at the plant said tuesday 
rocky flats is the only government plant at which plutonium 
triggers for nuclear weapons are made the plant 16 miles 
northwest of denver is operated by rockwell corp for doe 
in august doe inspectors said they found 11 pounds of plutonium 
in air ducts at the plant one of the most serious recent 
allegations about dangerous practices at the plant 
rocky flats safety and hazardous waste disposal practices have 
come under intense scrutiny in recent months fbi agents and 
environmental protection agency inspectors raided the plant on june 
6 looking for evidence of illegal waste disposal and a special 
federal grand jury convened aug 1 to examine the allegations 
the inspectors said enough plutonium dust could be clumped 
together in the air ducts to cause an uncontrolled nuclear chain 
reaction although no evidence has been found that such a reaction 
occurred 
inspectors had said they found one section of duct that 
contained 1600 grams or 56 ounces of plutonium per linear foot 
said david simonson the does rocky flats manager but a detailed 
lab analysis showed the section contained just 24 grams or 084 of 
an ounce per linear foot he said 
however simonson said an analysis of one section of the duct is 
not enough to say eureka the problem is solved and more 
studies are being done 
in all about 11 pounds of plutonium was estimated to be in the 
air ducts in buildings where plutonium is processed and fabricated 
but officials now think the ducts contain only 2 ounces of 
plutonium 
doe has ordered improvements in filters and filter seals said 
simonson also an additional nine engineers are being assigned to 
safety and ducts containing more than 70 grams or 245 ounces of 
plutonium per linear foot are being removed and replaced

president bush on wednesday signed with 
reservations a bill authorizing 305 billion for defense programs 
for the current fiscal year including a slash in his request for 
the strategic defense initiative 
the measure cuts 11 billion from bushs 49 billion request 
for spending on the sdi program or star wars in the fiscal year 
that began oct 1 
bush in a statement said the measure would provide sufficient 
funds to provide a national defense sufficient to meet 
foreseeable threats to the national security in the coming year 
in signing the bill bush voiced reservations over several 
provisions including one calling on him to persuade nato partners 
to increase their activeduty forces in europe 
he also criticized a section urging him to seek a japanese 
agreement to offset us costs of deploying forces to defend japan 
he said both provisions derogate from the presidents 
authority under the constitution 
bush also took issue with a section requiring him to report to 
congress on any negotiations with us allies on the strategic 
defense initiative claiming it could compromise his authority to 
control sensitive national defense information 
he suggested he might ignore this section as well as some 
others he claimed infringed on his constitutional powers 
the legislation represents the first cut in the sdi program in 
six years 
the bill also trimmed his request for other major strategic 
programs such as the mx and midgetman nuclear missiles and the b2 
stealth bomber 
congress adopted a series of provisions intended to press us 
allies into accepting a greater share of the defense burden 
one amendment calls on japan to boost defense and foreign aid 
spending and requires the president to negotiate an agreement 
providing for japan to completely offset the costs of maintaining 
us forces to defend japanese territory 
a third directs the president to prepare a fiveyear plan for 
the us military presence in south korea including a discussion 
of the feasibility of a reduction in us military personnel 
stationed in the asian nation 
the legislation also reduces the ceiling on the number of us 
troops overseas by about 15000 those troops were associated with 
intermediaterange nuclear weapons which were banned by a 
ussoviet treaty signed in december 1988 
at the pentagon meanwhile officials said they now estimate 
that the effect of the grammrudman deficitcutting law covering 
fiscal 1990 means a 17 billion cut for the agencys spending 
a pentagon spokesman jim turner said it wasnt immediately 
clear what the effect of the cuts would be or how they would affect 
manpower decisions 
turner said the number was a preliminary estimate pending 
formal notification from the office of management and budget 
were still trying to figure out how its all going to fall

most americans think the nation can meet its 
future electricity needs without building more generating plants 
and a large majority oppose expanding use of nuclear energy 
according to poll results released wednesday 
the national survey focusing mainly on energy and environmental 
issues also found that most people believe the federal government 
should put more research focus on renewable energy sources such as 
solar power and less on fossil fuels such as oil 
the poll said a slim majority of americans believe the quality 
of their local environment has neither deteriorated in recent years 
nor will in the near future 
smog global warming and other threats to the atmosphere are the 
most troublesome of the environmental problems facing the nation 
now according to the poll results 
the survey was conducted by vince breglio chief pollster for 
president bushs 1988 campaign and sponsored by the union of 
concerned scientists a public interest group 
in the polling sample of 1200 registered voters interviewed in 
late october and early november 76 percent said the best way to 
meet future needs for electricity is to improve energy efficiency 
rather than building new power plants 
when asked would you favor or oppose a proposal to build more 
nuclear power plants in the united states 45 percent said they 
would strongly oppose it 
seventeen percent described themselves as somewhat opposed to 
more nuclear power 17 percent were somewhat in favor and 16 
percent were strongly in favor four percent didnt know or didnt 
answer 
antinuclear groups said the poll showed the nuclear industry 
in trying to persuade the public of a need for expanded use of 
atomic energy is out of step with most americans 
the results reinforce a longterm trend over the past 14 
years showing increasing opposition to more nuclear power 
development in the united states said scott denman director of 
the safe energy communications council 
the industry says its polls have shown a recent increase in 
public acceptance of nuclear energy 
at a nuclear industry conference in san francisco on wednesday 
utility executives predicted that growing power demands will 
require greater use of nuclear energy 
james j oconnor chairman of chicagos commonwealth edison 
co the nations largest nuclear utility called new nuclear and 
coal plants the ideal way to meet growing power demands 
the breglio poll also said that 63 percent of respondents 
believe their local environment has improved or stayed the same 
over the past three years thirtysix percent said it was not as 
good 
when asked about the coming three years 51 percent said they 
expected their environment to either improve or stay the same 
while 45 percent said it would worsen 
the poll had a margin of error of 3 percentage points

convicted serial killer randy kraft was 
sentenced to death wednesday for a 12year spree of sexual violence 
in which he murdered 16 young men and grotesquely mutilated their 
bodies 
burn in hell kraft the father of 22yearold murder victim 
mark howard hall shouted as kraft was led from court 
kraft 44 insisted he was innocent after orange county superior 
court judge donald a mccartin ordered him put to death in the gas 
chamber relatives of victims cried and hugged each other 
if anyone ever deserved the death penalty hes got it 
coming the judge said recounting the grisly savagery of one 
slaying which included torture by cigarette lighter castration and 
mutilation 
i dont know of any person who could do that to another human 
being said mccartin 
mr kraft took innocent and unsuspecting victims who he 
drugged tortured and mutilated he demonstrated an 
unbelievable aggressive violent tendency toward humanity i just 
cant imagine this violence to satisfy his sexual desires the 
judge said 
kraft was convicted of murders that occurred between 1972 and 
1983 prosecutors said he picked up male hitchhikers in their late 
teens or early 20s gave them drugs and alcohol sexually tortured 
or mutilated them and then strangled them their bodies were dumped 
along roadsides 
california highway patrol officers arrested kraft on may 14 
1983 when they pulled him over for erratic driving and discovered 
a strangled marine from el toro marine corps air station in his car 
i sat here for a year and i didnt see any remorse feelings 
or regret mccartin said it seemed he was in another world 
during this trial 
kraft who played with his pen cap yawned laughed and chatted 
with his lawyer during the proceeding briefly addressed the court 
after sentencing 
i have not murdered anyone and i believe a reasonable review 
of the record will show that said kraft a long beach computer 
consultant 
mccartin imposed the death sentence for 11 murders and 
consecutive life prison terms for the other five murders the judge 
said he did that to keep kraft in custody in case all the death 
sentences were somehow overturned 
a death sentence is automatically appealed to the state supreme 
court 
kraft also was sentenced to 10 years in prison for three counts 
of sodomy four counts of mayhem and three counts of great bodily 
injury 
a jury of 10 women and two men convicted kraft on may 12 after a 
10month trial and recommended the death penalty in august 
deputy district attorney bryan brown mentioned again a list 
found in krafts car which prosecutors believe contains the names 
of 65 murder victims kraft was sometimes called the scorecard 
killer because of that list 
mccartin told kraft he had received letters from parents in 
corona del mar calif and somewhere in iowa whose children 
were missing and wanted to know if there was some way the list 
could divulge their fate he did not give the families names 
mccartin noting he was addressing kraft as an individual and 
not as a judge said if the death sentence appeals fail you might 
give some thought in your waning moments to help those people out 
outside court relatives of victims clasped hands hugged and 
cried 
my vindication will come the day i know hes gone to the gas 
chamber then i can truly say its over said shirley de vaul 
mother of murder victim roger james de vaul jr who was killed at 
age 20 
she and her husband roger sr are sponsoring an initiative 
drive to hasten the judicial process in death penalty cases 
krafts case from arrest to sentencing took six years 
people say the death penalty is not a deterrent sure its not 
a deterrent because its never imposed de vaul said

legislators debated on wednesday 
whether to deny immunity to a fellow member who also is the 
opposition candidate for vice president so he can be prosecuted on 
charges of misusing donations 
a decision is expected this week in the singlehouse national 
assembly which is dominated by the ruling sandinistas on whether 
virgilio godoy should be stripped of the immunity to which 
membership entitles him 
godoy is the running mate of publisher violeta barrios de 
chamorro presidential candidate of the 14party united national 
opposition in the feb 25 elections 
the dispute is over godoys handling of a west german donation 
worth 60000 if the assembly allows him to be tried and he is 
convicted godoy could be expelled from the legislature 
the accusations originated in his own independent liberal party 
but he claims the sandinistas manipulated party members he said it 
is part of a moscowstyle witch hunt with which the sandinistas 
hope to discredit him and the opposition alliance 
what they want to is exhibit me to keep me in the store 
window for several months godoy said this wont end until 
feb 25 
about the possibility of losing his immunity he said let 
them do it those who have lent themselves to this dirty 
maneuvering need to be taught a lesson 
because of infighting among alliance factions mrs chamorro has 
been surrounding herself with a shadow cabinet to counter those 
who conspre against her close advisers 
while she was out of the country earlier this month the 
alliances political committee voted to expel alfredo cesar from 
the campaign directorate opposition sources said it was done 
without mrs chamorros knowledge or consent and while cesar also 
was abroad 
when she returned to nicaragua mrs chamorro appointed cesar as 
the first of what she said would be 10 personal advisers and 
selected two more soon afterward 
the godoy problem involves money and goods given by the 
friedrichnaumann foundation of west germany to a research center 
started by the independent liberal party of which he is president 
some party members said godoy had not given a clear accounting 
of the donation and asked the national assembly to strip him of 
immunity so he could be formally charged and tried 
in a letter the foundation dismissed the allegations of 
mismanagement and demanded a retraction from what it called the 
prosandinista media

washington by ordering managua and havana to cut their support for 
the leftist salvadoran rebels the newspaper said the united 
states backs the rightist salvadoran government 
the newspaper said the soviets were embarrassed by the crash 
last weekend over el salvador of a plane loaded with arms that

national liberation front or fmln was better received in managua 
than havana the newspaper said

though we had nothing to do with these last events the newspaper 
quoted an unidentified nicaraguan leader as saying this 
offensive and this arms shipment were organized by the fmln and 
cuba

attorney general dick thornburgh on wednesday 
abruptly rescinded a bureau of prisons proposal restricting the 
circumstances under which reporters could interview federal 
prisoners 
thornburgh issued a brief statement announcing his decision just 
hours after he had defended the dayold proposal at stormy session 
with reporters who cover the justice department 
reporters sharply questioned the attorney general about the 
regulations accusing the bureau of prisons of seeking to control 
the way news organizations cover conditions in federal prisons 
the regulations published in tuesdays federal register would 
have empowered wardens to refuse to allow reporters to conduct 
further interviews if they failed to seek comment from correction 
authorities about allegations about prison conditions 
under the proposal inmates would have been allowed to be 
interviewed by journalists once a month no more than one interview 
between a prisoner and a reporter could be held each day in any 
facility 
in his statement thornburgh said he ordered the bureau of 
prisons to withdraw the proposed regulations this proposal was 
submitted prematurely and without my personal review it will be 
subject to further review before resubmission the attorney 
general said 
thornburghs spokesman david runkel said the attorney general 
had learned of the regulations tuesday night and decided to rescind 
them wednesday afternoon 
bureau of prisons spokesman james jones said he did not know 
what if any provisions thornburgh found objectionable he said 
the attorney general did not outline specific objections to the 
bureau of prisons when he announced his order 
during the morning session with reporters thornburgh had 
defended the proposal stressing that he had not personally 
reviewed it i think there is a problem that they are trying to 
address of reconciling their management responsiblity with the flow 
of information in and out of prisons thornburgh had said 
lets start from the reductio ad absurdum that any prisoner 
who wants to talk to any reporter at any time can do so the 
attorney general said i find that unacceptable in terms of 
managing a prison population 
the regulations are designed to ensure two things one that an 
accurate flow of information and observe what is necessary to 
properly manage prison facilities 
before it was rescinded the proposal was branded as a form of 
censorship by ed koren an attorney for the american civil 
liberties unions national prison project 
it is certainly an attempt to cut of any kind of criticism and 
to protect the bureau of prisons from any embarrassments koren 
said 
what is particularly obnoxious is that provison that 
requires reporters to come up with a balanced approach on the pain 
of not being able to get further interviews koren said 
the proposed regulations said that reporters have a 
professional responsibility to make a reasonable attempt to verify 
any allegations regarding an inmate staff member or institution 
to ensure an opportunity to gather complete information 
regarding both sides of any issue in the institution a 
representative of the news media as a condition of any 
facetoface interview granted by the bureau shall provide 
authorized staff of the bureau of prisons an opportunity to respond 
to any allegations that might be published or broadcast the 
regulations said 
jones said the policy or requiring reporters to obtain comment 
from corrections officials has been existence for a decade 
all we are asking for is if there are allegations made we get 
a chance to respond 
jones said there is not a whole lot thats new in the 
proposed regulations which were published for public comment 
new elements of the regulations were the proposals to limit the 
number of interviews per institution to one a day and the number of 
meetings an inmate could have with a reporter to one a month jones 
said 
jones said that the new regulations would not have functioned as 
a limit because we determined that the average number of 
interviews per institution a month was five

convicted killer dalton prejean won a stay of 
his midnight execution wednesday from the us supreme court after 
spending the day with his family in the state prisons death house 
prejean 10 days shy of his 30th birthday had been scheduled to 
die in the electric chair for a murder he committed as a teenager 
but the supreme court granted prejeans emergency plea barring 
his execution until the justices decide whether they will hear his 
formal appeal to set aside his death penalty no date has been set 
for the courts action on the formal appeal 
the supreme court had previously turned down three of his 
appeals 
he was 17 when he shot donald cleveland in the face in 1977 
after being stopped for driving with a broken tail light prejean 
had been freed six months earlier from a juvenile detention center 
where he served time for killing a taxi driver when he was 14 
cleveland was the only louisiana state policeman ever murdered 
while on duty 
prejean would have been the first person executed under the us 
supreme courts june ruling that authorizes executions of people 
who commit capital crimes while they were 16 or 17 
prison officials said his mother wife son brother and 
sisterinlaw were among those authorized to visit him 
prejean on death row in louisiana longer than anyone else 
would have been the 19th person executed in louisiana since the 
supreme court upheld the death penalty in 1976 nationwide 119 
people have been put to death 
on tuesday gov buddy roemer rejected a 32 pardon board 
recommendation that prejeans life be spared and the 5th us 
circuit court of appeals denied a ninth stay of execution 
the 5th circuit said that while prejean had low intelligence 
his intelligence quotient was not low enough to call him retarded 
death penalty opponents made prejeans case a national cause 
celebre saying he should be spared because he was nearly retarded 
an iq of 76 and because he was so young when he killed the 
trooper 
the 5th circuit which rejected prejeans appeal said he is not 
retarded under standards of the american association on mental 
retardation which sets the threshhold at an iq of 70 
in the appeals courts 39page opinion chief judge charles 
clark wrote 
to date 11 different lawyers have represented prejean in the 
processing of 20 legal proceedings in 6 different courts before 35

the palestine liberation organization said 
wednesday the united states it is guilty of financial terrorism 
by threatening to cut off funds to the united nations if the 
general assembly calls the plo a nation 
arab diplomats plan to introduce a resolution changing the plos 
status from an observer to a nonvoting nation like north and south 
korea switzerland monaco san marino and the vatican 
the state department says it will halt us payments if the 
general assembly approves the resolution the united states is 
assessed 216 million annually onefourth of the un budget 
zehdi labib terzi the plo representative told a luncheon 
meeting this is another example of financial terrorism 
in rome the un food and agriculture organization ignored us 
threats and voted overwhelmingly wednesday to help the plo teach 
palestinians how to grow food in israelioccupied territories 
the united states said such a policy involved the fao in 
politics and said it would stop funds to the agency if it was 
approved it also has threatened to withdraw from the fao 
we have made it absolutely clear to the fao leadership over 
the last few days that passing the resolution would have serious 
consequences for the organization the state department announced 
a us official said the state department would consult with 
american delegates to fao on their return from rome before 
announcing their next step 
in jerusalem the israeli government condemned the fao action 
in the general assembly a vote on the plo resolution has been 
postponed from friday until next wednesday 
diplomats said privately negotiations were under way on a 
compromise acceptable to both the plo and united states 
on tuesday us ambassador thomas r pickering said we are 
clearly not interested in exploring all the alternatives we are 
interested in finding a way to end this particular silly idea that 
the palestinians can be declared a state here in the united nations 
when they have none of the attributes of a state 
upgrading the plos status would need only a majority vote of 
the 159 general assembly members as a member of the 102member 
nonaligned movement the plo theoretically has more than enough 
votes to prevail 
last year the plo declared an independent state of palestine 
without defining its borders but presumably in the israelioccupied 
west bank and gaza strip and says 117 nations have recognized it

communist party chief egon krenz joined 
leading dissidents wednesday in calling for east germany to remain 
independent as west germany began a worldwide diplomatic push to 
win support for reunification 
krenz insisted that east germany will remain a staunchly 
socialist state sovereign and independent 
the united states already has given its support to uniting the 
germanys whose common border is considered the dividing line of 
east and west and was established after the nazi defeat in world 
war ii 
soviet officials on wednesday rejected a reunificiation plan 
advanced by west german chancellor helmut kohl and said a united 
germany could upset european stability 
west german foreign minister hansdietrich genscher informed 
british officials about the proposal in london wednesday and 
planned a similar stop in paris thursday he will brief the soviets 
on it tuesday in moscow 
about 10000 people marched late wednesday in a communist 
partyorganized rally in leipzig considered a hotbed of 
prodemocracy opposition 
there is no collective guilt of the communist party said 
city party leader thomas bonesky referring to widespread 
corruption being uncovered during the leadership of ousted 
hardline party chief erich honecker 
speakers clearly rejected reunification the official east 
german news agency adn said 
krenz and other east german communist leaders have rejected any 
talk of reunification despite sweeping changes and upheavals in 
this troubled nation he and communist premier hans modrow signed 
an appeal circulated by leading dissidents demanding an east german 
state that offers a socialist alternative to west germany it 
was initiated by writer stefan heym and other east german 
intellectuals concerned about the nations future 
krenz told the organizers in a letter we have the historic 
duty to preserve this country with its antifascist ideals and 
traditions as a socialist alternative within german development 
echoing the petitions sentiments he called for peace and 
social justice individual freedom freedom of travel for all and 
the preservation of the environment 
his government bowing to reform demands already has promised 
free elections by early 1991 and a constitutional amendment 
stripping it of its 40year monopoly on power 
kohl says east germany must hold free elections if it wants west 
german aid and closer ties 
kohl on tuesday outlined his 10point reunification plan which 
received the approval of west germanys opposition social democrats 
kohl discussed his proposal wednesday with president bush in a 
very intensive and complete telephone conversation government 
spokesman hans klein said in bonn 
west germany sent the plan to its embassies worldwide and 
ambassadors were told to deliver it to the host governments and 
explain it klein said 
in rome where soviet president mikhail s gorbachev began a 
state visit on wednesday soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady 
i gerasimov told reporters not one country in europe is anxious 
to see a united germany because it could upset the present 
stability in europe 
he said foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze told italian 
officials that before moscow would reconsider west germany must 
renounce any claim to germanys preworld war ii borders which 
included many areas now belonging to poland the soviet union and 
other border states 
gerasimov deputy yuri a gremitskykh said in moscow that kohl 
presented his proposal without considering the opinions of other 
countries we can clearly see an attempt to shift the movement 
that started in east germany to nationalistic lines 
many europeans fear a reunified germany with a population of 80 
million people would dominate the continent politically and 
economically 
kohl sought to ease such worries tuesday by saying a united 
germany would never again threaten europe 
he did not offer a timetable for reunification but said it 
could take years 
reunification talk began after east germany opened its borders 
and the berlin wall on nov 9 as part of a policy allowing citizens 
to travel freely 
the moves came after thousands fled their homeland and hundreds 
of thousands took to the streets demanding social and political 
reforms 
the party ousted honecker oct 18 and the new leadership has 
begun exposing corruption and abuses by party members 
east german newspapers on wednesday described how former premier 
willi stoph turned a natural park into a private estate 
stoph was sacked from the ruling politburo and resigned as 
premier nov 7 
the official communist party newspaper neues deutschland said he 
had lived surrounded by western luxury on an estate containing 
houses fruit plantations and an indoor swimming pool 
east german opposition groups church leaders and the communists 
are to meet dec 7 for the first round of talks on reform

the air line pilots association expects 
eastern airlines to begin rehiring its members who ended their 
strike last week at the rate of about 100 a month the union 
president said wednesday 
the airline needs some reconciliation with its traditional 
employees to work because its sure not working now said henry 
a duffy alpa president 
duffy speaking at a washington journalism center seminar said 
eastern officials have taken a soft approach in initial 
discussions with pilots and flight attendants who ended their 
support for a machinists strike after eight months off the job 
duffy said he expects eastern to hire back 700 union pilots 
the airline which has about 1800 pilots said it has no 
openings for the returning strikers but might accept some of the 
alpa pilots when openings occur 
about 3500 pilots initially joined the sympathy walkout along 
with 6000 flight attendants some 8500 members of the machinists 
union remain on strike over company demands that they take wage 
cuts and grant other concessions 
duffy said recent alpa defeats including a rejection of union 
representation by federal express employees and the failure of an 
employee effort to take over united airlines have not weakened the 
union 
he blamed a new york bankruptcy court and president bush for 
failure to resolve the eastern strike the court has rejected 
unionbacked efforts to end the strike since eastern filed for 
reorganization bush refused to intervene in the strike and vetoed 
a bill that would have set up a congressional advisory commission 
to help settle it 
duffy said the union is still working with the flight 
attendants union and united airlines management to make a new 
offer that would prevent the airline from being taken over in a 
leveraged buyout 
he said the machinists union which opposed the previous 
managementemployee takeover might be more willing to join a new 
proposal because the share price will be lower uniteds stock fell 
after the deal collapsed helping to trigger the oct 13 stock 
market plunge 
duffy said that although british airways has said it foresees no 
further involvement in the deal it had planned to acquire a 15 
percent interest talks are continuing with several foreign 
carriers who might join the next bid

the communistrun parliament 
swiftly ended the partys 40year monopoly on power on wednesday 
and a politburo member said czechoslovakias first free elections 
since 1948 could be held within a year 
the move was a frantic effort to satisfy the demands of the 
growing prodemocracy movement here 
premier ladislav adamec said he intended to negotiate a 
reassessment of the 1968 warsaw pact invasion that crushed reform 
in czechoslovakia and would be prepared to negotiate the withdrawal 
of soviet troops 
it was the first such statement by a topechelon official 
vasil mohorita a member of the ruling politburo told a news 
conference that now that the communist party has agreed to 
relinquish complete control free elections could be held within 12 
months 
voting with the somber mechanical gestures born of decades of 
rubberstamp approval of communist measures the 309 deputies 
unanimously scrapped article 4 of the constitution which mandated 
the leading role of the communist party they also deleted a clause 
that bases all education on marxismleninism 
the revolution is proceeding much quicker than we expected 
said jiri dienstbier spokesman for the civic forum opposition 
minutes after the vote was broadcast live on national television 
the emergency parliamentary session ended late wednesday the 
soviet news agency tass said 
the changes were among historic concessions the opposition won 
from the communist government on tuesday when adamec also promised 
to form a new government including noncommunists by sunday 
they followed 11 straight days of huge antigovernment 
demonstrations which culminated in a twohour strike on monday in 
which millions of workers participated 
adamec went on national tv and said he had asked civic forum for 
its suggestions on whom to include in the new government 
civic forum proposed the new defense minister be a civilian 
communist and the interior minister who controls the police be a 
civilian noncommunist dienstbier said 
parliament also eliminated the communists leading position in 
the national front an umbrella organization embracing all 
political parties and social groups allowed in czechoslovakia 
state tv later showed slovak actor milan knazko announcing word 
of the changes to a packed national theater in bratislava capital 
of slovakia the entire audience which included prominent 
dissident vaclav havel rose to its feet in thunderous minutelong 
applause 
parliament also planned to consider creating a constitutional 
court and a commission to investigate allegations of police 
brutality in a crackdown on protesters nov 17 
the removal of the requirement that marxismleninism be the 
guiding principle of education was a prime demand of students who 
staged the nov 17 protest and have led the prodemocracy movement 
since 
in parliamentary debate broadcast live on tv for the first 
time deputies openly admitted past party failures and said the 
communists must work hard to win the peoples confidence 
we have betrayed the trust of the electorate and whatever 
laws we pass today will not change this said blanka hykova of 
the socialist party until recently a docile ally of the communists 
anton blazej dean of a communist party training academy said 
we have misunderstood the leading role of the party and its 
position we must regain this trust 
defense minister milan vaclavik a member of parliament sounded 
a cautionary note i am aware that neither the army nor the party 
have the best position now we should be aware that retreats and 
compromises are necessary but there are limits 
alois indra who said tuesday he was quitting as parliament 
president delivered a formal speech of resignation to the 
350member chamber 
he described the resignation as a logical step in the context 
of the present developments 
indra was said to be among party leaders who requested the 
sovietled invasion of august 1968 that crushed the prague 
spring of reform instituted by alexander dubcek then communist 
party chief 
bretislav nedbalek secretary of a preparatory committee said 
czechoslovakias social democratic party had been reestablished 
after an absence of 41 years 
at the vatican pope john paul ii prayed that czechoslovakia 
would use its christian traditions in building its new future 
about 5000 people attended a communistsponsored rally 
wednesday at ostrava an industrial city near the polish border 
including supporters of the opposition group civic forum 
senek milota a local party leader told the rally we dont 
want to eat soup from a charity kitchen an apparent reference to 
the party giving up power civic forum backers jeered loudly but 
no trouble was reported 
the politburos mohorita replied when asked by reporters when 
czechoslovaks would have a chance to vote freely 
first it is necessary to change the laws most probably it 
will take place within a year we dont want the monopoly of one 
party to continue 
party chief karel urbanek said tuesday the communists were ready 
to give up their exclusive control 
despite repeated questions mohorita did not say specifically 
the party would hand over control if it lost free elections but he 
stressed several times were a different party now and you all 
should get used to it 
he conceded the new party leadership chosen last week is under 
pressure from its own 17 million members as well as the 
opposition and said a special party congress tentatively set for 
jan 26 might have to be held sooner 
at a closed meeting of 3500 party activists tuesday night 
urbanek said the future of the party requires giving up the 
monopoly of power and many opposition demands are acceptable the 
official news agency ctk reported 
differences exist he added but we shall have to get used to 
making politics not only with those who agree with you 
urbanek said civic forums demands that the party disband the 
peoples militia its private army and get out of the workplace 
were totally unacceptable however 
civic forum has also demanded the resignation of president 
gustav husak by dec 10 husak who is closely associated with 
dubceks ouster was quoted on ctk as saying he was unwilling to 
step down before his current fiveyear term his third as 
president ends in may

the air force announced wednesday that 50 mx 
nuclear missiles will be removed from underground silos in wyoming 
and placed on trains there and in six other states louisiana 
texas washington north dakota arkansas and michigan 
the announcement represents the bush administrations commitment 
to push ahead with plans to modernize the nations strategic 
nuclear missile force even amid projections of pentagon 
belttightening heightened prospects for armscontrol agreements 
and sweeping changes in the soviet union and its warsaw pact allies 
the 50 missiles dubbed the peacekeeper by former president 
reagan will be placed on 25 trains each with two mx missiles 
aboard the trains will be kept on seven air force bases and moved 
onto civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis 
the air force did not indicate how many of the missiles would be 
at any particular site but did say that warren air force base in 
wyoming will continue to be the main mx operating base 
in a statement the air force said that once the trains are sent 
out they will have access to more than 120000 miles of 
commercial track 
this dispersal will offer enhanced missile survivability in 
the event of an enemy attack providing the potential for prompt 
retaliation vital to the successful deterrence of war the air 
force said 
the bush administration has struggled as had the reagan 
administration to develop a plan for adding a mobile nuclear 
missile to americas arsenal the idea is to make it more difficult 
for the soviet union to target us forces and thus deter the 
soviets from even considering a firststrike attack 
earlier this year president bush opted to move forward with two 
mobile intercontinental ballistic missile systems by putting the 
10warhead mx on trains while also building the smaller 
truckbased midgetman 
bushs decision has run into considerable opposition in congress 
both among those who contend the twoprong program is too 
expensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other 
the cost of taking the nations 50 mx missiles out of their 
underground silos at the wyoming base and building the new 
garrisons or shelters is expected to be at least 56 
billion said a pentagon source who requested anonymity 
hopefully it will be completed by 1994 but that clearly 
depends on the budget the source said 
the pentagon said the missile trains will be housed at these air 
force bases warren and barksdale in louisiana dyess in texas 
fairchild in washington grand forks in north dakota little rock 
in arkansas and wurtsmith in michigan 
ten bases had been under consideration the four rejected were 
eaker in arkansas malmstrom in montana minot in north dakota and 
whiteman in missouri 
a spokesman at the wyoming base maj kathleen mccollum said 
that four of the trains initially would be based at warren with 
the first to be operational by 1992 the base also will serve as 
the training center for the six railgarrison crews she said 
in spokane wash al mangan of the national committee to block 
the mx said local activists would try to block the use of 
fairchild 
bush signed a military spending bill last week that establishes 
a 11 billion fund for both the mx and the midgetman with the 
exact spending split left to defense secretary dick cheney 
the bill also imposes a 50missile cap on the mx 
although cheney at one point said he favored the mx over the 
midgetman the administration has since argued that both systems 
are necessary as the united states engages the soviet union in 
armscontrol talks on strategic weapons the most lethal in the 
superpowers arsenals 
earlier this year white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said 
that moving ahead on both the mx and midgetman missiles would give 
the united states more leverage at the geneva armsreduction talks 
fitzwater said we think a mobile capability is essential 
then you negotiate reductions as best you can 
sen phil gramm rtexas touted the decision as a jobenhancer 
for his state and a chance to save the dyess base from closure as 
the pentagon trims its budget 
railgarrison mx will be the mainstay of our stragetic defense 
well into the 21st century so this is very good news for texas 
gramm said 
sen carl levin dmich who chairs a senate armed services 
subcommittee was quoted last week as casting a doubtful eye on 
money for both the mx and midgetman programs during a time of 
reduced pentagon budgets 
i dont see how we can say with a straight face that were 
going ahead with both of them he said

the company operating a construction crane 
that collapsed and fell 16 stories killing five peoplehas one 
of the poorest safety records in the industry in its home state 
an official said 
erection co of kirkland wash has been fined for safety 
violations at least eight times including four since 1987 
according to washington state department of labor and industries 
records 
in august 1988 it was cited for a serious willful 
violation of state safety laws after a worker fell 123 feet to 
his death said john akins department spokesman erection is 
appealing a 24500 fine he said 
telephone calls to company offices were not returned wednesday 
construction officials said they have no idea why the 240ton 
crane snapped and fell tuesday morning while it was being moved to 
allow work at the top of a 20story highrise being built for the 
federal home loan bank in the citys financial district 
the crane plunged 200 feet to the street whipping into two 
other buildings and smashing vehicles below five people were 
killed and 21 injured 
four of those killed were jacking the crane from the 16th floor 
to the 20th floor of the highrise the other victim was the driver 
of a bus that was taking disabled children to school 
this was not considered a dangerous procedure at all said 
larry duggan a vice president for the projects general 
contractor swinerton amp walberg co of san francisco 
swinerton amp walberg itself has faced criminal negligence charges 
twice before once stemming from another fatal crane collapse 
according to los angeles deputy city attorney michael guarino 
hamilton fairburn deputy chief of the california occupational 
safety and health administration said the investigation of the 
accident is continuing and no possible causes have been eliminated 
fairburn said investigators have given a low priority to wind 
as a factor and referred to the raising of the crane operation 
which was underway when the accident occurred as historically a 
very safe operation 
the coroners office on wednesday identified the dead workers as 
paul cline 49 of renton wash lonnie boggess 45 of tacoma 
wash steve tilton 25 of spanaway wash and david graden 34 
of kirkland wash boggess was at the controls of the crane when it 
collapsed the bus driver was kathleen holden 39 of berkeley 
five people remained hospitalized wednesday one was in serious 
condition three were fair and one was listed as good said gloria 
rodriquez a spokeswoman for san francisco general hospital 
as workers cleaned up the debris wednesday authorities shut off 
the gas supply for 28 businesses in a sevenblock area because of a 
worsening gas leak caused by the crane collapse 
workers clearing away debris found part of the cranes 
counterweight embedded in pavement directly over a main gas line 
the fire department told pacific gas amp electric co to close the 
areas gas supply so the counterweight could be lifted allowing 
officials to survey damage to the 16inch main gas line said pgampe 
spokesman ron rutkowski 
nearly half the customers should get their gas restored by 
thursday after an auxiliary gas line is installed he said 
the huge job of removing debris will probably take at least two 
weeks according to an official in charge of the operation 
it will take that just to pull stuff off the roof said 
barney bloat superintendent of sheedy drayage co 
guarino the los angeles deputy city attorney said charges were 
filed against the construction company after a crane collapsed in 
los angeles in 1981 killing two people the case was dropped 
because prosecutors wanted to prove only culpable negligence but 
state labor code requires proof of wanton and willful disregard for 
human safety guarino said 
in 1986 swinerton was a codefendant with another construction 
company in a case involving an overloaded steel superstructure on a 
21story building in los angeles three ironworkers were killed 
when girders crashed through a floor guarino said 
that case resulted in swinerton agreeing to sponsor a safety 
seminar for downtown los angeles contractors and to make a donation 
to a labor safety board he said 
swinerton did not repond to telephone calls wednesday requesting 
comment on the charges 
akins the washington state labor official said the crane 
subcontractor erection co has one of the poorest safety 
records in the industry in washington 
in november 1988 the company was fined 41000 for numerous 
workersafety violations at an office tower under construction 
said department spokesman dick kunkle 
the san francisco project began in january and has received no 
safety citations swinerton officials said

country for the sake of freedom the mti news agency said 
her whereabouts were not known the agency initially reported 
she had applied for political asylum but later said she had been 
granted a temporary residence permit valid for three days 
at the age of 14 the solemn 4foot11 comaneci astounded the 
world with the firstever perfect scores in gymnastics winning 
three olympic gold medals on the uneven bars balance beam and 
overall competition at the montreal games 
during a career that lasted until 1984 comaneci won 21 gold 
medals in olympic and other international competition after ending 
her competitive career she turned coach and referee and served as 
a role model for romanian youth 
because of her achievements comaneci was made a hero of 
socialist labor by president nicolae ceausescu the hardline 
communist leader who has refused to bend to the wave of reform 
sweeping the east bloc 
at one time she was linked romantically with nicu ceausescu 
the presidents son 
she reportedly lived a comparatively plush life in a country 
notorious for its chronic shortages of consumer goods as well as 
for the ceausescu brand of neostalinism about 25000 romanians 
have fled to hungary the past two years 
despite the adulation of her countrymen and the rewards of her 
government comaneci often expressed dissatisfaction with the 
demands of her career she repeatedly complained of exhaustion 
overtraining and physical disorders as a result of her rigorous 
training and competition schedule 
mti said comaneci complained to hungarian border officials that 
her government had refused to let her work or even travel abroad 
she received the temporary residence permit in szeged a town about 
15 miles from the romanian border

tuesday into hungary by car at the nearby border town of kiszombor

any interviews

an american tour with the romanian gymnastics team 
im ready to help her in any manner if she needs it said 
karolyi who became a us citizen last spring 
her defection is what i was really wishing would happen one of 
these days he said in an interview from clarens switzerland 
where he was coaching the us womens team at an international 
meet 
comaneci is still a big personality in romania she has 
nothing against the romanian population but just like me she was 
chased out of the country by the romanian authorities karolyi 
said 
the coach said he would recommend that comaneci go to the united 
states because of the opportunities there 
officials in washington said there was no immediate indication 
she would try to gain admission to the united states 
i am not aware of anything right now said verne jervis 
spokesman for the us immigration and naturalization service 
comaneci has said in the past that she was offered coaching jobs 
in the west but she did not say where 
patty auer a spokesperson for the us gymnastics federation in 
indianapolis said we have no official word on any offers but 
that wouldnt surprise me there have been no overtures from the 
federation

a cia plane en route from zaire to angola 
carrying military and other equipment for usbacked rebels in 
angola crashed this week killing an undetermined number of 
americans and insurgents government officials said wednesday 
the l100 flight left a military base at kamina in zaire monday 
night and went down not far from the southeastern angolan town of 
jamba where the unita rebels have their headquarters the sources 
said attributing the crash to pilot error 
they said all the americans on board were killed along with 
several unita rebels several others survived said the officials 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the state department said wednesday night that four americans 
were on board but it did not say how many were killed the 
department declined further comment except to confirm that there 
was a crash on monday in a remote section of southeastern angola 
and that the cause was unknown 
asked for comment cia spokesman mark mansfield said as a 
matter of policy we never confirm or deny such reports 
the sources were unable to identify the dead americans but a 
defense department official on tuesday reportedly notified the 
family of james spessard 31 of hagerstown md that he had died 
in a plane crash near zaire 
a family member told the hagerstown morning herald that the 
pentagon official offered very little information about the crash 
spessard is survived by his wife deborah and two small boys 
efforts to reach the family wednesday evening were not successful 
since 1986 the united states has been providing military aid to 
unita in its 14year struggle against the sovietbacked government 
in angola 
us resupply planes secretly have been using zaire as a staging 
area for sending materiel to the rebel forces but zairean president 
mobutu sese seko ordered a halt to this activity last june when he 
launched a peace mediation effort 
during a visit to washington in early october us officials 
convinced mobutu to allow the resupply flights to resume the 
officials said the monday flight was the first since june 
the l100 is a civilian version of the workhorse lockheed c130 
transport powered by four turboprop engines 
randall robinson who heads transafrica a private group seeking 
to influence us policy in africa said the incident in angola 
reinforces his view that us aid to unita should stop 
we have turned this african country into a graveyard 
robinson said american participation in this devastation is 
morally and strategically indefensible 
a ceasefire was agreed to in june between unita and angolas 
mpla government but it was broken in august and there has been 
intermittent fighting since then 
the mpla has been backed by largescale soviet military aid over 
the years and by cuban troops last december however cuba agreed 
to remove its troops over a 27month period that will end in early 
1991 
the angola war is one of several regional conflicts in which the 
united states and the soviet union have been supporting rival 
factions it is expected to be the subject of discussion this 
weekend at the summit meeting in the mediterranean between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail gorbachev 
ironically the cia flight went down just two days after a 
similar type of incident involving a guerrilla resupply flight 
occurred in el salvador there a twinengine cessna originating in 
nicaragua crashed while carrying soviet bloc antiaircraft missiles 
and other equipment reportedly earmarked for leftist rebels in el 
salvador

secretary of state james a baker iii said 
wednesday that the salvadoran governments domestic crackdown was 
an absolutely appropriate response to rebel attacks on us and 
other targets 
earlier white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said when 
asked about the governments crackdown our response is that we 
deplore violence and killing on both sides 
the leftist guerillas briefly overran the home of at least 
one us embassy officer in the early morning outbreak of fighting 
baker told reporters also saying we are taking steps to assure 
the safety of embassy personnel 
administration officials said all the americans escaped injury 
the state department meanwhile set up a 24hour task force to 
monitor the events in el salvador 
the task force said in a statement that the family whose home 
was briefly seized had been safely evacuated by salvadoran 
government forces and that the americans were not actually in 
the hands of the guerrillas at any time 
the rebels appeared to seize this residence at random said 
task force spokesman david denny 
after the predawn attack embassy personnel were told not to 
report to work wednesday and the embassy was closed for the day 
said white house spokesman roman popadiuk 
however said denny several families are unable to leave 
their homes because of fighting in the neighborhoods of san 
benito escalon and san francisco 
us embassy spokesman barry jacobs said in san salvador that a 
charter flight might depart thursday with embassy dependents who 
want to leave embassy personnel who planned to go home for 
christmas would leave early he said 
baker said president bush will press soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev on central america during their shipboard summit this 
weekend in the mediterranean the secretary said bush wants the 
soviet union to make sure its nicaraguan ally adheres to soviet 
assurances to the administration that east bloc weapons will not go 
through managua to the salvadoran rebels 
in paris the newspaper le monde said wednesday that the soviet 
union has told both nicaragua and cuba to stop supplying arms to 
the salvadoran rebels the newspaper said those instructions were 
given to high cubana and nicaraguan officials at a secret meeting 
in managua the nicaraguan capital called by the soviet ambassador 
its in their power to assure themselves that they will not be 
lied to in the future wed like to see them exercise that baker 
said referring to the soviets 
he decried the continuing pattern of soviet arms shipments to 
moscows third world clients saying that in the case of central 
america it was a disturbing approach of throwing fuel on the 
fire 
baker spoke a few hours before it was learned in washington that 
a cia plane carrying equipment to a us thirdworld client the 
unita rebel movement in angola had crashed near jamba angola 
the allout offensive the salvadoran rebels launched on nov 11 
baker said was made possible by soviet arms 
president alfredo cristiani is cracking down in el salvador in 
an attempt to rid the streets of these terrorist guerrillas i 
dont think that thats anything but absolutely appropriate the 
secretary said 
separately cia director william webster told reporters that the 
rebels were continuing to make a symbolic and important statement 
about their ability to keep causing trouble through urban attacks 
but that they posed no threat to cristianis government 
since the rebel offensive began cristianis security forces 
have raided more than a dozen churches and refugee centers and have 
detained labor officials 
last week six jesuit priests were brutally murdered witnesses 
have said uniformed sldiers were seen near the killing site 
in a separate incident seven civilians were lined up and 
executed on nov 18 in a poor san salvador suburb witnesses saw 
government soldiers a block away minutes before the killings 
baker said cristiani and his government understand very well 
that there must be complete respect for human rights in el salvador 
if they expect to contiue to receive united states support 
as to the resurgence of rightwing death squad activity which 
in the past has been linked to cristianis conservative arena 
party baker said i think its important that they do everything 
they can to get control of that kind of activity 
baker was asked by reporters if president bush was contemplating 
any military intervention in light of the latest violence he said 
the president has never ruled out any option that might be 
necessary to protect american lives 
under current congressional restraints the united states can 
provide 55 military advisers as part of its aid to the salvadoran 
government 
the presence of an additional six green berets came to light 
last week when the rebels took over the sheraton hotel in san 
salvador where the elite troops were staying fitzwater said those 
green berets were not part of the 55member contingent butwere on 
special temporary assignment in el salvador 
wednesdays outbreak of fighting occurred in the same affluent 
neighborhood 
regarding the case of connecticut church worker jennifer casolo 
who was arrested by the salvadoran government on sunday on charges 
of harboring weapons fitzwater said us officials have been 
monitoring her case closely to assure she is well treated 
fitzwater said that during her four years in el salvador miss 
casolo had become known to embassy officials through her work 
with christian education seminars and coordinating nonofficial 
delegations to el salvador the embassy will continue to assure 
that she is given every benefit due her under salvadoran law 
rep jim mcdermott dwash who spoke with miss casolo in the 
police barracks where she is held said in seattle she maintained 
her innocence 
a group of americans headed by former attorney general ramsey 
clark planned to fly from miami to san salvador on thursday to see 
her and help slect a salvadoran attorney a spokesman for the group 
said in seattle

a new study by the brazilian space 
research institute shows the entire amazon rain forest could be 
wiped out in 50 to 100 years if deforestation continues at the 
present rate 
carlos nobre an engineer and meteorologist with the institute 
said wednesday the findings were the result of a yearlong study at 
the university of maryland using a supercomputer belonging to nasa 
nobre said he used mathematical formulas to project the effects 
of deforestation which he estimates destroys 14000 square miles 
of rain forest a year 
the computer predicted the huge wilderness could dry up and turn 
into a vast scrubcovered savanna he said 
the advance of pasture land would profoundly change the 
landscape and the way of life in the region the scientist said 
at the institute in sao jose dos campos 200 miles southwest of rio 
nobre said the destruction of trees to clear land for planting 
and grazing reduces the forests capacity to retain water 
as a result temperatures will rise rainfall will diminish and 
the soil will become poorer he said even the water level in 
rivers will fall reducing the hydroelectric potential 
when that happens nobre said the rain forest would succumb to 
a long dry season and turn into a savanna covered with scrub trees 
and grass 
the 2 millionsquaremile brazilian amazon is the worlds 
largest wilderness independent studies show 12 percent of it has 
been destroyed mostly by small farmers and cattle ranchers using 
slashandburn techniques the government claims the correct figure 
is 5 percent 
scientists say destruction of the rain forest adds to the 
greenhouse effect which traps the suns rays and causes global 
warming 
the brazilian government under fire from environmentalists 
recently announced that burnings in the amazon were far less than 
in previous years

a federal grand jury convened wednesday 
to study an engineers allegations that equipment for the space 
shuttles did not get proper inspections after the explosion that 
killed the seven challenger astronauts 
us attorney frank donaldson said he expects the grand jury to 
complete its work by friday and that he is prohibited from 
commenting on anything the panel is examining 
however a spokesman for the thiokol corp formerly 
mortonthiokol at ogden utah steve lawson said the company had 
been asked to provide information about instrumentation in 
redesigned solid fuel booster rocket motors used starting with the 
discovery flight sept 30 1988 
lawson whose company makes solid fuel boosters for the 
shuttles said he could not provide details on what type of 
information had been requested he said the instruments fulfilled 
nasa requirements 
a thiokol engineer dan joos has said there was improper 
testing of booster parts he and employees of at least one thiokol 
subcontractor reportedly were subpoenaed to appear before the grand 
jury 
joos had said that instruments that measure stresses on the 
184footlong boosters were not properly inspected and could be 
giving engineers false information he said that could lead to 
failures of the booster rockets 
nasa suspended shuttle flights and overhauled engines and 
spacecraft after the failure of a booster rocket seal caused the 
challenger explosion 
royce mitchell manager of the solid rocket motor office at 
marshall space flight center in huntsville said his office was 
cooperating in the investigation of joos charges 
jack lee marshalls director said nasa engineers at huntsville 
investigated joos allegations and concluded there were no safety 
issues involved that would require suspending shuttle flights 
the rogers commission that investigated the challenger tragedy 
found that marshall engineers had pushed for the challenger launch 
while ignoring booster problems 
jr thompson nasas deputy administrator and marshall director 
during the booster redesign work said he was unaware of joos 
concerns or the grand jury probe 
i dont know what theyre talking about because all flights we 
have made since challenger have gone exceptionally well he said 
in washington 
porter bridwell manager of marshalls shuttle projects office 
said his engineers and nasas inspector general began looking into 
joos concerns about a month ago he said they felt sure they 
werent related to safety issues

sir anthony meyer a rankandfile member of the 
governing conservatives was nominated for party leader wednesday 
in the first challenge to prime minister margaret thatcher since 
she took over the partys top post 14 years ago 
the challenge comes at a time of sagging popularity for mrs 
thatchers leadership opinion polls published sunday showed the 
conservatives trailing opposition labor by as much as 14 points 
however meyer who handed in his nomination papers wednesday 
evening said he had no idea how much support he would get 
all i want to do is to give people the opportunity to vote 
he told reporters it is for them to make up their own minds 
mrs thatcher ousted former prime minister edward heath as party 
leader 14 years ago 
the 64yearold prime minister has led the conservatives to 
three successive election victories since 1979 she is the 
longestserving british prime minister this century 
nominations for the party leadership close at noon thursday the 
results of voting by the 375 conservatives in the 650member house 
of commons are due to be announced tuesday 
conservative lawmakers vote annually on their leader but mrs 
thatcher has been endorsed unopposed since defeating heath in 1975 
mrs thatcher complained monday that the challenge to her 
leadership was causing damaging uncertainty 
labor moved ahead of the conservatives in the polls in the 
spring amid widespread dissatisfaction over rising inflation and 
intended changes in the national health service 
 
when meyer a 69yearold former diplomat announced his 
candidacy last week he said he would withdraw if a more senior 
party member would run against mrs thatcher but none has come 
forward 
under party rules the identities of meyers nominator and 
seconder are not disclosed 
under a complicated voting formula mrs thatcher needs 57 
percent of the votes cast to win outright if she fails other 
candidates are expected to enter the race for a second ballot 
meyer opposes the sale of stateowned water utilities he wants 
better pensions for war widows and believes mrs thatcher should be 
more enthusiastic about european economic integration

soon after ferdinand marcos was deposed as 
philippine leader in 1986 his wife appealed to nancy reagan for 
white house intervention in their legal affairs according to 
government documents made public wednesday 
in a dearest nancy letter dated sept 11 1986 imelda 
marcos asked mrs reagan to help her avoid iving a deposition in a 
civil racketeering lawsuit brought in a california court by the 
philippine government against the marcoses 
i understand that a suggestion from the white house or the 
state depart could prevent these indignities to an ally and 
friend mrs marcos wrote 
whether mrs reagan responded is not known but mrs marcos 
later did give the deposition invoking her fifth amendment rights 
the philippine case which is still pending seeks to recover money 
allegedly stolen from the philippine government by the marcoses for 
personal use 
mark weinberg a spokesman for the reagans in los angeles said 
wednesday that it was the reagans longstanding practice not to 
comment on pending legal matters 
the letter was contained in the governments response papers to 
numerous pretrial motions brought by mrs marcos lawyers in her 
pending criminal indictment 
mrs marcos has pleaded innocent to charges that she and her 
late husband siphoned nearly 200 million from the philippine 
treasury and funneled it into this country for the purchase of new 
york real estate and art she is scheduled to go on trial in 
manhattans federal court march 14 
the government papers also revealed that prosecutors 
investigated charges that marcos embezzled 15 million in us 
government funds that had been designated for use by the philippine 
government the money from the us agency for international 
development allegedly was deposited into a swiss bank account 
controlled by marcos 
assistant us attorney charles labella said wednesday that the 
embezzlement allegations were not contained in the racketeering 
indictment brought against the marcoses in october 1988 
mrs marcos letter was included to undercut her contention that 
she and her husband were kidnapped from the philippines by the 
us government in february 1986 after marcos was ousted as leader 
in the letter mrs marcos thanks the reagans for their 
hospitality 
labella said mrs marcoss abduction allegation was an absurd 
claim she transforms history into fairy tale 
marcos does not acknowledge that the united states government 
evacuated her amidst crowds of antimarcos demonstrators but 
contends instead that the united states government ousted her from 
power through force and deception labella said in his papers 
mrs marcos is seeking to have the charges against her dropped 
because of the abduction claim 
the government papers also revealed that the marcoses declined 
to provide any tax information to the united states government in 
1986 and 1987 because they claimed they were brought to the country 
against their will 
in addition to mrs marcos letter the prosecutor included a 
letter from ferdinand marcos to president reagan which had 
previously been made public 
in that letter dated june 9 1988 marcos who died in 
september at the couples home in exile in honolulu asks the 
president to block the criminal indictment against the marcoses and 
then thanked the president for his hospitality over the last two 
years 
marcoss letter which was typewritten and addressed to mr 
president was much more formal than mrs marcoss appeal to mrs 
reagan in which she describes the pain and humiliation of the 
couples legal problems 
i dont think i have enough strength left to bear up with all 
these she wrote therefore i ask your invaluable help to 
prevent a deposition on me and with a clear conscience i am 
optimistic of justice and your understanding 
the letter was signed much much love imelda

the son of bmovie actress susan cabot was 
given a threeyear suspended sentence and placed on probation 
wednesday for the beating death of his mother 
timothy scott roman originally was charged with murder in the 
1986 bludgeoning death of miss cabot 59 who appeared in such 
1950s films as machine gun kelly with charles bronson and 
tomahawk with rock hudson 
the sentencing of roman ended an unusual pair of trials marked 
by testimony that roman born a dwarf suffered brain damage from 
growth drugs and allegations roman was the illegitimate son of 
jordans king hussein 
roman 25 of encino was convicted last month of involuntary 
manslaughter in a second trial conducted without a jury before 
superior court judge darlene schempp the first trial ended in a 
mistrial when romans attorney became ill 
the case is a real tragic one its hard to walk out and say 
youre happy with the result said romans second attorney 
michael white he loved his mother and is relieved in the 
knowledge he doesnt have to go to jail and can get on and live his 
life 
miss cabots body was found dec 10 1986 after roman called 
police to the dilapidated encino home they had shared she had been 
beaten with a barbell 
roman initially told officers that he had been beaten 
unconscious by a man dressed as a ninja warrior and awoke to find 
his mother dead but in court he admitted he had fabricated the 
story and pleaded innocent by reason of insanity 
in the second trial roman testified his mothers mental state 
had badly deteriorated and that she had initiated the violence by 
swinging the barbell at him he said he didnt remember what had 
happened next 
the involuntary manslaughter charge carried a maximum fouryear 
prison term but schempp handed down the threeyear prison term 
which she then suspended 
romans defense attorney in the first trial chester smith 
argued part of the insanity defense was based on side effects roman 
suffered from experiments with drugs undertaken to boost his growth 
smith in arguing his client was at risk in jail said roman 
might be the illegitimate son of king hussein and could have been a 
terrorist target 
susan cabot briefly dated king hussein in the 1950s

assistant us attorney ernst mueller the lead prosecutor said 
ms nacel who faced up to 15 years imprisonment had cooperated

about three years later in haiti

a shoe a fire extinguisher a headset life jackets seat cushions 
and a box with a new england airlines label officials said

helmut kohl dazzled his countrymen 
with his vision of a united germany within a united europe but 
east germanys leaders apparently see kohls ideas as something of 
a trojan horse laden with suspicious cargo 
kohl on tuesday outlined a 10point plan to gradually unite the 
two german states saying he wants reunification but acknowledging 
it could take time 
the chancellor wrapped his ideas into a farreaching concept of 
overcoming the overall divisions of europe stepping up disarmament 
and forging closer links between the european economic community 
and eastern europe 
kohls proposals are specific in some areas but appear general 
enough to save him from criticism at home that he is being too 
meddlesome in east german domestic affairs

the cost of new weapons and decreasing defense 
budgets are forcing more countries including some nato members to 
upgrade their armored vehicles rather than buy new ones a new 
janes yearbook said today 
nato countries are concentrating their upgrading on improving 
fire control systems and providing an enhanced night vision 
capability said the authors of the 19891990 edition of janes 
armored fighting vehicle systems 
few countries are at present installing new armament which is 
required to penetrate the latest soviet mbts main battle tanks or 
to install more armor to increase their battlefield 
survivability wrote christopher foss and tony cullen in the 
authoritative yearbook 
they said the installation of a larger caliber gun and 
additional armor would in most cases overload the vehicles 
suspension and reduce the powertoweight ratio

martin landau stars as the money man behind 
the turbulent development of a small nevada desert town into a 
gambling oasis in the showtime miniseries the neon empire 
the twopart drama traces efforts by new york gangster junior 
moloff to turn las vegas into a sophisticated mecca for gambling 
and prostitution in the 1940s the first twohour segment appears 
sunday and the second part on monday 
landau plays new york mobster max brower a character based on 
meyer lansky and ray sharkey is the volatile moloff based on 
bugsy siegel 
lansky was a brilliant man who was consulted not only by 
gangsters but by businessmen as well said landau he was able 
to see into the future lucky luciano often wouldnt make a move 
without consulting lansky 
lansky saw it as a business drug traffic was something he 
wanted no part of he was also against prostitution he wanted to 
stop at gambling and booze he was a man who could be trusted if 
you played by the rules he could be very dangerous if you stepped 
outside the rules 
the neon empire written by journalistnovelist pete hamill 
also stars gary busey linda fiorentino dylan mcdermott julie 
carmen harry guardino and richard brooks larry peerce directed on 
location in los angeles and arizona 
i play max brower rabbinically said landau like a rabbi 
but a deadly one hes a man you can talk to do business with 
like lansky hes the man who ties the jewish mobs and the italian 
mafia together 
bugsy siegel was a man who was emotionally wild lansky had to 
keep him under control siegel was later killed in los angeles 
landau worked on the neon empire in june and july after 
completing work on woody allens crimes and misdemeanors next 
he worked in by the dawns early light for home box office he 
also stars in max and helen for tnt 
hes probably best remembered as rollin hand the master of 
disguise in the tv series mission impossible his former 
wife barbara bain was cinnamon carter they later starred in the 
syndicated series space 1999 
many people believe that landaus role as dr judah rosenthal in 
crimes and misdemeanors will bring him his second nomination 
for an academy award he was nominated as best supporting actor 
last year for tucker the man and his dreams 
my role is the biggest male protagonist woodys ever written 
outside of his own roles he said he usually writes his own 
role and a role for a female protagonist i dont want to say too 
much about my role but what happens after people see it is 
fascinating it resonates for days afterward ive never been in a 
movie that affects people that powerfully 
landau a native of brooklyn studied art at the pratt institute 
and at the age of 18 became assistant to cartoonist gus edson in 
drawing the gumps he also illustrated billy roses pitching 
horseshoes column 
the gumps was the most popular comic strip in the country at 
one time landau said i drew the lettering and the backgrounds 
for the daily strip the sunday strip had a separate story and i 
did the story and all the drawing from conception to finish you 
could create your own little world in cartooning i could create 
little oneact plays 
nevertheless landau quit after winning an audition to the 
actors studio the only other actor accepted at that time was steve 
mcqueen 
the role in mission impossible was created for landau by 
bruce geller a writer who had studied acting in a class taught by 
landau the character was originally called martin land landau 
thought that was too obvious and geller changed it to martin hand 
the name used in the pilot 
space 1999 came after the star trek series but before 
the star wars movies landau was one of the astronauts on moon 
base alpha who were pushed into outer space when atomic waste 
stored on the moon went critical and acted as a propellant as they 
passed through various solar systems the astronauts kept checking 
for a liveable planet and were checked out in turn by curious 
otherworldly creatures 
the show was created for abc but instead became a pioneer in 
firstrun syndication it inspired norman lear to put mary 
hartman mary hartman into syndication 
after that landau did not have a major film role until 
tucker 
i was working but i was doing mindless pictures he said 
i always believed a good role would come along it did when 
francis ford coppola cast me in tucker 
next he will produce and play a role in the film adaptation of 
kurt vonneguts breakfast of champions

tourists dream of instant wealth at 
north americas only diamondmining park but companies with the 
same hopes for the crater of diamonds state park have 
environmentalists worried 
this land belongs to the public and should be preserved not 
used to line somebodys pockets said jim stanley a little rock 
attorney representing the sierra club part of a coalition of 
environmental groups threatening legal action to stop the potential 
exhaustion of a unique natural resource 
retiree james archer is a regular among the 700 visitors a day 
who sweat and swear on diamond digs for just a 3 admission ticket 
archer 64 shovels clumps of dirt into a wirescreened pan then 
dunks it vigorously in a large tub of water allowing heavy 
material diamonds he hopes to settle most of his pans turn up 
nothing and others produce diamonds the size of a pinhead but for 
the discoverer even small stones carry the satisfaction of 
tiffanys finest 
i dont care if i find a big diamond archer said i just 
want to keep adigging 
the largest diamond found at the park was a 40carat 33point 
lightpink stone unearthed in 1925 by miners and dubbed uncle 
sam the largest found by a tourist was a 16carat 37point 
white stone dug up in 1975 
the state has moved cautiously in its authorization of 
commercial core drilling on the 35acre field in southwestern 
arkansas gov bill clinton in 1986 appointed a diamond mining 
advisory task force to study the idea of mining at the park and 
the state parks and tourism commission distributed paperwork to 
more than 50 companies or individuals who might be interested 
it has forced us to ask a lot of questions about what we 
really want out of the only resource of its kind in the us 
said richard davies the acting director of the parks and tourism 
department 
it also made us realize that we made some strategic mistakes 
at the park because the crater is not very userfriendly a 
35acre plowed field where people can look for diamonds is 
inaccessible to the handicapped and doesnt have water fountains 
restrooms or other amenities 
the commission voted last month to work with four companies who 
will share the estimated 350000 cost of initial studies plus the 
cost of any litigation test drilling could begin by april if the 
process is not delayed by a lawsuit by the sierra club and the 
friends of the crater of diamonds 
this is something completely new in mineral exploration 
said john morgan a consulting engineer who served as a state 
adviser you have four companies cooperating with the state to 
conduct tests in the most effective manner normally they would be 
slitting each others throats 
should the state decide to allow mining only the companies 
paying for the initial studies will be allowed to seek digging 
rights davies said i think a lot of these companies are used to 
spending money on a gamble 
environmentalists who attended an earlier commission meeting at 
which preliminary core drilling was approved say even those tests 
could mean diamonds arent forever at the park we see this as a 
footinthedoor type thing if they get the test drilling in 
there it defeats the principle of inviolacy of park lands said 
stanley the sierra club attorney 
its a loselose situation if the results come back and they 
say there are lots of diamonds there may be incredible pressure to 
open it to commercial mining if they come back and say its a dry 
hole then much of the mystique of the park may disappear 
we prefer to leave a little bit of the aura of mystery out 
there 
to allow tests the interior department had to grant a 
temporary nonrecreational use of the diamond field this is 
a political decision said dean banks coordinator of friends of 
crater of diamonds state park 
past drilling has shown that the diamondbearing ore goes down 
at least 205 feet six to 10 feet of earth have been scraped away 
in 50 years so the park could last centuries said superintendent 
jim cannon no projections have a commercial site in production 
past about 50 years he said 
cannon 39 doesnt like to talk politics but he does like to 
brag about the crater where he has been in charge since 1973 
personally im cautious about any major changes in the park that 
would have a major impact and this certainly would have a major 
impact he said of testing 
attempts for more than a century to commercially mine diamonds 
at the site have flopped he said because of a lack of experience 
or capital the mine was idle when the state acquired it for 
750000 in 1972 
bad luck and bad feelings also figured in past failures cannon 
said one fatherson team found itself facing 36 lawsuits after a 
year in operation and their mining plant was gone after three 
mysterious fires in one night 
the four companies that will take part in the studies are 
continental diamonds 51 percent owned by galactic resources ltd 
of vancouver canada arkansas diamond development co owned by 
sunshine mining co and exdiam inc both of dallas and rhombus 
inc of little rock capricorn diamonds of west perth australia 
and kennecott inc of salt lake city 
such companies may offer improved technology and big backing 
according to cannon even so theyre gambling just like the 
hopeful tourists who slog through the often muddy field bearing 
shovels and pans 
its a combination of curiosity and quick riches gambling 
an idea of buying a 3 ticket and perhaps finding something of 
untold worth

trade negotiators have haggled over cars clothes 
phones skis electrical switches oranges beef semiconductors 
supercomputers wood you name it trying to shrink the stubborn 
us deficit with japan 
after more than 20 years of pressure and persuasion and some 
recent improvement in the trade balance washington is zeroing in 
on what many experts say has been the issue all along real 
progress depends on changing the way the japanese do business 
japans systems for buying and distributing goods are the 
biggest obstacle facing us manufacturers who export or do 
business in japan rk morris director of international trade 
policy for the national association of manufacturers recently told 
a us senate committee in washington 
with japan accounting for 40 percent of the us trade deficit 
last year the imbalance hasnt fallen as far as it should have 
given the weakening of the dollar against the yen us officials 
say 
behind the arcane trade rules once used to keep imports out lies 
an even more formidable challenge keiretsu or networks of 
financial and personal ties that bind japanese subcontractor to 
manufacturer to wholesaler to retailer in almost impenetrable 
alliances 
us officials expressed disappointment after talks in 
washington in november at which japanese officials said they would 
advise firms to end practices keeping foreign companies out of 
their market but warned that quick change was unlikely 
there was very little flexibility in the japanese government 
position in reaching common ground on the nature of the 
problems even problems which appear to be widely recognized in 
japan us assistant treasury secretary charles dallara said 
after the talks 
japans insular exclusive business culture and the lifestyle 
and tastes of its discriminating consumers lie outside government 
jurisdiction 
in most cases but certainly not all a foreigner hoping to sell 
to japan no longer faces obvious legal barriers us officials 
say quotas and excessive duties on alcohol beef citrus and many 
other products have been negotiated out of existence 
vociferous complaints and lengthy trade talks also have helped 
to end the strange restrictions like those that once judged 
foreignmade skis unsuitable for japanese snow 
instead foreign and japanese businessmen trying to sell new 
products here face alliances of japans most powerful firms led 
by mitsui mitsubishi sumitomo fuyo fuji sanwa and daiichi 
kangyo each with its own banks retailers and real estate 
insurance and manufacturing companies 
these are the keiretsu and there are some 30 smaller ones 
as well through interlocking holdings they own more than 70 
percent of shares on japans stock markets 
cartels by any other name the keiretsu enable competing 
manufacturers to fix prices and divide markets among themselves 
activities that would be illegal under antitrust laws in the united 
states or europe but provoke only mild government warnings here 
according to a study by the american chamber of commerce in 
japan almost 48 percent of home electronics in japan are sold 
through exclusively affiliated stores and 99 percent of cars are 
distributed through exclusive dealerships 
the keiretsu are looser versions of the industrial combines or 
zaibatsu of wartime japan 
japans commercial armies are the nations economic defense 
only japanese products carry the guarantee of being returned to the 
wholesaler if they dont sell imports dont through such 
arrangements japanese manufacturers keep 16 million retailers in 
business the united states with 25 times the area and twice the 
population has only 14 million 
the japanese retailer survives this inefficiency by charging the 
worlds highest prices 
a recent survey by the japanese and us governments found 84 of 
122 items priced in both countries were excessively expensive in 
japan including food wine cosmetics bed linens golf clubs and 
spark plugs 
americans in contrast paid more for ketchup perfume table 
china household batteries and japanesemade electronics goods 
some people think sonys and panasonics are cheaper in the united 
states but the surveyors did find bargains at discount stores in 
japan 
surprisingly pressure for change has come not from japans 
longsuffering consumers but from foreigners and other 
outsiders new japanese entrants into established markets 
largescale retailers are fighting the regulations that limit 
their expansion to protect small stores industrialists are calling 
for opening japans farm markets even some rice farmers in japans 
most productive areas confident of their ability to compete have 
begun to rail against government restrictions 
supporters of change have found a willing but quiet ally in 
japans antimonopoly watchdog the fair trade commission which 
has long done little but issue warnings to violators of antitrust 
laws 
in recent months the fair trade commission has fined 
contractors involved in a price cartel investigated price gaps 
between japan and other countries and issued warnings to computer 
manufacturers that bid one yen less than a penny to win 
contracts from local governments 
the commission last year recommended steps to encourage more 
supermarkets and department stores which tend to import more than 
mom and pop shops it said they should be allowed to have more 
floor space and stay open past 7 pm the normal closing time 
the panel recommended deregulating sales of alcohol and lifting 
other government controls that limit competition and drive up 
prices in the airline banking insurance and transport industries 
us officials say a myriad of restrictions most not apparent 
until they are violated by foreign exporters exist at all levels 
of the japanese economy 
japan faces possible retaliation under the us super 301 trade 
bill for tariffs and housing standards that limit imports of wood 
products and for government procurement policies that limit 
purchases of usmade supercomputers and satellites 
recent trade figures indicate foreign firms are making inroads 
here despite the odds japans prices mean high profits for those 
importers who manage to crack the barriers and more are acquiring 
the expertise to do so 
the us deficit with japan remains high it is expected to be 
about 50 billion this year compared to 55 billion in 1988 and 
almost 60 billion in the peak year of 1987 according to us 
commerce department figures 
but us exporters are trying harder american exports to japan 
so far this year are up almost 19 percent 
japan is importing more finished highervalue products that can 
make a bigger dent in the surplus than cheap raw materials in 
1980 only 22 percent of japans imports were finished products in 
1988 almost half were according to finance ministry figures 
despite high costs language and cultural barriers and 
difficulties in recruiting top employees many foreign companies 
have done very well in the japanese market

soap contac cold medicine pampers disposable diapers snickers

breaking into the lucrative japanese market isnt 
impossible but it isnt easy either consider snickers 
for mars co putting snickers mars bars and mampms within reach 
of japanese consumers required a mindboggling expenditure of 
time and money said kiyoshi ide senior managing director of 
mars japanese subsidiary master foods kk 
the breakthrough also required an alliance with one of japans 
giant trading companies mars leaped over japans formidable 
barriers by using mitsubishi corps extensive contacts to place 
its candy bars at subway kiosks and in grocery stores 
mars began selling candy in japan in 1987 while the company 
wont divulge sales figures it said surveys show snickers share 
of the chocolate bar market is growing from its small base faster 
than that of any other brand 
foreign companies attempting to sell in japan have to hurdle 
government barriers including murky rules and regulations import 
duties fair trade price laws that limit sales promotion 
activities and complex import procedures 
but the mazelike distribution system rigidly controlled by 
wholesalers is a particular hindrance to importers because it 
typically increases prices up to four times after japanese 
distributors add on their markups 
for status products the climb is even steeper the 
wholesale price of a bottle of hennessys vsop cognac is 7 but by 
the time it hits store shelves it is 7750 
consider the imported necktie 28 to the import agent who 
sells it to a wholesaler for 56 who sells it to a department 
store for 70 which displays it beautifully and gets 112 from the 
customer 
the distribution system is under scrutiny by japanese and us 
trade negotiators in talks on the two nations structural barriers 
to trade 
simply finding someone to distribute new products in japan often 
is impossible because of exclusive longstanding relationships 
between wholesalers and retailers sole import agents although 
easier to find limit a products sales 
amway corp the american directsales company is doing a 
booming business here its secret it imported its own distribution 
system 
the company offers household items toiletries and cookware 
through its network of 500000 japanese distributors who sell 
through personal contacts from their homes a phone call to one of 
amways three modern distribution centers will produce an item 
within 72 hours says peter scacco of amway 
amway is the fastestgrowing foreign company in japan according 
to a study by the nomura research institute with sales of more 
than half a billion dollars last year 
tiffany and co boosted its japanese sales 38 percent last year 
working through the equally upscale mitsukoshi ltd as its sole 
distributor 
blue diamond growers sellers of california almonds broke into 
the market after 15 years by piggybacking onto cocacola japans 
independent distributors which deal with 12 million outlets 
bmw got around the astronomical price of land for car lots by 
seeking out people who owned land where dealerships could be set 
up then training the landowners to be dealers riding a 
consumption binge the west german automaker is approaching its 
target of 1 percent of the car market 
us executives in japan concluded in a recent study that new 
companies whether foreign or domestic are the targets of a kind 
of inbred discrimination 
even a japanese company with a new product has trouble 
penetrating the japanese distribution system said william best 
of the management consulting firm at kearney international who 
headed the study by the american chamber of commerce in japan 
because the japanese put so much stock in powerful companies 
with famous names wholesalers and retailers are uncomfortable with 
fledgling enterprises 
without name recognition it is very difficult to get 
wholesalers to accept your products into the distribution system 
and to get retailers to put them on the shelves best said 
just because youre unknown you wont get the kind of 
opportunity you would get in the united states market 
best said the us government and japanese leaders face an 
uphill battle in trying to change the way people think about 
business relationships 
these attitudes cant be legislated away best says 
but some changes loom recent trends include retailers importing 
directly from us suppliers and development imports 
development imports custom products for which materials 
quality levels design and processing methods are specified by 
japanese companies that then import the finished products into 
japan are among supermarket chain jusco co ltds most common 
type of import says chikashi honma general manager of the 
international merchandising division at jusco 
issetan an elegant department store is also creating 
privatelabel products this way analysts say this trend will 
continue because the goods can be sold cheaper than domestic 
products 
there are a number of new channels and smart us businessmen 
will do the market research to find the right distribution 
network says one analyst

the us trade deficit after improving for 
six months deteriorated slightly to 2775 billion in the third 
quarter fed by the nations appetite for imported goods and by 
flat exports the government said 
analysts do not see much improvement in the near future imports 
may drop somewhat because of a slowing us economy they said 
tuesday but exports also are likely to fall because of a strong 
dollar and moderating economies overseas 
the commerce department said the gap between imports and exports 
edged up 07 percent in the julyseptember quarter from the second 
quarters 2755 billion

a shrinking labor pool will be the biggest 
problem confronting us businesses in the coming year according 
to a report by the conference board 
the businessresearch group said tuesday its human resources

the ceiling on the size of singlefamily home 
loans purchased by the nations secondary mortgagemarket agencies 
is declining by 150 to 187450 next year the first drop in at 
least a decade the government said 
lenders usually charge interest rates a quarter to a 
halfpercentage point lower on mortgages they sell on the secondary 
market compared with loans that exceed the limit 
the federal national mortgage association fannie mae announced 
the drop tuesday in its limit based on october data collected by 
the federal housing finance board which said the average home 
purchase price was 136800 in the month down from 136900 a year 
earlier 
the federal home loan mortgage corp freddie mac followed with 
a later announcement saying it too was dropping its ceiling for 
singlefamily homes to 187450 effective with mortgage contracts 
signed after jan 1 
together the two congressionally chartered but publicly owned 
agencies help finance nearly one in four of the nations 
residential mortgages they purchase mortgages from lenders and 
repackage them into bondlike securities for investors 
robert m otoole senior vice president at the mortgage bankers 
association of america a trade group said the agencies should 
have used their discretion and left the ceiling unchanged the 
slight drop will affect few homebuyers but he complained it sets a 
bad precedent and will prove somewhat disruptive for lenders 
according to fannie mae mortgages purchased in the first nine 
months of this year averaged 83000 only 5 percent exceeded 
168700 the previous years limit 
in the past few years rapid increases in the ceiling have 
helped buyers in highpriced markets obtain a lower interest rate 
this year home prices have cooled in expensive new york and new 
england markets but they continue to climb at doubledigit rates 
in california 
the ceiling was 115000 in 1985 133250 in 1986 153100 in 
1987 168700 in 1988 and 187600 in 1989 
the 1990 decline in the index certainly indicates that home 
prices have flattened out a little bit it probably is a reasonably 
accurate reflection of whats happened in the real estate market 
otoole said 
it is the first decline since the index was established in 1980

stock certificates should be replaced by 
electronic records of stock ownership to speed up the process of 
trading securities according to experts on financial markets 
greater use of computerized record keeping for securities 
transactions is part of a plan to shorten the period for settling 
us corporate securities trades to three business days from the 
current five 
the plan stems from recommendations to reduce settlement periods 
worldwide made earlier this year by the group of thirty a private 
international research organization 
the londonbased groups recommendations were aimed at 
improving and harmonizing clearance and settlement systems in the 
worlds securities markets to reduce risks and transaction costs as 
well as increase liquidity and efficiency 
the group of thirtys recommendations were evaluated by a us 
study committee which prepared a report a summary of the report 
was released tuesday copies are being distributed to executives at 
us investment firms and banks 
the us study committee urged an extensive educational 
effort by industry trade groups and securities firms to accustom 
investors to do without certificates and accept an electronic book 
entry system the committee expects the conversion could be 
accomplished by 1992 
under the plan once the new system is in place existing 
certificates would be withdrawn from circulation when stocks are 
sold and reissued as book entries 
us treasury securities and mutual funds already are sold to 
retail investors in bookentry form about a third of all newly 
issued municipal bonds are sold as book entries and some corporate 
bonds are also 
the study committee said the switch to a bookentry system could 
entail sweeping changes in securities firms backoffice operations 
and might require legislation to be put into effect 
but the committee concluded that the cost savings would far 
outweigh the expense of implementation 
cost cuts would be welcome during the current slump in 
securities trading activity and industry profitability the 
committee said in its report

thrift regulator m danny wall does not plan 
to heed the latest call for his resignation his spokesman said 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called for 
walls departure monday but said he might not be to blame for the 
problems of the savings and loan industry 
wall declined to respond to mitchells statement but his 
spokesman william fulwider said tuesday the senators complaint 
is hardly grounds for asking for his resignation 
he has no plans to resign fulwider said 
meanwhile the leaders of three advocacy groups said they will 
demand today that wall quit they are jim davidson chairman of the 
national taxpayers union joan b claybrook president of public 
citizen a group founded by consumer activist ralph nader and alan 
l keyes president of citizens against government waste 
they will be joined by bert ely an alexandria va analyst 
frequently at odds with wall over estimates of the sampl industrys 
losses 
rep henry b gonzalez dtexas chairman of the house banking 
committee has written to president bush suggesting that wall step 
aside the presidents response has been less than warm support 
if part of the savings and loan problem proves to be 
management or regulation people that arent aggressive enough the 
answer will be yes bush said when asked about gonzalez letter 
gonzalez committee has been investigating the collapse of 
lincoln savings and loan association of irvine calif expected to 
become the nations largest sampl failure at a cost to taxpayers of 
2 billion 
the panel charges that wall ignored a recommendation to seize 
lincoln and stem its losses two years before the thrift was taken 
over 
wall maintains that there was insufficient evidence to legally 
take that action nevertheless pressure has been building for him 
to quit 
the wall street journal called for his resignation in an 
editorial this week and according to industry sources who spoke 
on condition of anonymity white house advisers led by counsel c 
boyden gray are pushing for walls ouster 
however an administration source who also spoke on condition 
of anonymity said wall enjoys some support within the treasury 
department which counts on his vote on the fivemember board 
governing the federal deposit insurance corp an independent 
agency which insures bank and sampl deposits 
under sampl legislation passed in august walls term extends 
until july 1 1991 he previously served as chairman of the federal 
home loan bank board but under the new laws regulatory

the head of british airways says he has no 
plans for further attempts to buy an interest in united airlines 
but said his company still wants to become the first truly global 
airline 
british airways chairman lord king said tuesday the united 
states and the european community should merge into one trading 
bloc beginning with open skies for airlines on both sides of the 
atlantic 
king criticized two bills in congress that would give 
transportation secretary samuel skinner increased power to stop 
foreign control of us carriers skinner also opposes the 
legislation saying he already has enough power to limit foreign 
involvement in us aviation 
king speaking on the eve of britishus talks over the 
possible revision of bilateral air service agreements said that 
despite his call for open skies he wont advocate any further 
opening of routes or investments to us carriers in europe without 
reciprocal benefits 
i am not advocating and will not practice unilateral 
commercial disarmament king told a group of us and british 
business executives 
asked after the speech if he still had an interest in buying 
into ual corp parent company of united airlines after a deal for 
an employeemanagement buyout of the airline fell through king 
said not in the foreseeable future 
british airways would have gained a 15 percent interest in the 
new ual 
king said however that british airways would continue to 
widen and deepen its marketing agreements with united and 
possibly make similar agreements with other us carriers 
we shall continue to pursue our ambition to be the first 
truely global airline he said 
king said the united deal which failed to get the needed 
financing was skewed by the need to restrict the level of 
foreign participation to what would be acceptable to the us 
government 
us law allows no more than 25 percent foreign interest in the 
voting stock of an american carrier 
king said that even though 27 percent of british airways is 
owned by americans it likely would not have been allowed to 
acquire more than 15 percent of a us airline 
he noted that skinner forced a reduction of klm royal dutch 
airlines interest in the takeover of northwest airlines parent 
company nwa inc 
king said he would continue to encourage his government to 
resist us carriers efforts to gain additional services to 
manchester and other british cities unless british airways is 
allowed to serve more us cities 
disparity in market strength has enabled the us to trade 
limited access to the american market for larger access to the 
european he said 
but after 1992 when 12 european markets unite conditions will 
change he said 
do not expect the nations of europe to continue to accept such 
an unequal state of affairs king said 
he said european states are expected to open all of their routes 
to all airlines within the european community and the united 
states could be part of the community 
but he added if europe is to be open to us airlines the 
united states must be opened to european airlines

the value of us agricultural exports is 
expected to decline in 1990 after reaching an eightyear peak in 
1989 the agriculture department said 
shipment value rose to 397 billion in the fiscal year that 
ended sept 30 the most since the record of 438 billion in 1981 
for 1990 the department said tuesday exports may drop to 38 
billion 
the actual quantity of shipments also is down totaling 1478 
million metric tons 1629 million short tons in the last fiscal 
year in 1990 those may drop to 1455 million metric tons 1604 
million short tons 
lower prices for most grains and oilseeds largely account for 
what is expected to be the first decrease in export value since 
fiscal 1986 the report said 
export volume will be down mostly because of a substantial 
decline in wheat exports which will be partly offset by larger 
shipments of corn soybeans cotton and highvalue products

a new magazine on science and health topics 
geared toward people over age 50 is planned for next spring from 
family media inc the publisher of such magazines as discover and 
health 
family media says the digestsized magazine will be called 
breakthroughs in health and science it plans to publish the 
magazine every other month with a circulation projected at 400000 
meanwhile the editorinchief of health dianne partie lange 
said tuesday she has resigned as a result of a series of recent 
changes affecting her magazine 
among the changes are a planned 27 percent reduction in healths 
circulation rate base cutting the frequency of publication to 10 
times a year from 12 and the appointment of two editorial directors 
to oversee family medias 11 magazines 
ms lange said she had not been consulted in advance about the 
moves 
the magazine i was recruited to produce is not the magazine 
the company wants to continue with ms lange said she had been 
editor since april 1988 
breakthroughs is being designed to appeal to older consumers 
interested in noteworthy advances in health medicine psychology 
and other sciences the company said 
gregory dunn group president of family media publications said 
tuesday that advertisers are starting to realize the potential of 
the growing group of older consumers although few have begun 
spending much to reach them 
he said the launch of breakthroughs should put family media in a 
position to benefit over the next few years as appreciation for the 
market builds 
a number of publishers have shown an interest in developing 
magazines for older readers or giving advertisers a chance to buy 
space only in issues of their magazines that go to older 
subscribers 
dunn said science digest with a circulation of 250000 would 
be folded into breakthroughs older subscribers to health would be 
encouraged to switch to breakthroughs as well 
the last issue of science digest probably will be published in 
march with breakthroughs starting in may dunn said 
health will continue to feature stories on food nutrition 
fitness medicine fashion and beauty targeting younger women he 
said 
but family media said that because health will be aimed at a 
younger readership its rate base will be cut to 800000 in 
february 1990 from 11 million 
the decision to publish health and another monthly savvy woman 
only 10 times a year brings them in line with five other family 
media magazines golf illustrated homeowner model taxi and your 
family which family media previously disclosed would be launched 
in january in doctors waiting rooms 
family media also named two editorial directors for its 
magazines 
paul hoffman 33 editor of discover will serve as editorial 
director of of 1001 home ideas health homeowner and breakthroughs 
neil amdur 49 editor of world tennis will be editorial 
director for golf illustrated savvy woman taxi model and your 
family 
ms lange said her decision to resign was the culmination of 
those and other recent decisions by family media management 
when i was recruited i was told this was to be serious 
contender in health marketplace ms lange said 
she said her editorial staff produced such a magazine but that 
family media appeared unwilling to spend enough on promotion and 
distribution 
ms lange 44 said she is exploring possibilities in the 
wake of mondays abrupt resignation she was an editorial executive 
at self magazine for nine years before taking the top editorial 
post at health

unable to buy a record company at a price 
it considers reasonable walt disney co says it will launch its 
own label tentatively titled hollywood records that will include 
rock n roll movie soundtracks and other pop formats 
the disney label will start up early next year disney said 
tuesday the company will be headed by music attorney peter 
paterno who will be joined in running the enterprise by mike bone 
the president of chrysalis records 
we are not joining the shark frenzy of media acquisitions 
michael eisner disneys chairman and chief executive officer said 
in a telephone interview we are going to try to create from the 
ground up our own properties 
the investment is not big enough that it puts the pressure on 
us to have the biggest and the best right away eisner said 
were going to go slow 
he said the move was prompted in part by the booming 
international demand for recorded music 
the recorded music business is a bigger business than the 
movie business or the themepark business or the television 
business eisner said referring to the other areas in which 
disney operates 
while declining to reveal disneys initial investment in the 
record arm eisner said the costs were infinitesimal less than 
the average 17 million cost of a motion picture 
disney already has a childrens record label walt disney 
records that it calls the largest childrens music company in the 
world the label will operate independently of the new record 
division disney said 
disney shares closed at 130 tuesday in consolidated new york 
stock exchange trading down 87 cents 
eisner said he was not concerned that the 
sometimescontroversial nature of rock n roll music could tarnish 
disneys wellhoned family image 
this is no more a disney label than disney subsidiary 
touchstone pictures is a disney picture eisner said this is 
owned by our same shareholders but this record division is 
separate and completely separated from disney and would therefore 
have no effect on anything at disney 
as an attorney paterno has represented such heavymetal artists 
as guns n roses and metallica 
if youre going to be in the record business youve got to 
have some controversy paterno said earlier this month when 
rumors of hollywood records launch circulated even the clean 
artists like madonna and george michael are very controversial 
eisner said the disney label would not follow the pattern of 
some recently launched record labels of signing topdollar acts to 
establish a presence and prove to the industry that the label means 
business 
its going to be the opposite of that eisner said our 
concept is as our concept has been in the movie business and the 
television business to find new exciting talent that becomes 
your own 
harold vogel an entertainment industry analyst with merrill 
lynch amp co in new york said the label could become a significant 
revenue center for disney over time 
they long wanted a music division and theyve looked at many 
different possibilities from the standpoint of acquisition just 
about everybody who was up for sale in the last five years vogel 
said 
but theyve apparently decided that it was too expensive to 
buy so theyve decided to build he said over the long term 
profits could be significant but clearly in the next year or two 
it wont amount to much

opecs latest production deal should help 
slow a decline in oil prices in the first half of 1990 by partially 
succeeding in reducing cheating on quotas by the cartels 13 
members analysts say 
the organization of petroleum exporting countries oil ministers 
on tuesday signed a pact under which their daily production ceiling 
will rise to 22 million barrels from 205 million barrels in the 
current quarter 
the groups 18abarrel target price becomes a minimum 
reference price 
the producers output is actually up to 235 million barrels a 
day and the new accord should bring it down to some 228 million 
barrels a day analysts say 
that means prices for north sea brent blend for example likely 
will drop to 17 a barrel instead of to 16 a barrel in the 
spring when demand for oil usually slackens analysts say 
the spot price of north sea brent blend the most widely traded 
international crude oil was 1815 a barrel wednesday morning 
down from 1830 a barrel late tuesday 
opecs price of crude oil stood at 1774 a barrel said the 
cartels secretarygeneral subroto 
we feel that if it deviates too much from the minimum 
reference price then we will meet subroto told a news 
conference 
in the meantime opecs eightmember monitoring committee plans 
to meet in march in order to assess the market the ministers 
said in a communique 
leading oil ministers were upeat about the pact 
hisham nazer saudi arabias influential oil minister told 
reporters that prices will steadily go up after the market 
ascertains the durability of the agreement there is more 
discipline now there is more commitment to the quota and the 
production ceiling 
the deal should cut production by up to 13 million barrels a 
day he said 
fergus macleod an oil analyst with the london investment firm 
barclays de zoete wedd ltd agreed it looks better than most 
people thought was possible 
the ministers came up with a partial solution to demands from 
kuwait and the united arab emirates for bigger portions of the 
production the two have been producing about double their current 
quotas 
kuwait agreed tuesday to a quota of 15 million barrels a day 
up from its previous quota of 115 million barrels a day but below 
its current output of 2 million barrels a day 
the united arab emirates officially agreed to a steady daily 
quota of 1095 million barrels 
but united arab emirates oil minister mana saeed otaiba said his 
country got behindthescenes clearance from opec to produce 2 
million barrels a day that would be less than the countrys 
current output which otaiba pegged at 26 million barrels a day 
otaiba also warned that the uaes output would surpass 2 
million barrels a day if there were excesses by other opec members 
agreement and understanding was reached with the oil ministers 
to allow the united arab emirates to produce 2 million barrels 
daily otaiba was quoted as saying by abu dhabis official news 
agency wam 
but opecs overall producion still will be well above the 
expected demand of 215 million barrels

shearson lehman hutton inc announced today a 
corporate realignment and management reshuffle that included the 
reassignment of company president jeffrey b lane to a lesser 
position 
the move reflected the continuing turmoil at the nations 
secondlargest investment firm which over the past month announced 
layoffs of hundreds of workers and a sharp reduction in stockbroker 
commissions 
peter a cohen shearsons chairman and chief executive officer 
said in a statement today that the company was dividing its 
businesses into four groups capital markets investment and 
merchant banking private client and subsidiary activities 
other big wall street firms have made similar realignments in 
recent years 
lane was reassigned to head the subsidiary activities group 
which will include shearsons money management businesses including 
its boston co division cohen said 
robert s fuld jr who currently heads shearsons taxable 
fixedincome division was seen as replacing lane as cohens 
secondincommand although fuld was not given the title of 
shearsons president 
fuld was named president of shearsons capital markets group 
which will include the companys worldwide capital markets 
activities he will also oversee shearsons administrative side

month that it was in the process of reshuffling its businesses

1 percent to 2 percent in 1990 and on nov 7 it said it had begun 
laying off employees in a cutback that could total 2 percent by the 
end of the year 
analysts have said the changes at shearson stem from american 
express desire to reduce its stake in the investment firm but 
wants shearson to first improve its profitability 
the company is also trying to stave off a possible lowering of 
its credit rating by moodys investors service 
in the third quarter shearson said it earned 66 million but

sale of its lehman management co and investment banking fees from 
the merger of time inc and warner communications inc

banking group will be headed by sherman r lewis jr and that

a federal grand jury convened today to 
investigate a thiokol corp engineers allegations of improper 
inspections of shuttle parts since the challenger disaster 
us attorney frank donaldson said he could not comment on the 
probe or any other matter the grand jury holding its regular 
session might look into he said he expects the panel to complete 
its work by friday 
steve lawson a spokesman for utahbased thiokol said tuesday 
the company was asked to provide information about instrumentation 
in the redesigned rocket motors that were used beginning with the 
discovery flight on sept 30 1988 
a quality control engineer for thiokol dan joos said tuesday 
he wrote a memo to his superiors citing improper inspection 
procedures in some equipment used on shuttle missions joos who 
has been subpoenaed to appear before the grand jury said his 
superiors forwarded the memo nasa 
he said challenger and the three subsequent shuttles may have 
operated with inaccurate equipment because of improper inspections 
he said up to 50 percent of the data measured on shuttle flights 
may be inaccurate which means we could lose another shuttle 
today 
royce mitchell manager of the solid rocket booster program at 
marshall space flight center in huntsville said the grand jury 
probe probably would be confined to the first three shuttle flights 
after the jan 28 1986 challenger explosion 
several hundred changes were made to the shuttle solid rocket 
boosters after the challenger exploded 
one of the major parts of the booster that was redesigned was 
the field joint blamed in the challenger accident 
the joints are formed when the huge booster segments are stacked 
at the kennedy space center in cape canaveral fla cold launch 
temperatures prevented orings from sealing the joints allowing 
gas to escape 
a thiokol spokesman rocky raab said tuesday night that the 
government has requested thiokol corporation to provide 
additional information relating to the redesigned solid rocket 
motors used in the space shuttle program 
the information deals with instrumentation used on the first 
three flights using the redesigned solid rocket motors 
postchallenger flights the instrumentation and the motors on 
which it was used were flown successfully and fulfilled nasas 
mission requirements 
raab said he did not know who requested the information and said 
he was not familiar with joos 
we know as little about it as you do at the moment he said 
this was all the information we were able to gather this 
afternoon

the us economy grew at a moderate annual 
rate of 27 percent from july through september the government 
reported today but analysts say growth is slowing in the current 
quarter 
the increase reported by the commerce department in the broadest 
measure of economic health was up from an advance estimate of 25 
percent issued last month 
the revision was about in line with economists expectations 
but it could still cause the federal reserve board to move more 
cautiously in its campaign to lower interest rates as a stimulant 
to growth 
most of the revision was attributed to a betterthananticipated 
trade performance the september trade deficit which hit a 
fiveyear low was unavailable when the advance estimate was made 
exports climbed at an annual rate of 16 percent in the third 
quarter compared with an earlier estimate of no change while 
imports grew only 95 percent compared with a 151 percent jump in 
last months report 
consumer spending was also better than first thought rising a 
brisk annual rate of 62 percent the strongest since the first 
quarter of 1988 compared with a preliminary estimate of 58 
percent 
inflation as measured by a price index tied to the gnp 
improved dramatically in the third quarter climbing at an annual 
rate of 29 percent after a 50 percent jump in the apriljune 
quarter those figures were unchanged from the advance estimate 
the gnp grew at an annual rate of 25 percent in the second 
quarter and for the first nine months of the year is averaging a 
30 percent annual rate just above the bush administrations 
forecast for the whole year 
at the white house presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater 
said we always like to see increase in growth and this report 
is relatively good news in that sense 
still many analysts believe the economy will have a tough time 
meeting the target because of a dramatic slowing in the current 
threemonth period a few predict the country will topple into a 
recession ending the sevenyear economic expansion that is 
unprecedented in peacetime 
it would take only a 18 percent gnp increase in the 
octoberdecember quarter to match the administration forecast 
according to a commerce department analyst but most private 
economists expect a growth rate of 15 percent or lower 
my view is we can stay out of a recession but just barely 
said economist david jones of aubrey g lanston amp co a government 
securities dealer in new york 
in a separate report today the commerce department said 
aftertax corporate profits were off a sharp 72 percent in the 
third quarter matching the decline in the second quarter which 
was the worst performance in three years the decline marks the 
third consecutive quarter that profits have dropped 
but the department attributed 11 billion of the 155 billion 
decline to losses from hurricane hugo benefits paid by insurance 
companies totaled 9 billion while uninsured corporate losses 
totaled 2 billion 
jones said corporate profits will continue to be weak with the 
economy softening companies are finding it difficult to pass on 
rising labor costs to their customers he said 
analysts generally do not expect the thirdquarter surge in 
consumer spending will be repeated attributing much of it to auto 
purchases spurred by dealer discounts and financing incentives 
they also are pessimistic about trade believing that the 
strength in the dollar will stall improvement in the deficit 
however michael boskin the presidents chief economic adviser 
said tuesday that falling interest rates should sustain economic 
growth into next year 
some private forecasters believe the economy will slow 
but even the most pessimistic forecaster does not see a serious 
downturn in the economy boskin told a conference sponsored by 
the agriculture department 
the federal reserve in june reversed its program of fighting 
inflation with rising interest rates but has lowered rates only 
gradually since then it last eased credit early this month 
nudging the rate charged among banks for overnight loans down a 
quarterpoint to 85 percent 
many analysts incorrectly reported last week that the fed had 
eased again but they still expect the move to come before the end 
of the year 
in other details from todays gnp report 
business capital spending a bright spot in previous quarters 
slowed to an annual growth rate of 46 percent compared with the 
advance estimate of 58 percent analysts say falling corporate 
profits will cause businesses to further cut back in this area 
housing construction which has been in a slump as a result of 
the feds inflationfighting campaign fell at an annual rate of 
84 percent nearly double the advance estimate of a 48 percent 
decline 
the various changes left the economy after adjusting for 
inflation growing at an annual rate of 416 trillion in the third 
quarter 277 billion higher than the secondquarter pace

dr kenneth cooper is keeping the aerobics 
movement alive with a bottomline pitch to executives good 
fitness is good business 
cooper helped start the fitness boom more than 20 years ago with 
his bestselling book aerobics and he has not let the profits 
of the boom slip through his wellexercised fingers 
cooper has developed five health centers on 30 acres in one of 
dallass most pricey neighborhoods some of the citys bestknown 
executives and celebrities pay 900 a year here to grunt growl and 
trudge their way to fitness 
the complex includes a hotel for the healthconscious exercise 
facilities a research institute and a clinic cooper aims to make 
the mayo clinic of preventive medicine 
treadmills exercise bicycles and rowing machines are found 
throughout the colonialstyle complex outside a milelong 
rubberized track winds around the landscaped grounds over 
picturesque footbridges and through groves of trees 
cooper says that many corporations foot the bill for their 
executives membership both as a perk to attract quality 
management and in the belief healthy executives are better 
executives 
president bush and former cowboys quarterback roger staubach 
have worked out at the complex still cooper said that doesnt 
mean we dont have the flight attendants and busboys 
health club members provide fodder for studies conducted at the 
coopers institute for aerobics research after each workout 
members use computer terminals to record their performances which 
become raw data for institute researchers 
the institutes research has led to more than 600 books 
monographs and articles including coopers highly publicized 
15year study released this month showing even a modest amount of 
exercise can prolong life 
it all was a great big gamble in 1970 when cooper quit as 
the air force senior flight surgeon to follow his dream of creating 
the preventive medicine center of the world 
no bank would lend him the money to get started despite the 
success of his 1968 book aerobics so cooper borrowed 12 
million from tyler corp to buy a mansion and 22 acres on dallass 
prestigious preston road since then while writing eight more 
books and signing contracts for three more cooper has pumped at 
least 11 million into construction and the purchase of an adjacent 
church to house the nonprofit research institute 
he says the institute is the reason for the rest of the 
operation other divisions are 
the cooper clinic where nine doctors practice coopers 
preaching of preventive medicine a physical complete with 
nutritional screening and a treadmill stress test takes at least 
six hours and costs 850 add cancer screening and the cost is 
1159 
the inresidence programs four seven or 13day stays where 
participants learn to be healthy in addition to a physical the 
program includes visits to restaurants and grocery stores where 
clients learn how to order and shop to avoid unhealthy food the 
cost runs from 1595 for the fourday program to 4695 for a 
13day stay in a private suite 
cooper defends the cost some of which can be borne by insurance 
companies saying other programs offer less for more money 
the guest lodge besides providing housing for the inresidence 
programs in its two buildings also is an operating hotel with the 
usual services and amenities 
there are other programs offered including training for several 
government agencies such as the internal revenue service and the 
bureau of prisons 
the budget is 12 million a year cooper said the center is 
profitable but wouldnt say how profitable 
michael evans was one of the first to sign on at the aerobics 
center which opened 19 years ago 
i came out here so i can stay fit so i can work more 
effectively said evans a 62yearold insurance executive who 
credits exercise for keeping him from triplebypass heart surgery 
and helping him stand the stress of a midcareer job change 
this place has a sense of urgency he said pointing out 
that there are no afterjogging cocktails or partying to negate the 
good done by the exercise everybodys here for their own 
wellbeing not just that country club appearance 
while cooper likes to mention how george bush ran around the 
centers track with a pack of secret service agents another 
wellknown member brought the center unwanted notoriety 
on may 1 1985 cbs television sportscaster frank glieber was 
walking around the centers track when he suffered a fatal heart 
attack 
cooper says glieber whom he described as a close friend had 
let himself go but cooper also noted joggers have logged 7 
million miles on the aerobic center tracks and gliebers death and 
two nonfatal cardiac events were the only emergencies 
the death of another jogging guru jim fixx in 1984 plus 
gliebers attack led cooper to write running without fear 
there is no panacea he says we have to keep this thing 
in perspective

the makers of combat and raid have locked 
antennae over the lucrative cockroachkilling market trading 
charges in advertising and federal court 
raid maker sc johnson amp co has been in the business longer 
giving it an advantage over the larger american cyanamid co which 
introduced its combat line only in 1985 
even so american cyanamid is posing a serious threat to sc 
johnson or johnson wax as the privately owned racine wisbased 
company is usually known 
cyanamid fired a doublebarreled blast in us district court 
accusing johnson wax in separate lawsuits of false advertising and 
trademark infringement 
johnson wax countersued charging that cyanamids advertising 
made its own false claims both are asking for corrective 
television commercials and damages 
while the legal battles go on cyanamids combat has garnered 
more than 12 percent of the halfbilliondollar home insecticide 
market making it second to johnsons raid which has about 47 
percent according to industry estimates 
johnson wax seems to be the one thats scrambling to do 
whatever it can to defend its marketshare position said harvey 
stober a dean witter reynolds inc analyst 
stober said johnson waxs zeal may be leading it to excesses in 
advertising and packaging everyone he said wants to be the 
bigger roach killer 
the court cases are pending before us district judge john 
bissell the judge dealt wayne njbased cyanamid a preliminary 
blow in august another hearing is set for january 
the story begins april 26 when johnson wax unveiled its raid 
max line in a media splash at the chicago academy of sciences 
johnson wax has said it would spend 100 million to advertise the 
line its first since raid hit the market in 1956 the line 
includes an aerosol spray killer fogger and bait trap combat has 
the same lineup 
two days after the introduction cyanamid launched its first 
suit accusing johnson wax of violating a cyanamid trademark for 
its maxforce line directed at exterminators and not home users 
in court papers the company said maxforce products this year 
would bring in 3 million advertising cost 1 million 
cyanamids claim that raid max is likely to be confused with 
maxforce is in my judgment something no competent marketing 
person would say to his peers and expect to be believed said 
raids product manager ravichandra k saligram in an affidavit 
to a point bissell agreed in an opinion filed aug 30 he 
refused to issue a temporary ban on the use of max saying 
there was no compelling need for such an order in advance of a 
fuller hearing 
but even as lawyers were arguing the question on aug 28 before 
bissell cyanamid came to court with another suit 
johnson wax advertisements aired last spring falsely claimed 
that raid fumigators bombs that release a cloud of smoke lethal 
to cockroaches killed combat survivors sought out roaches while 
combat was passive went everywhere outkilled combat and 
worked three hours after use cyanamid charged 
actually combats maker said combat leaves no survivors and 
kills remote roaches when they cannibalize infected victims 
moreover it said the fumigators dont live up to the claims 
combat ads meanwhile had been running in august and now it 
was johnson waxs turn 
in its own filing the wisconsin company said the combat 
commercials falsely claimed the fumigators odor could be smelled 
in fact the user smells only the pleasant scent of aromatic 
ingredients in the product said the papers 
cyanamid also falsely claimed roaches dont come back to a home 
treated by combat and that combat was more powerful than a 
fumigator johnson wax said 
cyanamid last month sent out a wave of attorneys to question 
johnson waxs ad people researchers and testers 
bissell will hold a hearing in january on the dispute said 
cyanamid attorney donald robinson

along with the holiday festivities it brings 
december poses some of the toughest challenges of all in the battle 
to manage your money 
the rush of giftbuying partygiving and holiday travel can 
easily bust a budget that has been judiciously managed through the 
other 11 months of the year 
experts on the subject have no single magic formula to offer 
that will see you through the holidays with your finances 
unscathed friendships family or business circumstances may 
dictate that you must spend more money at this time of year than 
you otherwise would 
but financial advisers do suggest that your chances of staying 
solvent will improve drastically if you have an organized plan 
its wise to set up a budget before starting to shop 
counsels the american bankers association 
in addition to funds set aside for gifts consumers should 
allow for extra expenses unique to the holiday season such as food 
for parties and out of town guests cards and postage wrapping 
paper and decorations 
adds the newsletter 100 highest yields in north palm beach 
fla put the same number crunching to a trip to visit the 
grandparents or escape the cold weather 
what you dont want to do is run up a huge tab on your cards 
or draw down your savings the mastercard or visa bill will hang 
over your head for months even worse you may need cash for an 
emergency and not have it 
the season can be especially treacherous for anyone walking 
around with a wallet full of credit cards 
buying with a credit card is an added convenience during the 
busy holidays especially with long lines and harried salespeople 
to contend with the aba says 
however consumers should keep a wary eye on impulse buying by 
setting a limit on how much they intend to charge on their cards 
and sticking to it 
if you are among the approximately twothirds of all bankcard 
holders who dont pay off the full balance due each month there is 
an added incentive this year to keep a rein on credit purchases 
credit card interest which always has been expensive will get 
more so jan 1 under a change mandated by the tax reform act of 
1986 in 1989 20 percent of personal interest is still 
taxdeductible next year the percentage drops to 10 percent 
before going to zero in 1991 
for consumers who dont ordinarily work with a defined 
budget the aba says a general guideline is that credit 
obligations including credit cards car payments and student or 
personal loans should not exceed 10 to 15 percent of takehome 
pay 
these credit expenses plus mortgage or rent payments should 
not exceed 35 to 40 percent of gross income 
adroit holiday moneymanagement can have multiple rewards in 
the waning days of the year money that isnt spent shopping can be 
used for charitable contributions mortgage payments state and 
local taxes or any number of other things that might qualify as 
deductions on your 1989 tax return 
such planning may not do much to make your holiday merrier but 
it can be considered an investment toward a happy new year

braniff inc is struggling along with 275 
employees as a small charter carrier the airlines top executives 
say but a favorable court ruling on aircraft purchases and leases 
may help it get some needed cash 
the future remains cloudy for the airline braniff officials 
told a group of disgruntled creditors tuesday orlandobased 
braniff filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on sept 28 its 
second such filing in seven years and cancelled all its regularly 
scheduled flights earlier this month 
howard mckinnon braniffs chief operating officer said the 
company has a number of alternate plans but lack of financing 
prevents us from having any meaningful discussion or planning 
he and chairman bill mcgee are still trying to interest 
investors or buyers in braniff 
meanwhile a bankruptcy judges ruling this past weekend will 
work in favor of braniff allowing it to add to its physical assets 
its aircraft fleet with longterm lease and purchase agreements 
for 50 airbus a320 jets said company lawyer howard t glassman 
us bankruptcy judge c timothy corcoran ruled last saturday 
that braniffs contracts for the 50 airplanes with a number of 
aviation companies are valid despite the bankruptcy proceedings 
in addition braniff has an option to buy another 50 airbuses 
braniff considers those contracts the linchpin to enable the 
debtor to go forward glassman said meaning that the airline can 
sublease the planes or sell the contracts the agreements also make 
braniff more attractive to potential buyers 
however the carrier failed to come up with 3 million in lease 
payments for five airbuses it has already received from gpa group 
ltd and may have to return the jets 
gpa an irish leasing company is expected to sue braniff to get 
the five planes returned glassman said however that braniff may 
appeal the ruling hoping to extend the payment deadline by 60 days 
but thats a totally separate issue he told reporters if 
i lost the planes on the ground because we couldnt pay the 3 
million that doesnt impact the other 95 planes the five are not

the stock market fell in generally lackluster

profits after the markets recent gains the dow jones industrial 
average has gained nearly 70 points in the last five trading

market after the federal reserve both added and drained reserves 
from the banking system in recent days 
many assumed the feds action last week pointed to an easing of 
interest rates but the central bank confused the market with this 
weeks draining move that sent shortterm interest rates higher 
bank stocks came under pressure today after southwest bank of 
st louis announced it was raising its prime rate back to 105 
percent from 10 percent after cutting it three weeks ago 
some analysts said however that the markets sluggishness was 
merely a pause after the recent runup in stock prices and before 
the start of a prechristmas rally 
its two days overdue said ralph bloch chief market 
analyst with raymond james amp associates in st petersburg fla 
bloch said the recent stock gains were reminiscent of the 
october market when a handful of bluechip issues led the market 
higher before prices plunged on october 13

chrysler corp executives on wednesday 
defended the planned closing of a detroit car assembly plant a 
move united auto workers union leaders say could worsen labor 
relations with the nations no 3 automaker 
the executives and uaw leaders met during their annual weeklong 
gathering for exploring ways to ease tensions 
much of the discussion wednesday centered on the planned feb 2 
closing of the jefferson avenue assembly plant in detroit where 
dodge omni and plymouth horizon subcompact cars are made 
union members contend the closing which will result in layoffs 
of about 1700 workers violates local and national contracts 
chrysler maintains the closing is permitted because of slumping 
sales of the omni and horizon 
chrysler is building a new assembly plant next to the jefferson 
avenue factory and it will employ many of the people now making 
omni and horizon cars but training for those workers wont begin 
until fall 1991 
were a little upset at being the last person to know of the 
closing of the jefferson plant said robert bowling president of 
uaw local 110 in st louis the press knew before we did and we 
dont think thats right 
uaw president owen bieber said it pretty well this morning 
he told them that he didnt appreciate it 
the company announced on nov 3 shortly after a story about the 
closing appeared in the wall street journal that it was halting 
production at the jefferson avenue factory and trimming production 
at its car plant in st louis 
anthony st john chryslers vice president for labor relations 
said the first 2 days of the meeting were constructive as union 
and company officials talked about joint training programs 
today there was some initial tension because there was some 
concern over the way the jefferson situation had been handled he 
said wednesday there was a lot of frustration there from an 
employees standpoint 
st john also said chrysler vice chairman gerald greenwald told 
union members that the jefferson avenue plant had fallen victim to 
slow cars sales 
basically oneshift production is 470 units a day and daily 
sales orders were averaging about 220 indicating that we were 
losing money on each vehicle st john said 
bowling said greenwald told the union leaders that chrysler 
would try to better handle announcements such as the jefferson 
avenue plant closing bowling said he would be satisfied if the 
company kept its commitments 
upperlevel chrysler and uaw officials have been gathering for 
similar annual meetings since 1986 and chrysler chairman lee 
iacocca has spoken at the previous ones 
iacocca skipped this years opportunity to address union 
representatives saying there was a longstanding previous 
commitment 
the meeting began eight days after hundreds of angry uaw members 
paraded outside chrysler headquarters in the detroit enclave of 
highland park protesting the planned jefferson avenue closing 
contract talks between the union and the nations big three 
automakers general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler 
begin next summer union contracts with the companies expire at 
midnight sept 14 1990

gold prices fell sharply wednesday on new yorks commodity 
exchange steepening a slide that represents either a temporary 
setback in a bull market or golds retreat from its highest point 
in nearly a year 
i think the verdict is still out on that one said john 
jonat a trader with deak international inc a new yorkbased 
dealer of precious metals and foreign currencies 
on other futures markets wednesday porkbelly futures fell the 
limit for the second straight day energy futures advanced and 
grains and soybeans were mixed 
gold futures settled 390 to 4 lower on the comex with the 
contract for delivery in december down 4 at 40950 a troy ounce 
silver fell 95 cents to 97 cents with december settling at 560 
a troy ounce 
the december gold contract has dropped more than 10 since 
friday when it peaked at 41970 the highest comex gold price 
since middecember 
jonat said he was surprised gold fell so sharply after tuesdays 
very slight loss which he had taken as a sign that a wave of 
profittaking had passed 
nevertheless he said im reluctant to say the path is going 
to be down 
analyst don tierney of stanley bell amp co a new yorkbased 
futures brokerage blamed the decline on selling ahead of the first 
notice day for the december gold contract 
under comex rules thursday is the first day for traders to 
declare their intention to deliver gold against the december 
contract a relatively large number of delivery notices are 
expected and traders on the buy side of december contracts 
must sell contracts to avoid taking physical delivery 
the market has been in a little bit of a nervous condition 
ahead of this delivery position tierney said after the 
pressure is out of the way from the first day of deliveries the 
market will then resume its trend 
porkbelly futures prices slammed down the 2centsapound daily 
limit for the second straight day on the chicago mercantile 
exchange after the government announced it had accepted bids for 
920000 pounds of pork bellies to be shipped to poland as part of a 
food aid package 
the announcement follows last weeks announcement of a 
280000pound government purchase bringing to 12 million pounds 
the amount of bellies the government has bought to ship to poland 
the markets reaction reflected disappointment that the 
government is not moving more quickly toward obtaining the total of 
22 million pounds that it is expected to buy 
at this pace it would take forever to fill up a cargo to send 
over there said charles levitt senior livestock analyst with 
shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago 
live cattle futures settled 07 cent to 72 cent lower with 
december at 7522 cents a pound feeder cattle were 32 cent lower 
to 17 cent higher with november at 8372 cents a pound live hogs 
were 15 cent to 63 cent lower with december at 5052 cents a 
pound frozen pork bellies were 198 cents to 2 cents lower with 
february at 6055 cents a pound 
energy futures rose moderately on the new york mercantile 
exchange reflecting sentiments that the market had overreacted 
tuesday to opecs decision to raise its crudeoil output on jan 1 
to 22 million barrels per day from 205 million 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 7 cents to 15 cents 
higher with january at 1940 a barrel heating oil was 30 cent to 
59 cent higher with december at 6061 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 19 cent to 35 cent higher with december at 4972 
cents a gallon 
grain and soybean futures prices finished mixed on the chicago 
board of trade in a lackluster session 
wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with 
december at 405 a bushel corn was cent to 2 cents higher 
with december at 234 a bushel oats were cent to 1 cent lower

most deeply discounted advancepurchase fares by 10 to 20 round 
trip starting dec 16 the maxsavers would be increased by 10 on 
flights of less than 1000 miles and 20 on longer trips 
i would think the other airlines would follow pan am because 
were seeing costs increase pretty sharply said edward j

a plan to sell farmers group inc the nations 
thirdlargest auto insurer as part of a hostile takeover bid for 
parent bat industries is questionable and should be rejected 
attorneys for farmers told state insurance regulators wednesday 
but sir james goldsmith the anglofrench financier whose 
hoylake investment ltd is mounting the bid dismissed the argument 
as a desperate tactic in bat managements noholdsbarred 
takeover defense 
the illinois department of insurance hearings that began 
wednesday are to determine the suitability of hoylake to become 
farmers parent through the proposed acquisition of bat the 
londonbased tobacco retailing paper and financial services 
concern 
goldsmiths 211 billion bat takeover plan was suspended 
earlier this year to allow hoylake to seek approval from us state 
insurance commissioners to change farmers ownership 
hoylake has vowed to sell off all of bats nontobacco holdings 
under the buyout plan farmers would be sold to french insurer axa 
midi assurance for 45 billion 
los angelesbased farmers operates in illinois and eight other 
states illinois is the first to begin review of the takeover bid 
to determine if it is in the best interest of insurance 
policyholders 
goldsmith has attempted unsuccessfully to block the reviews 
arguing that state regulators have no constitutional right to pass 
judgment on a foreign buyout 
during wednesdays hearing attorneys for hoylake argued that 
the question of the companys suitability to own or operate an 
insurance carrier is irrelevant because if the bat takeover is 
successful hoylake plans to simultaneously sell farmers to axa 
midi 
hoylakes consistent position is and has been that it has no 
wish to own and operate an insurance company in the united states 
and farmers in particular hoylake attorney robert l king said 
in opening statements before seymour simon the former state 
supreme court justice serving as hearing officer 
hoylake has entered into irrevocable contracts ensuring that 
axa midi will own and control farmers king said 
hoylake does not seek approval to own and operate farmers 
he said but rather authority to act purely as a conduit in the 
sale of the company to axa midi 
but farmers attorney doug broadwater questioned whether an 
immediate sale was a certainty 
hoylake had already offered state insurance regulators three 
possible plans for the sale only to change them later 
every time hoylake comes up with yet another possible scheme 
this department is assured that nothing could go wrong 
broadwater said calling the takeover plan legally bizarre 
he also said hoylakes financial position is precarious and that 
it lacks the qualifications to run an insurance business 
it is an offshore company engaged in no business other than to 
acquire bat broadwater said 
goldsmith said in a statement that farmers argument was an 
attempt to divert attention away from the merits of acquisition of 
the company by axa midi 
the suggestion that there is any danger of midi not completing 
the acquisition of farmers is ludicrous he said 
a hearing on the takeover plan before california regulators is 
scheduled for january those in arizona idaho oregon and 
washington are expected later next year a goldsmith spokesman said 
hearings in kansas ohio and texas havent been scheduled he 
said

a group of eastern airlines machinist union leaders 
and striking workers could face federal civil contempt charges 
stemming from an altercation between pickets and working employees 
according to an order issued wednesday 
a modification to a fourmonthold temporary restraining order 
calls for the 13 defendants to appear dec 12 in us bankruptcy 
court in new york for a hearing on sundays disturbance in atlanta 
seven strikers were arrested on charges of unlawful assembly 
when they refused to leave hartsfield atlanta international airport 
after a group of pickets pelted cars with rocks and injured a 
working eastern employee 
on monday atlanta aviation commisioner calvin o carter ordered 
the strikers to dismantle a tent city erected on airport grounds 
shortly after the machinists went on strike march 4 the strikers 
have established a new compound near the airport 
the showcause order issued by us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland cites willful defiance of a july 17 temporary 
restraining order prohibiting the atlanta pickets from threatening 
or injuring eastern workers 
lifland is overseeing the chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
of the miamibased airline which filed for protection five days 
after the strike began 
machinist union leaders meanwhile huddled in washington to 
assess the impact the defections of pilots and flight attendants 
would have on their strike and pledged to continue their walkout 
however long it takes 
machinists union president george kourpias said the union would 
try to pressure texas air corp easterns parent and the 
bankruptcy court overseeing the cashstrapped carrier into a 
settlement 
the plans include demanding that lifland remove himself from the 
case kourpias and other machinists leaders have accused lifland of 
bias in favor of texas air 
the machinists cited in the order could face fines and court 
costs if found in contempt said eastern spokesman robin matell 
they include charles bryan head of the eastern machinists and 
robert taylor and charles pecca machinist officials based in 
atlanta 
liflands order also requires that a special union telephone 
message in atlanta carry a statement from local 1690 general 
chairman bob taylor condemning the sunday incident and saying the 
union does not condone these acts or are they part of the 
strike strategy 
anthony chapman vice president of the atlanta machinists 
local said wednesday he had not received the filing and declined 
to comment 
defendants are expected to receive the order no later than 
friday 
matell noted that the temporary restraining order and the 
showcause order only affect atlanta 
in miami meanwhile talks opened wednesday between eastern and 
its flight attendants union which joined pilots last week in 
ending an 8monthold sympathy strike 
matell said the twohour meeting produced no agreements and the 
flight attendants are scheduled to make a contract proposal monday 
sandra mickley a spokeswoman for the transport workers union 
declined to give details of the contract offer the twu represents 
flight attendants at eastern 
she said topics raised at wednesdays meeting included the 
company policy for rehiring workers and the unions suit against 
the airline seeking back union dues 
eastern currently has about 3400 flight attendants the union 
represented about 6000 workers at the beginning of the strike but 
it is unknown how many remain said ms mickley 
national mediation board representative sam cognata held the 
first negotiating session tuesday between the air lines pilots 
association and eastern management which began rebuilding without 
its unions following the walkout 
the airline has asked us district court in miami to clarify 
the rights of employees and those of strikers who wish to return to 
work matell said no hearing date had been set on that request

a federal mediator was called wednesday into 
contract talks between the boeing co and its engineers while the 
machinists union that ended a strike only 10 days ago filed a 
grievance against the aerospace giant 
negotiators for the secondlargest union at boeing the seattle 
professional engineering employees association contacted a federal 
mediator after receiving a disappointing money offer from 
boeing on monday union general counsel dan mahoney said wednesday 
their view of an acceptable offer doesnt harmonize with 
speeas view mahoney said this is always the way it is you 
never flatout accept what they lay on the table to expedite 
whatever movement there might be we thought it was wise to get the 
mediator in there to talk to both parties 
mediator ben youtsey started moving between company and union 
negotiating teams wednesday morning 
noneconomic and some economic issues had been resolved but a 
number of money disagreements remained including the entire wage 
offer mahoney said he declined to elaborate 
boeing spokesman paul binder also refused to discuss details of 
the offer wednesday 
at this point in negotiations its not uncommon for a mediator 
to come in to assist in reaching a final agreement binder said 
speea executive director and chief negotiator walt baer said 
wednesday he hoped to conclude talks within the next few days and 
mail an offer to members 
speea has two contracts under negotiation covering a total of 
about 27800 workers the contracts expire friday but have been 
extended until new contracts are reached 
machinists who comprise the largest union at boeing used 
federal mediator doug hammond for much of their talks with boeing 
negotiators and hammond proposed the compromise package finally 
accepted by both sides bringing the 48day strike to an end on 
nov 20 
the machinists contract affects some 57800 boeing workers 
but the machinists union district lodge 751 of the 
international association of machinists and aerospace workers 
filed a grievance with boeing wednesday complaining the company 
violated strike settlement and collective bargaining agreements by 
reassigning 838 employees to lowerranked and lowerpaying posts as 
they returned to work because of the strike 
the union asks that each employee be returned to the work 
location shift labor grade and job classification that he or she 
held on the day of work prior to the strike and that all employees 
be compensated for any loss of benefits and wages 
binder acknowledged receipt of the grievance but said boeing 
maintains no employees received any reduction in pay or 
anything 
he declined to discuss the issue further 
the 27800 engineers scientists and technical aides covered 
under speea contracts at boeing have never gone out on strike 
ninetyfive percent of them work in the seattle area 
speea and boeing negotiators have been meeting every week day 
sinc nov 2 plus last weekend 
speea had asked for a salary adjustment of 35 percent over three 
years including 14 percent in the first six months but mahoney 
said the union had made some reductions since presenting its first 
proposal 
pay for boeing engineers and scientists averages about 39000 
annually while technical aides earn an average of 29000 
the machinists won annual wage increases of 4 percent 3 percent 
and 3 percent plus bonuses of 10 percent 5 percent and 4 percent 
and a costofliving adjustment equal to almost 100 percent of 
inflation

combustion engineering inc said 
wednesday it has entered a joint venture with the soviet union and 
a finnish company to build a 2 billion petrochemical complex in 
western siberia 
the complex in the town of tobolsk will produce petrochemicals 
such as propylene and polypropylene using western siberias rich 
supply of natural resources the industrial services company said 
the petrochemicals are to be used in consumer goods as well as 
products for the automotive and medical markets 
the first three plants in the complex in tobolsk located 1100 
miles east of moscow are expected to be finished in 1993 
combustion engineering spokeswoman karen amour said 
a second phase would add more plants that would produce 
different chemicals while the third phase calls for another 
complex in the soviet town of surgut 270 miles northeast of 
tobolsk 
the joint venture is between tobolsk petrochemical formed by 
the soviet department of chemicals and oil refineries and a 
consortium of western companies led by combustion engineering and 
neste corp of finland a petrochemical company 
combustion engineering is to manage the project and handle 
foreign currency financing neste is to market the products 
worldwide 
armour said combustion engineering and neste have agreed to put 
up a total of 15 percent of the seed capital with the soviets 
contributing the rest 
she said most of the projects 2 billion cost will be raised 
through debt financing several banks are providing the credit 
including the first bank of chicago credit lyonnais of france and 
a finnish bank 
plans for the second complex would be developed during the 
second construction phase in tobolsk amour said

federal authorities probing trading abuses at the 
citys commodity exchange reportedly have expanded the 
investigation to include stockindex futures trading at the chicago 
mercantile exchange 
separately the merc said it had expelled and fined 100000 a 
trader who previously pleaded guilty to federal charges 
six traders from the mercs standard amp poors 500 index futures 
pit received subpoenas earlier this week to testify before a 
federal grand jury regarding trades they made during the 1987 
stockmarket crash the wall street journal reported in wednesdays 
editions 
the chicago suntimes said at least seven sampp 500 traders had 
received subpoenas and two more were expected to be called before 
the grand jury 
the newspapers both citing unidentified sources said the 
subpoenas represented a widening of an investigation that so far 
has resulted in the indictments of 47 traders and one clerk at the 
merc and the chicago board of trade 
us attorney anton valukas declined comment on the reports 
andrew yemma a chicago mercantile exchange spokesman said he 
could not confirm the reports 
weve always been aware that it is a continuing 
investigation yemma said 
until this week the investigation had been confined to traders 
in the mercs japanese yen and swiss franc trading pits and in the 
chicago board of trades soybean and us treasury bond pits 
in those cases fbi agents worked undercover as traders for more 
than two years to gather evidence of alleged cheating of customers 
by brokers while executing their orders in the pits 
in contrast the new twist in the investigation reportedly 
targets traders who already have been disciplined by the merc for 
alleged trading abuses during the october 1987 stock market crash 
stockindex futures are contracts to buy or sell baskets of 
stocks such as those represented by the sampp 500 index for a 
specified price on a future date index futures are used variously 
for hedging against losses in the stock market and for speculating 
on the markets movements 
the mercs sampp 500 pit is the worlds largest and most active 
stockindex futures market 
stockindex futures are frequently used in computerized program 
strategies that some experts believe contributed to the oct 19 
1987 stock market crash and the market decline of last oct 13 
in one such strategy known as index arbitrage traders move huge 
amounts of stock rapidly in attempts to profit from brief 
discrepancies between prices of stocks and the index futures other 
program trading strategies also have been blamed for contributing 
to the severity of the markets downturns 
however the futures industry contends the index futures markets 
provided a relief valve for selling during those steep market drops 
and prevented the stock market from falling even further 
in a statement the merc said it had expelled brian sledz one 
of the 21 traders of japanese yen futures indicted on aug 2 and 
fined him 100000 for making prearranged trades with his brother 
james in april 1987 
the merc said brian sledz participated in an ongoing pattern 
of illegal transactions in which brokers deliberately converted 
customer funds and market opportunities to their own use and the 
use of others 
the sledz brothers were among the first of the traders indicted 
last august to reach plea agreements with federal prosecutors 
brian sledz has pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and one 
count of violating the commodities exchange act james sledz has 
pleaded guilty to one count of mail fraud and one count of 
violating the commodities exchange act 
the merc said the offenses for which it expelled brian sledz 
were the same as the federal offenses to which he has pleaded 
guilty

the interior department said wednesday it will 
renew controversial longterm water contracts in central 
california assuring farmers will get the current volume of 
irrigation water well into the next century 
at the same time interior secretary manuel lujan directed a 
formal environmental review of how the massive diversion of federal 
water for irrigation affects the environment 
but officials acknowleged the review will not hold up contract 
renewals nor affect the duration of the new water leases or the 
amount of water supplied 
lujan did say the price of the water will more than quadruple 
and price and other terms could be affected by the review 
lujan said the leases would commit the government to supplying 
current levels of water 15 million acrefeet or 489 billion 
gallons per year to scores of local irrigation districts in the 
san joaquin river basin over the next 40 years an acrefoot or 
326000 gallons is about what a family of five uses at home in a 
year 
the renewal of the california water contracts one of the 
thorniest water issues in the west has developed into a major 
environmental test for the bush administration 
the administration has been split on the issue with the 
environmental protection agency and the presidents council on 
environmental quality supported by environmental groups arguing 
that formal environmental reviews should be conducted before the 
government commits itself to renewal 
one lease to the orange cove irrigation district came due last 
april and was renewed amid strong criticism from environmentalists 
several of the leases are expected to be up for renewal within 
weeks 
the interior department said the contracts when renewed would be 
subject to adjustments based on the findings in the 
environmental review these adjustments could included changes in 
water price requirements for increased conservation and manner of 
delivery 
but interior spokesman steve goldstein said the 40year lease 
duration and the quantity of water 15 million acrefeet a year 
would not be subject to change 
under the plan announced wednesday a formal study would be 
initiated to determine the effect of the water diversion on 
wildlife water quality and natural resources in additon the 
departments fish and wildlife service will study the effect on 
endangered species 
at a news conference in fresno calif rep charles pashayan 
rcalif whose district is in the san joaquin valley called the 
decision a profound victory for farmers 
but rep george miller dcalif chairman of the water power 
and offshore energy resources subcommittee of the house interior 
committee said lujans decision to renew the leases without 
waiting for completion of the environmental studies amounted to a 
case study in duplicity 
what value is an environmental study of the impact of water 
diversion if the amount of water divered is nonnegotiable said 
miller 
the natural resources defense council a longtime opponent of 
the governments policy of selling water to some california farmers 
for 8 an acrefoot when it costs eight to 10 times that much said 
in san francisco it was pleased the department had decided to 
require an environmental impact statement 
but we take strong exception to interiors decision not to 
review the most important terms of the new contracts in its eis 
namely the quantity of water to be diverted from the san joaquin 
river for agricultural purposes consultant karen garrison said 
she added that the group will continue to pursue an eis on all 
the terms 
in a lawsuit against the department filed by environmental 
groups a federal judge in sacramento calif has said any 
contract renewals would be subject to provisons of his eventual 
ruling 
the longterm irrigation leases are expiring at a time when 
california is struggling to develop new water distribution and 
water quality protection plans disputes over water for decades 
have pitted northern californians against those in the southern 
part of the state and citydwellers against farmers 
critics also argue that the large water diversions at belowcost 
prices have kept farmers from conserving water when growing urban 
centers willing to pay high prices for water are having trouble 
arranging future supplies
