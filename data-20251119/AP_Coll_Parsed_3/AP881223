the rev jesse jackson eulogized former abc 
news anchorman max robinson on friday as a man who wouldnt 
adjust wouldnt knuckle under the face of racism 
jackson a close friend of robinsons delivered the eulogy at a 
washington church where friends and coworkers of the nations first 
black network television anchor paid their last respects to robinson 
the former anchor said jackson wouldnt adjust wouldnt 
knuckle under the face of obvious and not so obvious racism 
robinson had been ill for more than a year when he died tuesday 
at howard university hospital of complications resulting from aids 
he was 49 
max robinson never adjusted jackson said he sought to 
transform he was not a tv thermometer who measured things and 
spilled them back out he tried to be a thermostat to change the 
temperature 
jackson told reporters that he talked to robinson about how 
robinson contracted aids and that robinson told him it is not 
homosexuality but it was promiscuity let my predicament be a 
source of education to our people 
among those attending the ceremony were abc news president roone 
arledge abc anchorman peter jennings cbs anchorman dan rather 60 
minutes reporter ed bradley and cnn anchorman bernard shaw 
i think abc news is a better place today than it was before max 
was there said arledge a lot of that is due to his efforts 
robinson began his broadcasting career as a radio station disc 
jockey in his hometown of richmond va he moved to washington in 
1965 and three years later became the first black to anchor 
newscasts at a major tv station appearing on the 6 pm and 11 pm 
news on channel 9 wtop now wusa with coanchor gordon peterson 
robinson then left washington after 10 years at the top of the 
ratings to join abc as the first black to anchor a network news 
show he was one of three anchors at abc along with jennings and 
frank reynolds 
he did an enormous amount for us said jennings he did an 
enormous amount i think for his community when max died we 
all hoped hed find some peace 
the frustrated robinson made headlines publicly denouncing racism 
at the news organization during a speech at smith college in 
february 1981 
arledge was supervising news coverage when robinson was an 
anchor and he changed abc news threeanchor format after reynolds 
died in 1983 at that point jennings inherited the job as sole 
anchor of the newscasts and robinson was assigned to do news briefs 
and weekend anchor 
in 1984 he left abc news in washington and joined wmaqtv in 
chicago the following june he entered a hospital specializing in 
alcohol rehabilitation suffering from emotional and physical 
exhaustion according to nick aronson director of communications at 
wmaqtv aronson said robinson never returned to the station and 
did sporadic freelance work after that 
i think one of my basic flaws has been the lack of esteem not 
really feeling great about myself always feeling like i had to do 
more robinson said in a washington post profile 
he is survived by his mother doris robinson griffin and 
stepfather the rev james griffin both from norfolk va and four 
children mark maureen michael and malik robinson 
robinson also leaves three surviving siblings jewel r shepperd 
jean robinson yancey and civil rights activist randall robinson the 
head of transafrica all live in washington 
there will be no private funeral as robinsons family has 
decided to have his remains cremated

a man linked to a usbased chinese dissident 
group has been arrested and an organization he led has been 
suppressed according to two official newspapers 
the reports said lei yuanhai and five members of his group 
received funds from the new yorkbased chinese alliance for 
democracy 
the group established in 1983 by a former chinese citizen 
advocates democracy in china 
china news and the peoples daily reported thursday that lei and 
his colleagues had been accused of passing out copies of china 
spring the alliances magazine that is banned in china in 
addition they allegedly attacked the dictatorship of the people 
and the socialist system and actively plotted riotous illegal 
activities 
the reports which cited no specific instances of illegal 
activities said lei founded the chongqing branch of the chinese 
alliance for democracy two years ago 
following its founding the branch received regular payments from 
new york and agents came to chongqing to help with organizing the 
reports said 
china news and the peoples daily said lei and the five others 
have admitted their involvement in the group and expressed 
repentance a letter of apology written by lei has been published 
in the chongqing daily 
the reports said the public security bureau had taken note of 
leis apology and would deal leniently with lei and the five others 
china tolerates little political dissent political reform here 
is viewed by the state as a necessary evil that will help spwr 
economic growth any moves that would challenge the supremacy of the 
chinese communist party are checked 
the press remains tightly controlled and tough censorship laws 
limit access to new political ideas 
the chinese alliance for democracy based in queens new york is 
run by wang bingzhang now a us citizen wang came to canada in 
the late 1970s from china to study at mcgill university in montreal 
in 1983 he became an american citizen and the alliance was founded 
wang has said the alliance receives money from taiwan and from 
other chinese groups interested in democracy in china his 
organization he says is committed to bringing about a democratic 
revolution in china 
wangs group and magazine china spring are relatively 
popular among the 27000 chinese students now studying in the united 
states the magazine regularly runs articles written by people it 
says are sources in china 
the magazine takes its name from beijing spring a period of 
time from 197980 when china experienced relative cultural and 
political freedoms 
the magazine lists as honorary coeditors wei jingsheng liu 
qing and xu wenli three imprisoned dissidents who were active 
during the beijing spring period 
however there is no known connection between the dissidents and 
wangs group

the couple had left the kal flight which was bound from baghdad to 
bangkok in abu dhabi one stop before it disappeared the man

four americans are killed when a bomb under a seat explodes on 
trans world airlines flight 840 from rome to athens nine other 
passengers are injured

bomb blew a gaping hole in the fuselage two women a mother and 
daughter and the daughters baby were killed when they were sucked 
from the plane and plummeted to the ground the fourth victim also 
found on the ground was killed instantly when the bomb exploded 
under his seat 
authorities speculated that the terrorist who set the charge may 
have been confused by italys recent shift to daylightsaving time 
had the bomb gone off an hour earlier before the jet began its 
descent the massive decompression of the fuselage would have 
caused a crash killing all 122 people aboard 
police said the explosive device was left under the seat by a 
woman carrying a lebanese passport under the name mei mansour who 
sat in the seat earlier when the plane was westbound mansour later

the catastrophic earthquake in armenia has 
dampened the christmas spirit in americas armenian community with 
many festivities canceled and money normally spent on gifts being 
sent for relief efforts 
armenians in the united states as well as in south america and 
europe have canceled or postponed christmas and new years parties 
weddings dances tree decorating and other activities to mourn the 
thousands killed in the dec 7 quake 
the earthquake has pretty much ruined christmas for most of the 
armenians i know said jeanmarie atamian a new york lawyer who 
had volunteered to answer phones for the armenian general benevolent 
union in saddle brook nj 
we have canceled all of the gatherings and dances and social 
functions we felt it would be totally inappropriate 
the earthquake devastated the cities of leninakan spitak and 
kirovakan and up to 100 rural settlements in northwest armenia 
official soviet sources have put the death toll as high as 55000 
and estimated the number of homeless at over 500000 
christmas is celebrated jan 6 by the armenian church and dec 25 
by armenian catholics and protestants 
leaders of the two branches of the armenian church in the united 
states declared a 40day period of mourning when the earthquake hit 
but many armenians say the decision to mute celebrations was 
spontaneous 
in new york archbishop torkom manoogian head of the eastern 
diocese of the armenian church of america will hold a requiem mass 
for children jan 7 instead of the christmas party he usually holds 
for youngsters according to adrienne alexanian a volunteer at st 
vartan armenian cathedral about 70000 armenians live in the new 
yorknew jersey area 
in california with the largest armenian population outside the 
soviet union some 250000 live in the los angeles area armenians 
have canceled weddings and holiday parties churches are holding 
special requiem services after sunday masses 
armenian protestants are preparing for a somber holiday of 
course we will still observe christs birth said rosey maranjian 
who answered the telephone for the armenian mission association at 
its headquarters in paramus nj but there is nothing to 
celebrate even though christ is born 
we keep asking why us she said one of her cousins died 
in leninakan she added 
its a sad way to celebrate such a joyous event said the 
rev moses janbazian the associations executive director 
instead of sending out christmas cards to friends and 
exchanging gifts we are sending the money to armenia and most 
families are doing that said shakeh kadehjian a secretary in the 
new york office of the armenian evangelical church which celebrates 
christmas dec 25 
most of the people without asking us are canceling their 
wedding ceremonies until after the mourning period ends jan 17 
said rev nareg shrikian of st marys armenian apostolic church in 
glendale calif 
the first reaction among armenians was to cancel everything 
not even to decorate christmas trees said ara kalaydjian editor 
of the armenian mirrorspectator an englishlanguage newspaper 
published in watertown mass the area is home to 3000040000 
armenians 
kalaydjian said he planned a quiet dinner with his family we 
wont exchange gifts we wont have a tree he siad 
edward bogosian editor of the armenian reporter said his 
englishlanguage weekly published in new york ordinarily carries 
announcements of holiday events 
but over the past two weeks he said all the listings carried 
a notation canceled canceled canceled one after another

thousands packed into chinas top art gallery for 
the opening of beijings first painting exhibition devoted entirely 
to the study of nudes 
some leered and shook their heads in disbelief at what they saw 
but many others gazed with obvious appreciation at the works 
poets top government officials schoolchildren young couples 
and workers gathered thursday around the paintings by some of 
chinas best artists 
i feel this exhibition shows we have achieved a little more 
freedom in the past you would never see this said wang xing 22 
a student from beijing teachers college as he viewed a study of a 
man and a woman touching a bird it also shows our level is 
rising the paintings here move me they are beautiful 
underneath everyone is naked and everyone knows their 
nakedness said ai qing who at 79 is chinas best known living 
poet why then when we want to paint our bodies do so many 
chinese think its strange i think it is good 
the exhibition of figure oil painting at the china art gallery 
features 128 paintings by 21 artists gallery official estimated 
that about 20000 people came on the first day paying about 27 
cents each five times the normal admission price 
we have traditional nudes realistic nudes expressionist 
nudes abstract nudes even cubist and deformist nudes said ge 
pengren a painting instructor at the central institute of fine arts 
who organized the show our purpose is to educate the people about 
nudes and to show them through these paintings how we value life 
ge said the exhibition which was approved by the ministry of 
culture before it was opened hadnt met with any major 
interference since it was sanctioned a year ago 
when we chose the paintings there was no censorship at all 
he said 
artistic freedom in china is very limited books and movies have 
to pass through a censor and artists are often restricted in what 
they can create 
during the ultraleftist cultural revolution from 196676 
painters were banned from displaying nude paintings and only in 1978 
were they again allowed to use nude models 
society and the state have been slow in accepting the change 
newspapers carried a report earlier this year about a 19yearold 
girl who suffered a nervous breakdown because of the abuse she 
received for posing nude at the nanjing academy of fine arts 
in recent years only two exhibitions devoted to nudes have 
opened in china in addition a nude mural by yuan yunsheng painted 
in 1979 during a period of relative cultural freedom remains 
covered at the beijing airport 
in the past societys ideas about morality were a little 
backward said ge it was like we were afraid of our bodies 
with this exhibition we want to open a new road 
inded the educational nature of the exhibition is very strong a 
lengthy explanation of the nudes place in art history lines the 
middle of one hall a discussion of the artists work lines another 
we still have to introduce things to the masses said artist 
cao li without this introduction many people wouldnt understand 
at all 
but even with the introduction fu kegan was having a hard time 
im going to stand here until i understand this painting the 
former teacher said as he stood head shaking in front of a gray 
canvas 
the artist told me this is an abstract nude said fu 68 
but it looks like a pile of rocks 
despite his confusion fu said he welcomed such exhibitions 
we hear that nude exhibitions in the west are normal he 
said so why in china should they be so mysterious this show 
could teach people that nude painting isnt dangerous 
it may not be dangerous said wang bing 48 a housewife 
but i think its dirty look at those boys staring at that 
painting 
across the room a pack of 20 men appeared perilously close to 
diving into a painting of two chinese women 
oh there will always be uneducated people fu said but 
maybe this show will teach them to change

the decision by pan american world airways and 
the us government not to alert the public to a fairly specific 
bomb threat received long before pan am flight 103 crashed in 
scotland could raise liability problems for the airline but probably 
not for the government attorneys say 
i dont know of any legal requirement that the us go public 
on a thing like that other than notifying the airline involved and 
possibly the embassies said lee kreindler a new york lawyer who 
specializes in aviation accident cases 
its a difficult area but if the government notifies the 
airline in question i think the government position is justified 
kreindler said thursday 
kreindler said there are some policy reasons from the 
governments standpoint for not notifying the traveling public 
one of the purposes of the federal aviation act is to enhance 
aviation and an announcement of a specific threat which might not be 
bona fide could conceivably result in travelers not flying 
flight 103 originating in frankfurt west germany with a change 
of planes at londons heathrow airport crashed in scotland on 
wednesday killing all 258 people aboard and more than 20 on the 
ground it was bound for new york 
phyllis oakley a state department spokeswoman said that an 
unidentified individual telephoned the us embassy in helsinki on 
dec 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks 
against a pan am aircraft flying from frankfurt to the united states 
the conduit would be an unwitting passenger who would take 
the device from helsinki to frankfurt and then board a usbound 
flight she said 
it has not been established however that the telephoned tip was 
related to the pan am crash 
mrs oakley said dozens of threats are received each day and all 
are taken seriously l paul bremer who heads the state 
departments counterterrorism office said there have been 87 calls 
similar to the helsinki call over the past three months 
but the dec 5 call apparently from a tipster appeared to be 
taken more seriously than most others many us embassies were 
apprised of the threat including the american mission in moscow 
where a notice of the threat was posted on a bulletin board 
no word went out to the general public 
the prior notification is going to raise an interesting 
question in connection with the other passengers who were not 
members of the state department staff whether they should have 
received similar notice from pan am said george n tompkins jr 
a lawyer specializing in defending airlines in accident cases 
bremer said in an interview thursday night that not enough is 
known to conclude that sabotage caused the jumbo jet to crash 
we dont know if this is a terrorist attack he said 
asked what an airlines obligation is once it has been notified 
of a specific threat kreindler said its a tough situation 
they dont have to stop operating or stop flying but certainly they 
have a duty to meticulously inspect 
kreindler said that in some other instances of terrorism 
involving air travel evidencegathering in lawsuits has focused on 
airline security precautions 
officials said pan am stepped up security at key airports in the 
wake of the threat 
anyone filing lawsuits seeking settlements in excess of a 75000 
limit in international airlines cases would have to show willful 
misconduct on the part of the airline in order to be successful 
tompkins said willful misconduct is extremely difficult to prove 
carrying with it a heavier burden of proof than gross negligence 
willful misconduct is a wrongful act done intentionally or an 
improper act done wantonly with knowledge of the probable 
consequences

where fort stewart is located hall bragged to an unidentified fbi 
agent that he had been passing highly sensitive signal 
intelligence documents to both the soviets and the east german 
intelligence services since late 1982 
hall boasted of the important signal intelligence information 
he had passed and admitted his motivation to be greed the 
document said it did not give details on the information 
hall allegedly passed the information through a turkishborn 
naturalized citizen named huseyin yildirim yildirim also was 
arrested wednesday at his home in belleair beach fla near st 
petersburg 
he had been scheduled to appear at a bond hearing thursday but 
the proceeding was postponed until tuesday because yildirims 
attorney had a scheduling conflict 
chapla said hall was moved to facilitate security noting the 
base at fort meade has secure facilities that can be used for 
courtsmartial that involve the presentation of classified material 
as evidence 
fort meade also is the site of the national security agency the 
supersecret spy agency that conducts electronic surveillance around 
the world hall worked in the field of electronic surveillance for 
the army and indirectly the nsa 
the spokesman declined to say whether nsa specialists were 
sitting in on the interrogation of hall 
chapla said hall not been formally charged with any crimes as of 
thursday evening but was being detained under the uniform code of 
military justice for suspicion of espionage he can be held for up 
to three days on that basis chapla said 
according to army records hall held a top secret security 
clearance and spent most of his 12 years in the service at posts in 
west germany where the army maintains electronic listening posts 
and intelligence units that would play critical roles in time of war 
during his service career hall rose in rank to a point where he 
could have provided a detailed and damaging look at our techniques 
and capabilities when it comes to intercepting radio and voice 
traffic and breaking codes explained one official 
but weve got to find out how far he went he could have kept 
his handlers happy with less sensitive stuff too 
added an army source he was a worker bee he had familiarity 
with the techniques and technology of the business of signals 
intelligence its logical to say he could have really hurt us 
chapla said hall had been flown on an army airplane from fort 
stewart to fort meade on thursday afternoon and that in the process 
legal jurisdiction over the warrant officer was shifted to the 
commander of the military district of washington 
that commander is maj gen donald c hilbert should 
investigators recommend a grand jurytype proceeding and court 
martial it will be up to hilbert to decide how to proceed chapla

researchers have infected mice with the aids 
virus for the first time moving the lowly rodent to the front lines 
of the battle against the fatal disease 
mice have long been a staple of biomedical research but until 
scientists in california were able to develop mice with human immune 
systems and then get the aids virus to spread in them the 
animals had been largely useless in aids research 
the main breakthrough getting a human immune system to function 
in mice has had scientists excited since the work was reported in 
science magazine in september 
the current issue of the magazine out today contains an updated 
report from the same stanford university researchers confirming 
their assumption that they would be able to get the aids virus hiv 
to take in their special mice 
mice with standard immune systems are impervious to the aids 
virus 
in another report in science scientists at the national 
institutes of health provided additional information on their 
previously reported success in producing mice that carry the genetic 
code for the aids virus in every cell of their bodies 
a third paper is on the work of scientists at the hospital for 
sick children in toronto canada who have transplanted human bone 
marrow into mice with humanlike immune systems that research is 
geared toward studying such blood diseases as leukemia and sickle 
cell anemia 
as previously reported the human immune system was developed in 
mice by transplanting liver thymus spleen and lymph node cells 
from aborted human fetuses into them 
the significance of all three reports is not in what has been 
learned thus far about aids or any other specific disease but 
rather the demonstrated ability to use mice in new ways 
for example the stanford scientists purposely limited the scope 
of their initial efforts to infect mice with aids to observing them 
for no more than eight weeks too short to lead to fullblown aids 
but enough to show researchers the virus would flourish in their new 
breed of mice 
by limiting the study to eight weeks we cannot yet predict 
whether the mice would get the full aids syndrome said dr irving 
weissman one of the stanford researchers its too early to tell 
this experiment wasnt designed to mimic aids in human patients 
exactly 
in a twist of irony 127 of the 130 the special aidscoded 
mice developed at nihealth died in a freak accident earlier this 
month when the ventalition system in the building housing them was 
cut off too long during repairs 
although it will take four to five months to replenish the nih 
herd anthony s fauci director of the national institute of 
allergy and infectious disease said they are expected to be 
valuable not only for better understanding of hiv effects on tissue 
but also for testing of therapeutics to prevent hivinduced 
disease 
in the nih work complete copies of the aids virus dna were 
injected into fertilized mouse eggs that subsequently were implanted 
into adult female mice 
of the 64 mice born researchers identified seven founder 
mice that contained complete copies of the aids virus dna in their 
chromosomes and subsequently transmitted the copies to their 
offspring 
dr malcolm martin head of the nih team said the accident was 
made worse by the fact that none of the founder mice was among 
the three survivors

the manager of the savannah river nuclear 
material production plant said thursday the facilitys reactors 
which have been shut down because of safety concerns could be 
restarted immediately if necessary 
i certainly think they can be restarted safely said john t 
lowe i think if the nation judged there was a need for the 
materials they could be restarted today 
the plant near aiken sc is the nations sole producer of 
tritium a crucial ingredient in nuclear weapons 
lowe who works for du pont the operator of the us department 
of energy plant said in an interview thursday with the augusta 
chronicle and the augusta herald that political pressures have 
contributed to recent highly publicized problems at the plant 
lowe was interviewed on the same day that energy secretary john 
herrington announced that ultrasonic testing will be used to check 
for possible cracks in reactor vessels that could delay srps 
restart until next summer 
all three savannah river reactors have been shut down since 
summer for safety upgrades and maintenance 
lowe declined to say when he thought the plant would resume 
operations 
i think that remains to be defined there has been speculation 
that it would be six months or 12 months i really think until the 
criteria are well defined its sheer speculation to pick a 
date lowe said

a pentagon official who told congress eight 
major defense contractors were under investigation for possible 
illegal trading of classified documents was mistaken a pentagon 
spokesman said 
the spokesman dan howard said thursday that only four of the 
companies are being investigated 
howard said john f donnelly director of the defense 
investigative service made a mistake when he told the joint 
economic committee on wednesday that litton systems inc mcdonnell 
douglas corp northrop corp and trw inc remain part of the 
pentagons investigation of alleged trafficking of department 
secrets among defense contractors 
investigations of these companies were closed in 1986 howard 
said 
howard said donnelly was correct in listing four other companies 
as remaining under investigation those are general dynamics corp 
boeing co matin marietta corp and saunders associates inc 
donnelly had insisted the eight companies remained under 
investigation even after being told by subcommittee members that 
his testimony was at odds with a government report on the 
investigation 
the pentagon also criticized the congressional panel for making 
the information public we do not approve of the committee making 
public this type of information the department said in a

a predawn kenny loggins concert for 
japanese television drew a lynch mob of pajamaclad residents to 
the stage after they were awakened by the big beat of the 
unauthorized show police said 
our switchboard lit up like the rockefeller center christmas 
tree said police lt don williams complaints began coming in 
shortly before 5 am wednesday the show was set for prime time in 
japan just before 10 pm 
williams said the show from the steps of the historic old mission 
did not have the citys permission and when officers arrived they 
found a wooden stage full of rock musicians speakers electrical 
generators lights and cameras plus a production crew of 75 
the singersongwriter later left without being reached for 
comment 
police shut the show down despite protests from the producer 
james okumura of los angeles who said he would lose millions of 
dollars according to williams officials said permits he had 
requested via facsimile machine a few hours before the show claimed 
it would be low volume 
some officers had to hold back angry neighborhood residents many 
of whom came to the scene in their nightclothes 
understandably it resembled a lynch mob williams said 
the rev virgil cordano of the mission said he had been told the 
production would be quiet and he granted permission for use of the 
building as a backdrop because it was good for santa barbara and 
good for the mission 
i thought i was doing the city of santa barbara a favor and 
spreading the good news to tokyo he said 
the matter will be forwarded to the city attorneys office for 
further review police said 
okumura did not immediately return a telephone message left by

peapackgladstone nj ap its no kings ransom but even 
the monarch from morocco has to enjoy unexpected tax rebates 
the borough council determined this week that king hassan ii of 
morocco had paid too much in 1988 a check of 4894 was sent to 
hassan who owns 500 acres of property in peapackgladstone and two 
adjacent towns 
councilman douglas mcdowell said the refund comes from tax 
appeals heard by the somerset county board of taxation that were not 
contested by the borough 
last month hassan was awarded a 146000 rebate on his county 
taxes because his estate was overappraised the county revised his 
lands appraised value from 2598 million to 73 million 
as a result the monarchs 1988 county tax bill was cut from 
204591 to 57764 
the kings attorney thomas goodwin of saddle river argued 
before county tax officials in october that 225 acres of the kings 
estate should be assessed at cheaper farmland rates for 1988 in 
addition goodwin maintained the remaining 97 acres the monarch owns 
in the borough also were assessed too high 
the kings land is spread over bedminster far hills and 
peapackgladstone

gov ned mcwherter on thursday blocked a 
jan 26 parole hearing for the man convicted in the 1968 sniper 
slaying of civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
mcwherter exercised a law giving the governor authority to halt 
early parole hearings for prisoners convicted of certain crimes 
james earl ray 60 is serving 99 years in prison for 
firstdegree murder of king in memphis on april 4 1968 
a 1985 law designed to reduce prison overcrowding made ray 
eligible for a parole hearing in november 
weve been advised that he ray is among that class of inmates 
who will be affected by that order said jim kennedy mcwherters 
chief of staff 
kennedy said the order was effective immediately for ray who has 
been turned down for early parole at least twice before 
david welles legal counsel for the governor said mcwherters 
decision would not affect rays original parole eligibility date in 
1998 but removes him from consideration for an early release because 
of his escape record 
ray was a fugitive from a missouri prison at the time of kings 
murder he is held at brushy mountain state prison from which he 
escaped in june 1977 and was tracked down and placed briefly on 
death row in nashville 
king was in memphis to assist in a strike by city sanitation 
workers seeking higher pay on the day he was felled by a snipers 
bullet ray was identified from fingerprints found on a rifle near 
the lorraine motel where king was standing on a balcony at the time 
of his death 
ray pleaded guilty on the day of his trial on march 9 1969 but 
retracted his story three days later and has since maintained his 
innocence 
mcwherter had said he opposed rays parole but would not try to 
influence the state board of paroles which is independent from the 
administration

were not real goodlooking guys so we might only use a couple 
of our guys and hire professionals haeck said 
haeck said the company received letters from women demanding the 
second version featuring men 
meanwhile he said the 1989 blazes of glory calendar is 
selling like crazy

justice complex on thursday to distribute candy canes and yuletide 
cheer he sported a real beard jingle bells spectacles rosy 
cheeks and the requisite red suit 
but that didnt prevent the long arm of the law from slapping him 
with a parking ticket at the stateoperated child care center 
i say bah humbug three days before christmas a santa gets a 
ticket said cindy carella who runs the justice juniors center 
which cares for children of state employees 
it seems the officer who spotted his car illegally parked in a 
popular spot outside the states headquarters for law and order 
didnt buy the sign he posted in his window the sign said santa was 
making a brief stop inside at a childrens party 
ms carella said rupell spent about 30 minutes with the 25 
youngsters distributing candy canes and letting them sit on his 
lap because parking is tight at the state building she had told 
him to park in front if he couldnt find a spot 
everyone should have a santa like this she said he even 
ties jingle bells to his pants so he jingles when he walks 
ms carella said she will foot the bill

gov michael dukakis gave presidentelect george 
bush some early praise in his first interview since losing the 
election and said he was still decompressing from the campaign 
and wouldnt want to replay it 
theres not much sense in rerunning the campaign the 
defeated democratic candidate told the associated press on thursday 
i mean we did some things well we did other things not so 
well it wasnt successful obviously im disappointed lots of 
people are disappointed we worked very hard but i dont think its 
something to dwell on 
dukakis declined an opportunity to criticize bush whom he had 
lambasted during a bitter campaign saying he would give the 
presidentelect a good six months to a year before speaking out 
however the governor who attacked president reagans policy in 
central america during the campaign said he was pleased by reports 
that bush has decided not to ask congress immediately for renewed 
us support for the rightist contra rebels in nicaragua and that 
bush hopes to forge a bipartisan consensus and involve latin leaders 
i think its the right policy dukakis said when i met 
with him i strongly urged him to do that i said i think the present 
policy is a failure its getting worse not better 
if thats the way the new administration begins then i think 
thats hopeful the governor said 
dukakis who held one press conference immediately after his loss 
to assess the campaign refused to review the campaign in detail 
saying he preferred to focus on the future 
but he also declined to tip his hand about any plans he may have 
for his own career after his current term as governor ends in 1990 
dukakis has refused previously to say whether he would run for 
president again 
its much too early at this point im decompressing working 
hard on whats happening here enjoying a certain amount of normalcy 
in my life he said 
seated in his statehouse office after a weeks vacation in 
florida dukakis appeared relaxed and reflective more interested in 
his states budget problems than in the national agenda he was 
pushing before losing to bush 54 percent to 46 percent just six 
weeks ago 
its been quite a year and i must say its nice to reflect a 
little bit on the blessings of life welcome my crew home and to 
play the role of father and husband and enjoy and relax a little 
bit dukakis said 
asked if he ever has days when he wishes he could have another 
shot at the campaign or even another week to battle bush dukakis 
said no 
at some point there has to be a conclusion you work hard to 
that day then people go and vote certainly nobody ever suggested 
american presidential campaigns are too short twenty months is a 
long time 
dukakis who had never waged a national political campaign 
before said his biggest surprise was the change that overtook him 
immediately after the democratic national convention in july 
i think the one thing that you never quite experience until you 
experience it is the postconvention period when unfortunately 
you are kind of walled off from citizens communities 
everything you do is a kind of massive public event i found 
that difficult frustrating i dont think its good but it is the 
presidency and the most important political office there is and 
thats the reality dukakis said 
the governor said the process could be improved but at this 
point he said i dont have any brilliant ideas for changing 
it 
asked to evaluate bushs initial appointments and policy 
statements dukakis said its too soon to draw conclusions 
a new president deserves a chance to put a team together and 
get under way everything isnt going to be perfect there will be 
bumps along the way dukakis said 
these are all things that had been deferred swept under the 
rug this kind of thing hes got to deal with them dukakis said

terrorism has been on everyones mind in 
washington for years the toll it has taken is long and painful 
children us servicemen neutral diplomats and even a 
wheelchairbound american tourist are among the victims 
so it was not surprising that clovis maksoud a representative of 
the arab league was short about half his audience thursday when he 
held his annual yearend review in one of washingtons snazzier 
hotels 
the absent reporters who specialize on developments in the middle 
east were busy chasing the possibility that terrorists may have been 
behind the crash of a pan american world airways jumbo jet carrying 
258 passengers in scotland killing them and another 22 people on 
the ground 
the busy reporters might as well have attended maksouds report 
over lunch on developments this year in the middle east and 
expectations for 1989 by days end it was not clear exactly what 
caused the jet to crash 
many experts believe there was an explosion on the plane and 
among them there is widespread suspicion of sabotage but the cause 
could have been heavy winds said l paul bremer who heads the 
state departments office of counterterrorism we dont know if 
this is a terrorist attack 
nonetheless terrorism is in the news again 
just last week the issue dominated the headlines and telecasts 
in what may yet prove to be a positive turn of events 
the united states decided to open a substantive dialogue with 
the palestine liberation organization based on a judgment that 
chairman yasser arafat had renounced terrorism 
no one is making the suggestion publicly or privately that the 
plo had anything to do with the crash in scotland 
but the reagan administration thought it had reached a milestone 
in the struggle against terrorism 
the head of a group secretary of state george p shultz had only 
recently accused of terrorism said the magic words arafat 
condemned by shultz as an accessory suddenly qualified by 
renouncing terrorism and recognizing israel for the 
semirecognition that a substantive dialogue implies 
but with the victory came a burden for arafat and for the 
united states in judging the plo 
each incident will be scrutnized for evidence of complicity to 
see if his renunciation of terrorism in all forms will hold up 
the first us session with the plo was held last friday in 
tunisia assistant secretary of state richard w murphy warned the 
next day that it would be the last if terrorism traceable to the plo 
recurred the warning was echoed by other top us officials 
maksoud who considers the dialogue long overdue detected 
lingering hangups in the warnings he said the us officials 
were a little bit on the defensive unnecessarily as if theyve 
done something wrong but necessary 
maksoud a seasoned observer sees the usplo talks as neither 
the breakthrough claimed in some arab quarters or the threat 
perceived by some israelis and their supporters to him the 
expressions of anxiety are contrived paranoia designed to 
influence the outgoing reagan and incoming bush administrations 
and yet us officials will be watching the plo very closely to 
see if arafats renunciation of terrorism with us prompting 
holds up that could influence whether the bush administration tries 
to persuade israel to negotiate with the plo or lends us support 
to the idea of a palestinian state 
there are problems in keeping watch however 
the plo is a looselyknit organization it is not clear that 
arafat will or can exercise control over all factions nor is it 
clear how much support his statement has within the group 
moreover defining terrorism has always been elusive 
last sunday salah khalaf who is secondincommand to arafat in 
fatah the mainstream plo faction said the chairmans 
denunciation of terrorism in geneva did not include military 
attacks against israel 
khalaf known also as abu iyad added our struggle will 
continue until we raise the plo flag over jerusalem 
on monday a member of the plos executive committee said arafat 
had expressed only his personal opinion in renouncing terrorism 
and recognizing israels right to exist 
in fact mustafa elzibri said the statements were 
incompatible with the resolutions of the latest palestine national 
council meeting 
the state department had detected some positive movement at the 
council meeting but no turnabout in the plos stance

presidentelect bush says he shares president 
reagans determination to prevent a huge libyan chemical weapons 
factory from being used to spread further destruction but will 
not go into detail about means of doing so 
answering reporters questions after announcing his latest 
cabinet appoinments thursday bush said he thought the matter should 
be discussed at an international conference on chemical weapons set 
for jan 6 in paris 
one shouldnt give up on trying to turn around the libyan 
regime he said but what happens beyond that if there is a 
direct refusal to do that what the free world and i think that 
most of the world frankly would mandate then well consider 
options at that time 
asked specifically whether he shared the reagan administrations 
commitment to preventing the spread of chemical weapons by libya he 
said that not only should our administration be committed to that 
but in my view any civilized country around the world should be 
committed to that objective 
and in terms of what means one uses to achieve that end i 
think it would be inappropriate to go into detail he said it 
does seem to me that our allies can help and yes we all ought 
to be committed to seeing that that plant not spread further 
destruction 
meanwhile clovis maksoud the arab leagues representative in 
washington said it was not true that libya was producing 
chemical weapons 
this atmosphere of creating a focus on libya as a scapegoat may 
be an attempt directly or indirectly by the israelis to shift from 
the central challenge of the peace offensive that the plo palestine 
liberation organization and the arabs are undertaking maksoud 
told reporters 
he said the us accusation might give a prior pretext for 
those who want to strike at an arab country in order to prevent the 
maturing of the moderating developments that are taking place in the 
arab world as a result primarily of the arabplo dialogue 
reagan in an interview broadcast thursday evening on abctv 
said military action against the libyan site has been discussed by 
the united states and its allies but thats a decision that has 
not been made yet the portion of the interview containing the 
remark was included in the networks wednesday night newscast 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater asked about the 
presidents remark said the president was quite clear that 
military action is an option were not ruling it out 
the united states is extremely concerned about production 
facilities in libya which we believe can produce enormous 
quantities of chemical weapons fitzwater said 
asked whether a us strike against the facility is under 
consideration the spokesman said im not saying its our 
intention we will not rule out options

the operators of logan international airport 
are vowing to challenge in court a government order that rejects a 
new landing fee system designed to cut traffic at the congested 
boston airfield by discouraging small planes 
the transportation department ruled thursday that logans landing 
fee structure which had been closely watched by the aviation 
community as a possible national precedent was unreasonable 
discriminatory and in violation of federal law 
deputy transportation secretary mimi weyforth dawson signed an 
order that gives the massachusetts port authority seven days to 
rescind its fee structure or lose eligibility for 102 million in 
federal aviation improvement grants for the current fiscal year 
massport officials immediately attacked the ruling 
it sounds like the department of transportation has really just 
given in to political pressure from powerful special interest groups 
and turned its back on millions of air travelers in new england and 
throughout the nation said thomas champion assistant to the 
executive director at massport 
but opponents of the logan plan hailed the ruling as a victory 
for commuter air passengers private plane pilots and smalltown 
america 
this is a tremendous victory for greater public access to our 
major airports said rep silvio o conte rmass author of the 
law that authorized the cutoff of federal funds to logan if the 
transportation department agreed that the landing fees were unfair 
operators of other major airports including those in los 
angeles denver and minneapolis were awaiting the decision to see 
if the stiff fee structure could be used as a model in their own 
battles to reduce air traffic said rep sherwood l boehlert 
rny a leading congressional opponent of the landing fee plan 
small commuter airlines and private plane owners vehemently 
fought against the proposal saying it would lock them out of logan 
and deprive air service to passengers in small communities where 
there is no access to major airlines 
under logans revised fee structure large jets are paying 
significantly less than before while small aircraft had their 
landing fees increase from 25 to more than 100 
logan officials defended the new fee structure which went into 
effect in july after a federal district judge in boston ruled that 
the fees were not discriminatory 
champion said the landing fee plan had succeeded in reducing 
congestion at logan which is the largest airport in new england 
and that access had not been restricted for commuters 
the new fee structure was based on a combination of airplanes 
weight and other operating costs 
the original fee rate charged planes a minimum of 25 or 131 
per 1000 pounds which ever was greater most small planes paid 
25 under the revised fee structure which was increased again in 
october all planes are assessed a 103 flat fee plus 55 cents per 
1000 pounds 
massport executive director david w davis said fees for a boeing 
747 which had ranged up to 800 have been cut roughly in half 
under the new fee structure while the landing fee for a cessna 402 
seating 10 passengers jumped from 25 to about 105

the chairman of the securities and exchange 
commission has questioned the independence of financial advisers who 
tell stockholders a proposed leveraged buyout of their company is a 
good deal 
david s ruder told a house panel thursday that experts who write 
fairness opinions often get higher fees if the deal goes 
through the opinions offer conclusions on the fairness of a buyout 
offer 
asked by rep mike synar dokla whether fairness opinions were 
independent ruder said all in all i am quite suspicious in a 
significant number of cases that the fairness opinion is prepared 
by somebody with an incentive to go along with management 
personally i think that needs to be addressed 
ruder said he was giving the house energy and commerce 
telecommunications and finance subcommittee his personal opinion 
not that of the sec which is currently reviewing all aspects of 
leveraged buyouts 
leveraged buyouts occur when investors borrow heavily to buy out 
a company and then pay off the debt with that companys cash flow or 
by the sale of its assets 
ruder said the commission wants to determine whether it should 
issue new rules to protect investors and predicted the review would 
continue at least through february 
fairness opinions are primary factors in the transactions ruder 
said because shareholders accord a great degree of weight to the 
fact that a favorable opinion has been issued 
the opinions usually attest that the price offered for shares of 
a company is a fair one 
the hired financial adviser must rely almost exclusively on the 
limited information that management supplies about the company 
subcommittee chairman edward markey dmass said an investment 
bank may receive 1 million to prepare the opinion but 15 million 
if the deal goes through 
it sounds a little bit like a kickback to outsiders markey 
said

presidentelect bushs selection of manuel 
lujan jr as interior secretary surprised almost everybody because 
the veteran new mexico congressman said earlier this month he 
wouldnt take the job if it were offered 
lujan 60 is a republican who announced in january he was 
retiring from the house after 10 terms because wife jean and i 
thought it was time to come home 
he changed his mind even after specifically declaring himself out 
of the running for the interior department post lujan told 
reporters earlier this month that bush transition aide chase 
untermeyer had asked him if he would take the job and i told him 
i would not i said i really didnt want to go back into government 
but i might be willing to serve on a board or something like that 
reaction to the appointment was mixed 
its a solid choice hes better than most of the names weve 
been hearing said paul pritchard president of the national parks 
and conservation association a frequent critic of the reagan 
administration 
he will work well with congress and he knows where the bodies 
are buried pritchard said 
but brock evans washington vice president of the national 
audubon society said i have the same heavy feeling in my heart 
that i did eight years ago when james watt was appointed to the 
post by president reagan lujan was a defender of watt during his 
controversial tenure 
we feel as if we had just been given a lump of coal said 
jeff webb president of friends of the earth 
a fiscally conservative mainstream republican from a prominent 
new mexico hispanic political family lujan was the secondranking 
gop member of the house interior and insular affairs committee he 
has devoted most of his time recently to the science space and 
technology committee where he was the senior republican 
because of his withdrawal lujan had hardly figured in 
speculation for the slot and was not on a list of four 
acceptable names submitted to the bush transition team by 
western republican senators 
the choice could be a signal that bush is serious about new 
energy development lujan was a sponsor of the principal bill in 
the last session that would have opened the arctic national wildlife 
refuge to oil exploration 
environmentalists have strongly opposed exploration in that area 
on alaskas north slope 65 miles east of the existing fields at 
prudhoe bay congress took no action on the issue 
the league of conservation voters awarded lujan a low score 13 
out of a possible 100 lujan voted according to the 
environmentalist position only twice out of 16 test votes 
however pritchard said lujan had been responsive to concerns 
about parks and historic preservation 
the wilderness society expressed a split view saying in a 
statement by vice president sydney j butler that though they 
differed on alaska oil development lujan has been accessible to 
the conservation community 
rep leon panetta dcalif who has led the sofar successful 
fight to ban oil exploration in federal waters off central and 
northern california said lujan has not stood in the way of 
measures to protect the california coast and will bring an open 
mind to the issue 
the us chamber of commerce hailed lujan as clearly a friend 
of business with an 80 percent favorable voting record according 
to the chambers tabulation 
lujan who now lives in albuquerque is a 1950 graduate of the 
college of santa fe where he grew up and where his father served as 
mayor in the 1940s 
he will be the second hispanic in the bush cabinet education 
secretary lauro cavazos has been asked by bush to stay on 
i went to washington to balance the budget and we still havent 
done it lujan once said when asked to name his biggest 
disappointment 
in 1986 he suffered a heart attack and underwent a triple bypass 
operation but in january he said he was not leaving congress 
because of ill health rather it was always my fear that i would 
stay too long and not have my health

william reilly presidentelect bushs choice 
to head the environmental protection agency is a former land use 
planner who has spent 15 years leading a foundation that tries to 
solve environmental conflicts through consensus 
reilly who turns 49 on jan 26 is president of the conservation 
foundation and of the us affiliate of the world wildlife fund two 
organizations whose merger he engineered in 1985 
the wildlife fund has concentrated on preservation of wildlife 
and habitat in the tropics urging reversal of worldwide 
deforestation that is clearing total acreage the size of missouri 
each year 
the conservation foundation which reilly took over in 1973 is a 
research group that has sponsored several convocations of industry 
and environmentalists to try to resolve particular local issues 
unlike many washington environmental groups it does not lobby or 
file lawsuits 
the fund has been the nations fastestgrowing environmental 
organization in recent years tripling its membership to 500000 
since 1985 
during bushs announcement ceremony thursday reilly said he 
believed he was the first head of such an organization chosen to run 
the epa and he pledged a new and constructive course on 
environmental problems at home and around the world 
in a recent interview reilly attributed his organizations 
growth to the response to active solicitation among a population 
exposed to a steady diet of nature programs on television 
the public watches enormous amounts of nature films reilly 
said i worry about saturation but people who know about these 
things tell me not to 
and he said the people who elected george bush are worried 
about the international environment 
reilly has paid particular attention to the greenhouse effect 
the global warming predicted to result from the use of fossil 
fuels unlike many environmentalists he has not ruled out nuclear 
power as a benign energy source and he was considering the 
formation of another allviewpoints study group on nuclear power 
he serves on the board of several nonpofit organizations and of 
northeast utilities inc 
he said he believed environmentalists were coming to two new 
awarenessess that the environment is much less under control 
than we believed and the degree to which we appear to be hostage 
to other countries for our health and wellbeing 
though no defender of controversial former interior secretary 
james watt he said watts 1 billion fouryear renovation of 
national park structures made a lot of sense but natural 
systems didnt get the same kind of attention 
on the parks the bush administration has got to take the 
external threats issue seriously thats a tough issue for a 
conservative administration park advocates have complained that 
threats of development up against park boundaries are spoiling many 
parks 
reilly has enjoyed the confidence of the outgoing administrator 
of epa lee m thomas and thomas predecessor william d 
ruckelshaus who turned to the foundation for several studies 
during the reagan administration the foundation has produced 
three major state of the environment documents and among other 
things major studies of groundwater contamination and national 
parks before that it was a pioneer in calling attention to the 
dangers of excessive use of pesticides 
in 1984 the foundation helped organize clean sites inc which 
organizes cleanup of toxic waste by polluting companies themselves 
clean sites was begun with chemical industry money but now gets 
twothirds of its funds elsewhere 
epa backed a major study of wetlands by the foundation and the 
national governors association which recommended last month a goal 
of creating enough new wetlands to more than offset the loss of 
bogs swamps fens marshes and estuaries to development bush has 
endorsed the no net loss goal 
thomas turned to reilly this fall to organize a study of the 
superfund toxic waste cleanup program that would bring industry and 
environmentalists together the environmentalists however objected 
that the study could be a cover for weakening the program and 
declined to participate 
reilly is a protege of former epa administrator russell train 
for whom he worked on the staff of the white house council on 
environmental quality in 19701972 train is now chairman of the 
us world wildlife fund affiliate and of the conservation 
foundation 
train was an adviser to bush on environmental issues and 
solicited support for bush among environmentalists 
thomas hailed reillys selection as being truly outstanding 
ruckelshaus said the country the bush administration the people 
of epa and our environment will all be better off 
this is a positive signal from the presidentelect that he 
intends to carry out his campaign commitments to environmental 
protection said john adams executive director of the natural 
resources defense council 
a graduate of yale university who holds a law degree from harvard 
and a masters degree in planning from columbia reilly was born in 
decatur ill spent his childhood nearby and went to high school in 
fall river mass 
after college graduation in 1962 he served in the army 
practiced law in chicago attended graduate scool and served as 
associate director of the urban policy center before joining the 
council on environmental quality

homelessness and inadequate home heating are 
factors in the jump in the number of freezing deaths in the united 
states which has more than doubled in a decade federal officials 
say 
the national centers for disease control reported thursday that 
in 1985 the latest year for which complete statistics are 
available 1010 people died from exposure to the cold a 137 
percent increase from the 427 deaths reported in 1976 
more research needs to be done but the numbers strongly suggest 
more and more americans are dying from the cold the cdc said 
the vast majority of the deaths were technically due to 
hypothermia decreased body temperature or freezing to death 
its either increased cold which is unlikely or its more 
people exposed to more intense or more frequent stresses from the 
cold said dr edwin kilbourne cdc researcher 
kilbourne said that while its possible that many of the deaths 
were due to inadequate home heating another part of the problem is 
the significant number of people who have no shelter at all to call 
their own 
a person who has to sleep outdoors they certainly run a higher 
risk of problems like hypothermia he said 
social service officials have said the number of homeless people 
has risen in recent years estimates of the number nationwide are as 
high as 3 million 
as the nation ages kilbourne said more research is needed to 
determine just who is freezing to death homeless people typically 
middleaged men who have no shelter from the cold or older people 
less able to withstand low temperatures and possibly living with 
insufficient heat 
in the past at least in certain cases hypothermia has been 
thought of as a problem of middleaged male alcoholics a street 
person we really dont know if that remains the profile 
kilbourne said 
people 60 and older are particularly susceptible to hypothermia 
and account for more than half of all hypothermia deaths according 
to previous studies children under a year old also are at high 
risk although hypothermia deaths are rare in children 
hypothermia prevention programs should focus on persons 
particularly susceptible and those likely to be subjected to 
unusual cold stress the atlantabased cdc said in its weekly 
report 
the agency said special attention should be paid to proper 
nutrition and home heating for the elderly shelter for the homeless 
and precautions for young people in the outdoors such as skiers and 
hikers

predominantly black medical schools in the nation and is a longtime 
advocate of improved health care for disadvantaged americans 
in selecting sullivan on thursday presidentelect bush fulfilled 
his pledge to name a black to his cabinet but the muchanticipated 
nomination was assured only after sullivan quelled a lastminute

sunday in which sullivan said he supports a womans right to seek an 
abortion though he opposes federal assistance for it 
on monday sullivan wrote a letter to the atlanta journal and the 
atlanta constitution saying he is opposed to abortion except in 
cases of rape incest and where the life of the mother is 
threatened a statement mirroring bushs views and one which he 
repeated at the presidentelects side in washington on thursday 
sullivan also declared that the nation must address the 
disparity that exists in the availability and quality of health 
care for americans of differing economic means

doctor sullivan is an unusually able physician and 
administrator said hugh gloster retired president of morehouse 
college who hired sullivan 
he tends to delegate but he handles the important things 
himself he makes the big presentations 
he described sullivan as a charismatic man whose selection to 
head the school was the result of an extensive national search i 
doubt if there is anyone better qualified he said 
at morehouse sullivan oversees a faculty and staff of about 100 
and currently has no teaching assignments 
the medical school separated from morehouse college in 1981 when

edward j derwinski a surprise nominee to 
become the first secretary of the new department of veterans 
affairs is a former longtime illinois congressman who lost his 
seat at the hands of redistricting 
derwinskis selection thursday by presidentelect bush surprised 
advocates for veterans groups and those who deal with veterans 
issues in congress because he has dealt little with issues of 
concern to veterans 
ill admit it was a surprise to me said rep gv 
montgomery dmiss chairman of the house veterans affairs 
committee his name had never even surfaced 
one congressional aide described the capitol hill reaction as a 
giant shock 
derwinski 62 did not serve on veterans committees in congress 
and since then he has worked at the state department however 
initial reaction among veterans and their advocates was supportive 
i think hell be a strong and balanced advocate to be sure 
veterans get their share of whatever pie is available for 
allocation said gen richard g stilwell a retired army officer 
who served as deputy undersecretary of defense in the reagan 
administration 
montgomery who successfully pushed legislation to upgrade the 
veterans administration to a cabinet level department called him 
a fine choice 
he has a great wit that will be an asset as he tackles this 
tough new job montgomery said a number of us who sponsored the 
cabinetlevel job were looking for a strong spokesman for veterans 
i believe we have the right person in derwinski 
john hanson spokesman for the american legion said derwinski 
has spoken twice to legion meetings on international issues 
weve worked with him before hanson said hes been 
friendly and we look forward to seeing him again 
derwinski has been undersecretary of state for security 
assistance science and technology a post he assumed in april 1987

loud sportcoats and for his puckish humor 
at the va he will head a huge bureacuracy with 240000 
employees a budget of more than 10 billion and the largest 
hospital system in the nation 
the va has undergone serious financial difficulties as a result 
of budget constraints at a time when more veterans are becoming 
elderly and are in need of care at va hospitals nursing homes and 
other medical facilities 
the current administrator thomas turnage has come under fire in 
congress as a result of cutbacks in hospital care critics have 
faulted him for failing to aggressively seek larger budget 
appropriation requests within the administration 
in hearings earlier this year montgomerys committee heard 
testimony that 8000 to 10000 of the vas 72000 beds had been put 
out of service because of money problems 
its not going to be an easy job because at the start of the 
new congress were going to have to seek additional funds 
montgomery said were turning away patients now we just never 
have gotten enough money to run them hes got his work cut out for 
him 
derwinski a chicago native served in the army in the pacific 
during world war ii he was a member of congress from 1959 to 1983 
from illinois 4th congressional district he served on the foreign

spain has turned into one of the american 
farmers richest overseas markets but agriculture department trade 
analysts say the character of those shipments are changing rapidly 
for example since the entry of spain into the european economic 
community in 1986 us exports of wheat and feed grains have fallen 
dramatically says the departments foreign agricultural service 
but other kinds of products including many highvalue items 
have taken up much of the slack in the fiscal year that ended sept 
30 the total value of us farm exports to spain was 848 million 
up 30 percent from 652 million in 198687 
an important factor is the thriving spanish economy which has 
helped create new and expanded demand for processed or 
semiprocessed foods that carry higher price tags than the 
traditional bulk commodities 
spains gross national product or the sum of its goods and 
services grew 55 percent in 1987 the highest in europe and is 
expected to gain nearly that much in 1988 the agency said thursday 
in a report 
however at more than 19 percent unemployment remains the 
countrys most compelling economic and social problem the report 
added 
the surge last fiscal year put spain among the worlds top 10 
markets for us agricultural exports leading commodities included 
soybeans and soybean meal corn and corn gluten feed tallow hides 
skins walnuts peas beans lentils seeds yellow grease prunes 
and poultry meat 
further the report said the united states supplied all of 
spains imported almonds and half of its imported cattle semen 
increasing disposable income a more urban and youthful 
population and larger numbers of working women have resulted in 
greater interest in convenience items fast foods and more eating 
outside the home the report said patronage of restaurants 
traditionally is high 
the report added although the standard threehour business 
lunch endures consumption of fast foods and snacks is increasing 
numerous tourists and the growing number of spaniards who have 
traveled abroad tend to encourage greater interest in new food 
ideas 
as an eec member spains food processing industry has become a 
prime takeover target for investment by many kinds of multinational 
companies and this shows little sign of subsiding the report said 
meanwhile spain makes up an important part of the eecs total 
market for us agricultural products last fiscal year us 
shipments to the 12nation trading bloc totaled 75 billion with 
spain accounting for more than 11 percent 
japan was the secondlargest market and the biggest for a single 
country with 73 billion in 198788 others in the top 10 
included south korea 23 billion canada 2 billion soviet 
union 19 billion mexico 17 billion taiwan 16 billion 
egypt 800 million iraq 700 million and china 600 million

the agriculture department says the soviet 
union and china have added 14 million metric tons of us grain to 
their 1989 granaries including wheat sold to beijing at subsidized 
prices 
moscows order announced thursday was for an additional 1 million 
metric tons of corn for delivery under a recently extended supply 
agreement between the two countries china bought 400000 tons of 
wheat under the subsidy program 
the latest sales by private exporting companies brought total 
corn sold to the soviets to almost 803 million tons in the 
agreements sixth year which began oct 1 last year us corn 
sales to the soviet union totaled slightly less than 52 million 
tons 
exporters are required to report foreign grain sales of 100000 
tons or more to the usda within 24 hours smaller sales are reported 
weekly 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 1 million tons of 
corn would be about 394 million bushels 
corn prices have been averaging about 261 per bushel at the 
farm level according to usda estimates meaning that the latest 
sale could have a farm value of around 103 million 
although no wheat has yet been sold for 198889 delivery under 
the pact the soviets have ordered 500000 tons of soybeans and 
532500 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of grain sorghum 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said seven export companies were 
involved in the sale of 400000 tons of wheat to china some 147 
million bushels having an estimated farm value of 58 million at 
recent prices 
the companies included cargill inc 90000 tons central states 
enterprises 40000 tons nissho iwai american corp 30000 tons 
bunge corp 40000 tons tradigrain inc 50000 tons tradecom 
inc 30000 tons and louis dreyfus corp 120000 tons 
sims said the sales were part of an authorized 1 million tons of 
wheat announced on dec 7 under the export enhancement program or 
eep with the latest sales china now has 210000 tons remaining 
under the authorization 
the program enables exporters to sell wheat and other designated 
commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to 
meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or subsidies 
sims said the bonuses due the seven exporters for the latest deal 
averaged 2310 per ton of wheat or about 63 cents per bushel

the us dollar rose friday against the japanese yen 
for the second consecutive day while share prices closed lower on 
the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar opened higher at 12490 yen and continued to edge up 
finishing the weeks trading at 12495 yen up 033 yen from 
thursdays close it had gained 040 yen on thursday 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues a 7642point 
gainer the previous day fell 8835 points or 030 percent closing 
at 2968626 
a currency dealer described trading as light due to a dearth of 
news regarding exchange rates 
the dollar may have moved up somewhat but its nothing major 
because market participants are sticking to the sidelines ahead of 
the weekend the dealer said speaking anonymously 
but on thursday bank of japan gov satoshi sumita said the 
foreign exchange market was stabilizing in the wake of the dollars 
recent sharp decline he also said the central bank would continue 
to monitor the market 
securities dealers attributed the bullish tokyo stock market to 
stable currency exchange rates and a waitandsee mood ahead of the 
new year holiday period 
most foreign players seem to be out of town for the christmas 
break and as a result the whole market is slowing down said a 
trader with a tokyo securities company 
another dealer said investors were trading actively ahead of the 
expected demise of the 87yearold emperor hirohito who has been 
seriously ill for over three months 
the market will very likely slow down when the emperor passes 
away said the dealer at sanyo securities co speaking on 
condition of anonymity but on the other hand there is apparently 
a huge amount of excess money in investors hands so many of them 
feel it is time to invest 
hirohito has been bedridden since sept 19 when he vomited blood 
due to internal hemorrhaging share prices have tended to dip in 
recent days in reaction to reports on his worsening health

south africa and angola say they will 
continue supporting rebels fighting each others governments 
despite having signed a pact pledging not to interfere in each 
others domestic affairs 
foreign ministers of south africa cuba and angola signed the 
agreement thursday granting independence to southwest africa which 
will become the new nation of namibia in 1991 it has been ruled by 
south africa since world war i 
the pact also stated that 50000 cuban troops in angola will 
withdraw under un supervision 
the signatories affirmed the principle of noninterference in 
the internal affairs of states and promised not to allow their 
territory to be used in connection with any acts of war 
aggression or violence against the territorial integrity 
inviolability of borders or independence of any state of 
southwestern africa 
pretoria backs rebels fighting to overthrow angolas marxist 
government and angola harbors bases of the african national 
congress which is fighting south africas whiteled government 
afonso van dunem angolas foreign minister told reporters the 
anc is carrying out a just fight in the name of all humanity against 
apartheid therefore the anc will continue to receive the solidarity 
and support from our government and our people 
he denied south africa is part of southwestern africa saying 
that region encompasses only angola and namibia 
but he refused to say whether the anc will be allowed to maintain 
several bases in angola 
at a separate news conference south africas foreign minister 
rf botha was asked if his country would suspend assistance to 
angolan rebels known as unita 
i would be telling you a lie if i say to you that we can 
suddenly end our friendship with unita he replied we will 
remain sympathetic to that organization friendship cannot be 
terminated in this manner 
he promised however that south africa would not violate the 
accords suggesting it will continue with political and diplomatic 
support of the rebels but will not send weapons 
botha said if the anc is allowed by angola to continue to 
operate as theyve done up to now from angolan territory to kill 
members of the civilian population of south africa that would be a 
clearcut violation of the various agreements 
chester a crocker the us assistant secretary of state who 
mediated talks leading to the accords told reporters wednesday the 
question of support for rebels was a matter between angola and south 
africa 
crocker secretary of state george p shultz un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and other diplomats 
watched the signing of the accords thursday 
with the independence of namibia africas last colonial 
question will have been resolved shultz said 
the agreement calls for a oneyear transition to independence for 
namibia beginning april 1 
under the pact half the 50000 cuban soldiers are to pull out by 
nov 1 when namibia is to hold its first free elections for a 
national assembly the rest must be gone by july 1 1991 
foreign ministers isidoro malmierca of cuba and van dunem of 
angola then signed an agreement under which 70 un peacekeepers 
will monitor the cuban withdrawal 
a security council plan for namibias independence calls for 
about 2000 civilian administrators and military police to back 
about 7500 un peacekeepers as south african troops withdraw and a 
civilian government is organized 
the southwest african peoples organization which has fought 
south african forces in namibia more than 20 years was not part of 
the accords but said it will honor a ceasefire 
angolan guerrillas also were excluded 
south africa has controlled namibia a mineralrich territory of 
about 12 million people since capturing it from germany in world 
war i it refused to leave despite un opposition to its presence 
there

reflecting the climate of detente between 
the united states and the soviet union the united nations 43rd 
general assembly concluded its most harmonious session 
the buoyant sometimes tumultuous session that ended thursday was 
highlighted by president reagans farewell mikhail s gorbachevs 
showstopping debut and the assemblys decision for the first time 
to leave new york and travel to geneva to hear yasser arafat 
the 12week session adopted most resolutions by consensus 
including for the first time the afghanistan resolution 
recognizing the soviet troop withdrawal 
it adopted the un budget without a divisive note wednesday 
the first time the financial plan was adopted without a vote since 
the world body was founded 42 years ago 
the 199091 budget of 176 billion was about 22 million less 
than the last its adoption by consensus and the lower expenditure 
were viewed as a us victory 
dante caputo the general assembly president and argentinas 
foreign minister told the closing session the assembly had 
benefited from the new international climate of detente and 
cooperation between the united states and the soviet union and had 
contributed to it 
caputo said the consensus within the 159member assembly was 
unprecedented in the history of the organization 
the world body even charmed its most strident critic the united 
states which committed itself during the session to repay nearly 
500 million owed to the un budget and peacekeeping forces the 
money had been withheld for years for ideological budgetary and 
other reasons 
relations strained during most of the eightyear reagan 
administration eased considerably and when reagan delivered his 
final speech in september he praised the world body for its 
peacekeeping and peacemaking in afghanistan iran and iraq and 
elsewhere 
before the session ended the united nations played host at the 
signing of an agreement granting independence to southwest africa 
better known as namibia it was signed thursday by south africa 
angola and cuba which agreed to withdraw its 50000 troops from 
angola 
the assembly will reconvene in midjanuary to discuss financial 
questions and funding of a un monitoring force in southwest 
africa 
gorbachev the soviet president delivered a tour de force of 
soviet diplomacy at the assembly this month promising unilaterally 
to cut 500000 soviet troops and many jet fighters in europe and 
asia 
in december the united states refused plo chairman arafat a visa 
to address the general assembly 
the plo is an honored un invitee and in protest the assembly 
voted overwhelmingly to move to geneva to hear arafat 
there arafat explicitly recognized israels right to exist 
renounced terrorism and called for direct talks with israel 
the united states announced it would end a 13year ban and open a 
dialogue with the plo changing the entire middle east landscape and 
opening new possibilities for peace

alien supporters of a marxist palestinian 
group may not be deported because even noncitizens have the first 
amendment right to espouse antiamerican beliefs a judge ruled in 
gutting a mccarthyera law 
in this case the government is trying to stifle certain ideas 
from entering our society from certain aliens us district judge 
stephen v wilson said 
our society however was built on the premise that only 
through the free flow of ideas can our nation grow and prosper 
wilsons ruling thursday struck down four provisions of the 1952 
mccarranwalter act that allowed the government to deport aliens who 
advocated or were associated with groups espousing antiamerican 
ideologies including communism 
he said the sections of the law passed during a time when sen 
joseph mccarthy rwis was whipping up cold war fears against 
communism were overbroad and could cause deportation for 
something as simple as wearing a political button 
now i feel i can speak freely i did not an hour ago said 
khader hamide 34 one of the eight defendants the government had 
sought to deport for allegedly supporting the popular front for the 
liberation of palestine a marxist member of the palestine 
liberation organziation 
in his ruling wilson also threw out an exception to a 1987 law 
that recognized free speech rights in deportation proceedings for 
all immigrants except members of the plo 
wilson acknowledged world concern over terrorist threats but said 
his decision would not interfere with congress ability to enforce 
laws already in place to deal with terrorism 
our decision today will not significantly deplete the 
governments arsenal in combating terrorism said wilson whose 
ruling applies only to central and southern california 
michael p lindemann the justice departments lead attorney in 
the case said the ruling would be appealed he declined further 
comment 
paul hoffman of the american civil liberties union which helped 
in the defense said the longterm effects of wilsons ruling would 
not be evident until all appeals are resolved 
however he predicted the case will be resolved by the us 
supreme court and could create a landmark precedent in first 
amendment law 
the case involved seven jordanians of palestinian descent and a 
kenyan who were arrested two years ago held without bail and 
subjected to deportation proceedings under the 36yearold law an 
immigration judge released them after prosecutors refused to present 
their allegations in public demanding a secret forum that was 
refused 
the government eventually dropped mccarranwalter proceedings 
against all but two although it sought deportation of the others on 
technical grounds 
wilson cited the landmark 1969 decision in brandenburg vs ohio 
in which the supreme court held that the government can only 
prohibit speech directed toward inciting imminent lawless action 
the judge also ruled that the plo exception to the 1987 foreign 
relations authorization act violated guarantees of due process and 
equal protection under the law 
the arabamerican antidiscrimination committee sued the justice 
department on behalf of the immigrants joined by the aclu and the 
new yorkbased center for constitutional rights 
we feel as a community now we can speak our minds on the 
palestinian issue said hamide 34 we can speak our minds on 
the uprising on the west bank and in gaza and express our opinions 
freely without the fear of being put in jail 
david cole of the center for constitutional rights said the 
ruling on the plo exception means that congress cannot make 
politically motivated distinctions in providing first amendment 
rights to aliens

a hightech smuggling ring involving dozens of 
companies and 10 countries was left in disarray by the arrest of a 
man charged with trying to sneak a computer to the soviet bloc the 
us customs service said 
eddy gorandus haaks arrest and the seizure of the 11 million 
vax computer last week culminated an eightmonth investigation said 
patrick obrien special agent in charge of customs in miami 
the digital equipment corp vax 8800 mainframe computer seized at 
miami international airport is capable of upgrading and controlling 
systems that launch and guide ballistic missiles operate radar or 
run a mass transit system 
it is on a federal list that regulates the exportation of 
technologically advanced products and likely would have been used by 
the soviet defense system obrien said 
by getting one of these computers they have saved themselves 
10 years and hundreds of millions of dollars in research and 
development said michael sheehan another customs spokesman 
these countries are walking from the stone age into the 21st 
century in one step at the expense of the united states and theyre 
using this technology for interests contrary to united states 
interests 
obrien said the soviet defense system began converting to vax 
computers earlier in the 80s 
but they cannot build their own the only way they can get it 
is through the united states obrien said if we can deny them 
from taking ours they have to build the factories it comes out of 
their defense budget and really slows them down 
customs officials said the investigation includes companies 
brokers and shippers in boston chicago new york newark nj 
houston grand rapids mich and bulgaria yugoslavia romania 
hungary belgium austria libya iran and iraq 
at least one arrest was expected in chicago and boston and 
others were possible sheehan said 
we need to determine whether these companies that transported 
and modified the goods were involving knowingly sheehan said 
the brokers are the people that were after obrien added 
they are the people who are going to take it from legitimate 
industry and give it to illegitimate industry 
there are other smuggling networks of similar scope sheehan said 
haaks network this year has purchased and diverted numerous vax 
computers the system mostly highly sought by the soviets obrien 
said those computer systems and others smuggled to soviet countries 
during the past few years are worth tens of millions of dollars he 
said 
agents arrested haak on dec 14 after he paid 50000 in swiss 
francs to undercover agents obrien said they had promised to help 
haak smuggle the computer to bulgaria the soviet blocs center for 
computer technology obrien said 
haak 42 is a dutch national who lives in belsele belgium a 
grand jury returned a threecount indictment charging him with 
conspiring to illegally export computer equipment from the united 
states to bulgaria 
if convicted of all counts haak could receive a maximum sentence 
of 35 years in prison and a 575 million fine 
a federal magistrate on thursday denied bond for haak after 
prosecutors said he would probably flee this country if allowed to 
post bail

the second consecutive day in tokyo today while share prices 
declined in slow trading ahead of the yearend holiday period 
traders said 
the dollar opened higher at 12490 yen and edged up a bit more 
finishing the weeks trading at 12495 yen up 033 yen from its 
close on thursday when it gained 040 yen

the 225isssue nikkei stock average which gained 7642 points 
the previous day lost 8835 points or 030 percent closing at 
2968626 
volume in the first section was estimated at a light 600 million 
shares down from almost 734 million shares traded thursday 
most foreign players seem to be out of town and as a 
result the whole market is slowing down said a broker based with 
a tokyo securities company 
shipping stocks declined sharply following an announcement this 
morning that yamashitashinnihon steamship co and japan line ltd 
had agreed to merge next june to form one of the countrys largest 
shippers 
in a statement the two companies said the merger was necessary 
to resolve an operational crisis caused by a slump in the shipping 
sector brought on by the strong yen and the oil crises of the 1970s 
the decline in shipping stocks also led to sell orders for steel 
nonferrous metals heavy electrials and auto shares market reports 
said 
there are no foreign exchange dealings on saturday but the tokyo 
stock exchange will be open for a halfday session

the owner of a yacht that once belonged 
to adolf hitler wants to torpedo the boat and turn it into a habitat 
for fish because hes fed up with the controversy surrounding it 
after seven years 
it looks like were finally reaching the end of this 
hitlerboat business once and for all said jj nelson who 
also owns a1 marine and commercial wrecking in jacksonville 
nelson came into possession of the 89foot ostwind boat in 1981 
after it was abandoned on his property 
vice mayor abe resnick a holocaust survivor wants to sink the 
50yearold dilapidated boat to benefit marine life off miami beach 
and mark next years 50th anniversary of the voyage of the damned 
were gonna do whatever resnick wants to do with this thing 
nelson said thursday 
we want to barge it to off of miami beach and apparently the 
jewish community will be happy to take it and watch it burn and 
sink i wish it good riddance myself 
resnick is pushing for city financing to tow the boat out to sea 
and sink it but the city commission still must approve the money 
we want to apply the same solution to the ostwind that hitler 
was trying to apply to the jews said resnick a concentration 
camp survivor who escaped and joined the resistance 
the sinking of the vessel would coincide with the anniversary of 
the 1939 voyage in which the ship st louis left from hamburg 
germany with 900 jews aboard at the beginning of world war ii they 
were refused entry into cuba and the united states eventually they 
returned to europe where as many as 700 of them were believed to 
have been killed by the nazis 
nelson has unsuccessfully tried to sell the boat 
these nazis in chicago want it but they want to make a shrine 
out of it i would rather see it disposed of by the jewish community 
in miami nelson said my company can even blow it up or sink 
it if they want us to

a year before bess myerson went on trial for 
allegedly bribing a judge to fix her lovers divorce case an old 
friend said the former miss america was thinking very positively 
what it means to her life 
she is saying im going to create a new bess myerson 
marilyn funt told a reporter 
if a new bess myerson exists she was the smiling composed 
seemingly confident woman who strode up the steps of the federal 
courthouse each weekday for the past four months 
but once she sat down inside she was forced to listen to tales of 
the old bess myerson a woman who was at the least eccentric 
her lawyers term and possibly dominated by what the prosecutor 
called greed and vengeance 
the issue for jurors was whether miss myerson tried to bribe 
judge hortense gabel who was handling the divorce of miss myersons 
lover carl andy capasso 
miss myerson the former commissioner of the city department of 
cultural affairs allegedly hired mrs gabels daughter sukhreet 
in return it was charged the judge reduced capassos support 
payments 
on thursday evening the federal jury acquitted miss myerson 
mrs gabel and capasso 
despite the verdict the image of bess myerson the first jewish 
miss america a key political ally of mayor edward i koch a 
successful consumer advocate a popular tv personality was 
tarnished by her trial 
miss myerson never took the stand to speak for herself but 
according to the testimony of others she was cheap secretive and 
vindictive 
she was described as a woman worth 7 million who kept her jewels 
in a toolbox and once recycled a bouquet of flowers shed received 
by changing the card and having them delivered to mrs gabel 
a witness said she made numerous telephone calls on a private 
line to the judges chambers often using aliases including helen 
goodman and mrs robinson 
she didnt want daytime visitors at capassos beachfront estate 
to know she had stayed overnight so she would walk out the 
kitchen door and come in the front door as if she had just 
arrived according to the housekeeper 
she invited sukhreet gabel to accompany her to a party but 
insisted she use her former husbands name ms gabel was divorced 
in 1980 instead of the maiden name she shares with her mother 
one night in june 1986 miss myerson went to ms gabels 
apartment house dressed in a gray sweatsuit a headband and 
lavendertinted sunglasses she refused to give her name to the 
doorman 
on a walk around the block miss myerson allegedly told ms gabel 
you could be dangerous and warned her to keep your mouth 
shut 
witnesses recalled how she pointed out capassos estranged wife 
on the street one day as an evil woman and celebrated with 
capasso after his payments were reduced 
moreover expectations were low when the trial began for miss 
myerson had been arrested for shoplifting in williamsport pa she 
looked old and disheveled in newspaper photographers and was 
reported to have been arrested earlier in london on a similar charge 
but in the end miss myersons eccentricities paled to her 
accusers 
sukhreet gabel a plump chatty often fatuous woman who enjoyed 
the attention as much as miss myerson disdained it said 
electroshock therapy for depression had left her memory like swiss 
cheese and parlayed her status as the prosecutions key witness 
into at least a fleeting celebrity

cheers broke out and former miss america bess 
myerson sobbed and kissed her codefendant lover after their 
soapoperalike divorcefixing trial ended in acquittals 
its over miss myerson said after her twoyear ordeal ended 
with thursday nights verdict im grateful for the american 
judicial system and i thank the jury for exonerating me

charge in the sixcount indictment

gabel daughter of miss myersons codefendant sat dazed several 
rows behind her 
after the jurys final announcement miss myerson wiped away 
tears and crossed the courtroom to hug ms gabels frail mother she 
then broke down and cried into her hands as capasso massaged her 
back and neck 
miss myerson 64 who was miss america in 1945 had stared 
intently at the jury as they entered the courtroom shortly after 8 
pm and delivered their verdict rejecting the prosecutions 
contention thatthe three were guilty of conspiracy mail fraud and 
briberelated charges 
the jury had been sequestered by judge john keenan since monday 
when they began weighing the evidence from the 12week trial 
i really feel that given the prosecutions case i had no other 
choice but to say not guilty said the forewoman 
jay goldberg capassos lawyer said had it not been bess 
myerson us attorney rudolph giuliani would have never brought 
this case 
but giuliani whose office has rarely lost a major case 
disagreed 
i think we would try this case again sure said giuliani 
obviously were disappointed with the result 
miss myerson the citys former cultural affairs commissioner 
was accused of trying to bribe mrs gabel by giving a city job to 
sukhreet the judges emotionally troubled daughter in return 
prosecutors said the judge reduced capassos alimony payments with 
his exwife nancy 
capasso a millionaire contractor is serving a threeyear 
sentence in the lewisburg pa prison for pleading guilty to 
federal tax evasion charges in january 
before he was taken back into custody by marshals he offered a 
oneword opinion outstanding

on the stand testifying against her mother and reveled in the 
subsequent attention and publicity 
everybodys a winner the truth came out said ms gabel 
ms gabel testified how miss myerson began cultivating her 
friendship in the summer of 1983 how her mother looked very sad 
when she asked about her involvement in the capasso divorce case 
and how miss myerson confronted her in june 1986 during the grand 
jury investigation telling her you could be dangerous keep 
your mouth shut 
ms gabel said she was happy for bess and andy a sentiment 
shared by another prosecution witness mayor edward i koch 
the mayor whose once close relationship with miss myerson 
unraveled amid the corruption charges said simply im glad for 
her as a personal friend 
koch who benefited from miss myersons friendship and celebrity 
when he was an unknown congressman running for mayor in 1977 was 
uncharacteristically subdued and barely looked at miss myerson as he 
testified 
the trial which began oct 4 captured the publics imagination 
with its tales of high jinks and low comedy among new yorks movers 
and shakers 
while prosecutors alleged miss myerson tried to buy justice in 
the courts of new york her lawyers ridiculed the case as a soap 
opera not a criminal trial

it began as the bess mess but at times it seemed 
to have turned into the sukhreet circus even as the trial of bess 
myerson was threatening to destroy the career of one celebrity it 
was creating another 
she was sukhreet gabel daughter of the judge whom miss myerson 
allegedly tried to influence 
throughout the trial her antics which included singing in a 
cabaret and having a facial makeover on television amused enraged 
and generally fascinated new yorkers 
no one seemed quite certain what to make of this bubbly rotund 
woman who spoke candidly of undergoing electroshock therapy for 
depression who spoke of her love for her mother as she testified 
against her and who giggled as she discussed obscene telephone 
calls to her home 
ive been portrayed as mad by more people than i can count 
ms gabel said and ive gone public to say to people well see 
how mad you think i am 
ms gabel 39 went public in a big way she spent nine days on 
the witness stand testifying as the prosecutions star witness 
against her mother former state supreme court justice hortense 
gabel and miss myerson the 1945 miss america and the citys former 
cultural affairs commissioner 
ms gabel allegedly was hired by ms myerson for a 19000ayear 
city job in order to influence mrs gabel the 75yearold judge was 
handling the divorce case of ms myersons lover carl andy 
capasso 
a federal jury thursday evening acquitted the three of all 
charges 
ms gabel stood beside her mother after the verdict gently 
rubbing the exjudges shoulder while congratulating her 
while mrs gabel told reporters her daughter had simply told the 
truth and supported her us attorney rudolph giuliani admitted the 
government might have been better off with a more stable witness 
than the flighty sukhreet 
in many many cases we bring there are witnesses with a whole 
history of problems said giuliani you dont have the chance to 
pick your witnesses 
the scene between the gabels after the verdict came as no 
surprise to those who watched mrs gabel warmly greeting her 
daughter each day as the younger woman arrived to testify against 
her 
my mother and i have truly never gotten along better said 
ms gabel 
she insisted her testimony contained no smoking gun that 
proved her mothers guilt nor any clear evidence that would 
exonerate her 
but she added based on what i know of my mother 
corruption and the selling of office is about the farthest thing i 
can think of from her modus operandi 
ms gabels own modus operandi has included a wide streak of 
zaniness best exemplified by her cabaret performance at a recent 
birthday party for village voice columnist michael musto among the 
songs she sang let the punishment fit the crime 
she also appeared on a television talk show people are 
talking to receive new makeup hairstyle and clothes selected by 
a fashion consultant 
ms gabel who changed her name from julie bess to an indian 
word for happiness clearly has enjoyed her celebrity 
her next step 
i guess ill breathe a sigh of relief and look for a job she 
said after the verdict 
she is thinking of writing a book and has toyed with the idea of 
a career in news and entertainment two fields she knows 
intimately by now

prime minister rajiv gandhi of india ended a visit 
to china today with the two nations expressing a common desire to 
improve ties after nearly three decades of strained relations 
gandhi accompanied by his wife sonia departed for home from 
shanghai after his fiveday visit the first by an indian head of 
government since his grandfather jawaharlal nehru visited in 1954 
both sides said the visit ushered in a new era of good will 
between the worlds most populous nations gandhi said his trip 
marked a new beginning for the two countries 
during the visit the countries agreed to set up a joint working 
group to take up their most divisive issue a territorial dispute 
that broke out into a short border war in 1962 
the leaders of the two countries held earnest indepth 
discussions on the indiachina boundary question and agreed to 
settle this question through peaceful and friendly consultations 
a joint communique said 
it added they also agreed to develop their relations actively 
in other fields and work hard to create a favorable climate and 
conditions for a fair and reasonable settlement of the boundary 
question 
it said gandhis talks with chinese premier li peng were held 
in an atmosphere of friendship candidness and mutual 
understanding gandhi also met with senior leader deng xiaoping 
communist party head zhao ziyang and president yang shangkun 
the border issue gandhi said is very complicated and a 
quick solution is unlikely 
china claims 36000 square miles of mountainous frontier in what 
new delhi says is northeast indias arunachal pradesh province 
india says china illegally occupies 14500 square miles on its 
western border 
the communique said china expressed concern over antichina 
activities by some tibetan elements in india and that the indian 
side repeated its policy of recognizing tibet as a part of china and 
banning tibetans from carrying out antichinese political activities 
on indian soil 
india has been the home of tibets religious leader the dalai 
lama and thousands of his followers who fled tibet after an 
abortive antichinese uprising in 1959 china blames supporters of 
the dalai lama for proindependence activities that have led to 
violent clashes with police the past 14 months 
gandhi on thursday presided over the signing of three bilateral 
agreements a civil aviation accord calling for direct flights 
between new delhi and beijing a threeyear cultural agreement and a 
science and technology agreement 
the communique said premier li accepted an invitation to visit 
india but no date was set 
china grappling with economic problems at home has made a 
commitment to improving relations with its neighbors 
soviet president mikhail gorbachev is expected to visit china 
next year becoming the first soviet leader to do so in 30 years 
china will likely normalize relations with the soviet union 
during the visit the two countries fought a border war in 1969

police said today their investigation 
into the brutal slaying of a 26yearold american teacher is 
focusing on friends and students who knew her 
investigators said they have questioned more than 25 teachers and 
students who were acquaintances and friends of carolyn joyce abel 
the lafayette ind woman found stabbed to death tuesday 
the korea herald today quoted an unidentified investigator at the 
kangnam police station as sayingwe suspect the murder was a crime 
of passion or a personal grudge in view of its savagery 
violent crime is relatively uncommon in south korea and personal 
attacks on foreigners are unusual 
ms abel was found dead in her apartment of multiple stab wounds 
including a slashed throat 
the herald quoted police as saying investigators believe the 
attacker cut her throat after inflicting the other wounds 
it seems that the attacker cut her throat to make sure she was 
dead because he feared her possible survival police were quoted 
as saying it leads us to suppose the victim knew her attacker 
well 
police said they questioned several korean students who had 
frequented ms abels apartment as well as two other teachers and 
three korean male students who took a trip to a resort area with the 
victim last weekend 
the autopsy showed the victim was not sexually abused and police 
said they found some valuables in the apartment which led them to 
believe robbery was not a motive 
ms abel came to seoul in october and was one of about 25 
englishlanguage teachers at a private school the english language 
services the school said she had worked in japan before coming to 
south korea

fiftyfour percent of israelis favor 
negotiations with the plo while 44 percent oppose such talks under 
any circumstances according to a poll published today 
the findings contrast with the policy of the new coalition 
government which flatly rules out talks with the palestine 
liberation organization israel says the plo is a terrorist 
organization 
prime minister yitzhak shamir of the rightwing likud bloc said 
in presenting the government thursday that he invited the 
leftleaning labor party to share power because israel needed to 
present a united front against the plo 
the poll was conducted tuesday and wednesday by the dahaf 
institute which interviewed 653 israeli jews the results were 
published in the yediot ahronot newspaper 
people were asked based on plo chief yasser arafats 
statement in geneva and on condition that he renounces terror are 
you for or against negotiations with the plo 
twentyone percent said they definitely backed talks while 33 
percent said they favored negotiations 
but 24 percent said they were definitely against talks while 20 
percent simply said they opposed negotiations two percent were 
undecided 
the margin of error was plus or minus 25 percent the institute 
said 
dahaf pollster mina zemach said the 54 percent approval rate was 
the highest measured by her institute 
similar surveys in the last two years found a support rate 
ranging from 48 percent to 52 percent while the number of those 
rejecting talks fluctuated between 44 percent and 47 percent she 
said 
in october one month before the israeli election 50 percent 
approved talks while 47 percent objected and 3 percent had no 
opinion ms zemach said

hostages their captors and the people of lebanon said the letter 
published in english and arabic by lebanons prestigious daily

anderson 41 of lorain ohio chief middle east correspondent 
for the associated press is the longestheld of the 15 foreign 
captives in lebanon he was kidnapped in moslem west beirut on march 
16 1985 
traditionally this is a season of hope peace and forgiveness 
but there is little hope in my heart that i will see terry and other 
hostages released during these christmas holidays the letter said 
it is difficult to sustain hope after almost four years of 
working and praying for freedom for terry and the other hostages 
some days it seems we have made no progress and are farther from our 
goal as ever 
we hear mixed messages from the middle east and we have no 
clear guidelines about what we should do or could do on behalf of 
these innocent men mrs say wrote 
addressing the kidnappers the letter said only you their 
captors can end this stalemate i pray for you to have the courage 
to bring this to a peaceful conclusion for humanitarian reasons 
mrs say concluded her letter by saying we have all suffered 
enough 
please 
may god be with you and peace be yours 
on thursday relatives and friends made radio appeals to 
kidnappers holding anderson and the eight other american hostages to 
release them in time for christmas 
the christiancontrolled voice of lebanon radio broadcast the 
appeals which included messages from former us hostages lawrence 
jenco and david jacobsen 
jacobsen and jenco were held by islamic jihad the same 
fundamentalist shiite moslem faction holding anderson and american 
educator thomas sutherland who was kidnapped june 9 1985 
in a message from sacramento calif jacobsen addressed haj the 
name by which the former american hostages knew their jailer 
jacobsen freed nov 2 1986 after being held 1 years told 
haj you have it within your power to take the first step toward 
justice and a better world for the shiite moslems you told me 
personally that you believe in peace and justice 
now you have a wonderful opportunity to demonstrate your words 
of understanding and compassion release the hostages unilaterally 
and without conditions 
haj you must have trust in the goodness of the american 
people it is worth a try 
jenco a catholic priest who was freed july 27 1986 by islamic 
jihad after 18 months in captivity told anderson and sutherland 
in 1985 we sadly celebrated midnight mass together a young 
guard brought a beautiful cake with the words happy birthday jesus 
christ it seems like yesterday 
this christmas i am free to celebrate a free christmas with my 
loved ones and yet im not free for knowing that you both are in 
prison for your fourth christmas may this christmas be the day of

a former army captain accused in 
the 1980 slaying of a roman catholic archbishop and being held in 
miami on other charges will not face extradition to el salvador the 
supreme court ruled 
the court thursday struck down a request for the united states to 
extradite alvaro saravia because it said there wasnt enough 
evidence linking him to the murder of archbishop oscar arnulfo 
romero 
the court also said attorney general giron flores did not have 
the constitutional power to ask the united states to send saravia 
back to el salvador 
flores had directly asked the united states for saravias 
extradition the case went to the supreme court after saravias 
attorney requested a hearing 
saravia has been jailed in miami since november 1987 when he was 
arrested for a traffic violation and authorities found he had been 
in the country illegally since 1985 
it was not clear if thursdays ruling could result in saravias 
release the salvadoran court said saravia would not be subject to 
arrest if he were sent home 
president jose napoleon duartes government accused saravia of 
arranging romeros assassination on orders of rightwing legislator 
roberto daubuisson who denied the allegation 
romero an outspoken critic of rightwing death squads was shot 
by a sniper while saying mass in san salvador on march 24 1980 
the governments accusations were based on the testimony of 
amadeo garay reyes who allegedly drove the sniper to the church 
the supreme court said garays testimony was not credible partly 
because he waited more than seven years to come forward with his 
story

hundreds of train cars are hauling relief supplies 
into soviet armenia daily but railway tieups are slowing urgently 
needed shipments from arriving in the earthquakedevastated region 
news reports said 
children traumatized by the dec 7 quake need psychological 
counseling and thousands of victims who lost limbs need prosthetics 
the reports continued 
officials meanwhile began planning the reconstruction of cities 
even though one report said the leveled town of spitak was going to 
be rebuilt only a halfmile from a fault line 
a commission of the ruling politburo ordered all possible 
transport mobilized to ship trailers to the disaster area for use as 
medical stations the official soviet news agency tass reported 
thursday 
the panel found rail services in particular are a bottleneck 
slowing measures to overcome the effects of the natural calamity 
tass said 
new reports said soviet authorities had evacuated 92000 people 
from northern armenia a mountainous republic bordered by turkey 
the temblor that registered 69 on the richter scale killed an 
estimated 55000 people and left 500000 homeless 
tass increased the official count of ruined villages to 300 
and said 58 of them were obliterated by the quake it also said 
about 10 percent of the livestock in the rural areas died 
freight traffic to armenia is increasing daily as building 
materials join the relief supplies pouring into the tiny republic 
but hauling cargo from the armenian capital yerevan to the city of 
leninakan and other stricken areas is still a problem tass said 
rail service near the disaster area is erratic unloading of 
freight cars is quickening but still is not fast enough even at 
1633 cars a day it said estimating at least 2000 cars must pass 
through daily to fill needs 
armenian children meanwhile took up their books again in 23 
temporary schools in the crimea hundreds of miles from their ruined 
homes tass reported 
psychologists are working with victims to ease the pain of their 
experience and warned that children especially could suffer for 
years to come according to the newspaper trud experts suggested it 
will take 15 years to psychologically rehabilitate a generation of 
armenian children the paper said 
physical rehabilitation is also looming as a massive undertaking 
thousands of people need artificial limbs and many others were 
paralyzed when they were crushed under tons of concrete according 
to richard schubert president of the american red cross quoted by 
the novosti news service 
meanwhile an article in trud on plans for reconstruction of the 
destroyed city of spitak raised as many questions as it answered 
as shown by recent events it sits on the intersection of two 
breaks in the earths crust therefore the city practically must be 
built on a new square 500 to 600 meters yards from the current 
one 
without explaining how a move of a halfmile could make much 
difference in an earthquake like that of dec 7 which destroyed 
virtually every building in the city of 25000 the newspaper said 
spitak and leninakan will be placed in fields less susceptible to 
earthquake on hard rock foundations

a decision by gov ned mcwherter that 
blocks early parole reviews for some criminals will prevent such a 
hearing for the rev martin luther king jrs assassin for 10 years 
the governor drew praise from a black political groups leader by 
amending a 1985 gubernatorial directive that calls for reviews of 
inmates for possible early release to relieve prison overcrowding 
it shows he has concern for all people regardless of race 
said james m brown chairman of the tennessee voters council it 
took guts to do it 
the mcwherter amendment outlined in a letter thursday to parole 
board chairman charles traughber excludes inmates from such an 
early review if they have been convicted of escape attempt to 
escape or assault or homicide of an inmate or prison official 
mcwherters decision would not affect assassin james earl rays 
original parole eligibility date in 1998 but removes him from 
consideration for an early release because of his escape record 
said david welles the governors legal counsel 
ray was a fugitive from a missouri prison when he killed the 
civil rights leader in memphis on april 4 1968 he is serving a 
99year term at brushy mountain state prison from which he escaped 
in june 1977 
its not just directed at mr rays situation this affects the 
certain inmates that may be up for early release because of 
overcrowding welles said 
welles said the decision would keep about 100 inmates in jail 
ray now 60 pleaded guilty to firstdegree murder in the 
assassination on march 9 1969 but retracted his story three days 
later and has continued to claim his innocence 
a 1985 directive designed to reduce prison overcrowding made ray 
eligible for a parole hearing in november but was criticized by 
black leaders including brown 
brown wrote mcwherter requesting that the hearing be prevented 
i asked him to do it before christmas and make it a present to 
all of us we didnt want a hearing at all brown said 
jim kennedy mcwherters chief of staff said the order was 
effective immediately for ray who has been turned down for early 
parole at least twice

the house of commons is headed toward a final vote 
on the free trade agreement with the united states that is scheduled 
to take effect new years day 
the uscanada free trade agreement is going to be put before 
parliament for a final decision before christmas and it is going to 
be put in place by jan 1 trade minister john crosbie said 
thursday 
crosbie made the comment as he opened debate in ottawa on the 
third and final reading for the trade agreements enabling 
legislation 
prime minister brian mulroneys progressive conservative party 
won a second consecutive majority government in nov 21 elections 
clearing the way for the trade agreement he signed with president 
reagan in january 
the party has been using its majority in the house of commons to 
speed through the passage but even the most drastic limits would 
require deputies to stay at work until about 1 am saturday 
christmas day 
some evidently homesick members sang christmas carols during 
debate that carried past midnight wednesday 
a delay of days weeks or probably even several months would not 
hinder the agreement which will phase out all remaining tariffs 
between the two countries over a 10year period 
but supporters of the agreement say it would be embarrassing for 
canada to have to ask the united states to postpone the start of 
such a major undertaking 
the approval in the house of commons then would allow the senate 
to complete its work next week the senate which is appointed has 
promised not to oppose the trade legislation 
the united states completed all its legislation for the agreement 
in september but it was delayed in canada by intense opposition 
that forced mulroney to call the election last fall 
the opposition still wants mulroney to clarify such issues as how 
much government help will be available for workers who lose their 
jobs as a result of plant closings linked to the trade agreement 
mulroneys party has 169 of the 295 seats in the house of 
commons the opposition liberal party holds 82 and the socialist new 
democratic party 43

tougher penalties for drunken driving have no 
effect on fatal auto accidents among 19 and 20yearolds but 
raising the drinking age to 21 leads to a dramatic reduction in 
deaths a study suggests 
the fatality rate in singlevehicle nighttime crashes involving 
drivers 19 and 20 years old declined 38 percent in the 28 months 
after tennessee raised its drinking age from 19 to 21 said dr 
michael decker of the vanderbilt university school of medicine 
tougher penalties for drunken driving imposed by tennessee in 
1982 did not change the nighttime fatality rate among 19 and 20 
year olds said decker whose study appears in todays journal of 
the american medical association 
the threat of penalty in and of itself is not enough to solve 
the problem of drunken driving he said the true risk of 
being apprehended is so small that however draconian the penalties 
are its not worth worrying about getting caught 
in another jama report today two studies found that requiring 
the use of seat belts signficantly reduced injuries and deaths and 
that accident victims who do not wear the seat belts pay nearly 
triple the health care bills of those who do 
those studies examined accidents in north carolina from 1981 to 
1983 and accident victims taken to the trauma units of four 
chicagoarea hospitals 
the tennessee study examined statistics on drivers ages 15 to 24 
in 1980 through 1986 said decker an assistant professor of 
preventive medicine 
theres absolutely no reason to think the results would be 
substantially different in other states particularly now that 
theres some uniformity in the state drinking age laws he said 
wednesday 
motor vehicle accidents cause almost 40 percent of deaths among 
youths 15 to 24 and drunken driving is involved about half the 
time the study said 
drinking ages varied across the country until congress passed a 
law in 1984 requiring states to raise the limit to 21 or lose 
highway funds wyoming was the last state to comply raising its 
drinking age as of july 1 
tennessees drinking age was 21 until 1971 when it was reduced 
to 18 the limit was raised to 19 in 1979 and 21 on aug 1 1984 
although people who were 19 by that date retained the right to drink 
as the law was phased in over two years 
in the 28 months after the drinking age was raised to 21 the 
singlevehicle nighttime fatality rate among 19 and 20yearold was 
148 per 100 million miles driven a 38 percent decline from the 
rate of 237 per 100 million vehicle miles during the preceding 55 
months the study said it did not give exact numbers 
the study showed little change in the fatality rate among people 
21 to 24 whose right to drink was unaffected by the change in the 
drinking age decker said

cards for an ill child are arriving by 
the tens of thousands at the home of a woman who has been so 
inundated by the mail that she says she no longer has room to 
prepare christmas dinner 
we all have to go to a restaurant for christmas i cant even 
have christmas in my own home says frances keefe founder of 
childs wish come true this cannot go on 
pleas to stop sending cards only brought more says mrs keefe 
on tuesday it was 110000 cards and 70000 more on wednesday 
nearly 1 million pieces of mail arrived over a 10day period 
prompting mrs keefe to notify postal officials that she would no 
longer accept mail for david 
mrs keefes organization tries to grant the wishes of dying 
children and she thought she was doing just that last year when she 
began a campaign to help a cancer victim shed heard of in england 
actually the boys name is mario morby he lives in steely 
england his cancer is in remission and he wants no more cards 
in september 1987 when 13yearold mario was critically ill he 
decided he wanted his name to appear in the guinness book of world 
records for receiving more postcards than anyone else 
his family made a public plea and soon more than enough cards 
were coming in theyve never stopped even after mario had more 
than enough to earn him a spot in the record book which has dropped 
the category in the 1989 edition 
despite pleas from his family that the cards be stopped an 
estimated 3 million have been mailed from around the world to 
steely near birmingham most have been placed in a warehouse by 
local postal authorities 
earlier this month mrs keefe and an organization in west palm 
beach that had pitched in to help her appealed to wellwishers to 
stop the card campaign 
after it became apparent her efforts to end the flow of cards had 
failed a threemember board of the florida childs wish come true 
advised mrs keefe to begin refusing the mail she decided wednesday 
to take that step 
the decision was tough because so many people were touched mrs 
keefe said but enough is enough

vietnams parliament adjourned its 
winter session after demanding greater reform and strongly 
criticizing the communist government for the countrys economic 
problems official reports seen today said 
the government not only accepted the criticism but president do 
muoi admitted that sluggish inconsistent perfunctory 
management had worsened the crisis official radio hanoi said 
few countries in the world have followed in our countrys 
footsteps by patterning their 1988 scientifictechnical norms after 
those backward trends set some 15 to 20 years ago he said 
the 10day session adjourned thursday after passing 10 
resolutions including resolutions on making changes and amendments 
to the constitution radio hanoi said a text of the broadcast did 
not specify what changes and amendments were sought 
in a closing speech assembly chairman le quang dao said 1989 was 
the pivotal year for implementing economic reforms endorsed by 
the 1986 communist party congress which also ushered in more 
critical thinking and openness in most aspects of vietnamese 
life the westernstyle reforms are aimed at boosting production 
through decentralization of management and other measures 
however our country is facing great ordeals which require the 
national assembly the council of ministers central government 
and all the people to renovate even more profoundly and 
vigorously he said 
the vietnam news agency called the session the liveliest in the 
life of this countrys legislative body 
many deputies were strongly critical of the council of 
ministers weaknesses and mistakes in handling the economy and 
managing society it said in a report monday 
they demanded more economic autonomy for local areas and 
reductions of agricultural taxes they said were hindering 
production last week minister of finance hoang qui admitted before 
the parliament that the tax system has to be completely revamped 
in wednesdays session do muoi conceded the governments 
mismanagement in a speech and said i admit these shortcomings 
before the national assembly and promise to draw experience from 
them 
he acknowledged that in per capita income terms vietnam is 
ranked one of the poorest nations on earth 
do muoi said government spending has far exceeded national income 
and has even consumed our national capital and loans from foreign 
countries and does not show any signs of improvement

since philosopher leszek kolakowski broke 
his 20year exile to visit his homeland he has been toasted by the 
opposition and ignored by the communist party to which he once 
belonged 
hundreds of colleagues friends and students too young to have 
heard the young kolakowski openly criticize polish authorities have 
been filling auditoriums for the socalled kolakowski festival 
that began monday 
the lectures are the first in poland by the 61yearold 
kolakowski since he was expelled from warsaw university in 1968 
kolakowskis works are published in poland only by the underground 
press 
based at oxford university in england kolakowski has become one 
of the worlds leading philosophers winning fame for his 
threevolume history of marxist thought which focuses on what 
the author calls discrepancies between dogma and practice in 
communist countries 
the lectures have become a kolakowski festival and an 
important one for us said jerzy turowicz editor of the 
influential catholic weekly tygodnik powszechny in krakow 
about 500 students academics and leading members of the polish 
opposition squeezed together on the dark wooden benches of the main 
auditorium at warsaw university on monday to hear kolakowskis first 
lecture 
they gave kolakowski a twominute standing ovation when he stood 
up to speak 
kolakowski told the audience that when he left poland in 1968 
three secret police cars accompanied him to the airport while on 
this trip they havent paid him any attention 
on wednesday at an evening sponsored by the warsaw branch of the 
club of the catholic intelligentsia in the basement of a warsaw 
church kolakowski easily answered questions on the existence of 
devils and mystics and the link between philosophy and religion 
but when a question about the future of the banned trade union 
movement solidarity was raised kolakowski hesitated i have no 
recipe nothing is guaranteed he said 
polands communist party this year admitted wrongdoing in its 
purge of intellectuals and jews in 1968 and made clear that the 
flood of scholars who left the country then were welcome to return 
the granting of a visa to kolakowski visiting as a guest of the 
polish philosophical society is the most dramatic acceptance to 
date of that invitation kolakowski is expected to stay in poland 
about three weeks 
kolakowski began his academic career as a party member in the 
early 1950s but quickly clashed with orthodox communist ideologues 
in 1956 during a political thaw after stalins death known as 
the polish october kolakowski and a small group of communist 
intellectuals started straight talk a lively journal of critical 
marxist theory 
the young philosopher urged the party to strive for integral 
democracy for that view the party leadership branded kolakowski 
a revisionist and straight talk survived only a year before 
authorities banned it 
a 1966 university lecture on the polish october in which 
kolakowski accused authorities of breaking promises to the polish 
people cost the professor his party card 
the final blow to kolakowskis academic career came when the 
minister of education revoked his chair after the philosopher 
defended students who had participated in march 1968 unrest 
kolakowski soon left poland and joined other soviet bloc 
philosophers bloc forced into exile for their views including georg 
lukacs of hungary deported to romania in 1956 and ernst bloch who 
lost his chair at the university of leipzig in east germany in 1957 
he taught at universities in canada and the united states and 
finally settled at oxford university

finnish police said today they have 
questioned an arab resident in connection with a telephoned bomb 
warning to the us embassy against an american airliner 
though some details of the warning appeared to fit the crash 
wednesday of a pan am jumbo jet in scotland police said they found 
no proof of a link between the warning and the tragedy that killed 
all 258 people on board and 22 people in lockerbie 
seppo tiitinen chief of the security police said the call was a 
message of warning rather than a threat 
the us embassy was warned dec 5 that an arab residing in 
finland would plant a bomb aboard an american airliner originating 
from frankfurt west germany within a couple of weeks he said 
pan am flight 103 originated in frankfurt as a boeing 727 and 
continued from london as a boeing 747 
the caller who spoke english with an arabic accent said the 
bomb would be carried aboard the aircraft by a finnish woman but it 
was not clear if she would be a willing accomplice tiitinen told 
the associated press 
the same caller had issued bomb warnings to the israeli and us 
embassies earlier this year each time naming the wouldbe bomber 
tiitinen said the caller said the abu nidal group an extremist 
palestinian organization was behind the plan 
tiitinen said the identity of the caller was not certain but 
officers had spoken to the man that the caller accused of preparing 
the bomb 
its a man who has been living in finland for some time and is 
married to a finnish woman he said he declined to identify him 
by name but said he had no record of trouble with the police 
we have questioned this man both in connection with earlier 
threats and now after the crash in scotland but so far we have no 
reason to believe that he has anything to do with threats or the 
accident tiitinen said 
he said police thought the calls were connected to a personal 
feud between the two men we think its more a case of personal 
relationships than anything else tiitinen said 
but he denied the warnings were dismissed all messages have 
been taken very seriously he said 
tiitinen said the phone warnings began in the first half of this 
year to the israeli embassy and were similarly worded he declined 
to say how many times the embassies were called 
israeli embassy spokesman ehud eytam said a check of the 
embassys records the last four months showed no evidence of 
telephoned threats 
the us embassy referred callers to the state department in 
washington 
undersecretary of state ronald spiers said in washington that the 
federal aviation administration issued an alert after a bomb threat 
was received by the helsinki embassy dec 5

a newspaper today quoted a security source as 
saying investigators were taking very seriously a proiranian 
groups claim that it was responsible for the crash of a pan am 
jetliner in scotland 
the independent quoted the senior british security source as 
saying the group is thought to have sought revenge for the july 3 
downing of an iranian jetliner by a us warship in the persian gulf 
an anonymous caller to the associated press in london claimed 
thursday the guardians of the islamic revolution were responsible 
for wednesdays crash of pan am flight 103 which killed all 258 on 
board and 22 people on the ground 
irans foreign ministry today said the claim was a crude 
propaganda ploy designed to discredit iran and it denied 
involvement in the crash 
the official islamic republic news agency monitored in nicosia 
quoted an unidentified ministry spokesman as saying in tehran the 
scheme seems to be deliberately designed by foreign enemies of iran 
for specific purposes 
the independent quoted the unnamed source as identifying the 
group as a fundamentalist moslem group of lebanonbased islamic 
jihad fanatics 
investigators also focused on precrash threats of a terrorist 
strike 
in washington us officials said an anonymous caller to the 
us embassy in helsinki finland said dec 5 that a bomb would be 
planted aboard a pan am flight from frankfurt west germany to the 
united states within two weeks 
george churchillcoleman head of scotland yards antiterrorist 
branch opened an investigation thursday of the london stopover of 
flight 103 which originated in frankfurt and was bound for new york 
the sabotage theory focused on transfer of luggage between the 
boeing 727 that flew the frankfurtlondon leg and the boeing 747 
that took off for new york 
government and industry officials said it seemed clear the boeing 
747 broke apart in flight strewing blazing wreckage over the 
scottish village of lockerbie and surrounding hills 
such a sudden catastrophe would be consistent with flight 
controller reports that the cockpit sent no distress call as the 
plane having reached cruising altitude of 31000 feet disappeared 
from radar 
the times of london said the air accident investigation branch of 
britains transport department was examining wreckage under 
microscopes to measure the depth of indentations 
it said years of research showed that if a bomb is detonated in 
an aircraft fragments smash into their surroundings with 10 times 
more force than if the plane is downed for some other reason 
it said investigators were also looking for minute traces of 
burns or of explosive itself on seats and victims 
it is in many ways like a criminal investigation lockerbie 
police superintendent angus kennedy told reporters you have to 
preserve the scene we have to photograph bodies and bits and 
pieces it is a very long and very painstaking task 
other news reports quoted investigators as saying that the fact a 
few pieces of wreckage were found up to 80 miles from lockerbie 
suggested the plane had been blown apart by a powerful bomb

algerians reelected chadli bendjedid to 
his third presidential term by a smaller margin than ever before 
but still gave him a mandate to continue reforms that began two 
months ago 
thg interior ministry announced early today that bendjedid the 
single candidate had captured 81 percent of thursdays vote 
about 89 percent of the countrys 12 million eligible voters cast 
ballots voter turnout in algeria traditionally runs at about 90 
percent 
as in most oneparty states where a single candidate is on the 
ballot voter abstention is seen as the only real form of dissent in 
elections 
although still winning a high percentage of votes the win was 14 
percent smaller than 1984 when bendjedid garnered 95 percent of the 
vote with voter turnout at about 95 percent in 1979 he took 94 
percent 
while reflecting a decline in popularity the election still 
gives bendjedid a clear mandate to continue with the economic 
reforms introduced after a week of rioting in early october that 
claimed 176 lives 
rioters filled the streets to protest high unemployment 
inflation and a chronic housing shortage in an effort to restore 
calm bendjedid promised a more liberal political system and less 
central control of both the economy and society 
in his third term bendjedid faces the task of reducing the power 
of a military and civilian bureaucracy that has built a comfortable 
position in the 25 years since independence from france 
he also has promised to loosen the grip of the national 
liberation front the only legal political party on all aspects of 
algerian life one problem is how to permit more autonomy and 
democratic freedom without allowing opposition parties 
the severe economic problems remain many traceable to several 
years of low oil prices on world markets unemployment and annual 
inflation have surpassed 20 percent and the foreign debt is 23 
billion

the savannah river plants reactors which 
have been shut down by safety concerns could be restarted 
immediately if the nations defense demanded more nuclear weapons 
material the complexs manager said 
but plant manager john t lowe declined to say when he thought 
the plant in south carolina nearly 20 miles southeast of here would 
be restarted 
i think that remains to be defined lowe said in interviews 
published today in the augusta chronicle and the augusta herald 
there has been speculation that it would be six months or 12 
months i really think until the criteria are well defined 
its sheer speculation to pick a date 
i certainly think they the reactors can be restarted safely 
i think if the nation judged there was a need for the materials 
they could be restarted today 
lowe was interviewed thursday on the same day us energy 
secretary john herrington announced that ultrasonic testing would be 
used to check for possible cracks in reactor vessels that could 
delay srps restart until next summer 
all three savannah river reactors have been shut down since 
summer for safety upgrades and maintenance the shutdown is one of a 
number of problems plaguing the nations nuclear weapons production 
system including plants in fernald ohio and rocky flats colo 
some have expressed concern the shutdown at savannah river could 
harm the nations defense because the complex is americas only 
producer of tritium an isotope of hydrogen which is a critical 
element in hydrogen bombs and which deteriorates at the rate of 55 
percent a year 
lowe contended that the plant is safe to operate now and said 
the us department of energy wants to increase the complexs 
margin of safety the reactors have run safely for 35 years 
meeting the nations needs said lowe whose employer du pont 
runs the plant for doe theyve run without a nuclear incident 
that was an injury to anybody either on or off the plant and 
theyve been continuously upgraded over that time 
lowe said politics have played a role in the debate over the 
plants safety plant officials were criticized in congressional 
hearings earlier this year for not adequately reporting past safety 
problems 
certainly if you go back in time from 1950 to this year we 
have not only provided doe with notification of what we considered 
significant events but also a wrapup of what it meant lowe 
countered 
but with all the current attention there is an increasing 
emphasis from the doe to know things sooner and at a greater level 
of detail and so were working to develop a system and have that 
available to them 
some of its clearly congressional pressure 
du pont is wrapping up its involvement with the plant which 
dates back to the plants construction in the 1950s westinghouse is 
scheduled to take over operations of the facility april 1

an apology from a judge who said he gave a killer a 
lenient sentence because the victims were queers did little to 
ease the demands of gay rights activists and others who want him 
removed from the bench 
he has cast a reasonable doubt into the minds of people across 
this nation about dallas justice said william waybourn president 
of the dallas gay alliance 
he has raised the question of his judicial fitness and ability 
to be impartial this question cannot be answered with a simple 
apology 
state district judge jack hampton apologized on thursday for a 
poor choice of words 
hampton told the dallas times herald last week that he sentenced 
richard lee bednarski 18 to 30 years in prison instead of life on 
nov 28 in part because the two victims were homosexuals who 
wouldnt have been killed if they hadnt been cruising the streets 
picking up teenage boys 
i dont much care for queers cruising the streets picking up 
teenage boys ive got a teenage boy the judge told the 
newspaper 
hamptons statements outraged the gay community which filed a 
complaint with the texas commission on judicial conduct that could 
lead to his removal 
elected officials including state treasurer ann richards and 
us sen edward kennedy dmass also criticized hampton as did 
church leaders some with large gay congregations who asked him to 
repudiate the statements 
the judges apology was addressed to the ministers 
i did not mean to condemn the homosexual community generally 
and i used a poor choice of words and im sorry about that 
hampton said he said he did not intend to state that any victim 
of crime was entitled to less fair treatment 
the judge said thursday he considered a variety of factors in 
sentencing bednarski including the defendants age his lack of a 
criminal record and what the victims were doing out there but not 
their lifestyle 
hampton is up for reelection in 1990 
his apology to eight citizens is not enough his apology to 
every citizen is not enough waybourn said bednarski the 
executormurderer cannot get off by apologizing neither can judge 
hampton 
about 50 signcarrying demonstrators gathered in support of 
hampton outside the courthouse 
i think that is very generous of judge hampton i think that 
merely shows how fair he is attorney bill mcknight said of the 
apology i do not know who bestowed sacred cow status on the 
homosexuals of this community i dont think they deserve it

a palestinian leader said the yearlong uprising 
against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip should be 
escalated with military action 
salim zaanoun deputy speaker of the palestine national council 
the plos parliamentinexile suggested thursday night that the 
uprising take serious action to launch military operations here 
and there 
he differentiated between military action and terrorism saying 
military action is sanctioned by international law as long as our 
land is occupied 
zaanoun was addressing a rally at the palestine liberation 
organization office in kuwait to mark the 21st anniversary of the 
popular front for the liberation of palestine a leftist guerrilla 
group led by george habash 
the popular front is united with yasser arafats mainstream fatah 
and other groups under the plo umbrella 
zaanoun cautioned against expecting too much from the recently 
initiated plous dialogue 
the united states has lost too much and wants to compensate for 
this loss by this theatrical piece he said 
we have to pursue an evenhanded approach to avoid expecting 
too much from the diplomatic moves and devote part of our effort for 
struggle and perpetuation of the momentum of the uprising 
he said the uprising should continue and become more vigorous 
kuwaits alqabas daily quoted arafat the plo chairman as 
ruling out acceptance of anywhere but jerusalem as capital of the 
palestinian state 
a palestinian state with holy jerusalem as its capital is our 
demand to which we will stick he was quoted as saying in an 
interview 
he also rejected the notion of demilitarizing the palestinian 
state unless israel is disarmed the newspaper said 
we should be equal he was quoted as saying we want a 
completely sovereign state why should the palestinians abandon part 
of their sovereignty and israel not be asked to do so 
the united states initiated dialogue with the plo after arafat 
explicitly recognized israels right to exist and renounced 
terrorism arafat said he had not succumbed to us conditions 
so the talks could start 
i did not change my policy it was the united states which 
changed its policy he said 
asked what prompted the us government to change its stand 
arafat said undoubtedly it was the attitude of 154 member states 
of the united nations who decided to shift the venue of the un 
general assembly debate on the palestinian question to geneva 
this move was taken after washington denied arafat a visa thus 
barring him from addressing the general assembly in new york

the government talks to lech walesa and lets him go to paris 
which is very good but at the same time a huge majority of peace

his recent celebrity hunt to the needy and made the point that the 
meat was being put to good use 
to see the expression on the peoples faces is pretty 
satisfying said russell who held a hunt that drew 32 athletes 
actors and popular musicians as well as the ire of animal rights 
activists 
wearing a flannel shirt and blue jeans he dished out venison 
stew thursday to hundreds of homeless and needy people at the 
salvation armys champa street center 
russell donated 500 pounds of the big game meat to the salvation 
army in denver and 500 pounds to the rescue mission in grand 
junction in western colorado he planned to go to grand junction to 
participate in the meal for the homeless there today 
russell who lives part of the year in the colorado rockies said 
he wanted the hunt to show the reason that you take game is for 
providing either for yourself or your family or in this case for 
other people to get the message out to other hunters that we are 
able to maybe take some of our game and donate it to people who 
really need it 
nonetheless his hunt troubled animal rights activists and 
triggered a dispute over hunting licenses with state agencies 
animal rights activists and some hollywood celebrities took out a

divine revelation bombed a nearby mormon chapel

a police counterinsurgency unit active 
in the war against proindependence guerrillas will be disbanded as 
a goodwill gesture following the agreement to end south african rule 
over namibia a police official said today 
the unit with a reputation for tough and sometimes controversial 
tactics is known as koevoet the afrikaans word for crowbar 
chief inspector kierie du rand said the unit would be phased out 
gradually starting april 1 the beginning of a sevenmonth 
transition process leading to elections for a naimibian national 
assembly 
koevoet members have been involved in numerous court cases over 
the years related to allegations of brutality against black 
civilians in the northern war zone authorities have declined to 
disclose the number of men serving in the multiracial unit but 
foreign minister pik botha of south africa said thursday that 
overall police strength in namibia would be reduced from 8300 to 
7000 
botha was speaking at a news conference after joining angolan and 
cuban officials in signing agreements at the united nations to bring 
about independence in namibia and remove cuban troops from 
neighboring angola 
koevoet played a principal role in countering incursions by 
angolabased insurgents of the southwest african peoples 
organization which began a bush war against south african rule in 
1966 
swapo is favored to win the nov 1 elections but it is likely to 
be opposed by a multiracial coalition of parties participating in 
the current south africaninstalled transitional government 
dirk mudge a white moderate who serves on the transitional 
cabinet today urged an active campaign to ensure that political 
power remains in responsible hands he said there should be no 
turning back from the united nations independence plan known as 
resolution 435 
in spite of all the risks that may be involved in the 
implementation of resolution 435 the failure of the peace effort 
will have serious even disastrous consequences that may include 
military confrontation he said 
south africas defense minister gen magnus malan told 
reporters in new york that south africa under the agreement signed 
thursday would halt military assistance to unita the prowestern 
rebel movement fighting angolas marxist government 
however malan said south africa would maintain a friendly 
relationship with unita and also expected angola to close african 
national congress guerrilla bases on its territory the anc wages a 
bombing and sabotage campaign in south africa aimed at undermining 
the whitecontrolled government 
should the cubans launch a new offensive against unita south 
africa would not sit back with folded arms malan said 
swapo in a statement issued in luanda angola and reported by 
the mozambican news agency aim hailed thursdays agreement as a 
milestone but criticized proposals by western countries to reduce by 
more than half the planned 7500member un monitoring force for 
namibia 
swapo said the smaller force would be unable to monitor the 
movements of south african military and police units including 
koevoet which is described as internationally famed for its 
atrocities 
swapo said south africa would try to use these security forces 
to create a climate of intimidation and insecurity and thereby to 
influence the outcome of the namibian independence elections in 
favor of its surrogates

a consumer boycott launched by 
blacks to protest the revival of municipal segregation laws caused 
huge christmasseason losses for merchants in boksburg a local 
business leader said today 
johan viljoen chairman of the boksburg chamber of commerce 
estimated that shopowners lost more than 420000 during a fourweek 
boycott protesting the reinstatement of whites only status at 
parks and other public facilities 
many businesses in the industrial town east of johannesburg would 
be unable to recover their losses and some were likely to close 
soon viljoen said in a telephone interview sales at some clothing 
and furniture stores were down by as much as 80 percent he said 
the resegregation campaign was undertaken by town council members 
of the farright conservative party who gained power in boksburg 
and dozens of other municipalities in oct 26 election 
residents of black and mixedrace communities neighboring 
boksburg who outnumber the 85000 white residents by more than 
3to1 said they would grant the town council its wish for a 
white christmas by staying out of the central business district 
on thursday developers of a 11 million shopping mall planned 
for boksburg announced the project was shelved because of the citys 
bad business climate 
the major tenant would have been the ok bazaar retail company 
its chief executive gordon hood said business at his companys 
existing store in boksburg had declined by 49 percent in the past 
month 
a week ago developers of another proposed shopping mall for 
boksburg announced that their plans were being shelved until 
conditions in the town return to normal 
the boksburg council thus far has refused to back down despite 
intense criticism from the government and local business groups 
the conservatives have accused the government of hypocrisy and 
challenged president pw bothas national party to repeal the 
separate amenities act which allows local officials to segregate 
public amenities the government thus far has made no move to repeal 
the law and has not pushed for integration of whitesonly facilities 
in towns controlled by national party councils 
the whole thing has been ripped out of proportion by the 
misinformation campaign of the media said a conservative party 
leader koos van der merwe 
our promises were made within the separate amenities act and 
the voters knew what they were voting for

seat belt laws dramatically reduce serious 
injuries and deaths and accident victims who didnt buckle up had 
medical bills three times higher than those who did researchers 
reported today 
the two studies which examined traffic accidents in chicago and 
north carolina were published in the journal of the american 
medical association 
in the north carolina study of nearly 100000 people involved in 
accidents from 1983 to 1987 researchers found that after seat belt 
legislation was enacted and especially after fines were imposed 
the number of deaths or serious injuries dropped dramatically 
the second study examined 1364 accident victims taken to trauma 
units of four chicagoarea hospitals when the victims wore safety 
belts hospital admissions decreased nearly 65 percent and related 
costs dropped 66 percent 
safety belts turn out to be an economical way of trying to 
reduce that health care dollar said dr elizabeth orsay of the 
university of illinoischicago she was primary author of the cost 
study 
thirtyone states and the district of columbia have seat belt 
laws 
the north carolina study estimated that the state may have 1100 
fewer severe and fatal highway injuries each year as a result of 
mandatory seat belt use 
what the study suggests is that each and every state could 
benefit from seat belt laws with primary enforcement said dr 
donald reinfurt of the university of north carolina chapel hill a 
coauthor of the study 
primary enforcement part of north carolinas law means police 
may stop a vehicle if the occupants arent wearing seat belts other 
states with primary enforcement laws include connecticut hawaii 
iowa new york new mexico and texas 
north carolina passed a law requiring seat belt use by frontseat 
occupants in 1985 and began imposing a 25 fine in 1987 the year a 
second study by the university found the state had the highest rate 
of seat belt use in the country 
while the number of frontseat passengers in traffic accidents 
rose from 1983 through 1987 the percentage of serious or fatal 
injuries dropped significantly after the law was passed and again 
when the fines were imposed 
in 1985 47 percent of 19385 frontseat passengers involved in 
accidents died or suffered severe injuries in 1986 the figure was 
44 percent of 20603 in 1987 it was 38 percent of 21752 victims 
the chicago study showed that the average cost of treating 
accident victims who were wearing seat belts was 534 against 1583 
for those who didnt buckle up 
mandatory seat belt use would significantly decrease the 
financial burden on the public ms orsay said 
we looked at who was paying for these costs and a majority of 
people not wearing safety belts either had no insurance or were on 
public assistance of some sort she said

arizonas death penalty law is 
unconstitutional a federal appeals court ruled giving new hope to 
about 85 condemned prisoners 
the 74 ruling thursday by the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
reversed a death sentence in the 1976 carbombing murder of a 
phoenix newspaper reporter 
the ruling found that the death penalty law violated the right to 
a jury trial by letting the trial judge decide whether a murder was 
a capital crime the court also said the law improperly required the 
defendant to justify leniency and did not allow consideration of all 
pertinent evidence favoring leniency 
if it stands the ruling would overturn all death sentences 
issued in arizona since the law was passed in 1973 
in a separate 65 vote the court ruled that even if the law had 
been valid john adamsons death sentence was improper because the 
sentencing judge had previously ruled that a prison sentence was 
appropriate for the murder and imposed a death sentence only after 
adamson violated a plea agreement requiring him to testify against 
two other men 
it was the second time the court overturned the death sentence of 
adamson who admitted planting the bomb in june 1976 that killed don 
bolles an investigative reporter for the arizona republic the 
supreme court reversed the first ruling and reinstated adamsons 
death sentence last year 
arizona attorney general bob corbin said he would appeal 
adamsons case to the high court and denounced the appeals court 
you cannot get a death penalty case through the 9th circuit 
court of appeals because the majority of the judges are 
antideath penalty corbin said 
timothy foley one of adamsons lawyers said the ruling affirms 
the right to have a jury decide a defendants fate rather than a 
judge whos subject to retention elections and political pressure

a crack cocaine addict was so desperate to be 
treated for his drug dependency that he smashed the windows at two 
police stations to draw attention to himself officials say 
this case smacks you in the face because here is a guy who 
obviously wanted to be helped said criminal court judge john 
moore who helped the addict alexis vega 34 to get treatment 
this case dramatizes the critical need for treatment upon 
demand for all individuals addicted to drugs said bronx district 
attorney paul gentile 
vegas efforts to find treatment began after his wife and 
8monthold son left him last summer according to accounts today in 
the new york post and the new york times 
first he visited hospitals and treatment centers but was told 
there was no room 
gentile and police confirmed that on one occasion the man spoke 
to the desk sergeant at a station house in the williamsbridge 
section of the bronx 
i told him i had a problem and was seeking some help vega 
said i could see they werent going to arrest me or help so i 
reached into my pockets and pulled out some stuff and put it on the 
desk right in front of them 
a hypodermic needle and two empty crack vials was enough to shock 
the officers he said 
they grabbed me roughed me up a little put the handcuffs on a 
little too tight the usual stuff vega said 
but when he was brought before a judge on misdemeanor charges he 
was freed and his pleas to be enrolled in a treatment program were 
ignored he said 
finally breaking the windows at two police stations got him 
thrown into jail into moores courtroom and finally into a 
treatment program after the judge made a call on his behalf 
luis sierra a staff member for the centers operator the way 
out church ministries inc said vega had lucked out 
we have a capacity of 58 men and a waiting list of 600 and 
there was one vacancy left when the judge called me he said

an agency is spending 70000 on awnings flags 
and other improvements to dress up dilapidated buildings for 
convention visitors but neighborhood leaders say the city should 
worry more about substance than image 
the downtown development authority funded by the city and 
special taxes on businesses is paying for the cosmetic changes to 
three buildings prior to the north american international auto show 
in early january 
you always open yourself up to criticism because if these 
buildings were viable and occupied this wouldnt be necessary 
said alex pollock a city planner who worked on the trimmings but 
if the city is going to hope to get this auto show repeated we 
have to make a sincere effort to correct some of the less 
presentable parts of downtown 
the abandoned tuller and heritage hotels and detroit metropolitan 
building near detroits grand circus park echo better days with new 
awnings over blank windows spruced up entrance canopies paint 
jobs flags and banners the new fixings will not be taken down 
after the convention 
neighborhood leaders say the money could be better spent 
all that glitters isnt gold said cheryl allen an officer 
of the michigan avenue community organization that 70000 used 
in our neighborhood would probably rehabilitate five complete 
homes top to bottom then you would have five families in liveable 
homes and looking at a future here

pope john paul ii met with plo leader yasser 
arafat today for 20 minutes and expressed hope the israelis and 
palestinians would soon begin negotiations leading to peace in the 
middle east 
it was the second meeting between the pope and the palestine 
liberation organization chairman in six years 
the vatican said in a statement after the meeting the pope 
expressed his hope that both peoples israelis and palestinians 
would soon see the beginning of a real process of understanding and 
of peace which would put an end finally to their suffering and 
their fears 
the holy father reiterated that he was profoundly convinced 
that the two peoples had an identical fundamental right to their own 
homelands in which they could live in liberty dignity and security 
in harmony with the neighboring peoples 
the statement added that the pope said only a concrete effort 
and a sincere willingness to understand each other would produce 
progress on the road toward peace and justice 
vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said arafat filled in the pope 
on the latest developments in the middle east however he declined 
to provide specifics 
arafat spoke in arabic during the 20minute session in the popes 
library and was accompanied by farouk kaddoumi head of the plos 
political department and three other plo representatives 
the pope was accompanied by a translator 
reporters were not admitted 
arafat presented the pope with a wood carving of the nativity 
scene and the pope gave arafat a book about the vatican 
israel and jewish groups were angered by the popes agreement to 
meet with arafat in 1982 in an account of the meeting held in a 
small room of the paul vi auditorium the vatican said the pope 
called for a palestinian homeland respect for israels security and 
an end to terrorism 
the vatican which maintains diplomatic relations with 117 
countries does not have formal ties with israel although the pope 
has received israeli leaders the vatican says the lack of relations 
is due to israels unsettled boundaries and the problem of the 
palestinians it also does not have relations with jordan 
john paul has spoken out several times this year on the plight of 
the palestinians who have staged a violent yearlong uprising in 
israels occupied territories 
arafat is touring europe seeking support for an international 
middle east peace conference and the independent palestinian state 
proclaimed nov 15 by the plos parliamentinexile in algeria 
italy is the first nato member on arafats european itinerary 
todays audience took place after arafat met with premier ciriaco 
de mita and foreign minister giulio andreotti at the premiers 
office in downtown rome 
andreotti said the meeting confirmed the moderate line taken 
by the plo an umbrella for several palestinian groups including 
arafats fatah 
he said arafat gave a very positive evaluation of the 
dialogue that the united states and the plo initiated last week in 
tunis tunisia the us administration ended a 13year ban on 
contacts with the plo after arafat said the organization renounced 
terrorism recognized israels right to exist and accepted key un 
resolutions on the middle east peace process 
andreotti said arafat did not ask italy to recognize an 
independent palestinian state 
a communique from de mitas office said italy remains favorable 
to an international peace conference on the middle east

foreign minister moshe arens today linked the 
crash of a pan am jet in scotland to palestinian factions an 
israeli newspaper and terror experts blamed syrianbacked radical 
groups opposed to the usplo talks 
the daily englishlanguage newspaper the nation quoted 
unidentified western intelligence sources as saying the 
syrianbacked ahmed jibril group was responsible it said 
investigators believed that at least one person aboard could be 
identified as belonging to jibrils popular front for the liberation 
of palestinegeneral command group 
israeli officials bitterly opposed the us decision earlier this 
month to open a dialogue with the palestine liberation organization 
after its chief yasser arafat renounced terrorism and recognized 
israels right to exist 
on thursday a senior plo official mahmoud abbas said in cairo 
egypt that it was nonsensical to link palestinians to the crash 
in a report from london today a correspondent for israel radios 
english service said passengers aboard the pan am plane included two 
members of a secret us state department team returning from 
lebanon where they had negotiated for the release of american 
hostages 
a state department official in washington said today that two 
americans on the plane were involved in diplomatic security one at 
the us embassy in nicosia cyprus and another at the us embassy 
in beirut lebanon and two other diplomats from the beirut embassy 
the official who spoke on condition of anonymity denied that 
two of the americans had been involved in talks on american hostages 
arens interviewed in hebrew on israel radio said that based 
on our assumptions and those of our experts this is an operation 
of international terror apparently arab international terror 
arens attacked the usplo dialogue saying such steps would 
only strenghten the wave of terror and encourage terror groups and 
activities 
israel radio said two israelis died in the crash and israel had 
sent a top police official to london to assist in the investigation 
ariel merari a senior researcher in terrorism at tel aviv 
universitys jaffee center for strategic studies said the attack 
was apparently staged to block the usplo talks 
radical palestinian factions who declared arafat a traitor 
are the most likely candidates merari said in an interview 
they likely had syrian or libyan backing 
he said palestinian groups were responsible for half of the 
midair plane bombings in the last 20 years and said jibrils 
group in particular had a rich history of such attacks 
he said jibrils followers were linked to the feb 21 1970 
downing of swissair plane by a inflight explosion and on the same 
day unsuccessfully attempted to blow up an austrian airlines plane 
in 1971 and 1972 jibril guerrillas made three attempts to 
detonate a bomb in israels elal planes two in rome and one in 
london in one case the bomb was hidden in a record player 
they usually use naive carriers people who dont suspect in 
the case of jibril female tourists were befriended by jibrils men 
and asked to take a parcel to israel he said 
merari noted that a barometer bomb which is equipped with an 
altitudesensitive detonator and activated by air pressure was 
found concealed in a radio when 13 palestinians were detained in 
october during raids in west germany officials there said the 
suspects belonged to jibrils group 
the nation said that the leader of the jibril cell in west 
germany hafez kassem khalkamony told his interrogators the group 
planned attacks on civilian aircraft a similar report was carried 
by israel televisions military correspondent thursday 
the paper quoted west german intelligence sources as saying they 
believe a jibril guerrilla boarded the pan am plane in frankfurt 
it said the man board the plane with a briefcase packed with 
syriansupplied explosives that cannot be detected by routine 
security methods and fled when the flight was in transit in 
london leaving the briefcase behind 
meanwhile the head of the israeli pilots association yitzhak 
gonen said he warned the londonbased international pilots 
association in a telephone call earlier this month about a possible 
attack by radical palestinians 
i spoke with them a day after the us decision to start talks 
with arafat dec 15 and warned them that we may expect an increase 
in attacks by groups opposing these talks gonen said it was a 
general warning because i did not have any precise information

a west german official said today 
that police discovered an air pressureactivated bomb during the 
october arrests of suspected radical palestinians but he emphasized 
it was too soon to say whether there was any connection to the crash 
of a pan am jet 
its pure speculation said alexander prechtel spokesman for 
the chief federal prosecutors office the bomb is set off by a drop 
in air pressure such as those occurring in the luggage compartment 
of an airplane he said 
new yorkbound pan am flight 103 originated in frankfurt and 
landed in london where passengers changed from a boeing 727 to the 
illfated boeing 747 
wednesdays crash in scotland which killed 258 people on board 
and at least 22 people on the ground apparently occurred after the 
plane broke up for an unknown reason at an altitude of 31000 feet 
the neue presse newspaper of frankfurt reported today on alleged 
lapses in security checks at frankfurt airport the newspaper quoted 
an unidentified expert as saying its problemfree to smuggle a 
bomb on board 
if the explosives and detonator are taken on board separately 
its all childs play the newspaper quoted the expert as saying 
the paper quoted an unidentified baggage handler as saying that 
not every bag is subjected to an xray scan and that only random 
samplings are made 
wolfgang schwalm the spokesman for the airport declined comment 
on the report noting that security is handled by hesse state 
officials the associated press called the office of security chief 
horst harnstein and was told he was not available to talk 
but on thursday hans neusel the no 2 official in the federal 
interior ministry strongly defended security at frankfurt airport 
arno falk a spokesman for the federal police office in 
wiesbaden told the associated press that west german investigators 
were checking details of the crash and were in contact with 
investigators in london 
since the crash there have been growing indications the flight 
was sabotaged 
in london the independent newspaper today quoted a security 
source as saying investigators were taking very seriously a 
proiranian groups letter that it was responsible for the crash 
however prechtel brought up the issue of 13 palestinians rounded 
up in a series of raids in west germany in october three were later 
arrested while the others were set free but remain under 
investigation 
prechtel said in a telephone interview that the arrested suspects 
belonged to the popular front for the liberation of 
palestinegeneral command 
they have said they planned attacks against us interests 
prechtel said of the suspected popular front members 
the suspects allegedly set up a terrorist cell of the popular 
front in west germany authorities say the syriancontrolled 
faction is opposed to the palestine liberation organization leader 
yasser arafat and is headed by ahmad jibril a former syrian army 
captain 
prechtel said officers in the town of neuss near duesseldorf 
found in a car used by one member of the group a bomb activated by a 
drop in air pressure 
naturally you can see a connection prechtel said when asked 
whether members of the group could have been involved in the crash 
of the pan am plane they may have built several of these bombs 
he said the bomb that was discovered was hidden inside a radio 
thus making it difficult to detect

cashiered and imprisoned at an army garrison along with about 50 of 
his followers none have been brought to trial 
rico also led an uprising in april 1987 to protest the trial of 
officers for human rights abuses stemming from the repression of 
subversion under the 197683 military dictatorship 
that same concern prompted a third uprising against the civilian 
government of president raul alfonsin earlier this month

presidentelect bush has nearly completed his 
cabinet with a flurry of surprise announcements naming a black 
educator a conservationist a retiring hispanic lawmaker a state 
department official and a transit expert to key jobs 
only two cabinet positions at the departments of labor and 
energy remain unfilled 
im not sure when those announcements will be forthcoming but 
i would again say fairly soon bush said thursday after he picked 
five men for a variety of positions so far he has named 12 cabinet 
members 
craig fuller codirector of bushs transition said it was 
possible that bush might name additional people to his cabinet 
today and if not well wait until the first of the year 
fuller speaking on nbctvs today show said transition 
aides were talking to people about jobs on thursday night and again 
today besides the labor and energy departments bush is looking for 
his new drug czar fuller said 
among those mentioned as possible choices for labor secretary are 
patricia diaz dennis a federal communications commissioner and 
constance horner head of the office of personnel management 
in the running for the energy slot are former louisiana rep 
henson moore and peter johnson former head of the bonneville power 
administration 
bush will be working in his office today but he has no public 
schedule he plans to spend the christmas weekend with his family at 
the vice presidents house before leaving monday on a fourday 
hunting and fishing trip to texas and alabama 
two of bushs cabinet choices dr louis sullivan as secretary of 
health and human services and samuel skinner as head of the 
transportation department were expected in advance 
sullivan 55 the president of morehouse school of medicine and 
the first black chosen for the cabinet publicly reassured 
antiabortion activists that he opposes abortions except in cases of 
rape incest or when the life of the mother is threatened he said 
his views run parallel to bushs on the issue 
sullivans appointment ran into a roadblock earlier in the week 
after he was quoted in a newspaper article saying he supported a 
womans right to have an abortion 
on thursday bush praised sullivans long and extremely 
distinguished career 
skinner 50 a former prosecutor and head of the regional 
transportation authority of northeastern illinois the second 
largest transportation system in the nation had been expected to 
get the bush administration job 
bush described skinner as an effective and visionary 
transportation leader 
the presidentelect made three unexpected announcements picking 
retiring rep manuel lujan rnm to head the interior department 
former illinois rep edward j derwinski for veterans affairs and 
conservationist william reilly as administrator of the environmental 
protection agency 
the epa does not have cabinet status though bush said reillys 
mission is one of tremendous importance and he added i 
expect to be a very active president in protecting the environment 
the selection of reilly 48 a native of decatur ill who is 
president of the conservation foundation and the us affiliate of 
the world wildlife fund was cheered by environmentalists a 
brilliant choice said paul pritchard president of the national 
parks and conservation association 
reilly a harvardtrained lawyer said he thought he was the 
first conservationist selected for the epa post 
former colleagues of derwinskis said they were surprised by 
bushs pick but thought the undersecretary of state for security 
assistance science and technology would do a good job at the new 
department of veterans affairs 
his name had never even surfaced said rep g v montgomery 
dmiss chairman of the house veterans affairs committee 
derwinski 62 a world war ii veteran knew bush when the two 
served in the house in the early 1970s he lost his seat after 
redistricting in 1982 and since then he has held a variety of jobs 
at the state department 
another unexpected move came when bush selected lujan 60 for 
interior secretary a veteran of two decades in congress lujan is 
the second hispanic in the cabinet joining education secretary 
lauro cavazos of texas 
lujan who did not seek reelection was a member of the house 
interior committee and ranking republican on the house committee on 
science and technology 
meantime transition aides refused to comment on a report in the 
washington times that bush has picked bruce gelb an executive of 
bristol myer co as head of the us information agency 
in a questionandanswer session with reporters bush was asked 
about a state department statement that us embassies had been 
informed of a terrorist threat against pan am more than two weeks 
before a pan am plane en route to new york crashed in scotland on 
wednesday 
bush said most threats never materialize but if there were 
hard evidence that a specific flight was going to be threatened or 
that the threat could not be contained clearly you would want to 
serve the public good by notifying people 
on anther topic bush was asked whether he would consider 
military action to destroy a libyan chemical weapon factory an 
option that reagan in a television interview had suggested was under 
consideration he said he would work with us allies to see that 
the plant was not built but he refused to be specific

christmas eve will be silent night 
for almost 800 pirate radio stations slated to shut down 
indefinitely as part of a government plan to restructure 
broadcasting 
the centerright social democrat government has ordered the 
saturday closure while it evaluates offers from stations for control 
of 430 frequencies that will be available for local broadcast in 
1989 
final offers have to be submitted by jan 3 but the problem is 
the government hasnt said how long stations will be closed for 
said emidio rangel director of tsf a major commercial station that 
will close one day before the deadline to allow its employees to 
spend christmas with their families 
rangel said between 2000 and 3000 people could lose their jobs 
because of the closure 
pirate stations began broadcasting on the fm band in 1977 but 
with names like radio unforeseen and radio chaos most were amateur 
successive governments tolerated the pirates and the unregulated 
stations boomed 
tsf portugals most popular station among listeners in the 2545 
age group boasted a closing program friday with live interviews 
with president mario soares marathon star rosa mota and leading 
politicians 
the station set up in february this year with a capital of 
690000 has no plans to lay off its 75strong staff said tsf 
journalist luis marinho 
prime minister anibal cavaco silva is committed longterm to 
liberalizing the state national broadcasting monopoly but the 
government plans to hand over only one frequency to a national 
commercial network at a future date 
the government has been criticized for reallocating the local 
stations while leaving state and churchcontrolled national 
networks intact

legislators gave final approval friday to a law 
intended to track and prevent the spread of aids 
the law to take effect next year would require doctors to 
report to local governors the name age and sex of any aids patient 
and how the victim contracted the disease said an official at the 
research office of the standing committee on social and labor 
affairs a government agency 
the law also authorize governors to fine anyone refusing to be 
tested for aids up to 800 and to punish doctors who disclose 
information about aids patients to anyone but the governors office 
said the official speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said the law provides for banning entry to any foreigner 
believed likely to engage in activities that could spread acquired 
immune deficience syndrome although aids tests are not mandatory 
for foreigners 
most opposition members voted against the bill saying it would 
lead to people avoiding seeing their doctors 
the government says 50 people have died of aids in japan as of 
aug 31 with 90 confirmed aids patients and 1048 known carriers of 
the virus

colored lights and tinsel add a twinkle to 
the drab store windows but holiday shoppers spirits often sink 
once they scour aisles of shoddy goods and gasp at the prices 
for many poles this years christmas rush through rainy streets 
under leaden skies caps a year of economic and political discontent 
constant price increases and inflation have eroded the value of 
the zloty and shortages send shoppers scampering to better stocked 
stores in nearby czechoslovakia and east germany 
the authorities have tried to stock the markets before the 
threeday christmas holiday that starts with wigilia or 
vigil the traditional 12dish meatless meal that begins when 
the first star appears on the evening of dec 24 
thousands of people crowded the cavernous hall at warsaws hala 
mirowska market friday amid piles of oranges nuts and prunes 
outside trucks unloaded christmas trees and farmers sold spruce 
garlands from the country 
at one meat counter four saleswomen chatted as about 50 
customers in line ignored old sausages hanging on hooks and waited 
for the next meat delivery in hopes of obtaining hams or smoked pork 
the situation in the stores is very bad especially meat 
said zdzislaw kilinski a private businessman soon the government 
will end meat ration coupons prices will be higher and i think 
they are saving the meat until then 
in general customers complained about the lack of good quality 
tvs radios and clothes in state stores and said they couldnt 
afford prices in private shops 
one effort at a major warsaw department store to provide a better 
selection of goods frustrated and angered some shoppers because it 
accepted only western hardcurrency and police had to cordon off 
one newly opened wellstocked store in a provincial city to prevent 
a nearriot by the heavy flow of customers 
shoppers at the threestory junior department store in downtown 
warsaw enter another world when the escalator stops at the second 
floor 
under bright fluorescent lights the shelves are laden with 
brandname western household appliances ski boots and fashionable 
evening clothes 
but because all items in the staterun store are priced in 
dollars and must be paid for in hard currency many poles will still 
have to buy the shabby stitchings one floor down 
the shortage in normal stores of good toys pretty clothes and 
fragrant scents has led more than 5000 customers to part with their 
precious dollars since the floor opened for business on monday said 
the floor manager mariusz dobrzynski 
long lines have also formed at the pewex and baltona dollar 
stores for champagne wine and vodka the biggest lines were for 
games and toys from the west tennis rackets erector sets and dolls 
in the city of bielskobiala police were called in to restore 
order after an avalanche of customers tried to pour through the 
doors of the newly opened klimczok department store the staterun 
news agency pap reported 
the department store in the polands southern highlands is being 
hailed as the countrys biggest when it opened last week a 
nearriot erupted and polish tv showed scenes of one shopper who got 
a bloody nose in the tumult others were shown being carried out 
after apparently fainting 
the official pap news agency complained that professional buyers 
were scarfing up anying on the shelves and the goods appeared the 
next day at inflated prices on the bielskobiala flea market 
another shopping store in lodz in central poland was serving 
200000 customers a day and taking in the equivalent of 340000 
daily 
the christmas bying season was seen by the new government of 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski as a test of its ability to 
improve public moods 
the government spent millions of zlotys to purchase extra 
supplies of holiday goods like oranges lemons bananas and raisins 
and supplies of other traditional christmas foods like carp and 
imported wines from hungary and soviet georgia 
shoppers at hala mirowska said that in terms of most holiday food 
the government had largely succeeded not so bad as you can 
see said one woman standing in line for holiday poppyseed cakes 
but for hams better meats and consumer goods for giving as 
presents there was disappointment 
there are no boots and a lot of things you need for life 
said kilinski 
maybe it could have been better

the vatican said friday that roman catholic 
university clinics were challenging church teaching by continuing 
research into testtube conception which the church rejects 
an editorial in the vaticans newspaper losservatore romano 
said the church feels determined as never before to safeguard 
the common good against technological manipulation of the very 
fonts of life 
the oscillations and discord in the catholic camp have 
contributed to rendering the question more complex said the 
editorial 
above all the gravity of the decision of several catholic 
university clinics to continue under certain conditions the 
practive of homologous in vitro fertilizaton cannot be 
undervalued 
such resolve from the moment it was made public has become a 
challenge as well the newspaper said 
in january a vatican meeting failed to resolve a dispute between 
the vatican and three catholic universities in europe on researching 
testtube conception 
in 1987 a vatican document approved by pope john ii had 
condemned testtube conception surrogate motherhood and 
experimentation on live embryos 
it also branded as immoral the freezing of embryos cloning 
attempts to fashion animalhuman hybrids and the implanation of 
embryos in artificial or animal uteruses 
shortly after the documents publication the catholic university 
of lille france announced it will continue experiments with 
invitro fertilization to help couples who otherwise couldnt 
have children 
the january meeting was with rectors of the lille institution 
universite catholique de louvain in belgium and hollands 
katholieke universiteit of nijmegen 
roman catholic teaching holds that the only moral way to create 
human life is normal sexual acts between a married couple in in 
vitro methods an egg is taken from a womans ovary and united 
with sperm outside the womb when life begins to grow the 
fertilized egg is then implanted in a womb 
referring to the universities decision the editorial continued 
the directors of this very serious rebellion try still to 
justify themselves by claiming to respect the roman teaching 
the editorial said the clinics claim not to understand the 
reasons for the stance of the vaticans congregation for the 
doctrine of the faith 
the congregation is the vaticans watchdog for doctrinal 
orthodoxy 
the newspaper asserted that use of artificial birth control ended 
up being an incentive for abortion and that similarly it is 
becoming evident that artifical procreation puts as its operating 
premise discriminating cultural choices as to what kind of babies 
would be born

a bouquet of red tulips lay on the steps of 
syracuse universitys study center as students and teachers ended a 
memorial service friday for classmates killed in the pan am crash 
they hugged one another and wept clustered in small groups 
outside the gray stone church where the morning service was held 
and met at the elegant mansion that houses their school across the 
street 
they had such a passionate interest in life and a desire to 
make the world better malcolm ingrim a syracuse drama professor 
said as he remembered the six he taught and the other students 
killed in the crash wednesday night 
when all that is snuffed out in 30 seconds its impossible to 
make any sense of it he said its shattering 
the 35 syracuse students were among 258 people who died when the 
new yorkbound boeing 747 crashed in the scottish village of 
lockerbie on wednesday 
paul smith an english major from kennett square pa heard the 
news wednesday night while in a pub with friends 
it wasnt real i couldnt believe it he said 
smith shared a house with six friends including amy shapiro a 
student from stamford conn who died in the crash like others he 
knew just about all 270 students on the closeknit london program 
the students were chosen for the program for their academic 
ability and studied at the 19th century mansion on fashionable 
ladbroke grove with syracuse and london school of economics 
professors the term ended dec 17 and most had already gone home 
when the crash occurred 
after a friend got a call from the united states and went to the 
pub to tell them smith and the others raced to the study center to 
wait for news sometime past midnight they learned the students had 
made the flight and that there were no survivors 
it still isnt real you keep expecting amy to walk through the 
door he said his hands in his pockets and his eyes downcast 
asked what she was like he said she was the happiest person 
alive 
kristin huffmon a junior from madison nj said ms shapiro 
was studying photography and had always said halfjokingly that 
her dream was to work for national geographic magazine 
doesnt every photojournalism student want to work for national 
geographic that was amys joke said ms huffmon a political 
science major 
ingrim who is originally from london said three of his students 
theodora cohen miriam wolfe and nicole boulanger were planning 
to set up a theater troupe at school upon their return three 
others jason coker tim cardwell and turhan ergin also studied 
drama under him 
they were all extremely gifted he said when i see kids of 
such promise and energy i cannot imagine how the parents are 
feeling right now i just cant imagine 
at the memorial service at st johns church in west london 
vicar harold stringer and a local rabbi jacqueline tabick led the 
small group through prayers and hymns 
they read out the names of those lost and observed a moment of 
silence

plo chairman yasser arafat today blamed terrorists 
for the crash of the pan am jetliner in scotland condemning it as 
an inhuman criminal action that undermines the peace process in 
the middle east 
at a news conference at the end of his oneday visit to rome 
arafat made his first public comment on the crash of the boeing 747 
in lockerbie scotland that killed all 258 people aboard and at 
least 22 on the ground 
this is an inhuman criminal action which we condemn arafat 
said it is against our peace mission it is not against a state 
it is directed against humanity as a whole it is another proof that 
we should all fight against this type of terrorist act 
we join other nations in an effort to stop this terrorism and 
criminal acts he added 
the united states last week reversed a 13year policy and opened 
a substantive dialogue with the plo after arafat renounced 
terrorism and accepted israels right to exist us officials have 
said the talks will be scuttled if there is proof of plo involvement 
in terrorism 
arafat said he was very sad because the pan am crash claimed 
the life of one of my friends referring to bernt carlsson the 
un official involved in negotiations for independence of namibia 
i send my heartfelt condolences to all the victims of this 
crime 
investigators in britain are trying to determine if the pan am 
plane was destroyed by a bomb foreign minister moshe arens of 
israel on friday linked the crash to palestinian factions 
i am really astonished that rumors were directed against the 
palestinians only arafat said 
asked whether he could control terrorist abu nidal and other 
radical palestinian factions he said these groups are not 
palestinian groups they follow the intelligence of several arab and 
other states 
arafat said he could only account for groups and individuals 
under the plo flag he claimed the israeli secret service mossad 
was trying to undermine the usplo dialogue 
according to my information the mossad has already received 
their orders from the israeli government to sabotage the peace 
process he said he did not elaborate 
it is very important for everyone to know we are pushing to 
achieve peace not only the palestinian leadership but our masses 
arafat said we are against all forms of terrorism 
he said mossad and other groups posed a greater threat all of 
us have to coordinate efforts to face all forms of terrorism he 
said

pope john paul ii told yasser arafat during a 
20minute meeting friday he believes palestinians and jews have an 
identical fundamental right to their own countries the vatican 
said 
he also called for negotiations and urged israelis and 
palestinians to live in peace in that land where the prince of 
peace was born vatican spokesman joaquin navarro said 
navarro said the pontiff and the palestine liberation 
organization chairman had a cordial talk 
this audience did not provoke the protest from israel and jewish 
groups caused by the one arafat was granted six years ago 
in mild criticism spokesman alon liel of the israeli foreign 
ministry said peace in the holy land can hardly be served by such 
a meeting 
israeli leaders also have met with john paul but the vatican 
does not have formal relations with the jewish state citing 
israels unsettled boundaries and the palestinian problem as reasons 
john paul appeared more receptive to arafat this time greeting 
him in the private library where he usually sees heads of state and 
other dignitaries in 1982 they talked in a small room in the 
modern paul vi audience hall 
a vatican statement said the pontiff met arafat in order to 
encourage dialogue the only means to find an equitable solution to 
the mideast conflict ruling out every form of recourse to arms and 
violence and above all terrorism and reprisals 
it said the pope expressed his hope that both peoples would 
soon see the beginning of a real process of understanding and of 
peace which would put an end finally to their suffering and their 
fears 
the holy father reiterated that he was profoundly convinced 
that the two peoples had an identical fundamental right to their own 
homelands in which they could live in liberty dignity and security 
in harmony with the neighboring peoples 
arafats meeting with john paul occurred after the plo chief 
conferred with italian government leaders he is touring europe to 
seek support for an international middle east peace conference and 
the independent palestinian state proclaimed nov 15 
navarro told reporters arafat briefed the pope on middle east 
developments and that john paul asked questions but would not 
provide details 
john paul has long supported some form of homeland for 
palestinians the vatican reacted warmly to the call for a 
palestinian state and praised the united states for deciding to talk 
with the plo after arafat recognized israel and renounced terrorism 
the plo in turn has looked to the vatican for support 
palestinian leaders said the popes first meeting with arafat six 
years ago sas a turning point in the organizations search for 
international recognition 
four aides accompanied arafat to the friday audience including 
farouk kaddoumi head of the plo political department with john 
paul was a priest who translated arafats arabic into italian 
arafat gave the pontiff a carved wooden nativity scene and john 
paul gave the plo chairman a book about the vatican 
earlier friday arafat met with premier ciriaco de mita and 
foreign minister giulio andreotti at the premiers office 
andreotti said the meeting confirmed the moderate line taken 
by the plo an umbrella organization of several palestinian groups 
including arafats fatah 
he said arafat gave a very positive evaluation of talks with 
the united states which ended a 13year ban by washington on 
contacts with the plo 
a statement from de mitas office reaffirmed italys support for 
an international middle east peace conference

the cockpit recording of pan am flight 
103s last minutes ended abruptly after a faint noise and 
conversations among the crew gave no clues about what caused the 
plane to crash officials said today 
there is nothing in the conversations of the flight crew to 
indicate anything was wrong said paul mckie department of 
transport spokesman 
there is a faint noise at the end which needs a bit more 
analysis there is no indication what that noise is it would be 
quite wrong to jump to any conclusions he said 
the cockpit recording and flight data tapes from the boeing 747 
were being analyzed by the departments air accident investigation 
branch 
british and american investigators sifted through crash debris as 
relatives of some of the 258 victims aboard the jumbo jet gathered 
in a nearby town 
the noise is heard on the recorder that preserves the last 30 
minutes of conversation in the cockpit the other recorder monitors 
flight data 
mckie told the associated press there was nothing abnormal on the 
tapes up to the moment they cut off there were no abnormal noises 
on the tape until the signals ended abruptly with the aircraft 
cruising at 31000 feet 
although us embassies in europe had received warnings that a 
pan am plane would be bombed the chief british investigator at 
lockerbie the scottish village where the plane crashed said no 
evidence of a bomb had been found yet 
mick charles of the air accident investigation branch told a news 
conference we have no evidence whatsoever yet of sabotage but 
added this did not mean sabotage was ruled out 
he said the spread of debris over many miles was not unusual 
since the plane was six miles high and winds were 115 knots in 
these circumstances a lot of the debris is going to be sent a very 
long distance 
frank taylor an aviation safety consultant and former 
investigator for the us national transportation safety board said 
a cockpit recording that appears normal until the end could indicate 
an explosion knocked out communications electricity and perhaps 
even severed the cockpit from the aircraft taylor made his comments 
in washington on thursday before cockpit data from the pan am 
flight was released 
while aviation experts were reluctant to provide details it is 
generally known that an explosive device placed in certain areas of 
the baggage compartment of a boeing 747 could wipe out computer 
electrical and communications systems as well as possibly 
incapacitate the flight crew 
in israel foreign minister moshe arens today linked the crash to 
palestinian factions an israeli newspaper and terror experts blamed 
syrianbacked radical groups opposed to the usplo dialogue 
arens interviewed in hebrew on israel radio said that based 
on our assumptions and those of our experts this is an operation 
of international terror apparently arab international terror 
yasser arafat leader of the palestine liberation organization 
today blamed terrorists for the crash of the jetliner condemning it 
as an inhuman criminal act that undermines the peace process in 
the middle east 
arafat made his first public comments on the crash at a news 
conference in rome where he concluded a oneday visit he said 
we join other nations in an effort to stop this terrorism and 
criminal acts 
i am really astonished that rumors were directed against the 
palestinians only he said and accused the israeli secret 
service mossad of trying to undermine the usplo dialogue 
the israeli newspaper the nation quoted unidentified western 
intelligence sources as saying the syrianbacked ahmed jibril group 
was responsible 
the state department meanwhile said four americans on board the 
plane were state department employees 
a state department official speaking on condition of anonymity 
said two were involved in diplomatic security one at the us 
embassy in nicosia cyprus and the other at the us embassy in 
beirut lebanon two others were diplomats assigned to the beirut 
embassy he said 
the official said an israeli radio report that two of the 
americans had been involved in negotiations to secure the release of 
american hostages in lebanon was totally false 
in carlisle 33 miles from lockerbie relatives of the 258 people 
who died on the boeing 747 began gathering to identify the remains 
of loved ones another 22 people reportedly died on the ground at 
lockerbie 
townspeople stood in a heavy rain today solemnly reading the 
lists of the missing 
about 70 bodies found by search parties still lay outdoors and 
about 80 were placed in a makeshift morgue in the town hall while 
investigators from west germany scotland yard and the united states 
joined the search 
the sudden catastrophe that made the plane break up over a wide 
patch of scottish countryside pointed either to major structural 
failure or a bomb and aviation experts agreed the latter was most 
likely 
speculation about a terrorist attack was fueled by a threat 
received dec 5 by the us embassy in helsinki finland which us 
sources believed was linked to the abu nidal group of palestinian 
radicals 
the state department said an anonymous caller told the us 
embassy a pan am flight bound for new york from frankfurt west 
germany would be targeted 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt 
in addition an anonymous caller to the associated press in 
london on thursday claimed a proiranian group called guardians of 
the islamic revolution planted a bomb on the plane 
the caller said the motive was revenge for the july downing of an 
iranian jetliner in the persian gulf by the us warship vincennes 
iran has denied involvement in the crash 
fbi director william sessions told reporters in san francisco he 
had reports of numerous callers claiming responsibility including 
some who claimed affiliation with terrorist groups 
us ambassador charles h price ii and british cabinet minister 
malcolm rifkind the secretary of state for scotland both said 
after inspecting the wreckage they were convinced an explosion 
occurred 
the us national transportation and safety board sent four 
investigators to britain and the federal aviation administration 
sent three observers the justice department said it also offered 
fbi forensics and disaster units

commandos with explosive charges 
attacked the defense ministry and military headquarters in the 
capital today military sources said no casualties were immediately 
reported

ministry and the joint chiefs of staff was attacked during 
salvadors nineyear guerrilla war 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity gave no other 
details 
radio reports indicated that two car bombs detonated near the 
walled compound in the southwest part of the city but the reports 
could not be immediately confirmed 
no one claimed responsibility but the attackers were presumed to 
be members of the farabundo marti liberation front a leftwing 
insurgency trying to overthrow the government in the last year it 
has attacked installations in the capital with car bombs and 
catapultlaunched homemade bombs 
earlier in the day unidentified terrorists killed a night 
watchman and set off three bombs destroying the interior of the 
biology lab building at the national university an official at the 
institution said 
the official told the associated press that unidentified 
individuals cut through a metal fence before dawn to enter the 
campus in the capitals northwestern sector the official who

if a terrorist bomb brought down pan am flight 
103 a 25minute delay of the jets departure from london may 
provide investigators with their biggest advantage it kept the 
wreckage on land instead of falling into the ocean 
the cause of wednesdays crash that killed all 258 people on 
board and more than 20 on the ground has yet to be determined but 
there were signs today pointing to an explosion 
witnesses saw a flash of light high in the sky as the jet 
plummeted toward the ground there was no communication from the 
cockpit as would have been expected if the pilots encountered flight 
control problems and the wreckage was strewn over miles of scottish 
countryside with the cockpit section found more than three miles 
from other large parts of the aircraft 
from scotland officials investigating the crash said today that 
the cockpit recording of the flights last minutes ended abruptly 
after a faint noise they also said conversations among the crew 
gave no clues about what caused the plane to crash 
there is nothing in the conversations of the flight crew to 
indicate anything was wrong said paul mckie spokesman for the 
british department of transport 
the cockpit recording and flight data tapes from the boeing 747 
were being analyzed by the departments air accident investigation 
branch 
there is a faint noise at the end which needs a bit more 
analysis there is no indication what that noise is said mckie 
but none of that is conclusive evidence that a bomb detonated 
aboard the jetliner 
president reagan said today that a public warning about the 
flight after an anonymous telephone call to the us embassy in 
helsinki would literally have closed down air traffic in the 
world the president said he believes all precautions were 
taken in the warning which went to the airline and us embassies 
reagan speaking in the rain outside the white house as he 
departed for california where he will spend the holidays offered 
condolences to the families of the victims calling for christmas 
prayers for their loss 
us officials said the caller to the embassy in finland on dec 
5 said that a bomb would be planted aboard a pan am flight from 
frankfurt west germany to the united states within two weeks 
flight 103 began in frankfurt on a boeing 727 then changed planes 
to a boeing 747 in london but there has been no evidence that the 
telephone tip was related to the crash of flight 103 
in addition an anonymous caller to the associated press in 
london on thursday claimed a proiranian group called guardians of 
the islamic revolution planted a bomb on the plane 
the caller said the motive was revenge for the july downing of an 
iranian jetliner in the persian gulf by the us warship vincennes 
but iran has denied involvement in the crash 
the wreckage of flight 103 is expected to provide more definitive 
clues and while it is strewn over miles of countryside at least it 
is not hundreds of feet under wintry seas some aviation experts 
noted 
in other us developments related to the pan am crash 
white house officials defended the process by which the state 
department warned us embassies but not the general public that 
a bomb threat had been made against pan am they said the government 
would review whether public notification should be considered in 
future such cases 
presidentelect bush said that if there were hard evidence 
that a specific flight was threatened or that the threat could not 
be averted the public should be warned nevertheless he said most 
such threats never materialize 
fbi director william sessions said in san francisco there have 
been a number of calls from individuals some claiming to speak 
for various terrorist groups taking responsibility for the crash 
sessions provided no specifics 
flight 103 had been airborne 54 minutes when it disappeared from 
radar screens while cruising at 31000 feet over scotland it was 
about to head westbound over the atlantic when tragedy struck 
another half hour and the plane would have been well over water 
you would have had another air india situation said frank 
taylor an aviation safety consultant and former longtime 
investigator for the national transportation safety board 
to many investigators the pan am tragedy appears to resemble the 
l985 crash of an air india boeing 747 off the irish coast that 
jumbo jet also plummeted from the sky from 31000 feet without a 
hint of trouble from the pilots 
but the wreckage landed in the ocean and salvage crews struggled 
for four months to gather pieces including the black box 
recorders that would provide clues an analysis of the final split 
second of the voice recorder was key to indian officials concluding 
that a bomb had exploded aboard the aircraft 
the authorities probing the pan am crash clearly will have more 
to work with they already have found the critical black box 
recorders one that monitors cockpit conversation and noises and 
another that records aircraft performance 
investigators will pay close attention to how parts of the 
aircraft are bent tangled and singed and whether there are signs of 
residue from an explosion they also will search for fragments that 
might have been used as a detonator and closely examine luggage and 
parts of luggage for residue from an explosive 
the black box recorders are likely to provide as they do in 
most aviation crashes the most critical evidence say aviation 
experts 
the tape from the cockpit recorder may be as important for what 
it doesnt say as for what it does say veteran investigators is 
there a fragmented sound of an explosion are there any exchanges 
between pilots about control problems did the tape suddenly stop 
with no evidence of an emergency or structural concern 
if all seems normal right to the end it will be strong evidence 
that a powerful explosion might have knocked out communications 
electricity and perhaps even literally severed the cockpit from the 
rest of the aircraft says taylor if you lost all communications 
lost all electrical power on and airplane the pilots now are 
nothing more than passengers 
it would not take a large amount of explosives to do the job 
suggested a number of experts 
if a bomb severs some major or important electrical wiring or 
hydraulic lines or cables you could lose your ability to control 
the airplane noted john mazor a spokesman for the air line 
pilots association 
while aviation experts were reluctant to provide details that 
could be used as a primer for terrorism it is generally known that 
if an explosive device even a small one can be placed in certain 
areas of the baggage compartment of a boeing 747 it could wipe out 
critical computer electrical and communications systems as well as 
possibly incapacitate the flight crew 
some safety experts say such a scenario explains the sudden loss 
of communications while the pan am jet was at cruise altitude and 
its rapid fall and breakup while still in the sky 
they point out that commercial jetliners have over the years been 
kept aloft for some time even when encountering major structural 
problems short of an explosion 
in l985 the pilots of a japan air lines boeing 747 struggled to 
keep their plane flying for about 32 minutes after a failure in the 
rear cabin bulkhead caused rapid depressurization the jet finally 
crashed into a mountain killing 520 people aboard

pleading for the american journalist and the 14 other foreigners 
held in lebanon peggy say declared in an open letter to the 
proiranian captors i pray for you to have the courage to bring 
this to a peaceful conclusion her appeal was published in beirut 
newspapers 
nine of the hostages are americans including anderson the 
41yearold chief middle east correspondent of the associated press 
he was seized by shiite moslem gunmen march 16 1985 while 
returning home from a saturday morning game of tennis and has been 
held the longest 
lebanons most influential shiite cleric said friday the case of 
the western hostages should be settled if iranian captives are freed 
and israel releases palestinian and lebanese prisoners 
we are hearing these days many messages and calls for the 
release of the western hostages said sheik mohammed hussein 
fadlallah spiritual guide of hezbollah party of god believed to 
be an umbrella organization for groups holding hostages 
we have said time and again that we want this matter closed 
fadlallah said in a sermon at the bir elabed mosque in beiruts 
southern slums where most of the foreigners are thought to be held 
we add our voice to those calling for the release of the 
foreign hostages provided all captives including iranians in east 
beirut and lebanese and palestinians held by israel are also freed 
there should be no distinction among kidnap victims let the 
cry be for the release of all hostages with no discrimination lets 
treat the case from its humanitarian angle let us preserve the 
humanity of all of the captives three iranian embassy diplomats 
and their driver have been missing since they tried to flee moslem 
west beirut through the christian eastern sector during israels 
1982 invasion of lebanon they were stopped by christian militiamen 
and are believed dead

but there is little hope in my heart that i will see terry and other 
hostages released during these christmas holidays 
it is difficult to sustain hope after almost four years of 
working and praying for freedom for terry and the other hostages 
some days it seems we have made no progress and are farther from our 
goal than ever 
we hear mixed messages from the middle east and we have no 
clear guidelines about what we should do or could do on behalf of 
these innocent men 
addressing her brothers kidnappers islamic jihad islamic holy 
war she said only you their captors can end this stalemate 
we have all suffered enough please may god be with you and peace

hundreds of israeli army 
troops moved into bethlehem on friday to guard against violence as 
christian pilgrims gather for christmas celebrations 
holiday activities in this west bank town of 35000 were to be 
reduced from previous years in sympathy with the yearlong 
palestinian uprising against israeli rule in the occupied 
territories 
israel has controlled the territories since the 1967 middle east 
war when it captured the west bank from jordan and the gaza strip 
from egypt 
israeli troops took up positions on the roads into bethlehem in 
its central manger square and on roofs of the nearby market the 
square is in front of the church of the nativity which was built 
over the grotto where jesus was born 
helmeted soldiers manned rooftop machine gun posts and dozens of 
military jeeps and trucks clogged the manger square parking lot 
army officials declined to say how many soldiers were sent to the 
area citing security reasons 
the proplo underground leadership of the uprising has called on 
residents in the territories to strike on saturday in remembrance of 
the 333 palestinians killed in the revolt most have been shot to 
death in clashes with israeli troops fourteen israelis also have 
died 
the strike was expected to close all shops and offices in the 
territories including in bethlehem 
in one deserted clothes shop friday a merchant named khalad 
complained that bethlehem is being reoccupied by the army i see 
more soldiers than i saw in 1967 when we were first occupied how 
can people shop they are afraid to leave their homes 
he asked not to give his last name for fear of reprisal 
in the center of bethlehem slogans painted on the wall by 
uprising supporters said remain home on the 24th of december and 
lets escalate the intefadeh which is arabic for uprising 
in jerusalem a foreign ministry official said he expected 
israels new coalition government to consider two ideas toward peace 
one would be calling elections in the occupied territories to 
select palestinian negotiators acceptable to israel and the plo the 
other is seeking a sovietamerican meeting to launch direct 
arabisraeli negotiations the previous coalition government 
considered both options 
the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity 
said israeli leaders already have rejected the option of giving the 
occupied lands autonomy 
palestinians have demanded an independent state 
bethlehems palestinian mayor elias freij on friday rejected 
israelsponsored elections 
if the balloting is for the purpose of electing a new 
leadership to be parallel to the plo i doubt very much that any 
palestinian will participate freij said in an interview with 
israel radio 
he called on israeli leaders to open talks with representatives 
of the plo as the united states did last week 
freij earlier announced that most of the citys official 
christmas celebrations would be canceled in bethlehem in solidarity 
with the uprising there will be no municipal decorations and no boy 
scout parade he said 
but the roman catholic patriarch in jerusalem michel sabbah is 
scheduled to lead a religious procession through bethlehem streets 
on saturday and the tourism ministry is sponsoring a christmas eve 
concert with choirs from spain switzerland and the shiloh baptist 
church in washington 
there are an estimated 35000 palstinian christians in the west 
bank and gaza and about 100000 arab christians in israel between 
3000 and 4000 western christians also live in jerusalem and 
surrounding areas 
also friday in the occupied lands three palestinians were shot 
and injured in clashes with soldiers hospital officials said 
a 14yearold boy was shot in the left leg following friday 
moslem prayers in the shati refugee camp in gaza city a 16yearold 
boy was shot in the left leg in the nusseirat refugee camp in the 
gaza strip and a 7yearold boy was shot in the right leg in nablus

shortly after 9 am a freak snowstorm 
hit the stewards house with fury burying the green lawn and 
blooming rose bush and plastering the windows with white stuff 
for 500 gregg steward had bought his family a white christmas 
since dec 13 the riverside ice co has shaved dozens of tons of 
ice to cover more than 20 green southern california lawns with 
inches of pure white snow under blue skies palm trees and basking 
in 70degree temperature children who have grown up with surfboards 
and skateboards have tried out sleds and toboggans for the first 
time 
while sun sand and surf might sound attractive to northerners 
shivering in their hats and mittens southern californians 
apparently tire of the tanned life at christmas time 
an arcadia shop sells plastic icicles that customers use to cover 
the front of their homes and sales of spraycan snow are up 
they like a little taste of the midwest says chuck carter 
general manager of the ice company which usually blows its ice on 
vegetable trucks traveling to the east coast in hot weather 
as ice company owner gary wittenmyer directed the blasting snow 
onto the stewards yard thursday 6yearold brett waited wearing 
puffy blue mittens and amazing spiderman boots 
beside him in pink ribbons pink turtleneck biboveralls and 
reeboks was his girlfriend ashley cunningham 6 who already knew 
what the snow was for 
im going to snow fight brett she said 
gregg steward 31 said he had taken brett and his wife bobby 
31 to the mountains the year before for christmas and they had 
enjoyed playing in the snow but this years schedule steward 
works as both a costa mesa firefighterparamedic and a riverside 
real estate agent didnt allow the time 
so we decided to bring the snow here to the family home close 
to the mojave desert he said 
by 930 am his new englandstyle home was sprinkled with five 
tons of snow that coated the roof and windows it lay 6 inches deep 
on the lawn blocking the front door brett and the neighborhood 
kids attempted a snowball battle 
some of his friends coming over have what do you call them 
those little round things steward said 
theres just not much need to know what toboggans are here 50 
miles inland from los angeles 
the company that coated stewards yard has had calls from 60 
miles west in beverly hills and manhattan beach since news broke of 
their miniblizzards they are booked solid for christmas eve and 
have lined up jobs for new years and valentines day 
the minimum snowjob costs 300 for 20 300pound blocks of ice 
that are shaved into three tons of snow last week the company put 
15 tons of snow on a moreno valley lawn for a neighborhood block 
party 
the snow which consists of fine ice pellets similar to snow cone 
ice lasts for two to three days without rain about one day with 
rainfall the green grass usually survives despite the cold shower 
wittenmyer said the ice company has made more snow in the past 
two weeks than in all his 15 years at the company all because his 
wife sandy ran an ad for the usually lowkey business in the 
newspaper 
its just gone wild he said 
but as a transplanted ohioan wittenmyer sees the irony in his 
new business 
i came to california to get out of that stuff he said 
what would the folks back home think now 
theyre going to think im really a whiz kid selling ice and 
snow to californians

a centrist coalition of southern baptists has 
launched a bid to win over members of the nations largest 
protestant denomination which has been torn for a decade between 
conservatives and more liberal members 
the 146 millionmember church has been divided since 1979 over 
how literally the bible must be accepted with conservatives who 
believe every account in the bible actually happened controlling 
the denominations hierarchy 
last week a group calling itself baptists committed to the 
southern baptist convention threw its hat into the ring promoting 
itself as an alternative between the two sides its goals say 
organizers are to educate grassroots baptists about issues in the 
denomination and to win control away from the conservatives 
if theres an identifiable group which believes in southern 
baptist polity and southern baptist principles of the separation of 
church and state the priesthood of the believer and the 
unquestioned authority of god well thats who i am said the 
rev richard jackson an arizona pastor who was defeated in june in 
his bid for presidency of the denomination 
baptist conservatives had mixed reactions to the organization 
i affirm the right of baptists to get together and discuss 
anything they want to discuss said the rev jerry vines of 
jacksonville fla who is the denominations president 
paul pressler the houston judge who has been an architect of the 
conservative strategy told the dallas times herald that he wishes 
dissenters would stop fighting 
the southern baptist convention needs healing and working 
together not an escalation of political activity he said 
many of the participants at last weeks twoday meeting have been 
active in previous efforts to wrest control of the church from 
current leaders among its plans was to launch a new publication to 
provide news that does not appear in the conventions newsletter 
the new organization is a coalition of regional groups including 
message a texasbased group and baptist laity for the baptist 
faith

the volunteer program started on a small scale in 1981 but has 
grown to a systemized effort involving about 500 volunteers who go 
to work on christmas day so that christian workers may celebrate at 
home with their families 
members of the citys jewish community launched the pinch 
hitter program when they saw that many people who wanted to be at 
home for the holiday had jobs that required them to work on 
christmas 
christmas obviously holds little significance to the jewish 
community and here was a chance to let our christian counterparts 
celebrate the holiday said jeff rubin associate publisher of the 
atlanta jewish times a weekly newspaper which last year became a 
cosponsor of the program 
its an opportunity to promote brotherhood and volunteerism in 
the same breath rubin said 
started by the gate city lodge of bnai brith the jewish 
fraternal organization the program had about 50 volunteers 
participating the first couple of years this year organizers are 
expecting about 500 people to work at nine hospitals 
the volunteers do just about any task required rubin said 
including janitorial work kitchen duty and assisting in nonmedical 
patient care 
dave abrams cochairman of the program said some hospital 
officials at first were surprised by the willingness of the 
volunteers to do menial tasks 
theyd think in many cases we dont want to get our hands dirty 
but thats what this games all about abrams said were 
not replacing the doctors were replacing the minimum wage people 
in addition to providing a break for some workers the volunteers 
also help patients enjoy the holiday said judy smith spokeswoman 
for emory university hospitals rehabilitation center one of the 
facilities participating in the program 
the volunteers have spent time with the centers patients some 
of whom do not have family in the area and are alone for christmas 
ms smith said 
its a real important asset for our rehabilitation 
population she said 
as the program has grown there has been an effort to make it 
better organized rubin said a committee this year is coordinating 
the needs of the hospitals with the available volunteers so that the 
facilities get the number of people they need 
another sign of the programs growth abrams said is that a few 
nonjews have joined as volunteers 
christmas can be a very lonely day for nonjews who dont have 
families he said weve had some call up and ask to volunteer

neal sher head of the justice departments 
nazihunting unit friday questioned why the state department didnt 
alert all government agencies to the terrorist bomb threat prior to 
the crash of the pan am jumbo jet in scotland 
sher director of the office of special investigations lost one 
of his aides in the crash michael bernstein who was returning from 
austria after negotiating an agreement in which the vienna 
government agreed to take back a former ss concentration camp guard 
living in la puente calif 
sher was in budapest hungary on official business at the time 
of the crash and flew out of frankfurt west germany on another pan 
american world airways flight cutting his trip short when he found 
out about bernsteins death 
the pan am flight that crashed wednesday en route to new york had 
originated in frankfurt 
us officials said thursday a caller to the us embassy in 
helsinki finland on dec 5 said a bomb would be planted aboard a 
pan am flight from frankfurt to the united states within two weeks 
the state department said it issued a widespread alert about the 
bomb threat to airlines airport security officials and us 
embassies the department said it believed the carriers and airport 
security in particular should be responsible for enhancing 
security matters in such circumstances 
asked whether the rest of the government should have been 
informed of the threat which the state department deemed serious 
enough to post in a bulletin board notice at embassies sher said he 
would have flown on another airline if i had known this threat was 
out there on pan am 
im very upset sher added people in my office travel all 
over the world all the time 
besides bernstein three state department employees a peace 
corps volunteer and at least a dozen us military personnel were 
among the 258 passengers and crew that died in the crash 
sher called bernstein one of the best lawyers who ever came 
through the office of special investigations and said bernstein 
had won a major victory in his trip to vienna 
during negotiations austria agreed to accept josef eckert who 
admitted his membership in an ss guard unit assigned to the 
auschwitz concentration camp complex during world war ii bernstein 
informed sher of the austrians agreement in a conversation shortly 
before the crash 
bernstein 36 who is survived by his wife and two children took 
a pay cut when he left a private law firm in 1985 and went to work 
for sher after reading a news story about osi 
theres no question that mike was doing this out of 
dedication sher said

the company dental plan 
doesnt cover it but that isnt stopping anne marie orser from 
getting braces for maddie her 6monthold golden retriever 
i always hoped i wouldnt have to put braces on my daughter 
said orser of maple ridge a vancouver suburb i never thought my 
dog would have to have braces 
the dog is being given a perfect smile and snarl by vancouver 
veterinarian james anthony one of the few in canada who performs 
animal orthodontics his prices range from 150 to 500 
as in humans animal orthodontics correct teeth positions so the 
pet can eat properly and will have less chance of contracting gum 
and tooth disease 
unlike teenagers and preteens who often must wear braces for 
years maddies teeth should be straightened within a few weeks 
anthony said 
orser said she especially feared a crooked bottom tooth could 
grow through the roof of maddies mouth but also wanted the pet to 
look her best for dog shows 
were doing it for better health care not doing it could be 
risking periodontal disease she said shes definitely part of 
the family so she gets treated as part of the family

the british government issued no public warnings 
about a threat made against pan am flights because the information 
was considered confidential an official said friday 
the department of transport said british airports also were not 
told about the information passed on by us authorities the threat 
mentioned a pan am flight from frankfurt west germany and did not 
specifically mention britain 
transport minister michael portillo said in a british 
broadcasting corp television interview that the warning was not 
made public because this was confidential classified us 
intelligence information and we didnt have the right to divulge 
it 
the opposition labor partys transport spokesman john prescott 
said the governments failure to publicize the threat ended in the 
poor ignorant traveling public taking greater risk 
portillo said that many warnings are received over the course 
of a few months and if these are just fed out to the public without 
any assessment then they would lose their impact 
he told independent television news this particular warning 
was assessed we looked very carefully at the procedures that we had 
in place for american airline flights those procedures are greater 
than for some other flights and that was regarded as being 
appropriate 
a new yorkbound pan american world airways jumbo jet that took 
off from londons heathrow airport crashed in southwest scotland on 
wednesday killing all aboard 
pan am flight 103 originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727 and 
passengers and luggage were transferred to the boeing 747 at 
heathrow 
heathrow said in a statement it did not receive any 
notification of a reported threat against a pan american aircraft 
prime minister margaret thatchers administration friday ordered 
a security review at all british airports a day after scotland 
yards antiterrorism squad began an investigation at heathrow into 
whether a bomb was smuggled into the plane 
the state department said thursday that an unidentified person 
telephoned the us embassy in helsinki finland on dec 5 and said 
there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks against a pan am 
aircraft flying from frankfurt to the united states 
the caller claimed to belong to the abu nidal group a radical 
palestinian faction 
the state department said it passed the threat to pan am and to 
us embassies 
portillo said us authorities notified the government dec 9 of 
a bomb threat against usbound pan am jetliners arriving from 
frankfurt this month 
in washington president reagan told reporters that to issue a 
public warning based on an anonymous threat would literally have 
closed down all the air traffic in the world 
an unidentified british security source was quoted friday by a 
london newspaper the independent as saying suspicion focused on 
proiranian terrorists and that a claim of responsibility from a 
caller saying he represented a group called the guardians of the 
islamic revolution was being taken very seriously 
it quoted the source as saying the group was thought to have 
taken revenge for us downing on july 3 of an iranian airliner 
carrying 290 people over the persian gulf 
an anonymous caller to the associated press in london claimed 
thursday the guardians of the islamic revolution was responsible 
the source said the abu nidal group reportedly had been in 
contact with proiranian groups before wednesday nights crash 
government and industry officials said it seemed clear that the 
pan am jet broke apart in flight strewing blazing wreckage over the 
scottish village of lockerbie and surrounding hills 
such a sudden catastrophe would be consistent with reports by 
flight controllers that the cockpit sent no distress call as the 
plane having reached cruising altitude of 31000 feet disappeared 
from radar

portauprince haiti ap the expulsion of a radical slum 
priest from his ecclesiastic order has silenced haitis most 
influential voice for the rights of the nations poor 
in expelling the rev jeanbertrand aristide the conservative 
salesian order accused the populist roman catholic cleric of 
fomenting class warfare calling him a protagonist of 
destabilization 
his ouster was announced dec 15 in a statement from rome 
although aristide remains a priest he cannot officiate at mass or 
deliver sermons over church radio 
he has been neutralized said sociologist franklyn midi 
aristide 35 a salesian priest since 1975 has been one of the 
most outspoken campaigners for social justice in a country ruled for 
nearly its entire 184year existence by dictators 
he has escaped at least three attempts on his life including a 
sept 11 attack at his st jean bosco church in a portauprince 
slum in which thugs armed with machetes guns clubs and spears 
killed 12 people and wounded at least 70 others 
one week later rankandfile soldiers overthrew lt gen henri 
namphy in a coup that put lt gen prosper avril in power coup 
leaders said they wanted democratic reforms and an end to 
statesponsored violence citing the church massacre as an example 
salesian officials expelled aristide after he failed to obey 
their order to leave haiti by oct 17 and assume a new post in 
canada 
two previous transfer orders were rescinded because of popular 
protests thousands protested in support of aristide for several 
days in october but there were no immediate demonstrations after 
the expulsion 
aristide who has been seen in public only once since the church 
massacre has made no public statement and has declined requests for 
interviews but friends say his morale is excellent and he might 
appeal the church decision 
despite its condemnation of military brutality and humanrights 
abuses in haiti the catholic hierarchy has long opposed aristides 
political proselytizing of the poor 
a proponent of liberation theology which advocates church 
involvement in a political struggle by the poor against social 
injustice aristide preaches active nonviolence he urges a 
real revolution to bring democracy to haiti but does not 
specifically propose an armed uprising 
his pulpit style is that of a fireandbrimstone preacher whose 
leading questions prompt quick responses from the congregation the 
sermons were broadcast nationwide and earned aristide a huge 
following among the urban poor and the rural peasantry who call the 
bespectacled ascetic their prophet 
although civic leaders and many priests applauded aristides 
crusade the church hierarchy apparently feared the possible 
consequences of radicalizing the masses 
the upper and middle classes of course have heaved a sigh of 
relief midi said of aristides ouster they are uncomfortable 
when the voice of the poor is raised too high 
what they have not understood is that aristide has contained 
the resentment of the impoverished masses by giving it a religious 
form midi added he has not sent them into the streets but 
drawn them into the church 
a salesian spokesman in rome the rev joseph aubrey told the 
voice of america that the expulsion was ordered because haitian 
bishops worried about the results of aristides action 
but the rev serge miot secretary of haitian bishops council 
denied that the council had asked the salesians to expel aristide 
the effective silencing of aristide coincides with a move by 
avril to tighten army discipline after a purported oct 14 coup 
attempt since then the government has imprisoned or discharged 
dozens of soldiers for alleged insubordination 
leftist politicians have accused the government of clamping down 
on the most progressive element in the army soldiers angered by 
the slow progress in bringing about the democratic reforms avril 
promised when he became president 
it is not known what role if any the government had in 
aristides ouster but to some the priest has become a symbol of 
the democratic struggle 
aristide was discharged from his religious order in the same 
way that soldiers faithful to the sept 17 reform movement have been 
discharged from the army said paul dejean a haitian author and 
social worker referring to those who participated in the coup to 
gain democratic reforms 
people who believe in the gospel values of liberation liberty 
and justice are penalized and punished he said

the army said friday it has grounded its 234 
ch47d mediumlift chinook helicopters to allow inspection of 
possibly faulty transmissions 
ten chinooks have been involved in accidents since 1985 and 16 
soldiers were killed in incidents involving the helicopter this 
year although there is no indication that faulty transmissions were 
the cause said army spokeswoman paige eversole 
the army grounded the copter fleet in what it called a 
precautionary action after the manufacturer the boeing co 
discovered that certain transmissions may have been improperly 
assembled the announcement said 
in the most recent chinook accident five servicemen were killed 
in a crash in honduras on dec 8 
last feb 25 11 soldiers were killed in a chinook crash near 
chico texas 
army officials are still investigating the dec 8 incident but 
there is no suspicion that it was linked to the possible 
transmission problem ms eversole said 
right now we are not speculating at all on the cause of that 
accident we dont know whether there is a relationship between that 
accident and this problem the army is very quick to ground the 
fleet for preventive care she said 
boeing is sending inspection teams to look at the retainer bolt 
assembly which provides for the proper alignment of internal 
gearing and bearings within the main transmission the spokeswoman 
said the inspections will require 30 days according to the 
announcement 
the first chinook ch47d entered army service in 1979 replacing 
older ch47 models the army is gradually replacing the remaining 
146 older chinooks with the d model which has more powerful 
engines and transmissions fiberglass rotor blades and advanced 
flight control systems the announcement said 
the chinook can carry a payload of 16000 pounds or ferry 33 
soldiers 
the helicopter that crashed in honduras was on a routine mission 
connected with maneuvers the army has been conducting in that 
central american country since 1982 
in the texas crash the retainer bolt assembly was not 
identified as a possible cause ms eversole said 
despite the recent crashes involving the chinook the fiscal year 
thaty ended sept 30 was the safest year on record with 18 
accidents per 100000 hours of flying time for all army aviation 
she said

president reagan offered condolences today to 
families of the victims of the pan am crash in scotland but said to 
issue a public warning based on an anonymous threat would 
literally have closed down all the air traffic in the world 
reagan made the comment in washington before arriving here for a 
twoweek california holiday vacation 
the president said it would be impossible to issue public 
warnings about all such supposed terrorist threats 
if you stop to think about it such a public statement with 
nothing but a telephone call to go on would literally have closed 
down all the air traffic in the world said reagan 
the search still goes on we have no knowledge about how the 
accident happened were still trying to find out reagan said of 
investigation into the crash on the new yorkbound flight wednesday 
in scotland that killed at least 280 people 
asked about warnings issued to some us diplomats of a threat of 
terrorist attack against a pan am flight from frankfurt he said 
all the precautions that could be taken were taken with regard to 
warning the airline and all he was referring to warnings by the 
state department and the federal aviation administration to pan am 
and police authorities but not to the general public 
phyllis oakley a state department spokeswoman said thursday 
that an unidentified individual telephoned the us embassy in 
helsinki on dec 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within 
two weeks against a pan am aircraft flying from frankfurt to the 
united states flight 103 originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727

plane to explode reagan said none of this is established 
prior to answering questions reagan read a statement with his 
wife nancy at his side 
i want to express our sorrow and concern to the families and 
friends of those who died in the pan am crash there are 
difficult aspects of this tragedy but none so compelling as the 
anguish of those families who will not have their loved ones with 
them this christmas season reagan said 
reagan noting that several dozen students from syracuse 
university lost their lives in the fiery crash young people who 
carried the twin promises of hopes and dreams 
the tragedy that steals the hopes and dreams from our society 
magnifies the loss to our society reagan said 
the president asked the nation to say a special prayer this 
christmas for the victims of the crash and their loved ones 
the president and his wife then departed on their marine one 
helicopter for andrews air force base they planned to celebrate 
christmas in their lush new bel air home and bring in the new year 
at the palatial estate of multimillionaire publisher walter 
annenberg in rancho mirage near palm springs 
the president who has spent 444 days in his home state since 
taking office in january 1981 will return to the white house jan 
5 after he leaves office jan 20 he and the first lady will move 
to bel air 
the 25 million estate was purchased by california friends of 
the reagans who are leasing it to them 
in an interview broadcast thursday night veteran abc television 
journalist david brinkley noted that some homeless sleep on grates 
or on the grass in lafayette park across pennsylvania avenue from 
the white house 
reagan replied yes but david doesnt that go back that 
there are always going to be people they make it their own choice 
for staying out there 
there are shelters in virtually every city and shelters here 
and those people still prefer out there on the grates or the lawn to 
going into one of those shelters the president said 
reagan also said that a large percentage of the homeless are 
retarded people freed from institutions after laws were changed so 
that they could only be committed to an asylum or a mental 
hospital if they represented a threat a danger to others or to 
themselves 
people particularly in you call it retarded walked away 
from those institutions they wanted freedom but they walked out to 
where there was nothing for them he said 
in the interview taped wednesday in the oval office reagan also 
commented on whether he thought soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachev whom he has joined in forging more cordial ussoviet 
relations might be forced from office 
up until now the government of that huge country or nation is 
the communist party which is really a tiny elite of the population 
of the soviet union he said 
but they literally appoint so it is possible for and weve 
seen it in the past soviet leaders to suddenly be ousted i dont 
see any indication yet or threat of that but i think its something 
that has to be considered if you look at their past history 
when asked whether he thought he had escaped blame for things 
that went wrong in his administration because people liked him 
reagan said that maybe thats in return for something because i 
like people i really do

santa claus might be a thin disagreeable 
character in a stiffbrimmed hat if not for the 19thcentury 
cartoonist thomas nast 
nast from whose pen also came the democratic donkey and the 
republican elephant gave santa his present shape short fat and 
jolly man with a stocking cap and a long white beard as a morale 
booster during the civil war 
previously santa claus was sometimes depicted as tall thin and 
domineering and often had black hair and a stiffbrimmed hat said 
james i robertson a history professor at virginia tech in 
blacksburg 
there was no stereotype of santa claus at that time he said 
he tended to be in all shapes and sizes 
nast as a 21yearold artist at harpers weekly in 1863 drew a 
short fat bearded santa bringing gifts to union troops in a 
starspangled jacket a cap and striped pants robertson said 
the drawing boosted the spirits of soldiers and civilians alike 
because it showed the spirit of christmas had come to the civil 
war the professor said 
nast was influenced by clement moore whose 1823 poem twas the 
night before christmas depicted a twinklyeyed whitehaired santa 
smoking a pipe the professor said 
almost every year after nast drew a similar santa hence the 
american santa claus took shape by repetition we just became 
accustomed to this same figure robertson said 
one aspect of nasts santa claus did not make it to the 20th 
century nast always put a sprig of mistletoe on his cap 
robertson said

six nuclear power projects have been halted in the 
soviet union because of earthquake danger or tougher standards 
imposed after the chernobyl accident the nuclear power minister 
said friday 
official media has reported cancellation of several projects 
because of growing public opposition after the chernobyl disaster 
but the list provided at a news conference by nikolai lukonin 
minister of the nuclear power industry was the first comprehensive 
report on the state of the soviet nuclear power industry 
cancellations were partly due to highly seismic areas and the 
second reason were changes in regulations and norms of building 
power plants lukonin said 
he said projects had been scrapped in azerbaijan minsk 
byelorussia odessa and krasnodar and that additional units to 
existing plants in armenia and georgia had been canceled those 
projects had a combined capacity of 28 million kilowatt hours 
officials also temporarily suspended work on a third reactor in 
the baltic republic of lithuania because of public concern about 
possible environmental damage to a lake and earthquake danger 
lukonin said 
the nuclear plant located near the armenian capital of yerevan is 
built on a geological fault it was shaken but undamaged by the dec 
7 quake that killed an estimated 55000 people in northern armenia 
but premier nikolai i ryzhkov said in yerevan on dec 12 that the 
plant will be closed in two years because of the danger of future 
quakes 
the georgia azerbaijan and krasnodar sites also are located near 
armenia in the earthquakeprone caucasus mountain region of the 
southern soviet union 
the soviet union has 16 nuclear power plants containing 45 
reactors that now produce 127 percent of the countrys electricity 
officials are looking for new sites in more stable areas such as 
karelia in the far north near finland lukonin said 
despite the cancellations planning and construction is 
continuing at 15 other sites and it is impossible to develop 
the soviet economy without further reliance on nuclear power 
lukonin said 
soviet officials have acknowledged a fear of nuclear power among 
citizens since the april 1986 chernobyl accident in the northern 
ukraine that killed at least 31 people and released a cloud of 
radiation that eventually circled the globe 
opposition to nuclear power has brought soviets out on the 
streets of several cities and some residents of kiev are inclined to 
blame unexplained health problems on the chernobyl accident 
lukonin said fears of nuclear power were a major reason officials 
imposed stricter siting and construction requirements after the 
chernobyl accident the soviet union ended production of the 
graphitecooled reactor of the type that failed at chernobyl 
but 15 of those reactors still are operating with modifications 
made after chernobyl 
we have to work more closely with the public we have had 
certain misunderstandings with that in the past lukonin said 
we have less problems when we explain 
officials of the international atomic energy agency which 
conducted the first international inspection of a soviet nuclear 
power plant said they were impressed with its safety features and 
staff but that manufacturers had supplied poor quality equipment 
that needed modification before it was used 
what the team saw in some cases is that the plant had to take 
some equipment that was received and on plant initiative improve 
the quality said morris rosen the director of the agencys 
nuclear safety program 
the director of the ukrainian plant that underwent the inspection 
said he had spent 260 million to improve equipment 
va korovkin director of the plant in the western ukraine city 
of rovno said the equipment was for two older reactors a third 
reactor commissioned during the past two years and a fourth unit 
that is under construction 
agency officials said there was no way to tell from the recently 
completed threeweek inspection of the rovno plant whether similar 
quality problems exist at other soviet plants 
next year they will carry out a similar inspection in gorky 
located east of moscow

a former university of massachusetts 
student who went on a halloween lockgluing spree has been placed on 
probation for five years and has agreed to pay 9800 for damage to 
seven buildings and telephone cables 
kamal hyder 23 from ryadh india was among three students 
charged with causing nearly 16000 worth of damage by injecting a 
liquidsteel substance into the building locks on halloween 1987 
hyder also was accused of cutting telephone cables and other 
vandalism 
his attorney thomas whitney said hyder who did not graduate 
is employed by an engineering firm in texas and is working on 
several significant projects including a computer for the blind that 
can read any style of type 
this case aside i have been doing constructive things hyder 
told northampton district court judge clement ferris he said he had 
received a british award for academic achievement and played his 
sitar in charity concerts 
ive written 200 letters of apology to umass professors and 
apologized in person to people for what happened he said 
hyder told the judge he had learned about gluing locks from a 
codefendant but had come up with his own more efficient way of 
doing it 
i dont see any gain by saddling this man with a record 
ferris said in agreeing to continue the charges without a finding 
for five years like anybody else hes entitled to have made a 
dumb mistake 
charges against a codefendant michael j milbier also were 
continued without a finding when milbier agreed to pay 9800 in 
restitution 
charges against the third student thomas m oconnor were 
dismissed after ferris found that oconnor who was supposed to act 
as a lookout for the other two while the locks were glued had 
second thoughts and fled

one navy fa18 hornet fighter has crashed and 
four others have experienced inflight problems due to a loose fuel 
filler cap according to a report published friday 
the navy news quoted documents obtained under the freedom of 
information act involving a nonfatal crash of an fa18 near 
twentynine palms calif on feb 7 1987 
there have been four previous fa18a fires or potential fires 
resulting from fuel caps being improperly locked to the centerline 
tank or due to some other suspected malfunction of the fuel cap 
according to a navy accident report quoted by navy news 
a navy spokesman lt cmdr craig quigley confirmed that an 
improperly tightened fuel filler cap caused one crash of an fa18 
hornet but he had not seen documents discussing the other four 
incidents 
we have not detected an inherent design flaw with that fuel 
filler cap that would cause us to ground the aircraft or to redsign 
the fuel filler cap quigley said 
we know of one case where a maintenance air crewman improperly 
secured the fuel filler cap prior to the aircraft taking off 
quigley said the cap was ingested by one of the engines and as 
you may suspect wiped out the engine and caused the aircraft to 
crash 
the investigation into that crash showed that the maintenance 
crew of the ff wall street the nations fifthlargest securities firm 
elected not to risk getting its head blown off 
drexel decided to settle the biggest securities fraud case in 
history by paying a record 650 million in fines and restitution and 
pleading guilty to six felonies reversing its longstanding claims 
of innocence 
the battle had already cost the firm nearly 2 billion in 
attorneys fees and lost business 
drexel also agreed to cooperate with giulianis expanding probes 
into financial trading abuses spawned largely by the downfall of 
ivan f boesky the convicted speculator who fingered drexel and 
others more than two years ago 
the decision came moments before a deadline set by giuliani to 
drexel following weeks of bluffs counterbluffs and leaks to the 
newspapers that a climax was imminent 
postmortem accounts of this historic showdown reveal giuliani 
told drexels directors he was going to make an announcement at 4 
pm wednesday 
he said its going to be either an indictment or a 
settlement you decide said one source familiar with the final 
predeadline maneuvering who requested anonymity it was a game 
of blink and drexel blinked 
the biggest weapon in giulianis arsenal was his threat to 
subject drexel to the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations 
act commonly known as rico a widely feared farreaching statute 
originally designed to combat drug runners gangsters and pimps 
if drexel had been indicted under that act the government could 
have frozen much of its assets and seized what prosecutors had 
reason to believe were the firms illgotten gains before trial to 
hold as security 
individuals named in the indictment would have been forced to 
surrender their earnings during the period of alleged wrongdoing a 
trial could have taken months or even years diverting time energy 
and money from a firm that has prided itself on efficiency 
aggressiveness and big profits 
moreover convictions would have exposed drexel to multiple civil 
lawsuits that could have resulted in many hundreds of millions of 
dollars in fines because of the racketeering acts provision for 
triple damages to victims 
a racketeering indictment would have come at the worst possible 
time for drexel which has been playing crucial financing roles in 
nearly every multibilliondollar takeover of the year most notably 
a 5 billion bridge loan for kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos 245 
billion acquisition of rjr nabisco inc 
drexel executives were known to be anxious to protect their 
interest in that deal which could net as much as 300 million in 
fees 
only a few weeks before giulianis drexel deadline the 
prosecutor had demonstrated vividly to the firm just how powerful 
the racketeering act can be 
the small new jersey investment partnership princeton newport 
partners liquidated because five of its principals and a former 
drexel trader had been indicted under the statute in august by a 
giulianidirected grand jury 
the majority of drexels directors decided not to risk a similar 
fate and opted instead for a settlement that would label the firm a 
felon but at least put the investigation behind it for good 
in other economic and business news this past week 
british conglomerate grand metropolitan plc acquired pillsbury 
co for 568 billion ending the minneapolisbased food and 
restaurant concerns feeble effort to thwart the takeover largely 
by relying on its poisonpill shareholder rights defense grand 
mets triumph raised new questions about the effectiveness of poison 
pills which have been repeatedly challenged in court 
government figures presented more mixed evidence of the 
economys health inflation eased slightly in november while 
consumer spending and orders for large durable goods rose for the 
third quarter of the year the broadest measure of economic growth 
was 25 percent down slightly from an earlier estimate of 26 
percent none of the figures pointed decisively to a slowdown or an 
overheated economy but there was speculation that the federal 
reserve would move soon to hike interest rates if it viewed 
inflation as a threat 
the big three automakers said vehicle sales jumped 153 percent 
during the middecember period paced by a 359 percent leap in ford 
motor co car sales the performance reflected a major improvement 
over the same time a year earlier when consumers spooked by the 
october 1987 stock market crash cut back on spending for expensive 
items

rep bud shuster says it was a legitimate 
public works project that led him to the virgin islands last week 
but congressional sources said things seemed to happen in the 
reverse order that the pennsylvania republican wanted to go the 
islands and dispatched aides to find a reason for the government to 
send him there 
shuster toured an airport construction project before leaving st 
thomas island on wednesday following a fourday stay 
shuster a member of the house public works and transportation 
committee had his trip to the island of st thomas approved 
without compunctions by rep glenn anderson dcalif the 
panels chairman according to committee aide paul schlesinger 
the airport tour came after public works staff members had looked 
into other projects for shuster to inspect in the virgin islands 
including one on st croix according to congressional aides who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
while he was in the virgin islands shusters top aides refused 
to disclose his whereabouts 
were going to take this back to the voters he did nothing 
wrong shuster administrative assistant ann eppard said friday 
she said the congressman knew nothing about staff members shopping 
around for projects and that if they did that then it was not 
initiated by the congressman 
she said shuster was unavailable for an comment friday 
interviewed by telephone thursday from his rural central 
pennsylvania district shuster denied that the committee was paying 
for the entire trip he said the tour of the airport was an 
official trip and the committee pays for my airfare back i spent 
my own money staying 
shuster said the virgin islands trip represented a couple days 
off and that its none of your goddamned business what i do in 
my personal time 
schlesinger the committee aide said he was not aware that 
shuster had arranged to pay part of the cost 
but eppard said shuster got only a oneday per diem and a 
oneway plane ticket 
like other committees the house panel is free to sponsor its 
members on factfinding missions around the world shuster tacked 
the virgin islands trip onto the end of a factfinding trip to 
panama nicaragua el salvador and honduras that he had taken with 
three other house members of the permanent select committee on 
intelligence 
shuster said he arrived in the virgin islands on dec 17 the day 
after the intelligence committee concluded its factfinding mission 
asked why shuster did not return home with the others rep bob 
livingston rla said he had other business to tend to 
shuster the secondranking republican on the public works panel 
and a member of the subcommittee on aviation inspected the cyril e 
king airport in st thomas on the same day as his trip home 
according to officials of the virgin islands port authority 
this is construction of a completely new airport on an existing 
airport a lot of money has been appropriated for this project and 
he wanted to understand what was being done and how far it had 
progressed said john harding executive director of the port 
authority 
shuster termed it a legitimate public works inspection he 
said there has been a major cost overrun and the federal aviation 
administration had cited the airport as being among the most 
dangerous 
faa spokeswoman joann sloane said in an interview friday from 
what i can find out its not dangerous but they have a short 
runway theres a mountain on one side and water and other and 
theyre building the new runway out into where the water is 
shuster said aides did not disclose his trip because there was a 
rule in his office not to reveal his itinerary for security reasons 
asked about shusters whereabouts earlier this week while he was 
in the virgin islands aide karen schecter had pointed to a wire 
service photograph appearing in a pennsylvania newspaper on dec 15 
six days earlier showing the congressman in managua nicaragua 
the conservative shuster 56 was just elected to his ninth term 
in september he was presented with his tenth golden bulldog award 
by a private nonpartisan group which presents awards for fiscal 
integrity

of the rescue operation said friday he remains worried the mammal 
will die in the cold

to do so by the federal government which has authority over rescue 
attempts

robbers preying on southeast asian immigrants 
have held up at least a dozen people in the last week and police 
and community leaders are warning asians to be careful and not carry 
a lot of money 
in one robbery a hmong woman lost a purse containing 5500 
the word is out that they carry money police capt carl 
johnson said 
the facts speak for themselves said st paul police 
spokesman paul adlemann these people are definitely being 
targeted 
two men arrested in the holdup wednesday of two hmong women in 
north minneapolis have been linked by photographs and a stolen car 
to at least one earlier robbery in st paul 
but hours after the two were captured with the help of a hmong 
man armed with a shotgun police said another asian man was robbed 
in north minneapolis 
leaders of the areas southeast asian community have begun 
holding meetings with heads of clans and families warning them of 
the hazards of carrying money and urging them to use banks 
ying vang executive director of the lao family community of 
minnesota said the group contacted 60 hmong leaders and asked that 
they call emergency meetings to discuss taking extra precautions 
we told them to make sure people are aware of this rash of 
robberies and to watch each other closely and make sure more do not 
happen he said 
southeast asians living in some public housing projects also have 
formed groups to patrol at night he said 
vang cheng nengchu a hmong social worker said i think that 
not everybody in the community is aware of the recent robberies 
yet because of language obstacles 
ying vang said hmong leaders were asked to encourage members of 
the 15000person community one of the nations largest 
concentrations of hmong to use banks he estimated that 20 to 30 
percent do not because of language barriers and unfamiliarity with 
banking systems 
detectives in minneapolis and st paul meanwhile are 
investigating possible links among the dozen robberies and say 
there may be more they dont know of word of the robbers success 
has spread they say through news accounts and word of mouth on the 
street 
we know theres more going on out there and the hmong 
community should know that theyre more vulnerable by virtue of a 
few successful robberies johnson said

the barnes family is spending christmas at a 
friends townhouse while their home is repaired and they are 
rebuilding their lives as well after losing their daughter last 
month in a spate of deadly tornadoes 
we talk about it constantly libby barnes said of the 
twisters that ripped through their community nov 28 killing their 
daughter janet 9 and three other people 
we laugh at things she did we talk about things she did that 
we wish she hadnt done 
janet was a vivacious thirdgrader whose fate her parents walt 
and libby brother chip 19 and sister elizabeth 16 are 
struggling to accept 
im just finding the whole concept of it kind of hard to 
grasp elizabeth said as she and her family discussed their ordeal 
wednesday night 
the family said they are trying to keep janets life in 
perspective and avoid the temptation to think of her as saintly 
she was just like these other two mrs barnes said 
gesturing at chip and elizabeth so when people talk about her 
being superthis or superthat well she did have some really good 
qualities but she was a very normal 9yearold child 
a few days after janets funeral walt barnes spoke at a support 
gathering at a nearby elementary school 
the point i tried to make is that the weather has been around 
this planet four and a half billion years and we have been here a 
relatively short time barnes said and sometimes we get in the 
way of the weather or the elements or the environment its not 
something thats sent upon us we wanted very much for the children 
to understand that 
the family has been touched by the outpouring of support from 
government and private agencies their church walt barnes 
colleagues at the state department of agriculture janets school 
and dozens of individuals many of whom they hadnt met before 
one couple ray and elizabeth martin offered the barneses the 
use of the townhouse and stocked it with food repair work has 
started on their north raleigh house to which the family is 
determined to return 
at first we werent sure we wanted to do that barnes said 
but they decided not to let one night of horror overshadow the happy 
years spent there other families are going back and thatll be 
one of the tightest neighborhoods in this town barnes said 
chip said the restored house would be almost identical to the 
original it kind of symbolizes the family a few changes but 
were still going on not trying to freeze time he said

the parliament on friday approved bills to 
encourge private ownership and foreign investment in an attempt to 
reverse four decades of state economic control 
the communist government pushed the two pieces of legislation 
which become law jan 1 to radically alter the structure of 
polands socialist economy 
polands 460member sejm or parliament unanimously approved the 
new law on economic activity which eliminates limits on the size of 
businesses that can be privately owned there were two abstentions 
the foreign investment bill drew two no votes and six 
abstentions the official pap news agency reported 
private business now accounts for about 6 percent of polands 
nonfarm economy but industry minister mieczyslaw wilczek calling 
the bills passage a historic breakthrough has said he hopes 
thousands of new businesses will open next year 
the new law on economic activity removes past discrimination 
against private ownership treating stateowned cooperative and 
private businesses the same for legal purposes 
private businesses previously were limited in size to 50 
employees and needed permission from administrative officials to 
operate businesses could be turned down if a local official deemed 
them unneeded or said they interfered with an existing state or 
cooperative monopoly 
but the new law removes any ceiling on the size of the work force 
and allows individuals cooperatives partnerships and limited 
liability companies to start and operate businesses as long as they 
comply with safety environmental and fire protection laws 
however 11 areas of activity such as weapons manufacture 
production and sales of pharmaceuticals and alcohol or operation of 
sea and air transport will require prior government licenses 
because they involve public safety 
firms are freed from the previous obligation to associate with 
industrial or professional groups 
despite the governments high hopes for the legislation there 
were some doubts 
to be able to invest in something one has to have 
something to invest said an article sunday in the weekly magazine 
wprost the majority of polish families spend their earnings on 
current consumption and cannot afford to start businesses 
only richer citizens have now gained an opportunity to show 
what they can do the article concludes 
the law on foreign investment combines and replaces two old laws 
one for investment by foreigners of polish descent and one for 
everyone else in both cases the rules are now easier 
a foreign investor must put up at least 20 percent of the 
startup cost of any business or joint venture and the business 
will be subject to a 40 percent income tax lower if the company 
produces for export 
unlike previous laws there are no requirements that majority 
control and local management be polish 
companies will have access to currency auctions where they can 
convert profits earned in zlotys to hard currency at market rates 
they also will be allowed to sell to poles in hard currency 
poland passed a foreigninvestment bill in 1986 but businesses 
considered its terms so unattractive that only about a dozen 
companies took advantage of it 
authorities hope that polands low wage scale and skilled work 
force will attract manufacturing and service facilities to serve 
other european countries 
the deputy prime minister ireneusz sekula presented the 
legislation to parliament thursday saying the laws would become the 
basis for freedom equality and competition in the economy 
departing from orthodox communist assumptions of an equal share 
in the wealth for all citizens he defined the states duty only as 
creating equal opportunity 
further possibilities should depend on peoples individual 
achievements he said this is the only way one should 
understand justice 
parliamentarian lucien stepien said that in the context of 
decades of stalinist governing the new laws might seem 
revolutionary 
but in reality he said they are just an attempt to get back 
to normal

a 23foot brydes whale rescued from the 
gulf of mexico has responded to antibiotics and gained 175 pounds 
since last months stranding scientists said 
they hope to return the 2yearold mammal to the gulf in january 
sea world research biologist dan odell says he knows of no other 
case in which a brydes whale survived a stranding and was returned 
to natural habitat 
we got lucky he said watching the twoton mammal floating 
in a pool at the marine attraction thursday 
a boater discovered the whale nov 25 in shallow water off 
honeymoon island near clearwater during a daylong rescue it was 
towed to shore hoisted by crane into a truck and transported to sea 
world 100 miles east 
brydes whales which grow to 40 feet are usually found in water 
more than 100 feet deep scientists dont know why the whale beached 
blood tests showed a generalized infection which is responding to 
antibiotics and with huge doses of vitamins and 105000 calories 
daily in herring gruel and highcalorie liquids the whale has 
steadily improved 
at sea world the whale is hoisted out of the pool and tube fed 
a process that takes about 20 minutes while it is being tube fed 
workers coat its back with a zinc oxide to prevent sunburn and dress 
cuts 
experts are uncertain whether the whale will resume normal 
feeding patterns once returned to the sea they hope to transport it 
75 miles out and attach a radio transmitter to track it

president reagan on friday mourned the victims 
of the crash of pan am flight 103 and insisted it would have been an 
impossible thing to do to warn the american public about all 
threats against commercial airliners 
reagan and his wife nancy then flew across the country for a 
holiday stay at his soontobe retirement home in an exclusive los 
angeles neighborhood after the president made his remarks in 
washington 
the president leaving the white house for his twoweek 
california vacation also asked americans to say a special 
prayer this christmas for the families and friends of those aboard 
the plane and those killed on the ground at lockerbie scotland on 
wednesday some 280 people perished 
i want to express our sorrow and concern to the families and 
friends of those who died in the pan am crash there are 
difficult aspects of this tragedy but none so compelling as the 
anguish of those families who will not have their loved ones with 
them this christmas season reagan said as his wife stood beside 
him in the rain in washington 
the president noted that some three dozen students from syracuse 
university lost their lives in the fiery crash calling them young 
people who carried the twin promises of hopes and dreams 
the tragedy that steals the hopes and dreams from our society 
magnifies the loss to our society he said 
a reporter asked reagan whether all us citizens and not just 
diplomats should have been warned about a dec 5 telephoned threat 
of terrorist attack against a pan am flight from frankfurt 
all the precautions that could be taken were taken with regard 
to warning the airline and all he replied 
of a possible public warning the president added i think that 
would have been a virtually impossible thing to do on the basis of 
that telephone call 
if you stop to think about it such a public statement with 
nothing but a telephone call to go on would literally have closed 
down all the air traffic in the world he said 
asked whether he had any new information as to whether the pan am 
jumbo jet was the target of a terrorist bomb he repliednone of 
this is established the search still goes on we have no knowledge 
about how the accident happened were still trying to find out 
phyllis oakley a state department spokeswoman said thursday 
that an unidentified person telephoned the us embassy in helsinki 
on dec 5 and said there would be a bombing attempt within two weeks 
against a pan am aircraft flying from frankfurt to the united states 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727 with 
passengers and luggage switched to a boeing 747 in london for 
continuation of the trip to new york 
the reagans flew to california aboard air force one to celebrate 
christmas in their new home in the posh bel air section of los 
angeles and bring in the new year at the estate of multimillionaire 
publisher walter annenberg in rancho mirage near palm springs 
mrs reagan took the president on a tour of the home after a 
motorcade from los angeles international airport he exclaimed i 
am awed and i love it according to assistant white house press 
secretary mark weinberg 
it was reagans second visit to the house according to the first 
lady she has said she sneaked him out of their hotel on a previous 
trip to los angeles and had him crouch on the floor of a white house 
car to escape the attention of reporters 
the president who has spent 444 days in his home state since 
taking office in january 1981 will return to the white house on 
jan 5 after he leaves office jan 20 he and the first lady will 
move to bel air

the arresting officers it got stuck on some clothing thank god 
it did 
the gun was fully loaded with 20 rounds of 9mm ammunition

they saw him talking to a second man and when they asked about 
him mcallister said theres a guy out there with a gun and hes 
going to kill everybody according to terribile

the suspect identified as chidiakl knight was fighting to get 
past other people on the escalator while attempting to try and

jurors in the bess myerson divorcefixing trial 
voted 93 in favor of conviction early on but finally decided the 
prosecutions case wasnt strong enough the panels forewoman said 
when we looked the other way and presumed innocence it forced 
us to realize that the prosecutions evidence didnt bear out 
said linda berardi the forewoman in the 12week trial in us 
district court 
there was some feeling among us that something did happen but 
it wasnt borne out by the prosecution said nelson marty another 
juror 
late thursday the jury acquitted the former miss america her 
lover carl andy capasso and retired judge hortense gabel on 
charges they conspired to lower capassos alimony payments in return 
for a 19000ayear city job for the judges downandout daughter 
sukhreet mrs gabel was handling the capasso divorce case 
the jury deliberated for four days before clearing the three on 
all six counts of conspiracy mail fraud bribery and obstruction of 
justice 
sukhreet gabels dramatic comical and often contradictory 
testimony as the prosecutions star witness wound up hurting the 
governments case michael feldberg who represented her 76yearold 
mother said friday 
i think the prosecution would have been better off if they 
didnt call her he said at a news conference i dont think 
they would have won anyway but i think they would have been better 
off without her because she turned the case into daytime television 
which is something far different than criminal law 
if us attorney rudolph giuliani had taken the time to 
scrutinize what would happen to sukhreet gabel on crossexamination 
he may have had second third or perhaps fourth thoughts about 
bringing this case feldberg said 
the real question in this case it seems to me is not whether 
sukhreet gabel is a troubled person obviously she has her 
difficulties he added the real question is why prosecutors who 
know these difficulties would prey upon them and use this young 
woman to make a case against her mother 
he said myersons fame as a mover and shaker she was the citys 
cultural affairs commissioner may have led the us attorneys 
office to bring the charges 
theres a mentality that a lot of prosecutors have of if the 
target is prominent it helps you in deciding you want to bring a 
case feldberg said and in this case they had the most 
prominent public woman in new york as a target 
myerson who mayor edward i koch credits with helping him win 
his job 12 years ago said after the verdict that she was grateful 
for the american judicial system and thanked the jury for 
exonerating her 
she was not available for interviews on friday said her 
attorney fred hafetz i think shes just resting up a little bit 
recouping from the trial 
mrs gabel said that in her 19 years as a judge the trial was 
the best judicial experience ive had 
capasso who is serving a sentence for tax evasion was returned 
to a pennsylvania prison 
hafetz said he didnt know myersons immediate plans he said the 
trial generated a lot of bad publicity for her but added 
hopefully this verdict a clear verdict vindicating her will 
restore her to a position where she is going to be able to make a 
significant contribution to our lives 
shes been through hell i wish her only well the mayor 
said friday i believe our 25 years of friendship will continue 
said koch who denounced her as a friend after an investigation he 
ordered blasted myerson for hiring ms gabel 
the mayors offer of friendship did not extend to a job offer 
asked if he would invite her to rejoin his administration koch 
said i think thats over with i think she has new fields to 
conquer

motion made dec 13 that president hafez assad of syria and nabih 
berri leader of the shiite moslem militia amal in lebanon be asked 
to testify 
gabriele steckbromme a defense lawyer said at the time she 
wanted assad and berri to be questioned about what she called a 
pledge by us authorities not to prosecute the hijackers if the twa 
airplane hostages were released 
berri was instrumental in negotiating the release and the 
hostages were taken to damascus capital of syria

berri had any meaning in the case and doubted either would come 
if asked 
us officials denied when the hostages were released that any 
deal had been made

a research company has developed a 
smokestack device far more effective than those now in use at 
removing sulfur dioxide the chief cause of acid rain a university 
of texas engineering professor says 
leonardt kreisle said the synergistic reactor developed by 
aerological research systems with help from ut engineering students 
removes virtually all sulfur dioxide from smokestack emissions 
dryair scrubbers now in use are more expensive to make and 
use and remove only 60 percent to 70 percent of the chemical he 
said 
thomas ewan president of aerological research in daingerfield 
said the company has a prototype that can remove 10 pounds a minute 
of sulfur dioxide too little for a power plant but plans to 
build one big enough to remove 5000 pounds of sulfur dioxide a 
minute for power plants and factories 
sulfur dioxide is a byproduct of steel manufacturing refining 
and coal burning it combines with nitrous oxide sunlight and rain 
to form acid the government has said that a solution to the acid 
problem will cost billions of dollars 
the patent application for the device was accepted by the 
government in november ewan said the company is negotiating with 
manufacturers to produce the devices for the market next year 
weve not looked at the price yet he said but it will 
cost a lot less than conventional scrubbers the design is quite 
simple even though the operation is sophisticated 
kreisle said he is not a participant in the patent and has no 
financial stake in the device 
he said it is a fraction of the size of comparable dryair 
scrubbers operates on about a third of the energy acts more 
quickly and leaves only dry gypsum or chalk as a byproduct 
the reactor is housed in a steel tube 24 feet long and 6 inches 
in diameter and is designed to replace the uppermost part of a 
smokestack 
gases formed by burning of coal and other organic materials enter 
a reactor chamber filled with steam and ground lime a resulting 
chemical action removes the sulfur dioxide according to the 
developers

the government announced friday it will 
allow the 5yearold state of emergency to lapse next month hoping 
that sinhalese radicals will stop engaging in violence and join the 
democratic process 
it is our present intention not to extend the emergency when it 
lapses on jan 15 the national security minister lalith 
athulathmudali told a news conference 
he said the government will also consider releasing 2200 
political prisoners and reopening schools and universities closed 
for up to three years due to the violence 
the emergency was imposed in may 1983 in an effort to quell an 
insurgency by minority tamils against the sinhalese majority that 
has left 8500 people dead parliament has extended the emergency 
every month since then giving security forces sweeping powers to 
search homes arrest and detain people without charge and shoot 
violators 
for 17 months the extremist sinhalese group the peoples 
liberation front has waged a campaign to overthrow the government 
saying it conceded too much to the tamils in a 1987 peace accord 
the accord provides for limited autonomy for the tamils and 
places 47000 indian peacekeeping soldiers on sri lankan soil 
the tamils who are mostly hindus complain they have been denied 
jobs and education by the sinhalese who run the government and the 
military 
tamils comprise 18 percent and the predominantly buddhist 
sinhalese make up 75 percent of the islands 16 million people 
prime minister ranasinghe premadasa a sinhalese was elected 
president last monday and called on sinahlese extremists to end the 
violence and join the democratic process parliamentary elections 
are to be held feb 15 
athulathumadali said he did not know whether extremists responded 
to premadasas appeal for peace but added incidents of violence 
appear to be less and there seems to be no clear rejection to the 
open wideangled request for them to come into the political 
mainstream

nearly a year after a polygamist clan began 
a fatal confrontation with the law a jurys verdict has ended 
another chapter in a saga begun 15 years ago on the familys 
northern utah homestead 
the homicide convictions of three young clan members said one 
prosecutor puts to rest the legend of john singer whose 1979 
death at the hands of utah lawmen triggered the bombing of a mormon 
chapel last january and the clans 13day armed standoff at their 
marion farm 
an eightmember 3rd district court jury in coalville on thursday 
convicted clan patriarch addam swapp 27 and singers son john 
timothy singer 22 of manslaughter in the death of state 
corrections lt fred house gunned down during a botched arrest that 
ended the siege 
addams brother jonathan swapp 21 was convicted of negligent 
homicide singer admitted firing the fatal shot and jonathan said he 
also shot his rifle but addam swapp who was seriously wounded by 
an fbi sharpshooter insisted he never fired 
its over said assistant us attorney dave schwendiman who 
also prosecuted the trio and singers widow vickie in federal 
court last spring 
they just simply cant bring john singer out to justify what 
they have done and want to do he said its over and if this 
year hasnt proved that in spades nothing will 
it was 1973 when john singer a german immigrant and 
excommunicated mormon who embraced polygamy and other mormon 
fundamentalist beliefs pulled his children from public schools he 
believed were rife with dangerously liberal teachings 
but the decision to keep the children out of school embroiled him 
in an escalating dispute with the law and in 1979 one of several 
deputies trying to serve an arrest warrant felled him with a shotgun 
blast when he purportedly brandished a pistol 
clan members believe singer was shot in the back as part of a 
conspiracy among lawmen and the mormon church which banned polygamy 
in 1890 
vickie singer kept her six children on the farm although 
singers second wife left in 1980 the farm became home to addam 
swapp also an excommunicated mormon whose married two of mrs 
singers daughters 
the ensuing years brought a series of troubles including feuds 
with neighbors over water rights and an accident that left john 
timothy singer a paraplegic a federal judge dismissed mrs singers 
wrongful death lawsuit in 1987 fueling the familys distrust of 
secular and religious authority 
summit county sheriff fred eley said addam swapp further 
antagonized the community late in last year when he began sending 
fiery letters to state and local officials accusing them of 
murdering singer and containing religious references to bloodshed 
and destruction eley obtained an arrest warrant after swapp fired a 
gun into the air when eley went to the farm to talk to him 
swapp remained holed up on the farm until the night of jan 16 
when he planted 87 sticks of dynamite in the chapel an act he said 
was a divinely inspired signal for singers resurrection and the 
fall of a corrupt church and state it was the bombing of the chapel 
that touched off the siege that ended in houses death 
john singer never would have blown up a church or done anything 
like that eley said i could see where john was coming from 
and i saw addam as nothing more than a terrorist 
sentincing on the state convictions was set for jan 20 
addam swapp faces a sentence of five years to life as does john 
timothy singer jonathan swapp faces a maximum of a year in jail 
the three already have received federal sentences of 10 or 15 years 
for the bombing convictions mrs singer is serving a fiveyear 
federal term she was not charged in state court 
swapp who wept as he held two of his sons after the trial did 
not make a public statement after thursdays verdicts but his elder 
wife heidi said she still believes in her husbands cause and in 
his innocence 
this is in gods hands she said only god knows the 
truth 
the singerswapp family remains on the farm in marion said 
swapps attorney bill morrison the family has been peaceful but 
eley said their neighbors still keep watch for any unusual activity 
how long it will last i dont know eley said i hope its 
over and maybe they do too maybe theyve been through enough

36th district court judge r patrick donahue said thursday in

then when six of the officers left the remaining two made him 
eat the crack he testified at a twoweek preliminary hearing 
the eight are also accused of breaking into another home also 
suspected to be a crack house the same night and assaulting its 
occupants 
johnson 26 said he had sold 100 worth of crack cocaine the 
night of feb 20 and had cash and 20 bags of crack on a living room 
table when police with drawn guns came in 
another witness who was in an apartment across the hall from 
johnson testified to overhearing someone say eat this if 
you dont ill take you to jail followed by laughter 
wayne county prosecutors say johnson may have saved his life 
after police left by drinking vinegar to induce vomiting he was 
treated for a cocaine overdose at detroit receiving hospital 
a trial date was not set but arraignment was scheduled for jan 
13 in recorders court 
the officers free on 10000 personal bonds left the raids out 
of their reports and logs a violation of department policy

follow the law just like everybody else said wayne county

the cockpit recording of pan am flight 
103s final minutes ended with a brief mysterious faint noise 
and gave no sign that the pilots knew their boeing 747 was doomed 
investigators said friday 
conversations captured by the black box that records all 
cockpit activity was normal up to the faint noise at the end which 
needs a bit more analysis said paul mckie a department of 
transport spokesman 
mick charles of the departments air accident investigation 
branch who is heading a team of 40 us and british investigators 
at the crash site said we have no evidence whatsoever yet of 
sabotage 
the plane flying from london to new york broke up at 31000 
feet wednesday night killing all 258 people aboard and bombarding 
the scottish countryside with flaming wreckage over a 10mile radius 
flowers arrived at the scene friday a passenger who had left the 
flight at london sent a bouquet to a child flying on to new york 
with the message to the little girl in the red dress who lies 
here who made my flight from frankfurt such fun you didnt deserve 
this 
suspicions of sabotage were prompted by the inexplicable sudden 
breakup of the plane a claim of responsibility and disclosures that 
the us government had been warned of a plot to bomb a pan am 
flight between frankfurt and new york in december 
flight 103 originated in frankfurt with a boeing 727 and 
switched to a boeing 747 from londons heathrow airport 
soldiers hacked open the nose section lying on its side in a 
field and removed the bodies of crew members on stretchers and 
under tarpaulins 
from 20 to 30 relatives of victims arrived in lockerbie the 
scottish village that bore the brunt of the crash and 155 bodies 
were placed in makeshift morgues in the town hall and ice rink 
the relatives included at least seven americans they were 
advised against visiting the wreckage said superintendent angus 
kennedy a police spokesman in lockerbie 
more than 600 police and military personnel spent friday scouring 
the countryside for bodies and wreckage but only one more body was 
found kennedy said whether it was of a passenger or ground victim 
was not known 
fourteen adults and three children were missing in the lockerbie 
area and there was no word on the occupants of three cars hit by 
wreckage and gutted on a nearby highway kennedy said 
he said it had been learned the driver of a fourth car was 
treated for injuries wednesday night and released and the driver of 
a fifth car was a villager and counted among the 17 residents listed 
as missing 
arc lights and heavy lifting equipment were brought in to speed 
the search searchers moved shoulder to shoulder across fields and 
marshes trying to collect every scrap of evidence 
a faint smell of aviation fuel lingered 
during the night a party of jewish youths clambered over the 
rubble apparently searching for holy items like prayer books that 
might have been with jewish passengers and require ritual burial 
all indications were that the plane broke up in seconds and that 
the cockpit never knew of the imminent catastrophe 
there were no abnormal noises on the cockpit recorders tape 
until the signals ended abruptly with the aircraft cruising at 
31000 feet said mckie 
there was nothing in the conversations to indicate anything was 
wrong he said adding that no conclusions could be drawn yet from 
the noise at the end of the tape 
on thursday transport secretary paul channon said the planes 
radar blip on the scottish ground control screens split into 
several returns before vanishing 
charles told a news conference the wreckage was spread over a 
very very long wreckage trail but added this did not indicate 
sabotage the spread was normal given the planes altitude and the 
115knot winds at 31000 feet 
people have found papers clothing and mail up to 70 miles from 
lockerbie three teenage boys found a bundle of 500000 in 
travelers checks in the hills near their home six miles from 
lockerbie police said friday 
to try and prejudge this case would be totally wrong there are 
obviously a number of potential causes for an inflight breakup we 
are looking for evidence to try and point us in the right direction 
to suggest that it would be one or the other at this stage would be 
wrong charles said 
president reagan sent a message to the 2500 people of lockerbie 
saying our hearts go out to you on this tragic occasion which 
marred what should have been a season of joy 
frank park of the local district council wrote back our small 
community has suffered much but our sadness is even greater when we 
think of the loss of so many people from the united states our 
thoughts are with their friends and relatives wherever they may be 
a newspaper friday quoted a security source as saying 
investigators were taking very seriously a groups claim of 
responsibility 
the independent quoted the source as saying the group is thought 
to have sought revenge for the july 3 downing of an iranian jetliner 
by a us warship in the persian gulf 
an anonymous caller to the associated press in london claimed 
thursday the guardians of the islamic revolution was responsible for 
the crash 
a political dispute arose over the transport departments 
disclosure that it knew of a bomb threat two weeks before the crash 
but did not pass it on to heathrow or the public 
us officials told british officials that an anonymous caller to 
the us embassy in helsinki finland said dec 5 that a bomb would 
be planted aboard a pan am flight from frankfurt to the united 
states within two weeks 
transport minister michael portillo said it was confidential 
classified us intelligence information and we didnt have the 
right to divulge it 
he said the warning prompted an assessment of heathrow security 
for us flights the security was judged to be appropriate 
also on friday 
an air india jumbo jet bound for new york with 250 people aboard 
returned to london after air india in new york received an anonymous 
bomb threat officials said the plane was evacuated at heathrow but 
the airline said nothing suspicious was found 
an unattended suitcase found at heathrow forced hundreds of 
christmas travelers to evacuate one of four terminals for nearly an 
hour but it was found to contain only clothing officials said 
a british airways tristar arrived at heathrow after making a 
10hour unscheduled stop in rome because of a bomb threat

the former chairman of dartmouths board 
of trustees said friday that he did not influence a disciplinary 
panel that suspended two student journalists although he was unhappy 
with their publication 
at a court hearing to determine whether the two stdents should be 
reinstated norman mcculloch testified his initial reaction to the 
offcampus conservative dartmouth review was favorable 
i thought it was extremely important to have a conservative 
viewpoint demonstrated and published on campus mcculloch said in 
grafton county superior court but i became really disenchanted 
when the review began to go away from a focus on the issues and 
began to focus on personalities 
mcculloch said however that he did not try to influence the 
campuswide disciplinary board that suspended former review editors 
christopher baldwin and john sutter for 18 months in march 
baldwin 21 of hinsdale ill and sutter 22 of st louis want 
judge bruce mohl to let them return to school before their 
suspensions expire in september mohl is expected to rule before 
classes resume jan 3 
they and two other students were accused of harassing music 
professor william cole during a classroom confrontation after a 
review article disparaged coles course 
cole who is black once was described by the review as looking 
like a used brillo pad he testified this week that he 
considered the latest review criticisms racially motivated a charge 
denied by sutter and baldwin 
the hearing ended friday after the judge prevented the schools 
lawyer from trying to show that the former editors sought a heavy 
penalty in order to generate more publicity for their case 
mohl ruled as irrelevant an attempt by dartmouth lawyer james 
middleton to show that baldwin and sutter intentionally sought the 
18month suspension 
middleton argued it was extremely relevant because it was 
important to get a maximum suspension and therefore to get maximum 
press exposure 
the students lawyer harvey myerson disputed middletons claim 
calling it one of the most extraordinary things ive ever heard 
when the hearing began monday myerson said the suspensions had 
national implications because of their chilling effect on college 
journalists nationwide but mohl also called that argument 
irrelevant 
the two students argue that dartmouth discriminates against 
conservatives disciplining them for infractions more harshly than 
liberal students a charge college officials deny two lawsuits one 
in state and one in federal court have been filed against the 
school based on this allegation

while there may be no quick answers to the 
tragedy of pan am flight 103 the wreckage scattered across the 
scottish countryside has left enough clues to make it virtually 
certain the cause will be found aviation experts said friday 
as more information surfaced specialists noted the similarities 
between wednesdays crash of the boeing 747 in scotland that killed 
all 258 people aboard and leaving at least 17 people missing on the 
ground and the crash three years ago of an air india jumbo jet off 
the irish coast 
indian officials after months of retrieving wreckage from the 
ocean floor concluded that a bomb exploded aboard the air india 
jetliner an explosion is widely believed to have caused the pan am 
plane to crash although no conclusive evidence of a bombing has yet 
surfaced 
both the pan am and air india planes were cruising routinely at 
31000 feet and suddenly disappeared from radar in neither case did 
the flight crew declare an emergency or make any radio contact with 
air traffic control in both cases the planes broke up in the air 
scattering wreckage over five or more miles 
in both crashes the recording from the cockpit gave no 
indication the pilots were aware of any unusual but contained a 
muffled sound in the final split second of tape 
that sound became crucial in the air india investigation the 
final report on the accident concluded from the sounds found 
recorded on the cvr cockpit voice recorder and the air traffic 
control tapes it appears that an explosion had occurred on board 
the aircraft 
authorities in scotland announced friday that a preliminary 
review of the cvr tape from pan am flight 103 also ends with a 
muffled sound a fraction of a second before the recorder went dead 
there is nothing in the conversation of the pilots to 
indicate anything was wrong said a british spokesman reminiscent 
of the air india findings 
paul mckie spokesman for the department of transport cautioned 
that further analysis will be required before it can be determined 
what the noise might be and warned not to jump to any 
conclusions 
more sophisticated spectrographic examination of the tape likely 
will provide a better clue as to whether the sound is an explosion 
from a bomb or a breakup of the aircraft because of a sudden 
decompression similar sounds have been heard on cvr taps in other 
accidents when aircraft experienced major structural failures 
officials said 
us aviation experts including several who have been involved 
in investigating scores of air disasters are confident the answers 
will be found 
it will be a massive job to reconstruct the pieces said 
ronald schleede chief of aviation accident investigation at the 
national transportation safety board but theyre going to solve 
it because the evidence will be there 
we will know what brought down pan am 103 faa administrator 
allan mcartor said but he cautioned it could take months 
neither mcartor nor schleede who has been briefed daily by 
telephone by ntsb officials at the crash site would discuss 
specifically the pan am findings so far 
but schleede and other experts noted in interviews that the pam 
am crash investigators have some advantages 
for example 
while the crash caused an inferno in the small scottish farming 
town of lockerbie destroying a row of houses most of the aircraft 
with the exception of a destroyed right wing whose fuel tank 
exploded appeared to have escaped serious fire damage 
in many crashes where a plane remains intact and burst into 
flames critical clues are lost because of the intense heat that 
bends metal and destroys evidence 
the wreckage although strewn across the countryside is not 
as was the case of air india in hundreds of feet of water and 
exposed to elements that could destroy critical evidence 
the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder appear to be 
in good shape 
in the coming days investigators will pay close attention to how 
parts of the aircraft are bent tangled and singed and whether there 
is evidence of a chemical residue normally left by an explosive 
they also will search for fragments that might have been used as 
a detonator and closely examine luggage and parts of luggage as well 
as aircraft wreckage holes left by flying fragments such holes 
leave a distinctive pattern if caused by an explosion one expert 
said 
some of the wreckage will be reassembled as closely as possible 
to the original aircraft and metallurgists will try to determine how 
the pieces broke apart was it from metal fatigue or from being torn 
apart which part of an aircraft broke first did the pieces break 
apart along specific seams of the aircrafts skin 
the flight data recorder which monitors the performance of the 
aircraft and the cockpit voice recorder will be examined and their 
times coordinated a key question is whether all of the planes 
electrical systems were knocked out simultaneously one veteran 
investigator said 
it is known that pan am flight 103 in rapid order lost its radar 
transponder radio contact and both flight and cockpit voice 
recorders this investigator said 
if all of these functions failed simultaneously there is strong 
evidence of a massive electrical failure possibly cause by an 
explosion near the forward baggage compartment which is adjacent to 
the electrical and computer systems on the boeing 747 experts 
suggested

paul channon the british 
transportation secretary arrived in barbados for a caribbean 
vacation friday his department is in charge of investigating the 
pan am crash in scotland 
britains opposition labor party said it was unbelievable of 
channon to take a holiday during the investigation into britains 
worst aviation disaster 
the jumbo jet broke up in the air wednesday night and crashed 
into the village of lockerbie killing all 258 people aboard 
channon and his wife ingrid were met on the tarmac by the airport 
manager and walked directly to the arrival hall making no comment 
he was seen checking in with mustique airways and was believed to 
be flying to the tiny island about 40 miles away mustique in the 
grenadines chain is a popular getaway isle for such famous people 
as mick jagger and princess margaret sister of queen of elizabeth 
ii 
the british embassy in barbados said it had no information on 
channons visit because he was not on official business 
in london the trade ministry said he would be kept informed on 
the investigation and planned to return soon after christmas but 
would fly home earlier if necessary 
john prescott the labor party transport spokesman on 
transportation said it is unbelievable it is quite intolerable 
and totally insensitive for the transport secretary to leave for his 
holidays so soon after britains worst aviation disaster when 
bodies are still being retrieved and a major security review is 
under way 
prescott said margaret thatcher the conservative prime minister 
should call him back immediately and declared such lack of 
judgment should justify his removal 
geoffrey dickens a conservative member of parliament said labor 
was trying to make capital out of other peoples misery and

speculation that an explosion may have caused a 
pan american world airways jet to crash in scotland has prompted the 
federal aviation administration to issue a call for increased 
security at airports worldwide officials said friday 
faa administrator allan mcartor told reporters that the security 
alert was sent to airlines foreign governments and major airports 
both in the united states and abroad on thursday 
he said it was prompted by a combination of factors including 
the pan am crash wednesday the heavy christmas travel rush and 
what obviously can be considered a heightening of world tensions 
as it pertains to terrorist activities 
the alert was not prompted by any single threat or piece of 
intelligence information officials said 
mcartor in an interview with a small group of reporters 
declined to discuss specifically the pan am crash that killed all 
258 people aboard a boeing 747 jumbo jet and leaving at least 17 
people missing on the ground the plane apparently broke apart in 
the air possibly because of a terrorist bomb 
the crash came two weeks after the faa sent the state department 
a bulletin warning that pan am might be the subject of a terrorist 
bombing on its flights from frankfurt west germany the boeing 747 
that crashed was flight 103 which had originated at frankfurt 
disclosure of the faa bulletin in early december the 23rd such 
alert this year has prompted questions over whether such notices 
should be shared with the public 
president reagan said earlier friday that a public warning based 
on an anonymous telephone call as was the case with the alert 
involving pan am would have been an overreaction it would 
literally have closed down air traffic in the world reagan said 
in answer to a reporters question 
mcartor praised pan ams response to the alert at the frankfurt 
airport saying the airline had imposed a very heightened level of 
security he said pan ams precautions at londons heathrow 
airport from which flight 103 departed 54 minutes before the crash 
were still under review 
at frankfurt mcartor said pan am briefed gate personnel about 
the possible threat kept ground baggage handlers and caterers 
under constant surveillance and checked all luggage by xray 
instead of only at random all passengers and their bags also were 
matched prior to boarding he said 
mcartor said that while there is no hard evidence of sabotage in 
connection with flight 103 he is concerned about the possibility 
that a bomb could be placed aboard the jetliner at two airports 
where security precautions are among the best in the world and where 
a heightened alert was in effect 
if there was a door of opportunity for terrorists left open 
weve got to find out what allowed that and close that door he 
said

presidentelect george bush has written 
president daniel ortega saying he wants to work toward strengthening 
world peace the leftist sandinista government said friday 
the nicaraguan rebels issued their christmas message friday 
vowing not to lay down their arms until there is democracy 
certainly it will be a sad christmas but the near future is filled 
with hope said the contras as the rebels are known 
a statement from ortegas press office said bushs letter was in 
reply to a message of congratulations ortega sent bush on his 
election in november 
the new york times recently quoted ortega as saying he would 
present a peace proposal to bush but insisted any talks with the 
united states center on security issues not nicaraguas internal 
politics 
for the past eight years the united states has pressured the 
sandinistas to undertake democratic reforms and to cut their 
military ties with cuba and the soviet union washington has 
supported the contras since 1981 as part of that campaign 
the sandinistas came to power in a 1979 popular revolution that 
overthrew rightist president anastasio somoza promising to install 
a democratic pluralistic government 
us officials and opposition leaders accused the sandinistas of 
pursuing repressive policies including national emergency laws of 
198087 that imposed press censorship and restricted individual 
freedoms 
in 1981 the reagan administration cut off all economic aid to 
nicaragua 
three years ago it imposed a trade embargo saying nicaragua was 
a beachhead from which to spread communism in central america 
usnicaraguan talks in 1985 to explore ways of improving 
relations ended in deadlock 
fridays statement published by the sandinista newspaper 
barricada under the title message from bush to daniel said 
ortega received the vice presidents letter on thursday 
among other concepts presidentelect bush said he 
enthusiastically looked forward to working to strengthen world 
peace it said 
the contras message read by telephone from the groups offices 
in miami said the rebels will only lay down their arms in 
exchange for a real democracy 
our combatants maintain their discipline and are ready to 
defend the honor of the nation the contra statement said it is 
not nicaraguan to try to impose a slave regime when nicaragua wants 
liberty 
in other developments government technicians speaking on 
condition of anonymity said work on an eastern port that could 
receive huge arms shipments was dealt a serious setback by 
sedimentation from hurricane joan in october 
nicaraguan economists have said the government strapped by a 
severe economic crisis does not have the resources necessary to 
finish the deep water port known as the bluff 
also on friday the progovernment newspaper el nuevo diario said 
the soviet union donated a tu154 jetliner and granted staterun 
aeronica airline credits to buy two an32 passenger planes it put 
the cost of the three airliners at 528 million 
the tu154 can carry 141 pasengers will be used international 
routes the an32s will be used on domestic flights replacing older 
american planes which cannot be serviced due to lack of spare parts 
arising from the us trade embargo

the cigarsmoking samaritan wearing a bright red threepiece 
suit and a crimson fedora said he read about the cadillac santa 
and thought he could do better said clancy imislund spokesman 
for the midnight mission 
the mercedes mans outpouring of altruism followed by a day the 
seventh annual visit to the mission by a secretive philanthropist 
known as the cadillac santa who also shares holiday cheer with 
street dwellers in the form of cold hard cash 
the latest wellheeled santa handed out about 3000 while the 
cadillacdriving benefactor spent about twice as much the cadillac 
santa gave out more largely because the homeless have learned to 
gather and wait for him after seven years 
the mercedes santas warmth made up for his gaudy outfit 
imislund said 
with a red suit red tie and red fedora it was the most 
godawful getup you could imagine but his heart was in the right 
place and nobody cared what he was wearing he said 
he was hohohoing like nobodys business and just like the

bitterness took hold friday among friends and relatives of the 
pan am crash victims over the possibility the tragedy was a 
terrorist attack and many wondered at the coincidences by which 
some people and not others were aboard 
if terrorists are responsible they should kill them who are 
they to take their political problems out on innocent civilians 
said colgate university student chris quinn who lost a fellow 
student in the crash 
the boeing 747 en route to new york from london crashed into a 
scottish hamlet wednesday killing all 258 on board 
the dead included business executives 35 students taking part in 
a syracuse university study abroad program and others coming home 
for the holidays 
nbc news reported that one of the victims was the cias chief of 
station in beirut lebanon but state department spokeswoman sondra 
mccarty said she had no information on any victims being employees 
of the intelligence agency 
three state department employees died in the crash including two 
junior employees assigned as security officers and political 
officer matthew k gannon of orange calif spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley said earlier friday 
gannon assigned to the departments middle east bureau was 
returning home upon completion of assignment in beirut as a 
political officer he had previously worked in north yemen jordan 
and syria mrs oakley said 
calls by the associated press to the cia were not immediately 
returned 
also among the victims were an army navigator heading home for 
the funeral of his sister a soldier flying home to be with his 
father while he awaited surgery and a cabin attendant who planned 
to retire after the flight 
traffic jams a ticket mixup and a final exam that lasted too 
long were among the twists that saved the lives of others who nearly 
took flight 103 
the state department warned us embassies dec 7 of a bomb 
threat against pan am jets out of frankfurt where flight 103 
originated pan am and law enforcement authorities were notified 
but no public warning was issued 
president reagan on friday said a public warning would 
literally have closed down all the air traffic in the world 
i certainly think the public should have been warned they also 
had a responsibility to find out if the threat was true if it was 
true they should not have let anyone get on said genevieve 
walters whose son richard cawley 43 of new york was killed 
to know how she went and to know they might have known 
something like this was going to happen it would make any mother 
mad said barbara matthews weedon of new york who lost a 
20yearold daughter i think it is negligent they should have 
done something about it like checked into it 
mildred sachuck the house mother at a syracuse fraternity that 
lost a member in the crash and another in a beirut terrorist bombing 
in 1983 said that if the crash was the work of terrorists we 
ought to blow em to hell 
among the lucky ones was the four tops singing group which was 
delayed by a british broadcasting co tv taping lead singer levi 
stubbs said he called his wife to tell her he had missed flight 103 
and she was crying and carrying on and i asked whats the 
matter and she told me what happened he said 
flight attendant paul garrett 41 had planned to open a boutique 
in paris after 15 years with the airline the terrible tragedy is 
that this was going to be his last flight said jan macmichael a 
friend in millbrae calif 
paul walters who was flying with his wife and son after serving

in the recent wave of south african theatrical 
productions exposing the oppression of apartheid the most popular 
is the surprisingly exuberant broadway musical sarafina 
television viewers who dont expect to be in new york anytime 
soon can get a taste of the show and a look behind the scenes in an 
nbc news special wednesday sarafina words of freedom songs 
of hope a onehour version of documentary maker nigel nobles 
featurelength film 
the film includes snippets of the incredibly infectious music 
composed by hugh masakela and the playwright mbongeni ngema and 
touching interviews with the talented cast of black south african 
teenagers who tell wrenching tales of repression beatings and 
deaths of loved ones but also express hope for the future 
id seen the play and had always wanted to do something to 
explain what apartheid did to people said nbc news senior 
executive producer paul greenberg cbs did a good show last year 
the documentary children of apartheid but the way these kids 
talk about it and act through the play they explain what happened 
to them in their own lives they describe their hope and after all 
that has happened to them they really want to go back 
the film is a departure for us because there are hardly any 
nbc people just the kids and the music greenberg said connie 
chung appears briefly to explain to viewers what they are about to 
see 
at one point ngema lectures his young charges about their 
mission in america the south african embassy has ambassadors 
here and ambassadors are people who speak for them the black 
people of south africa dont have an embassy here so this is the 
embassy and you are the ambassadors 
the kids have been immensely successful the show opened at 
lincoln center in october 1987 and moved to the cort theater on 
broadway it won rave reviews and has been selling out nightly 
the show is a loose flow of sketches about the lives of students 
at sowetos morris isaacson high school a school that prides itself 
on its political consciousness sarafina is a popular girl and one 
of the student leaders many of the musical numbers are joyous even 
funny but late in the play sarafinas incarceration and torture by 
police unseen gives fire to the other students commitment when 
she returns unbowed there is a climactic dance number in which the 
kids hurl themselves with deadly result at the military figures who 
double as the onstage band 
in an interview cast member dumisani dlamini describes the 
reality that inspired the scene i have seen things happening in 
front of my face i have seen my brothers dying and i have seen my 
heroes dying so how shall i sit down i have to stand and fight 
then ill be free 
theater in south africa at the moment plays a very important 
role says ngema we dont read a lot in the newspaper about 
what is happening in south africa and newspapers outside south 
africa cannot report everything they want to report so theater at 
this point in time has become the only voice left 
ngema recruited the youngsters from black townships and lived 
with the entire cast together in one small house for three months 
he got permission from their parents to take them 8000 miles away 
to new york by promising they would get a good education he 
explains that most south african black children dont attend school 
because the education they receive is poor and schools are subject 
to riots and police sweeps 
most americans probably cannot imagine how children raised under 
crushing oppression could attain broadway fame and still long to 
return to their homeland but the kids do 
i will go back to south africa because its where i belong 
too says dlamini its my home ill die in south africa 
thats what i think 
the climactic moment in the film comes when the children meet 
singer miriam makeba a spiritual leader for them despite her 27 
years in exile they are so overwhelmed by seeing her in person 
they cry and cling to her then break into song she is moved to 
tears 
i may die in exile today but i will die very happy knowing 
that you will continue to do all that i started doing makeba 
says spreading the message through your music and your lovely 
voices to the world telling them and showing them that we are a 
proud people and that we are in fact a struggling people and 
that we will win our independence and well be free like all other 
people in the world

after more than 2000 years the mystery and 
magic surrounding the bible has not abated 
historianarchaeologist john romer examines the bible in a 
sevenpart series for the discovery channel that attempts to 
determine what is fact and what is faith testament the bible and 
history begins wednesday 
a lot of our knowledge is based on academic structure said 
romer an englishman who lives in italy and egypt the trouble is 
that so many of our assumptions are wrong 
weve given up our old myths so now we have an archaeologist 
telling us about the bible a few years ago it would have been a 
preacher fronting a documentary on the bible and 200 years ago you 
would have been killed if you said the wrong thing 
although he looks for a historical foundation frequently 
examining biblical sites for evidence romer is also quite 
sympathetic to acceptance on faith alone 
now instead of adam and eve we have social darwinism he 
said on the whole id rather have adam and eve it deals with a 
story and is constructed around issues 
the first onehour episode once upon a time airs wednesday 
friday and sunday and is about the origins of the bible the 
second chronicles and kings airing jan 8 examines the 
accuracy of the old testament as history the third mightier than 
the sword is about the hebrew bible and the influence of greece 
upon the writing of the old testament the fourth show gospel 
truth airing jan 22 looks into the historical existence of 
jesus 
there is no written evidence from his own lifetime that jesus 
ever existed romer said i think the most powerful indication 
of jesus is the church itself within a short period of time after 
his death the church was established thats indication of an 
incredible energy 
the fifth episode thine is the kingdom airing jan 29 is 
about how the roman empire was converted to christianity the sixth 
power amp glory airing feb 5 looks into how christianity and 
the bible survived the dark ages and the final show paradise 
lost airing feb 12 examines what has happened to the bible in 
the last few hundred years 
the program is not only about the bible but what is 
historically true said romer its virtually impossible to 
prove something didnt happen you cant prove that adam and eve 
didnt exist history is a series of experiences everyone sees 
something different 
the way this great book has been treated by kings and princes 
is a gruesome tale but what it does give us is absolutely 
astonishing the book of genesis contains some of the oldest stories 
in the world but in the last hundred or so years the bible has 
become a civic and scientific guide to the universe and mans 
society the way a lot of vicars use the bible they could just as 
well use the brothers grimm 
romer has written books on ancient egypt and the bible and has 
written other documentary series on egypt he directed the 
excavation of the tomb of pharaoh ramses xi in 197779 and in 1979 
cofounded the theban foundation of berkeley calif an 
organization dedicated to conservation of the royal tombs of thebes 
he has also worked on numerous archaeological expeditions for the 
university of chicago 
romer lives in italy but also has a home in the valley of the 
kings in egypt 
ive spent most of my adult life in two very religious 
countries he said its made a great impression on me 
especially the muslims but the christian peasants have also 
educated me i think its very important that if youre studying an 
ancient world that you live in a place like that i dont know how 
young students studying ancient greece can understand it living in a 
modern country 
romer said he first got into making television films as a means 
of fundraising he said he was astonished how little people care 
about the past television became a way of showing contributors 
where the money was going and to explain complicated things 
television is the greatest selling medium ever devised he 
said i dont think you can educate people in the classic sense 
but you can get them interested in investigating more i want people 
to have a care for old things i want them to treat the past in a 
more respectful way

in the summer of 1964 1000 young volunteers 
from mainstream america arrived in mississippi to help register 
black voters they were idealistic and committed believing their 
enthusiasm and good intentions could make a difference 
but it was a time when martin luther king jrs dream had not 
yet stemmed the hate and violence of segregation during that season 
of the mississippi summer project there were 1000 arrests 30 
bombings 35 churches burned 80 people beaten and at least six 
murders 
three of those murders are the focus of alan parkers new movie 
mississippi burning a fictionalized account of the slaying of 
james chaney andrew goodman and michael schwerner 
the story of that racially explosive summer when goodman a 
student at queens college and schwerner and chaney members of core 
congress of racial equality disappeared and were killed is told 
through the eyes of two fbi agents portrayed by gene hackman and 
willem dafoe 
this was the intention of screenwriter chris gerolmo who thought 
the case was a good story that would be interesting to tell from 
the perspective of the investigators 
i never understood this to be hollywoods civil rights 
picture he said its an exciting story about something 
important 
you see our moral failures and greatness it allows us to see 
america at its very worst and also to see people who displayed great 
moral courage thats a real story 
however what emerges on the screen is more a detective story 
than a portrait of a great struggle and that has some critics and 
civil rights workers miffed the heroes are not those who at times 
sacrificed their lives or wellbeing to ensure black civil rights 
but the fbi 
it was unfortunate that it was so narrow in scope that it did 
not show one black role model that todays youth who look at the 
movie could remember said myrlie evers commissioner of public 
works in los angeles whose husband medgar a field secretary for 
the naacp was shot to death by white segregationists outside their 
home in 1963 
in the state of mississippi not one leader was mentioned not 
rev george lee who gave his life so that people could register 
and vote no activist fannie lou hamer certainly no medgar 
evers who was the pioneer the motivator of the civil rights 
movement in mississippi 
she also took issue with parkers portrayal of the agents as 
compassionate dafoe marches with mourners at chaneys funeral 
i dont remember the fbi agents we came in contact with as 
being concerned with the health and welfare of the blacks evers 
said we were more or less harassed by them 
and she challenged the filmmakers treatment of blacks the 
fear that you saw in the expression of the actors who played the 
roles of blacks was certainly accurate during that time but to 
simply show fear and no courage is very very sad 
mary king a white southerner who worked in the summer project 
and knew the slain volunteers talks about the fbi in her book 
freedom song published last year by william morrow and co 
practically everyone working in the civil rights movement knew 
from firsthand experience of the duplicity of the fbi in many 
instances fbi agents could be seen watching a demonstration while 
fraternizing with sheriffs and local law officers it has now 
become commonly accepted that some of these agents were themselves 
members of the ku klux klan 
despite her misgivings evers said mississippi burning the 
name of the fbi file on the case was nevertheless a powerful film 
the beatings the lynchings the burnings i remember them 
she said there was a flood of remembering i could almost reach 
out and touch the screen and feel the pain but my pain was 
doublefold not only what i saw on the screen but also the 
neglect in telling the entire story 
the film could be a contender in the upcoming academy award race 
and has already won awards from the national board of review of 
motion pictures for best director best actor hackman and best 
supporting actress frances mcdormand 
it takes place in 1964 the year president lyndon johnson signed 
the civil rights act and when king won the nobel prize for peace 
it also was one of the most racially violent years of the decade 
with riots beatings bombings and murders 
the date is june 21 chaney goodman and schwerner are stopped by 
a group of white police and civilians while driving to philadelphia 
miss to investigate the burning of a black church and some 
beatings the whites are openly hostile one sticks a gun in the 
drivers ear and pulls the trigger 
the trio had gone to mississippi where only 5 percent of the 
black population which made up 45 percent of the state was 
registered to vote 
a few days after they failed to check in with the project as 
they were required to do when in the field schwerners charred 
station wagon was discovered in bogue chitto creek 15 miles north 
of philadelphia their bodies were found in a crude grave on a 
nearby farm on aug 4 the three had been shot and chaneys skull 
had been fractured from a severe beating in december 21 whites 
were arrested murder charges were dropped in state court but six 
were later convicted in federal court for violating civil rights 
laws 
gerolmo interpreted some of the story himself for instance the 
identity of the person who tipped off the fbi about where the bodies 
were buried remains unknown in the movie though the informant 
turns out to be the deputy sheriffs wife mcdormand gerolmo 
considered it a logical plot twist 
the wives were often a source of information he said 
gerolmo is the son of frank gero a theater manager and producer 
his brother sculptor mark gero is married to the actress liza 
minnelli he was born in chicago and attended harvard university 
where he taught filmmaking before going into offbroadway theatrical 
production his first movie miles from home was a boxoffice 
bomb 
a new york grade schooler when chaney goodman and schwerner were 
killed the incident greatly affected his way of thinking 
it was the first time i ever considered that our country could 
be wrong he said my mother was active in the civil right 
movement she marched from selma to montgomery and we used to 
discuss it around the house 
with mississippi burning he hoped to depict american life in 
general filmmakers john ford and frank capra were his inspirations 
capra ford they took on the task to say what america is 
gerolmo said it has something to do with taking responsibility

the oncehallowed wall street tradition of 
investing in growth stocks has fallen on very hard times of late 
the crash of 1987 had something to do with that but as 
statistical measures show the big market break only accelerated a 
trend that has been in motion for at least five and maybe as much 
as 15 years 
all this is documented by the investment firm kidder peabody amp 
co which publishes a monthly compilation of what it calls the 
top 50 the 50 issues traded on the new york stock exchange 
that carry the highest priceearnings ratios 
as you might expect this list is typically dominated by 
companies with strong growth records for example cocacola walt 
disney and merck and eli lilly in pharmaceuticals as well as 
smaller entities like jm smucker and tootsie roll industries 
logically stocks of companies that demonstrate the ability to 
produce aboveaverage growth should sell at higher pes than those 
with more modest prospects and they do 
but the difference between the median pe of kidders top 50 and 
that of the market as a whole represented by standard amp poors 
500stock composite index has lately contracted to the smallest 
premium it has ever shown in calculations dating back to 1960 
in the 1960s and early 1970s the top 50s pe sometimes was more 
than three times that of the general market as recently as 1983 
the premium stood at 25 times 
in november it fell to 13 times the market multiple in effect 
extra growth is being offered in the marketplace at almost no extra 
charge 
what brought about this devaluation it started in the 70s with 
the collapse of a style of investing that focused on what were 
called onedecision stocks 
under this philosophy money managers at investing institutions 
bought stocks of glamour growth companies with the presumed 
intention of owning them forever it didnt matter very much how 
dearly you paid for these stocks since you were never going to sell 
them 
then the recession and bear market of 197374 knocked down that 
notion with a resounding thud 
more recently says kidder peabody analyst evelyn feit several 
forces have combined to compress the top 50s premium among them 
the takeover and buyout binge 
investors attention has been focused on immediate rewards 
reaped through buyouts restructurings and such rather than on the 
longterm investment potential of growth stocks she observes 
this has been accompanied by a diminution of confidence in 
growth projects 
tax reform also did growth stocks no favor by eliminating the 
special tax break for longterm capital gains capital gains are the 
prime allure of these stocks since fastgrowing companies usually 
pay modest or no dividends 
now that all investment income is taxed at the same rates the 
fashion has shifted markedly to a total return approach 
that left growth stocks more vulnerable than before to 
competition from lowrisk interestbearing investments especially 
when the rates those investments pay get as high as they have been 
lately 
since the change in the tax rules was a onetime event ms feit 
suggests the blow it dealt to growth stocks was probably a 
onetime adjustment 
the way she sees it all this may represent an opportunity for 
bargainconscious investors who believe growth wont stay out of 
vogue forever in the investment world 
the growth sector appears positioned to show improved relative 
performance she contends perhaps as early as 1989 if past 
patterns are repeated

in the manner of casablanca the nbc 
miniseries twist of fate was filmed with different endings 
the story was very cleverly orchestrated so that it could be 
cut three different ways said veronica hamel formerly of hill 
street blues who stars in the international thriller 
im happy with the choice they made because it was my choice 
its good that people can creatively agree and pull their resources 
together i felt very good working on this which is not always the 
case 
hamel stars with ben cross bruce greenwood john glover and 
sarah jessica parker in this story told against the background of 
world war ii the holocaust and the founding of israel the 
fourhour miniseries which airs sunday and monday is based on the 
novel pursuit by robert l fish 
its a good yarn with a lot of twists said hamel its not 
just about the holocaust its about people and relationships 
the show as the title indicates is indeed filled with twists 
briefly german ss officer helmet von schraeder greenwood 
fleeing allied prosecution has his identity changed through plastic 
surgery and poses as ben grossman a jew now played by cross 
interned in a concentration camp he is befriended by and gains 
respect for his fellow prisoners eventually he becomes a founding 
father of israel 
greenwood returns later in the miniseries in a dual role as bens 
grown son who discovers the awful truth about his father and tries 
to bring him to justice meanwhile former nazi colleagues learn the 
fathers secret and attempt to blackmail him into helping with their 
terrorist scheme 
hamel plays deborah the jewish woman ben marries 
as soon as i read the script i liked the feel and texture 
said hamel i wanted to climb into her skin i liked her passion 
she wasnt an appendage to a man she had her own very strong views 
he meets deborah when he leaves the prison camp and goes to 
palestine said hamel she is completely unaware of his past 
she has a philosophy that is a strong as her love in fact her 
philosophy comes first she becomes a doctor but shes not as 
political as golda meir but at the end when im old i look like a 
cross between golda meir and indira gandhi 
i have a lot of padding to make me look thicker that helps 
having all those layers i have to buy it first then the audience 
will buy it the first time i saw myself on the screen i started to 
giggle 
the miniseries was filmed on location in yugoslavia where hamel 
got a lot of action playing a member of the israeli army this is 
probably the closest ill ever get to playing harrison ford she 
said working in yugoslavia she said was like being catapulted 
out of your life 
the twopart miniseries originally was scheduled for december 
but nbc decided to hold it until after the holidays 
hamel a native of philadelphia was a leading model before she 
turned to acting she made her stage debut in an offoffbroadway 
show the big knife after several years in dinnertheater 
productions she moved to los angeles in 1975 and landed guest shots 
on such shows as the rockford files dallas and family 
at one point she was cast in charlies angels at the time 
called harrys angels she withdrew from the series before it 
went into production and the role went to jaclyn smith 
hamel who only recently returned from yugoslavia is now busy 
with her own projects 
im looking for a writer for a project i will coproduce and 
star in she said its a twohour film for tv and its not a 
pilot i dont want to do a series ive done that it would be hard 
to find another as good as hill street blues you have to sign for 
seven years and thats a long commitment its like a marriage 
hill street was a class act 
i want to do some movies but it takes years to get things off 
the ground i have an idea for a feature im looking for a 
development deal i spend a lot of time reading scripts and books 
its hard to just sit down and read for enjoyment 
hamel devotes part of her time to stuart house a center for 
sexually abused children she is on the board of directors she also 
has worked for six years with a rape treatment center

history by paying a record 650 million in fines and restitution and 
pleading guilty to six felonies reversing its longstanding claims 
of innocence 
the battle had already cost the firm nearly 2 billion in 
attorneys fees and lost business 
drexel also agreed to cooperate with giulianis expanding probes 
into financial trading abuses spawned largely by the downfall of 
ivan f boesky the convicted speculator who fingered drexel and 
others more than two years ago 
the decision came moments before a deadline set by giuliani to 
drexel following weeks of bluffs counterbluffs and leaks to the 
newspapers that a climax was imminent 
postmortem accounts of this historic showdown reveal giuliani 
told drexels directors he was going to make an announcement at 4 
pm wednesday 
he said its going to be either an indictment or a 
settlement you decide said one source familiar with the final 
predeadline maneuvering who requested anonymity it was a game 
of blink and drexel blinked 
the biggest weapon in giulianis arsenal was his threat to 
subject drexel to the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations 
act commonly known as rico a widely feared farreaching statute 
originally designed to combat drug runners gangsters and pimps 
if drexel had been indicted under that act the government could 
have frozen much of its assets and seized what prosecutors had 
reason to believe were the firms illgotten gains before trial to 
hold as security 
individuals named in the indictment would have been forced to 
surrender their earnings during the period of alleged wrongdoing a 
trial could have taken months or even years diverting time energy 
and money from a firm that has prided itself on efficiency 
aggressiveness and big profits 
moreover convictions would have exposed drexel to multiple civil 
lawsuits that could have resulted in many hundreds of millions of 
dollars in fines because of the racketeering acts provision for 
triple damages to victims 
a racketeering indictment would have come at the worst possible 
time for drexel which has been playing crucial financing roles in 
nearly every multibilliondollar takeover of the year most notably 
a 5 billion bridge loan for kohlberg kravis roberts amp cos 245 
billion acquisition of rjr nabisco inc 
drexel executives were known to be anxious to protect their 
interest in that deal which could net as much as 300 million in 
fees 
only a few weeks before giulianis drexel deadline the 
prosecutor had demonstrated vividly to the firm just how powerful 
the racketeering act can be 
the small new jersey investment partnership princeton newport 
partners liquidated because five of its principals and a former 
drexel trader had been indicted under the statute in august by a 
giulianidirected grand jury 
the majority of drexels directors decided not to risk a similar 
fate and opted instead for a settlement that would label the firm a 
felon but at least put the investigation behind it for good 
in other economic and business news this past week 
british conglomerate grand metropolitan plc acquired pillsbury 
co for 568 billion ending the minneapolisbased food and 
restaurant concerns feeble effort to thwart the takeover largely 
by relying on its poisonpill shareholder rights defense grand 
mets triumph raised new questions about the effectiveness of poison 
pills which have been repeatedly challenged in court 
government figures presented more mixed evidence of the 
economys health inflation eased slightly in november while 
consumer spending and orders for large durable goods rose for the 
third quarter of the year the broadest measure of economic growth 
was 25 percent down slightly from an earlier estimate of 26 
percent none of the figures pointed decisively to a slowdown or an 
overheated economy but there was speculation that the federal 
reserve would move soon to hike interest rates if it viewed 
inflation as a threat 
the big three automakers said vehicle sales jumped 153 percent 
during the middecember period paced by a 359 percent leap in ford 
motor co car sales the performance reflected a major improvement 
over the same time a year earlier when consumers spooked by the 
october 1987 stock market crash cut back on spending for expensive 
items

wall streeters will have to wait until after 
christmas to learn whether the federal reserve has a present for 
the markets in the form of an increase in its discount rate 
for several weeks now there has been widespread speculation in 
the financial world that the central bank would raise the rate 
which it sets on loans to private financial institutions 
but the discount rate has remained where it stood since last aug 
9 when the fed increased it from 6 percent to 65 percent 
during this period analysts say the fed has indeed been taking 
steps to tighten its credit policy in an effort to stave off a 
revival of inflation 
the central bank has chosen however to pursue that policy by 
more subtle means than a discount rate change specifically by 
maneuvers creating upward pressure on the federal funds rate 
federal funds are overnight loans between banks 
the result has been a rise in all shortterm interest rates that 
are determined by the money markets 
so when and if the discount rate is changed it could well be 
interpreted on wall street as nothing more than a catchup move 
the cutting edge of monetary policy is the federal funds 
rate said darwin beck an economist at first boston corp in a 
bulletin to the firms clients the fed will raise the discount 
rate when it suits its purposes 
when the fed raises the discount rate is less important than 
what it signifies 
will it reflect the end of a firming phase or the beginning of 
a further tightening for the answer we will have to wait for the 
announcement and the justification the fed gives for the hike 
the hope on wall street is that the fed will be able at some 
point in the new year to change gears and start loosening credit 
conditions 
for that to happen analysts reason chairman alan greenspan and 
his fellow policymakers would want to see convincing evidence that 
economic growth was slowing 
and the fed might also hold out for an agreement between 
presidentelect bush and congress on substantial measures to reduce 
the federal budget deficit 
the tricky part of slowing the economy and shrinking the budget 
deficit is to do so without causing a recession 
amid hopes that that mission could be accomplished the stock 
market continued its tentative lowvolume yearend rally in the past 
week 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials rose 1822 points to 
216893 
the new york stock exchange composite index gained 90 to 15606 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market added 
154 to 37734 and the american stock exchange market value index 
was up 485 at 30222 
volume on the big board averaged 14057 million shares a day 
against 14443 million the week before 
if fears of an approaching recession intensify in the months 
ahead argues david resler economist at nomura securities 
international they could actually help prevent one from occurring 
that could happen he said if worries about the future 
took some of the exuberance out of current spending so that growth 
could slow enough to let the fed reverse some of this years 
credittightening 
some might judge that scenario as too much to hope for but the 
lessons of 1988 seem to suggest it is not 
the economy has shown itself to be both more resilient and less 
prone to inflation than most economists believed possible

it was the year they held a presidential election and half the 
nations voters decided to stay home 
it was the year rescuers decided to free a trio of battered 
barnacleencrusted gray whales trapped in the ice at the top of the 
world it was the year an early decision to let yellowstone burn 
altered the face of the showcase national park for a century to come 
it was the year oprah decided to diet soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev decided he wanted to be president attorney general edwin 
meese iii decided to resign evangelist jimmy swaggart decided to 
confess his sins and michael spinks decided to challenge world 
heavyweight champion mike tyson 
some decisions worked others didnt 
soviets and americans pulled together to free two surviving 
whales last seen cruising toward warmer waters soviet president 
andrei gromyko bowed out and gorbachev took over oprah winfrey 
the tv host lost 67 pounds 
in yellowstone however officials realized too late they might 
have made the wrong decision by the time firefighters arrived 
unusually dry weather and high winds had fires ripping out of 
control forcing evacuation of towns and causing an uproar among 
area residents 
swaggart preached on but lost much of his audience after the 
assemblies of god decided to defrock him spinks lasted for just 91 
seconds and eight decisive blows 
the wisdom of other decisions remained to be seen 
faced with the choice between vice president george bush and 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis and frustrated by one of the 
most lowdown dirty presidential campaigns ever an ambivalent 
electorate waffled and fidgeted and finally succumbed to 
overwhelming inertia 
ive always loved election years president reagan said but 
it seemed hardly anyone else did bushs 5446 percent victory over 
his democratic opponent was based on a 50 percent voter turnout the 
lowest in 64 years 
political analysts looked at exit polls and determined that many 
voters werent voting for anyone so much as they were voting against 
the other guy they also determined that bush lost 2 percent of his 
supporters because they were turned off by his first major decision 
to tap as his running mate indiana sen dan quayle the first 
baby boomer on a national ticket and a choice that surprised 
even bushs advisers 
it was democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen the 
silverhaired smoothtalking senator from texas who provided the 
only memorable line from the three nationally televised debates 
senator you are no jack kennedy bentsen told a flustered 
quayle after the 41yearold senator had compared himself with the 
late democratic president 
the kennedy image haunted the campaign and the nation the 25th 
anniversary of his assassination became a time to reflect on 
idealism lost and a world changed 
nowhere was that change more apparent than in ussoviet 
relations 
kennedy on the campaign trail himself 28 years ago shunned 
nikita khrushchev when he visited new york but gorbachev the first 
soviet leader since khrushchev to taste the big apple had a 
superpower lunch with reagan and bush on dec 7 and addressed the 
united nations with no khrushchevstyle shoethumping instead he 
promised to trim 500000 men and 10000 tanks from the soviet armed 
forces 
the visit ended abruptly when a devastating earthquake hit soviet 
armenia the soviet leader rushed home to learn that an estimated 
60000 had died and 500000 were left homeless as whole cities 
crumbled under the quakes force 
rescue teams doctors and planes loaded with supplies poured in 
from around the world it was the first time since world war ii that 
the soviet union had accepted disaster relief from the united states 
reagan paid his first visit to moscow in june for a summit that 
failed to break new ground in arms control the president hammered 
away on human rights issues and gorbachev later sent america living 
proof of his commitment to change 
nobel laureate andrei sakharov father of the soviet dissident 
movement was allowed his first trip outside the soviet union after 
years of agitation over soviet human rights policies 
americans vigorously agitated for their own causes more than 
5000 people were arrested in antiabortion protests that began in 
july in 32 cities and continued through the year roe vs wade the 
supreme court decision legalizing abortion turned 15 years old 
intact 
anthony mcleod kennedy confirmed as a supreme court justice by a 
unanimous senate inherited a pivotal vote on the abortion issue but 
gave no hint of his views 
court dockets bulged with the celebrated cases of the 
oncepowerful 
former philippine president ferdinand e marcos and his wife 
imelda were indicted on racketeering charges alleging they 
plundered their homeland of millions and defrauded us banks harry 
and leona helmsley the king and queen of new york real estate 
pleaded innocent to dozens of tax evasion charges 
republican evan mecham of arizona became the first governor in a 
halfcentury to be impeached and removed from office although he 
was acquitted on criminal charges of concealing a 350000 campaign 
loan 
oliver north john poindexter richard secord and albert hakim 
pleaded innocent to charges of defrauding the government by selling 
arms to iran and giving the proceeds to the contras at a time when 
us aid to the nicaraguan rebels was banned 
congress refused to restore military aid to the contras but 
decided to approve humanitarian aid after the nicaraguan rebels and 
the sandinista government reached a temporary truce 
in a decision that stunned israel president reagan authorized 
talks with yasser arafats palestine liberation organization for the 
first time in at least 13 years our object is not a dialogue 
secretary of state george p shultz said our object is peace 
uneasy peace prevailed in the 8yearold iraniraq war after a 
united nationssponsored ceasefire began aug 20 peace talks 
opened five days later they were deadlocked within 24 hours in

the economy is headed into 1989 with healthy growth in orders for 
big ticket durable goods according to a government report 
the commerce department said thursday that durable goods orders 
climbed 18 percent in november not counting the erratic defense 
category 
the report had little effect on the financial markets 
including defense orders total durable goods orders edged up 
only 01 percent in november to a seasonally adjusted 12289 
billion that followed a giant 29 percent rise in october 
the overall figure was inflated by a big jump in military orders 
in october and then depressed when military orders returned to more 
normal levels last month 
discounting the swings in defense orders in the civilian 
category climbed 18 percent in november the best showing since a 
52 percent august increase civilin orders had risen only 02 
percent in october 
analysts said they were impressed by the strength in civilian 
orders and said the orders should keep us plants operating busily 
through the first half of 1989 
this was an impressive gain and it should pretty much insure 
that the economy will keep growing next year said michael evans 
head of a washington forecasting firm

a historic plea bargain that would spare drexel 
burnham lambert inc from a criminal indictment has incited a mixed 
reaction among its staff and skepticism by a key washington 
lawmaker who suggested the 650 million penalty slapped on the wall 
street giant might not go far enough 
rep john dingell the michigan democrat who chairs a committee 
with oversight authority in the securities industry said thursday 
he would have to see details of the settlement before drawing 
conclusions 
main street has less reason to trust wall street he said 
when the details of the settlement come out well find out 
whether main street has reason to trust their government 
he also said i have no reason to believe that main street will 
be satisifed by anything less than the most serious punishment 
currently the public regards markets as a crap shoot and has been 
avoiding them like the devil avoids holy water 
the agreement announced wednesday would require drexel to plead 
guilty to six felonies and pay a record 650 million in fines and 
restitution to settle asyet unspecified charges most likely 
stemming from its relationship with ivan boesky the nowimprisoned 
inside trader who fingered the firm 
in addition it would require drexel to provide investigators 
with evidence of possible wrongdoing by its highyield bond 
financier michael milken and others 
although drexel senior executives expressed relief about the 
settlement and predicted the firm would thrive sources familiar 
with internal criticism of the decision said other employees felt 
embittered and concerned 
theres not going to be a mass exodus but i think in time 
significant people will leave said one of the sources who spoke 
on condition they not be identified i think suicide is a little 
strong but i think its like cutting off your arms and legs 
the plea bargain marked a stunning turnaround for drexel which 
had asserted its innocence since being implicated by boesky more 
than two years ago and had denounced him as a convicted felon and 
doublecrosser 
others said milken a key target of the criminal investigation 
spawned by boesky felt betrayed by the drexel decision which 
weakens his own defense 
milken has maintained his innocence and has reiterated that he 
would fight any indictment but the sources said that if he were 
indicted he would terminate his relationship with drexel which 
milken helped grow into one of the most aggressive and profitable 
firms 
at the same time the agreement took tremendous pressure off 
chief executive frederick joseph and other senior managers who had 
been urging colleagues to swallow their pride and settle the case so 
the firm could leave the protracted ordeal behind 
the agreement also raised the prospect that former white house 
chief of staff howard baker whose tennessee law practice has been 
advising drexel for months would become chairman as part of a 
longterm recovery strategy sources familiar with bakerdrexel 
discussions said 
baker the onetime tennessee senator who has been conferring in 
new york with drexel aides almost every other week was visiting the 
firm a day before the settlement was reached the sources said 
clearly the decision yesterday wednesday removes one of the 
major obstacles said one source now you can see the 
opportunity to talk in more detail about such a role 
bakers spokesman thomas griscom declined to comment on bakers 
discussions or speculation about his selection as chairman 
they have continued to talk and we expect that to go forward 
for the next several weeks griscom said drexel spokesman steven 
anreder said we echo comments about discussions with him but 
theres nothing wider on the table 
the settlement agreement still requires approval from senior 
justice department officials and the securities and exchange 
commission which sued drexel milken and others three months ago on 
civil charges of conspiring with boesky to profit on inside 
information manipulate stock and commit other frauds 
sources familiar with the agreement said these other agencies 
must approve the agreement by midjanuary 
chiles larson a spokesman for the sec in washington declined to 
comment on the agreement or on the status of possible discussions 
with drexel anreder drexels spokesman also declined to comment 
on any sec discussions

after settling the nations biggest securities 
fraud case drexel burnham lambert inc now faces the crucial task 
of retaining its clients who include many wellknown takeover 
strategists 
the beleaguered wall street firm received some staunch support 
from a number of corporate clients thursday one day after it 
agreeing to plead guilty to six fraud charges and pay the government 
a record 650 million penalty 
but some clients said privately they still needed to review 
whether the pleabargaining arrangement would change their close 
business relationship with drexel 
i dont think anything at this point is that clear said a 
spokesman for one client which did not want to be identified 
in announcing its plea agreement late wednesday drexel avoided 
what could have been a lengthy costly trial that threatened to 
slowly destroy the firm the government had spent two years 
investigating drexels relationship with ivan f boesky the former 
stock speculator was accused of insider trading 
although the 650 million settlement is the largest ever in a 
securities fraud case drexel said it may have cost more in lost 
business and legal fees had it continued to fight the federal 
charges frederick h joseph drexel chief executive officer said 
the company already has lost about 15 billion in business and paid 
out 175 million in legal expenses 
the settlement though does not protect michael milken drexels 
highyield junk bond whiz and another key target of the criminal 
probe milken repeatedly has asserted his innocence 
drexel now faces the formidable task of retaining its key 
clientele even without milken if it hopes to remain one of the 
most powerful and profitable investment banks on wall street 
milken has generated billions of dollars in revenue for drexel 
through junk bond underwriting much of which has been used to 
finance some of the biggest corporate takeovers of the decade 
loyal clients have included such takeover strategists as carl 
icahn ronald o perelman saul steinberg and william farley 
its obviously a serious blow to drexel said farley 
chairman and chief executive of chicagobased farley industries 
which contemplates using drexelfloated junk bonds to buy 
westpointpepperell inc 
farley said drexel has assured him it will be able to fulfill its 
role in the financing he said he was confident the firm could 
finance the acquisition of westpointpepperell under any scenario 
you could describe and that obviously includes without drexel 
a drexel spokesman said thursday that the firm would continue 
reassuring its clients that the government settlement would not 
interfere with any of its current or future deals 
we have a program of communication with employees and 
clients which we consider to be our principal constituentcies 
said steven s anreder a senior vice president for the new york 
firm the people ive spoken to have indicated their support 
among the staunch supporters have been such small 
growthoriented companies as red bank nj real estate developer 
hovnanian enterprises inc 
we feel indebted to drexel said hovnanian president ara 
hovnanian they helped us a great deal with our financing and 
thats why well be standing with them in their difficult times 
hovnanian said drexels 100 million in junk bonds enabled it 
grow more than sixfold over the past six year 
thomas reed spokesman for shamrock holdings inc which hopes to 
take over polaroid corp with the help of drexel junkbond 
financing said his firm would maintain its relationship with drexel 
shamrock is gratified that drexels put the whole thing behind 
them its been a very difficult experience but it resolves any 
uncertainties real or imagined that may have existed on wall 
street concerning drexels ability to operate reed said 
harold simmons billionaire chairman of dallasbased valhi inc 
was equally as supportive 
simmons said he used drexel to float junk bonds three times most 
recently in february when he increased his stake in nl industries a 
company of which he is now chairman 
im sure well be doing business with them in the future he 
said

a 20 million settlement with the final defendant 
essentially ends the washington public power supply system 
securitiesfraud trial but the nearly sixyearold case is far from 
over 
the federal judge hearing the case still must decide whether to 
approve the outofcourt settlements reached by defendants in the 
class action suit and then how to divide the roughly 750 million 
among 24000plus plaintiffs and attorneys 
plaintiff attorney mel weiss said late thursday in a telephone 
interview from florida that the settlement pool may not be dispensed 
until late next year or even later if disputes arise 
the settlement by the final defendant blyth eastman painewebber 
inc a financial adviser to wppss was announced thursday 
us district judge william browning still must approve 16 
separate settlements reached over much of the past year browning 
already has approved four settlements reached as early as september 
1987 
the legal action grew from wppss 1983 default on 225 billion 
in bonds sold to finance two nuclear power plants that were 
abandoned before completion the default was the biggest in the 
history of the municipal bond market 
browning was hearing the securities fraud case in tucson ariz 
on a change of venue from washington state 
the more than 100 original defendants have agreed to pay about 
700 million to settle the case and another 50 million could be 
collected from contested insurance claims 
plaintiff bondholders had made total claims of 16 billion 
the trial which started sept 7 had been expected to take up to 
a year browning now is expected to dismiss the jurors who recessed 
dec 1 
in addition to approving the settlements browning must decide 
how to divide the money among several classes of plaintiffs and 
among dozens of attorneys 
attorneys said they hoped to get the notice of settlements to the 
class of plaintiffs by jan 16 and to get approval for all of them 
in a march hearing 
distribution of the money will be determined after browning holds 
fairness hearings presumably in seattle if all the money is in 
hand and there are no challenges the award can be sent to 
plaintiffs all at once said weiss 
we hope that can be done by the end of 1989 he said 
some money still could be distributed if there is a dispute with 
the court withholding disputed funds 
defendants in the federal lawsuit which incorporated dozens of 
separate suits dating to feb 22 1983 included the supply system 
the 88 utilities that contracted with wppss to build the two plants 
engineering firms wall street bond underwriters utility and wppss 
directors and blyth eastman 
the default was on bonds wppss sold to finance construction 
starting in the late 1970s on its plants no 4 at the hanford 
nuclear reservation and no 5 at satsop west of olympia 
wppss abandoned the plants in 1982 because of rising construction 
costs and doubts about the need for the plants power default 
occurred in july 1983 after the washington state supreme court ruled 
that utilities participating in construction of the plants lacked 
authority to sign contracts with wppss guaranteeing payment even if 
no electricity was generated 
there there has been little complaint about most of the 
settlements but a proposal by the state of washington to pay 10 
million to settle any claims that might be brought against it has 
been criticized by plaintiffs in a state court lawsuit 
those plaintiffs claim the washington state auditor failed to 
audit the supply system and to examine bond resolutions prior to 
bond sales thus failing to protect investors plaintiffs are 
seeking the return of their full 225 billion investment plus 
interest they would have received over the 30year life of the 
bonds a claim that could total 7 billion

drexel burnham lambert incs historic 
pleabargain deal with federal prosecutors has had little effect on 
the financial markets 
news of the settlement of fraud charges caused nary a ripple 
thursday even in drexels own backyard the market for highrisk 
highyield junk bonds which the investment firm pioneered 
conventional bonds as well as stocks also failed to register a 
reaction 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials slipped 428 points to 
216036 thursday 
a flight to quality out of junk bonds and into conventional 
securities which had been predicted in some quarters as a result of 
the drexel debacle failed to materialize 
treasury corporate and municipal bonds had an uneventful trading 
day finishing mixed the yield on the treasurys closely watched 
30year bond slipped to 893 percent from 894 percent late 
wednesday 
us attorney rudolph w giuliani announced late wednesday after 
the markets closed that drexel had reversed itself by agreeing to 
admit guilt to six felonies and pay a record 650 million fine to 
settle the biggest securities fraud case in history 
expectations of a drexel settlement had grown in recent days and 
the markets werent taken by surprise in fact they seemed relieved 
that the business was over with and drexel had decided not to wage a 
risky fight 
this ones been hanging around for some time said monte 
gordon director of research at dreyfus corp 
all the markets were quiet at any rate as trading slowed in 
anticipation of the christmas and new years holidays 
the only surprise is that the drexel settlement happened on 
wednesday said micheal metz a stock market analyst for 
oppenheimer amp co at least for the moment drexel is still in the 
arena and functioning 
wall street had already shown some support wednesday for an 
anticipated settlement by lifting share prices of rjr nabisco inc 
polaroid corp and a few other takeoverrelated companies junk 
bonds are widely used to finance debtfinanced takeovers of 
companies 
the takeover stocks have been buoying the otherwise lackluster 
market in recent weeks 
without the boost provided by those stocks weve got no 
performance at all period said oppenheimers metz

nearly a continent away from wall 
street but dead center in its latest insidertrading scandal junk 
bond king michael milken works on an opulent avenue lined with tony 
boutiques and stately hotels 
the decision of his employer drexel burnham lambert inc to pay 
a record 650 million fine to settle criminal securities fraud 
charges has reportedly split the companys ranks over the fate of 
milken but there was little outward sign of that turmoil thursday 
employees arriving for work the few who would acknowledge a 
reporter refused to talk about the case attempts to get into 
drexels unobtrusive offices were rebuffed by uniformed guards who 
staff the reception desk of the building on rodeo drive the 
shoppers mecca 
milken has said through spokesmen that he is prepared to fight 
criminal charges believed pending against him according to some who 
saw him socially during the many months the drexel investigation has 
been publicly unwinding milken appears to have retained his 
customary enthusiasm for business and extensive charitable interests 
hes not a defensivetype guy said richard riordan a los 
angeles attorney and investor and friend of milkens who last saw 
him 10 days ago at a charity event 
he acts like nothing has happened and his whole time and effort 
is spent on the thing at hand riordan said my guess is hes a 
tough guy i think hes going to keep doing business as usual 
the very fact of drexels presence in this enclave of the rich 
and famous is testament to milkens importance to drexel and his 
willingness to flout convention not only is beverly hills out of 
manhattan its a good 10 miles from the los angeles financial 
district 
drexels offices are spread through two lowrise gray marble 
buildings that also house the aristocratic gumps department store 
a clothing boutique and a savings and loan office 
across rodeo drive is the ornate beverly wilshire hotel where 
nancy reagan stays when shes in town up the way are shops of 
cartier tiffany amp co and van cleef amp arpels jewelers where 
president reagan bought the first couples wedding ring 
inside the office milken and his lieutenants line up buyers and 
sellers of highrisk highyield junk bonds much of drexels junk 
bond business depends on this network with previous issuers of 
bonds often being tapped to buy someone elses new issue 
milken is said to have tired of working in new york and to have 
persuaded drexel that the business could be done by telephone from 
anywhere

the central bank lowered belgiums most 
important interest rate friday following last weeks rate increases 
the banque nationale de belgique cut the rate on threemonth 
treasury certificates to 75 percent from 765 percent it also cut 
the rate for one and twomonth certificates to 74 percent from 75 
percent 
last weeks rate increases had been part of a concerted round 
decided by a number of european central banks 
a central bank official said the stability of the foreign 
exchange markets and the strength of the belgian economy and trade 
balances had allowed the bank to lower the threemonth rate 
it is the policy of the bank to keep rates as low as possible 
and the international environment allowed this said the official 
who asked not to be named 
belgium raised its rates through much of last summer and lowered 
them in a series of small steps this past fall in line with 
international trends 
last week the downtrend came to an abrupt halt when the central 
bank saw itself forced to act in concert with other central banks to 
nip budding inflation with rate increases

eastern airlines and the machinists union plan to 
return to the bargaining table on jan 6 for intense federal 
mediation aimed at ending a yearold contract snafu which management 
claims is helping destroy the carrier 
federal mediator harry bickford said thursday that the 
negotiations were aimed at settling the dispute without declaring an 
impasse that would trigger a 30day coolingoff period 
national mediation board chairman walter wallace will participate 
in the talks which are expected to last at least a week at an 
undisclosed location 
negotiations have bogged down over the machinists refusal to 
accept any major pay cuts machinists leader charles e bryan has 
charged that eastern management wants to provoke a strike as a 
unionbusting tactic 
eastern spokesman robin matell said management believes the best 
way to reach a settlement with its largest labor union is by 
imposing a 30day deadline 
we believe that mediation would have a much better chance if a 
deadline were set matell said the absence of a deadline has 
been the most critical missing link 
matell said eastern will make a strong effort to reach a 
settlement in the talks next month we want it to succeed and we 
will work hard to make the negotiations successful he said 
bryan declined to discuss the upcoming mediation

the federal government is dusting off 
its plans for offshore gas and oil exploration much to the dismay 
of environmentalists who are gearing up for another standoff along 
the atlantic 
ocean pollution incidents in the past two years have created a 
hypersensitive environment for officials in the department of 
interior which hopes to renew drilling activity in the next several 
years on the east coast 
the ecosystem is certainly as stressed as it can possibly be 
without being in serious jeopardy from offshore drilling said 
cindy zipf coordinator of clean ocean action a coalition of more 
than 100 environmental groups based in sandy hook nj 
beth a millemann director of coast alliance a washingtonbased 
national coalition of environmental activists reacted in like 
fashion 
my heavens what do we have left to wash up she said 
about the only thing we dont have washing up yet is oil perhaps 
they want to make it a full banquet of human waste 
last year the interior department published an inquiry in the 
federal register to assess industry interest in again leasing and 
exploring the offshore area the proposed midatlantic sale area 
extends from rhode island south to north carolina covering more 
than 71 million acres 
it is not the first attempt to explore the region between 1976 
and 1983 32 exploratory wells were drilled in the midatlantic 
region only five produced hydrocarbons indicating oil or gas but 
none in sufficient amounts to make it worth the investment in 
bringing it ashore 
still several oil companies have expressed an interest in more 
exploration the interior department is working on an environmental 
impact statement due to be completed early next year said marcia 
heimberger a spokeswoman for the department the eventual step 
would be to lease tracts again so interested companies could drill 
more exploratory wells she said 
in the meantime concerned citizens should make sure right 
now that their governor and congressional representatives take a 
very firm stand against this because the only thing the interior 
department responds to is political pressure said sarah chasis a 
senior attorney with the natural resources defense council in new 
york 
already several lawmakers have opposed the leasing plan 
when us rep william hughes dnj found out about the 
renewed lease program last year he immediately called for 
revisions he said the new fiveyear program is too heavily weighted 
toward drilling in environmentally sensitive areas and does not 
provide sufficient protections for marine and coastal resources 
this month rep james courter rnj said he would ask 
congress to place a 10year moratorium on oil and gas exploration 
off the new jersey shore 
in the first attempt to drill for oil off the midatlantic 
states consortiums that included giants such as mobil shell sun 
and tenneco capped their wells after spending billions of dollars on 
one too many dry holes so why would the federal government and 
the oil companies want to try to lease such tracts again 
the most important reason is national security ms 
heimberger said were all seeing stories about opec trying to 
withhold production its an energy security issue for us 
particularly in the northern atlantic states one of the largest 
users and importers of natural gas 
in addition even though the fields werent commercially 
producable 10 years ago there have been a lot of technological 
improvements she said it has changed by leaps and bounds 
actually companies are now able to work in much deeper water 
that could be the difference this time according to rutgers 
university geology professor warren manspeizer 
the target area in 1976 was a different sequence of rocks they 
didnt go down deep enough last time he said 
the real gamblers in the venture will ultimately be those who pay 
for the right to explore again for oil and gas 
but thats the nature of the business said joseph a 
lastelic spokesman for the washingtonbased american petroleum 
institute if you quit because of a few dry holes you may be 
leaving a treasure behind 
oil companies are also aware of the need to increase us 
production he said 
were now importing 42 percent of what we use lastelic said 
our production continues to go down and consumption goes up 
both the federal government and the oil companies realistically 
expect opposition however ms zipf and ms millemann for 
instance questioned why the united states is not working to find 
other energy sources and why the federal government relaxed 
restrictions on vehicles that burn a lot of gasoline 
theres much more we could be doing to conserve rather than 
looking for potential new sources ms zipf said 
she pointed to some of the potential dangers from offshore 
drilling including oil spills and dredge remains ms millemann 
said that recent ocean pollution incidents have proven that currents 
pull pollutants toward shore or into prime fishing grounds 
the coast guard estimates they collect 10 percent or less of 
oil from a spill she said 
lastelic in turn explained that the last industry oil spill 
occurred almost 20 years ago and in that interim weve made 
great technological progress in drilling and we now have a whole 
set of environmental laws and inspections 
although he acknowledged that drilling may sometimes stir up the 
ocean bottom close to the platform no one has been able to 
conclude that it drifts far away no one has been able to show 
these muds have done any damage to fish 
in reality the platforms usually attract schools of fish because 
microscopic life clings to the bottom lastelic said 
ms millemann vehemently disagreed that oil drilling hardly 
affects the waters 
the process of extracting oil from underwater creates huge 
quantities of pollutants she said lubricating oils are needed 
to keep the bit going into the ground and they usually use diesel 
oil even though the environmental protection agency has wanted them 
to use mineral oil

whether they come in the form of occult goods aimed 
at teenagers or as amulets sold at mainstream shrines and temples 
lucky charms are a staple of japanese life and a profitable 
business 
each year tens of millions of japanese adults flock to shinto 
shrines and buddhist temples to buy charms said to bring luck or 
ward off nearly any kind of calamity imaginable 
during the threeday new years holiday alone priests at the 
tsurugaoka hachiman shrine in kamakura southwest of tokyo expect 
to sell 300000 lucky arrows according to atsushi takahashi a 
shrine spokesman 
the new years holidays are our busiest season and we expect 
nearly 2 million people to visit takahashi said 
if all the lucky arrows are sold at 800 and 2000 yen 6 and 
16 each the shinto shrine will take in over 2 million and 
arrows are just one of nearly a dozen charms sold at the shrine 
money made from sales of amulets is considered a contribution 
and the shrines and temples pay no tax on the income 
sales of charms are what keep many shrines in the black said 
a priestess at another kamakura shrine but sometimes i wonder 
whether people who buy the amulets arent missing the real point 
which is faith in the divine she said requesting anonymity 
tourist maps are sold at the kamakura train station which show 
the location of major temples and list each ones divine favors 
including business prosperity improved eyesight and even the 
prevention of cancer 
most of the charms are colorful pocketsized pouches which 
contain a talisman or drawing of a deity 
the popularity of amulets may be due to the abundance of money 
in japan and peoples desire for material things said the 
business director of kiyomizudera a major buddhist temple in 
kyoto japans ancient capital 
but we dont consider that as necessarily bad he said 
identifying himself only as s aoki the point is that if they 
didnt have any faith at all they wouldnt come here in the first 
place 
kazushi sano of the association of shinto shrines which 
supervises the nations 80000 shrines said there are no written 
rules regarding amulets but added his organization discourages 
their sale in department stores or other commercial outlets 
that would be rude to the gods sano said 
its hard to judge whether the amulets are effective he 
said because they involve divine powers that people cant always 
understand 
charms and the principle behind them genze goriaku or 
benefit in this world can be traced back for centuries they are an 
integral part of japanese religious faith 
most japanese at times worship in both shinto and buddhist 
settings often holding weddings at shinto shrines and funerals at 
buddhist temples having charms from both faiths at ones home is 
common 
but a recent increase in sales of occult amulets to junior and 
senior high school girls has raised eyebrows in the mass media 
weve been flooded by reporters in the past year said kazuo 
arai an employee of tokyos little witch house 
though not affiliated with either the buddhist or shinto faith 
the shop draws a steady flow of schoolgirls with nearly 200 kinds of 
charms supposed to improve ones popularity or love life 
little witch house itself is small but is run by a company 
which publishes my birthday a monthly teen magazine with a 
circulation of roughly 400000 nationwide much of the magazine is 
devoted to explanations of fortunetelling charms and incantations 
arai said 
the girls come here seeking help with problems they face in 
their daytoday lives he said theyre young inexperienced 
and look to the charms to help them in situations they dont know 
how to handle 
what the girls are doing is basically the same as what adults 
do when they buy charms at shrines arai said adding that they 
may be imitating their parents who can often be found at shrines 
during the examination season buying amulets said to help students 
pass 
most of the charms pendants rings and brooches sell for less 
than 10 
they dont seem to be very serious about the charms effects 
he said and i think they are finding a good balance between 
reality and fantasy 
arai said visitors are told some problems cant be solved by 
magic and employees offer a sympathetic ear to girls who may just 
need to talk about their troubles

litigation will always be the bedrock of the 
american judicial system but many businesses are deciding its not 
for them 
more and more companies that cant resolve their differences by 
negtiation are submitting them to impartial arbitrators who weigh 
both sides and hand down binding decisions 
commercial arbitration cases rose 84 percent from 1983 to last 
year and are still increasing the american arbitration association 
says 
arbitration makes sense in many situations it saves time and 
money and puts complex matters in the hands of trained experts 
instead of untrained unpredictable judges or juries 
the idea of asking 12 uneducated uninformed jurors to try to 
decide an issue that is complex and requires technical training and 
experience in an industry it just doesnt make sense said 
robert coulson president of the arbitration association 
in arbitration coulson said you can pick an arbitrator whos 
expert on the industry or patent law or whatever aspect of 
technical information that is relevant to the case 
arbitration gained credibility when computer rivals international 
business machines corp and fujitsu ltd used it to end a bitter 
dispute over ibms copyrights on mainframe computer software 
ibm has a glorious history of victories in the legal system so 
some analysts said it was foolish of the company to surrender so 
much control over its future to a law professor and a retired 
railroad executive whose judgments are impossible to appeal 
but choosing arbitration probably shaved tens or hundreds of 
millions of dollars from ibms and fujitsus legal fees while 
removing crippling uncertainty over the terms of their competition 
even patent lawyers like the trend mainly because they are so 
overworked they dont mind the competition from arbitrators juries 
simply cant grasp many patent issues said michael blommer 
executive director of the american intellectual property law 
association 
when the constitution was written there werent cases like 
this where the average man couldnt understand the facts blommer 
said 
that was before the days of biotechnology and microelectronics 
in a complex patent case today blommer said if under 
crossexamination somebody is forced to recant or change his 
position the jury might not understand that he even is changing his 
position 
federal judges do a little better but not many of them studied 
science or engineering either the judiciary took a step in the 
right direction in 1982 by sending all patent appeals to the federal 
circuit in washington where many judges are highly trained and have 
expert clerks 
actually most arbitration is on matters other than intellectual 
property disputes labor grievances account for about a third of the 
american arbitration associations business other big areas are 
construction contracts disputes between stockbrokers and clients 
insurance claims and supervision of elections of private 
organizations 
many contracts are being written to include provisions that any 
disputes over them will be submitted to arbitration 
nonbinding arbitration where decisions can be appealed to the 
courts is also growing in popularity the better business bureau 
does it so does the insurance industry courts in 20 to 25 states 
and 10 federal districts have annexes that do arbitration to clear 
out cases that dont need to go before a judge or jury 
trials particularly trials by juries clearly have a place 
criminal cases are obviously not suited to arbitration arbitrators 
are also unsuited to try cases where major societal questions are at 
stake such as the round of lawsuits against cigarette companies 
over health damage from smoking 
even in areas where arbitration is wellsuited there is a cost 
in civil liberties the state of massachusetts in a first is 
trying to prohibit stockbrokers from requiring that their clients 
agree ahead of time to settle disputes by arbitration 
a federal judge last week threw out massachusetts regulatory 
effort but the state vowed to appeal 
compulsory arbitration or arbitration agreements entered into 
by citizens who do not recognize they are forfeiting their 
constitutional right to trial by jury is counter to the american 
system of fair play the association of trial lawyers of america 
said 
americans have not lost their taste for suing the living 
daylights out of each other clearly though arbitration has plenty 
of room to grow 
its exciting to let people take control of their own disputes 
and use their innovation and ideas to resolve them in a practical 
way coulson said

lockheed corp said today it had 
buttressed its takeover defenses following the disclosure that 
dallas investor harold c simmons intended to boost his holdings in 
the aerospace firm 
lockheed spokesman bob slayman refused to say if the changes in a 
2yearold poison pill shareholder rights plan were a direct 
response to simmons move nor would he reveal if lockheed builder 
of the stealth fighter and other military hardware had discussed 
the investment with simmons 
simmons did not immediately respond to a telephone request for 
comment 
according to lockheed simmons valhi inc filed notice under the 
hartscottrodino act that he intended to boost his lockheed stake 
beyond 15 million the trigger point for the acts disclosure 
provisions 
as of the dec 7 filing valhi said it owned 375000 of 
lockheeds 595 million outstanding shares or 063 percent 
a lockheed board vote to tighten the firms takeover defenses was 
taken thursday two weeks after the filing slayman said 
the amendment is intended to heighten the protection afforded 
shareholders against abusive takeover tactics the company said in 
a news release 
the revised plan allows present shareholders to buy newly issued 
stock at a discount if an outsider buys 20 percent or more of the 
common stock those rights can be canceled if the independent 
directors determine the takeover bid is in the best interest of 
shareholders or if the company cancels the rights within 10 days of 
the time outside holdings reach 20 percent 
such poison pill plans are intended to dilute the holdings of a 
potential buyer making a takeover prohibitively expensive 
lockheed with headquarters in this los angeles suburb has 
88000 employees in california georgia new jersey texas and new 
hampshire the nations fourthlargest defense contractor lockheed 
had sales of 113 billion in 1987 
in the first three quarters of this year it reported a net 
profit of 520 million on sales of 76 billion with the profit 
figure boosted significantly by sale of a subsidiary 
besides the f117a stealth fighter its proojects include the 
trident ii nuclear missile the c5b transport plane and work on 
military communications satellites and the strategic defense 
initiative or star wars the company also is a subcontractor for 
design work on nasas space station project

get ready to swallow an increase in coffee prices 
poor growing and harvesting conditions have pushed prices for 
green unroasted coffee beans to their highest levels in two years 
and roasters say theyll pass their higher costs along by raising 
prices about 30 cents a pound 
procter amp gamble co the secondlargest us coffee roaster 
behind philip morris cos general foods division said thursday 
that it would raise wholesale prices of its ground roasted coffees 
by 30 cents a pound on jan 23 
pampg which produces folgers coffee also plans increases of 27 
cents a pound for its 11ounce specialroast flaked coffee and 4 
cents an ounce for its instant coffees 
all i can say is that coffee is a fluctuating market said 
pampg spokeswoman belinda baxter welsh in a telephone interview from 
her office in cincinnati we try very hard not to increase our 
prices any more than we have to but the price of green coffee went 
up 
general foods maker of maxwell house coffee said it had no one 
available to discuss coffee prices but analysts said they expected 
other roasters to follow pampgs lead 
the rise in green coffee prices may filter down even more quickly 
for those who prefer to buy freshly roasted beans from bins at 
gourmet coffee shops said david siefer manager of the coffee amp tea 
exchange a chicago boutique 
siefer said he planned to raise prices by 30 cents a pound on 
dec 26 
its going to hit the gourmet end of the business a little 
sooner than it may be reflected in the major coffee companies he 
said 
we dont have quite the capital the major companies have they 
buy by the 37500pound containerload but we generally have less 
than 2000 pounds on hand 
cash prices for green coffee from brazil the worlds largest 
producer have soared this month as the seasonal rise in north 
american consumption focused attention on supply problems ranging 
from drought conditions in brazil to a raindelayed harvest in 
colombia 
in just the past two weeks the price of brazilian coffee in the 
new york harbor surged to 145 a pound from 117 a pound during 
the same period coffee for march delivery on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange leaped from about 127 a pound to about 
149 a pound 
the tightsupply picture eased somewhat late in the past week a 
10day brazilian dockworkers strike ended on thursday and the 
15day moving average of overall coffee prices rose above 1144 a 
pound triggering a 1million bag increase in the amount of coffee 
that producing countries are allowed to export under the rules of 
the international coffee organization 
but analysts say supplies of coffee remain very tight 
in early 1986 under similar conditions green coffee futures 
prices rose to nearly 280 a pound 
we are not up there yet but we may get up there said arthur 
stevenson a coffeemarket analyst with prudentialbache securities 
inc in new york it depends how much further these weather 
conditions bite into production 
but stevenson said prices were unlikely to return to the levels 
of 1976 when coffee futures peaked above 330 a pound 
that was the year of a major frost in brazil a major 
calamity he said the causes there were somewhat different

sending the tobacco companys stock up 22 percent on rumors of a 
takeover by unilever the britishdutch consumer products 
conglomerate 
both companies declined to discuss the rumors citing policies 
against commenting on speculation one rumor said unilever might pay 
as much as 90 a share for american brands 
american brands got as high as 7025 a share and was at 6712 
in late trading on wall street up 950 or 16 percent 
allan kaplan an analyst for merrill lynch amp co said the rumor 
was hard to substantiate ive called a number of arbitragers that 
are very well tuned in and nobody knows he said 
if it came through a purchase by unilever would continue the 
trend of foreign takeovers as well as the trend of mergers in the 
tobacco and food businesses in one such case pillsbury co last

riklis family corp 
eiis offering price for american brands last spring was 55 a

american brands was about 95 a share based on an estimate that 
investors would be willing to pay about nine times its operating 
cash flow minus debt

air travelers in the minneapolisst paul area 
paid much higher fares to some destinations in the year after the 
local market became dominated by one airline according to a report 
published friday 
in a review of 27 routes where competition was reduced by 
northwest airlines 1986 merger with republic airlines average 
fares rose on 23 routes sometimes by more than 40 percent the star 
tribune reported 
on all northwest flights in and out of the twin cities a 
separate study shows the average fare rose 185 percent six times 
the national average in the year after the merger the newspaper 
said 
northwest based in eagan minn disputes the findings airline 
officials said no broad conclusions could be drawn using isolated 
fare comparisons the airline generated new data showing that 
northwest flights were less expensive than similar flights from 
other airports by other carriers 
in addition northwests study found passengers flying to the 
twin cities saved money over those connecting to other destinations 
northwest also said that like most airlines it was earning thin 
profit margins 
many factors help explain fare increases but alfred kahn the 
architect of us airline deregulation said the broad pattern 
indicated in the newspapers study of northwests fares appears to 
conform with every major study with which i am familiar when 
airline concentration increases he said fares tend to rise

street powerhouse drexel burnham lambert inc isnt expected to 
bring a major shakeup in the market for junk bonds pioneered and 
dominated by drexel 
still market players are taking a cautious waitandsee 
attitude 
us attorney rudolph w giuliani announced this past wednesday 
that drexel had reversed itself by agreeing to admit guilt to six 
felonies and pay a record 650 million fine to settle the biggest 
securities fraud case in history 
expectations of a drexel settlement had grown in recent days and 
the 180 billion market for highrisk highyield junk bonds wasnt 
taken by surprise in fact bond traders seemed relieved that the 
business was over after dragging on for two years and the investment 
firm had decided not to wage a risky fight 
a flight to quality out of junk bonds and into conventional 
securities which had been predicted in some quarters as a result of 
the drexel debacle failed to materialize 
prices of highyield bonds were mostly little changed and even 
slightly higher in some cases in quiet trading 
but a sort of edgy calm appeared to hang over the market as 
traders looked toward the new year and postsettlement prospects 
most people are taking a waitandsee attitude said robert 
levine president of highyield asset management at kidder peabody amp 
co 
market players are watching for further developments in the 
governments investigation that could prompt some junk bond traders 
at drexel to leave the firm 
this isnt over said a market expert who asked not to be 
identified he noted anxiety that the investigation could envelop 
some of drexels clients who include many wellknown takeover 
strategists 
some of those clients said privately this past week they still 
needed to review whether the pleabargaining arrangement would 
change their close business relationship with drexel 
that traders fear could potentially affect drexels ability to 
continue to sell mammoth junk bond issues such as the one being 
used to help finance the 245 billion leveraged buyout of rjr 
nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
the market points to the nabisco issue as evidence that drexel is 
still a force to be reckoned with 
the other players in the junk bond market notably merrill lynch 
capital markets prudentialbache securities inc goldman sachs amp 
co and first boston corp might lack the clout of dominant drexel 
in selling huge issues some experts suggest 
i dont really think were going to see a sea change in the 
market said ray lemanski director of highyield securities 
research at prudentialbache 
there shouldnt be a major change in terms of the volume of junk 
issues coming to market or their prices and yields lemanski said 
but he and other observers conceded that some segments of the market 
could be affected by traders leaving drexel 
in addition to mega issues like nabisco junk bonds at the 
other end of the spectrum worth less than 100 million or so also 
could present a problem analysts say thats because the effort and 
expense involved in researching the companies issuing small bonds 
has kept all the players except drexel from bothering with them 
some of the smaller issues could come under pressure 
lemanski said

lockheed corp said friday it had shored 
up its takeover defenses after dallas investor harold c simmons 
disclosed he might boost his stake in the aerospace company 
but simmons said he considered his stake in lockheed builder of 
the stealth fighter and other military hardware an investment only 
its not that big a deal we have no intention of trying to 
buy the whole company simmons said in a telephone interview 
simmons valhi inc filed notice dec 7 under the 
hartscottrodino act that he intended to boost his lockheed stake 
beyond 15 million the trigger point for the acts disclosure 
provisions 
lockheed spokesman bob slayman refused to say if changes in the 
companys 2yearold poison pill shareholder rights plan were a 
direct response to simmons move 
at the time of the filing valhi said it owned 375000 of 
lockheeds 595 million outstanding shares or 063 percent 
simmons said the filing was intended to give him leeway to buy 
more lockheed stock with money anticipated from the planned sale of 
his amalgamated sugar co to a british firm however that 300 
million deal fell through he said 
the investor said he had not discussed the matter with lockheed 
officials 
a lockheed board vote to tighten the firms takeover defenses was 
taken thursday two weeks after the filing slayman said 
the revised plan allows present shareholders to buy newly issued 
stock at a discount if an outsider buys 20 percent or more of the 
common stock 
such poison pill plans are intended to dilute the holdings of a 
potential buyer making a takeover prohibitively expensive 
lockheed with headquarters in this los angeles suburb has 
88000 employees in california georgia new jersey texas and new 
hampshire the nations fourthlargest defense contractor lockheed 
had sales of 113 billion in 1987 
in the first three quarters of this year it reported a net 
profit of 520 million on sales of 76 billion with the profit 
figure boosted significantly by sale of a subsidiary 
projects include the topsecret f117a stealth fighter the 
trident ii nuclear missile the c5b transport plane and work on 
military communications satellites and the strategic defense 
initiative or star wars the company also is a subcontractor for 
design work on nasas space station project

speculation grew friday that the historic plea 
deal sparing drexel burnham lambert inc from a wideranging 
indictment excludes insider trading charges and omits names of at 
least some individual lawbreakers 
sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said the 
pact was structured to minimize the investment giants exposure to 
private civil lawsuits and put the staggering securities fraud case 
behind it for good 
but few specifics of the settlement could be learned and by late 
friday no formal document had been filed by the manhattan us 
attorneys office drexel spokesman steven anreder said it was 
unclear when details would be released 
drexel agreed to settle the biggest fraud case in wall street 
history wednesday by paying a record 650 million in fines and 
restitution to the government and pleading guilty to six felony 
counts 
the new york times quoting unidentified drexel employees 
reported friday that the six counts would concern alleged 
manipulations of stock in stone container corp fischbach corp 
mca inc and comb co as well as stock parking violations 
in phillips petroleum co and harris graphics corp 
stock parking involves hiding ownership of stock in someone 
elses name to avoid securities and exchange commission disclosure 
requirements 
five of the transactions mentioned by the times involved drexels 
relationship with ivan f boesky the nowimprisoned inside trader 
who implicated the firm and its highyield bond financier michael 
milken when boesky himself was exposed more than two years ago 
the comb transaction was said to involve drexels 
relationship with princeton newport partners a small new jersey 
securities concern that was dissolved earlier this month because of 
racketeering and fraud charges against five of its principals and a 
former drexel bond trader 
pleading guilty to manipulation and parking charges is considered 
less serious than insider trading which is the use of nonpublic 
information to profit in securities dealings 
lawyers said these pleas likely would lessen drexels 
vulnerability to multiple lawsuits by private investors since it is 
difficult to prove financial losses resulted from such wrongdoing 
the times asserted that none of the charges would specifically 
name any people who committed wrongdoing which could further 
insulate the firm and the individuals from civil litigation 
but sources reached by the associated press said it wasnt clear 
whether individuals would be named suggesting this was still an 
unresolved matter 
the plea agreement capped an investigation of the wall street 
giant that snowballed into the biggest securities fraud probe ever 
and raised disturbing questions about the extent of greed and 
conflicts of interest among the big dealers in the investment 
banking business 
the agreement still requires approval from the justice department 
and sec which has accused drexel milken and other employees of far 
more widespread and insidious charges in a civil suit filed nearly 
four months ago 
there was no word friday on whether the sec would seek additional 
sanctions against drexel before consenting to the plea agreement and 
dropping the suit 
but there was widespread speculation that the enforcement agency 
would require the expulsion of milken from the securities business 
and would likely impose stiff restraints on the operations of 
drexels west coast highyield bond department which milken 
currently heads 
drexels agreement to cooperate in the government investigation 
greatly increases pressure on milken himself to settle asyet 
unfiled charges against him which reportedly include racketeering 
counts that carry enormous fines and lengthy prison terms if he is 
convicted 
but spokesmen for milken said friday that he was still 
maintaining his innocence and if indicted he would vindicate 
himself in court
