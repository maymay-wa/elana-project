the newspaper heiress sat smiling in a posh 
manhattan hotel suite answering questions about her past as an 
urban guerrilla and her present status as a suburban housewife 
the whole business gets stirred up every five or 10 years 
anyway patricia hearst shaw said as she sipped a glass of 
mineral water and then six months from now theyll have 
forgotten what i look like again and that will be that 
whats stirring up things now is paul schraders patty 
hearst based on her recently rereleased book patty hearst 
her own story which tells the story of her 1974 san francisco 
kidnapping by the symbionese liberation army 
hearsts two daughters lydia 3 and gillian 7 will see 
actress natasha richardson posing as mommy hold a rifle while 
robbing a california bank 
it was something i knew would be done she said of the 
movie and so when producer marvin worth came and said he 
wanted to use the book and make a film i thought well this is 
kind of my best chance if its going to happen its going to 
happen 
besides hearst said one of her two daughters already knows the 
tale of tania the name given to her by sla head donald defreeze 
also known as field marshal cinque he and five other sla members 
died in a shootout with police three months after the kidnapping 
my eldest does only because she came home from the bus one day 
and asked about it someone on the bus had told her about it she 
said she wasnt that interested in it you know 
she was kind of shocked that it had really happened she 
couldnt believe it and shes never said anything about it again 
hearst is the daughter of randolph a hearst chairman of the 
board of the hearst corp which owns an assortment of newspapers 
radio stations magazines and television stations across the 
country her grandfather william randolph hearst was the subject 
of orson welles acclaimed film citizen kane 
the kidnapping was more a matter of expediency than anything 
else her name had been in the newspaper announcing her engagement 
to steven weed along with the fact she was attending university of 
california at berkeley the kidnappers pulled a card with her 
address from a public file at school 
they never did ask for ransom hearst said im really 
hardpressed to say what they the sla were thinking about they 
were saying well we would have kidnapped your father except he 
was so much more heavily protected and i thought oh please 
its the same as everybody else they kidnap or injure women and 
children because its easier i dont know what politically their 
goal was supposed to be 
as a gesture of good faith on behalf of his daughter hearst 
established a 2 million program called people in need which 
distributed food to the needy throughout california the sla 
leaders never responded to the program initially they demanded 
that 70 worth of food go to every needy person in the state 
patricia hearst has had her familys support throughout 
i was surprised because with the sla they were busy 
convincing me that not only had my family abandoned me they would 
never want to see me again she said 
she maintained in the interview as she has all along that she 
was brainwashed and totally under the sway of the sla because of 
its mental and physical torture of her 
the abduction was frontpage news the subsequent events two 
bank robberies one slaying 19 months on the run rumors the whole 
thing was staged her arrest trial conviction and presidential 
pardon seemed almost like a movie as they occurred 
if you werent reading about me you were reading about the 
watergate hearings or someone else going to prison or being 
indicted said hearst who appeared on the cover of newsweek 
seven times in two years i guess it just fit right in there with 
all the other political drama that was taking place at the time 
she was arrested in september 1975 convicted of participating 
in the bank robbery and received a sevenyear prison sentence 
president carter pardoned her in 1979 she married bernard shaw 
her former bodyguard and they have been living in westport conn 
for the past four years 
hearst wasnt involved in the making of the movie although she 
did meet once with richardson and she has viewed the finished 
product did it bring back bad memories 
yes and no she said its really so different for me to 
try and look at it as an objective observer so i havent really 
spent any time thinking how does this make me feel its more like 
what am i seeing up there 
hearst has changed dramatically from the 21yearold who raised 
a clenched fist for photographers after her arrest by the fbi who 
listed her occupation as urban guerrilla who was labeled a 
common criminal by us attorney general william saxbe 
now 34 she lives quietly with her husband and children 
occasionally returning to san francisco for such events as the 
opening of the opera season 
the flashbacks that plagued her after the kidnapping violent 
dreams where she would kill sla comrades bill and emily harris 
are gone she giggles nervously about the events of the past 
although she acknowledges that discussing them can be disquieting 
i dont like it much hearst said 
and shes hopeful the release of the movie can be the final 
chapter in the hearst case 
to those who remain skeptical about her story she says i 
think the movie is like reading my book and saying theres still 
questions that arent answered well i guess only if you cant 
stand what you read if you wanted to hear something else

director paul schrader believes a good movie 
should make good dinner conversation 
and maybe thats the goal of this movie not to solve the 
case said schrader of his latest project the film patty 
hearst 
while tidy endings abound elsewhere patty hearst stops just 
where it starts atop a stack of questions with few explanations 
about why a kidnapped heiress became a selfproclaimed urban 
guerrilla final conclusions about guilt or innocence as schrader 
sees it should be made back at home over roast beef mashed 
potatoes and buttered green beans 
such ambiguity marks a change of course for the filmmaker when 
writing taxi driver raging bull and the last temptation 
of christ schrader dealt with visceral emotions with patty 
hearst he has made a movie whose loudest voice is ambivalence 
but that he thinks is what daily decisions are sometimes 
about movies offer us problems but life offers us dilemmas 
he said in an interview its always easier watching movies 
because there is a problem and they get rid of the problem 
schraders career like that of any demanding filmmaker has 
been marked by both triumphs and spills even those who didnt see 
robert de niro in 1976s taxi driver can quote schraders 
dialogue verbatim you talkin to me but who remembers 1987s 
light of day 
he also did an erotic remake of cat people in 1981 starring 
nastassja kinski malcolm mcdowell and john heard 
a michigan native he graduated from the university of 
california at los angeles film school and lives in new york with 
his wife actress mary beth hurt since he began work in 1974 by 
writing the screenplay for sidney pollacks the yakuza about 
japanese gangsters schrader has been drawn repeatedly to colorful 
and controversial figures 
i didnt really know the answer to the hearst dilemma 
before he said and i still dont that was one of the things 
i had to accept in making the film the answer to did she or 
didnt she is yes and no you try to present that mystery to the 
audience but when i tried to weigh the argument to one side or the 
other i found that it rang false yes she was turned into a 
political revolutionary no that wasnt patty hearst for every 
statement there is an equally valid counterstatement 
when hearst told her story in the book every secret thing 
she said the symbionese liberation army brainwashed her during her 
1974 ordeal schraders movie while adapted by nicholas kazan from 
the book takes a slightly different tack patty hearst 
balances the scales suggesting that hearst may have made a choice 
in her own destiny 
it looked interesting from the outside kidnapping bank 
robbery shootout but then you got in it and you say wait 
theres no story schrader said you can imagine that if she 
had died in watts during the shootout that killed six sla members 
what the mythology machine would have made of her she would have 
been tania the grand revolutonary hero 
but there are some massive limits here the story is 
dramatically deficient you care about people who do things 
this girl doesnt do anything she doesnt act she is acted upon 
it runs against the commercial essence of cinema 
to make patty hearst as compelling as possible schrader 
spun out a visually inventive narrative it sticks to the facts 
but with odd camera angles cyclical music and eerie gothic sets 
he cast british actress natasha richardson daughter of vanessa 
redgrave in the title role 
if i did a docudrama it would just lie there he said 
this called for a hand of authorship i am telling her story and 
i have to acknowledge that the first pronoun in that sentence is as 
important as the second 
odd though it may sound there are similarities between hearst 
and some of schraders earlier protagonists 
in a way shes a socially marginable character too 
schrader said and ive always enjoyed taking a point of view of 
someone whos sort of on the margins of society a psychopathic 
cab driver taxi driver a homosexual suicidal novelist 
mishima the boxer jake lamotta raging bull jesus the 
last temptation and say lets take their point of view lets 
see the world as they see it 
one of the things that the movie sort of says at the end is 
here we have this empty vessel who everyone turns into a symbol 
for their own purposes and at the end of the movie she says 
look i hate to disappoint you but im just me and im not that 
interesting

the courtordered removal of children from the 
bethel home for children due to suspicion of brutality and neglect 
infuriated founder herman fountain who bitterly regretted his 
failure to defy authorities in the name of church rights before 
the battle of bethel was over he would have another chance to do 
just that this is the third and concluding installment of gates 
of hell 
</TEXT>

fridays raid at the bethel home for 
children was followed by mondays last stand 
over the weekend word reached judge robert oswald that some of 
the children who had fled police had returned to bethel he ordered 
authorities back to the church to retrieve any children they could 
find 
bethel founder herman fountain in youth court awaiting further 
hearing testimony caught wind of the action and ordered his staff 
to ignore the subpoenas that had summoned them and return to 
bethel there would be no compromise on this day 
fountain locked the church doors barricading three dozen 
parents and children in the church they had built by hand dozens 
of state troopers and sheriffs deputies stood by for more than 
three hours while welfare commissioner thomas brittain jr tried 
to negotiate the childrens release 
police finally broke in and took the children while church 
members recited bible verse and sang hymns 
if god be for us who can be against us read the bethel sign 
by the road 
fountain his eldest son herman jr nicknamed bubba and 
brother david owens were among eight people arrested that day 
fountain faces three counts of felonious assault on a police 
officer and one count of inciting a riot all scheduled to be 
presented to the grand jury later this month 
troubles seemed to overrun the pastor like the locusts of 
pharaohs egypt a former bethel resident rhonnda traxler 
gathered reporters outside the courthouse and alleged fountain 
sexually molested her and another girl while they were at bethel 
fountain denied the accusation and leveled his own you cant 
believe this girl theres no telling how many men shes been 
with 
another former bethel child ray friery filed a 1 million 
federal lawsuit against fountain alleging assault and battery 
abuse neglect and false imprisonment 
fountain wasnt the only one with problems many state workers 
involved in the case received harassing phone calls or believed 
they were being followed by bethel supporters 
brittain sent his 13yearold daughter out of state after 
anonymous callers threatened to kidnap her and put her in a church 
home where she would never be found again 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
before the youth court hearings ended about half of the more 
than 70 children taken from bethel had testified some were too 
frightened to appear 
theyre really wicked little kids fountain said in a later 
interview with the associated press im talking about 
homosexuals im talking about lesbians im talking about 
prostitutes im talking about one boy who raped his 84yearold 
grandmother im talking about one who murdered his sister 
im talking habitual runaways im talking car thieves im 
talking nymphomaniacs 
brittain dealt with the same youngsters but saw something 
different 
for the most part theyre pretty normal kids who have been 
battered around by life pretty badly the welfare commissioner 
said theyre children trying to put their lives back together 
some parents had despaired of getting help from state agencies 
for them bethel was a last resort for others it was a matter of 
convenience one child was sent to bethel because he took food 
from the refrigerator brittain said 
but as the hearing continued after the raid on bethel some 
parents sat in the courtroom and wept overwhelmed by stories of 
hairpulling faceslapping laprunning and switchings a 
13yearold girl with downs syndrome said she ran laps all day 
long received frequent spankings and sometimes stood for hours on 
tiptoe with her chin above a light switch 
they said she was a little brat and had a demon in her 
another girl said parents agreed with it they said thats what 
you deserve if youve acted in a wrong way 
some parents said they were misled they didnt know what bethel 
really was other parents knew exactly what bethel was 
when i went down there i was totally convinced what had 
occurred was not morally right legally right or anyway right 
said jack hicks of birdsboro pa but his two teenage sons support 
fountain and they changed his mind

<TEXT>
they love the man tremendously if my children said to me 
dad thats not the way it was they were cruel and abused us 
id be after brother fountain he said but theyve solidified 
my support 
about 50 of the children were released to their parents who 
signed a court agreement not to return them to bethel without the 
judges approval protecting the children this way was about all 
the state and judge oswald could do since bethel is a private 
unregulated facility 
now a dozen parents including hicks are preparing a lawsuit 
against the state for its action at bethel 
i look at this much beyond just an incident that occurred in 
the state of mississippi hicks said lets term it religious 
harassment 
 
life is slow at bethel these days with so few children around 
the home remains open but rows of girls bunk beds stand empty 
except for the stuffed bears and rabbits left behind by former 
occupants 
a few new children have come since the hearings a few former 
residents have returned 
no winner has emerged from the emotional battle over bethel 
which begins and ends with a collision of convictions 
brittain and his team of investigators oswald and prosecutor 
mark maples consider it a matter of child protection 
herman fountain his faithful flock and other fundamentalists 
who came to lend support have called it an issue of religious 
freedom 
conservative religious belief courses through mississippis 
veins and beats fiercely in its heart the perception that the 
state is venturing into the realm of the church makes blood run 
hot but so does the perception that church home operators are 
using fundamental religion and the bible as justification to abuse 
and neglect children 
im a christian theyre supposed to be christians said 
welfare investigator kathy prine who teaches sunday school at her 
baptist church i believe this is wrong these kids are being 
physically abused these people claim the kids are liars and are 
not being abused but are being raised by what the bible says 
it makes you question your faith and your job when we went in 
there i asked someone am i hurting the church am i hurting 
gods work by doing this i thought about it and i said no no 
im not 
oswald in his order removing the children from bethel wrote 
if there is a conflict of interests between religion and the 
protection of children this courts decision must be to protect 
first the children 
fountain sees it another way i dealt with oswald in 
chambers about his soul he says the laws of the land are first 
and that the bibles second fountain said i said thats 
wrong that bibles first and the law of the land is second 
mississippi along with north carolina south carolina 
louisiana missouri and florida has no law licensing churchrun 
boarding homes although some voluntarily apply for licenses 
as a result there is no way to reach many of the children in 
such homes many of whom are denied communication with the outside 
for months at a time or to ensure that basic educational 
sanitation and safety standards are met 
weve had to wait years to collect information in bits and 
pieces from runaway children brittain said we have no way of 
knowing whats going on inside those four walls 
maples has filed a court petition to force bethel to comply with 
state laws governing education safety standards and child labor 
laws the court has yet to act on it if enforced such an order 
could close bethel because fountain has said he would never 
cooperate 
for the two years he has been welfare commissioner brittain has 
pushed for a law to open the doors of homes like bethel fountain 
has prayed against one 
this might well be the year that the power of prayer is overcome 
by the power of politics observers agree that outrage over 
conditions at bethel has been so great that the legislature might 
be forced to act 
even fountain agrees saying it would take an act of god to 
prevent a licensure law from emerging in the next legislative 
session 
at bethel they will be praying round the clock 
theyre going against god and thats their problem thats 
why were going to win fountain said the gates of hell aint 
going to prevail against our church

kopkamtib was abolished recently by a 
keppres which created bakorstanas to take its place 
the acronym some would call it alphabet soup is alive and 
kicking in indonesia what happened recently in translation from 
indonesian acronymania is this 
the operational command for the restoration of security and 
order kopkamtib or komando operasi pemulihan keamanan dan 
ketertiban was abolished by a presidential decree keppres or 
keputusan president which created in its place the coordinating 
agency for assisting the strengthening of national stability 
bakorstanas or badan koordinasi bantuan pemantapan stabilitas 
nasional 
acronyms and abbreviations are a national craze used to 
condense unwieldy phrases but serving in many other cases to 
compound confusion 
for one thing it is common if not preferable to use the first 
syllable instead of the first letter of words as with keppres 
the main political party is called golkar which is short for 
golongan karya and comes out in english as functional groups 
headline writers delight in the convenience offered by the 
thousands of short forms but to the uninitiated the front pages of 
indonesian newspapers resemble a lexicographers nightmare 
acronyms also are found in telephone books and on the doors of 
government offices standard dictionaries offer no help 
many say the use of acronyms first spread during the 
administration 194966 of president sukarno known familiarly as 
bung karno for brother sukarno 
during the sukarno years the habit was applied to english 
phrases as well as the national tongue bahasa indonesia 
the term neocolonial imperialism was cut to necolim 
a sports tournament for third world athletes became known as 
ganefo games of the newly emerging forces 
communist china became cinkom 
blame or credit for entrenching linguistic short cuts is usually 
pinned on the armed forces or the abri 
as early as 1976 professor takdir alisjahbana warned that the 
influential military was coining so many acronyms that the standard 
of bahasa indonesia might deteriorate he said such usage added 
nothing to the stock of new ideas but only increased the burden on 
the memory 
one magazine editor cautioned his staff about shortening jaksa 
agung attorney general to jagung which means popcorn 
there are acronyms for most government departments and senior 
officials 
the presidents personal assistants are aspri short for 
asisten pribadi president 
the alphabet soup is sometimes flavored with numbers 
p3 is what people sometimes call the opposition political group 
partai persatuan pembangunan united development party 
then theres bp7 badan pembinaan pendidikan pelaksanaan 
pedoman penghayatan dan pengamalan pancasila 
thats the board for guidance on the means of teaching 
guidelines for the true interpretation and implementation of the 
state ideology

nine months after the dona paz sank 
in the worst peacetime shipping disaster the death toll remains a 
mystery and secrecy surrounds official investigations into the 
cause of the accident 
the 2215ton dona paz collided dec 20 with the 629ton oil 
tanker vector off mindoro island both vessels exploded in huge 
fireballs 
only 26 of the 1775 people known to be on board the vessels 
were saved but the real death toll may never be known 
manifests on interisland vessels are notoriously inaccurate 
they often record children as half passengers or disregard them 
entirely corrupt officials frequently accept bribes to allow 
overloading 
in addition many victims probably were incinerated when the 
vessels exploded and will never be accounted for rescuers found 
only 108 bodies many of them charred and mutilated beyond 
recognition 
sulpicio lines owner of the dona paz has never officially 
acknowledged that the passenger ship carried more than the 1583 
people listed on the manifest 
but vicente gambito a sulpicio lines vice president says the 
company has paid claims to relatives of 2748 people he said each 
claimant received 1500 in exchange for agreeing not to file suits 
or seek additional compensation 
another 1642 claims are being processed 
uncertainty of just who was on the ship has led to fraud 
gambito said one man was jailed after receiving a settlement then 
returning with claims for another 13 relatives some 
relatives turned up in the united states and were not even 
related to the claimant gambito said 
what were trying to play here is a percentage game he 
said there is no way that we can with finality prove or 
disprove that a person was on board so we are taking chances 
the dona paz was authorized to carry 1518 passengers and a crew 
of 60 the vector carried 13 crewmen two of whom survived 
most aboard the dona paz were poor people from the islands of 
samar and leyte who planned to spend christmas with relatives in 
manila 
gambito said payment of claims does not necessarily mean the 
company admits the claimants relatives were aboard the dona paz 
he said five applications proved false 
but rosario marasigan an assistant director of the department 
of social welfare and member of the government task force said she 
believes most of the claims settled by the company were genuine 
both houses of congress have completed separate investigations 
but have not acted on their findings 
both congressional reports found virtually everything about 
philippine shipping wrong they cited obsolete ships and navigation 
charts poor or nonexistent communication and navigational aids 
lax enforcement of safety regulations and poorly trained crews 
officials say there would have probably been no survivors if 
three merchant ships had not been in the area when the collision 
occurred they picked up the survivors 
the philippine coast guard has not released findings of the 
official investigation conducted by its board of marine inquiry 
board members mostly retired civilian seamen said they submitted 
their findings to the coast guard in march 
the coast guard in manila 110 miles north of the collision 
received first word of the tragedy eight hours after it happened 
it took another eight hours to launch search and rescue operations 
one of the many unanswered questions is whether the dona paz 
sent out a distress call none of the crew survived and no radio 
station reported any distress signal 
to check the effectiveness of the receiving system national 
telecommunications commission chief jose luis alcuaz boarded a ship 
a few weeks after the disaster and sent an sos from the collision 
site no coast guard station acknowledged receipt 
members of the marine board refuse to discuss their findings 
law requires that findings be forwarded to the coast guard 
commandant for review and release 
lt cmdr makaraig cuevas a coast guard spokesman said the 
papers were being reviewed 
asked why a report had not been released col victor corpuz 
the coast guard official reviewing the findings replied the 
commandant has not signed it why are you interested he then 
hung up

raoul wallenberg disappeared during the last 
days of world war ii after saving thousands of jews the soviets 
say he died in prison in 1957 but reports persist that hes still 
alive 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
raoul wallenberg is a ghost in the 
soviet prison system officially declared dead by moscow he is a 
faint shadow who over the last 43 years has wandered through 
prisons mental hospitals and labor camps 
whether dead or alive the swedish diplomat lives at least for 
those who admire his courage in saving thousands of people from 
nazi death camps during world war ii he would be 76 
rumors reaching his family say wallenberg arrested by the 
soviets in budapest hungary in the waning days of the war was 
still living in an isolation cell earlier this year 
we have indications thats all we can say without endangering 
people they are not witnesses only indications said his 
halfsister nina lagergren 
the soviets never explained why they arrested wallenberg but it 
is likely they suspected him of being an american spy the kremlin 
later expressed regret 
we cannot have a question in our minds that he is alive 
said mrs lagergren 67 in an interview how could we work for 
40 years for his freedom if there was a doubt in our minds we have 
to believe 
mrs lagergren who runs the raoul wallenberg committee of 
sweden clings to any reason for hope 
in soviet prisons she said people can survive a long time 
it may be cynical to call it good but there is no stress from 
daily life you dont overeat you dont drink or smoke humans 
have a fantastic ability to adapt 
swedish author kenne fant whose novel r based on 
wallenbergs imprisonment was published in august said he 
believes the prisoners records have been destroyed and that his 
identity may be lost forever 
pressure to find wallenberg persists 
we raise the question at every opportunity said vollrath 
tham the foreign ministry official in charge of the wallenberg 
file the us and israeli governments also are active 
on sept 16 warren zimmermann us delegation chief at the 
vienna conference on security and cooperation in europe demanded 
a full and open accounting of wallenbergs fate 
soviet spokesman gennady gerasimov replying four days later at 
a news briefing in moscow said that according to a handwritten 
report found in 1957 in the lubyanka prison archives wallenberg 
died in 1947 of a heart attack two years after his arrest it said 
he was cremated 
there is nothing new in it said mrs lagergren they have 
repeated it for 30 years and if you study it its quite 
unbelievable even they concede there is no evidence that raoul is 
dead 
mrs lagergren said she hoped for a new probe of the case 
because she believed the soviets were interested in clearing the 
record on the crimes of the stalin era 
when he was 32 wallenberg went to budapest at the suggestion of 
the us war refugee board besides providing passports and safe 
houses for jews he dissuaded the nazis from blowing up the 
jewish ghetto before evacuating the city saving its 70000 
residents from probable death 
wallenberg had been in hungary six months when he was arrested 
many hungarian jews credited wallenberg for their survival 
fant said that while researching his novel he spoke with 
someone whom he did not identify who heard wallenberg was seen 
dec 22 1986 in the southcentral labor camp of blagoveshchenka 
a closed city in the soviet union 
fant told reporters in august his source has been in touch 
with a person who saw a bent old man at the labor camp who was 
being treated for frostbite on his right foot this man was 
described by fellow inmates as the one who saved jews in budapest 
in 1974 wallenberg was reported seen in the siberian camp of 
vadivovo he was described as an oldlooking man with thin white 
hair who had been ill 
sweden questioned the soviets about wallenberg in 1956 and again 
in 1965 but let the case lie dormant until a new eyewitness 
account surfaced in 1978 
under pressure from israel president jimmy carter raised the 
issue at the 1979 summit with soviet leader leonid brezhnev 
that was during the detente period we hoped that raoul would 
be back within a year said mrs lagergren 
gorbachevs glasnost policy has revived hope said mrs 
lagergren her other brother guy von dardel was in the soviet 
union in june and he felt the atmosphere had changed they were 
much more open and cooperative she said

republican george bush hints that rival 
michael dukakis might get advice from the american civil liberties 
union on filling supreme court vacancies while democratic critics 
suggest that bush will be bound by a gop platform plank insisting 
upon judges who oppose abortion 
but beyond the campaign rhetoric both candidates respond in a 
similar fashion on the question of naming justices both insist 
they wont apply an ideological litmus test to their choices 
i think if you ask people in my state theyll tell you that 
my record is a strong one dukakis said last week i look for 
people of intelligence and integrity i dont ask them what their 
party affiliation is 
bush has said he will appoint judges who have more sympathy 
for the victims of crime and less for the criminals 
but asked specifically last week if he would heed that gop 
platform plank calling for the appointment of judges who respect 
traditional family values and the sanctity of innocent human 
life bush said 
i dont want to have a specific objective for a judge i 
want people who will interpret the constitution and not legislate 
from the bench i would not have a litmus test criteria id 
keep it very general he said 
as the supreme court opens its 198889 term today the question 
of the kind of individuals each candidate would appoint to the high 
court is percolating as a campaign issue 
in appearances last week the vice president repeatedly 
challenged dukakis to say whether he would follow the advice of the 
aclu in selecting supreme court justices 
i think its a good question to ask all he has to say is no 
they wont have any influence on him bush said in michigan on 
thursday 
the vice president has sought to portray dukakis as an 
ultraliberal because of the democrats own characterization of 
himself last year as a cardcarrying member of the aclu the 
organization often has defended the freespeech rights of groups 
advocating unpopular causes and bush contends it has a liberal 
agenda 
the next president seems likely to put a major stamp on the 
makeup of the ninemember court bush has said that the 41st 
president will very possibly appoint two or three justices to the 
supreme court where theyll sit well into the next century 
when the next president takes office the three oldest and most 
liberal justices will be over 80 william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and harry a blackmun 
dukakis was asked in an april interview with the village voice 
whom he particularly respected among the supreme court justices 
his choices louis d brandeis served l91639 hugo l black 
19371971 william o douglas 19391975 brennan 1956 and 
marshall 1967 all were considered liberals 
voice columnist nat hentoff cited a 1986 tribute by bush to the 
late potter stewart served 195881 who is considered a 
middleofthe roader 
potter thought it important not to succumb to ideological 
labels bush said and then quoted stewart your boss is only 
the constitution and the law but they can be and should be 
very very strict bosses 
as governor of massachusetts dukakis has appointed more than 
100 judges ranging from municipal court justices to the supreme 
judicial court of massachusetts 
the september issue of the american lawyer quotes sheldon 
goldman a university of massachusetts law professor as saying the 
judges dukakis has appointed generally have been cautiously 
liberal or moderately progressive 
the supreme court in recent years has become increasingly 
conservative 
still even though president reagan made three appointments to 
the court sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony kennedy 
he will not leave quite the stamp on the court that some liberals 
had feared 
each of his appointments replaced justices who were either 
moderate or conservative and reagan did not have a chance to 
replace a liberal with a conservative member 
says dukakis these are lifetime appointments these are 
appointments that have to be made very carefully there is 
nothing a president does that leaves a more lasting legacy than the 
appointment of justices to the supreme court

the shadow of a leftist military ruler and his 
revolutionary government still hovers over peru 20 years after he 
seized power with tanks and troops and left an indelible stamp on 
peruvian life 
gen juan velasco a stocky career soldier and fiery speaker 
toppled perus democratic government on oct 3 1968 and forced 
thenpresident fernando belaunde into a lengthy exile 
under an ambitious program labeled neither capitalist nor 
communist velascos regime radicalized peruvian politics 
imposed widespread state economic controls and began lasting social 
reform 
in a military legacy velasco steered peru away from the united 
states and toward the soviet union peru remains latin americas 
leading purchaser of soviet arms outside of central america 
according to the us government 
leftist political parties which had operated on the fringe of 
national politics emerged during the velasco era to become a 
dominant force 
his efforts to revolutionize perus deeply entrenched class 
structure while cutting dependence on the united states won 
widespread acclaim throughout the third world 
velasco was a person who wanted to make reform in behalf of 
the poor he had a genuine commitment to that said felipe ortiz 
de zevallos head of the respected economics analysis firm apoyo 
but ortiz de zevallos and other peruvian analysts say velascos 
well intentioned efforts to set peru on a more socially just course 
failed due to nearsightedness and contradictory and authoritarian 
policies 
the military strongman himself was deposed in another bloodless 
military coup amid increasing economic woes in 1975 he died two 
years later after a lengthy illness 
the succeeding military government of gen francisco morales 
bermudez toned down the strident nationalist rhetoric that 
frightened the middle and upper classes and alienated foreign 
businessmen and investors 
it also began dismantling some of velascos reforms while 
preparing the way for restoration of democracy belaunde was 
reelected president in 1980 
analysts say the current policies of president alan garcia 
elected to a fiveyearterm in 1985 reflect the authoritarian 
approach at reforming perus conservative structure 
garcias nationalization of perus private banks a year ago in 
the mold of velasco met great opposition and aggravated perus 
mounting economic woes analysts said 
analysts said a major reason for the 1968 coup was the belief 
that stability provided by a military government was needed to 
foment modernization and avoid growth of insurgency movements 
the military was absolutely convinced that the country had to 
be changed in a scheme of social justice said federico velarde 
director of the social studies institute desco 
despite velascos efforts one of the worlds most mysterious 
and bloody leftist guerrilla groups the shining path took up arms 
in 1980 in a growing insurgency that has claimed 12000 lives 
velascos first moves were a series of widespread 
nationalizations which started with the takeover of the exxon 
subsidiary international petroleum company 
as the states economic role grew the government imposed 
production and distribution reform and allowed worker participation 
in businesses 
perus communistdominated unions have since become one of the 
nations most powerful political and economic forces in peru 
velasco then wrenched from perus aristocracy the rich sugar and 
cotton plantations of the coast and the massive cattle and farming 
haciendas in the highlands aiming an agrarian reform at returning 
land to the indian peasants who worked it for centuries as virtual 
serfs 
ortiz de zevallos said many of the velascos programs resulted 
in a morass of inefficiency because they were poorly planned and 
executed 
the quantity and quality of industrial and agricultural output 
declined between 1968 and 1975 he said 
ortiz de zevallos said peru under velasco began a process of 
indebtedness to foreign lenders which led to a false sense of 
wellbeing that still exists 
the situation produced exactly the opposite of what the 
military government had proposed said julio colter director of 
the institute of peruvian studies a sociological research 
organization 
a new round of social inequalities followed that manifested 
themselves in intensified class struggle and a generalized 
opposition to the government he said

george bush commands an early autumn advantage 
over michael dukakis in the electoral college but the campaign for 
the white house will be decided in a series of close hard fought 
contests from california to connecticut according to an associated 
press survey of the 50 states 
republicans sound confident following a strong late summer 
surge by bush democrats project concern but say theres ample time 
to overtake the vice president 
dukakis won the primary on his massachusetts miracle claim 
but now people are remembering what government the economy was 
under jimmy carter said tony feather executive director of the 
republican party in missouri where the two candidates are rated 
even 
said democratic rep charles stenholm of texas where dukakis is 
the underdog its not over yet by any stretch of the 
imagination but hes got to go on the offensive against bushs 
charges of liberalism 
the nationwide public opinion surveys indicate a narrow 
advantage for bush although the same surveys show enough undecided 
and loosely committed voters to alter the outcome of the race at 
the last moment 
adding to the uncertainty is a campaign calendar that includes a 
debate wednesday between vice presidential candidates dan quayle 
and lloyd bentsen followed by a return engagement between dukakis 
and bush in midoctober after that comes a threeweek sprint to 
the finish line punctuated by a barrage of television commercials 
despite steady late summer advances by bush and democratic 
talk of a dukakis rebound neither man has been able to seize an 
advantage in a string of states where the election will be decided 
the list includes michigan ohio illinois missouri new jersey 
connecticut california and more totalling over 150 electoral 
votes 
it takes 270 electoral votes to win the white house and the 
only democrat to make it in the last five elections was a 
southerner jimmy carter 
bush appears to be solidifying much of the traditional 
republican base across the south and rocky mountain west the 
survey showed he is rated the solid leader in florida with its 21 
electoral votes and seems to be opening a little daylight between 
himself and the democrats in texas although dukakis is waging an 
intensive campaign in running mate lloyd bentsens home state 
border states such as oklahoma arkansas kentucky and tennessee 
remain competitive 
dukakis is given the edge in several traditional democratic 
party strongholds including new york with its 36 electoral votes 
but has not been as successful as bush in cementing his own 
political base 
the ap survey of political leaders independent analysts and 
public opinion polls in all 50 states turned up frequent 
expressions of concern among democrats over the shape of dukakis 
campaign tempered with hope that the massachusetts governor may be 
on the rebound after suffering a political free fall earlier in the 
campaign 
i think we have turned around what i perceived was a slide 
here said ohios democratic chairman jim ruvolo 
in maryland a traditional democratic state where the polls show 
a close race the partys vice chairman john willis said i 
would like to be further ahead i would like to be 20 points ahead 
but thats unrealistic 
republicans who were worried when bush was down in the polls 
last summer are smiling at their fortunes now that he is showing 
surprising strength in states like new york pennsylvania and iowa 
that figured to be among his weakest 
it looks like a dead heat in states like new york and 
massachusetts and a really strong democratic candidate should be 
considerably ahead in states like those at this point said 
robert s poliner chairman of the republican party in connecticut 
dukakis remains a solid favorite in both massachusetts and new 
york the ap survey showed 
senior campaign aides to both men offer different perspectives 
bushs campaign manager lee atwater said bushs electoral 
college base of 210 to 220 votes is intact freeing the vice 
president to campaign intensively in swing states with occasional 
forays into democratic strongholds 
dukakis aides say the race will be won or lost in the large 
number of battleground states where neither candidate has the edge 
the race has tightened up and its competitive and a lot of 
people havent made up their minds said dukakis communications 
director leslie dach the states that we need to win this race 
are very competitive 
the electoral college lineup looks like this 
bushs strongest region is probably the south where he leads 
almost everywhere bentsens presence on the ticket almost 
guarantees a close race in texas however and dukakis has strong 
support in north carolina and border states such as arkansas 
kentucky and tennessee 
california and washington on the west coast are rated as 
tossups with dukakis given the edge in oregon bush appears to 
have firmed up support in traditional republican states such as 
utah idaho and wyoming but the dukakis campaign says it has 
strength in new mexico and montana 
farm states such as kansas and nebraska are leaning to bush 
while dukakis harbors hope for the dakotas dukakis is favored in 
iowa wisconsin and minnesota in the upper midwest dukakis has no 
hopes for quayles home state of indiana the democrat seems to 
have a slight edge in illinois but democrats concede he is 
probably slightly behind in ohio and missouri republicans see a 
narrow advantage in michigan 
the northeast is dukakis strongest region and despite 
closerthanexpected public polls he is regarded as the likely 
winner at home in massachusetts as well as new york rhode island 
maryland and west virginia vermont and maine appear to be close 
and new hampshire is bush territory

birdhouses outnumber homes in this tiny 
community which bills itself the bluebird capital of the world and 
goes out of its way to make sure the shy birds keep coming back 
this town of 150 in the windswept horse heaven hills first gave 
bluebirds an incentive to stay more than two decades ago and they 
have returned again and again to raise their young and provide a 
little extra income for a depressed economy 
its a real community pride said lynn mains coowner of a 
restaurant and one of many who help maintain the birdhouses 
the bickleton bluebirds are now gathering in flocks for their 
midoctober migration to mexico or southern california the males 
begin returning in february often to the same house and are 
followed by the females 
although the altitude and climate of this wheat country are 
ideal for bluebirds their population was declining two decades 
ago ms mains said the birds are cavity dwellers and there were 
not enough dead trees or rotted fence posts for them to build nests 
in 
jess brinkerhoff of nearby richland realized the problem while 
camping in the area with his wife elva in 1965 they nailed up a 
rusty onegallon can and that became the first of about 1500 
birdhouses that fill the town and dot the surrounding countryside 
at first the brinkerhoffs were the lone caretakers for the 
birds building cleaning and maintaining the houses my wife 
passed away four years ago and then the people of bickleton took 
over said brinkerhoff 78 
because arthritis and advancing age have slowed brinkerhoff 
down the chief birdhouse maker now is bill shotwell whos built 
about 400 
i usually saw out the pieces for 100 birdhouses and drill the 
holes and im supposed to be retired shotwell said 
unlike the many swallows that swarm to san juan capistrano in 
southern california on the same day every year just a few thousand 
bluebirds trickle into bickleton 
but that was enough to lead the north american bluebird society 
to proclaim bickleton the bluebird capital of the world in 1983 
the brinkerhoffs also were recognized 
its not easy to keep bluebirds in the neighborhood old nests 
must be completely cleaned out each winter and the houses need 
periodic maintenance 
the houses are white and the roofs blue approximating the color 
of the male birds plumage the females are attracted to it 
ms mains explained 
the little town hasnt profited much from its bluebirds mostly 
because it is so far off the beaten path bickleton is 50 miles 
south of yakima on a narrow winding twolane road that climbs 
steeply up to the town 
but a few hundred visitors are drawn each year by celebrations 
such as the annual bluebird run and the bluebird country christmas 
merchants sell glass bluebirds tshirts and caps as well as 
the plywood houses made by shotwell with profits going toward the 
building of more houses 
in addition each year we have a contest to see who can spot 
the first one ms mains said you win a good pat on the back 
and a cup of coffee

a policewoman full of life and laughter and a 
jobless vietnam veteran haunted by the horrors of war lived worlds 
apart but their worlds collided when they died side by side in a 
bloody rampage 
clem henderson shot irma ruiz in the heart in the doorway of the 
montefiore school on the west side minutes later henderson fell 
fatally wounded just a few feet away shot by mrs ruizs partner 
two other people also died 
mrs ruizs partner detective gregory jaglowski remembered her 
as a great woman best friend she was the greatest partner you 
could ever have 
irma made us laugh officer dorothy griffin said in her 
eulogy at mrs ruiz funeral one week ago she loved jewelry and 
diamonds and like a diamond she sparkled her sense of humor 
her quick wit were matched only by her love of family 
both henderson and mrs ruiz were 40 when they died sept 22 he 
was the father of three sons she had three sons and a daughter 
henderson harbored a passion for the plight of vietnam gis 
said david finke a friend who works for the midwest committee for 
military counseling a private nonprofit group henderson was 
involved with he felt that nobody wanted to listen that society 
had turned its back 
so he helped other vets working with the national black draft 
counselors and dreaming of creating his own veterans center hed 
even picked out a building that he talked of buying finke said 
but the day he died henderson stalked his neighborhood armed 
with a 38caliber revolver and vowed to kill everybody i see 
hendersons demons likely took him back to vietnam friends say 
psychiatrists call it posttraumatic stress syndrome 
my sense is that once he started shooting he was just back on 
patrol again he was in the jungle under this detached sense where 
you simply turn off your emotions said finke 
how do we expect them to unlearn those reflexes just because 
they are discharged finke asked youve got a time bomb 
situation with embittered people who are feeling abandoned 
to know the real clem henderson you have to know his prewar 
life said alonzo jackson brother of hendersons exwife emma 
before the war he was open always happy and energetic 
after the war he was different he mostly kept to himself 
jackson said at hendersons burial friday 
he was a victim of the vietnam war plain and simple 
police records show henderson was arrested 12 times mostly for 
battery and disorderly conduct and spent more than six years in 
jail between 1973 and 1984 
he found work at a beauty school but a 1985 gunshot wound to 
the head caused seizures that forced him to stop friends and 
acquaintances say police records show the wound was 
selfinflicted hendersons brother roger says he was shot by an 
attacker 
henderson alternated between living with his mother and his 
second wife daisy finke said but he also talked of sleeping on 
park benches finke said 
mrs ruiz knew the risks of police work but rarely talked about 
the dangers said brotherinlaw paul fedrick 
by all accounts family and police work were her dreams come 
true 
she has approximately 25 nieces and nephews and she made sure 
that every christmas every kid had something under the tree 
said fedrick 29 she was like the matriarch to the family 
she graduated at the top of her class from the police academy in 
1976 becoming one of the first hispanic women on the force and 
won departmental honors since then 
but her children and family came first 
what stands out in my mind is that whenever we needed a parent 
to come in for any reason she would be there said sister 
campion maquire principal of christ the king school which the two 
youngest ruiz children attend 
we were proud to have her in our community said neighbor 
and close friend rose coleman i only wish that everybody had a 
chance to know her

here is a transcript of the news 
conference conducted in orbit sunday by the five discovery 
astronauts frederick h hauck richard o covey george d pinky 
nelson john m mike lounge and david c hilmers questions were 
read by reporters at the johnson space center 
q commander hauck you said before the flight that you expected 
to see some surprises can you tell us what surprises youve seen 
on this flight 
hauck well i guess the first surprise was right at liftoff we 
had a caution and warning sound actually an alert tone that got 
our attention real quick and gave us a few moments to concern 
ourselves about it we also had a problem with one of our flash 
evaporators those were technical problems i guess i was very 
pleased that i wasnt surprised and how much i enjoyed it up here 
weve really enjoyed being up here in this tremendous machine and 
seeing the beautiful sights weve seen 
q gentlemen you are all veterans of spaceflight youve all 
been there before but its been more than 2 years for all of you 
is there any difference in being back in space what have you 
observed does it feel different or does it feel the same 
hilmers i think its surprising how little has changed i think 
all of us readapted to space very quickly and the communications 
with mission control seemed like it really hadnt been 2 years i 
think everyone was adept at all the jobs that we had to do and i 
think we got back in business very well 
q gentlemen your wives said the other day that watching the 
launch they were filled with excitement but also fear that it was 
wonderful and awful at the same time im interested in your 
feelings as you took off 
covey i think i can speak for the crew and say it was really 
wonderful when we lifted off it certainly was more 
anxietyproducing than we had anticipated at least i had 
throughout the entire ascent i had forgotten what it was like to 
accelerate at 3 gs for a sustained period of time and how helpless 
you really feel during that time period 
q for dave hilmers youve flown before but after this flight 
is over what special moment do you want to tell your family about 
hilmers well i think there are going to be an awful lot of 
moments that im going to tell my family about so many things that 
weve showed up here i think some of the earth views that weve 
seen and some of the nighttime scenes of the stars those are just 
so undescribable i wish that i could take the view that i actually 
see rather than just pictures back to them but ill try my best to 
describe them 
q you guys didnt appear very busy up there at times was your 
flight plan too conservative and would your time have been better 
spent with a busier flight plan 
lounge well i think we stayed pretty busy here on the middeck 
weve done about 12 different scientific experiments of one sort or 
another and the days have seemed very full in the future we hope 
to get back into the business of putting on spacesuits and building 
space stations and repairing satellites but theres a lot of good 
science that you can do right here in this facility you see us in 
right now 
q to follow on your opening and daves comments there a moment 
ago can you tell us specifically about some of the more 
spectacular sights youve seen around the world and lets go to 
pinky 
nelson well i guess ill divide it into three different parts 
in the daytime weve had some spectacular passes across africa 
transmission interrupted briefly great shots of the ground 
at night the indescribable views coming over south america huge 
fires in the forests and big cities down there and the sky at 
night is a completely different view we spent some time just 
looking with our eyes and some time looking with our 
lowlightlevel camera that have given us some views i always 
enjoy seeing the southern hemisphere and have been dragging people 
to the window showing them the magellanic clouds and the southern 
cross

q i have a question for rick and dick can you give us some 
idea of your flight plan for tomorrow your landing patterns and 
what landmarks youll be looking for as you come in 
hauck well be coming in just about between los angeles and 
santa barbara overhead the coast at about 110000 feet and 
circling around and we hope if the weather permits and the winds 
permit to land on edwards runway 17 well pass overhead the field 
at about 40000 feet becoming subsonic you all can hear as were 
supersonic a double sonic boom when you hear that youll know 
were about five minutes from landing and then well make a 
standard approach 300 miles per hour coming down to a touchdown 
at 200 miles per hour on that lakebed 
q for mike lounge there are two men now running for president 
what would you say to them from the shuttle to convince them to 
fully support the space program and its longterm future even if it 
means putting up budget increases for nasa in a time of 
considerable deficits 
lounge thats a tough one i think we have to take the long 
view this is a very important flight simply because its the first 
step i would hope that all of the enthusiasm that weve seen 
throughout the country for this flight is sustained for the dozens 
and dozens of flights we have ahead of us if were going to make 
this program grow to the point that it needs to grow to get us on 
the path to the future 
q gentlemen the challenger crew set out to teach some very 
important lessons to the children of the world i would like to 
know what lessons you would hope would be taken from your flight 
and the effort it took to get to where you are today 
covey john ive got a couple of young daughters and i know 
what i would like them to learn from what ive done is that there 
is always a reward for hard work both individually and as a group 
much like the effort that was put forth by nasa and the contractors 
to get the space shuttle flying again and that there are new 
adventures everywhere and space is one of them and hopefully that 
all of the young children out there who want to come to space 
someday will at least have the opportunity to try 
q for commander hauck admiral truly told us yesterday that 
nasa really threaded the needle on your launch with the extra 
emphasis on safety and a lot of flexibility apparently in the 
launch schedule do you think the launch came a little too close to 
violating the safety criteria 
hauck oh as i understand your question do we think the launch 
came too close to violating safety criteria not from my 
perspective that is we were very comfortable with the liftoff as 
it was executed we thought the launch team as a matter of fact 
after main engine cutoff we were complimentary within ourselves to 
the launch team and the way they handled a few minor annoyances 
down close to the launch the question of our cabin pressure and so 
forth from our perspective we couldnt have been happier with the 
way that launch went off and the countdown too 
q i have a question for pinky nelson as a trained research 
scientist can you tell us how well the several experiments that 
you have managed could have been executed by automated equipment 
with no people on board 
nelson well to be honest with you a number of these could have 
been run automated the advantage of running them in the mode that 
we have interrupted by signal drop let me add one thing and 
that is all of the experiments that we brought on board this time 
have exceeded my expectations in the way they have run 
q do you feel you have fulfilled all the objectives of the 
mission and what if any recommendations do you have for changes 
in the orbiter 
hauck the machine worked superbly im not sure that weve had 
a mission that has been this troublefree with an orbiter before 
have to talk with the folks on the ground i guess we have flown 
with our launch and entry suits for the first time since the first 
four missions we do find those to be a bit of an encumbrance 
well need to talk very seriously about whether theres a bit of a 
ill call it a bit of compromise that we would like to make its 
certainly a trade between the advantage that the suit gives us 
should we have a problem and the fact that it doesnt allow us 
quite the flexibility that we had before i guess thats the major 
one and i cant think of any others 
q whats the hispanic contribution to the space program so far 
hauck could you repeat the question please 
q the question is what is the hispanic contribution to 
spaceflight before 
hauck well id say theres no doubt about it that weve 
hundreds of thousands of people out throughout the united states 
that have worked on the space program and i think that every race 
every minority group is represented they may not be represented to 
the degree that that group might like but i know that in our 
travels throughout the country to the various centers and the 
contractors we have spoken with a number of hispanics and many of 
which we have worked closely with at the johnson space center and i 
think its really a contribution of the american people that were 
really very proud of 
q weve heard a lot in the last few days about the cabin 
getting warm can you tell us how comfortable are you and the rest 
of the crew as far as cabin temperature and what kinds of things 
are your doing to keep cool 
lounge it was a little warmer than it is now in the first 
couple of days of the flight because of the flash evaporator 
problem today we feel weve got that working pretty well weve 
been boiling water all day long to cool the vehicle and i put on a 
longsleeve shirt and weve all got long pants on for the first 
time its not been bad at all really 
q pinky good wishes from everyone in minnesota especially our 
home town in willmar before you left you said you were going to 
monitor your own physical and mental responses to the liftoff phase 
of the mission because you had not specific tasks what did you 
learn 
nelson were going to have a good tolerance for heat i guess 
its pretty warm in the suit this is where i launched there where 
dick covey is sitting i didnt have much of a view so i paid a lot 
of attention to my body its difficult to breathe during the 3 g 
part of the flight mainly because of the weight of the suit and 
the harness you can feel a little bit of the inside of your body 
shifting around with the weight and then shifting back again as the 
engines cut off ive got some more on my tape some place ill 
have to tell you about it later

after a flurry of rallies arrests and 
speeches in the streets campaigning was put on hold today while 
chileans prepared for a vote on extending rightwing gen augusto 
pinochets presidency to 1997 
police and some army troops were out in force 
by law political campaigning ended on midnight sunday after a 
massive propinochet caravan of cars trucks and buses jammed the 
capitals main boulevards and groups of opposition sympathizers 
skirmished with riot police 
dozens were arrested in the skirmishes according to preliminary 
police reports helmeted riot officers used tear gas water cannons 
and nightsticks to disperse groups of pinochet opponents on the 
downtown streets 
at least ten people were hurt two seriously in isolated 
incidents throughout the day including brawls between government 
supporters and opponents 
hundreds of policemen patrolled the streets and were joined 
sunday by small army units most of them manning machine guns 
mounted on pickup trucks and other vehicles 
the government has insisted that it will keep strict order 
before and during wednesdays referendum in which the government 
is asking chileans to ratify a proposal by pinochet and other 
military commanders that he remain in power until 1997 the armed 
forces has traditionally been charged with guarding elections in 
chile where the last presidential ballot was in 1970 
if a majority of the 74 million registered voters cast yes 
ballots pinochet will begin a new eightyear term in march if 
most vote no an open presidential election will be held in 
december 1989 and pinochet will hand power over to the winner in 
march 1990 
in either case elections for a congress are planned in a year 
the legislature was disbanded when pinochet commander of the 
powerful army seized power in a bloody 1973 coup that toppled the 
3yearold elected government of president salvador allende a 
marxist 
however the legislature will be virtually powerless to amend a 
1980 constitution crafted by pinochets administration that gives 
the military autonomy and a strong supervisory role in national 
affairs 
in sundays progovernment demonstration tens of thousands of 
hornhonking flagfestooned cars trucks and buses filled the 
citys main boulevard and several other major thoroughfares 
lines of vehicles stretched for miles from the citys center 
especially on major roads to the affluent eastern suburbs huge 
traffic jams were spawned as they attempted to converge shortly 
after noon on the government palace in downtown santiago the 
capital city that is home to more than 4 million of the countrys 
12 million people 
viva pinochet shouted participants many of them young 
people they filled private cars flatbed trucks and buses 
decorated with red white and blue national flags and posters 
showing a smiling pinochet in civilian dress 
loudspeakers atop many of the vehicles urged people to vote 
yes in the referendum while drivers leaned constantly on their 
horns 
it was by far the biggest demonstration of voter support for 
pinochet 72 who lags behind the opposition in most opinion polls 
a 16party opposition coalition staged its final campaign event on 
saturday drawing a crowd of hundreds of thousands of middle and 
workingclass chileans to an openair rally 
it was difficult to estimate attendance at sundays 
demonstration as participants in the caravan snaked through the 
streets governmentowned radio nacional of santiago said 30000 
vehicles took part a progovernment campaign spokesman claimed 
that 700000 people participated but the figure appeared to be an 
exaggeration 
as the caravan broke up groups of government opponents entered 
the downtown on foot and in cars chanting hes going to fall 
police sent them fleeing with tear gas and water cannons but they 
regrouped again and again whistling in derision at the passing 
cars of pinochet backers 
pinochet recently has been easing political restrictions and 
cultivating a conciliatory image that contrasts with his harshly 
authoritarian reputation 
he decreed an end to states of emergency in effect since he took 
power and lifted a ban on the return of all leftists in exile many 
of them were expelled or fled during a wave of fierce repression 
that followed the coup

q we thought they were going to keep you on the ground at the 
cape because of highlevel winds that were blowing in wrong 
direction during your ascent could you tell that at all did it 
have any effect whatsoever on the vehicle when you reached 30000 
to 40000 foot 
hauck no those are forces that are masked and would be masked 
by the vibrations that we feel just from the resonance and acoustic 
vibrations from the solid rocket motors we would not have expected 
to feel them and we did not 
q to mike lounge in the opening comments you talked about the 
challenger dream being alive in your hearts since it appears 
youve had a little extra time on this mission after the satellite 
deployment on thursday i was wondering if you might be able to 
share with us some of the hearttoheart talks that you all have 
had among yourselves during the flight 
lounge ah no probably not those arent the kinds of things 
you share weve done a lot of thinking about our friends that we 
lost 2 years ago and ive done a lot of contemplating on that 
personally as im drifting off to sleep at nights and its good to 
be back where they wanted to go so badly 
q for rick or for pinky when it comes to safety and rescue do 
you think the united states should go together with russia and 
europe and canada and other countries and if there should be some 
standards 
nelson if the question is how are we going to handle 
international cooperation within our own program i think you do 
that through planning ahead of time through standards that you set 
and through the procedures that you use so that by the time you get 
around to flying with an international group or international 
crew youre all working with the same procedures you all have the 
same knowledge and capabilities of carrying those out so that 
theres really going to be no difference among the crew whether 
its all american or has internationals on board 
q could you appraise the mission management team process before 
liftoff and whether you can tell your colleagues who will follow 
you if it works well 
hauck well this gives me an opportunity to thank my good 
friend captain bob crippen for the outstanding job that he did from 
our perspective in pulling that all together and this didnt all 
just happen of course in the last few days before the launch it 
was a manymonth effort and i thought that management team of all 
that i saw in close at the frrs for the main engine firings and 
frrs for the orbiter itself i was just very happy and i think 
that bodes very well for the way we do business 
q youve been taking photos of phenomena on earth such as 
volcanoes in africa and hurricane damage in mexico what have you 
observed there that might be of value to those areas 
hilmers well i think some of the biggest things that weve 
seen are things like deforestations weve seen erosion weve seen 
some land usage that kind of disturbs us and i think the good 
lesson is that we take back these photos to men on earth in their 
respective countries to make sure that they take care of what 
nature has given them and to make sure it is used wisely our 
environment is a very fragile thing and i think thats something 
that were very impressed by when we take photos and as we look out 
the window 
q have you caught yourself being so excited at times or other 
crew members around you that youve had to subdue yourself 
hauck yes yes we do as a matter of fact its good that were 
i think if we were a crew of one the possibility of getting 
distracted by the beautiful sights and the fun of being up here 
could perhaps cause you to not pay enough attention to what youre 
doing the crew concept is a wonderful thing and it keeps us on our 
toes 
q on liftoff day there was an agreement signed in washington 
between europe japan canada and united states about freedom the 
space station do you have any comment on that 
hauck i think thats great that just means we can pull 
together even more time working on the same problems and the same 
solutions and if theres a team up here that can get a lot more 
done than five people individually theres no question that the 
unique cultures that each of the international partners bring to 
this effort will be synergistic and make the whole bigger than the 
sum of the parts 
q what do you think now pinky about the future of the space 
shuttle as a platform for scientific platform 
nelson i think the future is bright for a scientific use for 
the space shuttle as i mentioned before the middeck that were in 
is really a national resource many scientists will be glad to have 
a room this size with zero gravity inside it that has electricity 
and water available for them to do their experiments in i think it 
will be used extensively in the future probably primarily as a 
development lab as a test bed for experiments such as the ones 
weve got on board where prototypes can be tested and where new 
concepts can be proven that can then later be developed and 
expanded and put into freeflying satellites or put on board the 
space station in production facilities 
q as you get ready for landing do the problems with the flash 
evaporator system and one of the oms rockets concern you if no why 
not 
hauck well of course theyre something that concerns you if 
you have the next failure our understanding right now is that the 
flash evaporator though we expect it to work almost fully up to 
its potential and we could sustain another failure and still be in 
good shape thats also the case with the orbital maneuvering 
engines its true that we do have one thrust vector control system 
down on the last engine but we have a backup and we also have the 
capability of locking that control system in its current position 
and still deorbit plus we could shut down one engine and come 
back on the other engine and if that would fail we could come back 
on the reaction control system so we have quite a backup 
capability there

a ticket to a michael dukakis rally 
is easier to come by than one for a boston red sox home game or a 
performance of les miserables and a lot cheaper too 
what makes a dukakis ticket unusual is that people need one at 
all 
in fact they do if they want to be right down front within 
cheering distance of the democratic presidential candidate 
or in this campaign it might be more appropriate to say within 
heckling distance of the candidate 
immediately after labor day dukakis began encountering intense 
heckling particularly from antiabortion activists 
he had to fight to be heard during an appearance in early 
september in niles ill 
the campaign decided something had to be done their response 
was to rope off the area closest to the podium and require tickets 
for admission 
even students at rutgers university needed tickets to get close 
to dukakis when he delivered a speech on the environment 
in that case a ticket got a little star quality because actor 
robert redford introduced the candidate 
tickets also were required for rallies in melrose park ill 
jersey city nj and greensburg pa 
the tickets were free obtained from elected and party officials 
or from unions 
so at each rally the people down front were reliably 
enthusiastic for the candidate and cheered at every jibe against 
republican george bush their response usually drowning out the 
chants of bush supporters relegated to the fringes of the crowd 
another tool used to control hecklers is loud speakers the huge 
kind usually found at events like rock concerts 
a bank of megadecibel speakers placed at the rear of the crowd 
assures that the candidates voice will be heard above the chants 
of any hecklers 
at rutgers someone neglected to provide quite enough speakers 
and dukakis had to contend with a large group of probush students 
who chanted borrrring borrrring and recited the pledge of 
allegiance to the flag 
but they didnt have tickets so they were too far from the 
podium to effectively disrupt his speech 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
during a campaign stop in idalou texas reporters traveling 
with dukakis were delighted to receive colorful bandanas some red 
some blue 
several reporters were wearing them when they got off the plane 
with dukakis in ontario calif the entourage went off to tour the 
stringfellow toxic waste dump 
the next stop was a nearby high school and a secret service 
agent asked the reporters to take off their bandanas 
he said local gangs the crips and bloods wear colored 
bandanas to identify themselves the agent said local police were 
concerned that seeing reporters wearing the scarves would encourage 
the practice among students 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for two weeks dukakis kept his distance from reporters a 
tactic reflecting concern that responses to questions often were 
overshadowing the messages in his speeches 
when he held a news conference in dallas a reporter asked if 
the reduced access to the candidate was a shift in attitude 
the candidate smiled shrugged and pointed out that he was 
answering questions at that very moment 
take advantage of the opportunity he said you never know 
when it will happen again 
when the news conference ended and he was leaving the room a 
reporter shouted see you next month governor

for the united nations last week was a 
week of champagne and euphoria even the un fountain dry for 
three years of financial drought was splashing again in the autumn 
air a sign of happy times 
there was the nobel peace prize for un peacekeeping and the 
farewell speech of president reagan who finally praised the world 
body 
reagan and other speakers hailed peace agreements talks or 
prospects of peace in afghanistan the iraniraq war southern 
africa and namibia cambodia and the western sahara conflicts in 
which the united nations has played or will play a major role 
resolving 
so popular is the united nations that britain and iran chose it 
as the forum to announce the resumption of full diplomatic 
relations 
china and the soviet union chose it to announce the first 
working visit of a chinese foreign minister to moscow since the 
1950s a major step toward a sinosoviet summit 
at the united nations chinese and soviet foreign ministers also 
discussed cambodia signaling a new impetus by the communist rivals 
to solve the problem of vietnamese occupation 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and democratic 
presidential candidate michael dukakis chose the general assembly 
and the nearby waldorf astoria to meet 
even the fountain in the un plaza turned off in a fiscal 
austerity drive was turned on in a sign that the united nations 
has received both a little more money from the united states and 
other indebted nations and a lot more respect 
the high point of the week was thursday when the nobel peace 
prize was awarded to un peacekeeping operations worldwide for 40 
years the nobel prize committee cited recent un achievements in 
mediating an afghan agreement and in arranging a ceasefire in the 
iraniraq war 
while celebrating the nobel peace prize with champagne un 
officials warned the united nations still has a beer pocketbook 
because the organization owes nearly 600 million 
the threeweek general debate a parade of world leaders began 
monday when president reagan addressed the general assembly of 159 
nations and in a dramatic turnabout conceded the organization he 
criticized for seven years was doing a good job 
yes the united nations is a better place today reagan 
said but so too is the world 
reagans administration had debunked the organization for 
antiwestern bias ineffectiveness and wasteful bureaucracy 
other speakers lauded the united nations 
they also covered the full range of standard problems from 
apartheid to third world debt but the tone was far less contentious 
than in previous years reflecting the improvement in eastwest 
relations 
there was special emphasis on strengthening the existing ban on 
chemical weapons and reagan called for an international conference 
in paris on the outlawed weapons president francois mitterand of 
france urged embargos of chemical weapons materials to offending 
states 
the environment was a major topic and for the first time 
shevardnadze devoted a major portion of his general assembly speech 
to the ozone layer the biosphere acid rain dying seas and dying 
fauna 
for the soviets it was a major shift in focus a joining of the 
international ecological movement as it seeks to extricate itself 
from regional conflicts and improve relations with washington and 
beijing 
but there were problems and embarrassments too signs of 
limitations of the world organization 
just hours after champagne flowed to celebrate the nobel peace 
prize announcement the soviet union said the uns tiny 50man 
observer force in afghanistan and pakistan was not doing a good 
job 
shevardnadze told the permanent members of the security council 
that the un team has failed to investigate flagrant violations of 
the afghanistan agreements by pakistan for allegedly training and 
arming afghan rebels 
and while a unsupervised ceasefire was holding on the 
iraniraq war front talks toward a permanent peace have dragged 
into their second month 
both sides have been intransigient after iraq introduced the 
issue of sovereignty over the disputed shatt alarab waterway and 
insisted on early un dredging before proceeding with talks on 
other issues

johannesburg south africa opponents of apartheid denounced 
president pw bothas courtship of black africa as sheer 
hypocrisy after he returned from zaire his third summit with a 
black african leader in as many weeks 
an official of the outlawed african national congress fighting 
south africas whiteminority government on sunday condemned 
president mobutu sese seko of zaire for meeting botha over the 
weekend 
botha said the increasingly open contacts between south africa 
and its black neighbors discredited the sanctions campaign waged 
against south africa by western countries opposed to apartheid 
south africas system of racial segregation 
in his recent visits to mozambique malawi and zaire botha has 
not been met by demands from black leaders for political changes 
their public criticisms of apartheid have also been mild or 
nonexistent 
one of bothas chief foreign policy goals has been to expand 
ties with black africa without having to promise concessions to the 
disenfranchised black majority in his own country 
however mobutu made it clear that he pressed the issue of 
jailed anc leader nelson mandela during the private talks with 
botha on saturday 
south africas foreign minister pik botha would neither 
confirm nor deny reports that president botha promised the 
unconditional release of mandela during the zaire meeting 
zaire radio in kinshasa on sunday called the meeting a 
diplomatic triumph furthering mobutus efforts to bring peace to 
southern africa where a civil war is going on in marxistled 
angola and guerrillas are fighting south african rule of southwest 
africa 
but stanley mabizela the ancs chief representative in 
zimbabwe said african leaders should shun botha because he 
executes people who are victims of an inhuman society as well as 
political prisoners 
south africas largestselling black newspaper city press 
described the visit to zaire as sheer hypocrisy 
what is the point of achieving peace and stability with 
neighbors when your own country is engulfed in flames the paper 
asked in an editorial sunday 
apartheid must be abolished and negotiations held with 
legitimate black leaders city press said until these minimum 
demands are met mr botha can tour the rest of africa as much as 
he likes peace will not come to this country 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services 
the summit also drew criticism in zaire where police fired on a 
crowd of about 200 university students protesting bothas visit 
professors on sunday said two of the protesters were wounded 
but botha said he planned more trips in africa soon 
last month botha traveled to mozambique and invited its 
president joaquim chissano to visit south africa both chissano 
and mobutu accepted the invitations although no dates for their 
visits were set 
no black african leader has made a state visit to south africa 
since botha took power in 1978 
mobutu was quoted sunday by the washington post as saying he won 
a firm commitment from botha that mandela 70 will be freed 
soon after he recovers from tuberculosis and be allowed to return 
to home 
botha has offered previously to release mandela in exchange for 
mandelas renunciation of violence mandela recuperating from 
tuberculosis in cape town has refused to repudiate the violent 
tactics of the anc which he led until he was jailed 26 years ago

sens lloyd bentsen of texas and dan quayle of 
indiana have voted together for the reagan tax cuts military aid 
to the contras money for the mx missile and the death penalty for 
drugrelated murders 
on such issues as defense and capital punishment in fact 
bentsens voting record is at odds not with quayle but with his 
own running mate michael dukakis quayle on the other hand has 
little apparent quarrel with any of george bushs positions 
still the two vice presidential candidates have often found 
themselves at loggerheads including a recent battle over whether 
to give workers 60 days notice of plant closings 
as they gird for their nationally televised debate in omaha 
neb wednesday night each will be probing the others record for 
points of attack 
for the younger less experienced republican whose credentials 
the democrats have ridiculed the debate may also be an opportunity 
to emphasize those issues where he bush and bentsen are of one 
mind and dukakis is of another 
but there will also be ample opportunity for bentsen to point 
out stark differences between his and quayles voting records on 
social programs labor issues civil rights education energy and 
other matters 
bentsen 67 has served nearly 24 years in congress twice as 
long as his 41yearold rival and the texan is near the pinnacle 
of the senate power structure as chairman of the senate finance 
committee 
in this year alone bentsen has been the democrats point man in 
successful efforts to enact major legislation on trade 
catastrophic health insurance for the elderly and the nations 
welfare programs 
a defenseminded texas tory bentsen was pushing for tax cuts 
including a lower capital gains tax back in the late 1970s during 
the carter administration when he chaired the joint economic 
committee 
quayle is a backbench republican who sits on the armed 
services budget and labor and human services committees his main 
legislative accomplishment during eight years in the senate was the 
job training partnership act of 1983 
he made that legislative effort with support from a liberal 
democrat sen edward kennedy of massachusetts over the 
reservations of the reagan administration 
quayle has been a stalwart supporter of the strategic defense 
initiative but bentsen also supports it like bentsen quayle 
voted in 1986 to override reagans veto of a bill imposing 
sanctions against south africas apartheid regime 
on the campaign trail quayle almost never mentions bentsen 
while constantly pillorying dukakis as weak on defense and as 
merely another inexperienced liberal governor like jimmy 
carter the last democrat to occupy the white house 
but as a freshman member of the house in 1977 quayle supported 
carters plan to kill the b1 bomber in the pivotal vote quayle 
and seven other republicans sided with the democrats on a 202199 
showdown on the issue reagan revived the b1 when he took office 
and all 100 bombers now have been built 
quayle voted to sustain reagans veto this year of the civil 
rights restoration act bentsen voted for the successful override 
on the plant closing notification law quayle was the leading 
opponent and bentsen the leading proponent quayle argued it would 
impose a legislative straitjacket on industry and impede our 
capacity to compete in world markets 
bentsen and quayle debated the issue last april 22 on public 
televisions macneillehrer newshour reagan later vetoed the trade 
bill because it contained the 60day notice provision 
but bentsen and fellow democrats came back with separate trade 
and plant closing notification bills reagan eventually signed the 
trade bill and let the plant closing notification measure become 
law without his signature 
bentsen and quayle were on opposite sides of this years effort 
in congress to raise the 335anhour minimum wage for the first 
time since 1981 
quayle after initially resisting any increase supported a 
compromise including a subminimum training wage for teenagers 
quayle says he now supports a 4 minimum wage but says what the 
working poor really need is better training and education not a 
higher minimum wage 
there will be no increase in the minimum wage this year 
however faced with the threat of a republican filibuster and 
unwilling to accept a subminimum wage for teens senate democrats 
recently dropped efforts to raise the minimum to 455 
bentsen votes most of the time with the democratic majority but 
he has broken ranks to support reagan requests on contra aid sdi 
and the mx mobile missile 
quayle was an outspoken opponent of legislation to ban the use 
of lie detectors in the workplace and he complained when the white 
house dropped its opposition last march that it had caved like a 
house of cards bentsen supported the bill 
bentsen and quayle were on opposite sides of the senates may 9 
1985 vote for a oneyear budget freeze including social security 
that passed 5049 with bush casting the tiebreaker but while 
bentsen voted against a freeze on that occasion he voted twice in 
1984 and 1985 for other freeze proposals that would have delayed 
social security costofliving increases for six or 12 months 
on other issues

a serbian leader hailed by 
supporters as the second tito has moved closer to regaining 
serbian control over two provinces and is strengthening his hand 
inside the divided communist leadership 
slobodan milosevic was given a boost last week with the 
resignation of two political rivals and formal party backing for 
serbias demands to absorb vojvodina and kosovo provinces 
the moves have given milosevic ammunition that will be useful in 
a major political showdown expected at a central committee meeting 
oct 17 
on friday the communist partys presidium or politburo 
approved serbias drive to tighten control over the two provinces 
apparently bowing to the pressure exerted by hundreds of thousands 
of slavs at almost daily rallies 
late saturday the state news agency tanjug announced the 
resignation from the powerful 23man poliburo of bosko krunic who 
until july held the annually rotating leadership of yugoslavias 
ruling communist party 
krunics resignation followed the similarly sudden exit of franc 
setinc a communist leader from the liberal northern republic of 
slovenia last monday 
setinc resigned in a public letter attacking the insanity of 
emotional mass rallies by milosevic supporters who frequently have 
called for the ouster of krunic and other communist leaders 
ostensibly the rallies which drew at least another 100000 
slavs on to the streets this weekend are held to express support 
for the serbs and montenegrins in ethnically troubled kosovo where 
slavs allege daily harassment by the albanian majority 
the emotional crowds wave portraits of the 47yearold 
milosevic lauding the leader of serbias communist party for his 
drive to reimpose full serbian control over kosovo and vojvodina 
since the rallies started in july however they have become a 
vehicle for expression of popular discontent with the partys 
inability to end a protracted economic and social crisis 
the annually rotating collective leadership of the country and 
the party bequeathed by the late josip broz tito before he died in 
1980 has failed to come to grips with yugoslavias problems 
this weekend inflation officially hit 217 percent unemployment 
stands at 15 percent an austerity program adopted last may to 
repay the 21 billion foreign debt is to be modified next week 
with the government again trying to stave off worker unrest by 
giving way to demands for higher wages to cope with spiraling price 
hikes 
in this chaos milosevic has skilfully used the emotional issue 
of kosovo to unite many hundreds of thousands of serbs behind him 
and to appear to them as the strong political leader needed to rule 
as effectively as tito 
arguably yugoslavias most backward region kosovo was once the 
heart of serbias medieval empire to the mostly christian slavs 
it symbolizes serbias most glorious days 
but the province is now dominated by mostly moslem ethnic 
albanians who make up 90 percent of kosovos 2 million people and 
have the highest birthrate in europe 
the slavs resent how the albanians have used titos 1974 
constitution which granted broad powers to the autonomous 
provinces of kosovo and vojvodina 
serbs allege that the albanians seek even greater autonomy in 
the form of a fullfledged republic if this happens serbs argue 
the republic would instantly secede and unite with neighboring 
communist albania precipitating yugoslavias disintegration 
by taking up the cause of kosovos serbs milosevic can thus 
argue that he is acting not simply for the benefit of the slavs but 
to preserve the six republics that comprise yugoslavia 
in the republics of slovenia croatia and bosniaherzegovina 
party leaders are suspicious of milosevic and traditionally wary of 
serbia the largest of yugoslavias republics 
bosniaherzegovina posted police on its borders last month to 
stop potential promilosevic demonstrators from rallying there 
danas an influential croatian weekly wondered aloud in its 
latest issue who will say enough to protest rallies 
both the state presidency and the party presidium have urged 
yugoslavs not to attend the massive rallies 
but milosevic never asked his supporters to go home and his 
recalcitrance now seems to have paid off 
at fridays presidium meeting state president raif dizdarevic 
said the proposals for changes granting serbia greater control are 
an acceptable basis for discussion 
replied milosevic it is with great satisfaction that we heard 
encouragement today

republican vice presidential nominee dan 
quayle conceding he could make one of his celebrated gaffes at 
wednesdays debate with lloyd bentsen says hell be fighting off 
butterflies but will be ready for the critical confrontation 
i will be prepared ill be ready he vowed during a 
predebate interview with the associated press 
polls show many voters are skeptical about quayles 
qualifications and quayle said he sees the debate as his golden 
opportunity to resolve their doubts but the indiana senator 
sought to play down the debates impact on the election 
it is important and the american people will be able to see 
the two vice presidential nominees he said but when they go 
in that voting booth theyre going to be voting for a president of 
the united states and thats where their attention is going to be 
and thats where the election is going to be decided 
quayle will focus his attacks on democrat michael dukakis rather 
than the texas senator whom quayle sees as more in tune with 
republicans than democrats 
the opponent for me is michael dukakis hes the one thats 
running for president hes the one that if he would get in i 
think itd be very difficult time for this country the senator 
from texas is the vice presidential nominee and my target and my 
discussion and my focus that evening will be on the governor from 
massachusetts quayle said 
quayle will field the first question from the panel of 
journalists at the omaha neb debate he has been closeted with 
top advisers at an undisclosed location in the washington area 
boning up on the issues and conducting mock debates with bentsens 
standin sen bob packwood rore 
he admits to some nervousness but says that should evaporate 
i wont really get the butterflies going probably until 
wednesday but theyll be there theres no doubt he said 
adding that he expects to be very much in control by the time 
the debate begins 
quayles embattled tenure as george bushs running mate has been 
marked by intense media scrutiny into his military service 
academic record and personal life he has made a number of 
highprofile gaffes telling reporters at one point i didnt 
live in this century among other things 
the problem is that every time theres just one little miscue 
it gets amplified as if this is the standard operating procedure 
which its not he said 
but quayle said he is not worried about making such miscues 
on wednesday 
the reason im not is because its going to be questions and 
answers theres always that possibility but im a very confident 
person he said and the american people will be able to see me 
in an unedited version for the first time since new orleans and 
its going to be a great opportunity for me 
gop strategists have said that because quayle has been portrayed 
as a caricature and lightweight candidate he should benefit from 
the low expecations for his performance in essence they suggest 
anything short of a major blunder will allow him to come away 
looking good 
im treating it as an opportunity to get up there respond to 
the questions tell the american people where i want to lead this 
country with george bush and articulate a vision for the 
future so i dont look at it as low expectations high 
expectations ill leave that to others quayle said what i 
perceive this debate as is a golden opportunity for me to just be 
myself 
aides have said they want quayle to tone down his boyish 
exuberance so he will appear dignified and mature beside the 
67yearold bentsen they are said to be advising him to speak 
slower and perhaps to rein in the wild gesticulating he sometimes 
exhibits 
but quayle said he is not worried about looking less experienced 
than bentsen who has 18 years in the senate and speaks with a 
dignified and patrician air 
age alone is not the only qualification for vice president or 
president you have to look at experience youve got to look at 
judgment youve got to look if you can make a difference i 
believe i can make a difference like i have made a difference 
in areas like job training and national defense he said

justice anthony m kennedy may hold the 
decisive vote on such issues as civil rights affirmative action 
the death penalty and drugtesting that the supreme court will take 
up in its new term beginning today 
many experts say kennedy beginning his first full term since 
becoming a justice last february could determine whether the 
courts erratic 20year drift toward conservatism will accelerate 
dramatically 
over the next nine months the court has agreed to rule on these 
issues 
the death penalty for convicted murderers who committed their 
crimes before reaching age 18 
the death penalty for mentally retarded killers 
the power of local governments to require that a certain 
percentage of public works projects be awarded to minorityowned 
construction businesses 
mandatory drug testing for railroad employees involved in 
serious accidents and for people seeking drugenforcement jobs 
within the us customs service 
the continued vitality of a 1976 supreme court decision used to 
fight private or nongovernmental racial discrimination 
the court could be deeply divided on each issue 
were not sure where he lines up thomas krattenmaker dean 
of the georgetown university law school said of kennedy it will 
be interesting to see whether kennedy takes the middle road or opts 
for a more ideological route 
an anticipated bellwether for kennedy and the court is a north 
carolina case involving charges of onthejob racial harassment 
the justices with kennedy on the side of the majority voted 54 
last april to use the case to reconsider a 1976 decision called 
runyon vs mccrary 
in the 1976 decision the court said racially segregated private 
schools violate federal civil rights law when they refuse to admit 
black students the ruling let civil rights groups use that law as 
a weapon in attacking other forms of private bias as well 
justice harry a blackmun recently told a group of law students 
in arkansas i think the outcome of the case will be of some 
significance as to the movement of the court during the balance of 
the 20th century 
marsha levick executive director of the national organization 
for womens legal arm said kennedys votes in the north carolina 
case and other pending civil rights disputes are key 
anthony kennedy is absolutely someone to watch he has not 
been generous in his reading of civil rights laws as a federal 
appeals court judge she said 
blackmun author of the high courts 1973 decision legalizing 
abortion told his arkansas audience that kennedys views on the 
issue as yet unknown could put the landmark roe vs wade ruling 
in jeopardy if a new abortion case wins the courts review 
the next question is will roe vs wade go down the drain i 
think theres a very distinct possibility it will this term 
blackmun said 
four court members chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor 
have criticized the 1973 decision 
krattenmaker warned against judging kennedy by his initial 
votes noting that in his early years on the court blackmun was 
considered a staunch conservative but is now viewed as a leading 
liberal on many issues 
noting that blackmun soon will be 80 and that the courts two 
leading liberals justices william j brennan and thurgood 
marshall are in their 80s krattenmaker said we must look for 
signs or signals that one or more of the justices is considering 
retirement 
the courts conservatives are much younger rehnquist is 63 
white 71 scalia 52 oconnor 58 and kennedy 52 
the courts ninth member justice john paul stevens is 68 
here in summary form are some of the cases the supreme court 
is expected to decide this term

should capital punishment be banned for all murderers not yet

participate in that case but will take part in deciding similar 
cases from georgia and missouri this term 
should mentally retarded killers be executed for their crimes 
the court is studying the case of a texas murderer who has the 
mental capacity of a 7yearold

a leader of the soviet blocs only 
independent national youth group said the group would benefit from 
the sweeping political changes engineered by mikhail s gorbachev 
in the soviet union last weekend 
gabor fodor of the union of young democrats or fidesz said the 
strengthening of gorbachevs power in the soviet union would boost 
the reform wing of hungarys communist party which would in turn 
give the youth group freer reign 
they the authorities wont attack fidesz as hard and will 
allow it to work fodor said sunday 
gorbachev the soviet communist party leader engineered a major 
overhaul of the soviet power structure in which he also assumed the 
presidency the top government 
fidesz was established in march as an alternative to hungarys 
communist youth group kisz which had lost thousands of members in 
recent years communist officials initially branded fidesz illegal 
and pressured it to cease its activities 
later authorities softened their criticisms 
about 700 people attended a twoday meeting over the weekend at 
budapests jurta theater to discuss the statutes of fidesz fodor 
a member of the groups sixman governing body said the first 
congress was a school of democracy for us 
he said the political weight of the organization is stronger 
than its membership of about 1500 indicates 
the authorities are afraid of us because we are young and have 
a clean slate fodor said 
janos lukacs a member of the ruling communist party politburo 
told a central committee meeting last week that fidesz was 
attempting to thwart dialogue and rejected what he called the 
aggressive stand of the group 
laszlo koever another founder of fidesz countered that the 
party leadership should be happy about the spread of grassroots 
organizations and should recognize fideszs readiness for dialogue 
fidesz hopes to become fully legal under a new law of 
association and assembly to be passed by parliament in december 
fodor said fidesz supports the reform wing of the communist 
party most closely identified with politburo members imre pozsgay 
and reszo nyers 
on sept 12 pozsgay who was promoted to the politburo in a 
power shuffle in may received a fivemember delegation from fidesz 
fodor who was a member of the delegation said pozsgay advised 
the group not to press certain issues he said they could not 
achieve progress on now such as a reevaluation of the 1956 
anticommunist revolt or a withdrawal of soviet troops 
however pozsgay did not suggest the group stop its activities 
fodor said 
fidesz is to hold a second congress in november to adopt a final 
political program 
peter veres a spokesman for the group said fidesz advocates a 
multiparty system and decreased defense spending and would like to 
field candidates for parliament

the reagan administration expects to be able 
to institute nonmilitary training programs for the nicaraguan 
contras under a new humanitarian aid package us officials say 
the old aid program which expired last friday allowed the 
administration to use the 177 million package only for food 
clothing medical services and shelter 
the new 27 million sixmonth package signed into law by 
president reagan on saturday calls for assistance in the same four 
areas but the word only has been deleted that will permit the 
administration greater flexibility in how the money is spent 
in signing the 143 billion foreign aid bill reagan criticized 
what he said was a minimal amount of humanitarian aid for the 
contras 
us officials speaking only on condition they not be named 
said they envision ussponsored skills training in areas 
ranging from radio maintenance to record keeping human rights and 
health care 
the officials said such programs should boost the morale of the 
thousands of rebels who are camped along the hondurannicaraguan 
border 
many of the rebels flocked to these camps from inside nicaragua 
over the past six months to take advantage of the assistance 
programs being carried out in the border area by the agency for 
international development 
no deliveries were made inside nicaragua because agreement could 
not be reached with the sandinista government on an acceptable 
delivery system 
the officials said they expect opposition to the proposed 
training programs from some members of congress 
the prospects for a renewal of military aid for the rebels are 
not good the aid package initially approved by the senate in 
august authorized the release of 165 million in stockpiled 
military equipment under certain conditions 
but the funds would require congressional approval before 
adjournment of the current session and there is only about a week 
left before members go home the next session of congress begins in 
january 
there has been no attempt by the administration to trigger a 
vote on release of the funds 
congress rejected an administration military aid request on feb 
3 and the formal cutoff of weapons deliveries to the contras 
occurred on feb 29 
the majority of the contras have since resettled along the 
border area faced with the prospect that their principal 
benefactor the united states can no longer be relied on to aid in 
their quest to topple the sandinista government 
according to officials the contras have some ammunition left 
but are no match for the sandinistas who received an estimated 
400 million in military equipment from the soviet union during the 
first eight months of the year

rep dennis eckart says he refused to dye 
his hair but in every other way the ohio congressman has tried to 
transform himself into dan quayle as democratic vice presidential 
candidate lloyd bentsen readies for wednesday nights debate 
i played abraham lincoln in 4th grade so ive played a 
republican before quips eckart who is standing in for the gop 
vice presidential nominee in mock debates with bentsen 
actually eckart the former high school and college actor now 
in his fourth term in the house has played a variety of roles 
including a walter mondale for ohio sen john glenns campaign four 
years ago 
like quayle eckart is a young handsome midwesterner although 
darkhaired and not blond like quayle at 38 eckart is actually 
three years younger than the indiana senator but at this point he 
feels he knows him well 
hes a cheerleader hes very enthusiastic about what he 
does says the democrat who in the spirit of the indiana 
senator wore a golf tee tucked over one ear and carried a putter 
on the campaign jet sunday 
ive spent a lot of time on the practice tee at congressional 
country club since getting called to play quayle about three 
weeks ago he joked 
eckart says he has studied quayles congressional record and 
hours of videotapes of his television performances including the 
1980 debates against sen birch bayh dind whom quayle defeated 
to enter the senate 
dan actually took him apart repeatedly he said 
eckart says the format for wednesdays debate in omaha neb 
with questions from reporters twominute answers and oneminute 
replies favors quayle it will be a series of oneminute sound 
bites and thats where dan quayle is absolutely at his best 
he said 
i think its a grievous mistake to underestimate quayles 
debating ability especially on television he said 
i think dan is the consummate mediaage politician he said 
i think wednesday night is playing on dan quayles home court 
and this time dan has got the best handlers in the world 
he said referring to bush media adviser roger ailes who is 
overseeing quayles preparations 
eckart presented bentsen with an inscribed golf ball the words 
are a campaign secret when he mock debated bentsen for the first 
time sunday morning in a washington dc hotel room he plans 
another performance today in austin where bentsen is cramming for 
the debate 
eckart is separated from bentsen except when they debate he 
says he doesnt know either bentsen or quayle very well although 
he has worked with both of them occasionally in congress 
he refuses to disclose the contents of sundays session but he 
says his research unearthed some zingers quayle might use i sent 
them a couple of staffers scurrying out of the room he bragged 
eckart says he enjoys getting into the head of people hes 
playing asked what he found inside quayles head he laughed and 
said room to maneuver it was about the only negative thing he 
had to say about quayles ability 
in playing the indiana senator eckart says he tried to 
duplicate his mannerisms and his point of view but it is difficult 
to predict what attitude quayle will bring to the debate since it 
wont be what he calls the vintage dan quayle of waving his 
arms to stir up the crowds 
thats a wild card he says

the government has declined to 
confirm or deny reports that president pw botha promised to free 
imprisoned black activist nelson mandela 
in a joint communique released after bothas meeting saturday 
with president mobutu sese seko of zaire mobutu said he was 
encouraged by the flexible approach taken by botha regarding 
mandela 
mobutu was quoted sunday in the washington post as saying i 
obtained from botha a firm commitment that mandela will soon be 
freed without any conditions that he will be allowed to return to 
his home without any constraints 
a french news report also said president botha told mobutu he 
would release mandela 
the report was at first denied by roland darroll a foreign 
ministry spokesman darroll said mobutu if quoted properly was 
overstating the gist of the summit discussion 
however a statement issued later by foreign minister pik botha 
avoided contradicting mobutu and left open the possibility 
president botha may indeed have made some type of promise 
the statement said the only agreed version of the discussion 
concerning mr mandelas release is contained in a joint communique 
issued at the conclusion of the talks 
mandela 70 is considered the most popular leader among south 
africas disenfranchised black majority he has been jailed since 
1962 and is serving a life term for sabotage and conspiracy to 
overthrow the government 
the post quoted mobutu as saying in a telephone interview that 
botha gave his solemn promise he will not send mandela back to 
prison once he recovers from tuberculosis in a cape town nursing 
home 
botha frequently has said he would release mandela in exchange 
for mandelas renunciation of violence mandela has refused to 
repudiate the violent tactics of the outlawed african national 
congress the main group fighting south africas government

president reagan doesnt like everything he 
sees in the new spending measures for 1989 but he says congress 
still deserves a pat on the back for getting its work done on time 
this year 
reagan who signed the last of 13 major spending bills on 
saturday the first day of fiscal 1989 said for the first time 
in years all the governments budgetary work is done 
the last of the governments 13 appropriations bill have been 
delivered to me and i have signed them he said in his weekly 
radio address just hours after congress approved the money to keep 
federal agencies operating 
the usually rancorous budget process was eased this year because 
congress and the white house had cut deals that virtually 
guaranteed approval of the spending bills even before reagan 
introduced his budget 
it was the first time since 1976 that the house and senate both 
controlled by democrats had passed the bills separately and on 
time 
congress deserves a pat on the back for completing all 13 
separate appropriations bills for a fiscal year reagan said 
they worked long and hard to meet this years deadline 
but reagan criticized as minimal the amount of humanitarian aid 
congress granted the contra rebels of nicaragua and chided 
lawmakers for approving a protectionist textile bill that he 
vetoed earlier in the week 
had reagan signed all the bills before 1201 am edt saturday 
as he had hoped it would have been the first time since 1948 that 
all appropriations bills were enacted before the start of the new 
fiscal year 
last year reagan signed a 600 billion catchall spending bill 
but he threatened to exercise his veto if a similar measure was put 
on his desk this year 
reagan signed six appropriations bills saturday including a 
282 billion defense spending bill and a 143 billion foreign aid 
measure the other bills were signed earlier 
the usual ferocity over spending priorities was tempered by the 
desire of the administration and congressional democrats to avoid a 
repeat of last years embarrassing budget finale 
but it remained to be seen if the spending measures would fall 
in line with strictures of the grammrudman balanced budget law 
which requires a deficit of 146 billion for fiscal 1989 
if the deficit should surpass 146 billion when it is measured 
on oct 15 spending would have to be cut acrosstheboard by at 
least 10 billion an amount that would cause political pain for 
lawmakers in an election year

republican dan quayle believes the vice presidential debate will 
enable the gop contender to dispel doubts harbored by some voters 
about his candidacy democrat lloyd bentsen still uncomfortable 
with the format is relying on mock debates and intense preparation 
to ready for the encounter 
the tickets top candidates republican george bush and 
democrat michael dukakis took a day off from campaigning sunday 
while their running mates crammed for wednesday nights matchup in 
omaha neb 
quayle in a predebate interview with the associated press 
said that although the vice presidential encounter is important 
the determining factor for american voters is the candidate for the 
white house and the indiana senator will direct his attacks at 
the democratic nominee 
the opponent for me is michael dukakis hes the one thats 
running for president quayle said the senator from texas is 
the vice presidential nominee and my target and my discussion and 
my focus that evening will be on the governor from massachusetts 
dukakis who spent sunday in boston was traveling to an 
elementary school in hartford conn today before attending a 
rally on the statehouse steps the democratic nominee also was 
visiting dearbornheights mich to watch the incineration of 
confiscated drugs at a local sanitation plant 
bush was greeting the return of the space shuttle discovery and 
its fiveman crew at edwards air force base in california the vice 
president was planning a campaign stop later in the day in redding 
a growing northern california city 
meanwhile a statewide poll in heavilydemocratic maryland found 
the two candidates in a virtual dead heat with bush leading dukakis 
4844 percent the survey of 889 registered voters conducted for 
the baltimore sun monday through thursday had a margin of error of 
plus or minus 33 percentage points 
the vice presidential candidates cleared their campaign 
schedules to concentrate on the debate while workers at the civic 
auditorium in omaha readied the hall after a performance by a 
christian rock band and an terry forsberg is decorating the 
candidates dressing rooms with carpeting and drapes 
theyll look like your living room or better yet theirs 
forsberg said 
quayle holed up with top advisers at an undisclosed location in 
the washington dc area and conducted mock debates with 
bentsens standin sen bob packwood rore 
the indiana senator said he was not concerned about possible 
gaffes during the debate a problem for the candidate during his 
campaign appearances 
the reason im not is because its going to be questions and 
answers theres always that possibility but im a very confident 
person he said 
republican strategists believe expectations remain low for 
quayles performance based on his miscues and reputation as a 
lightweight candidate but the indiana senator says he is not 
giving much consideration to expectations 
the american people will be able to see me in an unedited 
version for the first time since new orleans and its going to be 
a great opportunity for me he said 
bentsen meanwhile held a mock debate with quayle standin 
rep dennis eckart dohio and then flew to austin texas to 
devote his time to debate preparation 
in the mock session eckarts attacks sent staffers scurrying 
for research material and left bentsen a bit uncomfortable with 
the debate format 90 minutes of questions twominute responses 
and oneminute rebuttals 
he does not seem relaxed said bentsens spokesman mike 
mccurry if it were the senate floor hed be very comfortable and 
if it were the senate rules he would be very comfortable 
susan estrich dukakis campaign manager also downplayed 
expectations for the texas senator an oddson favorite based on 
his experience 
i have a lot of confidence in senator bentsen but dan quayle 
is a very effective debater she said

a nuclear reactor which once powered a soviet spy satellite but 
say there no longer is a danger of radioactive debris falling to 
earth 
the reactor earlier had been ejected from the satellite kosmos 
1900 and sent into a higher orbit where it does not pose a threat 
to earth officials said 
maj alex mondragon a spokesman for the us space commands 
space surveillance center in cheyenne mountain colo said sunday 
that the rest of the soviet satellite has disintegrated and poses 
no danger 
two pieces fell to earth along the eastern coast of africa on 
saturday he said 
theres no danger i think its over he said in a 
telephone interview 
mondragon said the nuclear reactor is still being tracked in its 
higher orbit it should stay up there for a number of years he 
said 
the federal emergency management agency on saturday lifted a 
nationwide alert which had been imposed earlier when there was 
concern some radioactive debris might fall to earth

the du pont co facing criticism for its 
operation of nuclear weapons reactors at the savannah river plant 
insists its commitment to safety at the south carolina facility is 
unyielding 
we were appalled and dismayed to read news accounts which 
assert that we have in any way posed a nuclear safety threat to our 
employees or the public the company said in a statement on 
sunday 
our record of performance in radiation control and nuclear 
safety clearly indicates the opposite it said in fact we 
have never had an employee experience a single day of lost work 
from any nuclear incident 
the safety of the department of energy reactors came under heavy 
criticism at a congressional hearing friday 
a 1985 memorandum disclosed at the hearing listed 30 incidents 
at the five savannah river reactors between 1957 and 1985 they 
included one in which fuel rods melted and another in which a chain 
reaction nearly went out of control 
there are currently some senior managers within the department 
with an attitude toward production reactor safety which on the face 
seems to be similar to that which existed in the space program 
prior to the shuttle challenger accident said another memo 
released at the hearing 
that memo was written sept 16 by richard starostecki a deputy 
assistant energy secretary 
in a statement provided by clif webb a du pont spokesman at the 
savannah river plant the company said all 30 incidents cited in 
the 1985 memo were in the formal reactor incident reporting 
system 
also it said the report was reviewed with du ponts reactor 
safety advisory committee in may 1985 and with the national academy 
of sciences in october 1986 
refuting allegations that it had withheld or covered up 
information du pont said it has provided daily and monthly 
operations reports to doe maintained a formal reactor incident 
reporting system since 1957 provided semiannual summary reports of 
reactor incidents to du pont and doe management for the past 20 
years and shared reactor incident report information with the news 
media 
our commitment to the safe operation of the savannah river 
plant the safety of our employees and the protection of public 
health and safety is unyielding the company said

thousands of members of an estonian 
nationalist group demanded greater autonomy for their republic and 
charged the kremlin with sapping estonias agricultural resources 
causing suffering and food shortages 
soviet authorities are to blame for our suffering here the 
lack of food here delegate albert danielson told more than 3000 
members of the fledgling peoples front sunday at the groups first 
congress in tallinn the picturesque capital of this republic on 
the baltic sea 
some speakers objected to what they called the moscows 
colonialist policy in which the government siphons off 
estonias agricultural output and manufactured goods 
we have been reduced to the level of slaves in a manor 
farmer enno peets told the cheering delegates 
the blue black and white flag of the independent estonian 
republic that existed between the two world wars was brought to the 
town hall stage during closing ceremonies sunday that featured 
singing of the nationalist song fatherland 
the twoday conference opened saturday with an address by 
estonias communist party chief vajno vyalyas who greeted the 
group in the name of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
official sanction for the meeting was an indication of the 
changing attitudes of authorities who until recently would have 
jailed those espousing nationalist sentiments 
the issue of ethnic relations is an important one for gorbachev 
who is beset by unrest among the soviet unions more than 100 
ethnic groups 
unrest has been particularly troublesome here and in two other 
baltic republics lithuania and latvia as well as in the southern 
republics of armenia and azerbaijan 
the soviet union took over the baltic republics under a 1939 
agreement with nazi germany 
the peoples front formed in april says it does not challenge 
the authority of the communist party and is not interested in 
breaking away from the soviet union but some members say privately 
that their ultimate goal is independence 
the group claims membership of 60000 of estonias 15 million 
people 
vyalyas told a news conference that the republics reforms are 
always favorably accepted by gorbachev but that some proposals 
go too far 
our wills and wishes have certain limits when fantasy goes 
too far from reality we must stop these things he told reporters 
a clear sign of recent liberalization was the presence at the 
congress of an estonian nationalist who has spent much of his life 
in labor camps for his views 
mart niklus released in july after serving eight years in his 
most recent term could be immediately spotted in a sea of business 
suits by his dark gray and black striped camp uniform the 
54yearold niklus said some ideas expressed at the congress were 
similar to those that sent him to the camps 
the delegates passed nearly two dozen resolutions sunday 
including one demanding that the 1939 agreement in which estonia 
became part of the soviet union be renounced 
another resolution urged the estonian government and the 
communist party to stop the flow of people of other nationalities 
into the republic where ethnic estonians make up 60 percent of the 
population 
the resolutions have no legal force but the communist party and 
government already have endorsed many of the groups demands 
in a speech saturday vyalyas strongly backed demands to wrest 
control from government ministries in moscow over the republics 
economic and cultural affairs 
peets in remarks that brought delegates to their feet said he 
had been a collective farmer for 34 years and was incensed that 
soviet leaders including gorbachev propose renting state land to 
farmers to spur productivity 
he said his ancestors bought land when estonia was independent 
and that it was the state that should have been paying him rent 
without naming the peoples front specifically gorbachev and 
the kremlin leadership have expressed support for populist 
movements and endorsed estonianproposed reforms for putting the 
republics economy in the hands of local managers and preserving 
the native culture and language

bushs margin was one percentage wider than the lead he held in 
a similar time national survey in august and it was a few 
percentage points more than other national polls have given the gop 
nominee in recent weeks

fairly well or very well the highest proportion since october

issues of the campaign only 41 percent said the same of dukakis

make important presidential decisions

thousands of civil servants and factory 
workers heeded stern official warnings and returned to work today 
as the military government appeared to have broken burmas first 
general strike in 26 years 
attendance figures were not available but some government 
officials said about 80 percent of the workers were expected to be 
back at their jobs rather than face dismissal or other punishment 
anyone who prevents obstructs or interferes with workers 
returning to work on oct 3 will be dealt with sternly the 
government warned in press and radio announcements sunday the 
government had earlier warned that workers who did not report back 
today could be fired 
opposition parties have urged strikers to stay away from their 
jobs hoping to pressure the current government which was formed 
following a sept 18 military coup lead by hardliner gen saw maung 
western diplomats say a general strike which began aug 8 
appears to be the last effective weapon of prodemocracy forces in 
burma which since late july have tried to topple an entrenched 
authoritarian system 
we have to go back we need money our salaries and the 
special rations of rice and oil one returning government clerk 
said 
some government employes returned to work last week and drew 
their september salaries on sept 30 they were also given special 
rations of rice and edible oil both in short supply in rangoon as 
a result of the political upheaval and strike 
the strike was the first mass labor agitation since strongman ne 
win seized power in 1962 and instituted a militarybacked 
oneparty system which advocated socialism trade unions were 
hastily formed after the aug 8 strike but without funds to support 
striking workers or real organizational experience 
still it appeared unlikely that the government machinery and 
stateowned factories would regain momentum in the near future 
some civil servants were seen loitering near shops after signing 
attendance registers in their offices asked why they were in the 
streets instead of at their desks one said there is no work in 
the office at the moment 
virtually all of the countrys more than 1000 factories had 
ceased operations because of the strike and are faced with lack of 
spare parts and raw materials a large number have been ransacked 
by looters who have taken away or destroyed machinery and materials 
a recent television report showed cigarette factories and a soap 
factory in northern rangoon totally destroyed looters of many 
enterprises even stripped off tin roofs which are selling at 
inflated prices on the black market 
banks reopened but only to handle salaries and pensions of 
government employes servicing of private accounts has not begun 
already in crisis when the antigovernment movement began 
experts say burmas economy is shattered 
burmas major aid donor japan has stopped sending assistance 
in recent weeks while west germany and the united states have 
frozen all but humanitarian aid in reaction to the ruthless 
suppression of dissent by the authorities 
by official count about 425 persons have been killed since the 
sept 18 coup western diplomats and opposition figures say 
casualties were far higher while several thousand are reliably 
believe to have died as the military put down earlier 
demonstrations 
the government has promised general elections and allowed 
political parties to register thus formally breaking the monopoly 
on power held by the burma socialist program party since 1962 
however this party now renamed the national unity party is 
solidly entrenched and has a nationwide organizational network 
the strongest of the opposition groups the national league for 
democracy does not even have a central office and virtually no 
funds 
the league has not yet announced whether it would contest the 
elections 
ne win resigned in july and was replaced by sein lwin a 
hardline military man he too resigned after massive 
antigovernment protests and was replaced by maung maung a 
civilian saw maung ousted maung maung

the soviet unions newly appointed kgb chief is a 
veteran of the secret police force but unlike his predecessors he 
was not given a seat on the communist partys ruling politburo 
vladimir a kryuchkov 64 was named kgb chief saturday by the 
supreme soviet shortly after the nations parliament elected 
mikhail s gorbachev president 
kryuchkov replaced viktor m chebrikov a full politburo member 
since 1985 and kgb chief since 1982 chebrikov remained on the 
12man politburo but he was shifted to responsibility for legal 
affairs in a newly streamlined apparatus of the partys 
policymaking central committee 
the 300member central committee also added alexander v vlasov 
who as interior minister is in charge of uniformed police to the 
nonvoting politburo members that move could enhance the status of 
the uniformed police over the kgb in gorbachevs new power 
structure 
few details are known about kryuchkov who became deputy 
chairman of the kgb in november 1978 
in a fourparagraph biographical sketch the official news 
agency tass said kryuchkov who holds the rank of an army general 
held senior posts on the security force for more than 20 years 
tass said he trained as a lawyer and worked several years as a 
prosecutor he also served on the central committee staff from 1959 
to 1967

unlike an airplane that 
can circle an airport for hours when the shuttle glides to earth 
without power it gets only one chance to land 
theres no opportunity to go around youve got to hit it the 
first time said bob evans chief of the air force research 
projects office at this mojave desert military base 80 miles 
northeast of los angeles where discovery was to end its fourday 
mission at 937 am pdt today 
the task of landing begins half a world away from edwards air 
force base and reentry could result in the orbiter burning up in 
the atmosphere if it is done incorrectly 
here is how nasa says a textbook landing would progress 
after the astronauts have put on their new emergency escape 
suits the pilot positions the shuttle upsidedown and tailfirst 
he then fires small rockets in what is called the deorbit burn 
an hour before landing flight computers fire other thrusters to 
flip the shuttle forward again for reentry 
the computer guidance system helps keep the shuttle at the 
proper angle for reentry and the national aeronautics and space 
administration also has modified discoverys heatshielding tiles 
and blankets to improve the crafts ability to withstand heat 
once the shuttle descends to 75 miles above earths surface it 
enters the atmosphere at about 25 times the speed of sound it is 
then about 5000 miles west of edwards air force base 
the pilot monitors computer controls to perform energy 
management which means making sturns and other maneuvers to 
reduce the shuttles speed as it approaches the landing site said 
milt thompson chief engineer for nasas dryden flight research 
facility here 
if he doesnt control his energy accurately enough he may 
overshoot edwards and not have a place to land or undershoot and 
land in the water thompson said 
heat from reentry ionizes atoms of air around the shuttle when 
it is about 50 miles above the earth and about 25 minutes before 
landing that has the effect of blacking out groundtoshuttle 
communications for about 13 minutes until the orbiter is 30 miles 
above the planet and heading toward the california coast 
once it descends to about 10 miles altitude thrusters no longer 
can move the orbiter so control depends on flaps rudders and 
speed brakes which are run by a hydraulic system powered by three 
auxiliary power units or apus 
according to a study by an engineering consulting firm 
commissioned by nasa and mcdonnell douglas corp there is a 
onein70 chance that all three apus will fail during landing and 
cause the shuttle to crash nasa contends the risk is far lower 
at an altitude of about 22 miles or 115400 feet the shuttle 
crosses californias coastline near santa barbara at a speed 437 
times the speed of sound 
from that point until the orbiter slows below the speed of sound 
minutes before landing anyone under the flight path will hear two 
loud sonic booms as the shuttles nose and wings zip through the 
air 
approaching from the west the shuttle flies east over edwards 
and circles north west and then south as it continues to slow and 
glides toward its unpaved runway on rogers dry lake 
it angles downward at about 21 degrees seven times steeper than 
the path of a commercial jet before leveling out 17 seconds before 
landing 
it comes down like a streamlined brick thompson said 
the commander usually starts to control the shuttle manually at 
this point pulling the nose up to reduce speed the pilot opens 
doors to deploy the landing gear 14 seconds before touchdown 
normal touchdown occurs at a speed between 210 and 225 mph and 
the shuttle rolls to a halt in about 8000 feet 
discoverys commander frederick h hauck was asked during a 
news conference from space sunday to describe the final moments of 
landing 
well be coming in just about between los angeles and santa 
barbara overhead the coast at about 110000 feet and circling 
around and we hope if the weather permits and the winds permit to 
land on edwards runway 17 
well pass overhead the field at about 40000 feet becoming 
subsonic you all can hear as were supersonic a double sonic boom 
when you hear that youll know were about five minutes from 
landing and then well make a standard approach 300 miles per 
hour coming down to a touchdown at 200 miles per hour on that 
lakebed 
nasa has modified discoverys braking and steering systems in 
hope of avoiding the brake and tire damage that occurred during 
earlier landings 
the crew once steered shuttles down the runway by applying 
differential pressure to brakes but that caused brake overheating 
and damage now a backup nosewheel steering system has been 
installed so the shuttle could be steered straight in crosswinds or 
if tires blew out 
nasa also installed a thicker main landing gear axle put holes 
in brake pistons to prevent pressure surges modified controls to 
equalize pressure on adjacent brakes and installed thicker brake 
discs 
at the urging of astronauts and the rogers commission which 
investigated the jan 28 1986 challenger launch disaster shuttles 
will land here for the foreseeable future frustrating nasas 
initial plans to save time and money by landing the spacecraft 
regularly back at the cape canaveral fla launch site 
the 44squaremile dry lakebed at edwards leaves plenty of room 
for safety if brakes fail or tires blow out 
eighteen previous flights landed here five at cape canaveral 
and one at white sands missile range nm

in a key opposition victory the 
supreme court paved the way for open elections later this year by 
ruling that political party may field candidates 
the decision sunday by the nations highest court overturned a 
decree by the late president mohammed zia ulhaq that candidates 
must run as individuals unaffiliated with political parties 
the ruling was a victory for opposition leader benazir bhutto 
who had claimed zias decree was unconstitutional and would 
unfairly favor governing party candidates 
pakistan today has a real chance of moving towards national 
unity ms bhutto said in a telephone interview from her 
residence in the southern port of karachi where she is resting 
following the birth of her first child sept 21 
representative government will be set up which would work 
for the peace and stability of the country ms bhutto said 
with candidates allowed to run on a party basis ms bhuttos 
pakistan peoples party is expected to do well in november 
elections against zia loyalists who are split into two factions of 
the centerright pakistan muslim league 
the ruling could also help pakistan return to democratic rule 
after 11 years under zia a military general who imposed eight 
years of martial law during his time in office 
zia who ousted ms bhuttos father prime minister zulfikar 
ali bhutto in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged two years 
later was killed in a plane crash aug 17 the cause of the crash 
is under investigation 
in may zia dismissed the 3yearold civilian government of 
prime minister mohammad khan junejo and dissolved parliament 
saying it was corrupt and incompetent he named a caretaker 
government and scheduled elections nov 16 
zias successor former senate chairman ghulam ishaq khan 
promised to continue the late presidents policies until the 
november election but asked the supreme court to decide whether the 
vote should be held on a party basis 
after the ruling was announced caretaker justice minister wasim 
sajjad announced a list of reforms to the countrys election laws 
to combat cheating and streamline the electoral process 
among other things sajjad said the cabinet 
gave the federal election commission the power to suspend any 
officer immediately on suspicion of impropriety 
eased requirements for a candidates registration 
required the use of national identity cards to prevent multiple 
voting 
raised the maximum campaign spending limits 
pakistanis still are awaiting a ruling from the supreme court on 
the constitutionality of zias dismissal of the civilian government 
a federal high court on sept 27 ruled that zias action was 
unconstitutional thus implying that the caretaker government was 
illegitimate 
ishaq khan appealed the decision to the supreme court in order 
to assure that the caretaker government remain in office until the 
elections the justices are expected to rule on that case early 
this week

the value of nicaraguas currency has 
dropped 77 percent and the price of gasoline has doubled in this 
years fourth round of economic measures designed to shore up a 
battered economy 
the official exchange rate for the national currency the 
cordoba went from 180 to the dollar to 320 to the dollar over the 
weekend the governmentcontrolled exchange rate available for 
only a handful of transactions such as those involving medical 
supplies allows 485 cordobas to the dollar 
gasoline rose from the equivalent of 102 a gallon to 203 a 
gallon a month ago it sold for the equivalent of 46 cents a 
gallon 
state workers will get an immediate 35 percent raise the 
government said 
the leftist government blames the 8yearold war with us 
backed rebels known as contras for economic woes that include 
rampant inflation shortages of food and fuel and a shrinking 
economy 
president daniel ortega described similar economic steps taken a 
month ago as a matter of survival until nicaragua is at peace 
planning minister alejandro martinez cuenca said the most recent 
devaluation is designed to establish a realistic relationship 
between prices in the domestic and international markets 
according to the official newspaper of the ruling sandinista party 
barricada 
the sandinista government began making economic adjustments in 
february when inflation was said officially to be at 1300 
percent a series of devaluations and gasoline price hikes have 
followed 
many wage and price controls were lifted in june

gosh its been a long and contentious campaign 
year here in the united states of america consider instead the way 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev runs for president quietly 
spending little money insulting none of his opponents oblivious 
to the polls gracious in victory 
our political parties should pay attention to the cardcarrying 
communists over in moscow 
take last friday for example 
that was the day when practically out of nowhere the central 
committee met to consider personnel shifts at the top level of the 
communist party the meeting was important because the party has 
held power in moscow since 1917 and so central committee decisions 
tend to have wide influence over government 
prevailing in the central committee is like winning a democratic 
primary for congress in west virginia 
and what were michael dukakis and george bush up to on friday 
the democrat began his day with a farm rally in idalou texas 
en route to the famous stringfellow toxic waste site near 
riverside calif and a town meeting at rubidoux high school then 
on to san francisco for a dinner honoring party fundraiser walter 
shorenstein 
bush a cardcarrying republican enjoyed a similarly exciting 
day the schedule called for a morning student assembly at 
ridgefield memorial high in new jersey then a meeting with 
archbishop whealon of hartford conn before a rally at st 
josephs college 
of course these presidential candidates cant be everywhere at 
once so they send their running mates out too lloyd bentsen 
began his day at the first union plaza in charlotte nc dan 
quayle was at the great american firehouse exposition and muster in 
philadelphia 
during fridays central committee meeting andrei gromyko gave 
up his party positions and sources expected that just 24 hours 
later at a meeting of the supreme soviet he would quit as 
president too 
imagine the campaign that must have taken place in those 24 
hours as word rifled through the 10 time zones and 130 languages of 
the soviet union that gromyko had chosen to vacate the presidency 
his retirement created an immediate opening it was like ferdinand 
marcos calling a snap election 
gorbachev the general secretary of the communist party was an 
odds on favorite to win the job rather like ronald reagan running 
for reelection in 1984 
he had three things going for him in the whirlwind campaign for 
the presidency aside from the magnificent personality that leads 
american observers to speculate that hed be a great pol in a 
democracy as well as in a police state 
thing one he knew this snap election was imminent the ruling 
politburo having already decided to make some reforms and some 
personnel changes so he had time to prepare a platform and put 
together a majority coalition 
thing two gorbachev had recently been out on the stump in 
siberia siberian citizens freely expressed dismay over economic 
hardships pleas that may have energized gorbachev and sparked his 
effort to push quickly for the next stage of reform 
thing three his principal rival conservative yegor ligachev 
had been on vacation most of the preceding month anyone who 
follows politics knows that it is stupid to go on vacation just as 
a campaign is heating up former vice president walter mondale went 
fishing after the democratic national convention in 1984 and lost 
49 states including every state he failed to go fishing in 
gorbachev won his presidency before opponents could even 
schedule advertising time in the major media markets 
he was nominated saturday and when the presiding officer of the 
supreme soviet asked and who is against not one of the 1500 
legislators raised a hand the winner nodded smiling with his 
victory and a dozen other key personnel moves gorbachev had won a 
change that ultimately could set the stage for a crucial transfer 
of power from the communist party to the soviet government 
meanwhile dukakis and bush are intensifying their struggle for 
american popular support they are visiting tens of tarmacs and 
dozens of day care centers they will debate again they will 
exchange police endorsements poke at one anothers 
vulnerabilities slowly grudgingly they provide a glimpse of how 
they want to handle such issues as deficits aids star wars the 
contras even relations with the kremlin in response to the 
popular will they may shift a position dukakis more sympathetic 
to the pentagon bush more understanding of abortion and less 
tolerant of pollution or administration malfeasance 
theyll kiss a million babies shake a billion hands spend a 
zillion dollars and then after two years of this one of them gets 
to be president just like gorbachev ligachev in his absence 
they put him in charge of agriculture

in a corrugated metal complex that 
reverberates with echoes of aerospace history a team of 1000 
workers is building a replacement for the illfated space shuttle 
challenger 
the new orbiter vehicle is as yet unnamed it is a collection of 
titanium forgings machined parts and electronic boxes known at 
this stage of production only as ov105 
its letternumber designator sounds more fitting for a robot in 
a star wars film than a spacecraft in a fleet of shuttles 
bestowed the stately titles of atlantis discovery and columbia 
its not our job to give it a name shuttle production chief 
seymour z rubenstein of rockwell international the principal 
shuttle contractor said cheerfully in a recent interview thats 
the governments job 
actually the replacement shuttles name will be the brainstorm 
of school children who submit entries in a national competition 
that opens this fall 
after several elimination rounds the administrator of the 
national aeronautics and space administration will select a winner 
in may 1989 said bill green a rockwell international spokesman 
only one thing is certain about the name 
it definitely wont be challenger 2 or anything like that 
green said 
while ov105 waits for a name about 100 subcontractors and 
2000 rockwell shuttle program workers are giving the 13 billion 
orbiter its shape in downey a suburb of los angeles and in 
palmdale the mojave desert city 50 miles north of los angeles 
where final assembly is to take place 
already the space vehicles wings have sailed through the 
panama canal from grumman corp on new yorks long island on their 
journey to the mojave desert the nozzles that guide the orbiter as 
it flies through space hail from mcdonnell douglas corp in st 
louis other key components are made at rockwell facilities in 
oklahoma and ohio and additional parts are being flown in from 
dozens of other locations across the united states 
when the new shuttle is finished it will look almost exactly 
like the three others in the fleet 
essentially it will look the same said rubenstein 
president of rockwells space transportation systems division 
that there are no drastic changes from previous shuttles is a 
point of pride for rubenstein one of the principal original 
designers of the shuttle 
no other country could have built it he said its a 
welldesigned product built by a tremendously dedicated work 
force 
even though it looks the same as earlier orbiters it will 
incorporate all the improvements found necessary by the rogers 
commission which investigated the launch disaster that took the 
lives of the challenger crew 2 years ago 
most notable is a crew escape system a telescoping pole the 
crew could use to slide down and then parachute to the ground or 
into the water such a bailout system a version of which was added 
to discovery before its current flight could not have saved the 
challenger crew 
the new shuttle also will have upgraded electronics and an 
improved braking system changes that also are being incorporated 
into the rest of the shuttle fleet 
like its predecessors ov105 is taking shape in a complex where 
the apollo capsule and apollosoyuz command modules were built 
rockwell also built the x15 rocket plane and the p51 mustang 
fighter plane 
this company is rich in aviation and space heritage 
rubenstein said the company has a history of building aircraft 
and spacecraft that were on the leading edge 
congress gave the goahead to build the replacement shuttle on 
july 31 1987 it is scheduled to be delivered in april 1991 and 
fly in space in 1992 
work on production and assembly of the new orbiter is nearly 
half complete because the company got approval in 1983 to built a 
set of structural spare parts the spares were actually key 
components of a shuttle superstructure that were to be used if a 
shuttle was ever damaged 
no one had planned on the loss of a vehicle rubenstein said 
but after challenger the spare parts functioned like an 
insurance policy in speeding production of the replacement 
orbiter many major shuttle components like the aft fuselage 
section take as long as five years to machine because they must be 
forged from titanium and measured to a high degree of precision

for two months in the summer of 1968 the 
student movement gained momentum mexico liberty they 
shouted on oct 2 army machine guns silenced them 10 days before 
the citys olympic games 
that night the night of tlatelolco was one of the bloodiest 
ends to the protests that shook the world in 1968 officials put 
the death toll at 29 but students said hundreds were killed 
the movement withered and seemed to die but 20 years later 
festering discontent with a political system governed by a single 
party reemerged in an unprecedented vote against the stilldominant 
institutional revolutionary party or pri 
at the very high price of lives of blood of prison for many 
people the 68 movement opened a democratic channel that kept 
swelling until it overflowed in 1988 said gilberto guevara one 
of the principal leaders of the movement 
in the july 1988 general elections the opposition made 
unprecedented gains in parliament against the pri in power since 
1929 
mexico in 1968 was still in its miracle years of economic 
expansion the authoritarian government dominated unions campesino 
organizations and the press 
despite the growth distances between the classes also were 
growing and that wasnt the heritage expected of a government that 
said it came from a revolution said lorenzo meyer a leading 
political analyst who teaches at columbia university 
on july 26 two student marches one commemorating the cuban 
revolution merged and headed toward zocalo plaza site of the 
national palace and the metropolitan cathedral police blocked them 
and the clash lasted several hours 
in the weeks that followed students battled police with 
slingshotlaunched rocks and molotov cocktails police countered 
with clubs guns and fixed bayonets soldiers fired a bazooka to 
break down the door of one high school 
more than 250000 students went on strike demands emerged 
elimination of riot police firing of the police chief freedom for 
political prisoners and abolition of a law on political crimes 
the students also called for fundamental changes democracy 
political participation respect for basic freedoms and began 
directly attacking president gustavo diaz ordaz 
the army occupied the national university site of the 1968 
olympic stadium in violation of its autonomy with the oct 12 
opening of the games approaching it pulled out on sept 30 
on oct 2 more than 6000 students rallied in the plaza of the 
three cultures known as tlatelolco 
as the demonstration began there was the whump of a mortar and 
red and green flares flashed 
there was an infernal shooting said guevara who was on a 
fourthfloor balcony with other student leaders bullets 
bullets bullets until suddenly a tank began to fire at the 
building the building caught fire 
the official death toll was 29 students placed it at 200 to 
300 only two were soldiers many of the casualties were people in 
apartments or stores 
about 300 people including guevara alvarez and other leaders 
were jailed for 2 years 
the students never gained significant support from labor or 
peasants but when the problems they pointed out werent corrected 
other sectors joined their criticisms 
its 20 years later through the electoral process when 
everything explodes again now without violence but in a much more 
massive way alvarez said the great contribution of 68 was to 
show that political activity was respectable and necessary 
indeed sunday more than 100000 people chanting dont forget 
oct 2 filled the plaza of the three cultures to commemorate the 
student movement 
the meeting also was a rally in support of the left which has 
numerous leaders from the 68 movement and has the backing of the 
current national university student organization 
raising their arms in clenched fists or v for victory they 
yelled death to the pri 
this is a reencounter of the revolutionary democratic 
progressive forces to tell presidentelect carlos salinas de 
gortari and president miguel de la madrid that this nation is not 
going to continue tolerating imposition said heberto castillo a 
leader of teachers who supported the students in 1968 
castillo ran for president for the mexican socialist party then 
withdrew in favor of cuauhtemoc cardenas 
68 marked our lives and determined our destinies guevara 
said all those from 68 took on themselves an enormous burden of 
responsibilities politics took deep roots in us in a sense 
of commitment commitment to construction of democracy commitment 
to the people to the poor 68 is almost a religion an ethic

aboriginal elders today invoked tribal 
laws to protect a crocodile that killed a member of their tribe 
telling police to stop hunting the reptile because it is sacred 
police reported that aboriginal clans were holding a tribal 
meeting to decide what to do after a 25yearold aborigine of the 
gumatj tribe in the northern territory was found bitten in half at 
a pond 
the victim was not identified but was believed to have been 
snatched while camping alone 10 miles from the mouth of the cato 
river an autopsy was to be carried out in darwin after the upper 
half of his body was found sunday 
police wanted to search for the rest of his body by shooting 
saltwater crocodiles that inhabit the cato river of arnhem land 
near where the attack took place 
but aboriginal elders today gave police strict instructions not 
to shoot or even approach any crocodile they suspect is responsible 
until a decision is made 
saltwater crocodiles are found across northern australia the 
reptiles were declared a protected species in 1974 when they were 
threatened with extinction because of indiscriminate hunting for 
their skins conservationists now note that crocodiles which have 
no natural predators have grown in size and have lost their fear 
of man 
at least 11 people have been killed by crocodiles in the past 
two years 
brian walsh the northern territory conservation commissions 
chief wildlife officer said local aborigines regard crocodiles as 
sacred 
you have to realize that in east arnhem land the crocodile is 
of totemic significance and is very important to the culture so 
they wont make any decision until they have all sat down and had a 
meeting about it he said

americans overwhelmingly believe the federal 
government is rife with corruption with seven in 10 saying they 
think illegal payoffs are common a media generalassociated press 
poll has found 
on specific cases a plurality in the national poll said former 
attorney general edwin meese iii should have been charged with 
crimes and half opposed a presidential pardon for the highest 
official charged in the irancontra case former national security 
adviser john m poindexter 
respondents were evenly split on a pardon for poindexters 
assistant former marine lt col oliver north 
more fundamentally the poll of 1125 adults found deep 
skepticism of the federal governments integrity just 40 percent 
thought of the government as honest overall while 50 percent said 
not the rest didnt know 
an even greater share 69 percent said the federal government 
was poorly managed and more still 82 percent said they were not 
surprised to learn of recent allegations of payoffs in the awarding 
of pentagon contracts 
but the polls most critical finding was the broad belief that 
corruption pervades the federal government seventy percent said 
they thought that taking illegal payoffs for special favors was 
widespread 
that belief carried for majorities of all demographic groups 
from a low of 60 percent of republicans to a high of 82 percent of 
liberals overall just 20 percent of respondents did not believe 
payoffs were widespread 
the reagan administration however did not carry heavy blame 
for the concern over ethics while 43 percent said the 
administration had done a bad job of enforcing ethical standards in 
government 40 percent said it had done a good job that was within 
the polls threepoint margin of error 
there were other signs of good will toward the reagan 
administration fiftyone percent said it had done a good job of 
managing the government even though most said the government was 
poorly managed overall and 55 percent did not blame the 
administration for the pentagon scandal 
in the irancontra case vice president george bush has said he 
hopes for an acquittal of north who with poindexter is accused of 
conspiring to sell arms to iran in exchange for american hostages 
and to divert the proceeds to the nicaraguan rebels the trial will

the dollar weakened against the japanese yen on the 
tokyo foreign exchange market today while share prices slumped on 
the tokyo stock exchange 
after opening at 13378 yen the dollar moved in a narrow range 
of 1337213395 yen in light trading before closing at 13390 
down 040 yen from last fridays close of 13430 yen 
the nikkei stock average of 225 selected issues the most widely 
followed barometer on the exchange lost 15460 points or 056 
percent from last saturdays close to end the days trading at 
2754553 
volume traded on the first section of the exchange where most 
major shares are listed slackened to 650 million shares compared 
to 1 billion last friday 
exchange dealers said the weaker dollar reflects the poor 
showing of the currency in overseas markets 
it opened lower than last weeks level but there were no new 
incentives to push down the dollar further said an exchange 
dealer at a major japanese bank 
insurance firms and institutional investors would start buying 
the dollar if it declined to the mid to lower 133yen level 
anyway so i dont expect it to go down too much further than where 
it is now for a while said the trader speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
securities dealers attributed the sluggishness in share prices 
and trading volume to a lack of fresh incentives in the market 
the market environments are not necessarily poor said a 
dealer at a major securities firm referring to stable exchange 
rates and the strong performance of the world economy but the 
market had no direction this morning 
they also said news of emperor hirohitos weakening condition 
last saturday is affecting the market negatively 
its been a pattern that share prices slump every time we hear 
about a worsening in the condition of his majesty the emperor 
said a broker at a major securities firm

discoverys five astronauts headed 
back to earth today after a remarkably smooth fourday flight that 
kept their pledge to the challenger crew and resumed the 
journey of americans into space 
the shuttle travelers were on course to ignite reentry rockets 
for a fiery hourlong dash through the atmosphere touchdown was 
scheduled for 1237 pm edt on a dry lakebed at edwards air force 
base in californias mojave desert 
the astronauts were awakened shortly before 4 am edt with a 
parody of the beach boys song fun fun fun radioed up by 
mission control well have fun fun fun until we gotta put the 
shuttle away a musical group chorused 
like the beach discovery commander frederick h hauck told 
mission control that is outstanding outstanding thank you very 
much you do good work 
thousands of people were already gathered in the desert sunday 
to cheer their dramatic arrival and vice president george bush was 
expected to greet them the weather looked fine for a landing 
hauck and his crew were coming home from the first shuttle 
flight since the challenger explosion of jan 28 1986 and on 
sunday they poignantly remembered the five men and two women who 
died in that tragedy 
in an emotional message which they took turns reading hauck 
pilot richard o covey mission specialist george d nelson john 
m lounge and david c hilmers eulogized their fallen comrades as 
fellow sojourners and friends and expressed reverence for 
those whose sacrifice made our journey possible 
at this moment our place in the heavens makes us feel closer 
to them than ever before nelson said as the television screen 
showed the tail of discovery silhouetted against a striking view of 
earth 184 miles below 
lest we ever forgetthat to ascend to this seeming tranquil 
sea will always be fraught with danger let us remember the 
challenger crew whose voyage was so tragically short said covey 
today up here where the blue sky turns to black said 
hauck we can say at long last to dick mike judy to ron and 
el and to christa and greg 
dear friends we have resumed the journey that we promised to 
continue for you dear friends your loss has meant that we could 
confidently begin anew dear friends your spirit and your dreams 
are still alive in our heart 
the seven who died aboard challenger were richard scobee 
michael smith judith resnik ronald mcnair ellison onizuka 
gregory jarvis and schoolteacher christa mcauliffe 
following the memorial discoverys astronauts held a 20minute 
news conference from space while gathered in the middeck in front 
of a photograph of the challenger crew 
its good to be back to where they wanted to go so badly 
lounge commented 
replying to questions from reporters at the johnson space center 
in houston the crew expressed pleasure over discoverys 
performance and the results of the mission during which they 
released a 100 million communications satellite from the cargo bay 
and conducted a dozen science and technology experiments 
hauck had said before the flight that because more than 200 
modifications had been made flying discovery would be like testing 
a new spacecraft he said then he expected some equipment 
surprises but reported sunday the machine worked superbly 
with only a few minor glitches 
he said however there would be a discussion with the folks 
on the ground about the bulky uncomfortable spacesuits the 
astronauts have to wear on liftoff and landing to take advantage of 
a new escape system 
the experiments were wideranging from growing crystals in 
weightlessness to testing a laser beam communications system 
nelson said all exceeded my expectations in the way they have 
run 
lounge was asked what he would say to the two presidential 
candidates to convince them to support the space program he 
answered this way 
this is a very important flight simply because its the first 
step i would hope that all of the enthusiasm that weve seen 
throughout the country for this flight is sustained for the dozens 
and dozens of flights we have ahead of us if were going to make 
this program grow to the point that it needs to grow to to get us 
on the path to the future 
the shuttle redesign following challenger focused on the 
solidfuel booster rockets that caused the accident but extensive 
modifications also were made to the orbiting vehicle the main 
engines and the external fuel tank 
among changes to the orbiter were several to improve the 
performance of the brakes and steering system for landing with an 
eye toward eventually returning shuttles to earth on the concrete 
runway at the kennedy space center in florida just two miles from 
the shuttle launch pad 
landings in california add nearly 1 million to the cost of a 
shuttle mission and delay a spacecrafts return to flight because 
of time lost in having to ferry it back to the launch area bolted 
to the top of a boeing 747 jet 
only five of the 24 prechallenger missions ended in florida 
and each resulted in tire wear or damage because of problems with 
the brakes or steering system 
after discovery blew one tire and damaged another on the 16th 
mission in 1985 all subsequent landings were made on the wideopen 
dry lakebed at edwards 
the rogers commission that investigated the challenger accident 
recommended that all landings be scheduled for california until the 
new systems have proved themselves using the florida runway only 
in an emergency 
design improvements included strengthening the main landing gear 
axles changing the electronics to equalize pressure put on the 
brakes and changing the brake pad material for better performance

here is a transcript of the tribute 
by the discovery astronauts sunday to the crew of space shuttle 
challenger nasa said the astronauts wrote the statement 
themeselves and took turns reading it 
david c hilmers 
wed like to take just a few moments today to share with you 
some of the sights that weve been so privileged to view over the 
past several days 
as we watch along with you many emotions well up in our hearts 
joy for americas return to space gratitude for our nations 
support through difficult times thanksgiving for the safety of our 
crew reverence for those whose sacrifice made our journey possible 
john m lounge 
gazing outside we can understand why mankind has looked toward 
the heavens with awe and wonder since the dawn of human existence 
we can comprehend why our countrymen have been driven to explore 
the vast expanse of space and we are convinced that this is the 
road to the future the road that americans must travel if we are 
to maintain the dream of our constitution to secure the blessings 
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity 
richard o covey 
as we the crew of discovery witness this earthly splendor from 
americas spacecraft less than 200 miles separates us from the 
remainder of mankind in a fraction of a second our words reach 
your ears but lest we ever forget that these few miles represent a 
great gulf that to ascend to this seemingly tranquil sea will 
always be fraught with danger let us remember the challenger crew 
whose voyage was so tragically short 
george c nelson 
with them we shared a common purpose with them we shared a 
common goal at this moment our place in the heavens makes us feel 
closer to them than ever before 
those on the challenger who had flown before and seen these 
sights they would know the meaning of our thoughts those who had 
gone to view them for the first time they would know why we set 
forth 
they were our fellow sojourners they were our friends 
frederick h hauck 
today up here where the blue sky turns to black we can say at 
long last to dick mike judy to ron and el and to christa and 
greg dear friends we have resumed the journey that we promised to 
continue for you dear friends your loss has meant that we could 
confidently begin anew dear friends your spirit and your dreams

the leader of burmas strongest rebel 
group today appealed for international aid for the students who 
have fled to his bases seeking military training to topple the 
countrys authoritarian government 
hundreds of students some of whom had led recent 
antigovernment demonstrations in burma gathered on a large open 
field at this karen camp as gen bo mya spoke to thai and foreign 
correspondents 
some burmese buddhist monks were also present 
bo mya said the karens would allow the students to set up 
independently run camps where the rebels would provide military 
training and arm the students for a war against the militaryrun 
government in rangoon 
two small groups of students reportedly have already been given 
rudimentary training and have slipped back into rangoon where 
hardline gen saw maung staged a military coup sept 18 and 
ruthlessly put down prodemocracy protests 
now the students are urgently in need of international 
assistance for the success of their movement said a statement 
from the karen national union 
he said his rebel group presumed the international community 
realized the rebels had insufficient weapons and ammunition of its 
own 
bo mya said he has received no response to letters sent to the 
united states japan great britain and other governments 
describing brutal conditions in burma and urging them to halt all 
aid to rangoon 
the rebels who have fought the central government for four 
decades said nearly 3500 people had sought refuge in 
karencontrolled areas along the thaiburmese border including 
1545 at his base about one mile from the thai frontier 
the persecution killing and hostile searches are still going 
on in rangoon and other cities we believe many more will be 
coming bo mya said 
by official count about 425 persons have been killed since the 
sept 18 coup western diplomats and opposition figures say 
casualties were far higher while several thousand are reliably 
believe to have died as the military put down earlier 
demonstrations 
student leader winn moe who also appealed for foreign aid said 
the students expected many more colleagues to join them once 
independent functioning camps were set up 
we will try our best to see that they students will have the 
best privileges we can offer but we are not rich revolutionaries 
and we do not have enough ourselves bo mya said 
karen spokesman em marta said some problems had already surfaced 
among the students who have formed an all burma federation of 
student unions these included leadership disputes and factionalism 
they are young enthusiastic and very impatient we cannot 
fight our enemy with that em marta said 
this base is located 43 miles south of the key thai border town 
of mae sot and several days walk from rangoon to the west 
the karens rose up against the central government in 1949 saying 
that earlier promises of considerable autonomy had been broken 
since then a dozen ethnic minority groups have also taken uy arms 
against rangoon and together control large areas along the 
thaiburmese border 
ten of the rebel groups including the karens are banded 
together in a loose national democratic front which claims to 
field 35000 guerrillas the karen national union says it has 
17000 soldiers who are widely regarded as good jungle fighters

the 1989 springsummer readytowear shows 
have gotten off to a young start with giorgio armanis trendy 
emporio girls and the romantic maidens of romeo gigli 
both designers used teenage models sunday to underline the 
youthful look of their collections but whereas giglis girls 
looked like they walked out of a degas ballet scene the armani 
kids wore jeans and sweatshirts with slogans and designs printed 
everywhere 
the emporio line was invented several years ago by italian 
readytowear genius giorgio armani to satisfy the needs of the 
younger set in both style and pocketbook but it does not exclude 
those who are merely young at heart 
there are plenty of neat cotton pant suits with small jackets 
and loose trousers long skirts demure blouses and standby 
blazers to enhance an older womans town and country wardrobe too 
slogans and designs on clothing are the big thing among italian 
youth these days and armani picked up on this trend the phrase 
100 percent summer can be read on tshirts blouses and even 
earrings 
animals are a favorite design with llamas and elephants 
stitched painted or pinned on shirts pants and jackets 
the choice of animals reflects the folklore inspiration of the 
collection armani draws on india for his saritype skirts 
superloose pants and glittery beaded jackets while from peru he 
borrows geometric designs and bright colors as well as the popular 
indian flattopped bowler hat 
bright shades always seem a strain for armani used to the muted 
tones of his native industrial milan and when not involved in 
folklore fantasy he reverts to his standard beiges grays and navy 
blues 
except for a few micromini tube dresses and some very short 
shorts armani pulls his hemlines right down to the ankle for next 
summer 
whereas the lengthened hemline at armani marks a change from 
last seasons mini the look at gigli is long and drab as per usual 
his jackets in cotton jersey or linen had that old thriftshop 
look oversized with maddeningly long sleeves that always looked 
like they needed hemming 
pants were trim and vaguely tailored the most modern item in 
the collection 
the newest look at giglis is the knot with which he tied 
together hemlines bodices and waistlines aside from enhancing the 
orphan annie look of the collection with makedo mending the gigli 
knot could become the latest rage in geometric puzzles in fact it 
takes either a genius or a good set of instructions to figure out 
where and how to tie them 
the five day semiannual milan readytowear shows will end 
thursday and will include the new springsummer collections of 
such fashion favorites as ferre krizia versace and missoni in 
addition to italys numero uno armani

according to a newspaper report 
two guerrillas armed with guns and explosives were detained 
outside the heavily guarded downtown embassy at about noon 
saturday deputy interior minister agustin mantilla said he was 
quoted sunday in the daily el comercio perus leading newspaper 
there were no reported injuries during the arrests 
mantilla head of perus antisubversion effort would not 
identify the guerrilla group involved the embassy and its 
installations have been the targets of more than a dozen attacks in 
the past decade by leftist guerrillas who accuse the united states 
of conducting imperialistic policies toward peru 
mantilla told el comercio the guerrillas planned to attack the 
walled halfblock embassy complex with several accomplices who 
escaped the newspaper did not provide further details 
us embassy spokesman charles loveridge told the associated

the summer olympics will be remembered 
for moments of glory like that enjoyed by us diver greg louganis 
and the startling moment of disgrace when the gold was stripped 
from canadian sprinter ben johnson 
the soviet union won the first ussoviet olympic medal contest 
since 1976 getting 55 gold medals to 37 for east germany and 36 
for the united states host south korea rose to fourth in the world 
with 12 golds 
the fear of terrorism and massive civil unrest prompted 
extraordinary security but neither bogey materialized as nearly 
10000 athletes from 160 countries tested their mettle in 16 days 
of competition ended sunday 
as always there were shining moments of glory from an opening 
ceremony with exotic dancers and parachutists to a closing with 
hugs and tears fireworks and dances and the mascots of seoul and 
barcelona the site of the 1992 games floating together into the 
starry night 
louganis claimed his second pair of gold medals after hitting 
his head on a springboard he said he talked with his coach about 
quitting the olympics after hitting the board and opening a cut 
that needed five stitches to close 
we walked and discussed all the things we had gone through to 
get there he said i decided to stay in and im glad i did 
louganis said sunday he is retiring from diving to begin an 
acting career 
what had been the highest moment of the games ben johnson 
rocketing to victory over us great carl lewis in a 100meter dash 
world record led to the deepest pain when the canadian was caught 
cheating with musclebuilding anabolic steroids 
twenty years from now when most of the records set in seoul are 
broken the impact of johnsons disgrace will still be felt if 
athletes and trainers heed the events here and end doping 
there have been high points and some low points and the most 
important low point was ben johnson juan antonio samaranch 
president of the international olympic committee said today 
that was indeed a blow 
but catching johnson and expelling him and nine other athletes 
with positive drug tests was an indication that we have won the 
battle against doping samaranch said 
sports officials from the united states and the soviet union on 
sunday announced sunday they would join forces to work towards the 
elimination of drugs from sport 
a statement issued by the us and soviet olympic committees 
said the groups would investigate using the exchange of testing 
teams lab results and technical data education programs and 
uniform penalties 
for the united states a serious problem at the seoul games was 
a rising tide of antiamerican sentiment 
it was exacerbated by nbcs coverage which the koreans saw as 
antikorean and insensitive to local culture the arrest of several 
american athletes and the perceived rudeness of the us team at 
the opening ceremony 
the soviets meanwhile cultivated friendship by bringing in the 
bolshoi ballet the moscow philharmonic films a photo exhibit and 
copies of the communist party newspaper pravda 
the announcement of an unprecedented sports exchange program 
between south korea and the soviet union and the arrival of the 
first soviet diplomats since world war ii also warmed relations 
soviet athletes as they did in calgary canada during the 
winter games made a special effort to meet with local people 
american athletes tended to isolate themselves 
all those differences became apparent at the sporting events 
where koreans often cheered louder for the soviets or east germans 
than they did for americans despite a close 40year relationship 
with the united states 
still there were louganis and other americans to unabashedly 
cheer for like sistersinlaw florence griffith joyner and jackie 
joynerkersee who led an assault on the track and field record 
books and louganis 
griffith joyner won golds in the 100 the 200 and the 400meter 
relay and silver in the 1600meter relay she set a world record 
in the 200 and an olympic record in the 100 joynerkersee won two 
golds taking the heptathlon with a world record 7291 points and 
the long jump with an olympic mark of 24 feet 3 inches

a brooklyn teenager says hell do his homework 
a little more often now that space shuttle discoverys 
commander has read one of his assignments in space 
philip j morgan wrote a letter to shuttle commander frederick 
h hauck last may as an assignment for his eighthgrade science 
class at st marks catholic school 
i am a worried 14yearold that is worried about the future 
he wrote i feel that some of americas future is riding on you 
and your crews shoulders i give you all the inspiration i can 
give you because your ride this fall means so much to me 
hauck interrupted the crews schedule saturday to read the 
letter he said he hoped it would show young people that we are 
back on track and we have a lot of technological benefits that will 
come in the future 
interviewed sunday after he came in from playing football with 
friends morgan known as pj said hauck had eased his fears 
a lot but he is still worried because there are always 
risks in any space mission 
morgans teacher john d santoro said he gave the assignment 
as a way of introducing current events into the science class of 
85 letters morgans was the only one to draw such a personal 
response santoro said other students received autographed 
pictures from the astronauts they wrote 
i thought the fact they had gotten pictures was great 
santoro said but when he read the letter yesterday this was 
unreal 
hauck called morgan last week and said he might read the letter 
from space 
i didnt think hed really read it i didnt think there would 
be enough time the youngster said 
morgan said he was surprised at the attention his letter has 
attracted it was meant as a homework assignment i didnt even 
imagine it would go this far

the issue was until recently a humanitarian one with political 
dimensions fadlallah was quoted as saying now it has become 
wholly political so a discussion of it necessarily implies a 
discussion of relations between the states involved and the 
kidnappers he did not elaborate 
fadlallah was responding to a question about reports that 
american hostages will be released soon and that the kidnappers of 
anglican church envoy terry waite were awaiting specific responses 
from the british government 
the christiancontrolled local news agency almarkazia on sunday 
issued advance excerpts of the fadlallah interview with monday 
morning the broadcast quoted fadlallah as saying that the hostage 
ordeal was nearing its end 
when the hostage question shifts to highlevel talks between 
big powers and they start speaking of deadlines that means the 
question is nearing its end fadlallah was quoted as saying 
that quote did not appear in the interview published by the 
magazine and there was no explanation for the discrepency 
in jerusalem the editor of an israeli newspaper said sunday 
that negotiators for the united states and iran were holding talks 
near geneva on the release of eight amercan hostages and one 
british hostage 
hesh kestin managing editor of the nation newspaper said the 
talks included delegations representing iran and the united states 
and a mixed group of intermediaries he did not elaborate 
the nation an englishlanguage weekly that began publication a 
month ago reported friday that the united states has struck a 
secret deal with iran promising economic aid and arms sales in 
exchange for the release of eight of the nine american hostages in 
lebanon 
it said the deal would include the release of frozen iranian 
assets in us banks and the resumption of diplomatic relations 
president reagan white house officials and the state department 
all denied the report 
according to the nation which quoted unidentified sources in 
geneva iran would secure the release of five american hostages on 
or around oct 7 a second group of hostages including three 
americans and a briton possibly waite would be released a week 
later the report said 
all are believed held by shiite moslem groups loyal to iran 
the newspaper report said the us put aside its demand that 
tehran release marine lt col william higgins one of the nine 
americans because officials were convinced iran does not control 
the kidnappers holding him 
seventeen foreign hostages are held in lebanon the hostage held 
longest is terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press who was kidnapped march 16 1985 
waite disappeared in beirut on jan 20 1987 while trying to

auto tycoon henry ford ii who 
coveted his privacy in life has had his affairs dragged into 
public view in death 
bickering over his 350 million trust between fords third wife 
kathleen duross ford and the rest of the ford family boiled over 
in a public courtroom last week with more than a dozen lawyers and 
a horde of reporters present 
mrs fords lawsuit against her stepson edsel b ford ii tried 
to block the appointment of a new trustee although a lastminute 
settlement was all but approved last week the ordeal left its mark 
on the ford clan 
i dont think there can be a victory in a case like this for 
anybody said george kemsley an attorney for edsel ford henry 
ford desired privacy and that wish for privacy was disregarded 
consequently i think everybody lost 
by the standards of palm beach where manicured hedgerows and 
private guards keep unwanted eyes from intruding on the affairs of 
wealthy residents the publicity was especially disturbing 
everything my father did in life he did very quietly and very 
unassumingly edsel ford told the associated press his 
business life is a matter of record but his family life was 
something he cherished a great deal he was a very private man 
henry ford ii took control of ford motor co in 1945 from his 
dying grandfather auto pioneer henry ford at age 28 he cut 
unprofitable divisions and hired new managers making daily 
decisions that built the family company into a worldwide auto 
empire 
he divorced his second wife christina in 1980 and married 
kathleen a 40yearold former model in carson city nev none of 
his children attended the wedding 
before he died of pneumonia at 70 a year ago ford named 
kathleen sole beneficiary of the trust until her death when the 
money would pass on to his six grandchildren 
he named three trustees kathleen son edsel and lawyer martin 
citrin the husband of one of mrs fords close friends 
but in april citrin committed suicide and the trouble began 
fords handpicked alternate trustee william donaldson asked 
for a 1 million annual fee edsel ford said donaldson a former 
undersecretary of state and founder of the yale school of 
organization and management was worth it mrs ford called it 
extortion and sued to block donaldsons appointment 
she claimed in a court deposition that edsel ford and donaldson 
threatened to reduce her income from the trust to the minimum 15 
million spelled out in the will a charge edsel ford vehemently 
denied 
he also denied any animosity existed between his stepmother and 
the rest of the family 
this illwill thing is strictly a function of 
sensationalism said the son of fords first wife anne who 
remains uninvolved in the trust dispute 
attorneys narrowly avoided an open court battle by agreeing to 
settle the lawsuit hours before a hearing early last week in palm 
beach county circuit judge vaughn rudnicks courtroom 
but before rudnick could approve the settlement lawyers for the 
grandchildren balked demanding that a legal guardian be found to 
ensure their clients get their share of the trust 
retired circuit court judge robert hewlitt called by some the 
gentleman judge of palm beach county was appointed and is 
reviewing the settlement 
if hewlitt and rudnick approve it only one obstacle will keep 
the familys finances in the public eye christina fords 54 
million alimony claim against the estate a motion to dismiss her 
claim was rejected wednesday by yet another palm beach county judge

concern about official wrongdoing in vermont 
was once so minimal that from the 1930s to the 1960s a statehouse 
window was kept open for officials and others whod forgotten their 
keys 
then came the bennington school scandal 
as far as i can tell never in the states history has there 
been something of magnitude said state archivist gregory 
sanford the cases have always involved an individual not a 
network 
so far it has led to four convictions including the school 
districts treasurer and a school board member numerous 
resignations and the decertification of six educators 
at the center is george sleeman who served for 13 years as 
superintendent of the southwest vermont supervisory union the 
states largest school union 
he faces four trials the first of which began last week in 
all he is accused of 37 counts of embezzlement and perjury 
his reign is compared to those of the old ward bosses in big 
cities outside vermont who managed to get dead people to vote on 
election day sleeman is accused of running classes that never met 
and had at least one dead person as a student 
george sleeman took money for his own purposes money that was 
in his care because he had the trust of the people who put him in 
that position money that was intended to go to help in the 
education of children state prosecutor david suntag told jurors 
as sleeman went on trial for nine of 37 counts of embezzlement and 
perjury 
the issue in the first trial is whether sleeman improperly paid 
himself 8000 from school funds for increased rent on an office 
sleemans lawyer william sessions said sleeman believed he was 
authorized to receive the increased rent he blamed the problems on 
poor bookkeeping 
there were no rules no regulations nothing on how accounting 
should be sessions said as he described one of the accounts 
sleeman suspended in 1985 has refused comment on any of the 
charges against him 
but the rent checks form a small part of the school scandal 
which began june 7 1984 with the announcement the school system 
had a deficit of 17 million 
as auditors and investigators began looking into the deficit 
offices were burglarized and financial records disappeared 
a breakin at sleemans office in which crucial records were 
taken was not a burglary but an attempt to make us believe it 
was a burglary a bennington police detective said 
auditors said sleeman ran a shell game using about 140 bank 
accounts for a school system that typically would have 10 
the alleged corruption included bidding practices which some 
said were rigged to favor sleemans friends and the food service 
program 
the food service programs former director donat ratelle said 
he wrote checks to sleeman because he told him to 
you dont question the superintendent ratelle said 
asked why he said you dont know george sleeman 
george searched for power to be a ward boss said richard 
chapman who served as interim superintendent following sleemans 
suspension 
sleeman oversaw 4400 students 350 teachers two dozen 
administrators and at annual budget of 20 million 
in this community what george said it came as authority if 
you didnt agree with him he could do something to you chapman 
said

generoso pope jr who built an empire on 
the national enquirers splashy brand of journalism was remembered 
fondly by employees after his death of a heart attack at his 
beachfront home he was 61 
he was the paper enquirer managing editor nat chrnaz said 
its shattering it really is 
pope was taken to john f kennedy medical center on sunday 
where he was pronounced dead said hospital spokesman larry 
schwingle 
pope had a fortune estimated at more than 150 million by forbes 
magazine 
known as a tough boss he pushed his highly paid reporters 
many from britains fleet street to keep cranking out what 
inquiring minds want to know 
he was not a person who was isolated in an ivory tower said 
enquirer reporter roger capettini the man rarely if ever took 
vacations he was involved in every aspect of the enquirer i think 
mr pope was a creative genius 
its a very sad occasion capettini said he truly was 
loved by his employees he demanded a lot of us but he rewarded 
and compensated us 
while the enquirer flourished its style has many critics and 
several celebrities have sued the publication among them were 
carol burnett who sued for libel in 1981 and won 800000 frank 
sinatra cary grant and actress shirley jones all settled out of 
court 
pope was a native of new york city and his father was the 
founder of the italianlanguage daily il progresso 
the younger pope graduated from the massachusetts institute of 
technology at 19 and at age 25 bought the struggling new york 
enquirer with 75000 he borrowed 
i took over then discovered the paper was about a week away 
from bankruptcy pope said in a december 1985 interview there 
was just one employee and me it took six years before we finally 
broke even in 1958 
by changing the papers format and adopting its glitzy style 
he turned it into the bestread supermarket tabloid with a 
circulation of 45 million 
pope said the paper evolved when i discovered that gore would 
sell gory pictures gory stories he later shifted the focus 
towards celebrity news and gossip health tips and the bizarre his 
more sensational weekly world news has another 11 million readers 
in 1971 pope brought his newspaper to lantana a coastal town 
of 10000 about nine miles south of palm beach he put up and 
decorated a 126foot fir tree a christmas tradition ever since 
the tree draws thousands of people each year 
pope lantanas largest employer was known for his generosity 
to the community he recently endowed the town with a rescue 
vehicle and was on the board of trustees for the hospital where he 
died 
pope who has six children was married three times his widow 
and wife of 29 years is lois pope

the fate of three haitian soldiers who forced 
their way onto a new yorkbound jet in haiti will depend largely on 
whether they were victims or victimizers in their caribbean 
country a human rights official says 
the question is are they worthy of refugee protection 
are they merely fugitives from justice or are they refugees from 
persecution said arthur helton director of the political asylum 
committee of the lawyers for human rights 
the three soldiers were arrested saturday when american airlines 
flight 658 arrived at kennedy airport 
they boarded the plane in the haitian capital of portauprince 
armed with rifles and seeking political asylum but the pilot 
persuaded them to surrender their weapons 15 minutes into the 
flight and none of the 233 people on board was hurt 
the soldiers were to be arraigned today in us district court 
on charges of air piracy the trio identified by port authority 
of new york and new jersey police as edouine noel 24 nicolas 
normil 23 and jean charleston bienaime 23 could face 
deportation or long us prison terms authorities said sunday 
no information has been made public that would answer heltons 
questions the fbi the us customs service and the us 
attorneys office were unable to provide any details sunday about 
the mens motives or background 
as one of the soldiers was being led away in handcuffs at the 
airport saturday night he called out to reporters that he fled 
haiti because of division a larmee french for strife in the 
army he and his two comrades were still dressed in their 
olivegreen military uniforms and black boots as authorities took 
them away 
a port authority detective said saturday night that the men 
expressed concern about a communist takeover of haiti though 
none of the turmoil in haiti in recent weeks has been generally 
attributed to communists 
lt gen prosper avril was installed as president sept 17 
following a coup by lowerranking soldiers that led to the ouster 
of lt gen henri namphy the coup triggered a military uprising 
that led to the ouster of military commanders loyal to namphy and 
the duvalier family dictatorship that preceded him 
assistant us attorney johnny frank said the three soldiers 
could face maximum sentences of 20 years to life in prison if they 
are tried and convicted of air piracy 
the men can expect to be tried before their application for 
political asylum is considered helton said he said the request 
for asylum could be granted even if the men are convicted assuming 
they can prove that they acted out of desperation 
but if the men are shown to have been perpetrators of violence 
in haiti they could be deported following their conviction helton 
said 
another possibility is that the haitian government would seek to 
extradite the men he said such a request would be considered 
before a trial was held in the united states

an amusement ride that had passed 
inspection only days earlier was stopped in the middle of a loop by 
a broken coupling stranding 20 people upside down for more than an 
hour according to a state official 
at least 12 people were treated at hospitals for dizziness and 
other minor problems after the super loops ride at the bloomsburg 
fair malfunctioned saturday night authorities said 
they were up there upside down waving their arms just 
hanging there said fairgoer vince vangroski of hazleton they 
started to panic a little bit being upside down for that period of 
time is scary 
neil cashman director of the states bureau of amusement rides 
said the ride had been passed by state inspectors tuesday after a 
wornout wheel discovered by the ride owners inspectors was 
replaced 
everything was right up to par he said 
the rides cars run inside a single large vertical loop and are 
attached to and pulled along by a flexible inner loop he said the 
broken coupling attached a car to the inner loop 
passengers are held in their seats by lap and safety bars a 
safety cage runs the entire length of the train 
rescue workers had to move the train slowly to the bottom of the 
loop to remove the passengers cashman said 
he said his office would contact the ride manufacturer lmc inc 
of texas to find out whether similar problems had been reported 
elsewhere he said he had not heard of any prior problems with the 
ride 
according to the states amusement ride inspection act rides 
must be checked every time they are set up it was passed by the 
state legislature in 1984 after several accidents occurred on 
traveling carnival rides 
cashman said a preliminary investigation does not indicate any 
wrongdoing 
a state police spokesman said about 100000 attended the 
agricultural exhibition and carnival saturday its last day the 
ride was dismantled early sunday morning

to the federal parliament controlled by the conservatives under the 
countrys first chancellor konrad adenauer 
his wife marianne died in a 1984 automobile accident

the cheers of parishioners catholic people must be consulted in 
all aspects of their lives and certainly on something as important 
as a change in their parish 
he said the proposal which dealt another blow to a decaying 
city is unjust and not a way to deal with people today 
he said he believes all 43 churches designated to close and the 
five that would merge with some of the closing churches will fight 
the directive which was announced wednesday by archbishop edmund 
szoka 
leaders of the affected churches will begin developing a 
strategy at a meeting tonight helinski said 
the plan which affects about 10000 roman catholics calls for 
st ignatius 150 families to merge with those at st davids 
about a mile away all of the churches are in detroit except for 
one in the suburb of river rouge 
the detroit archdiocese comprises 331 parishes in six counties 
with about 15 million members that figure is up from 900000 
after world war ii but most of that growth has been in the 
suburbs in 1976 more than 100000 catholic households were in 
detroit as against fewer than 50000 now 
helinski said he thinks the decision to close the churches is 
also related to the shortage of priests 
parishioners were upset that the decision appears to contradict 
what the church recently asked parishes to emphasize ministry to 
the poor sick and elderly 
the announcement followed four years of study of urban parishes 
by a task force which concluded that 43 of the citys 112 churches 
arent viable 
mark and beverly clark pattison members of the st ignatius 
church council charged that the task force never looked closely at 
the parish or gave it a fair chance to defend itself 
they dont understand what it means to ask people to cross 
three neighborhoods and a freeway to get to a catholic church 
mrs pattison said 
but kay federspiel secretary at st ignatius for 20 years 
before she moved from the neighborhood after her house was 
burglarized said she watched the church decline 
there used to be 1400 parishioners here now there are maybe 
300 she said you see what the neighborhood is like around 
here with the burnedout houses and you cant blame people for 
moving away

libya and chad after years of bitter fighting 
announced today they have restored diplomatic relations and said 
they will settle their territorial dispute in a responsible and 
understanding manner 
in a statement carried by the libyan news agency jana which 
said it was issued simultaneously in the capitals of libya chad 
and togo the two countries said they intended to establish 
relations of good neighborliness and cooperation 
diplomats from togo were reportedly instumental in bringing 
together libyas col moammar gadhafi and president hissene habre 
of chad long bitter enemies to restore ties 
in the statement chad and libya said they would respect the 
sept 11 1987 ceasefire that ended their fighting in the 
mountainous deserts of northern chad and deal with their regional 
disagreement in a peaceful way 
by the end of october chad will send an ambassador to tripoli 
and libya will open a peoples bureau as it calls its 
embassies in ndjamena the statement said 
habre ousted a libyanbacked government in 1982 but only 
succeeded in driving libyan troops out of most of the country early 
last year in a series of lightning attacks by chadian soldiers in 
light trucks 
the remaining territorial dispute concerns the aouzou strip a 
45000square mile band of land thought to be rich in uranium 
along the border between the two countries libya continues to 
occupy the strip which it contends was ceded by france to italy in 
1941 before chad and libya became independent 
libya had annexed the territory in 1973 
habres government received extensive french and american 
military aid for his battle with libya france sent several 
thousand troops equipped with antiaircraft weapons and jaguar and 
mirage warplanes to deter libyan attacks on southern chad 
especially ndjamena 
in paris the french government said in a statement it is 
pleased by this decision which will open an era of peace between 
the two countries 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement told reporters that 
france would consult with chad before withdrawing the french force 
now down to about 1200 men he noted that the french presence is 
not there to stay forever and could be reinforced very quickly 
from french bases in the neighboring central african republic in 
case of renewed threat 
chad has been wracked by war almost continuously since it became 
independent from france in 1960 when former rebel leader goukouni 
oueddei was president from 1980 to 1982 he invited the libyans 
into the country and they sent 7000 men gadhafi announced plans 
to merge the two countries 
habre ousted goukouni in 1982 sending him fleeing to the north 
the following year goukouni started a military drive on ndjamena 
after libyan troops became directly involved france sent in an 
intervention force and halted the advance 
president francois mitterrand of france and gadhafi signed a 
mutual troop withdrawal agreement in late 1984 and the french 
pulled out gadhafi reneged to mitterrands embarrassment and the 
french sent their troops back to chad

a congressional candidate accused of linking an 
airline and the aids epidemic became a man without a party when the 
colorado democratic party executive committee disowned him 
party officials voted 331 on sunday to deny john mitchell the 
use of the name democrat in his campaign after he failed to respond 
to allegations stemming from a lawsuit filed against him by trans 
world airlines 
the airline has accused mitchell a colorado springs teacher and 
real estate agent of distributing posters connecting twa with aids 
the party needed to deal with this openly dont flinch dont 
blush just do business and i think thats what weve done here 
said state democratic party chairman buie seawell 
mitchell did not attend sundays meeting and has not been 
available to talk with state party officials since the lawsuit was 
filed sept 19 in us district court at denver he failed to 
return calls to his home telephone answering recorder made sunday 
night by the associated press 
according to twas lawsuit which seeks 500000 in damages 
mitchell sent a poster to the airlines new york offices in july 
saying thousands of these have been sent around the country our 
staff is working on a new poster they will continue to be sent 
until twa corrects the hurt you have causedcost me 
the posters according to the lawsuit said aids is spread 
through twa todays twa means aids and twa travel with 
aids 
mitchell was unopposed for the nomination to run against 
incumbent republican rep joel hefley in a gopdominated district 
which encompasses the colorado springs area it was his first try 
at political office 
the 5th district democratic committee on sunday issued a 
complaint against mitchell that later was accepted by the executive 
committee and resulted in the partys disavowal of his candidacy 
the complaint said mitchells failure to respond to the 
controversy has hurt the campaigns of other democratic candidates 
in the district 
the partys vote wont affect the ballot itself which already 
has been printed only a court order could have gotten mitchells 
name off the ballot party officials said they preferred not to 
take such a measure 
rick daily the partys attorney said the party wasnt making a 
judgment on twas allegations against mitchell but was moving 
against him only because of mr mitchells failure to act like a 
responsible candidate and step forward and deal with those issues 
mitchells squabble with twa apparently began in 1983 when he 
took the airline to small claims court in two separate cases in 
colorado springs to recover frequent flyer benefits he believed 
he deserved 
mitchell won one case but lost the second one shortly 
afterward twa said it received posters and stickers anonymously 
connecting the airline with aids

soviet officials today capped the biggest shakeup 
in mikhail s gorbachevs 3 years in power by replacing politburo 
member vitaly i vorotnikov as premier of the russian republic 
the supreme soviet of the russian republic the largest of the 
15 soviet republics elected interior minister alexander v vlasov 
an ally of soviet leader mikhail gorbachev as the new premier 
vlasov was named a candidate member of the politburo during a 
central committee meeting friday 
the 62yearold vorotnikov was moved to the ceremonial job of 
president of russia vladimir p orlov the 67yearold president 
of the republic retired 
vlasov had been named a candidate member of the politburo during 
a central committee meeting on friday 
tass the soviet news agency said gorbachev recommended the 
changes 
the latest changes come after gorbachev led the most dramatic 
political changes in the soviet leadership of his 3 years in power 
todays meeting of the russian supreme soviet in the grand 
kremlin palace comes two days after the national parliament elected 
gorbachev the countrys president to replace 79yearold andrei a 
gromyko 
on friday gorbachev pushed a major shakeup through the 
communist partys policymaking central committee he retired two 
full and two candidate politburo members promoted four other 
people and streamlined the central committees apparatus 
vorotnikov and ukrainian communist party leader vladimir v 
shcherbitsky are the only two members of the ruling 12man party 
politburo who were there before gorbachev took power 
one western diplomat in moscow who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said vorotnikov was considered a swing vote on the 
politburo he generally supported gorbachevs reforms but was 
not real outspoken cautious not zealous the diplomat said 
vlasov had worked in gorbachevs home area of southern russia 
before becoming interior minister in charge of the police in 
1986 his replacement is to be named by national authorities 
vorotnikov was first deputy premier of the russian republic in 
19751979 but lost the support of the kremlin leadership in the 
last years of president leonid i brezhnev and was made ambassador 
to cuba he was summoned back to moscow after brezhnevs death in 
1982 and became premier of the republic the following year 
gorbachevs election saturday by the 1500 deputies of the 
national supreme soviet unified the party and gave him both the top 
government and party jobs and more power to force through his 
programs of reform 
gorbachev has advocated a more powerful presidency than the 
largely ceremonial job held by gromyko who was elevated to the job 
in july 1985 after serving 28 years as soviet foreign minister 
on friday gorbachev isolated yegor k ligachev widely thought 
to be the leading conservative on the politburo by placing him in 
charge of farm policy he also eliminated another member of the 
politburo old guard mikhail s solomentsev and retired candidate 
politburo members vladimir i dolgikh and pyotor n demichev 
fridays hastily called meeting of the policymaking central 
committee elevated economist vadim medvedev from the committees 
secretariat to full politburo status and streamlined the committee 
structure giving key gorbachev allies important responsibilities 
the politburo changes left the kremlin with no clear no 2 man 
a position that generally had been regarded as ligachevs

made at a politburo meeting sept 26 after which top officials on 
overseas trips were ordered back to moscow

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether displays of a christmas nativity scene and a menorah 
symbolizing the jewish holiday of chanukah should be allowed at 
two government buildings in pittsburgh 
the justices said they will review a ruling that each display 
violated the constitutionally required separation of church and 
state 
the american civil liberties union and several pittsburgh 
residents challenged the displays in a 1986 lawsuit 
since 1981 a nativity scene or creche depicting the birth of 
jesus christ has been displayed inside the main entrance to the 
allegheny county courthouse for about six weeks during the 
christmas season 
a block away an 18foot menorah has been displayed each year on 
the front steps of the citycounty building since 1982 
a federal trial judge refused to order the dismantling of the 
displays last christmas but the 3rd us circuit court of appeals 
ruled by a 21 vote last march 15 that the displays unlawfully 
promote religion 
the only reasonable conclusion is that by permitting the 
creche and the menorah to be placed at the buildings the city and 
county have tacitly endorsed christianity and judaism and have 
therefore acted to advance religion the appeals court ruled 
the creche is owned by the holy name society a roman catholic 
mens group the menorah a ninebranched candelabrum was donated 
by chabad a jewish organization 
the supreme court in 1984 allowed communities nationwide to 
include nativity scenes in officially sponsored holiday displays 
in that ruling the justices let pawtucket ri officials 
place a creche in a christmas display because such decorations as 
santa claus reindeer and snowmen also were included 
but lower courts since have treated the 1984 decision as a 
narrow one and have disallowed various christmas displays deemed 
too religious 
since a 1970 supreme court ruling courts have been using a 
threepart test to determine whether some government action 
violates churchstate separation 
a law or governmental practice is not a violation of religious 
freedoms if 
it has a secular or nonreligious purpose 
its primary effect neither advances nor inhibits religion 
it does not foster excessive governmental entanglement with 
religion 
the 3rd circuit court said the displays in pittsburgh advanced 
religion and therefore were unconstitutional 
in dissenting from the appeals court ruling judge joseph f 
weis jr said this aggressive neutrality will lead not to 
accommodation but to animosity not to tolerance of but to 
hostility toward religion 
the appeals court decision was appealed by allegheny county 
pittsburgh and chabad 
the cases are allegheny county vs aclu 872050 chabad vs 
aclu 8890 and pittsburgh vs aclu 8896

a zoo advocacy group is calling for an 
investigation into the cause of a halfdozen puncture wounds on the 
head and face of an elephant that injured a veterinarian who was 
trying to treat the wounds 
what were talking about here is abuse sandra keller 
spokeswoman for citizens for a better zoo said sunday we have 
been receiving complaints about the way these elephants are being 
mistreated for several months 
veterinarian gail hedberg was treating an abscess on the head of 
a 3ton asian elephant named tinkerbelle when the animal attacked 
her saturday fracturing her pelvis 
zookeepers said tinkerbelle did a handstand on the woman 
hedberg was listed in stable condition today at san francisco 
general hospital 
some officials defended practices at the san francisco zoo 
we have to use elephant hooks and other methods that may 
appear abusive because were not talking about puppy dogs and pussy 
cats here said zoo director saul kitchener how do you get a 
10000pound elephants attention 
elephant keeper michele radovsky said beating an elephant is no 
different from people taking rolled newspapers and hitting their 
dog 
but paul hunter a keeper at the zoo for nine years said the 
abscess on tinkerbells head was caused by someone hitting her too 
hard with a hooked instrument called an ankuf or elephant hook 
the elephants get beaten up real bad and im getting tired of 
it said hunter

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether the federal government may continue to bar newspapers from 
carrying advertisements for privately run lotteries and other games 
of chance 
the justices said they will study a minnesota newspaper 
association challenge to a postal law effectively prohibiting such 
advertising 
the court also said it will judge the validity of the postal 
laws effective ban on newspapers publishing lists of lottery 
winners 
a federal judge in minnesota last dec 31 upheld the ban on 
newspaper advertising but struck down as unconstitutional the ban 
on publishing lists of lottery winners 
the minnesota newspapers groups appeal said the ban on 
advertising violates freespeech rights 
in a separate appeal justice department lawyers asked the high 
court to reinstate the ban on publishing lists of lottery winners 
federal postal law contains an exemption for a stateconducted 
lottery published by a newspaper in that state or in an adjacent 
state 
the controvery acted on today focuses mainly on lotteries and 
other gaming such as bingo and raffles sponsored by nonprofit 
charitable organizations and others 
lawyers for the minnesota newspapers said the revenue 
generated by charitable gaming is very sustantial in minnesota 
alone it appears to exceed 200 million per year 
postal laws prohibit use of the mails to disseminate information 
about any lottery not run by a state since nearly all newspapers 
rely on the mail for at least a portion of their distribution the 
postal laws apply to them 
us district judge paul a magnuson upheld the ban on lottery 
advertisements even though he acknowledged that the ads are a 
constitutionally protected form of commercial speech 
he said congress has two substantial interests in the ban 
preserving the states power to prohibit or limit gambling within 
their borders and restricting the interstate growth of private 
lotteries to reduce the threat of organized criminal involvement 
but magnuson ruled that newspapers cannot be barred from running 
lists of private lottery winners unless such lists are found in 
advertisements 
lists of prizes awarded do not fit the definition of 
commercial speech a prize list also has value as news the judge 
said 
the cases are minnesota newspaper association vs postmaster 
general 871943 and frank vs minnesota newspaper association

the supreme court in a case that could bear 
on a wide range of federal fees and taxes today agreed to judge 
the validity of a 1986 federal law imposing user fees on 
pipeline companies 
the justices said they will hear a reagan administration 
challenge to an oklahoma court ruling that struck down the law a 
pipeline company that transports hazardous liquids had attacked the 
law as unconstitutional 
administration lawyers said a number of recently enacted user 
fees could be affected by the case 
they cited the authority of the nuclear regulatory commission to 
assess nuclear power plants for licensing and inspection and the 
authority of the federal energy regulatory commission to impose 
fees to finance its regulatory programs 
directly involved in the case acted on today are fees or taxes 
imposed on pipeline companies that transport hazardous waste and 
natural gas 
the government is seeking to collect about 85 million a year 
from the companies to pay for federal pipeline safety programs run 
by the department of transportation 
at issue is whether the assessments are fees or taxes and 
whether the law grants the secretary of transportation too much 
discretion in determining how much money the companies must pay 
us magistrate john leo wagner in tulsa okla ruled last year 
that the assessments are taxes and therefore the law improperly 
gives the transportation secretary power to set tax rates 
where no request for an agencys services is made and no 
specific benefit is conferred upon the one being assessed the 
assessment cannot be labeled a fee wagner said 
he added that the law gives the secretary so much discretion 
that the amount to be assessed each company could be almost any 
figure from zero to 100 percent of the entire cost of the safety 
program 
the assessments may be based on how many miles of pipeline a 
company operates the quantity of natural gas or liquid and how far 
it is shipped or the gross revenue of the company 
the law was challenged by midamerica pipeline co assessed 
53000 in 1986 
wagner said that depending on what formula the transportation 
department chose midamerica could be required to pay from 5 
percent to 283 percent of the 85 million total to be collected 
the case is burnley vs midamerica pipeline 872098

the supreme court setting the stage for an 
important antitrust ruling today agreed to decide whether states 
may sue in behalf of those indirectly affected by illegal 
pricefixing 
the court voted to hear an appeal by four states california 
minnesota alabama and arizona seeking to participate in a 
multimilliondollar settlement of a nationwide conspiracy to fix 
cement prices 
justices john paul stevens and sandra day oconnor disqualified 
themselves from the case without explaining why 
lower courts had dismissed the states efforts to sue for county 
and municipal governments that had purchased cement or products 
containing cement the states sought the tripledamages awards 
allowed under federal antitrust law 
in throwing out the states lawsuits a federal trial judge and 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals relied on a 1977 supreme 
court decision in it the justices said federal antitrust law does 
not permit indirect purchasers to sue 
under the 1977 ruling if a manufacturer illegally conspires to 
fix a products price and sells it to a retailer the retailer may 
sue for triple damages but if the retailer passes on the illegally 
inflated price when selling the product to the ultimate consumer 
the consumer may not use federal antitrust law to sue 
lawyers for the four states supported by the reagan 
administration say congress never intended federal antitrust law 
to negate state laws protecting indirect purchasers 
a spate of lawsuits were filed against cement manufacturers in 
1976 and 1977 alleging a nationwide conspiracy to fix prices each 
of the four states involved in todays court action filed a suit 
based in part on state laws protecting indirect purchasers 
state laws in california minnesota and alabama expressly give 
indirect purchasers the right to sue 
arizonas law could be interpreted to permit such suits 
the litigation was consolidated in federal court in arizona and 
by 1981 cement manufacturers had agreed to pay 32 million to 
settle the case 
direct purchasers then challenged the states right to be 
compensated for indirect purchases 
us district judge manuel l real dismissed the indirect 
purchasers claims in 1985 and the 9th circuit court upheld his 
dismissal last year 
reagan administration lawyers in supporting the ensuing supreme 
court appeal by the four states said two key federal antitrust 
laws contain no statement of congressional intent to preempt 
state antitrust remedies 
in these circumstances the administration lawyers argued 
there is no basis for a conclusion that federal antitrust law 
preempts state indirectpurchaser statutes 
they said at least 11 other states and the district of columbia 
have enacted laws expressly giving indirect purchasers the right to 
sue 
the states are colorado hawaii illinois kansas maryland 
michigan mississippi new mexico rhode island south dakota and 
wisconsin 
the case is california vs arc america corp 871862

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether communities may seek to protect young teenagers by barring 
anyone over 18 from dance halls or other establishments catering to 
minors 
the court said it will consider reinstating a dallas ordinance 
that licensed certain dance halls on the condition only teens 14 to 
18 and their parents or guardians be admitted as patrons 
a texas appeals court struck down the ordinance ruling that it 
unduly interferes with young peoples constitutionally protected 
right to associate with whom they please 
in urging the justices to reinstate the ordinance dallas 
officials said the potential harm comes from the association 
with persons who may influence the behavior of the children not 
only at the dance hall where supervision exists but also away from 
the dance hall 
but the state appeals court last oct 29 ruled that the age 
limit cannot be enforced 
a childs right of association may not be abridged simply on 
the premise that he might associate with those who would persuade 
him into bad habits such as illegal use of drugs or alcohol the 
state court said 
it added it is primarily the responsibility of the parent 
not the city to tell the minor how old his dance partner may be 
the answer lies in supervision not in strict segregation by age 
group 
there is no showing that the less restrictive means of 
supervision will be ineffectual to control the evil perceived in 
allowing say a 20yearold to enter the premises and peacably and 
consensually dance with a 14yearold the state court said 
the ordinance had been challenged by charles m stanglin who 
operates the twilight skating rink in dallas 
stanglin has a socalled class e dance hall license issued 
to those dance places catering to minors 
he divided the floor of his skating rink so that patrons dance 
or skate to the same music in full view of one another no alcohol 
is allowed inside 
the ordinance he challenged forbids anyone not between the ages 
of 14 and 18 except for parents or legal guardians of patrons to 
dance or even be on the premises 
the state court struck down the agesegregation portion of the 
dallas ordinance but upheld that portion imposing midnight curfew 
for such establishments

the supreme court today agreed to study the 
power of federal courts to decide some disputes in which a federal 
agency takes charge of a failing statechartered financial 
institution 
the justices said they will hear a reagan administration 
challenge to a ruling from illinois limiting federal court 
jurisdiction in cases involving the federal savings and loan 
insurance corp fslic 
justice department lawyers said the 7th us circuit court of 
appeals ruling could have serious consequences for the fslic under 
financial strains to insure deposits in failing thrift institutions 
the fslic and its parent agency the federal home loan bank 
board reported in september that they had added more than 12 
billion in outstanding debt since midaugust while shutting down 
merging or finding new owners for 46 insolvent savings insitutions 
at issue in the case acted on today was whether the fslic can 
sue in federal court when it seeks to collect money potentially 
hundreds of millions of dollars allegedly owed to the failing 
thrift institutions 
the 7th circuit court ruled in november 1987 that the federal 
courts lack authority when the alleged violations of federal law 
are subsidiary to related allegations of state law violations 
peals courts elsewhere have given broader 
authority to federal courts to decide such suits 
justice department lawyers said the 7th circuit court ruling 
could undermine efforts by the fslic to sue those who owe money to 
failing savings and loan institutions 
for example the governments appeal said it is now too late to 
sue the manning directors in illinois state courts because of that 
states statute of limitations 
the former directors urged the supreme court to reject the 
appeal

kwan fai mak convicted of 13 killings in what 
seattle prosecutors called the largest robberyrelated mass 
murder in american history lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court let stand rulings that mak received a fair trial and 
properly was sentenced to death 
mak and benjamin ng were convicted of murdering 13 patrons of a 
chinatown gambling club in seattle during a feb 18 1983 robbery 
prosecutors said mak planned and supervised the wah mee club 
massacre and that one of his objectives was to leave no 
witnesses 
all patrons and employees present in the club during the robbery 
were bound and in turn shot in the head from close range one 
patron 61yearold wai chin survived to testify against mak and 
ng 
the washington supreme court in upholding maks conviction and 
death sentence said his crime set a new gauge for cowardly 
murder in this state 
mak who emigrated from hong kong to seattle when he was 15 was 
21 when the crime was committed 
his appeal contended that the state supreme court wrongly failed 
to order an evidentiary hearing to determine whether mak was denied 
effective legal help

a new york city developer ordered to remove 
the top 12 floors of a 31story condominium building in manhattans 
fashionable upper east side lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment left intact a ruling that the 
buildings height must be reduced even if construction was 
permitted through a mistake by city officials 
the developer parkview associates said it will lose more than 
9 million if forced to remove the top 12 floors of the building 
located at the southeast corner of park avenue and 96th street 
the company bought the site in 1982 and received a construction 
permit from new york citys department of buildings in 1985 
department officials misinterpreted a zoning map in permitting a 
31story building the error was discovered in 1986 and the 
department ordered the owners to stop work after the building had 
been topped off at 31 floors 
the new york court of appeals the states highest court ruled 
last february that the original permit in this case was invalid 
because it authorized construction above 19 floors 
but the state court said the owner must share in the blame 
even if there was municipal error in one map and in the 
mistaken administrative issuance of the original permit those 
factors would be completely outweighed in this case by the doctrine 
that reasonable diligence would have readily uncovered the 
correct limitations the state court said 
it also rejected arguments by parkview associates that the 
citys order to reduce the building size is an unconstitutional 
taking of property without due process 
that issue cannot be addressed now because the builders have not 
applied for a zoning variance the state court said 
lawyers for parkview associates said it is the victim of 
grotesque mistreatment stuck with a vacant building and 
mounting losses while unable to get any income from the property

the supreme court today agreed to consider 
for the second time in two years the authority of states to deny 
unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their sabbath 
the court said it will decide whether illinois officials 
lawfully refused to pay benefits to a man whose refusal to work was 
not based on the doctrine of any established religious body 
william frazee of peoria was disqualified from receiving 
unemployment benefits after turning down in 1984 a temporary job 
assignment that would have required him to work on a sunday 
frazee said his understanding of the requirements and tenets of 
christianity is that nonemergency work on sundays is forbidden 
the illinois department of employment security state ruled that 
frazees rejection of the job offering disqualified him from 
receiving unemployment benefits state officials said a refusal to 
work due to religious convictions must be based on some tenets or 
dogma accepted by the individual of some church sect or 
denomination and not on individually held religious scruples 
a state appeals court rejected frazees appeal the injunction 
against sunday labor must be found in a tenet or dogma of an 
established religious sect frazee does not profess to be a 
member of any such sect the appeals court ruled 
in three previous rulings the supreme court has barred states 
from denying unemployment benefits to people who refuse certain 
work because of religious scruples but in all three cases the 
workers refusal was based on the teachings of an established 
religious sect 
the supreme court in 1963 struck down a south carolina law that 
kept a seventhday adventist from collecting unemployment benefits 
after she was fired for declining saturday work 
the court in 1981 ordered indiana to pay unemployment benefits 
to a jehovahs witness who quit when transferred by his employer to 
a job producing turrets for military tanks 
and in early 1987 the justices said florida authorities had 
violated a seventhday adventists religious freedom by denying her 
unemployment benefits because she refused to work on saturdays 
the illinois appeals court said the distinction between frazees 
case the previous supreme court cases may be a thin and fragile 
line but it said the fact that frazees refusal to work on 
sunday is not tied to any established church is a dividing line 
which we deem significant 
the illinois supreme court refused to hear frazees appeal last 
feb 3

the supreme court today left intact a ruling 
that states must compensate tree nursery owners required to destroy 
healthy citrus plants that may have been exposed to an infectious 
disease 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by florida 
officials who say the ruling could force the state to pay 250 
million to nursery owners 
the florida supreme court ruled in january that the state must 
pay two nurseries for destruction of their trees 
the state court ordered a trial to determine how much money is 
owed midflorida growers inc and himrod amp himrod citrus nursery 
both based in hardee county 
during two weeks in 1984 the state agriculture department 
burned 137880 of midfloridas trees and budwood and 143594 of 
himrods 
state officials said they were worried the plants were infected 
with citrus canker that could spread if the trees were sold to 
citrus growers 
the nursery owners said the treeeradication program was less a 
means of preventing public harm than a way of maintaining public 
confidence in the state citrus industry 
the state supreme court agreed that destruction of healthy 
trees benefited the entire citrus industry and in turn floridas 
economy thereby conferring a public benefit rather than preventing 
a public harm 
the state court also said there is a distinction when officials 
destroy decayed fruit unwholesome meat or diseased cattle in 
those cases the property is worthless the state court said 
there was ample evidence the destroyed trees were healthy the 
state court said adding that 50000 citrus plants from the two 
nurseries were sold to customers and no canker ever was discovered 
on the buyers premises 
the state court said the nursery owners are entitled to just 
compensation as required by the constitutions fifth amendment when 
officials seize private property 
florida officials said they could end up being forced to pay 
250 million to all nursery owners in the state whose trees were 
destroyed to prevent the canker disease from spreading 
the states appeal was supported by florida citrus growers and 
officials from nine other states who said the nursery owners are 
not entitled to compensation 
the states are idaho louisiana mississippi oklahoma south 
dakota tennessee vermont virginia and wyoming 
the case is department of agriculture vs midflorida growers

new york city officials concerned about 
earsplitting noise levels at central park rock concerts won a 
supreme court hearing today 
the court said it will review a ruling that the city cannot 
control the volume at concerts by using its own sound system 
operated by a citydesignated engineer 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last june ruled that the 
citys approach violates performers freedom of artistic expression 
the appeals court said in the highly subjective realm of 
music legitimate regulation of noise levels does not justify 
standardization the required use of the citys system and 
technician forces each performer and sponsor to filter its sound 
quality tone mix and other aesthetic factors through the citys 
technician and sound system 
city officials said the ruling is unrealistic and they hinted 
the ruling might even cause a riot if it leaves officials with no 
other choice than pullling the plug on loudspeakers in the 
middle of a concert 
at issue are rules for concerts in central parks naumburg 
bandshell an amphitheater that is the citys most frequently used 
park facility 
the noisecontrol campaign is aimed at protecting visitors to 
the parks neighboring sheep meadow a 13acre area decreed a 
quiet zone by mayor edward koch in 1985 
park officials were concerned that rock groups unable to mix 
their sound very well would resort to loudness to compensate for 
that lack of skill so the city hired a consultant to install and 
run the sound system 
the constitutionality of the plan was challenged by music groups 
and rock against racism which sponsors an annual bandshell program 
of speakers opposing racism 
city officials noted that the organizations sound engineer 
when asked what should be the limit on noise said i think a 
volume that causes peoples ears to bleed would be too loud 
the 2nd circuit court said the city may regulate the volume at 
the concerts but it said that could be enforced without requiring 
the use of the citys sound system and engineer 
if all else fails the appeals court said the plug can be 
pulled on the sound to enforce the volume limit 
city officials replied pulling the plug during a concert 
before a large excited audience is not a practical alternative 
the case is ward vs rock against racism 88226

the supreme court in a case of widespread 
interest among educators today agreed to decide whether new york 
state universities may ban some commercial activities in dormitory 
rooms 
the court said it will review a ruling that students rights 
were ignored when college officials barred a pennsylvania cookware 
company from conducting its sales pitch in dormitories 
an appeal by the state university of new york suny to revive 
the ban on its various campuses received support from university 
officials in 10 states and groups representing thousands of college 
administrations nationwide 
the suny board of trustees adopted a rule in 1966 to prohibit 
most commercial enterprises from operating on state university 
campuses 
the ban was challenged by american future systems inc a 
housewares company in bryn mawr pa after one of its 
representatives was arrested in 1982 at the state university campus 
in cortland ny 
she had refused to leave a dormitory 
afs attracts customers by offering free florida vacations to 
students who arrange sales demonstrations in their dormitory rooms 
for groups of their friends 
us district judge neal p mccurn upheld the suny ban against 
such activities ruling that afs had no freespeech right to sell 
its products on campus 
but the focus of the case shifted on appeal the company 
withdrew as a plaintiff from the case and its lawyers now represent 
suny students who are challenging the prohibition 
the 2nd us circuit court of appeals last march noted the 
change as it overturned mccurns ruling 
the case no longer involves an effort by outsiders to gain 
access to university property the appeals court said rather 
it concerns only the constitutional rights of students in their 
dormitories 
the appeals court added the suny regulation survived 
constitutional scrutiny by judge mccurn only because the first 
amendment rights of students were ignored 
without spelling out the details the appeals court sent the 
case back to the judge with instructions to draw a suitable 
order that will not offend students rights to receive 
information and hear speech in their dormitory rooms 
the appeals court suggested the university find a less 
restrictive means of meeting its legitimate interest in preventing 
disruption and overcommercialization on campuses 
in a friendofthecourt legal brief officials from 
universities in 10 states said the appeals court ruling will 
seriously erode their power to control campus life 
this case implicates far more than the sale of cookware by a 
pennsylvania pots and pans purveyor the officials said the 
fundamental right of state colleges and universities to control the 
use of their premises is at issue 
the officials are from state universities in california 
connecticut florida michigan illinois ohio south carolina 
rhode island new jersey and vermont 
other groups supporting the suny appeal are the american council 
on education the american association of state colleges and 
universities the national association of state universities and 
land grant colleges and the national association of student 
personnel administrators

the supreme court agreed to decide whether 
states generally may prosecute employers for withholding accrued 
vacation pay owed fired workers 
the court said it will hear a massachusetts appeal supported by 
officials in 12 other states 
the supreme judicial court of massachusetts ruled last may that 
the federal employee retirement income security act erisa 
preempts state prosecution of a bank president accused of denying 
vacation pay to two fired vice presidents 
the vacation pay was part of the bank employee benefit plan and 
states are barred by erisa from using crimnal laws to enforce such 
plans the state court said 
we conclude that a company policy providing for payments to 
employees upon discharge of unused vacation time is an employee 
welfare benefit plan within erisa the state court said 
it added that the situation would be different if for example 
state officials alleged that an employer stole money from an 
employee benefit plan that type of misconduct would be subject to 
state laws prohibiting thievery the state court said 
erisa is designed to protect worker benefits but it differs 
from a criminal law providing fines and jail terms for violators 
the massachusetts court barred the prosecution of richard 
morash presiden of the yankee bank for finance and savings 
the yankee companies inc in may 1984 acquired the financially 
troubled home savings bank 
two vice presidents christopher winslow and william tuttle 
were fired a year later winslow said the bank owed him 14520 for 
66 unused vacation days and tuttle said he was owed 11146 for 42 
unused vacation days 
state prosecutors filed criminal charges against morash after he 
refused to pay most of the money the two vice presidents claimed 
they were owed 
morash was accused of violating a state law that applies 
specifically to employers who do not pay wages to workers 
including vacation benefits 
such laws are preempted by erisa the massachusetts court ruled 
law enforcement officials connecticut florida illinois maine 
minnesota new hampshire new york north carolina oklahoma 
vermont wisconsin and wyoming urged the high court to review the 
case 
they said if courts in other states follow masschusetts lead 
and bar enforcement of similar laws it will dramatically reduce 
the protection that workers now receive because federal law and 
enforcement mechanisms do not provide sufficient remedies for 
wrongfully denied vacation pay

the supreme court today rejected appeals by 
investors who lost money in the largest municipal bond default in 
us history stemming from a doomed nuclear power project in 
washington state 
the court citing the lack of a substantial federal 
question let stand a ruling that dismissed some key investor 
claims triggered by the 225 billion default 
the justices also rejected an appeal by the bond counsel in the 
case seeking additional legal protection 
investors ranging from individuals to major corporations sued 
the washington public power supply system and numerous others in 
1984 
the washington state supreme court last year upheld a state law 
that retroactively expanded protection for cities and utilities 
against some bondholder claims 
that ruling made it more difficult for investors to recover 
their losses by suing public agencies but at the same time the 
state court permitted other investor claims to proceed to trial 
a trial began last month in tucson ariz in which more than 
24000 bond buyers are charging fraud by 19 defendants 16 
utilities two engineering firms and a financial adviser the 
defendants allegedly withheld crucial information from investors 
who bought bonds to finance construction of two nuclear power 
plants 
the appeal acted on today challenged portions of the 1987 
washington supreme court decision upholding state law protections 
for cities and utilities the law is aimed at shielding the public 
agencies and ultimately their electricity customers from being 
sued for alleged negligence 
the law does not protect the agencies from being sued for fraud 
and those allegations are being aired in the tucson trial 
the state court said protecting the agencies from being sued for 
negligence does not interfere unlawfully with interstate commerce 
does not violate investors due process rights and does not 
illegally impair any contractual agreement between bondholders and 
issuers of the securities 
the nations highest court in 1985 rejected an earlier bid by 
investors to ease recovery of their losses 
all told investors say they have lost 7 billion the 225 
billion in bonds plus interest they would have received if there 
had been no default 
the bonds were to finance two proposed wppss nuclear plants to 
meet an anticipated increase in power needs in the northwest but 
facilities already built by the mid1970s proved adequate to supply 
the region and construction of the two new plants was abandoned in 
1982 that triggered the bond default 
eightyeight cities utilities and electrical cooperatives in 
the northwest took part in agreements to build the two plants 
in a companion case acted on today the bond counsel firm of 
wood dawson smith amp hellman appealed for greater protection from 
being sued the firm said it should be given the same protection 
afforded the public agencies that issued the bonds

the supreme court today rejected the appeal of 
a pennsylvania couple criminally convicted in their young sons 
death for trying to heal him through prayer rather than seeking 
medical care 
the court without comment let stand william and linda 
barnharts convictions for manslughter and endangering the welfare 
of a child stemming from the 1981 death of their 2yearold son 
justin 
the barnharts members of a fundamentalist religion who live in 
beaver valley pa received probationary sentences 
their appeal asked how the barnharts could be held criminally 
liable for putting their faith in god with the reasonable 
expectation that the first amendment would protect them 
the constitutions first amendment guarantees religious freedom 
a state appeals court in upholding the convictions said there 
is no easy answer in the barnharts case 
in the late spring of 1981 the barnharts detected a small lump 
in justins abdomen the lump grew over the summer and by his 
death on sept 10 justins abdomen had become quite large and 
distended 
an autopsy ordered by the cambria county coroner indicated that 
justins death was caused by a wilms tumor that weighed nearly 
five pounds 
the tumors presence and its effect on justins organs 
resulted in his death by starvation 
the barnharts made justins condition known to fellow members of 
the faith tabernacle congregation who joined in prayer for him 
the childs abdomen was anointed with oil by the churchs pastor 
the appeals court noting that three generations of the 
barnharts family have adhered to the churchs 
healingthroughprayer beliefs said the question becomes one of 
degree to what extent may a parent impose these beliefs on a minor 
child 
it concluded faced with a condition which threatened their 
childs life the parents had no choice but to seek medical help 
the appeals court however said its upholding the criminal 
convictions was not meant to denigrate the barnharts religious 
beliefs 
the pennsylvania supreme court refused to hear the barnharts 
appeal last jan 14 
in seeking help from the nations highes court the barnharts 
appeal said a significant number of americans adhere to the 
same religious principles and they along with the barnharts 
look to this court for guidance

the supreme court today killed a 75 million 
lawsuit against penthouse magazine by four warwick ri 
schoolgirls and their parents 
the court without comment let stand rulings that the 1986 
publication of a photograph of the four girls and an accompanying 
headline did not amount to libel or intentional infliction of 
emotional distress 
in the autumn of 1985 the principal of warwicks oakland beach 
elementary school decided to segregate the sexes during recess 
periods because of fighting between boys and girls 
in its reporting of the trouble the providence journalbulletin 
published a photograph showing leslie fudge jennifer ann merritt 
tina marie oliver and renee vincentbsdown sign to 
show their disapproval of the principals decision 
a story and the photo of the four girl giving the thums who ranged 
in age from 
8 to 12 were distributed nationwide by the associated press 
the april 1986 issue of penthouse published the photograph over 
a headline that read little amazons attack boys 
in a brief article the school principal was quoted as saying 
the recess segregation was enforced to protect the schools boys 
from its girls 
they kick them in the shins pull their hair and kick them 
well in various places the principal was quoe issuance of the original 
permit those 
factors would be completely outweighed in this case by the doctrine 
that reasonable diligence would have readily uncovered the 
correct limitations the state court said 
it also rejected arguments by parkview associates that the 
citys order to reduce the building size is an unconstitutional 
taking of property without due process 
that issue cannot be addressed now because the builders have not 
applied for a zoning variance the state court said 
lawyers for parkview associates said it is the victim of 
grotesque mistreatment stuck with a vacant building and 
mounting losses while unable to get any income from the property 
the case is parkview associates vs new york city 871837

the supreme court today refused to force an 
insurance company to help pay for cleaning up dioxin a highly 
toxic chemical disposed of in various missouri locations in the 
early 1970s 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that an 
insurance policy held by the chemical firm responsible for the 
pollution did not make the insurance company liable for cleanup 
costs 
dioxin has been linked to cancer liver and immune system 
disorders and a serious skin condition called chloracne 
in 1982 the federal government bought out homes and property in 
times beach mo because of dioxin contamination what was once a 
town of 2240 residents ceased to exist in 1985 when times beachs 
aldermen voted to disincorporate the town 
in the appeal acted on today missouri attorney general william 
a webster said his state faces spending tens of millions of 
dollars to clean up the dioxin 
as of november 1986 missouri already had spent nearly 3 
million to clean up the dioxin contamination and cleanup is 
ongoing webster said the states projected share of the cost 
to clean up primary dioxincontaminated sites in missouri is 
20 million 
the dioxin a waste product from a verona mo plant owned by 
the nowdefunct ortheastern pharmaceutical and chemical co 
nepacco was disposed of in various ways 
in 1971 nepacco arranged to dispose of at least 85 55gallon 
drums of wastes in a trench near a verona farm 
in 1971 and 1972 dioxincontaminated wastes from the verona 
plant were spread on the bubbling springs stables in fenton mo 
and roads in times beach to control dust 
from 1970 to 1972 nepacco was insured by continental insurance 
companies its policy required continental to pay all sums which 
the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages 
the federal environmental protection agency sued nepacco in 
1982 alleging that it had caused endangerment to health and the 
environment 
the chemical firm was held liable for certain cleanup costs 
missouri sued nepacco in 1983 in an effort to recover other 
cleanup costs sparking continental to sue nepacco to protect 
itself against insurance claims 
the full 8th us circuit court of appeals ruled last feb 26 
that the word damages in the nepacco insurance policy did not 
apply to cleanup costs a form of equitable relief 
the case is missouri vs continental insurance 871953

the supreme court today left intact a 483 
million judgment awarded trans world airlines against a company 
founded by the late billionaire howard hughes 
the court without comment rejected arguments by summa corp 
and william r lummis administrator of the hughes estate that the 
award should be thrown out 
the delaware supreme court upheld the award last april 4 in a 
case that began in 1962 
summa corp formerly called hughes tool co or toolco owned 78 
percent of twa stock when toolco was sued by other twa shareholders 
the minority shareholders said twa was denied an opportunity to 
be competitive and profitable because toolco refused to allow the 
airline to purchase its own jets in the 1950s twa was forced to 
lease jets and buy some from toolco the suit said 
for reasons clearly attributable to the eccentric or 
idiosyncratic business methods of howard hughes twa was unable to 
establish a jet fleet as quickly as its competitors the delaware 
supreme court ruled 
it upheld a lower court ruling that awarded twa more than 172 
million plus interest of about 311 million 
hughes began acquiring twa stock in 1939 and increased his 
holdings to 78 percent by 1958 
the civil aeronautics board which was interested in toolcos 
experimental work in developing airplane parts for the military 
approved the acquisition of twa 
the nations highest court ruled in 1973 that toolco did not 
violate federal antitrust laws when buying up twa stock 
but the twa minority shareholders then sued in state court in 
delaware charging toolco with violating state corporation laws 
that require companies to seek the best interest of stockholders 
after more than a decade of pretrial maneuvering a state court 
found toolco violated its fiduciary duty to twa 
the delaware supreme court in upholding the verdict said the 
1973 us supreme court decision did not give toolco blanket 
immunity from being sued 
the state supreme court said as a whole toolco acted for its 
sole benefit at the expense of its fiduciary duties to twas 
minority shareholders 
the state court said toolco through the lease and sale of 
planes to twa accrued substantial profits reportable as capital 
gains as well as other tax benefits furthermore toolco 
structured the transactions to minimize its exposure to risk at the 
expense of twas profits such conduct hardly comports with basic 
concepts of fair dealing 
the state court also rejected toolcos argument that it delayed 
twas acquisition of jets in the 1950s because it was waiting for 
jets with true transatlantic capability 
other airlines were buying the jets for their transatlantic 
routes until the later models were available the state court said 
in the appeal acted on today summa corp said the delaware 
court ruling is a threat to the supremacy of federal statutes and 
federal agency orders 
the case is summa corp vs twa 88149

before the 100th congress shuts down its 
members likely will be fighting old battles against illegal drugs 
and child pornography and new ones over child care and mandatory 
parental leave from work 
congress also may approve legislation to apply the firstever 
antilobbying restrictions on former members of congress and the 
house could change its rules to extend civil rights protections to 
its own employees 
with the possibility of congress adjourning for the year this 
week theres no guarantee that any controversial measures will 
pass but many often do in the lastminute frenzy that usually 
accompanies the end of a congressional session 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said a hybrid 
pornographychild careparental leave bill is less important than 
the antidrug measure 
if you asked the american people which is more important the 
drug bill would be on everybodys list he said friday 
the social issues in the parental leave bill have yet to be 
defined by the presidential candidates dole said adding it 
seems to me these issues ought to be looked at in the full light of 
day in 1989 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva agreed the 
drug bill is exceedingly important but said the other three 
issues should be approved before lawmakers leave 
what could be more important than these he said contending 
that the presidential campaign should not influence congress byrd 
said let us remove them from the national debate lets enact 
them now the responsibility is ours why put it off so the 
presidential and vice presidential candidates can debate who is 
more profamily 
the house has scheduled a vote probably tuesday on overriding 
president reagans veto of the textile and apparel trade act the 
legislation would limit the growth of textile and apparel imports 
to 1 percent per year and hold footwear imports to 1986 levels 
countries that increase their purchases of us agricultural 
goods could be given preference in the awarding of the quotas 
senate democratic leaders have not announced their plans on an 
override 
the house on sept 22 voted 37530 for its version of the 
antidrug bill which authorizes some 2 billion in new spending 
and includes provisions to punish recreational users and murderers 
alike 
but the legislation includes a number of gettough provisions 
that may face court challenges and theres no telling whether the 
senate will accept them if the senate does approve a bill the two 
houses could get bogged down in conference 
the senate bill will have a similar price tag but includes a 
number of differences it does not include house provisions for 
strong civil fines against drug users the death penalty for those 
who kill during drugrelated crimes and language to admit evidence 
in federal court that was seized illegally by officers acting in 
good faith 
the parental leave component of the senate legislation would 
require businesses with more than 50 employees to give workers at 
least 10 weeks of leave to cope with a newborn newly adopted or 
seriously ill child or a workers own serious illness 
some of the most adamant opponents of the leave measure added it 
last week to a bill strengthening laws and penalties against child 
pornography and obscenity 
the child care section would be modeled on the act for better 
child care services a democratic initiative centered on subsidies 
to help families pay for day care 
the antilobbying measure not only would place restrictions on 
recently retired members of congress but on former presidents and 
vice presidents 
it also would expand current lobbying restrictions on former 
executive branch officials 
the senate already has approved its own set lobbying 
prohibitions for those who quit the executive branch or leave 
congress both measures are aimed at those who leave the government 
and then immediately lobby their former colleagues usually on 
issues with which they were involved 
the house also is slated to vote on a proposed rules change to 
extend civil rights protections to all employees of the house the 
measure would establish an internal enforcement process 
the rule would provide all house employees and job applicants 
with protection against discrimination based on race color 
national origin religion sex handicap or age the language is 
patterned after federal civil rights law 
the senate is preparing to consider a bill that would make 
hundreds of changes and create some protections for taxpayers 
involved in irs disputes 
unlike most of the other tax bills of the 1980s there is little 
in this legislation to draw the concern of the average family most 
of the changes are intended to clear up ambiguities or correct 
errors in the 1986 tax overhaul but there are tidbits for some 
farmers oil drillers freelance writers firsttime homebuyers 
banks and workers who receive educational assistance from their 
employers 
appearing doomed as the session headed toward an end were clean 
air act revisions that advocates say would step up the nations 
battle against urban smog acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals 
attempts by george mitchell dmaine to put together a 
consensus in the senate were far from successful last week with 
deep regional divisions over acid rain provisions the main 
stumbling block

author mickey spillanes exwife failed today 
in a supreme court bid to alter her divorce settlement 
the justices without comment let stand nevada court decisions 
dismissing sherri spillanes lawsuit contesting the 18000 
settlement she received in 1983 from spillane creator of the 
fictional detective mike hammer 
the couple had been married in california in 1964 but according 
to court records they did not live together after 1979 during that 
time spillane resided in murrells inlet sc and his wife lived 
in california 
spillane whose books have sold more than a million copies 
around the world for years has been a familiar figure in 
television beer commercials 
sherri spillane who appeared on the covers of several of 
spillanes books tried to have their divorce settlement altered in 
1985 she contended among other things that spillane fraudulently 
concealed community property assets 
one state judge noted that the former mrs spillane obtained a 
marriage license to marry michael standing 20 minutes after her 
divorce from spillane was final 
the judge said that while still married to spillane sherri 
spillane had a longterm love affair with standing 
the court will not pass judgment on morality but such actions 
certainly are not those of a caring faithful loving spouse the 
state judge said 
the nevada supreme court threw out the lawsuit last year 
the case is spillane vs spillane 8845

a controversial religious group seeking to 
avoid paying an arkansas state sales tax on goods and services it 
furnishes to members lost a supreme court appeal today 
the court without comment let stand a ruling that the alamo 
foundation must pay the taxes on meals clothing goods and 
services provided to its members who in turn work for the 
foundation 
the foundation also based in california runs a restaurant a 
grocery store two service stations a clothing store and an auto 
repair shop in arkansas the businesses are run for profit and 
foundation members also called associates work there without 
receiving salaries 
the arkansas supreme court ruled last march that the members are 
paid by having their material needs met by the foundation 
for example the state court said the alamo restaurant had 
total sales of 23 million from sept 1 1977 through aug 31 
1980 during that period 14 million worth of food was sold to 
the general public and the balance was consumed by alamo members 
and their families 
the state court said that the food was transferred to the 
members in exchange for their work and therefore the foundation 
must pay taxes on the transfers 
the simple fact that the alamo foundation is a religious and 
charitable organizae split between the two contending sponsors 
the party commission also was awarded the sponsorship of the 
debate this wednesday in omaha neb between democratic vice 
presidential candidate lloyd bentsen and his republican 
counterpart dan quayle 
the league had already signed contracts for a hall in los 
angeles and made other arrangments for the second bushdukakis 
debate 
but knowledgeable sources said there was no agreement about the 
stage podiums or panel of questioners for the second debate and 
that the campaigns had not discussed final arrangements with the 
league by late last week

the supreme court today turned away an appeal 
accusing defeated high court nominee robert h bork of improperly 
participating in a case just before he quit as a federal judge 
the court without comment rejected arguments that borks 
failure to disqualify himself from a libel case violated the 
conservative liberty lobby groups dueprocess rights 
liberty lobby sued the wall street journal for 50 million over 
a 1984 article and a 1985 column that appeared in the newspaper 
the column was written by suzanne garment a journal writer 
whose husband leonard garment is a longtime friend of borks 
garment a washington lawyer served as borks chief spokesman 
during an unsuccessful campaign to win senate confirmation of 
borks nomination to the supreme court 
the senate rejected bork by a 5842 vote last october 
borks participation in the liberty lobby case was challenged 
because of his relationship with the garments 
in both the article and column liberty lobby was referred to as 
antisemitic and was linked to books authored by an advocate of 
racial betterment through genetic selection 
although liberty lobby admits to being an antizionist 
organization it denies being antisemitic the lawsuit also denied 
any links with the authors works 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson whose participation 
in the case also was challenged dismissed the lawsuit in 1986 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals here 
upheld the libel suits dismissal last feb 5 in an opinion 
written by bork 
bork quit the federal bench that same day 
in his opinion for the appellate panel bork said we tend to 
agree with the district court that if the term antisemitic has a 
core factual meaning then the truth of the description was proved 
here 
the appeals court also rejected liberty lobbys denial of a link 
to the mentioned books published by noontide press in torrance 
calif 
the record evidence that both group treasurer willis carto 
and liberty lobby exercise substantial financial and editorial 
control over the publishing activities of noontide is in our view 
compelling bork wrote 
the full court of appeals last feb 25 denied liberty lobbys 
request to have its lawsuit revived and bork disqualified 
the case is liberty lobby vs dow jones amp co 872053

the supreme court today let stand a decision 
giving the federal government greater water rights in its 
management of national forests in california 
the court without comment rejected arguments by california 
officials that the federal government does not have the same water 
rights under state law as private landowners 
in a 1976 case involving water rights for hallett creek in 
lassen county the us forest service claimed two kinds of rights 
for plumas national forest lands 
a reserved right under federal law for primary purposes 
such as firefighting and road watering during timber harvests 
a riparian right under california law for secondary 
purposes including wildlife enhancement 
the state water resources control board upheld the federal 
governments claim for a reserved right but denied its claim for a 
riparian right one enjoyed by private landowners whose property 
is touched by a body of water 
the 1976 ruling meant the forest service was entitled to divert 
and use 95000 gallons of hallett creek water each year it had 
sought an additional 547000 gallons each year for wildlife 
enhancement 
joined by the sierra club the federal government appealed the 
state board ruling 
california courts including the state supreme court last feb 
18 ruled for the federal government 
california officials then sought the supreme courts help in the 
appeal acted on today that appeal was supported in a 
friendofthecourt brief submitted by eight other states 
kansas nebraska nevada north dakota oklahoma south dakota 
washington and wyoming 
the case is california vs us 872010

the supreme court beginning its new term 
today announced it will expand its study of drug testing in the 
workplace agreeing to decide whether a railroad may require 
workers to take the tests routinely 
the court began its 19881989 term in a whirl of activity 
acting on about 1000 cases in its first day before the term ends 
it is expected to hand down important decisions on such other 
issues as civil rights affirmative action and the death penalty 
in todays drugtesting case the justices said they will review 
a ruling that barred the consolidated rail corporation or conrail 
from imposing the tests without permitting collective bargaining 
over the issue 
the court announced earlier this year that it would review two 
other drugtesting cases one involving railway workers and the 
other the us customs service 
in the earlier railway case the justices will decide whether 
constitutional privacy rights of workers are violated by federal 
regulations requiring blood and urine tests for those involved in 
serious train accidents 
the customs services tests are conducted for those seeking drug 
enforcement jobs 
todays action significantly expands the scope of the courts 
review by including a case in which a private company rather than 
the government is adopting mandatory drug tests 
all three cases will be decided in the courts new term which 
will conclude by july 
in other action today the court 
agreed to decide whether displays of a christmas nativity 
scene and a menorah symbolizing the jewish holiday of chanukah 
should be allowed at two government buildings in pittsburgh 
the justices said they will review a ruling that each display 
violated the constitutionally required separation of church and 
state 
agreed to decide whether states may be sued in federal court 
by parents seeking to enforce a law aimed at assuring adequate 
education for handicapped children 
the justices said they will hear an appeal by pennsylvania 
officials ordered to pay a years private school tuition for a 
student with a learning disability 
rejected the appeal of a pennsylvania couple criminally 
convicted in their young sons death for trying to heal him through 
prayer rather than seeking medical care 
the court without comment let stand william and linda 
barnharts convictions for manslaughter and endangering the welfare 
of a child stemming from the 1981 death of their 2yearold son 
justin 
left intact a 483 million judgment awarded trans world 
airlines against a company founded by the late billionaire howard 
hughes 
the court without comment rejected arguments by summa corp 
and william r lunnis administrator of the hughes estate that the 
award should be thrown out 
agreed to decide whether the federal government may continue 
to bar newspapers from carrying advertisements for privately run 
lotteries and other games of chance 
the justices said they will study a minnesota newspaper 
association challenge to a postal law effectively prohibiting such 
advertising 
agreed to decide whether communities may seek to protect young 
teenagers by barring anyone over 18 from dance halls or other 
establishments catering to minors 
the court said it will consider reinstating a dallas ordinance 
that licensed certain dance halls on the condition only teens 14 to 
18 and their parents or guardians be admitted as patrons 
refused to force an insurance company to help pay for cleaning 
up dioxin a highly toxic chemical disposed of in various missouri 
locations in the early 1970s 
the justices without comment let stand a ruling that an 
insurance policy held by the chemical firm responsible for the 
pollution did not make the insurance company liable for cleanup 
costs 
agreed to consider the authority of states to deny 
unemployment benefits to people who refuse to work on their sabbath 
the court said it will decide whether illinois officials 
lawfully refused to pay benefits to a man whose refusal to work was 
not based on the doctrine of any established religious body 
in the conrail case the railroad announced in february 1987 
that it unilaterally would check for drugs as part of a urinalysis 
administered periodically to workers and also when they returned to 
work after an absence 
the railway said the need for the tests were manified by an 
accident at chase md on jan 4 1987 in which an amtrak 
passenger train collided with conrail locomotives killing 16 and 
injuring 174 the conrail engineer and brakeman subsequently were 
found to have been using marijuana 
conrail had been conducting urine tests since 1976 as part of 
periodic physical examinations administered to workers at intervals 
varying between one and three years depending on the employees age 
and job classification but those tests were aimed at discovering 
whether a worker for example had diabetes and not whether the 
employee was using drugs 
railway labor unions said adding the drug screening component to 
the urinalysis violated the federal railway labor act 
the unions said the expanded tests were a major change in 
working conditions and must be submitted to collective bargaining 
the 3rd us circuit court of appeals in philadelphia agreed 
with the unions 
conrails addition of drug screening to the urinalysis 
examination of employees as to whom conrail has no particularized 
suspicion of drug use changes the terms and conditions governing 
the employment relationships the appeals court said it 
therefore constitutes a major dispute which conrail cannot impose 
unilaterally 
the appeals court noted that drug and alochol abuse is a major 
problem for the transportation industry 
it cited studies estimating 25 percent of railroad workers drink 
on duty and showing that alcohol and other drugs were responsible 
for 37 deaths 80 injuries and 34 million in property damage 
between 1975 and 1985 
but dealing with the problem must be accomplished at the 
bargaining table the appeals court said 
the drugtesting case is conrail vs railway labor executives

the supreme court today turned away arguments 
that the policies of the bonneville power administration are 
costing electricity consumers in california billions of dollars 
the justices without comment decided not to order changes in 
the way the bpa distributes hydroelectric power throughout the 
pacific northwest and california 
the bpa an independent selffinanced marketer of electric 
power within the federal department of energy sells electricity 
generated by 31 federal dams in the pacific northwest it also 
operates a system of electric power transmission lines 
the legal controversy acted on today involves the transmission 
line system which is called the pacific northwestpacific 
southwest intertie 
congress established the system in the late 1960s in order for 
the pacific northwest and pacific southwest to exchange power when 
one region has a surplus supply and the other region has a heavy 
demand 
bpa owns and operates most of the intertie transmission lines 
north of the oregoncalifornia border lines south of that boundary 
are owned by several california utilities 
bpa policies on distribution of power over the transmission 
lines were challenged in a lawsuit by the two california state 
agencies the public utilities commission and the energy resources 
conservation and development commission 
the agencies contended that the bpa access policies illegally 
excluded lowcost energy generated in the pacific northwest and 
canada from the transmission system the state agencies said 
lowercost energy thus was prevented from reaching california 
consumers 
the 9th us circuit court of appeals ruled for the bpa last 
november 
in seeking the supreme courts help lawyers for the california 
agencies said the transmission line access policy will produce a 
transfer of wealth between regions of the united states on the 
order of billions of dollars 
reagan administration lawyers urged the justices to reject the 
appeals 
the cases are california energy resources conservation and 
development commission vs bpa 871835 and california puc vs 
bpa 871836

opposition labor party leader neil 
kinnock who crushed a leftwing attempt to unseat him as his 
partys leader today defeated a bid to block apolicy review that 
supports the role of private enterprise 
kinnock kicked off the partys annual weeklong convention sunday 
night by crushing a challenge for his job by the doyen of the party 
left former cabinet minister tony benn 
the more than 1000 conference delegates today rejected the 
attempt to kill the policy review which would push the socialists 
toward the center by a vote of more than 10to1 
kinnock ordered the review after labors third successive 
election defeat by conservative prime minister margaret thatcher in 
1987 
in a break with traditional party ideology the review abandons 
a previous commitment to renationalize all the industries sold by 
mrs thatcher since she came to power in 1979 in addition it 
drops some of the left wings favorite causes by partially 
accepting mrs thatchers curbs on labor unions 
a series of leftwing speakers accused kinnock of putting 
forward what one called a pompous document which rejects 
socialism 
in a ballot at the start of the conference sunday evening 
kinnock 46 overwhelmingly defeated his challenger tony benn 63 
kinnock appeared certain to use the victory as a new mandate to 
push the party toward the center 
kinnock received 88 percent of the votes of an electoral college 
composed of labor union leaders legislators and local constituency 
parties benn has pledged to continue trying to stop what he calls 
the virtual repudiation of socialism at the blackpool 
conference 
the final stages of the policy review will be presented to the 
partys annual conference next year along with the documents 
debated today 
in another vote sunday kinnocks deputy roy hattersley also 
defeated on the first ballot with a twothirds majority a bid to 
unseat him by two leftists john prescott and eric heffer 
kinnock hailed the votes as a great honor and a great trust 
it imposes a great duty too said kinnock we want to use 
this great victory to secure a greater victory at the next general 
election 
benn has scheduled a series of fringe meetings through the 
weeklong conference in this northeast england resort to press home 
his argument that kinnock in the hope of averting another election 
defeat has ditched labors fundamental policies these include a 
commitment at least on paper for the government to control all 
means of ownership and production 
kinnock had been expected to defeat benns challenge by a wide 
margin in addition to getting virtually unanimous backing from the 
labor union leaders who comprise 40 percent of the electoral 
college he also received majority support from the often hostile 
labor constitutency parties 
all but 35 of the partys 228 parliamentary legislators voted 
for kinnock 
latest opinion polls show labor narrowing its big gap with the 
ruling conservatives but still trailing them by between 9 and 5 
points despite a fall in the conservatives popularity

the supreme court today agreed to decide 
whether those who win partial victories in civil rights lawsuits 
losing on the central issue are entitled to recover their 
attorneys fees 
the court said it will hear an appeal by school teachers in 
texas who challenged antiunion regulations 
the regulations adopted by the garland independent school 
district barred teacher union representatives from visiting 
schools during regular school hours or using school public address 
systems or other communications facilities 
the rules also prohibited private conversations among teachers 
regarding the employee organizations and also barred any teacher 
from using a schools internal mail system or bulletin board to 
discuss union activities 
the 5th us circuit court of appeals upheld the regulations 
affecting union representatives but the appeals court said it 
violates the freespeech and freeassociation rights of teachers to 
ban private conversations or prevent them from using the mail or 
bulletin board facilities 
the appeals court ruled in february that the texas state 
teachers association and the garland education association which 
filed the suit are not entitled to be reimbursed for attorneys 
fees 
federal civil rights laws provide that the prevailing party 
in such cases is entitled to reimbursement the idea is to provide 
an incentive for lawyers to represent civil rights plaintiffs who 
frequently have limited financial resources and find it difficult 
to get legal representation 
at issue in the case acted on today is what constitutes a 
prevailing party 
the 5th circuit court said the teacher unions did not succeed 
on the central issue of their suit and did not obtain the primary 
relief sought the main thrust of this lawsuit was their attempt 
to open up garland independent school district campuses during 
school hours to outside representatives of employee organizations 
they failed in this attempt 
the appeals court acknowledged that the teachers prevailed on 
significant secondary issues 
in appealing to the supreme court the teacher groups said there 
is confusion among federal appeals courts over the prevailing 
party issue and they asked the justices to provide clear 
guidelines 
the case is texas state teachers association vs garland 
independent school district 871759

situation in northern ireland but he was not an informer

president reagan today put in a plug for the 
forthcoming 500th anniversary celebration of christopher columbus 
voyage to america but confessed he has a little trouble with the 
observances name 
its called the quincentenary and it may take another 500 
years before i can say that easily reagan told a crowd in the 
white house east room as he signed a proclamation declaring oct 10 
as columbus day 
later in his remarks the president stumbled over the word 
referring to the christopher columbus quincentenni centenary 
commission that he appointed to make plans for the 1992 
observance 
next time he came to the word he paused grinned and got it 
right quincentenary 
whatever you call it said reagan it will be a time when 
americans from all backgrounds look back on all that voyage has 
meant to mankind over the past half millenium

a onetime top aide to aerican samoas former 
nonvoting delegate to congress received a threemonth prison term 
monday for masterminding a payroll padding scheme that netted 
130920 
matthew iuli who was chief aide to former del fofo if sunia 
was sentenced by us district judge stanley harris on his guilty 
pleas to conspiring to defraud the government and filing a false 
payroll claim 
sunia 51 a democrat who had represented american samoa since 
1981 resigned his seat after pleading guilty aug 3 to a single 
conspiracy charge he could receive a fiveyear prison term and a 
250000 fine when sentenced tuesday by harris 
the judge rejected a defense request unopposed by prosecutors 
that iuli be placed on probation because he had not personally 
benefited from the scheme and had fully cooperated with prosecutors 
i think that probation is not appropriate in your case 
harris said noting the extent of the crime 
a period of incarceration is not necessary to deter you or 
rehabilitate you but to deter others harris said there are 
an awful lot of other offices up on capitol hill 
iuli could have received two fiveyear sentences 
as part of his guilty plea iuli agreed to pay the government 
25000 as restitution and has already made a 10000 payment 
defense lawyer richard saltsman told harris 
both andary and saltsman noted that iuli did not personally 
benefit from the scheme under which he arranged for paychecks to 
be issued to samoans who were falsely listed as working for sunia 
between february 1983 and august 1986 78 paychecks worth 
130920 were issued by the government as a result of false payroll 
vouchers submitted by sunias office according to court papers

americans believe bribetaking is rampant in the 
federal government a media generalassociated press poll has found 
the national survey of 1125 adults found deep skepticism of 
government integrity in the most critical finding an overwhelming 
70 percent said they thought taking illegal payoffs for special 
favors was widespread 
fully half the respondents called the government dishonest 
overall and seven in 10 called it poorly managed even more 82 
percent said they were not surprised to learn of recent corruption 
charges involving the pentagon 
on specific cases a plurality said former attorney general 
edwin meese iii should have been charged with crimes and half 
opposed the suggestion of a presidential pardon for former national 
security adviser john poindexter the highest official charged in 
the irancontra case 
respondents were evenly split on a pardon for poindexters 
assistant former marine lt col oliver north who gained support 
through his defense of his actions at congressional hearings last 
year 
the reagan administration did not carry heavy blame for the 
overall doubt about government honesty while 43 percent said the 
administration had done a bad job of enforcing ethical standards 
40 percent said it had done a good job the split was insignificant 
given the polls threepoint error margin 
also 51 percent said the administration had done a good job of 
managing the government even though most said the government was 
poorly managed overall and 55 percent did not blame the 
administration for the pentagon scandal 
democrats predominated in the 35 percent who did blame the 
administration for the pentagon case which involves allegations of 
payoffs in the awarding of military contracts but large majorities 
of all groups republicans and independents included were 
unsurprised by the charges 
similarly majorities of all demographic and ideological groups 
said they believed taking payoffs was widespread in the government 
from a low of 60 percent of republicans to a high of 82 percent 
of liberals overall just 20 percent of the respondents did not 
believe payoffs were widespread 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis proposed tighter 
ethics rules and sharply criticized the administration for its 
ethical performance last week but the poll conducted sept 614 
found respondents split evenly on whether dukakis or republican 
nominee george bush would be better at enforcing ethical standards 
in the irancontra case poindexter and north have been charged 
with conspiring while in the white house to sell arms to iran in 
exchange for american hostages and to divert the proceeds to the 
nicaraguan rebels their trial will not take place before the 
election bush has said he hopes north is acquitted 
fifty percent in the poll agreed that poindexter should have 
been charged 30 percent said not and the rest didnt know there 
was a greater division on north fortythree percent agreed with 
the charges 42 percent did not 
the breakdown was the same on whether president reagan should 
pardon the men on poindexter half said no and 30 percent yes on 
north 41 percent said he should be pardoned 44 percent said not 
meese attorney general since 1985 resigned this summer saying 
he had been vindicated of corruption allegations by a special 
prosecutors decision not to seek charges against him the 
prosecutor said meese probably violated tax laws and conflict of 
interest laws but did not file charges because he had no evidence 
that meese sought personal gain 
fortysix percent in the survey however said meese should have 
been charged with crimes thirty percent agreed with the decision 
not to charge him and the remaining 23 percent had no opinion 
republicans were the strongest supporters of meese north and 
poindexter with democrats the greatest critics and independents 
more divided on ethics and management as well republicans 
strongly supported the administration and most democrats rated it 
poorly most independents said the administration had done well on 
management but they were split on ethical enforcement

the military government said nearly all 
civil servants and factory workers obeyed an order to return to 
work monday ending a monthlong general strike aimed at ending 26 
years of authoritarian rule 
the state radio announced that attendance at 18 ministries and 
various departments was about 95 percent while all civil servants 
returned to their jobs in the second largest city of mandalay the 
strike began aug 8 
the radio said security forces killed four more people who were 
looting a gasoline station in eastern rangoon bringing to about 
430 the number of people who by official count have died since gen 
saw maung seized power in a military coup sept 18 and ruthlessly 
put down antigovernment demonstrations 
although tens of thousands of workers returned to their jobs 
many left after drawing their salaries and signing attendance 
sheets the government had earlier ordered a resumption of work 
under penalty of dismissal 
the only acts of defiance reported in the capital monday were 
several small hitandrun demonstrations by students 
the strike was the first mass labor agitation since strongman ne 
win seized power in 1962 and instituted a militarybacked 
oneparty system 
despite the apparent end of the strike it appeared unlikely the 
government machinery and stateowned factories would regain 
momentum in the near future 
most of the countrys more than 1000 factories had ceased 
operations and are faced with lack of spare parts and raw 
materials a large number have been ransacked by looters who stole 
or destroyed machinery and materials 
several thousand students who spearheaded the antigovernment 
protests have fled to remote border areas under the control of the 
karen and other ethnic minorities who are also fighting the central 
government 
associated press newswoman molly yong reporting from the karen 
guerrilla camp of thay baw bo said rebel leader gen bo mya monday 
appealed for international aid to 3500 students who have fled to 
his rebel bases 
bo mya said the karens would allow the students to set up 
independently run camps where the rebels would provide military 
training and arm the students for a war against the militaryrun 
government in rangoon 
the karens are among a dozen major ethnic minority groups in 
burma a country of 38 million people the karens who live largely 
along the thaiburmese border and in the irrawaddy delta number 
about 2 million 
during the colonial period large numbers were converted to 
christianity by american missionaries and enjoyed relative freedom 
under the british rule 
feeling that the promise of autonomy within a federal system 
after independence had been broken a number of karens fled to 
jungle areas along the border and in 1949 rose up in rebellion 
managing to fight their way to the gates of rangoon before being 
pushed back to their sanctuaries 
bo mya said recently that his insurgent group called the karen 
national union fields 17000 troops

heavyweight boxing champion mike tyson called police over the 
weekend when he flew into a rage but no complaints were filed and 
no arrests were made authorities confirmed today 
the man has done nothing wrong chief thomas j sciaretta 
said at a news conference following reports that tyson hurled 
furniture through windows of his mansion sunday morning its his 
home hes entitled to do anything he pleases provided no one is 
injured 
tysons rage was sparked by an interview his wife actress robin 
givens and motherinlaw ruth roper had with barbara walters 
which was broadast friday on abcs 2020 the new york post and 
new york daily news reported 
in the interview givens and roper portrayed tyson 22 as a 
scary and frightening person to live with 
the post said tyson who has said he is manicdepressive hurled 
a sugar bowl a fireplace andiron and chairs through the windows of 
his home the news said tyson brandished an instrument from the 
fireplace and ran through the home smashing windows 
the police chief said there was damage but would disclose only 
that there was broken glass in the foyer 
people suffering from manicdepression can alternate between 
moods of abnormal excitability and mental depression in last 
weeks television interview tyson said he would not take 
medication for the ailment 
sciaretta disclosed the barest of details of the case 
he said he believed it was givens a star of televisions head 
of the class who called his department about a disturbance at 
tysons northern new jersey estate 
when police arrived they spoke with givens and roper who asked 
the officers to speak to tyson and calm him down sciaretta said

the situation but the boxer felt the police presence was 
unwarranted the chief said

cayton tysons manager 
but the 83yearold woman who has been characterized as tysons 
adopted mother camille ewald told the post that tysons 
behavior comes as no surprise in light of the 2020 interview 
i think that if i was mike i would have choked her right then 
and there on that show she said she was trying to belittle 
him take everything away his dignity and embarrass him in 
public 
the reported incident came one day after the three celebrated 
ropers birthday the post said the champion didnt seem to be 
that upset saturday as he watched the heavyweight olympic bout on 
tv with finkel and boxer ed hopson 
it was only the latest in a series of problems for tyson last 
month he crashed in his car and was knocked unconscious forcing 
him to postpone a match and news reports later said he had 
threatened beforehand to kill himself 
meanwhile boxer mitch green who had an impromptu fight with 
tyson outside a harlem clothing store in august was arrested

slope in 1969 eight oil companies constructed an 800mile pipeline 
to the allweather port of valdez on the states pacific coast 
the pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of some 9 billion 
the alaska law aimed at promoting oil production extinguished 
the land claims of native alaskans by compensating them with money 
arctic is one of 13 regional corporations given ownership of 
lands formerly held by natives arctic leases much of its 45 
million acres for the benefit of its inupiat eskimo shareholders 
oil from arctics lands likely will start being shipped through 
the pipeline sometime in the 1990s and the oils value to arctic 
will be reduced dollarfordollar by charges levied for 
transporting it 
after nine years of administrative proceedings alaska and the 
pipelines eight owners reached a rate agreement in 1986 
arctic attempted to challenge the agreement contending that the 
perbarrel rates it yielded are too high 
but the federal energy regulatory commission approved the 
agreement as uncontested after ruling that arctic was not 
particularly aggrieved by the pipeline rates 
a federal appeals court here upheld the commission ruling last 
oct 27 after noting that the rate agreement is not binding on 
arctic and that arctic is free to challenge the rates once oil 
from its lands begin to pass through the pipeline 
arctic can properly be left out in the cold for the moment 
the appeals court ruled adding the commission acted within its 
lawful authority and discretion in closing a long and wearisome 
chapter in the saga of transalaska pipeline rate regulation 
the pipelines owners are amerada hess arco bp exxon mobil 
phillips sohio and unocal 
the case is arctic slope regional corp vs ferc 871869

a federal appeals court today granted a stay of 
execution for a convicted killer who had said he wanted his 
execution by lethal injection to take place tonight as scheduled 
a threejudge panel of the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
granted the stay on a motion claiming that gerald smith convicted 
of fatally beating a woman with an 8pound metal bar may not be 
competent to decide on filing appeals of his sentence 
smiths execution would have been the first in missouri in 23 
years 
the panel said more time was needed for the full court to 
determine whether smith was competent to make decisions on his own 
fate 
assistant attorney general john morris said the state would file 
a motion as quickly as possible challenging the stay he said he 
did not know exactly what type of legal motion it would be 
the stay was sought by the missouri public defender commission 
on sunday about 50 death penalty opponents rallied on the 
capitol lawn just blocks from the missouri state penitentiary 
where smith was scheduled to be executed by injection at 1201 am 
tuesday three days before his 30th birthday 
speakers denounced capital punishment as statesanctioned 
homicide and called on republican gov john ashcroft or the courts 
to block the execution 
a spokesman for ashcroft a death penalty supporter has said 
the governor would not stop the execution 
the execution would be the first to be carried out since 1965 
and the first under missouris 11yearold reinstated capital 
punishment law 
smith has demanded that all appeals be dropped in the past 
hes asked that appeals be halted but later changed his mind 
however in an interview friday smith said he would not waver this 
time because he considers all further appeals hopeless 
smith remains steadfast on wanting the execution to take place 
prison spokesman dale riley said 
at the rally speakers representing the american civil liberties 
union and other antideathpenalty groups said that although smith 
was a murderer it was not the states place to execute him 
on sept 8 1980 smith used an iron bar to beat to death karen 
roberts a woman he said had given him a venereal disease and 
caused him to lose his fiancee he received a second death penalty 
for his part in the 1985 murder of fellow death row inmate robert 
baker 
if the execution is carried out it would mark the first time 
the state has executed anyone since feb 26 1965 when lloyd leo 
anderson went to the gas chamber for murdering a 15yearold st 
louis delivery boy during a drugstore robbery

the supreme court today rejected arguments 
aimed at making it easier to sue those accused of taking part in 
antitrust conspiracies uncovered years after they occurred 
the court over one dissenting vote refused to revive a lawsuit 
by colorado officials against a paving contractor accused of 
bidrigging 
justice harry a blackmun voted to hear arguments in the case 
but four votes are needed to grant such review 
colorados appeal was supported by law enforcement officials 
from most states they said a ruling that threw out the colorado 
suit rewards conspirators for the successsful concealment of 
their conspiracies and puts a generally impossible burden on 
officials pursuing bidrigging cases 
the colorado attorney generals office accused western paving 
construction co of engaging in a conspiracy to rig bids on state 
highway projects between 1971 and 1978 
the state said it learned of western pavings role in the scheme 
on july 27 1983 when federal prosecutors disclosed a case against 
another company accused of criminal bidrigging on colorado highway 
projects 
the state sued western paving seeking triple damages on july 
19 1984 that was more than four years after western pavings 
alleged participation in the conspiracy thus exceeding the statute 
of limitations in the federal antitrust law covering such 
violations 
but colorado officials said the fouryear time period should be 
extended because western paving fraudulently concealed the alleged 
conspiracy 
us district judge alfred a arraj threw out the suit in 1986 
he said fraudulent concealment occurs when a defendant takes 
affirmative steps in addition to the original wrongdoing to prevent 
the plaintiff from discovering the wrong 
colorado officials failed to allege any facts which constitute 
affirmative acts of concealment arraj said 
his ruling was upheld in a brief unsigned 44 decision by the 
10th us circuit court of appeals last march the 10th circuit 
court has jurisdiction in colorado kansas new mexico utah 
oklahoma and wyoming 
in their supreme court appeal colorado officials said that for 
the bidrigging scheme to succeed the participants were required 
actively to conceal their conduct 
the state officials said that the participants agreed among 
themselves to divide up roadbuilding projects by taking turns 
submitting low bids the designated losing companies would submit 
slightly higher bids to further enhance the illusion of 
competition the officials said 
the states supporting colorados appeal said arrajs ruling 
puts an antitrust plaintiff to the generally impossible burden of 
pleading and proving that a bidrigger took an affirmative act to 
cover up that which by its very nature is already concealed 
they said the ruling is in conflict with other federal court 
rulings 
the case is colorado vs western paving construction 872027

reward for the return of american mias by floating currency down 
the mekong river were arrested by authorities in laos on monday a 
thai hotel executive said 
donna long 45 of jacksonville nc and another american who 
asked not to be identified were arrested by laotian authorities 
and were being investigated said the executive pornthipa 
vajarabukka 
miss long told the associated press on sunday the two planned to 
drop plastic bags containing dollar bills and other currencies into 
the river and to distribute the money in villages along the laotian 
bank of the river 
the waterway forms a boundary with thailand and then flows on to 
both cambodia and vietnam each bill was stamped with a message

did before they were seized 
miss long revealed the plan on condition that the story was not 
released until the two returned or were captured 
the reward money to any cambodian laotian or vietnamese is 
being offered through the national steering committee for american 
war veterans a private miapow group which says the 24 million 
has been pledged by 21 congressmen and the american enterprise 
institute 
the us government lists 2393 americans as still missing in 
action from the indochina war in cambodia laos and vietnam the 
three indochinese governments deny that any americans are alive in 
their countries but some private american groups disagree 
in 1987 several miapow activists including relatives of mias 
floated balloons down the mekong river from the thai shore with 
offers of the 24 million reward with no known result 
members of the committee including its chairman ted sampley 
were scheduled to arrive in thailand on wednesday 
ms pornthipa a manager at ubons phatum rat hotel said the 
two sought assistance to find their way to the river and the hotel 
felt obliged to help them she said she would cross the river to 
laos something allowed for thai nationals on tuesday to deliver

the league of women voters withdrew today as 
sponsor of the presidential debate in los angeles later this month 
saying it refused to be an accessory to the hoodwinking of the 
american people by the george bush and michael dukakis campaigns 
the leagues surprise announcement immediately threw into doubt 
the second nationally televised confrontation between the 
presidential candidates which had been scheduled for oct 13 or 
oct 14 
league president nancy m neuman said the group was presented 
with a debate agreement between the bush and dukakis campaigns and 
was told that the league had to accept it 
the campaigns agreement was a closeddoor masterpiece she 
said the agreement was a done deal they told us 
it turned out that the league had two choices she said 
we could sign their closeddoor agreement and hope the event 
would rise above their manipulations or we could refuse to lend our 
trusted name to this charade 
ms neuman said the league of women voters is announcing 
today that we have no intention of becoming an accessory to the 
hoodwinking of the american people under these circumstances 
the league is withdrawing its sponsorship of the presidential 
debate scheduled for midoctober in los angeles 
in letters to bush campaign chairman james baker iii and dukakis 
campaign chairman paul brountas she said the league would 
reconsider its stance if the campaigns withdrew their 
nonnegotiable demands 
the league released a copy of the candidates agreement 
it spelled out everything ms neuman said between 
themselves the campaigns had determined what the tv cameras could 
take pictures of they had determined how they would select who 
would pose questions to their candidates 
they had determined that the press would be relegated to the 
last two rows of the hall they had determined that they would pack 
the hall with their supporters they had determined the format 
democratic national chairman paul kirk campaigning with dukakis 
in connecticut said a joint party debate commission could assume 
sponsorship and hold the second debate either as scheduled or after 
a brief delay 
the campaigns agreement calls for each sides best efforts to 
obtain a mutually agreeable sponsor if one of the original 
sponsors drop out 
there was no certainty bush would agree to a new sponsor the 
gop nominee holds a narrow lead over dukakis in national public 
opinion polls and was the one who insisted on league involvement in 
the debates 
kirk brushed aside any possibility that bush might not 
participate in a second debate 
they may try but i dont think they can he said they 
are committed to two presidential debates and the american people 
are well aware of that even if they tried to do an end run around 
it i dont think they can get out of it 
bush at edwards air force base in california said he was not 
aware of the leagues withdrawal when reporters asked bush whether 
he would attend if the joint party commission picked up 
sponsorship the vice president said i cant answer a 
hypothetical question 
the league the traditional sponsor of presidential debates was 
pushed aside in the battle for sponsorship of the first 
presidential debate held sept 25 in winstonsalem nc by a 
commission created by the two major political parties 
the dukakis campaign sided with the party commission early in 
the year but the bush campaign left the issue of sponsorship open 
until after the gop national convention in august 
then the campaigns negotiated a compromise in which the two 
scheduled debates were split between the two contending sponsors 
the party commission also was awarded the sponsorship of the 
debate this wednesday in omaha neb between democratic vice 
presidential candidate lloyd bentsen and his republican 
counterpart dan quayle 
the league had already signed contracts for a hall in los 
angeles and made other arrangments for the second bushdukakis 
debate 
but knowledgeable sources said there was no agreement about the 
stage podiums or panel of questioners for the second debate and 
that the campaigns had not discussed final arrangements with the 
league by late last week

franz josef strauss a rightwing 
state governor who upstaged federal chancellors and left his mark 
on world affairs died monday at age 73 
he was one of the architects of the federal republic west 
germany bavarian radio said during a break in somber music it 
broadcast to mark the governors death he had collapsed during a 
weekend hunting trip 
strauss was a formidable power for decades and weathered a 1962 
scandal that forced his resignation as federal defense minister he 
led the christian social union the bavarian sister party of 
chancellor helmut kohls national christian democrats 
kohls office said the chancellor was breaking off a trip to the 
far east to return to west germany 
spokesman herbert schmuelling said the government was deeply 
affected by the death of strauss foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher called him one of the most important personalities of 
german postwar history and declared his political achievements 
deserve the respect of all citizens 
his influence was particularly strong during the last decade 
when he was governor of bavaria and kohl needed approval from the 
burly boss of munich for major domestic programs 
it was in foreign affairs however that strauss insisted on 
making his influence felt and his name known 
he visited communist east germany in 1983 to deliver a credit 
line of 1 billion marks then worth 400 million in return for 
concessions that included removal of some guns and mines from the 
border 
also in 1983 strauss visited poland and czechoslovakia for 
talks with the leaders of those sovietbloc states 
in israel two years later he defended his advocacy of west 
german arms sales to saudi arabia dismissing claims that his 
country should not sell arms to arabs because of its moral 
responsibility for nazi crimes against jews 
strauss was a firm supporter of nato and its decision to base 
nuclear missiles in western europe 
he was fluent in english and often visited washington for 
meetings with us political leaders including president reagan 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said monday that reagan 
sent a message of condolence describing strauss as one of the 
great figures in the democratic history of the federal republic of 
germany he was a firm friend of the united states sharing our 
dedication to human freedom and close cooperation between our two 
countries 
an active amateur pilot strauss flew the airplane that took a 
bavarian delegation to the soviet union in december 1987 for talks 
with mikhail s gorbachev and leaders 
a month later he visited johannesburg and expressed moderate 
optimism about south africa whose 26 million blacks are denied a 
voice in national affairs he also said the white authorities 
deserved recognition for reforms 
the governor was outspoken and fervently roman catholic two 
characteristics of his mountainous southern state 
he collapsed saturday while hunting in the regensburg area with 
prince johannes von thurn und taxis one of the worlds richest men 
and west germanys largest landowner 
the leftleaning frankfurter rundschau said in its evening 
editions monday fj strauss is dead state ceremony ordered 
accompanying the frontpage article was a photograph of strauss 
and the prince both clad in traditional green loden alpine hunting 
outfits taken on a simliar outing in 1983 
an official announcement said strauss died in a regensburg 
hospital after multipleorgan failure including kidneys and 
lungs the cause of death was given as heart and circulation 
failure 
strauss had been in a coma kept alive with a respirator 
as defense minister in the early 1960s strauss claimed a report 
in der spiegel magazine criticizing military maneuvers bordered on 
treason he created further controversy by ordering several of the 
leftleaning magazines staff members arrested and was forced to 
resign in 1962 
leftist publications also accused strauss of involvement in 
payoff scandals in the purchase of military fighter jets and in 
deals involving the us aircraft company lockheed 
one of the governors favorite political sports was taunting 
leftist foes after his death the greens party said his name was 
synonomous with cold war arms buildup atomic policies and a 
magisterial understanding of politics 
strauss became a cabinet member in 1953 under west germanys 
first chancellor konrad adenauer and was finance minister the 
great coalition kurt georg kiesinger formed in 1966 with the 
leftist social democrats he became governor of bavaria in 1978 
his wife died after a car accident in 1984 his three children 
daughter monika hohlmeier and two sons maxjosef and franzgeorg

writer henry miller faces possible prosecution after complaints 
about the books explicit sexuality prosecutors said monday 
the director of public prosecutions said it is considering 
taking action over millers opus pistorum which surfaced three 
years after miller died at age 88 in june 1980

public including one from christian action research and education 
an evangelical charity that promotes traditional family values the 
prosecutors office said 
the matter is under consideration said a spokesman 
speaking anonymously in keeping with british custom 
publisher w h allen said it has sold about 60000 copies of 
the novel subtitled under the roofs of paris in the last four 
years 
britains leading news agents w h smith said it had 
withdrawn the book from its shelves not because it is being 
investigated but because it is not selling well a spokesman 
said 
if youre a customer you can still place an order for the 
book said the spokesman speaking on condition on anonymity 
miller wrote tropic of cancer and other books which gave 
frank accounts of his life and sexual exploits in new york and 
paris and were banned in the united states until 1961

vice president george 
bush taking full advantage of his incumbency greeted the 
returning discovery astronauts today as they departed the space 
shuttle with a large american flag in hand 
the vice president said it was a great day for our country 
a campaign spokesman had said that bush wanted to be the first 
person the astronauts would see upon their return and he was 
standing with several top nasa officials at the foot of the shuttle 
ramp the astronauts led bush in the traditional walkaround to 
review the shape of the ship after posing for photos bush snapped 
a salute to the astronauts 
the republican presidential nominee said wasnt that great 
over and over after the shuttle taxied to a stop here bush with 
nasa officials and veteran flyer chuck yeager at his side then 
greeted the five crew members once they left the shuttle 
bush scheduled a rally in redding later today and also planned 
to spend tuesday in california a critical state where polls show 
the white house race dead even 
the fourday onehour flight of discovery was the first shuttle 
mission since challenger exploded in january 1986 killing its 
astronaut crew and schoolteacher passenger bush said last week it 
was great to be back in space with the shuttle and that the 
return was overdue 
the high visibility of the landing offered the gop nominee wide 
publicity in his contest with democrat michael dukakis following a 
quiet weekend at home for both candidates dukakis praised the 
landing from afar 
bush was asked last week if he would invite dukakis to join him 
at the shuttle landing he replied negatively saying such an 
invitation would politicize the event 
bush aides said he would be there by virtue of his office not 
as a candidate for the presidency but the shuttle stop puts bush 
in a position to continue his battle for californias 47 electoral 
votes 
both bush and dukakis are devoting substantial resources and 
time in the state where polls have shown the race a virtual dead 
heat 
the california trip comes on the heels of new reports about a 
matter that continues to dog bush his dealings with panamanian 
leader manuel antonio noriega who has been indicted in the united 
states on drug trafficking charges 
former cia chief stansfield turner said sunday that bush 
fostered close ties with noriega but he did not know whether the 
vice president played a role in reinstating the panamanian ruler to 
the cia payroll in the 1980s 
its not a coincidence that every time bush was in the 
government we were very friendly with the noriegas and the 
marcoses former philippine president ferdinand marcos and that 
ilk said turner who headed the agency in the carter 
administration and now supports dukakis 
turner in a telephone interview from new orleans said noriega 
was taken off the cia payroll after turner became director in march 
1977 but payments to noriega resumed during the reagan 
administration he said 
turner denied published reports that he had accused bush of 
instigating a resumption of cia payments to noriega

chad and libya would scrupulously respect the sept 11 1987 
ceasefire that ended the fighting in northern chad 
the agreement mediated by togolese president gnassingbe 
eyadema comes at a time when the mercurial gadhafi appears to be 
showing signs of some moderation at least with regard to his 
neighbors in north africa 
it also comes a year after habres forces in a series of 
lightning battles succeeded in driving he libyans out of northern 
chad after years of occupation in support of chadian rebels 
the statement did not mention the aouzou strip a 
44000squaremile band of territory across the northern border of 
chad that was seized by libya in 1973 the aouzou is he subject of 
a dispute going back to preworld war ii days before either chad or 
libya became independent 
in an interview with the associated press last month gadhafi 
said he was willing to negotiate the status of the aouzou 
we can negotiate he said it is a problem of borders if 
the united states and france get out of chad there is no problem 
they are using chad for their imperialist interests 
the french who have a 1200man intervenion force in chad 
welcomed the diplomatic move the french foreign ministry called it 
a decision that opens the way to peace and the establishment of 
neighborly relations between the libyan and chadian peoples 
defense minister jeanpierre chevenement said france would 
consult with chad before withdrawing the troops all stationed in 
the southern half of the country he noted the french presence is 
not there to stay forever and could be reinforced quickly from 
bases in neighboring central african republic 
some observers feel gadhafis less radical approach to foreign 
policy lately might be the result of the influence of omar 
almuntasser who became prime minister earlier this year 
one diplomat who has followed libyan affairs for years said 
gadhafi wants to give a more reasonable appearance to the outside 
world and often has followed the advice of the more moderate 
elements around him he realized his image was bad said the 
diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity 
gadhafi reestablished relations with tunisia in december 
ending a twoyear break caused when libya expelled more than 30000 
immigrant workers throwing them on to an already weak tunisian 
labor market 
a document outlining a new union between libya and algeria is 
now being discussed in both countries and is soon to be put to a 
referendum 
libya also is participating in discussions which many hope 
eventually will lead to a north african union involving libya 
tunisia algeria morocco and mauritania known as the maghreb or 
arab west 
on the home front gadhafi recently called for the abolition of 
the death penalty freed many political prisoners and loosened 
economic restrictions 
gadhafi began meddling in chadian affairs almost from the moment 
he took power in 1969 he started by arming and supplying northern 
rebels fighting the government in ndjamena and in 1973 seized 
the aouzou strip 
nearly every northern chadian leader has allied himself with 
gadhafi at one time or another including habre himself 
during his brief reign from 1980 to 1982 former president 
goukouni oueddei invited the libyans into the country they gladly 
accepted sending in 7000 men less than two years later however 
responding to international pressure over gadhafis plan to merge 
chad with libya goukouni ordered the libyans to leave and they 
withdrew to aouzou 
habre ousted goukouni in 1982 sending him fleeing to the north 
the following year the antigovernment forces began a drive on 
ndjamena 
after libyan troops became directly involved the french 
intervened to halt the advance france and to a lesser extent the 
united states have been habres main military and economic backers 
since he seized power in 1982

sharon knight is developing food that is out 
of this world 
using plastic growth chambers and carefully selected varieties 
the university of illinois horticulturist can produce crops like 
lettuce and rice faster than ordinary farmers the quickgrown 
vegetables could help feed people on 21stcentury space stations 
she says 
our goal is to produce the greatest amount of products in the 
shortest amount of time in the smallest space possible ms 
knight said in a recent interview 
her research begun at purdue university in 1979 is sponsored 
by the national aeronautics and space administration she is part 
of a scientific team working on the agencys controlled ecological 
life support system 
the idea is to develop the best varieties of crops like 
potatoes soybeans wheat lettuce and rice to be grown on space 
stations perhaps near the moon or mars 
the plants will serve two purposes they will recycle human 
waste used as fertilizer and they will convert carbon dioxide 
exhaled by the astronauts into oxygen they can breathe the plants 
also will produce the food for a nutritious vegetarian diet 
ms knight began by screening scores of lettuce varieties to 
find the one that would grow the fastest and produce the most food 
factors such as light temperature nutrition and atmosphere were 
carefully monitored and adjusted to find the ideal combination 
she found the best lettuce for space is waldmanns green 
started from tissue culture instead of seed and grown with its 
roots in nutrient solution instead of soil the crop can be 
harvested in just 19 days she said lettuce grown in the field 
takes nearly 60 days to mature 
ms knight next plans similar work with rice 
astronauts have visited ms knight and the other researchers to 
see how crops can be grown in space and to offer their suggestions 
since a diet of only a few vegetables could be boring ms 
knight said it will be the job of food engineers to convert some of 
them into tasty food bars or cakes providing more variety in 
appearance and flavor 
but lettuce likely would be served in its natural form as a 
salad because psychologically it will be nice to have something 
green to eat ms knight said 
one hundred square meters of vegetables probably would be 
necessary to feed each person she said computer control of the 
environment and robots to help with the work are likely she said 
if there were only four people on the space station theyd 
spend all their time raising crops so there will have to be some 
automation 
research remains to be done including using natural growth 
hormones to speed maturity and compensating for limited or zero 
gravity she said 
the work also could have terrestrial spinoffs said ms 
knight it may lead to expansion of crops grown in 
controlledenvironment agriculture especially increasing the 
potential for greenhouses to be located in arctic and arid regions 
of the world

three prominent activists 
encamped in the us consulate said in a letter published monday 
they will remain in their sanctuary to illustrate the pain of 
detention 
the antiapartheid leaders murphy morobe and mohanned valli 
moosa leaders of the banned united democratic front coalition and 
vusi khanyile chairman of the banned national education crisis 
committee have been at the johannesburg consulate since they 
escaped from detention sept 13 morobe and khanyile are black 
valli moosa is of indian descent 
each had been held more than a year without trial under the 
countrys state of emergency regulations 
the south african government has said the three are free to 
leave the consulate and will not be detained or restricted 
but the activists said they do not trust the government and 
repeated their call for the release of other political detainees 
one newspaper editorial suggested that we should call the 
governments bluff by walking out the three said in letter 
dated sept 28 and published monday in the sowetan which covers 
the main black township outside johannesburg 
we do not need to tempt the devil in order to merely prove he 
is evil they said we really see no virtue in handing 
ourselves over for another indefinite period in detention 
the men gave no indication of when they intended to leave the 
consulate 
we find no joy in spending 24 hours a day in the united states 
consulate boardroom the letter said however our escape and 
subsequent occupation of the consulate is meant to illustrate 
the pain of detention which hundreds around the country suffer 
an estimated 30000 people have been detained without trial for 
varying lengths of time under the 28monthold state of emergency 
about 1000 people currently are believed to be in detention most 
are being held for political activism 
an activist who escaped sept 21 to the us consulate clifford 
ngcobo left his refuge saturday to obtain medical treatment his 
law firm said 
ngcobo has filed a civil court action alleging police assaulted 
him and tortured him with electric shocks during the five months he 
was detained without being charged 
the government has said ngcobo will not be detained again but 
that he faces possible prosecution on a charge of illegal weapons 
possession

republican george bush surrounded by the jubilant discovery 
crew today proclaimed a great day for our country and democrat 
michael dukakis said he was thrilled by the space shuttles 
accomplishments as the prospects for a second presidential debate 
were thrown into doubt 
the league of women voters which was sponsoring the los 
angelesbased debate said today it was withdrawing and accused the 
bush and dukakis campaigns of manipulating the debate preparations 
league president nancy neuman told reporters in washington that 
the group refused to lend our trusted name to this charade 
democratic chairman paul kirk said the bipartisan party 
commission that sponsored the first debate could step into the 
leagues role and he warned the republicans not to use the 
leagues withdrawal as an excuse to dump the second debate the 
showdown had been scheduled oct 13 or 14 
they may try but i dont think they can they are committed 
to two presidential debates and the american people are well aware 
of that even if they tried to do an end run around it i dont 
think they can get out of it kirk said 
bush was asked whether he would attend a debate under different 
sponsorship and said i cant answer a hypothetical question 
bush was on hand as the astronauts landed the discovery at 
edwards air force base in california wasnt that great he 
said of the landing it was great a great day for our country 
bush inspected the shuttle with the crew posed for a thumbs 
up photograph with the astronauts and then saluted them 
dukakis interrupted his speech at the old statehouse in 
hartford conn to let the crowd know the shuttle had landed 
safely 
america is back in space the democrat said we are proud 
and we are thrilled at its achievements and the courage of that 
crew 
dukakis lectured elementary students in hartford conn today 
on the evils of drugs and told them if we are going to be the 
best then we are going to have to build a very strong future he 
also planned to be on the hand as officials destroyed an illegal 
drug cache in detroit later today 
the vice presidential hopefuls democrat lloyd bentsen and 
republican dan quayle spent the day preparing for their wednesday 
night debate in omaha neb 
quayle in a predebate interview with the associated press 
said that although the vice presidential encounter is important 
the determining factor for american voters is the candidate for the 
white house and the indiana senator will direct his attacks at 
the democratic nominee 
the opponent for me is michael dukakis hes the one thats 
running for president quayle said the senator from texas is 
the vice presidential nominee and my target and my discussion and 
my focus that evening will be on the governor from massachusetts 
meanwhile a statewide poll in heavilydemocratic maryland found 
the two candidates in a virtual dead heat with bush leading dukakis 
4844 percent the survey of 889 registered voters conducted for 
the baltimore sun monday through thursday had a margin of error of 
plus or minus 33 percentage points 
the vice presidential candidates cleared their campaign 
schedules to concentrate on the debate while workers at the civic 
auditorium in omaha readied the hall after a performance by a 
christian rock band and an exhibition by pro wrestlers 
the biggest task facing the crew according to city public 
events manager terry forsberg is decorating the candidates 
dressing rooms with carpeting and drapes 
theyll look like your living room or better yet theirs 
forsberg said 
quayle holed up with top advisers at an undisclosed location in 
the washington dc area and conducted mock debates with 
bentsens standin sen bob packwood rore 
the indiana senator said he was not concerned about possible 
gaffes during the debate a problem for the candidate during his 
campaign appearances 
the reason im not is because its going to be questions and 
answers theres always that possibility but im a very confident 
person he said 
republican strategists believe expectations remain low for 
quayles performance based on his miscues and reputation as a 
lightweight candidate but the indiana senator says he is not 
giving much consideration to expectations 
the american people will be able to see me in an unedited 
version for the first time since new orleans and its going to be 
a great opportunity for me he said 
bentsen meanwhile held a mock debate with quayle standin 
rep dennis eckart dohio and then flew to austin texas to 
devote his time to debate preparation 
in the mock session eckarts attacks sent staffers scurrying 
for research material and left bentsen a bit uncomfortable with 
the debate format 90 minutes of questions twominute responses 
and oneminute rebuttals 
he does not seem relaxed said bentsens spokesman mike 
mccurry if it were the senate floor hed be very comfortable and 
if it were the senate rules he would be very comfortable 
susan estrich dukakis campaign manager also downplayed 
expectations for the texas senator an oddson favorite based on 
his experience 
i have a lot of confidence in senator bentsen but dan quayle 
is a very effective debater she said

the kremlin long claimed antisemitism was a 
purely capitalist scourge that couldnt exist under socialism 
but the staterun press has thrown into doubt that official 
tenet and even suggested there may not have been much difference 
between josef stalin and adolf hitler on the question of 
antisemitism 
soviet doctrine for decades has maintained that the overthrow of 
capitalism in the 1917 russian revolution did away with the 
economic exploitation that fosters antisemitism 
one of the publications in the forefront of the glasnost 
campaign the weekly ogonyok recently published an expose on a 
grave near minsk that contained the remains of thousands of people 
shot as enemies of the people in the late 1930s under stalin 
ales adamovich who wrote the article said he had clashed with 
another author who tried to justify the actions of stalins secret 
police 
they believed my opponent stressed referring to the guards 
and the watchmen whose tower loomed over the head of all 170 
million people then the soviet population adamovich wrote 
well those who committed unthinkable atrocities in occupied 
byelorussia ukraine russia and the baltic states could they not 
also refer to their symbols of faith they could and thats how 
they justified themselves at the nuremberg trial 
another magazine the monthly literary journal oktyabr in its 
latest edition printed a passage from vitaly grossmans novel 
life and fate about the rise of state antisemitism 
oktyabr has been serializing grossmans masterwork a world war 
iiera historical novel long banned in the soviet union that 
sketches parallels between wartime russia and nazi germany and the 
ideological tyrannies of stalinism and nazism 
but reader viktor koretsky complained in a letter that a very 
important segment had been skipped over in the serialization the 
journals editors acknowledged that part of the novel had been 
omitted but did not explain why they then printed the missing 
2page fragment including these passages 
in the course of two millennia have there ever been occasions 
when the forces of freedom and humanitarianism made use of 
antisemitism as a tool in their struggles possibly but i do not 
know of them wrote grossman who died in 1964 
in contrast he said in totalitarian countries where society 
as such no longer exists there can arise state antisemitism 
the first stage of state antisemitism is discrimination the 
state limits the areas in which jews can live grossman wrote 
the second stage is wholesale destruction at a time when the 
forces of reaction enter a fatal struggle against the forces of 
freedom then antisemitism becomes an ideology of party and state 
as happened with fascism 
oktyabrs editors noted the segment follows chapters dealing 
with adolf eichmann the gestapo official who oversaw the 
annihilation of millions of jews and said grossman was describing 
the racist policy and ideology of fascism state antisemitism 
but the passage would appear to embrace antisemitism in 
official soviet life as well and in one place it mentions 
cosmopolitanism a charge used under stalin to persecute jewish 
authors artists and other figures after world war ii 
no other writer has so convincingly established the identity 
of nazism and soviet communism said grossmans englishlanguage 
translator robert chandler in a forward to the british edition of 
the novel the parallels between the two systems are drawn 
repeatedly 
soviet officialdom had little illusion about the explosiveness 
of the message contained in life and fate in 1960 grossman 
completed the 800page novel and submitted it to an official 
literary journal znamya it was returned with a rejection slip 
calling the work antisoviet 
kgb officers were sent to grossmans home with orders to 
confiscate not only the manuscript but even sheets of used carbon 
paper and typewriter ribbons when grossman appealed to the ruling 
politburo for the return of his manuscript kremlin ideologue 
mikhail a suslov reportedly told him there would be no question of 
life and fate being published for another 200 years 
the book has finally seen print in the soviet union because of 
mikhail s gorbachevs drive for glasnost or greater openness 
that has brought about a more candid examination of the countrys 
past

a federal liability trial over a 1985 
delta air lines crash that killed 137 people resumed monday after 
being in recess since early august 
at stake in the nonjury trial before us district judge david 
o belew jr is more than 100 million in claims from survivors and 
relatives of victims delta is trying to have the government pay 
part of the claims and the cost of replacing the lockheed l1011 
jet destroyed in the crash of flight 191 at dallasfort worth 
international airport 
if belew rules that the government should share blame in the 
tragedy a separate trial will determine how much the government 
should pay 
neither delta nor the government disputes that a violent 
downburst of air or microburst from a rapidly developing 
thunderstorm at the edge of the runway slammed the aircraft into 
the ground meteorologists say there is no known way to forecast a 
microburst 
delta claims a lack of communication between government air 
traffic controllers and meteorologists prevented the flight crew 
from getting the information they needed on the weather 
government lawyers argue the flight crew had the best view of 
the storm 
the recess was to accommodate the judges schedule 
delta attorneys have finished presenting their case 
likely upcoming witnesses for the government include gene 
skipworth the last flight controller to communicate with the 
flight 191 crew before the crash government attorney roy krieger 
said 
krieger said the government also plans to present pilot experts 
including an eastern airlines official who will testify about 
deltas pilot training programs 
attorneys said witnesses will be called to support the 
governments contention that capt edward m connors of the delta 
flight crew was heavily using prescription drugs about the time of 
the crash 
delta lawyers have disputed that claim

florida democrats choose a candidate 
tuesday to oppose republican rep connie mack iii for the seat 
being vacated by threeterm sen lawton chiles a democrat 
only about onefourth of the states voters are expected to show 
up for the election featuring a runoff between longtime rivals bill 
gunter 54 and rep kenneth buddy mackay 55 
its gunters third try for the senate and the second for 
mackay a former state legislator serving his third term in the 
us house 
gunter floridas insurance commissioner since 1976 
unsuccessfully sought his partys nomination in 1974 he won the 
democratic primary and runoff in 1980 before losing to republican 
paula hawkins in the general election 
mackay ran third in the 1980 primary 
both candidates engaged in negative campaigning to such an 
extent that state democratic chairman charles whitehead said it 
could cost the party the senate seat being vacated by chiles after 
18 years 
i certainly think what with what has gone on in the primary 
its going to make a tougher race for us to win than i would have 
liked to have had said whitehead 
mackay has made personal integrity an issue pointing to 
gunters taking campaign contributions from the industry he 
regulates and saying a 1986 fbi investigation cast a shadow over 
gunters performance as commissioner gunter says the investigation 
exonerated him 
in a state with a large jewish population gunter has questioned 
mackays support for israel mackay has angrily depicted this as

doctors who charge higher fees than the 
federal government considers reasonable billed their medicare 
patients 27 billion for the additional charges last year a 
statistical analysis showed monday 
that was spread among 703 million physician claims roughly 
onefourth of all submitted to medicare in fiscal 1987 and 
averaged 3811 in extra charges per billing 
medicare beneficiaries are required to pay 20 percent of the 
amount medicare deems reasonable and those copayments amounted to 
2599 for each of the 703 million claims that also contained what 
medicare calls excess billing 
adding the average medicare copayment to the average excess 
charge resulted in an average outofpocket expense of 6411 for 
each of the patient bills that exceeded the medicare standard 
the excessbilling claims came from the 63 percent of the 
nations doctors who have not agreed to abide by the fee schedules 
set by medicare 
the percentage of claims with excess charges ranged from 3 
percent in massachusetts where state law forbids excess billing 
to 51 percent in wyoming 
although federal health officials and congress have instituted a 
series of programs designed to encourage doctors to follow the 
medicare scale there is no national rule requiring them to do so 
the percentage of physicians who voluntarily follow the medicare 
fee schedule ranges from 735 percent in alabama to 149 percent in 
idaho 
despite the state law keeping doctors from collecting excess 
charges from their medicare patients only 459 percent of 
massachusetts doctors have voluntarily agreed to be listed on 
medicares roster of participating physicians who accept 
assignment 
a physician who accepts assignment charges only the fee that 
medicare deems reasonable and proper considering his or her bill 
fully paid after collecting 20 percent from the patient and 80 
percent from medicare 
with physician net income 10 times that of the elderly its 
not too much to ask that all doctors accept the rates medicare sets 
for reimbursement as full payment from all medicare patients 
said robert m brandon vice president of citizen action a 
consumer group that released the study 
thats why we support national legislation prohibiting excess 
charges voluntary efforts on the federal and state levels have not 
worked well enough even when they have included incentives 
citizen action which claims 17 million members based its 
survey on records maintained by the health care and financing 
administration the agency that manages medicare fiscal 1987 was 
the last year for which full statistics are available fiscal 1988 
ended only last friday and all the bills are not in for the most 
recent 12month federal budget year 
the citizen action analysis showed that the doctors who treat 
medicare patients received an average income of about 60000 in 
fiscal 1987 just from those patients that included the 80 percent 
paid by medicare and the enrollees 20 percent share of 
reasonable charges 
doctors who are not participating physicians those who can 
bill patients excess charges receive on average an additional 
7400 per year in excess charges to seniors the study said

the annual conference of the 
opposition labor party endorsed on monday key proposals to tone 
down leftwing policies in a bid to end nearly a decade of 
conservative party government 
leftists already soundly defeated in a bid to oust labor leader 
neil kinnock accused him of ditching cherished socialist 
principles after three successive election defeats by prime 
minister margaret thatcher 
the review the first stage of a twoyear process includes 
dropping a commitment to renationalize all stateowned industries 
sold by mrs thatcher and also accepts some of her drastic curbs on 
the powers of labor unions 
we dont have to cling to the past terrified to move 
labors election campaign manager bryan gould told more than 
1000 delegates at the winter gardens conference center in this 
north england resort 
there is a bright socialist future for this party and this 
country if only we have the courage to think for it gould said 
a succession of leftwing speakers denounced the policy review 
document social justice and economic efficiency which 
stresses the role of capitalism while promising greater state 
control of the economy 
to cheers from supporters miners leader arthur scargill a 
promarxist said the new policies were a clear departure from 
the basic principles and traditions of our party 
i didnt join this party to have a yuppieland approach to run 
capitalism better than the tories said scargill i joined this 
party to change this society and create a socialist alternative 
delegate matt wrack described the document as a pompous 
selfimportant mendacious load of drivel 
kinnock ordered the review after labors last election defeat in 
1987 
the new proposals released last spring also stipulate tax rate 
ceilings of 50 percent to 60 percent compared with 86 percent 
under the last labor administration which lost power in 1979 
the proposals are the first stage of a twoyear process the 
rest of the review including the partys controversial pledge to 
scrap nuclear weapons unilaterally is due to be published next 
spring with final decisions made on the whole package at labors 
1989 convention 
the next election must be held by 1992 but it is likely in 1991 
labors constitution still has a basic marxiststyle tenet 
adopted in 1918 which calls for common ownership of the means of 
production distribution and exchange kinnock and his top aides 
insist that a mixed economy of private and state control does not 
conflict with the tenet known as clause 4 
under the new policies a labor government would only 
nationalize giant utilities such as british gas sold by mrs 
thatcher she plans also to sell the national electricity utility 
but the rest which include british airways a national freight 
service jaguar cars and the states remaining share in british 
petroleum would be left in private hands one in seven voters has 
bought shares in the big tory government sales alone 
kinnock plans to use his resounding defeat of a leadership 
challenge by leftist tony benn as a mandate to press on with what 
he calls a party platform based on realism 
in a ballot sunday night kinnock won 88 percent support from an 
electoal college consisting of labor union leaders the partys 228 
members in the 650seat house of commons and local party branches 
the labor party was founded by the trade unions at the turn of 
the century and they continue to fund it benn pledged to fight on 
and maintained kinnocks tactics would not win the next election

politicians sought agreement monday on a measure to 
limit secret voting in parliament in a bid to stave off a possible 
government crisis 
a vote is expected in the chamber of deputies later this week 
and political analysts said premier ciriaco de mitas 6monthold 
coalition government hangs in the balance 
since the vote itself will be secret politicians see the 
possibility of snipers those who vote against their own party 
as being a determining factor 
if the proposal is rejected there is no doubt mr de mita will 
resign said francesco donofrio a constitutional expert for de 
mitas christian democrat party 
italy is one of the few western democracies where most 
parliamentary votes are secret and rollcalls are taken only on 
votes of confidence the practice has been blamed in part for the 
chronic instability of italian governments 
de mitas predecessor fellow christian democrat giovanni goria 
resigned as head of italys 47th postwar government in march after 
losing a series of secret votes his seven months in office were 
plagued by political infighting 
the same five parties that had made up gorias government agreed 
in april to reform the coalition under de mita by placing limits on 
the secret ballot 
they agreed the secrecy would only be retained for questions 
involving fundamental liberties or for issues of conscience such as 
genetic manipulation or abortion but some members of parliament 
have had second thoughts viewing the secret vote as the only way 
to keep some degree of freedom from the tight party discipline 
foreign minister giulio andreotti a powerful christian 
democrat took some distance from de mita last week when he said 
parliament shouldnt exaggerate any changes and should consider 
limiting open voting to financial questions 
a series of amendments to limit open voting have been tacked on 
to the original coalition government proposal and the chamber of 
deputies will vote on these 
mario usellini a christian democrat said in a newspaper 
interview that about 10 percent of the 630 members of the chamber 
of deputies are inclined to break party discipline but would be 
afraid to do so if most votes were open 
they are deputies with a weak position in their party and feel 
most exposed because they fear expulsion from the party and an 
electoral boycott he told milans corriere della sera 
the secret vote also is believed to help special interests 
since no voting records can be kept

investigators have found 140 more wild 
horses apparently fatally shot in remote central nevada bringing 
to 268 the number found dead in the area the bureau of land 
management said monday 
the horses were discovered about 10 miles north of a site where 
authorities had found 41 horses slain and 40 miles north of an area 
where 87 horses had been shot said bob stewart a spokesman for 
the federal agency 
in all three cases stewart said the carcasses and bones 
indicate the horses died over a sixmonth period starting about a 
year ago 
and while blm investigators havent stated yet that the earlier 
shootings and the latest deaths are connected id be surprised 
if theres not a connection stewart said 
stewart added he didnt know if there was any link between the 
central nevada horse killings and reported shootings of several 
wild horses at silverpeak in southern nevada 
the bureau of land management has increased surveillance of the 
rangeland it controls in nevada following the discovery in august 
of the 41 slain horses the second group of horses was found after 
the agency got a tip from an unidentified person being questioned 
about the first killings 
a helicopter crew made the latest find in an area about 30 miles 
north of austin and ground crews were to go to the isolated area 
to confirm the cause of death stewart said 
terri jay director of the nevada commission for the 
preservation of wild horses has said rewards totaling 12000 are 
being offered for information leading to the arrest and conviction 
of anyone involved in the shootings 
more than 38000 wild horses run the open range of 10 western 
states up from about 17000 when congress decided in 1971 to make 
it a crime to harrass or kill wild horses on public lands 
nevadas wild horse herds are among the largest in the west 
with estimates of up to 28000 of the animals roaming the state 
at the turn of the century there were some 2 million wild 
horses in the west but they were relentlessly hunted and 
slaughtered for pet food and glue

will be freed later today and handed over to the us ambassador to 
syria the syrian foreign minister said 
the foreign minister farouk alshara told a midday news 
conference at the united nations he had good news for the 
american people 
one of the american hostages will be released within one hour 
from now he can be released any minute 
he spoke shortly after 1 pm edt there had been no report of 
any hostage freed as of two hours later 
kidnappers holding three american professors and one indian 
educator said today they will free one hostage at the west beirut 
headquarters of the un relief and works agency for palestinian 
refugees 
the announcement from islamic jihad for the liberation of 
palestine came in a 36word handwritten statement in arabic 
delivered to a western news agency in beirut 
the syrian foreign minister said the hostage whose name he said 
he did not know will be released in lebanon where he was 
kidnapped and the syrian security forces will bring him to 
damascus to hand him over to the american ambassador 
nbc news and cbs news and in beirut the voice of lebanon radio 
station reported that alann steen 49 of boston was being 
released state department officials said they could not confirm 
the report 
steens wife virginia told the associated press in a telephone 
interview that she had talked with the state department hours 
earlier 
were just waiting and watching like everybody else 
theres nothing confirmed yet she said 
president reagan asked during a picturetaking session if he 
thought a hostage was about to be released replied 
its hard to tell with what little information we have as far 
as we know no hostages has been released yet we have no word on 
that 
earlier presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the united 
states had been told by another government that a hostage held by 
iranian sympathizers was being released imminently 
fitzwater said us government officials received reports 
this morning that a hostage would be set free and said that the 
reports came from a thirdparty government in the region 
at the state department an official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the latest report came from the islamic jihad 
through the syrian government 
he said that was the group holding four american educators and 
any release was likely to come from those four hostages a total of 
nine americans are held hostage in lebanon 
the four educators believed held by islamic jihad all captured 
jan 24 1987 are 
steen a journalism professor at beirut university college 
jesse turner a visiting professor at the school robert pohill an 
assistant business professor and mithileswar singh an indian 
citizen holding resident alien status in the united states 
nearly four months after they were taken captive turner said in 
a videotape released by islamic jihad that steen was suffering from 
high blood pressure was in pitiful health and was expected to 
die at any moment despite being under a doctors care 
at the white house fitzwater said we have received reports 
that a hostage would be released the presidential spokesman 
said but we have not received a name and i cannot comment any 
further he said he did not know if the hostage purportedly to be 
released is an american 
during his daily white house news briefing fitzwater said the 
tip off to a hostage release was relayed to us officials in 
washington by an american embassy overseas 
last friday reagan while on a campaign trip to chicago denied 
that the administration was steeped in negotiations with iranian 
officials in geneva aimed at securing the release of at least five 
american hostages by oct 7 as a report published in israel held 
earlier in the week however the president during a meeting in 
new york with representatives of persian gulf states told 
reporters he was optimistic about the hostage situation he also 
said however that he didnt want to talk about it 
in beirut on saturday kidnappers holding three american 
educators and an indian professor said they would release one 
hostage as a goodwill gesture 
the group the islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
did not say in its statement which of the hostages it would free 
or when 
fitzwater said our situation is the same our policy is the 
same no deals no quid pro quos 
first of all we need to wait and see that it does happen 
he said noting that we have had some similar kinds of reports in 
the past that fell through there is a concern in the 
sense that we dont know what their motives are in any of these 
actions 
in an interview published today the spiritual leader of an 
umbrella group for kidnappers holding foreign hostages said he 
thought the problem was nearing an end 
when the hostage question shifts to highlevel talks between 
big powers and they start speaking of deadlines that means the 
question is nearing its end sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah 
spiritual head of hezbollah was quoted as saying in the weekly 
monday morning magazine 
the christian almarkazia news agency carried advance excerpts 
of the interview on sunday 
hezbollah or party of god is believed to be the umbrella group 
for kidnappers holding most of the 17 foreign hostages in lebanon 
besides the four taken prisoner in january 1987 these americans 
are also held hostage in lebanon

democrat lloyd bentsen tossed a football 
and declared himself relaxed and ready monday for his vice 
presidential debate with republican dan quayle 
well talk about the issues those that are facing america 
and get away from some of these slogans the texas senator told 
reporters during a break outside the hotel where he is preparing 
for the wednesday night confrontation in omaha neb 
formal rehearsals for the debate were being videotaped in an 
empty restaurant next door to bentsens hotel campaign aides set 
up two lecterns a table for the panelists and a dark backdrop to 
duplicate debate conditions with rep dennis eckart dohio 
playing the role of quayle 
bentsen scheduled no campaign events until tuesday when he will 
attend a rally before he flies to omaha his only public appearance 
monday was when he emerged from his hotel for a game of catch 
football with former university of texas players who included 1969 
quarterback james street 
i think were relaxed for it i think were ready for it 
bentsen said was he nervous im not nervous he said 
bentsen 67 joked about the differences in age and physical 
appearance between himself and the telegenic quayle 41 
he said that when michael dukakis asked him to join the 
democratic ticket he quipped to his wife ba i hope he 
doesnt just want another pretty face 
she said lloyd dream on dream on he said 
bentsen spent the morning in meetings with a dozen aides before 
he headed to the mockdebate studio in the afternoon his advisers 
included people from his texas entourage and dukakis campaign 
headquarters 
i think hes obviously going to be wellprepared for this 
experience said george christian former press secretary to 
president johnson and a longtime bentsen associate 
most people have already decided that bentsen is more 
qualified than quayle and i dont really believe that is the issue 
of this debate he said 
i dont think this is going to be quaylebashing debate 
christian said adding that he expected quayle to perform well 
instead he said bentsen needed to attack republican distortions 
of such issues as crime and gun control 
the bush campaign has used a campaign of distortion to attempt 
to paint gov dukakis as a wildeyed northeastern liberal and here 
in texas that has hurt christian said sen bentsen is one of 
the better democrats available to answer that sort of thing 
texas has 29 electoral votes third highest of any state and 
despite bentsens presence on the ticket the democrats are trailing 
in the polls 
susan estrich the dukakisbentsen campaign manager said the 
staff was trying to help bentsen express his achievements and 
experience in concise ways that fit the format of the 90minute

a crowd of 425000 people 
the secondlargest ever to watch a space shuttle land cheered 
proudly monday as discovery dropped from a deepblue desert sky and 
gently touched down on a dusty lake bed 
about 410000 people had funneled cars motor homes trailers 
and trucks down a twolane road to a public viewing area to witness 
the completion of the first shuttle mission since challenger 
exploded 32 months ago an additional 15000 watched from a vip 
viewing area 
it sends chills up my spine 26yearold steve bestwick of 
port hueneme said as two sonic booms reverberated across rogers dry 
lake at 934 am three minutes before the touchdown 
then the gleaming whiteoverblack discovery appeared from the 
west and made a fast turn high overhead 
bestwick marveled at how quickly it plummeted to the hardpacked 
floor of the mojave desert 
thats beautiful but geez its so steep he said 
i had goosebumps all over said diane bonds who traveled 
600 miles from roy utah i have always wanted to see one of 
these and now i have 
the vehicles many displaying american flags started gathering 
sunday beside the 44squaremile lake bed in the mojave desert 80 
miles north of los angeles some had license pates from states as 
distant as florida 
most of the shuttle watchers felt discoverys safe return would 
reinvigorate americas manned space program which had been 
virtually paralyzed following the challenger disaster 
i certainly hope it does said betty davis 66 of goleta 
we need to spend our money on this its exciting and patriotic 
after the landing most viewers sprinted for their vehicles 
which threw a huge cloud of talcum powderlike dust into the air as 
they crowded toward the single exit gate out of the parking area 
the twolane blacktop highway is the only road leading away from 
the viewing site 
air force spokesman lt col george neiss said 109000 vehicles 
carried an estimated 410000 people to the public viewing site by 
monday morning 
only one larger crowd had ever gathered to watch a shuttle land 
an estimated 500000 for the shuttle columbia on july 4 1982 when 
president and mrs reagan greeted the astronauts 
ellery sabin 66 who had traveled from ludington mich 
perched atop his 33foot motor home and surveyed the recreational 
vehicles tents cars and trucks stretching across the desert 
dotted with bizarrely twisted joshua trees 
this is crazy he exclaimed ive been around crowds but 
this is really something 
theres such a sense of pride here sabin said we need to 
continue with the space program i dont like to see them throw 
taxpayer money away on a lot of things but this is certainly worth 
it

a convicted racketeer was sentenced monday 
to 20 years in prison for his involvement in a network of massage 
parlors that were transformed into houses of prostitution 
the trial turned over a lot of rocks in the quiet community and 
shocked many residents 
william j evers 49 will be eligible for parole in seven 
years he faced a maxiumum of 313 years in prison 
outagamie county circuit judge dennis luebke who gave evers 
credit for 18 months of presentence confinement criticized him 
for continuing to be involved in the massage parlor business after 
being sentenced to prison on related charges 
at a preliminary hearing a judge blamed the community for the 
prostitution problem 
none of it would have been possible without the patronage of 
the people of the fox river valley reserve judge albert twesme 
of galesville said they are the ones who made all this 
despicable behavior possible it was they who made these activities 
lucrative 
twesme said he had been shocked by testimony that some of the 
prostitutes were busiest after sunday church services 
reading from a statement prior to sentencing evers said he 
regretted his actions for the past five years especially their 
impact on his wife anita 
i apologize to the court the community and especially my 
family he said 
theres no doubt that mr evers is a man of great 
intelligence a natural born leader of people he views himself as 
a superior human being a player that dictates to society and 
individuals that are weaker than himself prosecutor john des 
jardins said 
des jardins said rehabilitation was an impossibility for mr 
evers at this point in effect it almost becomes a hobby for mr 
evers to try to outwit society 
on july 23 a jury convicted evers of 23 felony charges and one 
misdemeanor 
evers was convicted of three counts of racketeering two counts 
of allowing the continued use of a place of prostitution 18 counts

moslem guerrillas fired rockets into 
the afghan city of kandahar that killed 13 people radio kabul 
reported monday 
the radio said a military correspondent with the official afghan 
bakhtar news agency said another 22 people were injured in the 
attack on residential areas of the southern city over the weekend 
soviet troops left kandahar on aug 15 as part of the withdrawal 
of an estimated 100000 red army soldiers under an accord signed in 
geneva the pullout of the troops which invaded afghanistan in 
1979 to support the marxist government is to be completed by feb 
15 
both the soviets and the afghans have accused pakistan of 
violating the geneva agreement by harboring and arming moslem 
guerrillas 
pakistan has charged the sovietbacked afghan government with 
violating its airspace more than 150 times since the may 15 accord 
was signed 
radio kabul said the afghan government filed a complaint with 
pakistans representative in kabul charging pakistan with 
supporting a guerrilla attack on asadabad in the northeastern 
province of kunar eight people died in that attack which radio

guerrilla operation on the road between kabul and the city of 
jalalabad 75 miles from the pakistan border the rebels said 
sunday 
japanese embassy officials in islamabad said they also had 
received the report but were unable to confirm it 
if correct ms nanjo would be at least the sixth western 
journalist killed while covering the 9yearold war between moslem 
insurgents and sovietbacked afghan government troops

construction spending fell 06 percent in 
august the government said monday and economists blamed the 
lackluster performance on rising interest rates and previous 
overbuilding in many regions 
the commerce department said building activity declined to a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3961 billion in august 
following a revised 07 percent gain in july the july figure had 
been preliminarily reported as a strong 12 percent gain 
for the first eight months of the year activity was up only 04 
percent over the same period in 1987 failing even to keep pace 
with the 14 percent increase in construction costs 
michael sumichrast an economist in washington who publishes a 
construction newsletter cited five reasons for the sluggishness 
rising interest rates the effects of the 1986 tax law high land 
prices a nogrowth movement on the west coast and the lack of 
public spending on sewerage water systems and other public works 
needed to support building 
despite rising interest rates in august strength in housing 
particularly singlefamily homes partly offset weakness in most 
other areas 
residential construction overall was up 07 percent to 1908 
billion bolstered by a 10 percent jump in construction of 
singlefamily units to 1156 billion and a 05 percent rise in 
apartment construction to 220 billion 
construction of commercial buildings including shopping centers 
was down 60 percent to 268 billion in august 
factory construction dropped for the third consecutive month it 
fell 31 percent to the lowest level since april 1987 activity in 
this sector had been rising earlier this year as manufacturers 
increased capacity to meet a boom in export sales 
government construction projects fell 21 percent to 775 
billion and included a 127 percent drop in highway construction 
construction of office buildings in august rose 04 percent to 
281 billion 
mark obrinsky an economist with the us league of savings 
institutions said demand for office space in the northeast and the 
washington dc area is somewhat offsetting the lack of activity 
in states such as texas where many nowvacant office buildings 
were constructed based on the assumption that oil prices would stay 
high 
hotel and motel construction was up 30 percent to 67 billion

the financial health of the nations hospitals is 
taking a turn for the worse which could lead to more hospital 
closings and a decline in the quality of patient care an industry 
group said monday 
the main cause of the hospitals financial woes is 
lessthanadequate payments under government medicare and medicaid 
programs said the healthcare financial management association 
citing a survey of 1400 hospitals there are about 7000 hospitals 
in the country 
the first thing we need is to have a payment policy for 
medicaid and medicare services that is rational said association 
president richard l clarke we feel that it is currently unfair 
to hospitals 
we believe government and employers must make decisions 
for payment of health care services which meet the financial needs 
of hospitals that conscientiously manage their costs he said 
under changes that took effect in october 1983 medicare pays a 
set amount for a given service or treatment the schedule was set 
by congress in an effort to curb sharply escalating healthcare 
costs and reduce federal budget deficits 
clarke said that move has resulted in more patients being 
treated at outpatient clinics and walkin surgical centers and a 
decline in hospital occupancy rates 
i think what well find in the future is that more hospitals 
will close others will eliminate unprofitable services such as 
emergency rooms and others will have no ability to borrow money to 
replace aging plant and equipment said clarke 
the organization for financial managers of hospitals and other 
businesses in the healthcare field has 26000 members 
a spokesman for the us health care finance administration 
which administers the medicare governmentinsurance program used 
primarily by senior citizens declined to comment specifically on 
the report saying he had not seen it 
but spokesman robert hardy said medicare payment rates for 
hospitals are fair and realistic 
there were rate increases of 29 percent to 39 percent on oct 
1 he said noting the boosts varied depending on location 
basically medicare was put into business not to make sure 
that every country in the hospital makes a profit but to make 
sure that senior citiizens get quality health care hardy said 
he suggested a major factor in hospitals financial problems is 
too many beds citing nationwide occupancy rates averaging only 
about 60 percent 
clarke acknowledged a nationwide surplus of hospital beds 
but he said hospitals that will be forced out of business for 
purely financial reasons are probably the ones needed most in 
poorer sections of urban areas and in rural areas 
last year a record 79 hospitals closed around the country half 
in inner cities and half in rural areas according to the american 
hospital association fortynine hospitals closed in 1985 and 71 in 
1986 
profit margins among the hospitals surveyed fell from 29 
percent in 1986 to 24 percent in 1987 a decline of 172 percent 
according to the associations hospital industry financial report 
for 198387 
the study said standard and poors reports during the past five 
years show that 22 percent of all hospital credit ratings have been 
lowered while 5 percent have been raised 
unless the financial trend is reversed hospitals could be 
hard pressed to meet the health care needs of the future and 
there could be an overall decline in the quality of patient care 
clarke said

the drivers who haul stars equipment and 
props for television and movie producers went on strike monday the 
second time this year the entertainment industry has been strained 
by a labor dispute 
unions representing electricians and laborers also authorized 
strikes against producers on monday said earl bush 
secretarytreasurer of teamsters local 399 he estimated about 
3200 workers were on strike 
producers stung already by a 22week strike by scriptwriters 
that ended in august vowed their movie and television production 
schedules would not be disrupted again and hired replacement 
drivers no new talks were scheduled 
the hollywood plumbers and plasterers unions did not join the 
protest and hollywoods talent unions actors writers and 
directors have contract clauses that forbid them from honoring 
the picket lines of other unions 
teamsters were hoping that drivers who belong to locals that 
arent striking the producers would still honor picket lines and 
refrain from making deliveries to studios 
the strike was called after weekend negotiations which were 
ordered by a federal mediator collapsed the union voted 1441196 
on thursday to reject the contract proposal submitted by the 
alliance of motion picture and television producers 
key issues dividing the two sides include overtime rules for 
weekend work salary rates wages for outoftown film and 
television production and guidelines for making nonunion films 
some teamster drivers are being asked to take a pay cut from 1661 
to 14 per hour 
about two dozen pickets marched monday in front of the hollywood 
boulevard offices of producer stephen j cannell drivers also 
picketed the cannell production hunter the nbctv show was 
shooting on location at the santa monica pier 
bush blamed the producers for the impasse 
we have attempted to cooperate every way possible not to have 
a strike he said can we stop production i guess thats 
something were going to have to wait to see 
in a separate news conference j nicholas counter president of 
the alliance said the teamsters demands were unreasonable in an 
era of higher production costs 
weve been very flexible in attempting to achieve our goals 
counter said these issues are as important to us as the issues 
in the writers strike 
counter said replacement drivers would have no problem filling 
work requirements we will continue to produce counter said 
we will operate today we will operate tomorrow 
bush said the teamsters had offered to extend the contract that 
expired on july 31 for one year but the producers refused he 
claimed the producers bargaining position reflected an attempt to 
break the union 
counter denied that producers were engaged in any unionbusting 
tactics we will gain control of our costs counter said and 
thats not unionbusting were trying to create more union jobs 
bush said he did not know when talks would resume or how long 
the strike might last the next move is up to the federal 
mediator

the transportation department on monday set 
fueleconomy standards for 1989 passenger cars at 265 miles per 
gallon of gasoline a level the nations two largest automakers say 
they could meet without layoffs and production cuts 
the departments decision kept the fuel economy average required 
for each auto manufacturer from increasing to the 275 mpg enacted 
by congress in 1975 since 1986 the automakers have been required 
to meet a 26 mpg standard 
a higher requirement would have clearly put our domestic 
fullline manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage compared to 
some foreign manufacturers especially the asians who have been 
building only small cars and can easily meet the fueleconomy 
requirements said transportation secretary jim burnley 
the order issued by the national highway traffic safety 
administration an agency within the transportation department 
said 265 mpg represented the level attainable by general motors 
corp and ford motor co in their domestic fleets of passenger cars 
without harmful production restrictions and without any 
significant restrictions on consumer choice 
thus no job or sales losses should result from gm and ford 
as well as the manufacturers of most foreign vehicles sold in this 
country meeting the standard indeed that standard should help 
preserve the ability of the two domestic companies to recapture 
sales and jobs from competitors the nhtsa order said 
gm and ford which had warned higher fueleconomy standards 
would force cutbacks of bigcar production and cost the industry 
hundreds of thousands of jobs were quick to praise the order 
consumer groups were critical 
gm said the decision was in the best interest of american 
workers and consumer choice the company said the 1975 law that 
established the corporate average fuel economy or cafe standards 
was outdated 
ford said the agencys decision recognizes that consumer 
preferences resulting from low fuel prices have placed a 
particularly heavy burden on our efforts to comply with the 275 
mpg standard 
the nations thirdlargest automaker chrysler corp whose car 
line is concentrated in the smaller more fuelefficient models 
said only that it would exceed 275 mpg in 1989 and said a 
meaningful gasoline tax would eliminate the need for a cafelike 
regulatory system 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca has argued that his company has 
successfully met the fueleconomy level set by congress and federal 
regulators should not change the rules to help companies that have 
been less successful in making fuelefficient cars 
the center for auto safety which favors stricter fueleconomy 
standards said through director clarence ditlow that the 
transportation departments decision was another cavein by the 
reagan administration and vowed to go to court to try to force 
the agency to let the standard increase to 275 mpg 
other critics such as sen timothy wirth dcolo and the 
energy conservation coalition called for higher standards to 
reduce the release of gases into the atmosphere arguing that 
automotive emissions contribute to a longterm warming of the 
earths atmosphere through the greenhouse effect 
as the evidence mounts that the earth is getting warmer and 
may experience unprecedented temperature increases the us should 
be improving automobile efficiency to reduce greenhouse 
emissions wirth said 
the reagan administration gm and ford contend that the 
fueleconomy standards enacted to reduce petroleum imports have 
outlived their usefulness 
with gasoline prices now running about 1 a gallon across the 
nation the need to conserve is less pressing than it was in the 
mid1970s and consumers want to buy larger cars the administration 
and the automakers say 
nhtsas decision coincided with release of a public opinion poll 
concluding that 90 percent of americans believe the government 
should require the automakers to build more fuelefficient cars 
the telephone poll of 1000 registered voters sept 1014 was 
conducted for the communications consortium a public relations 
firm representing environmental groups the margin of error was 
about three percentage points

prime minister sadek elmahdi and rebel 
leader john garang will begin peace talks aimed at ending a 
5yearold civil war that has displaced thousands of people in 
sudan a newspaper reported monday 
the englishlanguage daily sudan times said the meeting probably 
would be held late this month in kampala capital of neighboring 
uganda 
elmahdi received a message last week from garang expressing the 
rebel leaders willingness to start negotiations the newspaper 
said the message was delivered through ugandan president yoweri 
museveni it said 
if held the meeting would be the second between elmahdi and 
the former army officer who in 1983 launched a rebellion in 
southern sudan against the moslemdominated government a june 1986 
meeting in ethiopias capital addis ababa failed to end the 
fighting 
garangs sudan peoples liberation army claims control over most 
of the southern countryside while government forces dominate large 
towns and cities 
the rebels mostly animists and christians demand the 
government grant them more autonomy and initiate economic reforms 
but some refugees have accused the guerrillas of taking their 
crops and cattle and recruiting their young people 
about 600 people fleeing the civil war in the countryside took 
refuge in a town where thousands are fighting malnutrition and 
diseases the sudan news agency reported today the new refugees 
recently arrived in the town of elmuglad about 460 miles south of 
khartoum which already is home to 5000 people who escaped the 
fierce battles between the rebels and government the agency 
reported it did not give the exact date of the refugees arrival 
half a dozen people were dying every day in elmuglad from 
spreading diseases caused by malnutrition the agency said 
since 1983 about 820000 people have left their homes in 
southern sudan as a result of the civil war some settled in 
governmentcontrolled towns and cities while others wandered north 
to khartoum and eastwards into ethiopia this summer at least 
8000 people died of starvation while fleeing the war 
elmeiram another town 500 miles south of khartoum houses 
about 20000 refugees under conditions of malnutrition and disease 
the agency said about 2550 people had died in elmeiram between 
june and august the agency said 
tensions were mounting in the town because thousands of arab 
tribesmen and their cattle were expected to arrive there soon 
swelling the size of the town to about 70000 people the agency 
said 
the united states and other donor governments have recently 
succeeded in moving large quantities of food and other supplies 
into the sudan after months of difficulties that had frustrated 
relief agencies according to jay f morris deputy administrator 
of the us agency for international development arrangenments are 
being made for the agency to provide l5 million to the sudan 
governments relief and rehabilitation commission according to 
deputy spokesman phyllis oakley 
morris said that on sept 25 the guerrillas tried and failed to 
shoot down a transport plane carrying us supplies from khartoum 
to the city of juba he said the rebels also have threatened to 
shoot down flights headed for aweil where 100 deaths a day from 
starvation have been reported 
we deplore these outrageous actions which target trucks and 
planes that are undertaking humanitarian missions mrs oakley 
said 
last month mauris lawya the governor of equatoria province 
said a convoy of 912 trucks bound for juba under army escort had to 
return to yie because of rebel attacks he added that in another 
convoy only 96 out of 1080 trucks were able to to reach juba 750 
miles south of the capital 
the rebels fear the government will use relief convoys to bring 
reinforcements to areas the rebels control which they claim 
include 90 percent of the countryside in the south

this financially strapped city is 
keeping its promise to replace houses destroyed in july when a 
790000gallon water tank collapsed and released a wall of water 
downhill into a poor neighborhood 
the july 22 flash flood killed three people injured more than 
20 and destroyed at least 13 adobe and wood homes cars furniture 
and parts of houses were washed to the bottom of the slope 
the next day mayor jaime bermudez visited the neighborhood and 
promised the city would provide medical care and replace everything 
that could be replaced 
two months later the city is erecting cinderblock replacement 
houses 
the flood forced the city to build me a new home which is 
better than what i had elida molina said last week our new 
home is going to have an indoor bathroom a separate kitchen and a 
bedroom we had only one room before things are looking bright 
now 
but her enthusiasm is tempered 
three boys that i knew were killed she said they can 
never be replaced 
the water was released when a 75footlong wall of the concrete 
water tank gave way officials believe heavy rain might have

the supreme court on monday agreed to decide 
whether federal courts have the authority to force lawyers to 
represent in noncriminal cases people too poor to pay for legal 
help 
the justices said they will hear the appeal of john e mallard 
of fairfield iowa who was ordered to represent prison inmates in 
a suit charging prison officials with mistreatment and other 
misconduct 
two current inmates and one former inmate at the iowa state 
penitentiary in fort madison said prison guards and officials filed 
false disciplinary reports against them physically mistreated them 
and endangered their lives by revealing they were informants 
a federal judge picked mallard from a list of lawyers to 
represent the three because they are too poor to hire attorneys 
mallard sought to be excused on grounds he lacked experience in 
trial cases and that the federal courts lacked the power to require 
an unwilling attorney to represent someone who requests a lawyer in 
a civil case 
courts routinely assign lawyers to represent indigent defendants 
in criminal cases and the lawyers are paid at taxpayer expense 
generally a fraction of what they would receive normally 
in civil rights cases like the one in the case acted on monday 
lawyers are paid expenses and may be paid a part of any damages won 
by their clients 
us district judge harold d vietor denied mallards motion to 
be excused from the inmates suit 
mallard can hardly claim incompetence when he has filed an 
18page brief in support of this motion that demonstrates thorough 
research careful reasoning and effective writing vietor said 
despite his renunciation of any claim to being a litigator 
mallard does have litigation experience mallard is not 
incompetent 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals upheld vietors decision 
last december 
the iowa attorney generals office urged the supreme court to 
reject mallards appeal the office acknowledged that it is a 
hardship for lawyers to be forced to take cases without being paid 
a fee 
but the attorney generals office said the attorney 
appointment process spreads the risk of that hardship makes 
more efficient and effective the utilization of practicing 
attorneys and is soundly rooted in the ethical obligation of each 
the case is mallard vs us district court 871490

farmers began signing up for payments monday 
under a 39 billion benefits package to aid victims of the drought 
that hammered the nations croplands over the summer 
the telephones have been real busy all morning with calls from 
people asking for appointments said james anderson director of 
the agricultural stabilization and conservation service ascs 
office in brown county sd 
the agriculture department agency is in charge of parceling out 
aid under the program president reagan signed into law on aug 11 
to offset losses among farmers from a drought that reduced the us 
harvest an estimated 31 percent 
brisk business was reported at ascs offices in the nothern grain 
belt where blistering sun and scarce rainfall wrecked the spring 
wheat crop in most places though there was no stampede on the 
first day of a lengthy signup period that ends in march 
across the midcontinent many farmers were still in their fields 
harvesting what was left of their crops after the drought only 
after they are finished will they know the full extent of their 
losses prerequisite for receiving benefits under the program 
its a productionloss program said dale hertlein 
executive director of the fayette county ohio ascs office so 
to know exactly what the guy has lost he will have to finish 
harvesting first 
in texas ascs state executive director terence g harman said 
quiet prevailed at most of the agencys 239 county offices 
were in harvest in a lot of the crops down here and so 
were involved in a lot of other things rather than standing in 
line he said i think there will be a gradual trickle of 
farmers coming in to apply for the benefits in the months ahead 
im sure there must be somebody in the state of iowa who is 
done with the harvest said bob furleigh state ascs director 
but he said there was no flood of farmers at the agencys offices 
ascs has county offices nationwide and in some cases farmers who 
have wrapped up the harvest can do much of the paperwork of 
applying for benefits on computer terminals in those offices 
sometimes farmers can obtain a check on the day that they apply 
for the aid in other cases the length of the wait varies 
the cost of the assistance remains uncertain although officials 
say it could exceed the 39 billion price tag estimated when the 
measure won congressional approval 
among highlights for eligible producers 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
livestock producers with annual gross revenues of less than 25 
million can get either half of their feed costs from the government 
or surplus grain owned by the departments commodity credit corp 
at discounted prices 
those eligible are producers of cattle sheep goats swine 
poultry horses mules and donkeys used for food or in the 
production of food and fish used for commercial food production 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
crop producers with gross annual revenues of less than 2 
million can receive payments for losses greater than 35 percent of 
normal production 
they are eligible for aid equal to 90 percent of losses in 
excess of 75 percent of normal production 
producers also are eligible for assistance equal to 65 percent 
of losses between 35 percent of normal production and 75 percent 
these losses are calculated on the basis of payment rates 
set by the agriculture department and which vary from one crop to 
another 
on that basis some of the payment rates will involve 
for crops participating in farm programs such as wheat feed 
grains cotton and rice the payment rate will be the target price 
a figure set by congress adjusted by the secretary of agriculture 
and normally used to calculated deficiency or income support 
payments for farmers 
for nonparticipating program crops the payment rate will be 
the county rate for pricesupport loans 
for tobacco the payment rate will be the national average 
pricesupport loan rate for the type of tobacco involved 
for sugar beets and sugar cane the payment rate will be a 
level determined by the secretary to be fair and reasonable in 
relation to 1988crop price supports for beets and cane 
for soybeans and nonprogram crops the payment rate will be 
the average commodity price received in the state for the previous 
five years not counting the high and low years 
among other provisions farmers who received advance deficiency 
or incomesupport payments may not have to refund those 
otherwise unearned payments on crop losses up to 35 percent of 
normal production 
an owner of 1000 or fewer acres of trees planted for commercial 
purposes will be eligible for 65 percent federal assistance if 
losses of the 1987 or 1988 tree seedlings is greater than 35 
percent adjusted for normal mortality

the supreme court studying whether states may 
use antiracketeering laws to close down adult bookstores was told 
monday by an indiana prosecutor that a key part of that states law 
may be invalid 
stephen goldsmith of indianapolis prosecuting attorney for 
marion county conceded under questioning from the justices during 
the opening day of the new court term that some pretrial seizures 
of material may be unconstitutional 
but goldsmith said the questionable nature of pretrial seizures 
should not be a basis to throw out racketeering laws that are 
providing a growing number of states with a powerful new weapon to 
fight obscenity and organized crime 
invalidating such laws would provide a safe haven for 
organized crime goldsmith said 
john h weston a beverly hills calif lawyer representing 
indiana bookstore owners said the racketeering laws pose a major 
threat to free speech 
a basic governing concept that has ennobled the countrys 
history is that anyone may not lose the right of speaking by 
speaking he said 
weston said laws like the one in indiana not only threaten book 
sellers but also abridge the american publics right to receive 
vast quantities of material 
indianas racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations law 
patterned after the muchused federal rico act authorizes law 
enforcement officials to seize property used in a racketeering 
enterprise 
the law was used in march 1984 against three fort wayne 
bookstores selling sexually explicit materials each was accused of 
at two least violations of the states obscenity laws 
authorities padlocked the stores and seized all inventory 
similar legal action was taken against three stores in indianapolis 
although those store owners did not appeal to the supreme court 
the three fort wayne bookstores were allowed to reopen in april 
1985 but only one fort wayne books remains in business it filed 
one of the appeals that the supreme court agreed to study and 
decide by july 
the justices also are reviewing a companion case in which the 
howard county ind sheriffs office charged ronald sappenfield 
with distributing obscene material and violating the state rico 
law the case has not yet gone to trial 
an indiana appeals court ruled in june 1985 that applying the 
state rico law to those whose only offenses are alleged obscenity 
violates free speech rights 
padlocking bookstores accused but not convicted of selling 
obscene material is impermissible prior restraint on free 
expression the appeals court said 
but the indiana supreme court in march 1987 reinstated the law 
during an hours arguments before the us supreme court on 
monday goldsmith was pressed to explain why law enforcement 
officials could seize a stores entire inventory of books based on 
as little as two sales of an osbcene book 
justice john paul stevens said the law seems to brand the 
bookstore as a criminal enterprise that authorizes an 
inventorywide seizure even if the rest of the store is filled 
with nothing but charles dickens and william shakespeare 
goldsmith said the law is designed to apply with equal force to 
for example drug dealers and smut peddlers it would be no 
different than if cocaine were sold twice he said the purpose 
is to prevent organized crime from shielding the proceeds of 
illegal activities he said 
while goldsmith conceded that pretrial seizures of bookstore 
inventory may be unconstitutional he argued that in the case of 
fort wayne books the law enforcement activities were permissible 
he said the store was convicted 39 times previously of obscenity 
violations 
goldsmith also said that postconviction seizures of bookstores 
should be permitted even if the high court invalidates pretrial 
seizures 
the justices also quizzed weston vigorously 
chief justice william h rehnquist questioned why someone 
convicted of obscenity violations should be protected from having 
property seized any more than a drug dealer should enjoy that 
safeguard 
peddling obscenity is not presumptively protected by the first 
amendment he said

two navy airman and a former civilian coworker 
allege that untested parts from a wrecked huey helicopter are being 
used to keep a pair of rescue helicopters in operation at the 
navys corpus christi base 
petty officer bryan sims of houston and a former petty officer 
who did not want to be identified told the houston chronicle they 
have been punished for objecting to the practice of installing 
unproven parts from a huey that crashed in 1985 killing three 
crewmen 
their former coworker a mechanic also asked not to be 
identified the chronicle said 
the former petty officer received an honorable discharge this 
year sims 27 faces a courtmartial both maintain that 
accusations against them ranging from alcohol abuse to losing 
gear are false 
sims a helicopter mechanic still assigned to the corpus christi 
naval air station says gauges hydraulic equipment and flight 
control rods were switched from the wrecked helicopter to the pair 
still in service 
a base spokesman said the hueys have been tested and are safe 
but he would not immediately discuss how spare parts are obtained 
lt barbara kent a spokeswoman at navy headquarters in 
washington said the navy does not routinely use parts from wrecked 
equipment 
she said any part that is recovered from a damaged aircraft 
must be properly tested and certified ready for issue 
any naval aircraft which has had maintenance performed on a 
part of the flight control system engine or any other 
safetyofflight related component or system is flight tested 
before final clearance for normal operations kent added 
the three who talked to the chronicle said orders to transfer 
the parts were issued by chief petty officers and the parts were 
not examined or tested before being installed 
the mechanic told the newspaper that the helicopters could crash 
if the control rods malfunction 
sims and the other men acknowledged they have no proof that the 
recycled parts have malfunctioned during flight 
the hueys are used primarily to rescue airmen from trouble 
during training flights from bases in corpus christi beeville and 
kingsville they also back up the coast guard during any rescues of 
civilians in the gulf of mexico 
base spokesman lt robert stevens said the hueys are being 
inspected by an army maintenance team and are safe the 
inspections he said are not in response to objections from any 
airmen 
base commander capt cl reynolds said the navy is not 
attempting to harass or discriminate against sims 
personnel records supplied by sims contain several positive 
assessments but sims said he started receiving negative ratings 
in 1986 after he refused an order to transfer a control arm from 
the wrecked helicopter which was stored outdoors to a working one 
one 1988 evaluation says sims should not remain in the service 
because he is selfserving and selfseeking and has a sullen 
arrogant and condescending attitude 
none of the criticisms mentions any refusal by sims to transfer 
the helicopter parts

the wife of an air force officer whose 
plane crashed during the vietnam war testified monday that the 
misidentification of some bone fragments as his was like giving him 
a death sentence should he still be alive in southeast asia 
the message went out to those countries dont you ever 
return that guy because this would be a real humiliation to the 
us government anne hart told a federal judge hearing a 
multimilliondollar lawsuit brought by mrs hart her daugher 
gillian and her motherinlaw vera hart 
the 45yearold pensacola woman was was the first witness in the 
nonjury civil trial over the militarys misidentification of 
seven bone fragments found at a plane crash site in laos as being 
the remains of lt col thomas hart iii 
the military withdrew the identification after an outside expert 
hired by mrs hart said it was impossible to tell if the fragments 
belonged to her husband or anyone else 
the lawsuit claims the three suffered emotional distress as a 
result of the misidentification which they contend was 
intentional and they are seeking an unspecified amount put only in 
the multimilliondollar range five other children originally 
listed as plaintiffs have been dropped from the suit 
senior us district judge winston arnow ruled jan 12 that mrs 
hart suffered from severe emotional distress leaving only the 
matter of damages to be decided in her portion of the case 
lawyers for the plaintiffs will try to show harts mother also 
was emotionally distressed and that his daughter suffered from 
bulemia an eating disorder that caused her to lose 30 pounds 
its very similar to living without any skin anne hart said 
of her life since the dispute over the bones identification began 
in 1985 
she described the initial news of her husbands plane crash dec 
21 1972 and then the identification of the remains more than 13 
years later as like being hit with a twobyfour 
she said she recovered enough to lead a relatively normal life 
after the crash but she has been unable to do so following the 
misidentification of the remains and the militarys insistance on 
burying them as her husband 
a selfproclaimed army brat whose father was a military 
physician she accused army and air force officials of lying to her 
and causing her to become so disillusioned with the government she 
once revered that she had to seek professional counseling for 
emotional distress 
she said she has has trouble sleeping and gave up activities 
with the national league of families a support group for families 
of servicemen who are missing in action or had been prisoners she 
testified she spends most of her waking hours as a volunteer worker 
at the pensacola veterans center where she can be with people who 
feel the same way 
she also testified she has left her children to fend for 
themselves failed to pay bills although she had the money to do so 
and can see no reason for living although she lacks the courage to 
commit suicide 
hart was one of 16 crew members aboard the ac130 spectre 
gunship when it was shot down near pakse laos 
two crewmen were rescued and one was immediately identified as 
killed but the other 13 has been listed as missing until the crash 
site was excavated by us army and laotian authorities in 1985

some residents whose homes were rattled by 
sonic booms from discovery on monday said they were delighted by 
the thundering reminders that america is back in space 
they dont bother me one bit said wayne roper of ojai a 
resort community 60 miles northwest of los angeles its just 
good to have them back i love the space shuttle 
ojai residents have long lived under the flight path of space 
shuttles and are used to the sonic booms that in the past have 
broken windows and knocked glassware off shelves in the largely 
rural mountainous area 
but no problems were reported with the discoverys booms which 
most treated like the return of an old friend after the skies went 
silent following the challenger tragedy 32 months ago 
it startled for me for a second and then i said to myself 
theres the discovery said john christianson then i didnt 
have to wonder anymore whether everything would be all right i 
knew the shuttle was here 
the discovery glided at supersonic speeds over ojai at about 
930 am pdt before safely landing seven minutes later on a dry 
lake bed in the mojave desert to the cheers of more than 400000 
spectators 
the sonic booms caused by shock waves produced by discovery as 
it traveled faster than the speed of sound were heard from as far 
north as santa barbara and south to suburban valencia about 35 
miles northwest of downtown los angeles 
police dispatchers in santa barbara and ojai said they got one 
call each from people asking about the noise but no damage was 
reported 
valencia resident linda ruhland described the sound as a 
baboom 
i thought it was sort of sexy she said

analyses used by federal agencies to check on 
pesticides in the nations food supply cant detect about half the 
pesticides permitted to be used a research arm of congress 
reported monday 
food is checked by the food safety inspection service of the 
agriculture department which analyzes meat and poultry the 
departments agricultural marketing service which analyzes eggs 
and the food and drug administration part of the health and human 
services department which analyzes all other foods 
as a routine matter the agencies can use only multiresidue 
analyses methods that reveal the concentration of a number of 
compounds except in special cases methods useful for detecting 
only one compound are too expensive to use the congressional 
office of technology assessment reported 
there are 316 pesticide active ingredients for which the 
environmental protection agency has established maximum permissible 
concentration of residues in food or tolerances 
the ota report said the five multiresidue methods used by the 
food and drug administration can detect only 163 compounds 
similarly these methods can detect only 10 of 74 compounds with 
pending or temporary tolerances 25 of 56 with no established 
tolerance and 92 of 297 breakdown products impurities or other 
pesticideassociated chemicals 
the report presented less detail on the food safety inspection 
service but did say the four methods used there can detect about 
40 chemicals 
fsis has identified 10 highly ranked pesticides it would like 
to monitor routinely but cannot using its multiresidue methods 
the report said 
fda spokesman emil corwin said the agency had not had a chance 
to study the report and therefore could not comment a chemist to 
whom he referred detailed questions did not answer 
usda spokeswoman karen stuck said she was seeking comment from 
agency officials 
diane baxter staff scientist for the national coalition against 
the misuse of pesticides said the lack of coverage in routine 
monitoring worries us very much 
she said fungicides of a class called ebdc whose breakdown 
products cause cancer and the herbicide glyphosate are chemicals 
that need routine monitoring 
results from what analyses could be performed showed a low 
failure rate the report said 25 percent of about 12700 samples 
last year showed excessive residues but the sampling was not 
random 
samples contained a higher percentage of fruits and vegetables 
than the general food supply and were biased toward foodpesticide 
combinations known to yield residue problems

the supreme court announced monday it will 
settle a dispute over pension benefits in which billions of dollars 
could be at stake 
the court said it will hear an appeal by the mead corp of 
dayton ohio which was ordered to pay additional pension benefits 
to six workers at a virginia company formerly owned by mead 
mead acquired lynchburg foundry co in virginia in 1968 and set 
up a pension plan that provided earlyretirement benefits to 
workers at age 62 and had 30 years of service 
mead sold lynchburg foundry to a new owner in 1983 and 
terminated the pension plan 
it refused to pay the early retirement benefits to the six 
workers five of them had worked more than 30 years apiece although 
none had reached 62 the sixth had worked 28 years and was 61 
the six were given lumpsum benefits by mead that were based on 
a retirement age of 65 a total of about 56500 less for all six 
than they would have received under the earlyretirement plan 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals ruled in april 1987 that 
mead must pay additional benefits to the former employees from a 
10 million surplus in the companys pension fund 
the appeals court said five of the six workers must receive 
benefits based on what they would be entitled to if they retired at 
62 and the benefits for the sixth should be calculated on a 
retirement age of 63 that he would reach with 30 years service 
the appeals court based its ruling on the employee retirement 
income security act of 1974 a federal law designed to protect 
workers pensions 
mead said billions of dollars could be at stake in the case for 
pension plans nationwide 
more than 49 million workers are covered by 849000 retirement 
plans that control almost 2 trillion in assets the company said 
and the issues involved in the case acted on monday affect more 
than a quarter of those plans 
the case is mead corp vs tilley 871868

the soviet union says it is ready to set 
aside troops for a reserve of un peacekeepers to be sent to 
global flashpoints if other nations do the same 
it also suggests posting un peacekeepers in explosive areas 
of the world 
carolyn dulin a spokeswoman for the us mission said of 
moscows latest proposals these are interesting ideas i would 
not say they are good or bad 
she said however that the suggestions are the latest in an 
overall soviet package of proposals for international security 
which washington opposes on the grounds it would replace the 
existing un charter 
last thursday the un peacekeeping operations were awarded the 
nobel peace prize for 1988 
the latest soviet proposal first introduced as a document to 
the general assembly on sept 22 and now bound for assembly 
consideration calls for the establishment of a reserve of 
military observers and armed forces of the united nations 
the ussr is prepared to participate in the formation on a 
mutual basis with other countries of a system of personnel training 
for service in the united nations troops it added 
the soviets said they would be willing to provide their own 
military units in appropriate peacekeeping situations 
the five permanent members of the security council the united 
states britain france china and the soviet union usually do 
not send troops to join peacekeeping units to avoid accusations 
that the superpowers or former colonial powers are trying to 
involve their armed forces in local conflicts 
there have been exceptions such as the british peacekeepers in 
cyprus and americans in lebanon when the countries requesting 
peacekeepers do not object 
the soviet proposal also suggested an expanded use of un 
peacekeepers in situations where accusations are made of outside 
interference for the purpose of destabilizing governments and 
putting un observers along the borders of a nation fearing 
foreign interference at the request of that country alone 
last week the soviets assailed the un peacekeepers in 
pakistan and afghanistan for allegedly not investigating soviet and 
afghan claims that pakistan was repeatedly violating the april 14 
geneva accord on afghanistan the soviets and afghans accused 
pakistan of trying to undermine afghanistan 
the accord calls for soviet withdrawal from afghanistan and for 
noninterference in the internal affairs of afghanistan and 
pakistan 
the soviet foreign ministry spokesman gennady gerasimov said 
last week the fate of future peacekeeping forces is in question 
because of this issue 
the soviets could use their seat on the security council to 
block establishment of peacekeeping units 
the newest soviet un peacekeeping proposals are part of the 
comprehensive system of international peace and security that 
moscow has introduced for three general assembly sessions so far 
without success 
its no secret that were against the comprehensive 
system said us spokeswoman dulin on monday we feel thats 
sort of a reforming of the un charter which we feel is not 
necessary 
other western un ambassadors on the security council have said 
they think some soviet proposals have merit their objection is 
only to the overall package which they say would replace the 
charter

iran said monday the security councils 
meek criticism of the iraqis use of poison gas encouraged iraq 
to continue its horrifying use of chemical weapons against 
the kurdish minority 
the allegation was made by iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velyati in his address to the 43rd session of the general assembly 
iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons against iran in the 
8yearold war between the persian gulf nations but has denied 
using such weapons against its own kurdish rebels battling for 
autonomy in northwestern iraq 
iraq also has accused iran of using chemical weapons in the war 
a charge iran has denied 
the us state department has said it has evidence iraq used 
poison gas against the kuridsh insurgents 
velyati told the general assembly while the security council 
dealt in two different resolutions 612 and 620 with the iraqi use 
of chemical weapons the mild nature of the resolutions in fact 
encouraged iraq to continue on a massive scale its horrifying use 
of chemical weapons 
resolution 612 condemned the use of chemical weapons and 620 
criticized the use of such weapons against iranians without 
mentioning iraq 
western diplomats have said the security council did not 
specifically denounce iraq because it hoped to avoid complicating 
the iraniraq peace talks 
velayati said that after the security council resolutions iraq 
used on a large scale chemical weapons against its own kurds in 
the northern part of the country 
the foreign minister again blamed iraq for starting the war and 
claimed the iraqis had seized more than 700 prisoners of war since 
a unmediated ceasefire began aug 20 
velyati gave no indication of any change in irans positon on 
the disputed shattalarab estuary which is the southern boundary 
between the two nations and is iraqs only waterway outlet to the 
persian gulf 
a boundary treaty was established in 1975 but iraq has 
repudiated it and claims iran abrogated the accord in 1979 iraq 
wants control over both banks of the shattalarab to ensure a 
secure passage to the gulf 
that is a main issue stalling peace negotiations that remained 
deadlocked after a session at the united nations on saturday it 
was the first meeting between iran and iraq since talks in geneva 
on sept 13 
velayati without naming israel also said the conflicts in the 
middle east cannot be resolved until this racist regime is 
eradicated and the rights of palestinians to selfdetermination and 
the establishment of an independent government within their own 
territory are restored

the national association of securities dealers 
announced monday that despite its opposition in principle to 
marketwide trading halts it would go along with one at the 
request of the securities and exchange commission 
although the nasd which governs the overthecounter stock 
market repeated its objections in detail the new position by its 
board of governors is seen as removing an obstacle to sec approval 
of a proposed oneyear experiment with a trading halt rule 
in july the new york stock exchange the nations largest stock 
market and the chicago mercantile exchange the largest market for 
stock index futures submitted a socalled circuit breaker plan 
that would halt trading across markets for one hour if the dow 
jones industrial average fell 250 points or more or if the futures 
market dropped by a parallel amount the plan calls for a twohour 
halt if the dow fell an additional 150 points 
if the nasd had refused to budge it would have made 
implementation of the pilot program difficult because the sec does 
not have authority to impose an acrosstheboard market halt 
without a presidential order 
ever since the stock market crash last oct 19 when the dow 
fell 508 points securities industry and government officials have 
been trying to agree on measures to calm volatility and restore 
investor confidence 
one of the few concrete proposals to emerge has been the circuit 
breaker concept first advanced by the white house task force headed 
by investment banker and now treasury secretary nicholas f brady 
an administration working group that included the heads of the 
regulatory agencies affected including the sec later endorsed it 
sec spokeswoman mary mccue said of the nasd position we 
believe its a constructive action and its generally consistent 
with the recommendations of the working group 
she said the agency has not yet acted on the submission from the 
nyse and merc but said action on such proposals is generally taken 
within 90 days 
those who favor circuit breakers say the stock and futures 
markets in effect behave as one market because highspeed computer 
linkages proponents argue that it is better to artificially stop 
trading at a predetermined point before one market breaks down 
sending sell orders cascading into markets that remain open 
however nasd joseph r hardiman said in a statement that 
circuit breakers are likely to increase market volatility rather 
than curb it 
the closer a market gets to a circuit breaker level the more 
likely it is of reaching as sellers rush to execute orders under 
the wire academic studies also indicate that markets are the most 
volatile at the opening or reopening of a security following a 
trading halt he said 
but the nasd statement said its board acknowledged that there 
may be unacceptable risks imposed on any market which remains open 
when all its counterparts have closed 
were recognizing were living in the real world here and if 
all other markets close we cant just stand here and be the market 
of last liquidity said nasd spokesman bob ferri 
the new nasd stance is effective through the end of 1989

a former ef hutton branch manager has 
dropped a lawsuit claiming he was libeled in the brokerage firms 
1985 report about its elaborate checkkiting scheme according to 
court papers filed monday 
the outofcourt settlement negotiated in july by attorneys for 
john m pearce and hutton was approved in an order by us district 
judge thomas flannery 
according to court papers each side will pay its own expenses 
in the case which was to be submitted first to arbitration by the 
new york stock exchange before any proceedings in federal court 
the settlement was negotiated shortly after pearce had lost his 
suit against former attorney general griffin bell who had been 
hired by hutton to investigate the checkkiting scheme and produce 
a report 
a federal court jury on june 20 absolved bell of any civil 
liability ruling that none of the statements about pearce in the 
report was false or defamatory 
the terms of the settlement were not made public and attorneys 
for both sides refused to comment on it the matter stands 
resolved said stephen g milliken pearces lawyer 
hutton now part of shearson lehman hutton inc pleaded guilty 
in 1985 to 2000 counts of mail and wire fraud and agreed to pay a 
2 million fine after admitting that branch employees participated 
in the overdrafting scheme 
the company also agreed to reimburse banks for the millions of 
dollars in interest that was lost when branch officers wrote checks 
against funds that had not been deposited in their company accounts 
bell and his atlanta law firm king amp spalding were hired to 
conduct an internal investigation and write a report about the 
check kiting scheme the report blamed pearce who managed hutton 
branches in bethesda md and st louis as one of six officials 
responsible for the scheme 
pearce now a businessman in sarasota fla claimed that bell 
and hutton conspired to absolve top company managers by placing the 
blame on midlevel executives 
his parallel claim against hutton was to be submitted to 
arbitration under new york stock exchange rules 
bell whose report exonerated top officials of wrongdoing said 
he couldnt find any evidence of illegal conduct by the companys 
ranking officials the report only blamed these executives for 
failure to properly manage employees and detect improprieties

a moderate opposition figure who founded a 
group to promote private enterprise said he was offered a position 
monday in the government being formed by new prime minister 
mieczyslaw f rakowski 
unconfirmed reports said other members of the opposition also 
were approached about serving in the government 
aleksander paszynski who edits a magazine for private home 
builders and who founded the probusiness economic society said in 
a telephone interview that he was offered a position at a meeting 
with rakowski on monday 
the economic society for a year has been stymied in its bid for 
official registration 
paszynski said rakowskis offer concerned the ministry of 
construction and local planning and the job would deal with 
apartment construction he declined to be more specific and said he 
had not made up his mind whether to accept 
i can say only one thing that he rakowski is really 
intensively searching for new faces said paszynski i cant 
tell you what the results of this search are 
rakowski a member of the ruling communist party politburo was 
appointed prime minister on sept 27 and is scheduled to present 
his cabinet for approval by the sejm or parliament on oct 13 
rakowski told parliament he would need two weeks to enlist 
ministers with reformatory attitudes and expressed the hope his 
would be a coalition government with a broader representation 
than has been the case 
rakowski succeeded zbigniew messner who resigned sept 19 with 
his entire cabinet after the government came under heavy attack for 
its handling of the economy 
bronislaw geremek a senior adviser to solidarity leader lech 
walesa said he heard of several attempts to enlist independent 
figures for high posts in the rakowski government but knew of no 
one who accepted 
geremek called the recruitment a strange attempt certain 
to fail to circumvent planned roundtable talks this month 
between authorities and the opposition 
paszynski has been a leading advocate for the right to form 
private associations the official publication lad quotes him in 
its current issue as urging that solidarity be made legal again and 
that other groups including his own economic society be legalized 
solidarity outlawed in 1982 reported that opposition activist 
jozef pinior and three associates received suspended sentences by a 
wroclaw court on monday for an alleged assault on a factory guard 
there during a wave in strikes in may 
czeslaw borowczyk was sentenced to 1 years in prison pinior 
and aleksandra sarata to one year each and yolanta skiba to eight 
months but all sentences were suspended for a threeyear 
probationary period pinior reported 
they were found guilty in connection with an incident during a 
may 5 factory rally at the dolmel electric machinery plant in which 
the guard was said to have suffered a broken arm 
pinior a solidarity leader in wroclaw and a founder of the 
illegal polish socialist party or pps denied assaulting the 
guard as did the other defendants 
we treat it as pure harassment for our pps activities 
pinior said of the verdict he said the four planned to appeal

the league of women voters dropped its 
sponsorship of the second presidential debate monday in a protest 
over its lack of control and the two campaigns quickly agreed to 
replace it with a bipartisan commission 
spokesmen for both democrat michael dukakis and republican 
george bush said the debate would go on probably on oct 13 or 14 
as scheduled with the substitute sponsor 
the bipartisan commission on presidential debates which 
sponsored the first debate 10 days ago in winstonsalem nc said 
it accepted the campaigns invitation and was taking steps to hold 
the debate in los angeles as planned 
the commission is delighted to respond positively to the 
invitation and regards it as a vote of confidence in the 
commissions approach to the debate said janet brown executive 
director of the commission we hope to be able to make an 
announcment in the next day or so about funding partners 
brown said the group which was formed by the two national 
parties was seeking local partners to help finance the debate 
the group was invited to become the new sponsor after dukakis 
campaign chairman paul brountas and bush chairman james a baker 
iii talked by telephone and agreed to ask the commission 
the debate had been scheduled for oct 13 or 14 depending on 
the baseball playoff schedule 
the leagues move does not affect the debate between vice 
presidential nominees scheduled wednesday evening in omaha neb 
league of women voters president nancy m neuman announced the 
pullout at a washington news conference where she used strong 
language to denounce an agreement worked about between the two 
presidential campaigns for debate format staging and other details 
she charged it would restrict questioning of the candidates and 
result in a charade devoid of spontaneity and a true exchange 
on the issues 
we have no intention of becoming an accessory to the 
hoodwinking of the american public neuman said 
both the bush and dukakis campaigns said the leagues decision 
would not jeopardize the second debate and disputed the leagues 
charge they pointed to the success of the first debate at wake 
forst university held under the same terms 
but it was clear that dukakis the lesser known and underdog 
candidate stood to lose the most if the leagues decision denied 
him the chance to meet bush a second time before a national 
television audience 
i want to go forward in los angeles dukakis said the 
agreement with the bush campaign provides that if for some reason 
the sponsor decides to pull out we still go ahead i want to go 
ahead 
bush spokesman mark goodin said the commission agreed to sponsor 
the debate under the terms rejected by the league 
they have both agreed that there will be no debate after oct 
14 and that they will continue to look at los angeles but if that 
is not doable we will certainly look at other places goodin said 
there is going to be a second presidential debate goodin 
said 
neuman the league president contended the campaigns have so 
controlled the format that questioning by a panel of journalists 
will be subject to very clear restrictions in ters of what they 
can ask 
she said the agreement that was presented to the league last 
wednesday was a closeddoor masterpiece presented as a done 
deal in a printed statement she did not read at her news 
conference she said the agreement would perpetrate a fraud on 
the american voter and add debates to their list of 
campaigntrail charades devoid of substance spontaneity and honest 
answers to tough questions 
the leagues involvement in 1988 debates has been long an issue 
spurred in part by discontent with the leagues sponsorship of 
debates in previous presidential elections the republican and 
democratic parties joined with the bipartisan commission on 
presidential debates to sponsor them this year 
but sponsorship itself became one of the items at issue in 
hardball debate negotiations between the dukakis and bush 
campaigns the campaigns ultimately agreed to two debates one 
sponsored by the commission and one by the league plus a vice 
presidential debate under commission sponsorship 
at her news conference neuman released copies of the detailed 
agreement reached by the two campaigns it appeared to be the 
general agreement that also covered their first debate 
she said the league objected to a number of format and staging 
issues but acknowledged that at the heart of their dispute was the 
leagues lack of involvement in the agreement 
the issue is whos in control of the debate she said 
the leagues decision was made by its 14member board of 
trustees 
pressed by reporters she said conditions for the debate were 
the same as the winstonsalem debate and said that panel was 
able to get around some of the limitations placed on it 
when asked what restrictions the journalists faced she cited 
the requirement that the moderators script be approved by the 
campaigns she also objected to the presence of a telephone line 
from each campaigns headquarters at the debate site to the 
debates television producer and to the pattern for rebuttal and 
follow up questions 
bush campaign officials privately belittled the leagues 
complaints as nitpicking items and denied an attempt to control 
questioning 
one bush campaign source speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the leagues action guarantees theyre out of the debate 
business for good they made the mistake of misunderstanding their 
role 
the debate was scheduled for the shrine memorial auditorium in 
los angeles while neuman suggested a willingness to give up league 
rights to the auditorium vicky harian the leagues debates 
director said i doubt very seriously it would relinquish its 
rights

a georgia congressman dogged by news accounts 
of a grand jury investigation into drug money laundering demanded 
monday on the house floor that he be indicted immediately on all 
charges that may be under consideration 
rep pat swindall rga who is locked in a tight reelection 
battle said he told attorney general dick thornburgh in a letter 
monday that he is ready able and willing to go to trial on the 
day following the indictment which i now request 
simple justice and fairness demand that i be allowed to prove 
my innocence in a court of law rather than in the media swindall 
said simple justice and fairness also demand that i be allowed 
to prove my innocence before rather than after the nov 8 
elections 
justice department spokesman john russell said thornburgh would 
have no response to swindalls request 
on friday swindall criticized the grand jury investigation and 
suggested it might be politically motivated us attorney robert 
barr in atlanta responded that the decision by his office and grand 
juries in his district have never been are not and will never 
be influenced or made on the basis of statements by or pressures 
from third parties including persons who may be subjects of 
investigations 
earlier this year it was disclosed that a videotape had been 
made of an aug 28 1987 meeting swindall had with an undercover 
federal agent posing as a money launderer for underworld figures 
swindall was subpoenaed and testified before the grand jury in 
february but has never been charged with any crime 
in june atlanta newspapers obtained tape recordings from the 
investigation and published excerpts that showed swindall continued 
to pursue negotiations for a 850000 home construction loan long 
after being told it might be financed with drug money he would be 
helping to launder 
swindall apologized for his role in the negotiations saying he 
was wrong and ashamed but would continue to seek reelection he 
also asked the house ethics committee to determine if he had 
violated any law or house rule the panel agreed to investigate 
but has not issued a ruling 
swindall said monday that news that the grand jury had been 
reconvened just 36 days prior to the election made him take the 
unprecedented request for his indictment he is opposed by 
democrat ben jones 
swindall said newspaper stories about the investigation based on 
unnamed federal sources have made it impossible for him to defend 
himself 
the only way i know to stop it is to throw myself at the mercy 
at the court and say i waive my rights i want an immediate 
trial he said i will try the case myself i will walk into 
the courtroom with a simple yellow pad and i will prove my 
innocence in a forum where i can prove it

orders to us factories for manufactured 
goods surged 31 percent in august the government said monday in a 
report cited as more evidence the economy continues to grow at a 
robust pace 
the commerce department said orders rose 68 billion to a 
seasonally adjusted 2266 billion rebounding from a 36 percent 
decline in july the worst in 18 months orders were up 54 percent 
in june the biggest jump in 17 years 
the overall orders number has been influenced in recent months 
by wide swings in orders for transportation equipment particularly 
aircraft 
but analysts said the underlying trend is strong and indicates 
that a jump in the unemployment rate from 54 percent in july to 
56 percent in august may be an aberration 
there has been some question in the financial markets as to 
whether manufacturing is stalling out but with the orders 
situation as strong as it is its clear to us manufacturing 
remains on a solid track said stephen s roach an economist 
with morgan stanley amp co i think the economy as a whole is 
continuing to display very good momentum 
total orders for the first eight months of the year have 
averaged 2177 billion a month 78 percent higher than a year ago 
jerry jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers said members of his trade group remain optimistic 
at least through the rest of 1988 
manufacturers in general dont see any slowdown in their 
orders over the next three to four months he said 
in another report the commerce department said construction 
spending in august fell 06 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 3961 billion economists say rising interest rates and 
high vacancy rates for many kinds of buildings have kept this 
sector sluggish 
manufacturing has been one of the most vigorous areas of the 
economy this year because export sales have boomed with the lower 
value of the dollar which makes us goods more affordable on 
overseas markets 
to meet demand for exports manufacturers have stepped up 
spending on new machinery to modernize their factories roach said 
manufacturers prior to this year had been expanding capacity at the 
slowest rate since world war ii and now that theyre finally 
spending more theyre unlikely to taper off before considerable 
pent up demand is met 
orders for nondefense capital goods rose 63 percent in august 
to 385 billion after rising 21 percent in july and 125 percent 
in june 
thats an extraordinary rise roach said 
orders for durable goods big ticket items expected to last 
three or more years jumped 59 percent following a 74 percent 
fall in july and an 87 percent increase in june 
excluding the volatile defense goods category orders rose 27 
percent in august following a 06 percent decline a month earlier 
and a 29 percent rise in june 
orders for transportation equipment a subcategory of durable 
goods were up 190 percent following a drop of 225 percent in 
july and a 333 percent jump in june 
the department said the august gain in transportation to 348 
billion which included a 1671 percent rise in orders for military 
ships and tanks was led by a 144 percent gain in aircraft and a 
170 percent jump in motor vehicles and parts 
in other categories orders for primary metals including steel 
fell 18 percent and electrical machinery was off a scant 01 
percent after a big increase in july other machinery orders rose 
63 percent 
orders for nondurable goods were off a slight 01 percent to 
1036 billion increases in rubber and plastics paper and tobacco 
offset declines in chemicals petroleum textiles and clothing 
shipments of manufactured goods rose 21 percent in august 
following a 10 percent decline in july

ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said monday 
that irans war reconstruction must be done without criminal 
soviets and worlddevouring america apparently rebuffing rumors 
of a more open foreign policy 
khomeini said the countrys postwar reconstruction policy should 
follow the principle of his revolutionary islamic government 
neither east nor west 
his statement reported by irans official news media and 
monitored in nicosia came in reply to a letter from irans top 
political leaders asking for guidelines for reconstruction policy 
after the 8yearold war with iraq 
the islamic republic news agency quoted khomeini as telling 
president ali khamenei parliament speaker hashemi rafsanjani 
chief justice musavi ardebili and prime minister hussein musavi 
the valiant people of iran will keep their revolutionary and 
sacred faith and hate in their heart and employ their flames 
against criminal soviets and worlddevouring america and their 
agents and will hoist the banner of the genuine islam of prophet 
mohammed throughout the world 
khomeini irans 88yearold revolutionary patriarch and 
spiritual leader told the leaders he knew they would resist 
attraction to east or west adding 
i am keeping a watchful eye on the internal and external 
policies of the country and as long as i am alive i will not let 
the course of our real policy change 
it is your religious duty to cut off the last vein and roots 
of our countrys dependence on foreigners in any field 
khomeini said invisible hands in the east and west had 
spread stories that certain iranian leaders were backing down from 
this position and making connections with east or west he said the 
purpose was to sow discord in the iranian revolution 
in what appeared to be an appeal to avoid public disagreement 
over policy khomeini told my enthusiastic revolutionary 
children not to raise questions with officials without 
considering irans political difficulties he said such questions 
might compel officials to reveal secrets of the islamic state 
evidence has emerged that some iranian leaders notably 
rafsanjani believe iran must open up to the world after years of 
hostile relations with east west and most of irans arab neighbors 
but even rafsanjani has been careful to adhere publicly to the 
ideals of the revolution and declare they must not be diluted by 
more contact with the west 
khomeinis statement seems to come down at least where the 
economy is concerned on the side of the hardliners led by musavi 
who insist on tight state control of the economy and extreme 
suspicion toward foreign involvement 
but it also underlined the political uncertainty that has 
gripped iran since its sudden acceptance of a united 
nationssponsored ceasefire that took effect aug20

a soviet satellite burned up when entering the 
earths atmosphere after its nuclear reactor had been fired farther 
into space the official tass news agency reported monday 
it said the unmanned cosmos1900 spacecraft ceased to exist 
at 126 am sunday moscow time as it hit dense layers of the 
atmosphere over the indian ocean 
the satellite which the soviets said was launched for 
oceanographic research separated from its nuclear reactor on 
saturday to prevent any radiation contamination on earth according 
to tass 
it said the reactor was shut down automatically and boosted into 
a stable orbit at about 440 miles above earth and would remain in 
that orbit long enough for its elements to decay to a safe level of 
radioactivity 
cosmos1900 was launched dec 12 1987 and soviet ground 
controllers lost contact with it in april it was known the 
satellite was doomed because of its declining orbit and there was 
concern it might contaminate the atmosphere with radioactive waste 
on reentry 
the soviets have put 33 nuclearpowered satellites into space 
and one reentered earths atmosphere in 1978 scattering some 
radioactive debris in a remote section of northwestern canada

the senate banking committee chairman william 
proxmire dwis on monday proposed a parliamentary maneuver that 
would if successful allow congress to pass legislation permitting 
bank holding companies to own securities firms 
the senate in march overwhelmingly passed a bill allowing 
affiliates of bank holding companies to underwrite most kinds of 
securities except corporate stock 
in the house the banking committee and the energy and commerce 
committee have passed competing versions both impose more 
restrictions on banks and offer fewer new powers but the energy 
and commerce version is the most restrictive 
the dispute between the committees has turned into a 
jurisdictional war between energy and commerce chairman john 
dingell dmich and banking chairman fernand j st germain dri 
so far house speaker jim wright dtexas has insisted that the 
two settle their differences before the banking bill comes to the 
house floor 
in a letter last week to wright st germain said he and dingell 
had been unable to agree and he complained that the dingell 
committees overly broad perception of its jurisdiction has 
paralyzed one of the most important banking acts of this 
century 
with congress planning to adjourn at the end of the week 
proxmire is proposing that most of the senate bill be attached to 
an unrelated banking bill already passed by the house other parts 
of the senate bill could be passed separately or linked to an 
unrelated securities bill sponsored by dingell that toughens 
penalties for insider trading 
under the proxmire plan the bankingsecurities legislation then 
could be ironed out in a conference between leaders in both 
chambers before coming up for a vote in the full house and senate 
that way the house rules committee would not have to make a 
decision on the competing jurisdictional claims of dingell and st 
germain 
also in a move to meet the concerns of st germain and of sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio who has threatened to block the 
maneuver proxmire added a series of proconsumer provisions to 
the bill including a requirement that banks cash government checks 
for noncustomers and offer lifeline banking accounts to poor 
people

the previous owners of the mcclures 
new house used to take their work home with them unfortunately 
they were coroners 
when the mcclures cat puffy started growling in the backyard 
sunday night their first night in the new home the couple went 
to investigate and found 25 boxes bags and buckets full of human 
body parts 
the labeled body parts were left behind by the former 
homeowners a pair of riverside deputy coroners who apparently 
were doing some work for an independent laboratory authorities 
said 
the bags and boxes were labeled with peoples names a series of 
numbers and dates and a description such as stomach and 
contents 
mcclure said he picked up a plastic bag noted the squishy feel 
and carried it into the light for a better look the label on the 
bag said heart 
it was all purple when i found out it was a heart i dropped

the brick patio under the olive tree and still have our tools in 
the shed the note stated call us if there are any problems

the head of nato said monday that the 
leadership upheaval and other sweeping changes under way in the 
soviet union offer the west a mixed picture but there is still 
more continuity than change 
the aim of soviet reform efforts is of course not to please 
the west nor do the soviets intend to abandon their own system 
secretarygeneral manfred woerner told the royal institute of 
international relations in brussels 
on the contrary the basic objective is to make the present 
system work more efficiently and thus to enhance the credibility 
and authority of the communist party 
woerner former west german defense minister said the west 
should welcome soviet reform programs that promise greater freedom 
for citizens 
it is not in our interest to see the present reform programs 
fail he said stable and improved relations will require 
predictability in the behavior of all countries involved 
woerner said in prepared remarks that soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev faces considerable problems in his efforts to modernize 
the soviet society but he pursues his objective with energy and 
determination as last weeks events in moscow demonstrate 
gorbachev late last week led the most dramatic political changes 
in soviet leadership of his 3 years in power including his 
election as the countrys president to replace andrei gromyko 
in addition gorbachev has pushed policies of glasnost or 
openness and perestroika or reform he also has pressed for 
improved relations with the united states and other members of the 
16nation north atlantic treaty organization defense alliance 
president reagan and gorbachev last december signed the 
intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty that provides for 
elimination over three years of mediumrange nuclear weapons 
east and west negotiators also are pursuing discussions on 
reducing conventional arms in europe 
there can be no doubt that there has been a shift in soviet 
attitudes and positions woerner said nevertheless the 
present picture is a mixed one 
there is still more continuity than change the soviets are 
more actively pursuing arms control but at the same time the 
modernization of nuclear as well as conventional forces facing 
europe continues unabated 
there is a strong push for economic reform he said but 
military expenditures remain at a level far beyond defensive 
requirements 
he defended nato against criticism it has been slow to respond 
to gorbachevs push and lacks a comprehensive strategy for pursuing 
eastwest relations 
i strongly disagree with this perception the achievements of 
the last few years have come in response to our proposals and 
determination he said 
woerner said the west should encourage east bloc leaders in 
their policy changes and be ready for greater cooperation 
but in the end he said future developments will depend 
on these leaders themselves and in particular on the soviets 
they must demonstrate he said that they are not merely 
seeking a breathing space but a permanently improved relationship 
between east and west at a lower and more balanced level of 
forces 
he cautioned that despite reform programs soviet military 
capabilities and posture remain the same we cannot base our 
security on declared intentions which may rapidly change 
a prudent insurance policy requires a defense based on a sober 
evaluation of warsaw pact capabilities and if we are to further 
reduce the level of arms on both sides we must have the political 
determination required to keep the remaining forces nuclear as 
well as conventional strong and uptodate

cooperation but leaders of southern africa still have to take the

between his country and its neighbors and said a strong basis 
for cooperation already exists between south africa and the other

saudi arabia joined the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty on monday in a move that the state 
department praised as a demonstration of that countrys peaceful 
intentions in the middle east 
saudi foreign minister prince saud alfaisal presented the 
documents certifying saudi adherence to the treaty at a ceremony 
attended by secretary of state george p shultz and united nations 
officials 
the united states is one of the countries authorized under the 
treaty to receive such documents 
us officials said saudi officials told shultz earlier this 
year of their intention to subscribe to the treaty under which 
signatory nations promise not to acquire a nuclear weapons 
capability among other requirements 
the reagan administration had been somewhat concerned about 
saudi arabias intentions after the monarchy acquired css2 missiles 
from china the chinese had never exported the weapon previously 
and had equipped its own arsenal with nuclear warheads according 
to us officials who asked not to be identified 
however saudi officials have assured the united states that the 
missiles they imported from china are not equipped with nuclear 
warheads 
israel has long been concerned about saudi arabias intentions 
because of the proximity of the two countries israel has not 
signed the treaty 
the united states is extremely pleased that saudi arabia has 
joined the community of nations embraced by the treaty state 
department spokesman charles redman said 
he called the accord the most widely supported arms control 
treaty in history 
the broad consensus among mankind that the spread of nuclear 
weapons is a danger that can and must be avoided redman said 
with its accession to the treaty today saudi arabia is 
strengthening the global nonproliferation regime demonstrating 
its peaceful intentions in the region 
redman expressed hope that all states which have not yet joined 
the treaty will decide to do so 
shultz spent the day conferring with highranking arab 
diplomats including iraqi foreign minister tariq aziz 
redman said both countries agreed on the importance of expanding 
relations after an extended period of acrimony generated by us 
allgeations that iraq used chemical weapons against kurdish rebels 
he said aziz repeated his sept 17 statement in which he 
promised to abide by commitments iraq has undertaken concerning 
chemical weapons the reagan administration has said it interprets 
that statement to mean iraq forswears the use of such weaponry 
speaking briefly with reporters after meeting shultz aziz said 
there were no complaints from the us side about chemical 
weapons use 
iraq denied engaging in chemical warfare against the kurds but 
the reagan administration said it had evidence to the contrary 
iraq has acknowledged using chemical weapons against iran in 
their 8yearold war

rumors that a woman was taking pictures of 
prospective devilworship victims got so out of hand that an 
artistinresidence said she fled for fear of her own safety 
ive never seen such hysteria over nothing said janice 
braverman a cincinnati photographer she suggested she became the 
rumors target because she was a stranger in town and frantic 
parents and a school principal failed to determine the truth 
when i was fleeing town with my wet negatives my mind went 
back to the salem witch trials and i just couldnt believe that 
that kind of hysteria could happen today and i could understand 
how it could happen then ms braverman said in a telephone 
interview with the associated press late monday 
im not a threateninglooking person im 5 feet tall said 
ms braverman 36 i wasnt wearing black i dont have jaggy 
eyebrows or long fingernails 
ms braverman arrived in irvine in eastern kentucky in 
midseptember to start a oneyear photography project under a 
10000 grant from the kentucky arts council 
rumors that devil worshipers were searching for blond blueeyed 
victims for sacrifices reached the town from surrounding counties 
about the same time 
ms braverman says that when she visited estill county high 
school to discuss the photo program with principal russell bowen 
she ran into four girls in a restroom skipping class 
she told them about the project and they seemed interested 
these were the kinds of kids i wanted to reach ms 
braverman said in an interview with the kentucky post a covington 
newspaper the ones who might not do well in school and get 
discouraged they drop out or skip classes 
she photographed them mugging for the camera in front of the 
mirrors and showed them how to take pictures 
by the weekend rumors were circulating that a woman was taking 
pictures of blondehaired blueeyed girls potential victims for 
devil worshipers 
ms braverman went to bowens office the following monday sept 
12 with estill county arts project director betty holbrook who 
helped arrange the photography project 
bowen came out of his office yelling and screaming mrs 
holbrook said 
janice tried to ask him what was the problem could he tell 
her what was wrong he absolutely refused to talk to her mrs 
holbrook said he threatened to have us arrested and thrown off 
the school grounds 
mrs holbrook said the principal chased them from the building 
shaking his fist and screaming get out get out 
superintendent william alexander later told them that two 
parents talked to bowen about the pictures taken in the restroom 
and that bowen somehow linked ms braverman to the rumors mrs 
holbrook said 
asked by the newspaper if he discussed the matter with ms 
braverman bowen said did i talk with her i dont have to talk 
with anyone to you or anyone else he then hung up 
he could have calmed things down ms braverman said 
instead he fanned the fears 
i thought i could give those students something get them 
excited about something she said now im waking up from 
nightmares i dont know if i ever want to teach again you can 
turn around and find yourself accused of something for no reason at 
all 
alexander declined comment monday as far as im concerned 
the issue here is closed and thats where id prefer to leave 
it he said 
alexander said no action would be taken against any school 
officials 
the widespread rumors apparently began after authorities in 
breathitt county arrested six people in late july stemming from a 
grave robbery that jackson police said appeared to be related to 
devil worship 
rumors that satan worshipers would massacre students in caldwell 
county schools sparked what a police official called a mass 
panic sept 16 when about half of the districts 2400 students 
left school 
in west virginia officials in sissonville blamed teenagers 
with overactive imaginations for rumors last week that a satanic 
cult was searching for a blond blueeyed child for human sacrifice

sir alec issigonis designer of the boxlike mini 
car that brought economical motoring to millions of britons has 
died at age 81 the london times reported 
issigonis who also designed the immensely popular and 
longlived morris minor died at his home in edgbaston birmingham 
on sunday a death notice in tuesdays editions of the times said 
no cause of death was announced but for years issingonis 
suffered from parkinsons disease he retired in 1971 but continued 
working as a consultant to the rover group until a year ago 
more than 5 million minis planned as a box on wheels have 
been built since they were introduced in 1959 setting a new 
standard for smallcar design 
a 10footlong box it weighed about 1300 pounds and sold for 
less than 1500 
it was just the car for the swinging sixties a favorite with 
aristocrats film stars and the bellbottomed and miniskirted 
young people who could at last afford a car 
despite embellishments and refinements its outward appearance 
has never greatly changed the price has multiplied almost tenfold 
but sales are still buoyant 
said issingonis in 1986 oddly enough i dont think im 
proudest of the mini i think it was the morris minor the first 
allbritish car to pass the 1 million mark 
that doughty little car produced between 1948 and 1971 still 
bowls along highways all over britain cherished and coddled by 
owners who shun any thought of driving anything else 
its snubnosed plainness little changed throughout its 
production years retains an aura of tradition and sober 
reliability the woodpaneled station wagons and sprightly 
convertibles are much sought after in the 1980s 
about 100000 are still on british roads thousands survive in 
india and pakistan and sri lankans drive an estimated 45000 of 
them in various stages of decay 
issigonis was born on nov 18 1906 in smyrna then part of 
turkey and came to britain with his widowed mother following the 
1922 war between turkey and greece 
after studying engineering in london he joined morris motors in 
1936 and built a lightweight hillclimb car to demonstrate the 
potential of allindependent suspension 
his first complete production car was the morris minor 
after working at alvis in the early 1950s issigonis returned to 
what had become bmc to design and produce a small economical car 
the mini 
the result was radical for the time a transverse engine 
powering the front wheels 
in 1967 issigonis was named a fellow of the royal society 
britains most prestigious scientific establishment he was 
knighted in 1969 
issigonis was not married

information and was merely saying he didnt want to cast bad luck 
on the situation 
earlier monday fitzwater disclosed that a thirdparty 
government had told the united states that there might be a hostage 
released 
neither reagan nor fitzwater would speculate on possible motives 
behind such a hostage release although both steadfastly denied 
that the us government had been negotiating to win the liberation 
of the americans 
during a picturetaking session in the oval office with visiting 
jamaican prime minister edward seaga reagan said no release would 
take place on the basis of negotiations of any kind we have done 
nothing of that kind

a videotape released by islamic jihad that steen was suffering from 
high blood pressure was in pitiful health and was expected to 
die at any moment despite being under a doctors care

two state troopers in charge of a police 
academy training program that put 16 cadets in the hospital said 
their farewells monday as they prepared to turn their jobs over to 
new instructors 
also monday the state department of public safety ordered its 
police academies to stop using pushups and other exercise as 
punishment in training cadets the agawam police academy was closed 
sept 21 for an investigation 
one cadet remained in a coma after collapsing on his first day 
at the agawam academy which trains police for cities in western 
massachusetts others suffered dehydration and kidney failure 
doctors said 
troopers charles blake gilmore and john m richardson ended 
official duties at the academy monday on tuesday they will 
transfer the academys physical training program to state police 
lt william j shea and trooper james ryan 
the two men asked to be reassigned friday because of the 
attention the academy has received since members of their class 
began collapsing two weeks ago 
they will not have further contact with the class said jeff 
grossman of the department of public safety 
one cadet timothy shepard 25 remained in a coma monday at a 
pittsburgh hospital where he underwent a liver transplant fifteen 
other cadets were hospitalized when they reported to doctors on 
their own or on the orders of the troopers 
several trainees showed signs of dehydration exhaustion and 
kidney failure doctors said 
a team of 15 doctors professors and police chiefs was preparing 
for an examination of the training practices that may have caused 
the ailments 
one member of the team named by the massachusetts criminal 
justice training council the group of 22 law enforcement officials 
that runs the agawam academy said monday she doubted that anything 
but overexercise could have caused the illnesses 
there are data on military recruits who suffered acute renal 
failure from overexertion said priscilla clarkson a university 
of massachusetts researcher on muscle damage 
in fairness to the instructors ms clarkson said they 
may not have known how strenuous the exercise was its a matter of 
knowing what kind of damage the type of exercise youre doing can 
cause some are particularly effective at inducing muscle damage 
without giving an immediate sign 
some cadets reported undergoing 10 hours of exercise the first 
day of class with relatively little water police chiefs who sent 
trainees to the academy have said water was available but the 
cadets may have hesitated to break ranks to ask for it 
another investigation by the state attorney generals office 
entered its second week monday spokeswoman mary breslauer said 
nine investigators were still talking to witnesses

the foreign minister of the philippines 
called monday for creditor nations to reschedule or even forgive 
the debts owed by third world countries 
raul s manglapus also called the united states a hegemonic 
power that he said could ease the debt crisis but had not done so 
manglapus devoted his entire speech to the general assembly to 
the economic policies of the industrialized countries and accused 
them of perpetuating and increasing the debt of third world nations 
it is valuable to reschedule debt but it is even more 
precious and human to forgive debt he said 
manglapus proposed the creation of an international debt and 
development commission to evaluate alternative plans for global 
debt management and said the commission staff could be drawn from 
other international financial agencies 
he said the commission should develop standards for debt relief 
or debt forgiveness and propose them to the united nations for 
approval proclamation and execution 
there is one hegemonic power today that could crack the whip 
the united states of america he said but the crisis is 
enormous and there are rising economic powers with which the 
enforcer must coordinate if order and resolution are to be reached 
this is not happening 
referring to the industrialized north and developing south 
manglapus said the north should not blame imports from the south 
for unemployment and other economic problems and should instead 
stop competing with the south 
he said the north should get out of manufacturing and exporting 
textiles garments and shoes because they are economic activities 
in which the north has no economic advantage 
the debt crisis is not only a problem for the debtor but also 
for the creditor a problem for the world he said 
therefore the solution cannot be sectoral it must be total it 
cannot be regional it must be global 
manglapus praised un achievements in peacekeeping and called 
on the world body to play a larger role in resolving third world 
debt 
what is this debt crisis but a monstrous threat to peace he 
said today the debt of nation to nation is not developing man 
it is killing man

michael dukakis made a rare visit to chicagos 
south side and told black supporters monday that george bush would 
lead an america where the very rich get even richer and the rest 
of us just get by 
the democratic presidential nominee opened a speech at the regal 
theater on chicagos south side with a tribute to the late mayor 
harold washington and dukakis former rival in the presidential 
race jesse jackson 
then repeatedly using the phrase aim high dukakis promised 
an administration that would enforce civil rights laws and provide 
sameday voter registration pick judges committed to equality 
improve the quality of inner city schools and assist 
minorityowned small businesses 
in a few short weeks the american people will choose between 
two fundamentally different futures two different roads to 
travel the massachusetts governor said one road leads to an 
america of privilege an america where the very rich get even 
richer and the rest of us just get by this is george bushs 
america 
the other road leads to an america of hope and opportunity for 
all our citizens dukakis said my friends i want to lead 
america on that high road of hope and opportunity i want to lead 
america into a new decade and a new era of greatness 
aides said it was the first venture by a presidential candidate 
to chicagos south side since jimmy carter in 1976 
dukakis as he did earlier in the day during a rally in 
hartford conn revealed no new proposals and instead touched on 
familiar initiatives on both occassions he used the best 
america theme to end his speech as he ended his closing 
statement at the recent debate with bush 
in between the connecticut and chicago stops dukakis stopped in 
dearborn heights outside detroit to speak to students about drug 
use and help destroy about 100000 worth of marijuana cocaine and 
heroin by tossing it into a county incinerator 
if you think america should settle for the bronze medal then 
you vote for bush and dan quayle a shirtsleeved dukakis told 
the hartford rally 
but if you believe as i do that america and americans should 
go for the gold in the classrooms in the workplace and in the 
world economy then your ticket on nov 8 is mike dukakis and 
lloyd bentsen 
alluding to the discoverys successful space mission dukakis 
said that just as president kennedy made the decision to send 
americans to the moon the next president would have to restore 
us leadership in the world marketplace 
john kennedy raised the stars and stripes until they literally 
reached the moon he said i want to stamp the stars and 
stripes on american products all over the globe 
raising his voice to be heard over chanting bush supporters 
dukakis scoffed at what he called the vice presidents contention 
that everythings fine not to worry 
ask yourself this could your children today buy the house 
they grew up in he asked can they pay for a college education 
without a mountain of debt when they graduate is your family 
really getting ahead or is it just running in place or even 
falling behind 
the massachusetts governor cited his support for universal 
health insurance a college aid program relying on payroll 
deductions job training business investment incentives and 
vigorous enforcement of the trade law 
he also took a swipe at bushs repeated allegations that dukakis 
is a bigspending liberal in hiding 
the solutions were proposing are not bigmoney solutions or 
biggovernment solutions dukakis said and unlike mr bushs 
tired old ideas they wont leave america running in place theyll 
make america the most powerful and productive country on earth 
at the alfred e durr elementary school dukakis occasionally 
spoke in spanish as he urged pupils to careers in teaching or 
science he also took a few questions which he rarely does with 
reporters on the campaign trail 
when dukakis asked the youngsters to name some drugs one 
replied bush is a drug said dukakis puts you to sleep 
right 
at a county incinerator in dearborn heights outside detroit 
dukakis spoke to about 200 students before heading inside to help 
destroy an undetermined quantity of heroin and cocaine 
he then told students he was heading into the incinerator to 
destroy the drugs and said i dont want to burn the hands that 
are going to hold the nation i hope

a man who opted for shooting a drug informant in 
the head and heart instead of injecting him with drain cleaner won 
a stay of execution monday night the second time since the killer 
was sentenced to death in 1976 
bobby marion francis 44 had been scheduled to die at 7 am 
tuesday in the electric chair at florida state prison near starke 
but us district judge lenore nesbitt granted a stay ruling 
inadequate time to consider the appeal 
a monroe county jury found francis guilty of murder in the death 
of titus r walters walters was bound and gagged for nearly two 
hours while francis planned how to kill him according to court 
records francis apparently debated injecting walters with the 
household caustic used to clear clogged pipes 
nesbitt said the appeal was filed shortly after noon monday 
fewer than 19 hours before francis was set to die she said there 
was not enough time for her to study all the testimony in the 
voluminous file 
the stay remains in effect until further orders by the judge 
francis death warrant expires oct 10 
francis who was sentenced to death in june 1976 survived his 
first death warrant when the florida supreme court granted him a 
stay in november 1987 
nine death row inmates are now under active warrants gov bob 
martinez has signed 55 death warrants since taking office 21 months 
ago since then willie jasper darden and beauford white have been

george bush gave a 
thumbsup welcome to the returning crew of the space shuttle 
discovery on monday in a pictureperfect example of how the 
republican can use the vice presidency to advance his campaign for 
the white house 
just great bush said after watching the shuttle landing 
from a flagdraped observation stand a great day for our 
country the campaigning vice president added standing front and 
center as the space program concluded its first mission since the 
challenger disaster more than two years ago 
a few hours later bush told a campaign rally in redding 
calif that he was committed to development of an operational 
space station by 1996 in remarks prepared for the occasion but not 
delivered he declined to embrace a manned voyage to mars saying 
he wasnt completely certain that planet should be the next 
destination for americans in space 
bush said he was committed to continued manned space exploration 
subject to budgetary considerations 
bush formally hailed the astronauts at a welcoming ceremony a 
few hours earlier saying he was proud to welcome the space 
shuttle discovery back to earth back to america and back to the 
future 
in his prepared remarks bush thanked the astronauts thanked 
the support crews and recalled the seven departed friends who 
will never be forgotten cheering you from above that reference 
to the victims of the challenger disaster more than two years ago 
was the only somber note of a campaign day scripted to accentuate 
the positive 
a few moments after the shuttle landed bushs limousine drove 
across the dry lake bed landing area and deposited him a few feet 
from where the craft stood he walked over to a ramp and while 
television cameras recorded the scene shook hands with the five 
astronauts as they walked down the steps skipper fred hauck came 
first holding a large american flag 
at one point vice presidential chief of staff craig fuller 
gently pulled nasa administrator james fletcher into the background 
so bush would be alone in the pictures of the greeting 
earlier the vice president paused long enough to field a few 
questions from reporters 
he said he had heard rumors that an american hostage was being 
released in lebanon but quickly added theres no way of knowing 
the facts 
he also said he had received a briefing on the shakeup in the 
soviet we keep on keeping on he said we do whats best for 
the united states and if these changes work for the benefit of the 
free world so be it 
in the meantime aides to bush and democratic rival michael 
dukakis said the second presidential debate would go on despite the 
withdrawal of the league of women voters on monday as sponsor 
the bipartisan commission on presidential debates which 
sponsored the first debate 10 days ago in winstonsalem nc said 
it accepted the campaigns invitation and was taking steps to hold 
the debate oct 13 or 14 in los angeles as planned 
the vice president witnessed the shuttle landing as he set out 
on a threeday campaign swing through the west and south bush 
enjoys a lead in the public opinion polls as well as a seeming 
advantage in the electoral college as the campaign enters its final 
five weeks 
california the largest state with 47 electoral votes is rated 
as even and bush made the campaign appearance in redding after 
leaving the nasa complex 
bushs journey to the california desert wasnt the first time he 
has used his office to further his campaign for the white house 
and massachusetts gov dukakis has staged any number of ceremonies 
in his home state to draw attention to his record there 
but the days events had a higher profile that bushs trip to 
the united nations last july or his swearing in of education 
secretary lauro cavazos last month 
this time his schedule placed him at an event that was 
guaranteed massive news coverage and served to associate the vice 
president with the happy news that americas long drought in its 
manned space program is over 
the entire scene was choreographed meticulously by bushs aides 
for maximum television advantage 
he shook hands with each of the five posed for thumbs up 
photograph with the heatblackened shuttle as a backdrop and then 
joined the crew for a walk around the orbiter to see how well it 
withstood four days in space 
he got the red carpet treatment all day 
the vice presidents air force jet was met by fletcher and chuck 
yeagar a wellknown former test pilot as well as california gov 
george deukmejian 
bush watched the shuttle landing from an observation tower 
accompanied by his wife barbara and other nasa officials then 
took a 10minute tour of nasas mission control center before 
driving out to the shuttle and greeting its fivemember crew 
the bushes then were driven to a private lunch with the nasa 
brass and families of the shuttle crew members

attorney melvin bellis accountant did not 
know about a transaction that led to a 3 million tax claim an 
internal revenue service auditor testified monday 
belli 81 maintains that he does not owe back gift taxes and 
penalties on an office building he transferred to his son caesar 
the irs contends the sale of the building was a sham in which no 
money changed hands because the 9000 a month his son was to have 
paid was offset by belli being charged the same amount in rent 
large gifts are taxed against the giver at a higher rate than 
the capital gains tax on a real estate sale 
us tax court judge julian jacobs said he wants the trial 
which resumed monday to conclude this week 
irs auditor david stohlberg testified he met four times over 10 
weeks in 1984 with belli accountant john jones before he received a 
grant deed and promissory note documenting the building transfer 
he said jones told him belli had been difficult and that he 
jones was considering not keeping belli as a client stohlberg 
said jones told him that until the tax examination began he was 
unaware of the transaction 
although the deed showed it was signed in january 1981 it 
wasnt recorded until september 1984 the auditor said the 
discrepancy raised all sorts of questions in my mind he said 
belli has testified that he made out a deed for the building to 
his son on christmas in 1978 but didnt deliver it until 1981 
telling his son to work out the purchase price he said he wanted 
to keep the building in the family but was advised by jones that a 
gift would be taxed prohibitively 
he said that he asked caesar several times during the next three 
years to get the building appraised and to take care of the related 
legal paperwork but nothing happened until 1984 
a deed to the building was recorded with the city in 1984 
listing the date of purchase as 1981 and the price at 14 million 
the irs said the building was worth 24 million in 1981 and 42 
million in 1984 
the irs wants gift taxes and fraud penalties from belli for 
either 12 million 14 million or 3 million depending on 
whether the transfer took place in 1978 1981 or 1984 
in a related case the irs is seeking more than 300000 in back 
taxes and penalties from belli and his estranged wife lia who has 
filed for divorce 
belli sat in the front row of the courtroom with his son 
caesar monday during a break he peeked at an artists sketch and 
when he was asked how he looked belli replied tired

four people have been charged with murder in 
the 5yearold slaying of new york producer roy radin who 
authorities say was embroiled in a soured deal to finance the movie 
the cotton club 
radin disappeared may 13 1983 on his way to a meeting 
concerning the film and his body was found a month later with a 
bullet wound in the head his death authorities said monday was a 
contract killing 
a key figure in negotiations over the film was hollywood 
producer robert evans said deputy district attorney david conn 
and im sure his testimony is going to become important at some 
point 
were not making any allegations against him at this time 
conn said asked if evans producer of such movies as chinatown 
and marathon man remains under investigation conn answered 
yes 
charged with radins murder were karen de layne greenberger 
formerly known as elaine jacobs william molony mentzer alex 
lamota marti and robert ulmer lowe the complaint alleged that 
they killed radin for financial gain 
in addition the complaint charged mentzer lowe and a fifth 
defendant robert leroy deremer with murdering june mincher a 
prostitute conn said the two killings were unrelated except that 
two of the defendants were involved 
conn said the radin slaying resulted from a dispute between 
radin and greenberger about a plan to raise 35 million from 
investors in the puerto rican government for evans production of 
the cotton club 
the prosecutor said radin was introduced to evans by 
greenberger and radin became a middleman in the puerto rican 
negotiations 
but a dispute developed between radin and greenberger over a 
finders fee she was demanding conn said 
we think the individuals felt the deal could go forward 
without radin being involved conn said and it did go forward 
but without the puerto rican investors 
on may 13 1983 he said radin stepped into a limousine rented 
by greenberger with the intention of going to a restaurant and 
discussing the business arrangement further 
he never arrived at the restaurant and his body was found june 
10 1983 in the northwest corner of los angeles county in 
gorman conn said hed been shot in the back of the head 
asked why it had taken so long to bring charges conn said we 
have new evidence thats been uncovered in the course of the 
investigation by the sheriffs department 
conn said the complaint was issued sept 22 but kept sealed 
because of fear for the safety of an informant who has since been 
relocated 
search warrants executed sunday and turned up weapons and 
explosives at the homes of mentzer and marti and at a storage 
locker he said 
conn said mentzer was a private investigator involved in 
security work with marti deremer and lowe 
the complaint alleged special circumstances which could result 
in the death penalty if the defendants are convicted 
greenberger was arrested in florida conn said lowe was 
arrested in maryland where deremer was due to be arrested he 
said mentzer and marti were arrested in los angeles 
in 1980 actressmodel melonie haller claimed radin drugged and 
raped her at gunpoint during one of the frequent parties at his 
mansion on long island east of manhattan 
the actress who appeared in welcome back kotter was found 
dazed and bleeding on a long island rail road train radin who 
pleaded innocent to the rape charges but guilty to possessing a 
handgun was fined 1000 and placed on probation

the costa rican foreign minister said 
monday that no central american nation fulfilled its duties under a 
regional peace plan but singled out nicaragua in particular for 
stepping up its repression 
the progress in this peaceful effort has stopped said 
foreign minister rodrigo madrigal nieto president oscar arias 
sanchez of costa rica won the 1987 nobel peace prize for drafting 
the plan 
the minister speaking in spanish told the 43rd general 
assembly that to a greater or lesser degree none of the states 
that signed the procedure peace plan has complied fully with the 
letter of the agreement 
costa rica has not yet ratified the treaty establishing the 
central american parliament envisaged in the plan madrigal nieto 
noted 
the presidents of nicaragua costa rica honduras guatemala and 
el salvador signed a peace plan aug 7 1987 which has as its main 
goals ceasefires in insurgencies taking place in nicaragua 
guatamala and el salvador amnesty decrees democratization 
measures lifting of emergency or martial laws an end to outside 
military adventurism in the region and an end to using any 
countrys territory by groups or individuals seeking the overthrow 
of a neighboring government 
unfortunately we have to say that over the months we have 
seen the nicaraguan government step up its repression move away 
from fulfilling its commitments and attempt to reduce the crisis to 
a problem of security showing obvious contempt for democratic 
values madrigal nieto said 
the most alarming thing however is that this situation has 
serious repercussions for nicaraguas neighbors who have to take 
in the thousands of people who flee in search of freedom food and 
shelter 
nicaraguas leftist sandinista government has been fighting 
usbacked rebels known as contras since 1981 
madrigal nieto told reporters later speaking in english the 
firm commitment to democracy has not been made by some countries 
and that is the main problem 
i mentioned nicaragua clearly in my speech because i do not 
think they have the political will to carry it the peace process 
on i think they could introduce a lot of changes and they should 
assume some other attitudes more positive ones to see real 
progress 
we think they should not send 40 political leaders to jail as 
they have had 40 people for more than 80 days without due process 
that does not contribute to our efforts to find this diplomatic 
solution above any decision of the united states to fund a 
military solution through the contra rebels he said 
madrigal nieto said such democratic reforms would save nicaragua 
from later counterrevolution by rightists radicalized by 
repression by the sandinistas

the shuttle discovery 
returned to a starspangled welcome from more than 400000 people 
monday after a postchallenger shakedown mission that nasa called 
an absolutely stunning success 
discovery welcome back mission control told commander 
frederick h hauck as he guided the ship to a pictureperfect 
landing after a fourday 16million mile mission a great 
ending to the new beginning of the manned space program 
the national anthem was playing as the white ship with its 
stubby deltashaped wings leveled out and rolled to a smooth stop 
on the center line painted on the hardpacked sand of this desert 
air base it was precisely on time at 937 am pdt 
they were met by their wives here and flew home with them later 
in the day to their training base in houston to an enthusiastic 
reception by about 4000 johnson space center area residents city 
officials and fellow astronauts 
the discovery crew arrived at ellington field in houston in a 
carnival atmosphere complete with flags marching bands and bright 
television lights 
the astronauts and their wives stepped off the aircraft onto a 
red carpet and walked between an honor guard of flagcarrying 
rangerettes from friendswood high school 
earlier the crowd at edwards cheered and waved small american 
flags for the successful completion of a mission that ended a 
32month period in which no manned ship bearing the american flag 
went into space 
vice president george bush on hand for the touchdown thanked 
the astronauts at a ceremony later in the day for putting america 
back in space he said they had shown that the shuttle is a 
strong bird and it could and should fly again 
and referring to the seven who died when the challenger 
exploded bush told the discovery crew i cant help but think 
that just as you had millions cheering for you from below you had 
seven departed friends who will never be forgotten cheering for 
you from above 
mission specialist david c hilmers sounded a common theme for 
his fellow discovery crewmen when he said 
i want you to remember what this flight meant to america i 
want you to remember what america can do when it pulls together and 
has a goal i want you to remember that no matter how hard a 
setback weve had we can bounce back from adversity and i want you 
to remember that we can continue to dream for the future and space 
should be part of those dreams 
earlier nasa administrator james c fletcher called the safe 
return of discovery a banner day for all of us while shuttle 
chief richard truly called the flight an absolutely stunning 
success 
but truly balked at a question that implied that with the new 
success the trauma of the challenger explosion had been overcome 
even when weve flown a few flights we are not going to 
forget the challenger accident he said for the people who 
work in the program thats going to be on their minds for a long 
time 
truly a former astronaut said from cursory inspection the ship 
appeared to have suffered little damage from the rigors of 
launching and returning through the atmosphere a few tiles 
suffered thumbsized nicks he said 
we saw no problems im aware of in any system said arnold 
aldrich who is director of the shuttle program 
for 55 minutes after landing the crew was occupied with 
flipping switches and turning off systems while ground crews moved 
up giant vehicles to safe the vehicle and to remove any 
residual toxic gases 
the flight was nasas first since the challenger mission ended 
tragically 73 seconds after liftoff on jan 28 1986 it was the 
26th flight in the shuttle series 
when the crew emerged hauck was waving an oversized american 
flag and the step railing was festooned with six small flags bush 
waited at the foot of the stairs and welcomed the astronauts 
onebyone pilot richard o covey and mission specialists 
hilmers john m lounge george d nelson 
the astronauts then led the republican presidential candidate 
around the nose of their ship as they performed the traditional 
pilots walkaround 
bushs democratic opponent michael dukakis interrupted a 
speech in hartford conn to let the crowd know the shuttle had 
landed safely america is back in space he said we are 
proud and we are thrilled at its achievements and the courage of 
that crew 
fletcher was asked if the vice presidents presence was 
politicizing the event 
it is not a political visit by the vice president said 
fletcher who was appointed by president reagan he told me he 
didnt want to talk about politics today as far as governor 
dukakis is concerned he was not invited he did not ask to come 
the air force said 109000 vehicles carried an estimated 410000 
people to the public viewing site and that at least 15000 more 
watched from a vip section the largest crowd for a shuttle landing 
was a halfmillion on july 4 1982 when president and mrs reagan 
greeted columbia 
its a beautiful day down there and lots of folks waiting to 
see you land mission control told the astronauts as they 
prepared their return 
the main objectives of the mission had been met last thursday 
first with a safe and successful launch then with deployment of a 
giant 100 million communications satellite afterwards the 
workload for hauck and his crew was a relatively light one nasa 
had scheduled lots of troubleshooting time to reflect the fact 
that more than 400 changes had been made to the shuttle after the 
challenger accident 
it appeared that the shuttle had passed its tests brilliantly 
and hauck commented he had never seen a ship so troublefree 
good systems good performance was the word from mission 
control 
the rocket boosters blamed for the challenger explosion and its 
loss of seven lives performed apparently flawlessly on liftoff 
last thursday although the 149footlong rockets were recovered 
immediately from the atlantic their segments had not yet been 
taken apart for inspection 
hauck and pilot covey guided the 97ton 15 billion spaceship 
to a perfect landing they had fired their braking rockets an hour 
before touchdown to start the freefalling glide halfway around the 
world from 188 miles high 
the flight had a few minor problems a cooling system that had 
given trouble for most of the mission and had the astronauts 
sometimes uncomfortably warm also failed momentarily during 
discoverys plunge to earth 
on touchdown hauck tested new brake and steering systems 
designed to improve performance so that shuttles in the future can 
return to landing at the launch site in florida that evaluation 
too awaited analysis 
moments after the landing rep bill nelson dfla rose on the 
house floor to proclaim that we are back in the nations space 
program 
it has been a psychological lifting of a burden we have been 
carrying for almost three years said nelson who is chairman of 
the house science space subcommittee and was aboard the last 
successful shuttle trip the one before the challenger accident 
we are back and we now were going on to extraordinary 
accomplishments in americas space program he said americans 
have reclaimed the high ground

nearly 5000 wellwishers waving texas and 
american flags turned out at a houston airport monday night to 
welcome home the five discovery astronauts after their mission that 
carried americans back into space 
we were privileged to go around the earth about 64 times since 
we left you commander rick hauck said at ceremonies at houstons 
ellington field 
we saw some beautiful sights and weve lived in a wonderful 
machine and it was wonderful to come back to edwards air force base 
calif but its even more wonderful to come back home he said 
the astronauts strolled from their nasa jets which carried them 
and their wives on a threehour flight from edwards where they 
landed discovery safely earlier in the day 
they walked along a red carpet and through a tunnel of american 
flags some of them pausing to hug their children then they 
climbed a stairway to a blue drapeclad stage backed by a large 
red white and blue sign which proclaimed nasa amp houston back 
on top to stay 
we just got back from the greatest adventure of our lives and 
it was a whole lot of fun mission specialist dave hilmers said 
but you shared this adventure as much as we did and youre just 
as much the heroes as we are 
back in the dark days after the challenger accident folks in 
houston never lost faith in nasa and folks at nasa never lost faith 
in houston lets go back to work tomorrow and make this adventure 
happen again and again and again 
the welcome home was a far cry from the return to houston 
shuttle astronauts had become accustomed to in flights before the 
challenger accident the return had become so routine that only a 
handful of family members and friends were on hand to greet them 
mondays event however was intended to show the support of the 
houstonarea communities for the space program organizers said 
we want to welcome you back as neighbors houston mayor kathy 
whitmire said 
we had a special ceremony out at edwards and that was kind of 
welcome home for the country and it was very special mission 
specialist pinky nelson said but this is more special because 
were coming home to our friends and coworkers and the people who 
made it happen 
a high school band and flagwaving troupe entertained the crowd 
in the hours before the astronauts arrived at the same field where 
a week ago they left for florida and the launch of discovery 
this is much like the first flights return said gerry 
griffin former director of the johnson space center and now 
president of the greater houston chamber of commerce one of the 
organizers of monday airport event 
tommy and molly lowe of houston brought their two small 
children to the airfield and waited nearly four hours for the 
astronauts its worth it mrs lowe said 
lowe said his daughter megan was born 2 years ago and arrived 
home from the hospital the day the challenger exploded you feel 
like it was part of you on the shuttle he said 
weve watched it from the start to finish mrs lowe said of 
discoverys mission we were on pins and needles but this is 
just a part of american pride

the us supreme court on monday 
refused to lift a federal appeals court order blocking the 
execution of a convicted murderer who wanted all appeals dropped 
gerald smith who was scheduled to be the first inmate put to 
death by missouri since 1965 had asked that no appeals be made to 
delay his execution by lethal injection scheduled for 1201 am 
tuesday 
smith was sentenced for the 1980 bludgeoning death of a former 
girlfriend in st louis 
the supreme court upheld the 8th us circuit court of appeals 
which voted 82 late monday to block smiths execution rejecting 
the states efforts to lift a stay issued earlier in the day by a 
threejudge panel of the court 
state attorney general william websters office filed a petition 
with the nations highest court late monday asking that the stay be 
lifted said spokesman john baker 
smith telephoned the associated press to complain about the 
stay he said lawyers and judges were needlessly questioning his 
competency and putting him and his wife through more turmoil by 
delaying the execution 
its not me theyre concerned about they just dont believe 
in the death penalty smith said they may end up being sorry 
i wont elaborate on that whatever happens from here on out would 
be their responsibility 
i was ready to go smith said i was ready to meet my 
maker and i was at peace with myself im not sure i will be at 
peace with myself when my time comes again 
the threejudge panel issued a stay in response to a petition by 
the missouri public defender commission claiming smith may not be 
competent to decide on making appeals 
the execution was scheduled to be carried out at one minute 
after midnight so that if it was blocked prosecutors would have 
more than 23 hours under the tuesday death warrant to try to have 
the stay lifted 
authorities at the missouri state penitentiary proceeded monday 
as though the execution would take place said spokesman dale riley 
in their order staying the execution the three judges said more 
time was needed to review an affidavit from a psychiatrist 
questioning whether smith was competent to make decisions on his 
fate 
in an interview friday at the prison smith said he considers 
all further appeals hopeless and criticized outside efforts to stop 
the execution 
asked how he would react if a court stepped in and blocked it 
smith said they can only block it for so long everythings been 
resolved theyre going over the same things because they have 
nothing else to go over 
smith complained friday about the public defender appeal saying 
it inaccurately said his wife had influenced him to drop appeals 
smith ruled competent by a federal judge two years ago said he 
had made the decision before he met his wife whom he married in 
prison last year 
smith was convicted of using an eightpound iron bar to beat to 
death karen roberts a woman he said had given him a venereal 
disease and caused him to lose his fiancee he was given a second 
death penalty for his part in the 1985 stabbing murder of fellow 
death row inmate robert baker 
the states emergency motion filed in response to the stay noted 
that last week a different threejudge panel of the 8th circuit 
had refused to block the execution 
the panel should not allow such a collateral attack upon their 
opinion the states motion said 
gov john ashcroft issued a statement saying that a review of 
smiths record by the state board of probation and parole provided 
no new information that would prompt him to step in and block the 
execution

carter 64 called for peace talks supervised by the un 
security council to resolve disputes in the middle east and said 
wealthy nations should donate 15 billion to fund any agreements 
stemming from the proposed forum 
the palestinians must publicly accept israel as a nation with 
a permanent existence and must renounce violence said carter 
who also urged israel to respect basic human rights and 
selfdetermination for the plestinians

for a nuclear war between the united states and the soviet union 
the soviet union and the united states have allies and friends 
in that region who are unpredictable and uncontrollable he said 
there is no way to have an easy solution to the problems of 
the middle east but the overwhelming majority of people there want 
peace and justice 
he condemned israel for using plastic bullets in the 10month

the massachusetts supreme judicial court on monday 
dismissed an appeal by an antiabortion group seeking to put a 
question on the states november ballot about whether human life 
begins at conception 
the justices of the states highest court issued the dismissal 
without explanation saying they wanted to make the decision known 
by the ballots printing deadline but needed more time to write 
their opinion or opinions 
until we find out the courts reasons i dont know what to 
say except that i am greatly disappointed said john rankin head 
of the new england christian action council which sponsored the 
ballot question 
susan newsom spokeswoman of the planned parenthood league of 
massachusetts said the court had made a good ruling 
i am not surpised at all at that decision the referendum 
did not fit the criteria at all for a public policy question 
the question would have asked voters to define in biological 
terms when life begins it gave three possible answers 
conception viability or birth and a writein option where 
voters could specify a different biological term 
state attorney general james shannon had ruled the nonbiding 
referendum improper saying it failed to give a clear directive to 
lawmakers and was ambiguous 
rankin said the questions objective was to develop a consensus 
on when human life begins to redress what he considers a failing to 
answer the question in the landmark roe vs wade us supreme court 
decision allowing abortions 
although rankins group was unable to get the question on the 
1988 massachusetts ballot rankin found success in being able to 
collect nearly 26000 signatures for his ballot petition 
i think what we have done so far is redefined the debate on 
the issue from one typically limited to government funding for 
abortions to a broader question he said

an executive council member whose own vote could 
have given him a tie in his reelection primary learned monday 
that a missing absentee ballot has turned up 
herbert connolly who has served in the obscure state office 
since 1969 failed in a court bid to halt the printing of ballots 
for the november election which went to the printer monday bearing 
his rivals name 
but connolly won an expedited hearing in superior court after he 
learned that a stillsealed absentee ballot was found in brookline 
town hall 
connolly said he was late getting to the polls on sept 15 and 
failed to cast a vote for himself in the democratic primary 
so it was his own fault when a recount showed that connolly had 
lost the democratic nomination for a seat on the executive council 
by just one vote 
the recount showed connolly with 14715 votes his opponent 
lowell city councilor robert b kennedy got 14716 
the 67yearold car dealer said he had been campaigning in the 
neighboring city of waltham on election day and i waited until 
the last minute to race over to vote 
the eightmember governors council which dates from the 
colonial era lost many of its powers in the 1960s its chief 
remaining duties are to approve criminal pardons and confirm judges 
nominated by gov michael s dukakis 
in any event failing to vote was not connollys only blunder 
shortly before the primary he placed a newspaper advertisement 
urging his supporters to get to the polls on sept 14 the election 
was sept 15 
connollys lawyer state rep william galvin former house 
chairman of the legislatures committee on election laws said the 
lost ballot could be blank 
if it is opened and allowed and shows a vote for kennedy giving 
him a twovote margin galvin said he would still contest the 
outcome 
if the mystery ballot was cast for connolly galvin said the 
resulting tie would have to be broken by a vote of the ward and 
town democratic committees in connollys district 
this is really a very interesting situation observed deputy 
secretary of state martin meehan

republican base across the south and rocky mountain west the

himself and the democrats in texas although dukakis is waging an

consideration for me greene said abby is very straight 
someone who does everything the right way abby gets all the 
heartwrenchers shes inhibited not expressive emotionally 
reserved 
in the movie im a girl from a crazy italian family a very 
demonstrative family they yell they cry my character is kind of 
nuts we meet her when shes under stress and everything goes 
wrong i like to play a character like that abby would avoid a 
confrontation this character will call someone at 6 in the morning 
and say we have to talk about this 
the twohour movie has a cast that looks like a whoswho of 
sitcoms the groom is scott valentine of family ties the best 
man is mark linnbaker of perfect strangers others include 
barbara billingsley leave it to beaver eileen brennan 
private benjamin joel brooks my sister sam john

made me an offer i laughed when i read the script halfway through 
it i called my agent and said i wanted to do it 
the movies wedding brings together two families who take an 
instant dislike to each other greenes boisterous brood and 
valentines snobs and social climbers all try to sabotage the 
wedding

were the dramatic scenes of the bride and groom trying to work out 
their differences too many people think marriage is an arrival 
its really the beginning of the trip 
greene spent quite a bit of time in her wedding dress for 
going to the chapel 
the first time i put it on it was so pretty so beautiful 
she said by the third day when theyd bring it in id say im 
not putting that thing on until the last minute we did the 
picture in july and it was so hot the dress came up to my neck

by steven bochco the executive producer and cocreator of the 
emmywinning series she had previously worked with bochco on the 
shortlived series about a minorleague baseball team bay city 
blues she played the wife of a ballplayer played by perry lang

the stalled iraniraq peace talks have 
left tens of thousands of prisoners of the iraniraq war 
languishing in camps waiting for freedom that may be months even 
years away 
foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran who heads his 
countrys delegation at the talks said in a recent tehran radio 
interview monitored in nicosia were trying to get an exchange 
of pows arranged as quickly as possible 
but united nations officials said the issue has still had not 
been discussed at the monthold peace talks when they went into 
their stall 
when a prisoner exchange does come off however it will be the 
biggest organized by the international committee of the red cross 
since the geneva convention of 1949 
the red cross has registered 50182 prisoners held by iran and 
19284 by iraq but un officials and diplomats in baghdad and 
tehran believe iran holds 60000 to 70000 prisoners and iraq 
30000 to 50000 
the pows include hundreds of iranian boy soldiers many of whom 
have been held since the early days of the 8yearold war and have 
grown up in captivity 
the soviet union held thousands of germans after world war ii 
the last 9000 were only released in 1955 after the soviets and 
west germans agreed to establishing diplomatic relations 
iran has freed a handful of disabled iraqis since a ceasefire 
took effect aug 20 
but iraq has freed none and has even added to its tally by 
seizing more than 700 iranians in september in what tehran claims 
was a major ceasefire violation 
un observers have confirmed the iranians were captured but so 
far have not been able to secure their release 
iraqs information minister latif nayef jassim said his 
countrymen are opening their arms wide to welcome home the pows 
held by iran 
but some diplomats fear that both sides will try to use the 
prisoners as bargaining chips in the peace talks that bogged down 
almost as soon as they began over sovereignty of the shatt alarab 
waterway and troop withdrawals 
the pows appear to have become pawns in the propaganda war 
between iran and iraq that has swelled since the peace talks began 
aug 25 in geneva 
iraq stung by international condemnation for its alleged use of 
outlawed chemical weapons against kurdish rebels has intensified 
accusations that the iranians have tortured killed and brainwashed 
iraqi pows iran has made similar charges 
jassim recently accused the iranians of inhuman practices 
starting with mass executions and ending with psychological 
torture 
the official iraqi news agency quoted him as saying in a 
statement the savagery of irans rulers and their mad practices 
against iraqi pows has caused the death of a large number of them 
thirty disabled iraqi pows released by iran in early september 
recently told a baghdad news conference that their iranian guards 
systematically torture prisoners and pressure them to switch 
allegiances like most iranians many iraqis are shiite moslems 
christians among the iraqi pows were singled out and subjected 
to extreme maltreatment and pressure to convert to islam by their 
shiite guards the expows said 
when i told them i was a christian they asked me to convert 
to islam before they would give me any medical help said wad 
aziz namou who told reporters he was captured in january 1987 
after he was wounded in the eyes during an iranian offensive 
i refused and they left me without treatment i lost both 
eyes many of the christian soldiers were forced to convert to 
islam under psychological pressure and torture 
the prisoners account could not be independently confirmed with 
other sources or raised with iranian officials because of limited 
access western news organizations have with tehran 
a prisoner exchange could also be hampered by thousands of pows 
held by both sides who do not want to return to their homelands or 
who fear persecution once back home 
a un report in august said officials who visited some of the 
15 known pow camps in iran reported that they appeared to be run 
internally by iraqi shiites who had switched allegiance to 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
the report said that as many as 20 percent of the iraqi pows 
seen by the officials appeared to be defectors tehran newspapers 
have said up to 20000 iraqi prisoners have opted to stay in iran 
the un report added that many pows on both sides fear 
persecution if they go home and said iraqi prisoners might riot if 
repatriation is attempted 
many iranians were also hesitant about being exchanged the 
report said

the talk of lisbon these days is about 
the chiado the 10block area of 19thcentury department stores and 
shops swept by fire aug 25 
most of the talk centers on the chiados future in the heart of 
the city 
will it be restored to what it was will modern highrises win 
out 
i think they will have to preserve the facades of the district 
it will have to look like it did before said joao bento a 
26yearold bank employee 
experts say facades of 18 of the 20 buildings damaged by the 
fire are restorable 
even while the embers were still glowing on rua do carmo and rua 
garrett many lisbonites began to worry that municipal authorities 
would commission an upmarket highrise development on the ashes 
no one can have the illusion the chiado will be what it was 
said alvaro siza vieira an architect recently appointed by mayor 
nuno kruz abecasis to plan the restoration even the dirt 
engrained on the tiled facades was part of the atmosphere 
but siza vieira is not seen as likely to suggest a sprawling 
hitech plan and has made his proposals subject to vetting by the 
portuguese architects association 
but whatever form it takes the new chiado is expected to 
point the way for the rest of this historic city whose buildings 
exhibit a ravishing collage of architectural styles but are in dire 
need of restoration 
pedro brandao secretary general of the architects association 
said the organization wants a competition among local architects to 
form a development team for the whole historic area of the baixa 
lisbons lower city that was destroyed in the 1755 earthquake and 
of which the chiado is just one part 
but chiado watchers have concerns other than architecture 
provided the proposed plan does not involve complexes of apartments 
of glass and aluminum 
author jose victor adragao for example maintains that the 
chiado is cherished as much as anything else for its air sounds 
smell of violets and roasting chestnuts strolls and sandwiches 
before the opera and because it is lisbon 
goncalo ribeiro teles city council member for the 
ecologyconscious monarchist party cautions in other parts of 
the city big businesses and banks have sprung up where cafes and 
restaurants once were and have killed the city the offices close 
early people leave and the area dies 
insurers say the inferno caused 300 million in material damage 
but the lisbon shopkeepers association estimates losses at double 
that figure 
many small shopkeepers were underinsured at the time of the 
fire and might not be able to afford to move into a new chiado 
commercial center despite cheap loans from a 325million 
government credit line offered to traders to help them get back in 
business 
the lack of cash could also cast a pall on ribeiro teles hopes 
of handing back new chiado apartments to the areas preblaze 
residents who benefited from longstanding rent control 
new apartments on expensive city center ground mean new leases 
and higher rents forcing former lowincome residents out of a new 
residential chiado the fire rendered 300 people homeless and left 
1200 shopworkers unemployed two people were killed in the fire 
and 43 were injured 
alternative plans to keep the chiado alive would be hotels or 
student accommodations 
one banker said he had already received hundreds of phone calls 
from investors mainly japanese and germans asking to secure 
pockets of land in the neighborhood 
but the problem ribeiro teles said involves the whole of 
lisbons historic zone and is vaster and much more serious than 
that of the chiado 
brandao agrees 
for the chiago to recuperate great amounts of money are not 
needed but to restore all the historic part of lisbon we need 
a lot and we dont have enough for that in all of portugal

since airline deregulation became law a decade 
ago some fares have been cut and flights have been added to major 
cities but the average passenger also has less help in coping with 
travel problems 
the civil aeronautics board that formerly watched out for 
passengers interests is no more and while its functions were 
switched to other agencies consumer protection is less visible 
than in years past 
buying an airline ticket today amounts to signing a contract 
between the passenger and the airline both have rights and 
responsibilities and the airline consumer action project one of 
the publicinterest groups founded by ralph nader has prepared a 
booklet to help 
facts amp advice for airline passengers can be obtained for 2 
by writing to aviation consumer action project po box 19029 
washington dc 20036 
the government too has a pamphlet for fliers entitled fly 
rights which costs 1 from the consumer information center 
pueblo colo 81009 order booklet 156t 
air fares can be confusing with changes being made constantly 
and promotional tickets with low prices and many restrictions being 
advertised 
as with any purchase getting the best price generally means 
shopping around find out which airlines fly where you want to go 
and compare their prices 
a good travel agent can be a big help but finding the right 
agent also takes some work check with several agents and see if 
one comes up with the lowest priced fares consistently suggests 
the airline consumer action project 
flexible travel plans also are important in getting the best 
price that group points out 
ask about discounted prices for flights that leave at various 
times night flights are often cheaper as are weekend prices on 
routes frequently used by business travelers during the week 
travel to vacation resorts is sometimes cheaper monday through 
thursday since the weekend flights are more popular and 
offseason fares also save money 
beware of restrictions and nonrefundable tickets they may be 
cheapest but you may not be allowed to change your plans and if 
you cant make the flight at all a nonrefundable ticket is 
worthless 
many airlines offer lower rates for military personnel 
children students senior citizens and clergy so folks in those 
categories should ask 
there are many other travel considerations discussed in the 
booklets including being bumped lost luggage delayed and canceled 
flights and smoking rules 
in the end what it comes down to is the need for alert consumers 
and if a problem develops some constructive complaining 
most airlines have someone at each airport to contend with 
problems often with the authority to pay compensation for bumping 
and to write small checks to settle claims for lost or damaged 
baggage 
if no one is available or they cant help complain directly to 
the airlines office of consumer affairs keep the letter short and 
businesslike stating the problem and what you want the company to 
do about it be warned however that if you make excessive demands 
many airlines wont take the matter seriously 
if after writing and negotiating the airline still declines to 
resolve the complaint consumers can file a lawsuit or complain to 
local and federal government agencies 
while government officials cant force airlines to settle 
bringing them in may help consumers can contact state and local 
consumer affairs offices and also can write to the consumer affairs 
division room 10405 office of community and consumer affairs

once derided as weekend warriors and beset with 
various image problems the national guard today is at record 
strength better equipped and better trained abroad as well as at 
home while some regulars still grumble the pentagons total force 
battle plan puts the guard and the reserves into full 
partnership with other combat forces is the guard ready here is

camp blanding fla beyond the canopy of live oak trees you 
can hear the sporadic thumping of 105mm howitzers down near the 
titanium mine a gaggle of clattering tanks is kicking up a cloud of 
white dust a column of rat patrol jeeps with machinegunners 
standing at their mounted m60s bounces through the palmetto and 
scrub brush 
the gator brigade trained in the jungles of central america to 
defend the panama canal is back in camp 
its one of the refurbished national guard combat units prepared 
to go to battle within days part of a strike force of state 
militias learning to fight in foreign lands 58 different countries 
in the past year in fact from panama to saudi arabia from korea 
to west germany 
not since bunker hill has americas oldest military force been 
counted on so heavily to provide a first line of defense never in 
its 352year history most military authorities agree has the 
national guard been stronger better equipped better trained in 
peacetime 
spec 4 jeff cleveland is flat on his belly at the firing range 
polishing his marksmanship with the m60 the machine gun he calls 
your primary killing weapon 
id go into battle with these guys in a heartbeat says 
cleveland 22 who recently joined the guard after he finished a 
threeyear hitch in the army and returned to stuart to help run his 
familys nursery they know what theyre doing these weapons are 
in better shape than we had in korea and youre a lot closer to the 
enemy in korea 
the national guard traces its heritage to the formation of three 
regiments in the massachusetts bay colony in 1636 it has 
traditionally had a dual role as a state militia commanded by the 
governor and as part of the national defense force 
today with the guard playing a greater role in national 
defense many officials are concerned about the home front in case 
the guard is mobilized for federal duty 23 states plus puerto 
rico and the district of columbia have organized state defense 
forces available to help out in emergencies such as natural 
disasters and civil disturbances like the home guard of world war 
i and the state guard of world war ii in event of allout war 
they would also be available to guard hydrolectric dams nuclear 
plants and communications installations 
the structure and strength of the state defense forces varies 
widely from state to state ranging from largely social 
organizations whose members are not allowed to carry guns and must 
buy their own uniforms to serious military organizations with 
strict training requirements none of the defense force members 
mostly retired military personnel is paid 
there is considerable debate over just how much control if any 
the defense department should have and who should pay the bills 
ninetyfive percent of the air and army guards annual 9 billion 
budget is federal money 
back in the woods at camp blanding is a command tent hidden by a 
camouflage net and guarded by coils of razor wire a sentry with an 
m16 rifle demands the password there judge richard g weinberg is 
holding court in battle dress the new germanstyle kevlar helmet 
on his head his face smeared with blackandgreen greasepaint 
hes also wearing the star of a brigadier general as commander of 
the 4300 troops of the 53rd infantry brigade the gator brigade 
the gator brigade is one of the national guard units that train 
regularly in central america a practice that has drawn objections 
even lawsuits from several state governors who contend that the 
state militia should not be used as a tool of us foreign policy 
but some units of the 53rd have been undergoing annual twoweek 
training in latin america since 1972 mostly in panama but also in 
honduras ecuador peru and elsewhere 
weinberg a circuit judge from st augustine and veteran of the 
82nd airborne and the special forces figures he has been to panama 
about 20 times over the past five years and knows the terrain 
like the back of my hand 
should hostilities break out in panama we could deploy there 
in three to four days he says and if you have to mobilize and 
physically go to those regions in an emergency its a lot better 
to train by actually loading the aircraft and moving out as opposed 
to practicing it at an armory somewhere 
send the national guard into battle on foreign soil in three to 
four days 
thats the pentagons total force battle plan which puts the 
national guard and the reserves in full partnership with the 
regular army and air force counted on to provide about half the 
manpower in a war some guard combat units would be on the front 
lines within a few days with the rest to follow within 30 to 60 
days some units would reach the battlefield even before their 
regular army partners 
it was not but a few years ago that they said we couldnt 
fight our way out of a paper bag and here were on the spearhead 
of an invasion says lt gen herbert r temple jr chief of the 
national guard bureau the liaison with the defense department 
baby weve come a long way 
half a million national guard troops have trained overseas in 
the past few years at an average of 40000 to 50000 a year many 
participating with the regular army in such exercises as reforger 
in europe and team spirit in south korea 
they are doing such things as building roads and supplying 
medical care in central america and flying airlifts to the south 
pole a team of selected volunteers from the gator brigade went 
through a french commando school in martinique this summer during 
a reforger exercise a signal brigade from florida opened up a line 
of military communications across belgium the first time that has 
been done since world war ii a florida special forces battalion 
staged a nighttime parachute drop into germany

and never has the national guard had more soldiers to throw into 
combat including world war i when 379000 guardsmen hit the 
trenches or world war ii when 300000 served 
todays guard manpower is at a record level almost at full 
strength with 460000 in 2043 units in the army national guard 
and 115000 in 642 air national guard units thats about 100000 
more than even during the vietnam war when many young men joined 
the guard to avoid the draft 
the fact that sen dan quayle of indiana the republican vice 
presidential nominee served in the guard during that period drew 
some political fire including allegations which he denied that 
his way into the guard was eased by family influence 
todays young men and women who were only children when the 
vietnam war was going on are joining the guard for a number of 
reasons including an apparent resurgence of patriotism the 
adventure of travel to foreign countries and to fatten their 
wallets 
under the 1987 montgomery gi bill guardsmen are now eligible 
for free college tuition after they sign up for eight years and 
complete their initial six months of basic training they can get 
up to 140 a month for up to 36 months fulltime education they 
also get yearround commissary privileges not just for the periods 
they are in training a private makes 8952 for one weekend for 
example and a staff sergeant gets 19437 
a national guardsman must train a minimum of 39 days a year 
including an annual 15day period and one weekend a month and with 
todays global exercises many volunteer for extra duty on average 
guard officials say enlisted personnel train about 49 days a year 
and officers 79 days a year 
we are doing exciting things that we did not do before says 
maj gen robert c thrasher adjutant general of california whose 
26yearold son joined the guard and a college rotc program partly 
because of the free tuition payments 
also i think patriotism is returning to a degree to my son 
vietnam is kind of a shadow in the past something that happened in 
history 
president lyndon johnson decided against largescale 
mobilization of the guard for vietnam of the 34 million sent to 
southeast asia in that war only 22745 were guardsmen johnson 
feared it would lead to more public pressure to bring the boys 
home if entire hometown units were sent to war 
johnsons decision didnt make a lot of guard officers happy 
i think it was a very stupid decision on his part says maj 
gen francis r gerard new jerseys bluntspoken adjutant general 
the last of the world war ii ace fighter pilots still on active 
duty thats what were in the business for 
once derided as weekend warriors and armed with sometimes 
defective handmedown weapons todays guardsman frequently trains 
alongside his regular army counterpart with topoftheline 
weaponry such as the abrams m1 tank the m2 bradley fighting 
vehicle and the roland air defense missile 
the air national guard which provides most of the air defense 
of the united states with two fighterinterceptors on 24hour 
alert at each of 22 locations also has benefited from the military 
buildup of the reagan years 
today the air guard is in basically the very same firstline 
equipment that the active air force is in f15s f16s brand new 
c130s says maj gen john b conaway director of the air 
national guard 
like the army guard the air guard is a full partner in the 
total force participating in global exercies air guard fighters 
are frequently scrambled to intercept soviet bear bombers 
approaching us air space air guard tankers provided airtoair 
refueling during the strikes at grenada and libya 
while the guard is better equipped than it ever has been there 
are still some shortages 
we need more of it just as the active forces do and much of 
the vietnamera equipment is beginning to age says dan donahue 
spokesman for the national guard bureau but yes we get 
firstline equipment right off the assembly line 
not long off the assembly line was a 5 million q36 radar 
directing the gator brigades artillery fire at this 65000acre 
national guard training base in a sparsely populated area of 
northcentral florida the hightech machine was in the care of 
chief warrant officer george howard of plant city an ibm 
technician in civilian life a korean veteran who joined the guard 
at age 16 hes seen firsthand the transformation of the guard 
over the years 
brother theres no comparison he says the training is 
so much more intense we used to meet once a week and drink beer 
and play cards now we hit the ground running 
how do the regulars the professionals the west pointers react 
to this partnership with parttime soldiers 
gen john r galvin who started out as a private in the 
massachusetts national guard and is now commander of the us and 
nato forces in europe had this to say after observing a national 
guard unit at the certain challenge exercise in west germany in 
late september 
i really have come to appreciate the guard and the reserve 
he said im really high on them after what i have seen out here 
the reserve components are bigger in size than the active 
components so they are absolutely of the first importance to us 
but many regular army officers grumble off the record that 
guardsmen are after all only parttime soldiers and they are not 
ready to accept them as equals 
a senior guard official who didnt want to be identified by 
name put it this way 
its like being black and living down south they may not like 
us but there are a lot of us and weve got a lot of votes

i think there is genuine respect for the ability of the 
guard says spokesman donahue i think on the other hand 
there is concern perhaps justifiable concern over how many 
missions you can shift to the guard just because its an economical 
way to do it 
the army national guards budget of 5 billion for 1988 
excluding equipment is only 64 percent of the total army budget 
the army cannot go to war without the national guard and they 
recognize this says maj gen donald burdick director of the 
army national guard 
specifically under the armys capstone mobilization plan 
which was first conceived in the late 1970s when many guard units 
were at less than 65 percent of their authorized strength the 
army national guard accounts for 10 of the total forces 28 combat 
divisions in addition upon mobilization it will round out 
eight of the regular armys divisions providing a brigade for each 
the army reserve would provide mostly support units 
would the national guard officers themselves be comfortable 
taking their citizensoldiers into battle on short notice 
yeah says maj gen robert f ensslin jr the adjutant 
general of florida who served in the artillery in the korean war 
the 53rd infantry brigade is so much better trained and equipped 
than any force in central america including the sandinistas that 
i have no doubt they would acquit themselves well 
in its report to secretary of defense frank carlucci for fiscal 
year 1987 the reserve forces policy board an advisory group 
comprised mainly of generals said 
the reserve components in this decade have made unprecedented 
progress toward readiness goals in the areas of personnel 
training equipment and mobilization preparedness the guard and 
the reserve the board said are capable of accomplishing their 
wartime missions 
but the board pointed out they are expected to maintain 
mobilization readiness in less than 20 percent of the time 
available to active components 
in tests of basic combat skills conducted by regular army 
evaluators army national guardsmen fall about 2 to 3 percentage 
points behind the regulars donahue says as far as the air 
national guard is concerned he says you cant tell the 
difference 
there are problems while national guard units are being 
equipped under the first to fight first to equip policy 
instituted by former secretary of defense casper weinberger there 
are shortages of certain items such as 2 and 5ton trucks 
critical shortages still exist in the areas of communications 
and electronics equipment tactical and support vehicles engineer 
equipment and individual weapons says the report from the 
reserve forces policy board 
it estimated the dollar value of the shortages of equipment for 
the guard and the reserves at 147 billion 
also most of the aging trucks used by the guard run on 
gasoline while most of the armys vehicles use diesel fuel an 
obvious logistical problem on the battlefield 
the national guard is also trying to live down the stigma of 
past scandals especially involving the misuse of government planes 
and construction equipment by some state adjutants general 
maj gen vito castellano the former adjutant general of new 
york who admitted he was a liar usurer and bigamist was sentenced 
earlier this year to up to three years in prison on tax charges 
there was a certain amount of distress on the part of various 
members of the organized militia to see their former commander in 
the public dock as a criminal says maj gen lawrence p flynn 
who succeeded castellano as new yorks top militiaman 
symbolic of the new guard in more ways than one is 1st lt 
pauline beiswanger an rotc graduate of the university of south 
florida who has trained in panama several times with the gator 
brigade and volunteers to go back every chance she gets 
in a military organization that once was an allmale club she 
is one of at least two husbandwife teams in the brigade her 
husband is capt william beiswanger an infantry company commander 
and when theyre not playing war games they run a restaurant in 
holiday fla 
mrs beiswanger who also works parttime as a substitute 
schoolteacher is one of about 26000 women in the national guard 
and one of the 2700 female officers she doesnt mind the rugged 
training 
from the day you hit camp youre in the field she says 
i sleep out there and do everything and i dont think anything 
about it i dont think you find gender bias in the national 
guard 
maj peter paul of st augustine an aide to brig gen 
weinberg has a wife named mary a sergeant on the staff of the 
adjutant general he doesnt make her salute in private but he 
endures a lot of jokes about peter paul and mary 
then theres pvt yvette velasquez of orlando a petite woman of 
20 who is in camp for the first time with the gator brigade a 
nervous pvt benjamin in her camouflaged bdu battle dress 
uniform kevlar helmet and streaked face what is she doing in the 
national guard 
i wanted a change in my life a challenge she says 
besides im the only female in my family who had the guts to do

the civilian visitors troop 
into the green army squad tent one by one pausing at the entrance 
to slake thirsts born of a tropic sun with paper cupfuls of 
koolaid 
they have come by helicopter to this dusty camp in a remote 
northern honduran valley to see for themselves the work of task 
force iii of the us army national guard 
using charts and maps on easel boards the task force commander 
col eldridge casto jr and his aides explain their mission to 
build the final seven miles of a 34mile road into the yoro valley 
casto a spare man with a west virginia drawl speaks with pride 
of the men and women under his command who have moved thousands 
upon thousands of cubic yards of earth crushed ton upon ton of 
rock into gravel and forced a formidable path across towering 
mountains 
he speaks too of the hundreds of doctors and nurses of the 
national guard who have gone into dozens of remote villages to 
vaccinate and treat men women children cows horses goats 
sheep dogs and cats for an array of exotic ailments seldom seen in 
the united states 
it is invaluable experience the colonel tells his visitors 
it is something we simply cant get at home 
so for three years running thousands of national guard members 
have come to honduras in the novembertojune dry season to work 
for two weeks alongside regular us army and honduran soldiers on 
a project once known as blazing trails86 and now called 
fuertes caminos88 the spanish name means strong roads 
when work is completed in a few days casto says the yoro 
valley will for the first time be open to the outside world 
permitting access to new markets by its peasant farmers and 
creating the possibility of development in one of the poorest parts 
of one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere 
the humanitarian aspects of this project are immeasurable 
the colonel tells his listeners who include a bank president from 
sardis miss a state representative from washington and a 
professor from the georgia institute of technology 
his guests this day number 28 many are community leaders back 
home and they have been flown to honduras in a military version of 
a boeing 727 with an escort that includes lt gen herbert r 
temple jr chief of the national guard bureau in washington dc 
in three days of briefings and tours they will be told of 
national guard training exercises that cannot be duplicated in the 
united states of the good that comes from accompanying civic 
action programs that range from drilling wells and constructing 
latrines to building orphanages and schools 
they will see with their own eyes the shy grateful smiles of 
hondurans in one of 80 tiny northern villages as they receive 
periodic medical and dental care from a team of regular army 
national guard and local doctors dentists and nurses 
when the visitors return home it is hoped they will carry what 
they have seen and heard to political associates civic clubs 
church groups and the like for the national guard is increasingly 
under fire for conducting training missions abroad and needs all 
the friends it can get 
the road being built by the national guard is not simply a 
farmtomarket route designed to bring progress to an isolated 
valley it is a military road built to the specifications of 
honduran army engineers and designed to carry the heavy weapons of 
war trucks artillery even tanks 
and the hondurans wanted this road in this particular place 
because the yoro valley has for years been the inaccessible hiding 
place of a small but persistent band of leftist insurgents 
it is the national guards involvement however tangential in 
the internal and even foreign affairs of other countries that has 
troubled some americans several governors including 
massachusetts michael dukakis the democratic presidential 
candidate have objected to foreign training of their state 
militias arguing that they are being used for a purpose they were 
never designed to fulfill the projection of us policy abroad 
american political influence and the presence of us military 
personnel in honduras including the 1200 members of task force 
bravo permanently stationed at palmerola air base also bothers many 
hondurans it goes hand in glove with their dislike of the 
usbacked contra rebels who have been operating out of base camps 
in honduras for more than six years in an attempt to overthrow the 
communist government of neighboring nicaragua

despite vastly improved equipment and more 
intense training during the military buildup of the reagan years 
americas national guard still has an image problem 
the regular army still isnt quite ready to accept the new guard 
as its equal in the total force battle plan 
theyre not exactly an orphan any more says a top pentagon 
official who did not want to be identified but theyre still a 
poor relation 
realistically how do you integrate train and equip a 
parttime guard on a par with a fulltime force i think you can 
count on them to fight but for the most part you cant count on 
them in the very first wave of the war 
says one army officer theyre better but theyre not ready 
to saddle up and fight as soon as the rest of my division gets the 
call 
adds another theyre still parttime soldiers thats what 
theyre supposed to be and thats what they are 
on the other hand gen john r galvin commander of the us 
and nato forces in europe observed a national guard unit training 
in west germany in late september and commented later im really 
high on them after what i have seen out here 
military officers on both sides of the fence agree the national 
guard is a much more credible fighting force today than perhaps at 
any point in peacetime history 
they cite a real push to modernize guard units betterquality 
recruits worldwide training yearround instead of summer camp 
at home and a serious effort to require guard units to meet the 
same type of readiness standards as active units 
lt col john chapla a spokesman for the activeduty army at 
the pentagon says the parent service is convinced that attitudes 
are changing as the guards warfighting ability improves 
generally speaking the ability of the guard and reserve to 
work with the activeduty units has been significantly improved 
chapla says we are now better prepared to go to war as a total 
army 
and with those improvements the attitudes about the guard 
being just weekend warriors are dying out the attitudes are 
changing we are not going to be able to go to war and fight 
effectively without significant participation by guard and reserve 
components 
thats the official line and things have improved but old 
attitudes die hard counters a national guard officer who like a 
halfdozen other officers and officials agreed to comment if not 
identified 
you can see it when they watch us train theres still a kind 
of snobbery 
im sure the questions still linger in the minds of the 
decisionmakers how reliable are they how wellled are they 
says another guard officer 
what about the air guard the other half of the national guard 
officers in the field and in washington express no doubts about its 
fighting readiness 
the relationship between the guard and air force has always 
been different one official says youve got flyboys who flew 
for the active force are still flying today for airlines and 
keeping their hands in flying fighters on the weekends 
the air guard almost always has to be with the active force 
for training while the army national guard can train in their back 
yard observes an army guard officer thats an important 
difference 
and they tend to be flying every day in their civilian jobs 
too the guys in that army guard unit arent smelling ordnance 
every day you cant be a recreational artilleryman but those air 
guard guys never stop flying and the active crews recognize that 
the army national guard in the old days was widely regarded as 
something of a political organization 
it used to be solely a question of who you knew to climb to 
the top says one pentgon civilian 
thats changed a lot there are standards for a state adjutant 
general for example but the perception hasnt caught up

volunteer armies are forming to guard the home front patriots 
drilling without pay and often buying their own uniforms in the 
tradition of the minuteman militias of the american colonies 
pancho villa first signaled the need but thats history too 
todays militias train as auxiliaries to national guard units 
that are expected to be on the battlefield within days following 
the outbreak of war under the pentagons total force defense 
doctrine 
to fill the void left when the guardsmen are gone almost half 
the states over the last few years have organized state defense 
forces sometimes called the state guard state defense corps or 
state military reserve with about 10000 members all told and 
with widely varying strengths and capabilities 
its not unlike the home guard of world war i and the state 
guard of world war ii 
state defense forces are one of the bestkept military secrets 
in our nation says jerry fogel executive director of the state 
defense force association of the united states a 1000member 
organization based in kansas city mo that was formed four years 
ago as the state militia program was growing 
some of the state defense forces are little more than social 
clubs some are serious military organizations at least one was 
disbanded by state authorities because its leaders insisted on 
camouflage uniforms and rambostyle training including parachute 
jumps 
the uniforms of these citizensoldiers most of whom are retired 
from the military range from handmedown fatigues to dress blues 
purchased at their own expense tuxedos adorned with insignia and 
campaign ribbons have been recommended for social occasions 
the militiamens primary job is more that of policemen or rescue 
workers than soldiers in the absence of the national guard they 
would be called on to help out in emergencies such as hurricanes 
fires floods and civil disturbances assisting local police 
departments civil defense and disaster relief agencies but should 
the united states be threatened by invasion they would also be 
needed to guard strategic installations hydroelectric dams water 
treatment plants communications facilities 
each state defense force is controlled by the state governor and 
his adjutant general the states top military officer unlike the 
national guard which is 95 percent federally funded they get no 
money and little else except advice from washington that may 
change 
the national guard bureau the guards liaison with the 
pentagon has formed a committee to recommend some guidelines for 
organization of the state defense forces dealing with such things 
as training who can be a member what uniform they should wear and 
whether they should be armed 
in most states the militia is trained to function as a military 
police force focusing on such things as traffic and crowd control 
search and rescue and communications others undergo more vigorous 
combat training which the national guard bureau opposes the state 
defense force is not part of the national guard but both are under 
the control of the individual state adjutants general and often 
share the same armories 
george j stein a professor at miami university in oxford 
ohio and an authority on military reserves wrote in military 
review magazine that attempts to train the militias as potential 
combat forces are a waste of time 
while stein believes there is a need for militias in a 
constabulary role he says it is difficult to guess whether 
nostalgia or fantasy underlies the desire of some members to 
get out into the woods with a map and compass play combat infantry 
soldier and prepare to repel a parachute invasion from over the 
north pole 
but the states may do as they wish and any attempt by the 
federal bureacracy to interfere raises the hackles of some state 
officials 
that which they dont fund they sure as hell aint going to 
control says maj gen carl wallace adjutant general of 
tennessee the volunteer state 
but wallace strongly believes in the need for a state defense 
force 
we realized in late 1979 or 80 that tennessee would be in bad 
shape if all at once guard units were mobilized and taken out of 
the state he says wed have equipment and armories across the 
state that could not be protected 
the tennessee defense force has 840 volunteers including 15 
women and is organized in four brigades across the state members 
must be between the ages of 17 to 70 and include doctors lawyers 
preachers and even a country music singer grand ole opry regular 
charlie walker a world war ii veteran who is a lieutenant colonel 
the members wear regular army uniforms which they buy 
themselves with distinguishing name tags and brass they dont 
carry arms and there are no requirements for special training or 
meetings most units get together about once a month 
its a combination of a ceremonial and social club wallace 
says theyre not getting paid but theyre interested they like 
to put on a uniform 
the texas state guard on the other hand requires each 
guardsman to undergo at least 96 hours of training a year local 
commanders can and do require up to six times as much according 
to col tom williams the director of the guard 
with units in 123 communities including nine military police 
groups who are trained as mps for guard duty traffic and crowd 
control security and search and rescue the texas state guard has 
signed up only 1230 of the 3036 troops it is authorized 
its tough to get people to work for nothing williams says 
the militiamen do get paid when called to active duty by the 
governor such as the 34 called up when hurricane gilbert hit the 
coast in september 
the texas militiamen are armed with riotcontrol shotguns and 
night sticks and wear green fatigues there is a fulltime staff of 
three including williams 
the new york guard has a cadre of 615 volunteers but says it 
could mobilize up to 18000 if the national guard were called up 
they train with pistols shotguns and rifles and hold weekly drills 
at national guard armories one day a month on a weekend there is 
daylong classroom instruction a weeklong training program is held 
once a year but attendance is not mandatory 
with an annual budget of about 100000 the new york guard has 
two fulltime administrators a deputy chief of staff and his 
secretary members buy their own uniforms but get limited 
reimbursements for military expenses

one led to the indictment of former illinois gov otto kerner 
who was a us appellate court judge at the time of his conviction 
on bribery conspiracy and fraud charges in february 1983 
in another investigation more than 100 suburban officials 
mayors supervisors commissioners police officers were indicted 
on corruption charges 
what we learned in those years was that a lot of these 
activities were interrelated in other words that one person who 
was paying off one official in one town also was paying off other 
officials in other towns valukas says so we developed an 
intelligence base and leads for all these other investigations 
with each round of indictments and convictions federal 
prosecutors and agents grew more aggressive valukas says 
they began plotting elaborate stings using undercover agents 
wearing hidden tape recorders and microphones creating their own 
crooked companies to bribe public officials even staging phony 
crimes 
in late 1978 and early 1979 the feds began planning what would 
become one of the largest undercover investigations in the history 
of the fbi codenamed greylord a horses name picked from a 
racing sheet by an agent walsh said 
the greylord case was very difficult from a legal standpoint 
because we had to allow undercover agents to essentially commit 
state crimes and allow undercover agents to perjure themselves 
walsh says 
youre talking about allowing agents to get up in state court 
and swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth and 
then lie about their name and age and occupation 
in the probes undercover phase 198083 the agents found that 
areas of cook countys court system rivaled the fictional 
portrayals of justice on such popular television shows as hill 
street blues 
take the case of raymond sodini a judge since 1971 who pleaded 
guilty to accepting 6000 in bribes and was sentenced to eight 
years in prison in may 1987 
he presided over a smelly cramped courtroom on the 11th floor 
above police headquarters on the citys south side that became in 
the words of the federal judge who sentenced him a cesspool of 
corruption 
undercover agents found that five lawyers had formed what 
prosecutors called a hustlers bribery club they bribed sodini 
for permission to openly solicit business from criminal defendants 
stepping off the elevators an unethical practice known as 
hustling in the legal trade evidence showed 
the lawyers also paid off court clerks and sheriffs deputies to 
steer unrepresented clients to them the judge once had to mediate 
a dispute among the clerks and deputies over who was getting the 
most bribes testimony at his trial showed 
sodini pocketed more than 1000 a month in payoffs from 1980 to 
83 federal prosecutors contended at his trial 
there has been testimony that this sort of thing had been 
going on for decades valukas says and the reason it went on 
for decades is that no one ever talked about it the system 
condoned it 
one lawyer edward nydam kept meticulous records of his payoffs 
to judges and court personnel from 1979 to 83 and read them aloud 
in court during sodinis trial he listed the amounts next to 
initials like bm for bagman or mf for moonface the 
nickname of one judge 
patrick ryan a former sheriffs deputy and drinking buddy of 
sodinis testified that the judge twice called in to say hed been 
out late drinking the night before and wouldnt make the 8 am 
court call for winos and vagrants 
sodini instructed ryan to tell the court sergeant to put on the 
judges robes and handle the bum call later in the day sodini 
signed the orders entered by the court sergeant ryan testified 
while greylord uncovered outlandish behavior the phocus and 
lantern investigations into licensing zoning and purchasing fraud 
turned up classic chicagostyle public corruption valukas says 
he points to the case of consumers tire amp supply co 
fred taich who owned the company in 198286 routinely bribed 
10 city purchasing officers to win more than 2 million in 
contracts to sell tires tools and janitorial supplies to chicagos 
park district transit agency and five city departments evidence 
at his trial showed 
after paying the bribes taich often submitted inflated bills or 
phony invoices for equipment the city never bought to recover the 
cost of the payoffs valukas says 
but this being chicago he wouldnt just make up a 
nonexistent invoice he would include tax for say 25000 worth 
of nonexistent tires and then add in a profit thats tax and 
profit on the bribe valukas says 
taich pleaded guilty in may to mail fraud and tax evasion he 
was sentenced to two years in prison fined 100000 and ordered to 
repay 131000 to the city 
greylord has wrought significant reforms in the county courts 
i think the system is very very healthy today chief 
circuit judge harry comerford says i think what has happened is 
the bad seeds that had integrated themselves into the system have 
been removed 
the special commission appointed by comerford in the wake of 
greylord has recommended 195 reforms and many already have been 
adopted says lawyer jerold solovy the commissions chairman 
the chicago police department also has cleaned house since the 
early 1970s and its internal affairs department now works closely 
with federal agents and prosecutors 
the federal investigations indictments and convictions of city 
hall corruption prompted the city council in 1987 to enact the 
first ethics laws in chicagos history says simpson the political 
science professor several civic groups formed a coalition to fight 
corruption 
it cant be done simply by passing a law simpson says 
theres been a certain perverse pride among chicagoans in the 
scandals and as long as that didnt seem to affect the operations 
of government as long as the garbage was picked up it was 
viewed as sort of a form of entertainment simpson says 
valukas says were making inroads but i still think we have a 
long way to go although i never like to predict what the grand 
jury will do you can expect that between now and the end of the 
year corruption will be a topic of news coming out of the us 
attorneys office it is fertile ground unfortunately

it was an ancient art form among the indians of 
alaska a tradition that almost died out in the latter part of the 
20th century now the totem pole is coming back with a new 
generation of carvers taking up where their parents and 
grandparents left off 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
lee wallace is descended from a long line 
of totem pole carvers but his father like many other northwest 
coast indians gave up his craft for the sake of becoming 
modern 
today the younger wallace is part of a renaissance in the art of 
carving totem poles are coming back 
at 36 wallace is an apprentice carver at saxman a tlingit 
village just south of ketchikan where leaders are building totem 
poles into a local industry saxman has opened a totem park for 
tourists and hopes eventually to have a pole factory 
im from a long line of carvers my grandfather 
greatgrandfather greatgreatgrandfather were all carvers 
wallace says as his adz an axlike tool used for trimming and 
smoothing wood shapes a beaver on a pole in the saxman carving 
shed 
his grandfather was so renowned he was sent to other parts of 
the united states to carve poles for exhibitions wallace says but 
his grandfather died in 1950 and wallaces father gave up the craft 
it was a time when it was not popular to carve or to speak 
the language or to dance it still wasnt really popular around 
here in the 70s when i went to school he says 
wallace took up carving a few years ago when he lost his job as 
a flight attendant now he says theres nothing hed rather do than 
shape centuriesold cedar trees into works of art 
stories like wallaces can be heard throughout southeastern 
alaska where native arts galleries are opening amid souvenir shops 
and new poles are going up next to totems carved decades ago 
i would say five years ago you could look at the carvers and 
list them on one hand now there are carvers all over says bill 
trudeau former program director at the totem heritage center in 
ketchikan 
about 25 people indians and others are studying traditional 
carving at the center a cityrun museum established to preserve 
old totem poles 
at saxman high school students are offering carvings made in 
indian arts classes to a store that could hardly find items to sell 
two years ago 
in the last five years theres been national and international 
recognition of the art form says ward serrill president of cape 
fox tours the indian corporation that runs the totem park there 
has been a proliferation of books written consequently its a lot 
easier for someone to make a livelihood 
totem poles were just one of many types of art produced by 
northwest coast tribes they also carved copper shields wooden 
boxes large fishhooks and the interiors of their wooden plank 
houses 
when whites explored the region in the 1700s they found totem 
poles at indian villages along more than 1000 miles of coast from 
presentday washington state through british columbia to yakutat a 
village at the top of the alaska panhandle 
the restricting factors are the trees available and the 
tools trudeau says 
totem poles serve three purposes serrill says some mark a 
place others are mortuary or memorial poles the third type tells 
a story or commemorates an event 
the three most common colors are red from volcanic rock black 
from graphite or charcoal and a pale aqua made from copper ore 
the pigments were ground and mixed into paint with a natural 
adhesive made by chewing salmon eggs and cedar bark 
poles traditionally were owned by chiefs or other wealthy people 
who commissioned them carvers were traveling artisans who enjoyed 
high social status 
serrill dates the decline of pole carving to the late 1800s and 
the birth of a movement to suppress indian culture throughout the 
first half of the 20th century traditional indian activities were 
discouraged 
in 1938 the federal government included pole carving in the 
civilian conservation corps program decaying poles were brought to 
ketchikan from a number of outlying villages master carvers many 
in their 70s were hired to duplicate them and teach the art to 
younger people 
the group restored 48 old poles and duplicated 54 before world 
war ii broke out in 1941 then it disbanded to build airstrips and 
other military facilities says mary kowalczyk ranger for totem 
bight state park north of ketchikan 
carving all but stopped in the four decades that followed the 
art was kept alive at only a few centers including the university 
of washington in seattle the alaska indian arts center at haines 
and in the workshops of several canadian carvers 
today a handful of masters from those programs are teaching the 
current crop of novices there are about 30 carvers in southeastern 
alaska eight to 10 of them masters 
one of the teachers is wayne price who is working with wallace 
on the eaglebeaver pole at saxman price carves one side of the 
pole then wallace tries to match it strokeforstroke on the other 
side the 250yearold cedar theyre shaping lies horizontal on a 
platform in the saxman carving shed 
sitting on a partly carved paw and sharing his dried halibut 
between sentences the 31yearold price took a break to tell his 
story 
he started hanging around the indian arts center in haines in 
1970 when he was in junior high school he later apprenticed 
himself to an older carver and eventually began winning 
commissions since 1982 he has carved 17 poles 
totem pole carvers are paid 600 to 1000 per foot price says 
its not worth his while to work on anything under 8 feet 
carvers generally finish poles in four to six weeks

the first thing curtis runnels tells his 
archaeology students is that if they were stranded on a desert 
island they probably wouldnt last a day the students then proceed 
to fashion the primitive tools and weapons used by prehistoric man 
the premise is to show how modern technology is derived from 
ancient technology the connection between pretech and 
hightech 
</TEXT>

in a boston university science laboratory a 
student trims the top of a clay pot with a razorsharp chip of 
volcanic glass obtained by striking a rock with a deer antler at 
the other end of a long table another undergraduate struggles with 
a length of sinew to reinforce his beer can holder made of rafea a 
kind of vine 
another student is making a spearthrowing device called an 
atlatl which was used by prehistoric man to obtain dinner 
its all part of curtis runnels archaeology class 
prehistoric technology and culture where few concessions to 
modern man are permitted 
the general idea is to make todays hightech students 
understand that the evolution from flint knapping to computer 
processing wasnt as simple as it may seem 
were more or less learning how it started says david 
cowan a 19yearold psychology major from los angeles 
it takes a lot more thinking to understand the basic stuff 
than it takes to understand the modern technology he says 
runnels an assistant professor of archaeology developed the 
class four years ago when he was at stanford university students 
fashion arrowheads and clay pots start fires and speculate on how 
3 million years ago primitive man figured out how to kill a deer to 
get the antler to chip the volcanic glass to make the cutting tool 
on the first day of class runnels tells his charges something 
they probably already knew but never really dwelled on that they 
are slaves to technology 
if you were to be thrust down on some desert island 
somewhere he says with considerable exaggeration you guys 
would be dead in a day 
were so dependent on this division of labor and other people 
doing our technology for us that most of us cannot manipulate our 
technology he adds you can use a computer but you cant make 
one in fact you cant even make your dinnerware metal or 
plastic 
the courses basic premise is to show how modern technology is 
derived from ancient technology the connection between 
pretech and hightech 
runnels starts with stoneworking skills developed millions of 
years ago in africa metallurgy is studied next followed by 
pottery basketry and monumental architecture such as stonehenge 
and the pyramids 
theres a logic to this progression because what happens is 
as technology changes society changes runnels says theres a 
complex feedback relationship between these two things 
as an example runnels cites what he calls the prehistoric 
arms race some historians believe developed about 5000 years ago 
when someone discovered that weapons made of metal were more 
effective than ones of wood and stone 
all of a sudden there are new offensive and defensive weapons 
in the world runnels says sitting in an office decorated with a 
bronze sword a basket filled with spears and sticks and a tray 
holding fossilized acorns from 2800 bc greece 
now new fortification walls are necessary now youve got to 
have those weapons if those guys have got them runnels says a 
whole new ball game opens up because the specifics of the 
technology make it possible to control it 
runnels approaches technological advances such as metallurgy 
which was developed 8000 to 9000 years ago by comparing the 
techniques of prehistory with those of today 
he grabs a lump of multicolored rock sitting on the edge of his 
desk you know what that is one of the most fundamental building 
blocks of our whole electric civilization is copper and thats the 
source of copper runnels says 
all of our metallurgy including supersophisticated alloys 
have arisen out of essentially the same metallurgical techniques 
that were used in prehistory the iron beams that support this 
building that technique was invented in prehistory the glass in 
the windows and in the computer screen are right out of the glass 
technology 
all of this was done without any record people didnt come 
down from their mountain where they were recording the great deeds 
of political and military history to talk about what was going on 
down at the factories 
since runnels students arent aware of any of this he has them 
build a fire and make their own cutting tools so they can 
appreciate how ancient skills led to more sophisticated ones and 
also fell out of use 
it really gives you a sense that they were not idiots they 
were not nincompoops says joseph bloch 21 a senior from 
morristown nj majoring in ancient and medieval history he made 
an arrowhead he is quite proud of 
it really looks like something youd dig up he says its 
amazing that you can make something that was made millions of years 
ago 
most of the dozen or so students who take runnels class each 
semester major in fields outside archaeology but were attracted by 
the handson nature and the professors animated style 
the classs firstaid kit is used often when students nick 
their fingers with antlers and obsidian the deep marooncolored 
volcanic glass that is used to cut everything from clay to twine 
one of the few hightech materials used is a kiln to fire clay 
pots to up to 1200 degrees fahrenheit runnels says a natural 
blaze would do just as well but for some reason they wont let 
us build a fire in the parking lot 
when he taught the class in slightly more bucolic palo alto 
calif runnels did in fact have the class build a fire in the 
woods they roasted wienies and marshmallows just like in 
prehistory 
making fire is a lot harder to do than youd think says 
lara prihodko 20 a sophomore archaeology major with a newfound 
appreciation for matches it took like five people to do it

to get to the offices of the van dyke 
show at culver studios you have to go to the rear of the building 
and climb two flights of iron stairs 
maybe if the show does well well get new offices without 
stairs says dick van dyke 
in a new halfhour comedy on cbs van dyke and his son barry 
play a father and son who team up to run a struggling regional 
theater in a rural town in pennsylvania barry gives up a career in 
advertising to pursue his dream of running the theater dick is a 
famous stage and screen star who stops off to see his son and is 
dragooned into an effort to salvage the risky venture 
the van dyke show has its own hard climb ahead 
the show is paired with mary tyler moores new sitcom on cbs on 
wednesday nights both shows premiere oct 26 although miss 
moores show is as yet untitled its a comeback effort for both of 
them once among the most beloved entertainers on television its 
been a long time since either has had a hit show 
the dick van dyke show in the 1960s which also starred miss 
moore is a classic that makes just about everyones list of 
favorite shows his next situation comedy was only moderately 
successful and his attempt at a variety show van dyke and 
company was a quick failure his last regular appearance was on 
the carol burnett show in 1977 he hasnt had his own show in 
12 years 
theres no talk that i know of to have mary and i visit each 
others shows van dyke says but if i dont deliver her some 
ratings she may drop in on me 
barry van dyke has been in four series the harvey korman 
show battlestar galactica gun shy and the redd foxx 
show but none was a success 
the mary tyler moore show in the 1970s was another gem but 
two attempts at a variety show didnt work nor did miss moores 
next comedy series in 198586 
both van dyke and miss moore face formidable competition on 
wednesday nights from abcs growing pains and head of the 
class and nbcs unsolved mysteries 
the van dyke show also stars kari lizer as barrys wife 
barry osullivan as their son whitman mayo as the stage manager 
and maura tierny as the woman who runs the ticket office 
the show has also run into creative problems 
we discarded the pilot because it wasnt right says the 
senior van dyke weve made some changes in the concept and in 
the cast i think in the pilot we tried to get in so much 
background exposition that we forgot to be entertaining our 
relationship is no longer so adversarial 
barry says we had too much conflict and not enough comedy it 
was real but it wasnt funny weve gotten rid of all the 
background where he had been an absentee father and i was 
resentful we deal more with the present and the future how a play 
will be done whether im going to let him help me out 
financially 
well probably get into generational differences such as how 
to raise a child adds dick 
all three of van dykes comedies have centered on shows within 
the show in the first he was a writer on the alan brady show 
with carl reiner playing brady in the second show he was the host 
of a local television talk show and in the present show the focus 
is the theater 
the elder van dyke is welltanned and his jaw juts out like a 
snowplow beneath thick white hair he wears a blue pullover sweater 
with rimless glasses hanging from his neck white sailing pants and 
sneakers without socks barry looks like a younger version but is 
more conservatively dressed in darker clothes 
this is their first real collaboration although barry made his 
television debut on dicks morning show on cbs in 1955 id 
come out and say daddy he recalls 
his acting debut was on the dick van dyke show at the age of 
9 in 1962 he later worked as an associate producer on the new 
dick van dyke show and made occasional appearances in small parts 
alan brady had a talent show and i came in and played a 
violin barry says of his debut performance i was actually 
taking violin lessons at the time but that got me hooked on 
acting to a 9yearold it looked like a great way to make a 
living dad held me back until i was older 
dick says he may use some of his own stage appearances for the 
series he won a tony as best supporting actor for bye bye 
birdie his last appearance on broadway came when he took the 
music man on the road and finished the tour at the city center in 
new york

in this city that boasts an extraordinary 
symphony orchestra and a firstrate art museum josephine abady 
hopes to provide something it never has had before a worldclass 
theater 
her formidable task is to wake up the slumbering cleveland play 
house a regional theater long on history and short on artistic 
excitement for more than 70 years the theater has been part of 
clevelands cultural life alive but rarely making waves or 
attracting attention 
that changed after abady arrived in january as the theaters 
artistic director and began planning 13 productions on three stages 
for her 198889 season one of the first things she did was fire 
the companys resident acting troupe including some members who 
had been employed for 25 years or more there were protests from 
some longtime subscribers unhappy play house board members and 
angry letters to the cleveland plain dealer 
im not the most popular girl in cleveland abady says now 
it was a very very difficult decision to make but this theater 
had become very insular it had used the same actors over and over 
so the quality and level of performance and production here had 
become very small 
abady will now cast each show separately bringing in what she 
says will be the best actors and directors she can find and she 
has a budget of 48 million up 1 million from the previous 
season to bring her plans to fruition 
she also brought in her own production staff including a 
literary manager and a company director to strengthen the artistic 
side of the operation and she began putting together a season she 
hoped would attract audiences and stop the downward spiral of 
subscribers they now number about 12000 about half of the 
capacity of the play houses three theaters 
what she devised was a fascinating mixture of the old and the 
new 
her first production although not part of the first seasons 
subscription series was born yesterday by garson kanin and 
starring ed asner and madeline kahn they were two big names who 
might lure back audiences who stopped going to the play house 
abady directed the revival herself and after the september opening 
in cleveland the play is on a long national tour before arriving 
on broadway next january when it does the play house will gain 
further visibility as one of its producers 
currently on her agenda is on the waterfront the world 
premiere of the stage version of budd schulbergs novel of the same 
name adapted by schulberg and stan silverman grant show of 
televisions ryans hope plays terry malloy the role made 
famous by marlon brando in the film and abady will direct again 
it will run through nov 20 
i wanted to start off the subscription season here with 
something that is new and dynamic but also familiar enough that 
people who hadnt been coming to the play house might be 
attracted abady says something that was related to this 
community without being a local play and then i remembered that 
cleveland is redeveloping its waterfront 
for the rest of the season that ends next may she has several 
new plays including italianamerican reconciliation by john 
patrick shanley who won an oscar for his moonstruck 
screenplay and real dreams a play set in cleveland but 
written by an englishman more traditional offerings include the 
musical carnival directed by jack hofsiss the london and 
broadway hit les liaisons dangereuses and an allblack cast in 
the glass menagerie starring ruby dee 
most of the stuff is new because i think if a theater is going 
to make its mark on the community and ultimately the theatrical 
world at large you have to generate work as well as reproduce 
work abady says born yesterday is a loving revival but you 
also have to do things like waterfront and italianamerican 
reconciliation and real dreams

its that community awareness and national profile that the 
cleveland play house wants 
the company certainly has the facilities its threetheater 
complex looks like a redbrick medieval village rising out of the 
ruins of the citys rundown east side an area still recovering 
from the riots of the late 1960s 
behind the three theaters stands an old sears roebuck 
department store purchased by the play house in 1980 the building 
now renovated holds production facilities some 200000 square 
feet of space where sets costumes and props can be stored and 
where rehearsals are held what was once the ladies lingerie 
department is now a private club and restaurant for theater 
subscribers 
two of its theaters were built side by side in 1927 and a 
third larger theater designed by philip johnson was opened in 
1983 johnson linked all three theaters together with a huge 
rotunda and added connecting passageways 
this theater has always been a family affair when they built 
this building it stopped being a family affair abady says 
referring to the johnson project it costs 1 million a year to 
run it before there is the first bit of art on stage like a lot of 
institutions they had the edifice complex for a while 
despite its long history the play house has had only a half 
dozen or so artistic directors the theater was founded in 1915 but 
didnt really start developing until 1921 when frederic mcconnell 
and k elmo lowe came from pittsburgh to run it by the time lowe 
retired in 1969 their reign had lasted nearly 50 years the 
company had become a family it also had its share of famous 
graduates performers such as joel grey paul newman margaret 
hamilton alan alda and dom deluise played the theater 
in the 1970s the theater was directed by richard oberlin who 
had been trained by mcconnell and lowe by the end of the decade 
critics were starting to grumble about the quality of the 
productions some called the play house dull one step up from 
community theater 
the malaise continued into the 80s and when oberlin resigned 
in 1985 william rhys was named acting director rhys took over the 
theater while the board began its search for a permanent artistic 
director who would be a strong leader they found her in the 
berkshires 
the 39yearold abady has made a lot of difficult decisions in 
her career for nine years she ran the berkshire theater festival 
in stockbridge mass she eliminated the festivals deficit set up 
an endowment fund reconditioned the theater and made it a center 
for american drama the festival even started to develop a national 
profile coming out from under the shadow of the williamstown 
theater festival a starstudded summer troupe that also operates 
in the berkshires 
i probably could have done that job for the rest of my life 
abady says but i felt i wanted a new challenge and i was afraid 
of getting stale 
abady will be a visible artistic director in cleveland 
brochures for the new season proclaim josephine abady is coming 
to town her name is stamped on the product whether it succeeds 
or not 
my theory of management has always been the same although 
managers probably will have a fit she says you hire really 
good people to do their jobs tell them what the parameters are and 
then you leave them alone ive always had good people working for 
me 
if you make the environment for actors directors and staff a 
really productive one where people feel they have a stake in the 
outcome its easy to get good people abady says the beauty 
and thrill of the theater is that its a collaborative process if 
it happens correctly thats what i want to institute here

grave robbers came within 3 feet of making 
off with the contents of the most valuable ancient tomb ever found 
in the western hemisphere before peruvian archaeologists with the 
help of police beat them to it 
thus was saved the tomb of the great lord of sipan which one 
american specialist says ranks with king tuts tomb in egypt as one 
of the worlds most important looks back to ancient times 
the sipan discovery was announced sept 13 by the national 
geographical society in washington dc but details of how close 
the grave robbers had come and how they worked were made known 
recently here at the site 
they were close to reaching him said walter alva director 
of perus bruning archaeological musuem which conducted the 
excavation if they had they would have destroyed his tomb and 
we would not now have a discovery of incalculable value that will 
allow us to know better the ancient peruvians 
the archaeologists were tipped off to the grave robbers by other 
robbers angry because they were not included in the plan 
the robbers who worked around the clock with a system of 
sentries succeeded in making off with peripheral treasures but 
the tomb itself was found intact by the archaeologists who were 
able to perserve its contents and clues to a warring people who 
preceded the incas and made a desert bloom 
but it took a police raid and gunplay near the site to finally 
secure the area for the archaelogists to move in 
the great lord of sipan a name given him by archaeologists 
ruled over a vast desert kingdom in what now is northern peru he 
died in his mid30s and lay unmolested for 1500 years before the 
grave robbers started their encroachment 
his burial chamber contained finely crafted gold jewelry worth 
half a million dollars and more than 1200 ceramic vessels with 
painted scenes of daily life of the moche people one of the 
earliest civilizations of the americas 
the tomb found on the upper platform of a pyramid near the 
coastal village of sipan 500 miles northwest of lima has 
astonished archaeologists for its wealth and the information it 
contains about a little known culture 
the find also has focused a spotlight on the shadowy world of 
international artifact smuggling and its impact on peru an 
impoverished nation without the resources to protect and 
investigate hundreds of precolumbian temples 
this is the richest tomb ever excavated archaeologically in 
the western hemisphere the quality of the gold work is stunning 
dr christopher donnan an expert on ancient peru told a news 
conference in washington when the discovery was announced at the 
headquarters of the national geographic society which financed the 
excavation 
the importance of the tombs contents to archaeology ranks with 
the discovery in 1922 of king tutankhamens burial place in egypt 
donnan said he is the director of the museum of cultural history 
at the university of california at los angeles 
the cache contained among other items a gold face mask a 
2footwide solid gold crown a gold knife two strands of large 
gold and silver beads shaped like peanuts and a gold warriors 
shield weighing almost 2 pounds 
the lord of sipan was a warriorpriest with administrative 
powers he was about 35 at death and was 5 feet tall 
buried with him were a dog apparently a favorite pet a child 
three young women possibly wives or concubines and three men 
including one believed to be a sentry whose feet had been cut off 
to prevent him from abandoning his duty of guarding the tomb in the 
next life 
imagine the power he had all those people were sacrificed and 
entombed with him said luis chero resident archaeologist at the 
site he was a great lord with absolute control over the lives of 
his subjects 
the tomb was at one end of a ceremonial adobebrick platform 
230 feet long 166 feet wide and 33 feet high 
the 150foothigh pyramid called huaca rajada by local 
villagers juts up out of miles of surrounding sugar cane fields 
some of them still watered by canals built by the moche according 
to juan martinez an archaeologist on the excavation

archaeologists say the moche people were a warring nation given 
to human sacrifice highly skilled in metallurgy and proficient in 
using complex irrigation systems to make desert lands produce 
bountiful harvests of cotton and corn 
the moche dominated a 300mile stretch of perus northern coast 
from about 100 to 800 ad their civilization mysteriously 
disappeared long before the spaniards arrived in the 1530s and 
destroyed the better known inca empire which held sway hundreds of 
years after the moche 
the huaca rajada pyramid apparently was a giant mausoleum for a 
succession of moche rulers and archaeologists have recently 
discovered a second tomb now under excavation of another 
warriorpriest although of lesser rank than the lord of sipan 
it is as if we were making the moche live again 
archaeologist chero said of the discoveries 
the moche did not have a written language but chero whose 
copper skin and high cheekbones are mirrored in the faces on 
sipans golden masks said the carefully placed layers of ceramic 
vessels with descriptive scenes found in the first tomb were like 
the pages of a book 
valuable information about the relationship of one object to 
another in a tomb is irretrievably lost when it is plundered by 
grave robbers known here as huaqueros a word meaning looters 
that is a spinoff of the quechua word huaca for holy place 
pottery is not placed haphazardly in tombs chero explained 
it always is meant to communicate something what the huaqueros 
do is terrible they destroy everything and take the pieces out of 
their context 
huaca rajada is honeycombed with tunnels and pockmarked with 
looters pits a vertical tunnel that alva said was dug by 
huaqueros stops about 3 feet short of the burial chamber 
fifteen feet away near the top of the platform is another tunnel 
20 feet straight down 
it was there that huaqueros from the village of sipan struck pay 
dirt in february 1987 working day and night with guards posted to 
warn of the arrival of strangers several dozen looters extracted 
what is believed to have been a treasure trove perhaps as great as 
that found by the archaeologists months later 
soon afterwards authorities noticed an influx of unusually fine 
gold and silver artifacts on the clandestine antiquities market 
some artifacts confiscated at the los angeles airport in april may 
include items stolen from sipan alva has traveled to los angeles 
to study the pieces 
without a tip from jealous huaqueros it would have been very 
difficult for the government to learn exactly where the gold was 
coming from said martinez 
in a police raid in april 1987 at the home of one of the 
families looting the pyramid a ringleader was shot and killed and 
some of the gold artifacts were rescued 
when alva and his assistants arrived at sipan to excavate the 
pyramid the villagers accused them of trying to take what was 
rightfully theirs and threatened them the site is now protected by 
armed police and enclosed by a 10foothigh barbed wire fence 
many people in sipan say their families have dug through the 
temples around here for generations martinez said 
taking artifacts from ancient temples is prohibited but peru 
lacks the funds to enforce the laws or to finance archaeological 
excavations 
there is no economic support in peru by the government to 
conduct archaeological work on a large scale said martinez 
the government is interested in projects that give quick 
returns 
chero said hundreds of temples on perus northern coast have 
never been excavated by archaeologists because of lack of money 
near sipan alone there are 15 pyramids we have a good idea 
of where there may be tombs he said but without money we 
cant excavate

cynics have long joked that britain joined the 
european economic community not to advance unity in europe but to 
make sure it never came about 
after prime minister margaret thatchers latest blunt dismissal 
of the ideal of a united states of europe some are saying the 
cynics were right 
but for all those denouncing the conservative mrs thatcher as 
insular and narrowminded others are welcoming her approach as a 
muchneeded cold shower on what they view as a fantasy 
the longstanding question of how committed britain is to europe 
boiled up anew sept 20 when mrs thatcher delivering a major 
policy speech in the ancient belgian town of bruges expressed 
fears that the european economic community also known as the 
common market might become a european superstate imposing its 
will on the 12 member states 
to try to suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the 
center of a european conglomerate would be highly damaging she 
said 
europe will be stronger precisely because it has france as 
france spain as spain britain as britain each with its own 
customs traditions and identity it would be folly to try to fit 
them into some sort of identikit european personality 
an identikit is a set of drawings of various types of eyes 
noses mouths and other facial features that police artists use to 
put together a composite sketch of a suspect 
in references that make europeanenthusiasts in britain wince 
mrs thatcher recalled britains defeat of germany in two world 
wars 
had it not been for that willingness to fight and die europe 
would have been united long before now but not in liberty and 
justice 
next day in luxembourg undaunted by angry continental press 
comment she said a centralized european government would be a 
nightmare 
elephant in the china shop of europe declared italys la 
stampa while the dutch newspaper de volskrant said mrs thatcher 
wrought more damage than hurricane gilbert 
mrs thatchers fellow leaders were more restrained 
prime minister andreas papandreou of greece current president 
of the eec called on mrs thatcher to explain the exact meaning 
of her vision 
foreign minister leo tindemans of belgium said i am 
disappointed but i do not despair she is intelligent and i think 
we have good arguments to convince her yet 
for some it was not so much the words as what frances le monde 
newspaper called her raw and provocative style which 
regenerated charges that mrs thatcher americas no 1 european 
ally has a moneygrabbing antiforeigner attitude toward the eec 
central to the debate is 1992 when the communitys current 
trade barriers are to fall turning belgium britain denmark 
france west germany greece ireland italy luxembourg the 
netherlands portugal and spain into one huge market of 322 million 
people 
the immediate focus of mrs thatchers misgivings is the 
prospect of losing taxraising prerogatives and a remark by 
jacques delors the french socialist who heads the eecs european 
commission that after 1992 80 percent of economic and social 
legislation would be handled from the eec headquarters in brussels 
belgium 
european leaders dont realistically envisage a united states of 
europe in their lifetime but mrs thatcher argues that the 
cumulative effect of regulations emanating from brussels may be to 
create an additional tier of government encroaching on national 
sovereignties 
for instance the european commission is pressing for sales 
taxes to be harmonized throughout the eec arguing that it is 
essential for the single market for britain this would mean 
imposing sales taxes on food and childrens clothes which mrs 
thatcher has pledged not to do it would also mean cutting taxes in 
britain on liquor and cigarettes a major source of government 
revenue 
mrs thatchers suspicions on the monetary front were 
illustrated recently when she bluntly slapped down an idea mooted 
by european leaders to set up a european central bank she also 
refuses to join the currencystabilizing mechanism of the european 
monetary system 
at present the european commissions powers are restricted to 
recommending and implementing regulations while the 518member 
european parliament which includes 81 british members is mainly a 
talking shop 
real power lies in the european councils which consist of the 
heads of government or say the finance or foreign ministers from 
each country mrs thatcher has had to compromise on key issues 
like farm subsidies but she would strongly resist yielding the 
power of veto that each country now has on issues that affect 
vital national interests or fiscal matters 
meanwhile british europolitics have been transformed it was a 
conservative government that took britain into the eec in 1973 
despite opposition from the socialist labor party and the trade 
unions that finance it 
at the time the unions feared the eec as the flagship of 
multinational companies and unrestricted imports and until 1983 the 
labor party was pledged to pull britain out 
now the unions see europewide social legislation from brussels 
as their best hope of winning back the power mrs thatchers 
conservative government has taken from them 
delors got a heros welcome at the british trade union congress 
annual conference in september 
1992 is much more than the creation of an internal market 
delors told the congress it is necessary to improve workers 
living and working conditions 
the unions were delighted 
the only card game in town at the moment is a town called 
brussels enthused the transport workers leader ron todd now 
is the time for us to learn some new rules some new languages 
the labor partys foreign affairs spokesman george foulkes 
said mrs thatcher had suddenly seen the future a social europe 
looking after the interests of ordinary people frightened her 
because she realized it would undermine the harshness of 
thatcherism 
simon jenkins a columnist for the london sunday times jibed 
that delors offered the unions a rosestrewn path back to their 
former power a paradise of europewide restrictive practices 
beyond the reach of any thatcher reformation 
british masscirculation newspapers always chary of the eec 
did not share the labor leaders enthusiasm 
she is saying exactly what the people think commented the 
4million circulation sun they have no desire whatsoever to 
become politically involved with foreigners with whom they have 
nothing in common european union is a dead duck 
some argue that mrs thatcher says openly what other leaders 
wont admit publicly that the eec is primarily a trading bloc not 
a united political force 
it is almost a tradition in many of the european countries to 
pay lipservice to certain ideals and to have an understanding that 
practice is a very different matter commented john coleman 
editor of the londonbased new european 
as for the public at large callers to a recent radio talk show 
were evenly divided between supporters and critics of mrs 
thatchers speech at bruges a national poll done for the mail on 
sunday a prothatcher weekly indicated that a narrow 4743 
majority believe britains role lay in increasing ties with europe 
rather than the united states

sociologists have called comedy nightclubs an american 
subculture sub no more standup comedy has spread to what used to 
be called the sticks 
if any proof was needed that comedy clubs have arrived it can 
be found in columbia pictures punchline it is a totally 
entertaining view of the entertainment phenomenon the only wonder 
is why hollywood took so long to get around to it 
tom hanks is a medical student who is failing his studies 
because he spends his nights in a manhattan club the gas station 
trying to make people laugh sally field is a new jersey housewife 
and mother of three who plays hooky from home for the same reason 
the gas station is peopled by zealots driven to make that big 
score on the carson or letterman shows most of them havent a 
ghost of a chance and some are pitiable they join in a kind of 
competitive camaraderie like members of a college fraternity the 
house mother is club owner mark rydell who can be alternately 
merciless and compassionate 
field is exquisitely unfunny onstage with her dumb polish jokes 
and you wonder why she persists hanks on the other hand shows 
promise at least he has the ruthlessness that comedy is reputed to 
demand eventually he takes pity on the hapless housewife and 
coaches her into an acceptable act 
suddenly the gas station is thrust into the big time with a 
network television competition staged in the club the comics 
compete fiercely but only one can be the winner 
david seltzer wrote and directed punchline and he has 
captured all the grit and grind the heartbreak and the triumph of 
standup comedy sometimes he oversimplifies the climactic 
telecast lacks logic would any network allow uncensored comedy 
also the incipient romance of hanks and field is resolved and 
anticlimactic 
the performances are triumphant bust out all the adjectives for 
tom hanks following his big splash he is unquestionably the 
frontrunner in the 1988 academy award race sally field displays 
an unexpected comedy flair as well as the earnestness for which 
she is noted equally effective is rydell better known as a 
director on golden pond 
punchline was produced by daniel melnick and michael 
rachmil the rating is r because of the explicit language running 
time a breezy 128 minutes

2995 rated r 
 
joan is on her way to malibu with her hippielike friend mike 
they stop in the desert near tucson ariz where she meets and 
falls in love with paul 
bad move joanie the desert seems to have its way with women 
and in white of the eye women drop like so many grains of 
sand hacked to death by a deranged killer who stores their body 
parts in plastic bags 
joans biggest problem besides her selfindulgence is that the 
killer is husband paul who appears to be a normal father and a 
passionate lover but he occasionally has the need to paint his 
face don a samurai hairdo lay out indian objects in some sort of 
bizarre ritual and kill a woman 
david keith plays paul with a quiet rage though police suspect 
him from the start we are led to believe his innocence but the 
script never quite explains what has led the successful audio 
technician to be a homicidal maniac 
cathy moriarty gives her sexy all to joan and does her best 
working with the silly and sometimes farfetched dialogue and 
situations written by china and donald cammell who also directed 
when joan finds her husbands stash of spare body parts she 
calmly calls up a girlfriend and asks her to take care of their 
daughter for the night the reason marital problems be real 
despite a weak script and lapses of reality white of the 
eye offers glorious camera work by larry mcconkey and nice 
performances by keith and moriarty 
the r rating is well deserved for violence there also is sexual

the last emperor nelson entertainment vhsbeta 8998 
rated pg13 
 
probably no recent film better exemplifies what a blessing home 
video is than the last emperor this epic which won nine 
academy awards including best picture must surely rank with the 
best films ever made and yet hasnt enjoyed the boxoffice success 
it richly deserves 
now with video you can catch what many of you so foolishly 
missed 
director bernardo bertolucci makes brilliant and seamless use of 
flashbacks to tell the saga of pu yi who became emperor of china in 
1908 the last before that nation was sundered by 20thcentury wars 
and social forces 
pu yi is a fascinating paradoxical historical figure because 
as the movie shows so movingly this man born to seemingly 
unlimited power is nothing more than a prisoner in a gilded cage a 
museum piece who takes a painful lifetime to realize how time has 
passed him and his royal kind by he is a pawn who thinks himself a 
king 
his whole life is spent as a captive first of the forbidden 
city in beijing later of the japanese when they set him up as 
puppet ruler in their captive state of manchukuo in the 1930s 
finally he spends a decade in a prison getting reeducated by 
the chinese communists who revile him as a japanese collaborator 
bertoluccis feat is in no small measure thanks to the chinese 
who allowed him to film on location at the forbidden city it makes 
for an eyeful 
the last emperor runs 2 hours and 44 minutes but is never 
less than gripping the film is rated pg13 with a few very brief 
snatches of nudity and a word or two of profanity

at the end of spike lees latest and eagerly awaited film the 
hero storms the campus of a black college yelling wake up 
unfortunately that call may be needed by many who sit all the way 
through an occasionally bright film which seems to have lost its 
way 
not quite a drama never exactly a comedy school daze even 
takes a stab at being a musical nothing works well enough to meet 
the expectations created by lees first big success shes gotta 
have it 
the movie explores conflict between lightskinned wannabees 
want to be whites and the earthier jigaboos at mission 
college the hero dap larry fishburne is leading protests 
against the schools investments in south africa and generally 
trying to raise the social consciousness of his fellow students 
however his cousin half pint spike lee aspires to join the 
leading fraternity presided over by the smug sadistic julian 
giancarlo esposito 
half pint becomes a frat man in effect by bedding julians 
girlfriend at julians insistence unlike mars blackmon the 
talkative streetsmart character lee played in shes gotta have 
it half pint is simply a worm not many laughs there 
among the bright moments in the film is ossie davis cameo as an 
overwrought football coach begging his team to end a losing string 
lee follows with an impressive game scene which never once looks at 
the field but charts the defeat in the sagging spirit of the crowd

western standard time epic asleep at the wheel 
 
with asleep at the wheel its always western standard time 
time for american standards western swing style 
this time out singerguitaristfrontman ray benson and his six 
cohorts swing their way through 10 more songs they like to play 
from glenn miller chattanooga choo choo to commander cody and 
his lost planet airmen hot rod lincoln 
for the most part these are reverential renditions of 
certifiably great american music 
san antonio rose the signature song of the king of western 
swing bob wills is served up almost too neatly with benson 
resonant but overly controlled in the footsteps of tommy duncan 
wills longtime lead singer 
another standard walking the floor over you works better 
going for the spirit of that great country classic down to a 
pretty good job of sounding like ernest tubb which cant be an 
easy thing to do 
chattanooga choo choo finds benson and willie nelson 
swapping vocals over a heavy horn arrangement making a song thats 
become a cliche interesting again nelson shows he could have been 
a fine orchestra crooner a country crosby if you will 
weakest are two side 2 throwaways an overly serious roly 
poly a silly ode to obesity and the instrumental sugarfoot 
rag for aficionados only 
western swing seems to be making sort of a comeback these days 
george straits ace in the hole band is a prime example and that 
must bring some feeling of vindication to asleep at the wheel a 
proudly anachronistic band pledged for 18 years now to the 
perpetuation of an underappreciated art form 
despite this albums limitations when it was over i found 
myself reaching for an old bob wills record and that i would 
think is the idea

instinct aampm iggy pop 
 
this album is a shocker who wouldve thought that iggy pop 
would still be alive to make a record in his 40s 
instinct cant be compared with the groundbreaking music a 
young and crazed iggy made as leader of stooges more than 15 years 
ago but theres still a link evident between the godfather of punk 
and such acts as the sex pistols ramones and billy idol all 
metal minimalists with a theatrical shtick 
on instinct the metal tramples the theatrics expistol 
steve jones cranks out one thundering rhythm guitar riff after 
another while pop alternately snarls and croons like a cross 
between james dean and dean martin 
the lyrics are dumb but matched with such simple arrangements 
thats ok pop is heartbroken on lowdown mad at the system on 
power amp freedom and on the run on the title cut but most of 
all hes defiant i aint gonna be no squarehead pop sings on 
squarehead then he barks 
its fortunate for his fans that iggy still doesnt act his age

orlando gibbons second service and anthems crd choir of new 
college oxford edward higginbottom conducting 
thomas weelkes ninth service and anthems nimbus choir of 
christ church cathedral oxford stephen darlington conducting 
 
gibbons and weelkes were late figures in englands musical 
renaissance the last great composers of an era dominated by thomas 
tallis and william byrd 
gibbons born in 1583 was appointed organist of the chapel 
royal at age 21 and was named organist of westminster abbey two 
years before his death in 1625 
weelkes born around 1570 was appointed organist at chichester 
cathedral in 1601 and died in london in 1623 weelkes seems to have 
been a bad egg frequently at chichester for drunkenness and foul 
language 
both men are well known for their madrigals including weelkes 
o care thou will despatch me and gibbons the silver swan 
the highlights of the gibbons recording come at the end 
especially a spirited rendition of o clap your hands 
higginbottoms reading of the verse anthem see see the word is 
incarnate is more languid but equally assured 
higginbottom chose to perform with organ accompaniment instead 
of with a consort of viols a choice which some listeners will 
regret the disc also excludes one of gibbons greatest verse 
anthems this is the record of john 
those reservations aside this is the most satisfying collection 
of gibbons sacred music now available livelier than the 
recording by the kings college choir made in 1982 and technically 
far superior to that by the clerkes of oxenford in the mid1970s 
both of those earlier recordings have recently been released on cd 
weelkes exile in chichester adds a touch of poignancy to some 
of his greater compositions which seem to have been intended for 
the chapel royal in london rather than his provincial cathedral 
choir 
the disc from the choir of christ church cathedral in oxford 
leaves no doubt about weelkes talent alleluia i heard a 
voice is a brilliantly effective song of praise despite its minor 
key hosanna to the son of david has become a palm sunday 
favorite in many churches and there are few songs of the period as 
touching as weelkes setting of when david heard that absalom was 
slain 
the christ church choir gives a solid performance if 
occasionally marred by some raggedy trebles on the highest notes

in at a new york comedy emporium she bombs but under the tutelage 
of another tyro comic played by tom hanks she manages to hold her 
audience with her oneliners about domestic distress 
its hard to imagine the fundamentally shy field trying to 
squeeze laughs out of a jaded nightclub audience she admits that 
unlike her costar she didnt practice her role 
i did no research for the character because i understand her 
very well being a housewife with three children and wanting to 
have her life and her career i understand all that she said in 
an interview at her rambling brentwood house 
the difficult part was doing the standup i wish i could say i 
did months and months of preparation i tried to do months and 
months of preparation but i couldnt find the comedy we wrote our 
own comedy tom hanks with his comedy team i wrote with my comedy 
team 
the day he got the part hanks started appearing in comedy clubs 
in los angeles and new york field said finding the comedy 
writing the comedy getting onstage making it work honing and 
twisting and pinching and pulling 
i went onstage once with no material whatsoever because lily 
tomlin told me to she said i just talked to people they had 
to go home and say lets never do that again dear you told me 
to go to a comedy club it was so dull 
i worked and worked and worked for about six months to find 
where lilahs comedy was which is what my character was going 
through so it was actually happening to both of us 
being bad in the early stages was not hard that came easy to 
me the academy awardwinning actress said 
her early training in such tv comedies as gidget and the 
flying nun provided little help 
i have a sense of humor a sense of comedy for sally she 
said i dont think its terribly sophisticated i dont think 
its terribly unique i can hear my certain timing but its very 
different to do a comedic scene in a film or even have a funny 
evening in the living room with your friends than it is to stand up 
on a stage with 200 or 300 people you dont know and be funny 
punchline which was coproduced by fields fogwood 
productions is the first major film depicting the outburst of 
comedy clubs across the country the reason for the phenomenon 
people may have studied the psychological reasons but my 
feeling is the country needs to laugh the world needs to laugh 
the actressproducer said people need to forget themselves for a 
while because it is a troubled time 
i also think that it is almost flirting with danger when you 
watch standup comedy youre almost stopping to watch an accident 
happen youre afraid that the person on stage will fail thats 
half the excitement they are there throwing themselves off a cliff 
they need one thing and one thing only laughter if they 
dont get that they fail she said its very dangerous very 
exciting it is almost like throwing the christians in with the 
lions the audience paid their money theyve earned the right 
to be entertained if theyre not they make it known 
field at 41 is amazed to reflect that she is approaching her 
25th year as an actress dont they give people gold watches and 
put them out to pasture when they reach that point 
she was born into the business her mother was a starlet her 
stepfather was jock mahoney a sometime tarzan and tvs range rider 
right out of high school she enrolled in columbia studios 
acting workshop and soon was playing leads in series she finally 
escaped her flying nun reputation in the 1976 stay hungry a 
year later she won an emmy for portraying a woman afflicted with 
multiple personalities in the tv movie sybil field was no 
longer considered a lightweight 
academy voters liked her enough to bestow the oscar for norma 
rae in 1979 and places in the heart in 1985 
did she miss anything by going to work so early 
yeah im sure i have she said i gained a lot of 
knowledge and information but there was a part of the tail end of 
my childhood that i didnt have it would have been nice to go to 
college and be part of that kind of community when youre still 
allowed to be young 
i hope my children choose that i have one in college now and 
thats why im feeling it its very important learning growing 
time 
the actress has two sons from an early marriage peter 18 and 
eli 15 last january she and her second husband producer alan 
greisman became parents of another boy sam 
field believes that she has been able to combine her family and 
professonal lives but she also said shes tired 
id like to lie down for six or seven months she said 
im tired but like a comedian who gets the laughs it seems to 
be worth it to me i come home and theres my family and they all 
say hi to me usually i have the baby on my hip im tired

to understand the paintings of vicky montesinos 
is to know her dreams 
we all have our own universe said montesinos a mexican 
artist whose work has been shown throughout the world it belongs 
to you only sometimes you allow others to be in your universe and 
sometimes you dont 
the 44yearold montesinos is on show this fall at the circle 
gallery in soho 
i feel like my own universe is full of dreams a fantasy 
nothing that is quite visible she says 
that world of fantasy seems to be in montesinos blood her 
father fernando rivero was a film director in mexico city and 
worked with such actresses as susan hayward and hedy lamarr 
montesinos recalls being in awe of those women 
i was surrounded by this kind of fantasy they were so 
beautiful i was thinking i wish i could be like that 
montesinos said adding that she doesnt find todays women to be 
as glamorous 
i dont know why maybe its me im sure there are beautiful 
women around but i dont find what i used to find in those people 
the women in montesinos paintings are often colorfully dressed 
with their hair hidden under elaborate hats 
basically in all my paintings the women have a nostalgic 
look she said if i could choose to be in another life i 
would choose the 1900s in europe i have a lot of feelings for 
those places i have read a lot history books about what happened 
there 
one of her paintings is called the venetian 
i get a lot of inspiration every time i go to venice i try to 
go every year its a very serious place i get inspired and try to 
bring what venice was in the 1900s to my paintings i imagine 
people dressed in a lot of gold 
montesinos is concerned that people are more interested in 
material gains than in developing their imagination 
the values have been changing little by little i find people 
have really all their attention on making a lot of money that 
takes a lot of time and energy maybe thats one of the reasons 
they really dont have time to dream 
her paintings of men also have a dreamy romantic feel 
capes and canes long hair she said not the type of man 
that is here right now they were more romantic they could do so 
many things that they dont do now 
montesinos became interested in art as a youngster and was 
encouraged by her father to develop her talent she attended 
college in mexico and argentina studying with the spanish artist 
jose bardasano in mexico and the painter and muralist quinquella 
martin in buenos aires 
she was inspired by diego velasquez and other spanish painters 
what they are doing is real but its also their own reality 
what velasquez did and goya was to paint lets say some flowers 
but it was their own reality and had the feel of flowers she 
said 
they were putting their own lives and their own feelings into 
their work 
montesinos had her first onewoman show in 1971 
i really take painting in a very serious way i know that i 
have to paint and one morning i start painting maybe one day ill 
just paint the face or use the corners thats it without really 
using a lot of thought 
in 1984 she began experimenting with lithography it seemed 
so complicated if i was thinking of something in red id have to 
paint it in black if it was in blue id have to paint in black 
however montesinos caught on quickly and believes lithography 
has helped her painting 
its more complicated than oil you really cant make 
mistakes whatever you put there is there she said you become 
very disciplined if youre going to put something in it has to 
work 
since i started doing lithographs ive been painting much 
faster its much easier for me 
not only is she working faster but believes she is allowing 
more imagination to show up in her paintings 
they are free they are very free she said im not 
concerned about making them real im not pretending to make them 
literal whatever it is for you its ok for me if people ask me 
to explain that painting i ask them to explain it 
what is art art is communication the work of art 
communicates something or it doesnt some people see something and 
say its terrible another person says its wonderful i dont 
think you can give people only one layer

florida is under invasion by a rapidly spreading 
foreign army that threatens to change the face and even the 
climate of the region many of the invaders were invited to help 
improve the economy or beautify the state then turned on their 
hosts 
more than 400 foreign plant species have taken root here 
including the australian melaleuca and indian ficus that are 
spreading alarmingly and the brazilian pepper tree and african 
castor bean poisonous to humans and animals 
the danger to the everglades is so serious that government 
biologists say floridas famous river of grass may disappear within 
a lifetime 
it is going to be very hard for any botanist in the future to 
tell what is native and what isnt says julia morton a 
university of miami biologist who must drive two hours north along 
the highspeed floridas turnpike to see native flora exotic 
plants are multiplying and becoming so widespread they are taking 
over 
ironically the most destructive species were introduced decades 
ago by wellmeaning experts who did not understand the regions 
delicate ecosystem 
the melaleuca tree was planted in the everglades 80 years ago in 
hopes of creating a lumber industry in what was seen as a useless 
wasteland 
its economic potential proved elusive instead the thirsty tree 
from arid regions of australia soaks up the water muscles out 
waterdependent species not used to competition and the chemicals 
in its bark prevent all but the hardiest birds from even landing on 
it 
ten years ago in the east everglades we only found 20 
melaleuca trees says botanist robert doren vice president of 
the states exotic pest plant council now it has invaded 500000 
acres of the park and 50000 acres are essentially pure stands of 
melaleuca within our lifetime it could dominate the park and a 
lifetime isnt very long 
the resultant damage has economic as well as environmental 
implications any major change in the everglades will affect 
surrounding waters drying up miamis drinking water and sabotaging 
the shrimp lobster and fishing industries in the keys and florida 
bay 
one major factor contributing to the spread of the plant pests 
is floridas rapid development most of the plants that are a 
problem do best in disturbed areas you take a naturally balanced 
area then you build canals roads farms and bring in a new plant 
with no natural predators doren says 
about half the 400 foreign plant species that have taken root in 
florida were imported for economic or ornamental reasons said ms 
morton 
one ornamental plant that may haunt floridas future is the 
ficus a rapidly growing tree that can break up streets and 
sidewalks and take over whole yards the plant was imported because 
it was thought unable to reproduce itself here and therefore safe 
dismayed biologists recently have discovered seedlings sprouting in 
sidewalk cracks the hardy tree has found a way to survive without 
the help of man 
beside melaleuca and ficus biologists generally agree brazilian 
pepper and australian pine present the major tree threats to 
florida 
brazilian pepper marked by red berries and imported as a pretty 
bush turns out to grow unabated in floridas hospitable soil and 
climate it spreads seeds everywhere and has covered thousands of 
acres of south florida growing as high as 40 feet with a trunk 
three feet in diameter 
the trees toxic berries have been blamed for massive bird 
kills and it sickens domestic animals and children the bark 
causes a serious allergic rash and its pollen can be disastrous for 
hayfever sufferers ms morton says it too pushes out native 
flora 
a hundred years ago native coco plum trees which produce a 
nice edible fruit used to abound all across the tamiami trail into 
the everglades now you will see very little coco plum and miles 
and miles of brazilian pepper 
the rapidly spreading australian pine thrives in salty coastal 
areas can grow 10 feet in a year and usurps the nesting places of 
endangered loggerhead and green sea turtles as well as the rare 
american crocodile its branches break off easily and its shallow 
root system means a hurricane can easily topple it causing damage 
to anyone or anything nearby 
lesserknown but potentially as destructive pests are 
spreading as well the australian acatia tree looks lovely to 
landscapers but its thick leaves will not biodegrade leaving 
litter that quickly clutters the ground 
a shrubby asian vine threatens to clog coastal waterways doren 
said we find it on coastlines and in mangrove stands no one 
knows how it got here but it does what kudzu does up north 
a polynesian import the lead tree has been found recently and 
in 60 or 70 years could be where the melaleuca is now he said 
ms morton worries about highly poisonous foreign plants many 
of them attractive to animals and children she blames a series of 
unexplained horse deaths outside miami on creeping indigo brought 
to the area by the university of florida in the 1930s as an 
experimental ground cover 
castor beans which now grow all the way to south carolina 
carry toxic seeds that are highly attractive to childrs who are elected 
president rely on a brain trust but 
so does everybody else too as the field becomes more 
specialized said hess even richard nixon who was truly 
engaged in foreign policy and made it his life interest brought in 
specialists notably henry kissinger who served as his national 
security adviser 
graham t allison jr a dukakis foreign policy adviser says 
the massachusetts governors style as a leader and governor is 
quite different from either reagan or carter 
dukakis ideas come out of interaction with other folks there 
is a combination of progressive values and pragmatism that is 
something special it is not classic liberalism said allison 
carters view of the world was shaped by his career as a 
submarine officer in the navy and his devotion to his baptist faith 
he appointed a strongminded national security adviser zbigniew 
brzezinski a columbia university professor of soviet affairs born 
in poland and deeply suspicious of the kremlin 
carter appointed a very different personality as his secretary 
of state cyrus vance a wall street lawyer and veteran of senior 
government appointments who was deeply committed to diplomacy and 
negotiations 
there were two worldviews spinning around at the top level 
of government said hess and the result was a sometimes confused 
and vacillating approach to foreign affairs that ultimately brought 
vances resignation 
allison said carter was very interested in detail he had 
difficulty keeping his mind focused on the big picture and was 
unable to resist an overly expansive agenda 
reagan is very effective at projecting a few central themes 
but does not involve himself directly in the issues neither in the 
broad shape of the issues or in the details but he has kept in 
mind a few simple things and knows what a manageable agenda is 
said allison who is dean of the john f kennedy school of 
government at harvard university where dukakis once taught and 
where he turns for much of his foreign policy advice 
conflicting views of the world at the top of the administration 
were not reagans problem said hess he had a distinct point 
of view that the people who were working for him had no trouble 
following 
reagan survived several overseas debacles including the bombing 
of the marine corps barracks in beirut in 1983 but his handsoff 
management style contributed to the worst policy crisis of his 
administration the exchange of arms for hostages with iran 
clearly reagan has had trouble with national security 
advisers running through six in seven years said hess 
dukakis has not said publicly who he might appoint national 
security adviser or secretary of state if he is elected but among 
those often mentioned for those two important posts are allison and 
two colleagues from the kennedy school joseph nye and albert 
carnesdale along with madeleine albright a czechoslovakianborn 
georgetown university professor who served in the carter white 
house

archaeologists who wear wet suits and 
diving tanks are rescuing relics from an 8000yearold village 40 
feet beneath the sea before water destroys the last remnants of the 
ancient site 
the village which contains the remains of more than a dozen 
stone houses wells and cooking hearths lies about 400 yards off 
the mediterranean coast some 10 miles south of haifa 
it is the bestpreserved neolithic underwater site in the 
world said ehud galili of the university of haifas institute of 
archaeology and maritime studies we are carrying out a rescue 
operation because sea abrasion may soon destroy the site 
each day for two weeks late this summer a search period 
limited by sea conditions and funding galili and about 10 
archaelogists and volunteer divers headed out in a rubber dinghy in 
twos or threes for hourlong underwater stints one operates a 
dredger to clear away sand as others search for artifacts 
the project in its fifth year has yielded 15 human skeletons 
many of them almost intact animal and fish bones several pounds 
of cultivated wheat and lentils and stone and bone utensils 
including arrowheads knives and bowls 
most neolithic sites are in poor condition said university 
of pittsburgh underwater archaeologist jim dwyer who returned this 
year to atlit for the second year in a row here we have the 
chance to find everything ancient man used in daytoday life 
the underwater village is the only neolithic site along the 
israeli coast containing skeletons according to galili 
pathologists studying the bones are discovering details about how 
people lived in the period 8000 to 10000 years ago before they 
learned to use pottery or discovered writing 
the studies show for example that one villager suffered from 
arthritis and another was paralyzed from the waist down one used 
his teeth excessively to string fishing nets galili believes 
while another rowed a great deal 
at least nine other sciences associated with archaeology have 
been applied to the findings he said we have studied the pollen 
of flowers to learn about the climate of the period and applied 
carbon 14 tests to determine how old the site is 
galili was particularly excited to discover cultivated wheat 
because it helped place the village in the neolithic period when 
man after 15 million years of hunting and foraging first began 
to cultivate his own food 
we found several pounds of wheat and lentils he said 
apparently a process of domestication began at this time 
the excavators also found remnants of wild boar and gazelle 
indicating that the villagers remained parttime hunters 
the village was welllocated it was on the sea but protected 
by a bay nearby there was a fresh stream and swamps where cattle 
lived galili said that changed as the planet became warmer 
melting glaciers and raising the sea level by up to 100 yards 
submerging the village 
for thousands of years sand also covered the submerged village 
hiding it and maintaining the artifacts in good condition this 
began to change 20 years ago said galili the findings became 
exposed man intervened in nature and upset the balance they took 
sand for construction and built breakers in the sea the sand began 
to disappear

food supplements which began as public health 
measures have escalated into an array of additives that some 
experts say do more to satisfy marketing than nutritional needs 
especially in the battle for the breakfast table americans 
spend 5 billion a year on cereal vitamins and minerals have 
joined the cereal makers arsenal of eyecatching shapes crisp 
sounds and sugar coating 
sometimes there is a risk of giving customers too much of a good 
thing illustrated by kellogg cos recall in august of 29000 
boxes of frosted miniwheats biscuits cereal with too much vitamin 
a the excess was harmless but could cause a burning sensation in 
the mouth and an off taste 
the benefit or harm of additives is difficult to determine just 
because they are so prevalent said dr mark hegsted a nutrition 
professor at harvard university school of public health studies 
require control groups and we dont have populations that eat 
the same things and dont have them 
food producers like kellogg say consumers look for the 
supplemented foods because of lifestyle changes company 
spokeswoman marie t kitlas referred to a brochure saying cereals 
are fortified to make up for skimpy ontherun breakfasts and to 
maintain adequate nutrition on lowcalorie diets 
some dispute the industry claims the new york attorney general 
obtained an aug 4 agreement from kellogg to stop advertising in 
that state that b vitamins in rice krispies give consumers more 
energy studies indicate the american diet has enough b vitamins 
and most fatigue sufferers do not have vitamin deficiencies the 
state said 
on the other hand no harm has been proven from additives which 
are sprayed on or dissolved into batters 
in todays world most vitamins are chemically synthesized 
but they are identical to the compounds found in nature said 
allan l forbes director of the us food and drug 
administrations nutrition and food science division there is no 
difference whatsoever 
the fda is preparing to impose healthclaim regulations but 
those deal with prevention of degenerative ailments such as cancer 
or heart disease said forbes vitamin and mineral claims usually 
relate to deficiency diseases 
vitamin or mineral deficiencies can be found in parts of the 
population like women and teenage girls who diet excessively and 
among poor people but if you look at the whole us population 
its hard to find a deficiency said university of texas 
nutrition professor sanford miller a former fda official and an 
industry consultant 
there is no sense adding vitamins for which there is no 
deficiency said michael jacobson of the center for science in 
the public interest which raised the rice krispies issue and has 
instituted other similar cases 
supplements first were added at public health officials urging 
as an inexpensive and effective way to deal with specific problems 
jacobson said the federal food and nutrition board endorsed 
supplementing wheat flour in the early 1940s to replace thiamin 
riboflavin niacin and iron lost in milling 
depressionera vagrants suffered pellagra due to niacin 
deficiencies and beri beri due to thiamin deficiencies the 
supplements worked you dont see pellagra in this country today 
you dont see beri beri miller said 
adding iodine to salt virtually eradicated goiter after it was 
found that iodine in fish prevented goiter among coastal residents 
vitamin d was added to milk to prevent rickets in children who 
didnt get enough from sunshine 
what is happening today is a different thing miller said 
companies are adding vitamins to more and more things 
jacobson said they are playing on peoples fears and concerns 
there is no deficiency of those vitamins whatsoever in the american 
public 
the sole purpose is so they can say now fortified with 14 
vitamins 
bruce silverglade the centers director of legal affairs said 
food buyers need to be educated the response of the average 
consumer should be so what that is irrelevant to my diet

a hormone that researchers hope may one day 
help victims of high blood pressure may also contribute to abnormal 
blood clotting increasing the risk of stroke or heart attack 
scientists say 
people with high blood pressure have higher levels of the 
hormone called atrial natriuretic factor or anf they also 
experience abnormally fast clotting apparently because anf also 
appears to help blood clot faster said marc taylor a clinical 
fellow in cardiology at the university of virginia school of 
medicine in charlottesville 
taylor reported his results at the 42nd annual conference and 
scientific sessions of the american heart associations council on 
high blood presure research nearly 60 million americans suffer 
from high blood pressure the heart association said 
taylor who stressed the preliminary nature of the research 
said it is too soon to speculate about what this is going to mean 
in the long term 
every agent that comes along with a beneficial effect always 
has its downside said taylor 
anf has a lot of possibilities for treating congestive heart 
failure and high blood pressure said taylor who still expects the 
compound eventually to be marketed increased blood clotting if 
further research supports the preliminary finding could be listed 
as a side effect he said 
abnormal clotting may contribute to heart attacks said taylor 
whose research revealed anf levels twice as high in people with 
high blood pressure as those with normal blood pressure

mexicanamericans with diabetes run a higher 
risk of developing a potentially blinding eye disease than do 
nonhispanic whites with diabetes a new study suggests 
mexicanamerican diabetics showed more than twice the risk of 
severe retinopathy a complication of diabetes in a study by texas 
researchers 
previous work has shown that mexican americans also have a 
threefold greater prevalence of noninsulindependent diabetes 
than nonhispanic whites do according to the american diabetes 
association 
the new work compared 257 diabetic mexican americans living in 
the san antonio area with 56 diabetic nonhispanic whites from 
wisconsin generally the mexican americans had their diabetes 
diagnosed at earlier ages than the other group and they had higher 
bloodsugar levels 
although they also tended to have lower socioecononomic levels 
than the wisconsin group detailed analysis showed that made no 
differences in the risk of the eye disease

the global warming trend due to the 
socalled greenhouse effect could make droughts in the us 
great lakes region more frequent dropping lake levels and reviving 
nagging questions about whether to divert lake water to parched 
lands a government spokesman said thursday 
for that reason 125 us and canadian scientists meeting at the 
first united statescanada symposium on impacts of climate change 
on the great lakes basin recommended that the two countries start 
attacking the problem of global warming now with joint scientific 
study 
we would like to set a tone of mutual cooperation and 
understanding said alan hecht an organizer of the conference 
and director of the national climate program office in washington 
dc we have a very good opportunity to build a constructive 
relationship 
pollution and gases that trap the suns heat are blamed for the 
greenhouse effect and a finding was announced in toronto last june 
that the earths temperature rose one degree in the last century 
because of it 
scientists are concerned that temperatures could rise as much as 
9 more degrees fahrenheit in the next 50 years if the trend 
continues altering weather patterns around the world as well as 
lake levels and growing seasons there is considerable 
disagreement however over how quickly the earths temperature 
might rise 
dr f kenneth hare of ontarios commission of nuclear safety 
said if the great lakes region does get hotter and drier it would 
affect shipping shoreline recreation and communities fisheries 
agriculture hydroelectric power water quality and sewage

a strain of obese rats with high blood pressure 
may help researchers understand why about half of obese people have 
high blood pressure 
obesity and high blood pressure have long been known to be 
frequent partners but researchers havent understood why 
until now the only way to study the connection between 
obesity and hypertension in the laboratory has been to stuff 
animals with food which is not an ideal approach said dr 
theodore kurtz of the university of california san francisco 
kurtz and his colleagues are using the rats to investigate 
whether obese people develop high blood pressure because of a 
reduced sensitivity to insulin which helps control blood sugar 
levels 
kurtz and one of his colleagues dr harrihar pershadsingh 
suggested earlier this year that in obese people the changes in 
insulin response may affect the ability of cells to regulate levels 
of calcium calcium levels have been shown in turn to be high in 
blood cells of people with high blood pressure the researchers 
said 
the rats are important in testing this hypothesis because doing 
such tests in humans is difficult the researchers said live 
cells must be taken from blood vessel walls in the rats the 
researchers can easily examine the blood vessel walls to see 
whether they too have increased levels of calcium 
kurtz and pershadsingh outlined their investigations in san 
francisco at the annual high blood pressure meeting of the american 
heart association

a container to carry radioactive waste 
to a planned longterm storage site stood up to a 30foot drop and 
being burned over 8000 gallons of jet fuel but needs work to keep 
dust off rubber seals 
despite a tiny leak caused by dust working into rubber orings 
the container did better than expected in recent tests said jim 
tollison manager of waste transportation for the waste isolation 
pilot plant project 
the trupact 2 a stainless steel container built like a vault 
within a vault was loaded with 14 concretefilled 55gallon drums 
then dropped 30 feet onto an unyielding surface three times and 40 
inches onto sixinch spikes six times as well as being burned over 
jet fuel in an open pit 
the leak was caused by concrete flaking off during the 
repetitive tests and the grit working its way through a vent hole 
and into the orings as the tanks were pressurized and 
depressurized working the seal back and forth 
when used to ship waste carbon filters are screwed into the 
vent holes the drums are cradled in a stainless steel vessel 
inside a doublewalled outer container with 10 inches of 
polyurethane insulation between the walls the outer container is 
designed to act like shockabsorbing bumpers on cars 
the lids of both the inner and outer containers are sealed with 
orings that are fourtenths of an inch thick and six feet in 
diameter made of butyl rubber like that used in car tires the 
orings sit in a groove or channel 
the grit wore a channel that let the inner container leak 
though the outer container did not tollison said well have to 
put a dust seal in place just like weatherstripping even though 
the waste wouldnt cause dust 
the package has done an excellent job of protecting the 
contents tollison said last month after tests at sandia national 
laboratories this package would not have leaked and contaminated 
the environment 
trupact stands for transuranic packaging transporter 
transuranic waste a byproduct of nuclear weapons production is 
radioactive and hazardous the doe plans to put 125000 barrels of 
it in a repository excavated from ancient salt beds 2150 feet 
underground near carlsbad it says wipp could be ready to accept 
waste next year for a fiveyear test

farmers who grow corn and most other feed 
grains in 1989 will have to idle only 10 percent of their base 
acreage to qualify for price supports and other benefits 
agriculture secretary richard e lyng announced the plan friday 
this year farmers had to set aside 20 percent under the acreage 
reduction program to qualify for benefits but the drought cut 
yields sharply and siphoned off much of the nations grain

turner network television a hybrid of cable and 
network programming hits the airwaves today in a broadcasting 
venture that will serve as a vehicle for atlanta media magnate ted 
turners collection of classic movies 
viewers who tune in for tnts debut will see vivien leigh as 
scarlett ohara in gone with the wind the mgm classic which is 
the cornerstone of turners collection 
muppet creator jim hensons popular fraggle rock show moves 
from home box office to tnt tuesday the muppet show with miss 
piggy and kermit the frog will follow that afternoon and henson 
has signed on for other projects 
the 24hour network will initially make liberal use of cartoons 
in the daytime and movies at night but turner promises one major 
project a week by 1991 already scheduled are madefortnt movies 
starring martin sheen and son emilio estevez farrah fawcett and 
oscarwinners charlton heston and faye dunaway 
turner owner of cable news network and cnn headline news also 
promises to bid on major award shows sporting events including the 
olympics and major league baseball and other showcase programs 
turner executives say 17 million homes will be able to get tnt 
initially tnt spokeswoman allison berry said early projections had 
tnt in 30 million homes by the end of 1989 or early 1990 but the 
increase in initial contracts may move that to earlier in 1989 
its far less important what they launch with than how quickly 
they get into 30 million homes said larry gerbrandt an analyst 
with kagan and associates in carmel calif 
i think they need to reach 30 million within 18 to 24 
months to keep to their business plan and actually theyd like to 
do it sooner than that 
the network said it will plow 80 percent of its revenues for the 
first three years into original programming and turner himself 
told cable company executives in atlanta for a trade show that the 
network would lose 40 million before breaking even 
if we didnt have the mgm library and the rko and warner 
libraries we never could have started the networks and that was a 
billion and a half dollar investment turner said 
turner acquired more than 3000 films when he purchased mgmua 
entertainment co then sold all but the films to pay for the 
transaction 
the deal left turner saddled with 14 billion of debt and 
raised doubts about whether he could survive that debt has since 
been refinanced and large cable companies have bought interest in 
turner broadcasting system inc gaining seats on the board of 
directors and sayso over large financial decisions 
one of the keys to the success of tnt is the acceptance by 
cable systems whose limited channel space already is overwhelmed 
according to gerbrandt 
i think the general sense in the industry is that tnt is an 
idea whose time has come but hes launching it at a time when 
channel capacity is not exactly abundant gerbrandt said

a contract settlement between deere amp co 
and the united auto workers will likely serve as a pattern for 
future talks between the uaw and caterpillar inc a union 
spokesman says 
the tentative agreement reached saturday averted a threatened 
strike by more than 13000 employees at deere the nations leading 
farmmachinery manufacturer details of the pact werent released 
as the deere talks reached their final hours negotiators for 
caterpillar and the uaw in bridgeton mo agreed friday to extend 
their contract indefinitely and recess talks pending the outcome of 
deere bargaining 
until the pact with deere and the uaw is ratified i wouldnt 
expect to see any change in our status caterpillar spokesman 
mark polzin said 
caterpillar talks had muddled along for two months before the 
parallel negotiations with deere resulted in a tentative contract 
deere was chosen as the target for a settlement or strike 
because union officials believed they had a better opportunity for 
contract gains there 
elliott anderson a chief uaw negotiator in the caterpillar 
talks said the union likely would use the deere contract as a 
pattern for future talks with caterpillar 
caterpillar the worlds largest manufacturer of earthmoving 
equipment with 58800 employees could face renewed union demands 
for job security a reduction in overtime callback of 1000 uaw 
members on layoff and the first merit pay increase in a decade 
the union reportedly has been seeking a threeyear pact and a 3 
percent wage increase in each year 
caterpillar wants to hold down costs and is seeking more 
flexibility in job assignments and scheduling and wants to 
restrict employee mobility and save money on retraining 
if talks break down either side can terminate the contract with 
five days notice and caterpillar could face a strike by 17500 
bluecollar workers at plants in 12 cities in illinois iowa 
pennsylvania colorado and tennesse

the number of working oil and gas rigs totaled 
918 this week week one higher than the previous week baker hughes 
inc reported monday 
last weeks total of 917 was the lowest since the count reached 
894 on aug 1 and appears to reflect continuing softness in the 
crude market said baker hughes economist ike kerridge 
the number of working rigs a year ago was 1127 
baker hughes rig count the widely watched industry index of 
drilling activity reflects the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil as of last friday not the number of rigs producing oil 
houstonbased hughes tool co an oil toolmaker company that 
merged with baker international corp of orange calif has kept 
track of the number of working rigs since 1940 
the rig count reached a peak of 4500 active rigs in december 
1981 which was the height of the oil boom but oil prices plunged 
to less than 10 per 42gallon barrel in the summer of 1986 and the 
rig count also declined dropping to 663 the lowest since hughes 
began compiling figures 
the lowest level this year was the reported 880 rigs on may 2 
among major oil producing states oklahoma had six fewer working 
rigs followed by texas three new mexico two and california and 
louisiana one each 
kansas was the biggest gainer for the week with an increase in 
eight working rigs followed by colorado five wyoming and

transportation secretary jim burnley today 
told automakers they must achieve an average fuel economy of 265 
miles per gallon for 1989model cars higher than required this 
year but less than mandated under a law burnley has the power to 
change 
he said his action cutting 10 mpg off the standard congress 
told manufacturers to meet for 1989 models was designed to help 
the us auto industry compete abroad 
each automaker is required to post an average fuel economy of at 
least 260 mpg for all of its 1988 models that has been the 
standard for the last three model years 
general motors corp and ford motor co had said they could not 
meet the 275mpg standard without significant layoffs 
burnley making the announcement this morning said 
a standard of 275 mpg for model year 1989 would have clearly 
put our domestic fullline manufacturers at a competitive 
disadvantage compared to some foreign manufacturers especially the 
asians who have been building only small cars and can easily meet 
the fuel economy requirements 
arrayed against the automakers in public hearings last month 
were a number of public issues groups which sought even stricter 
fueleconomy standards for reasons ranging from conserving gasoline 
to reducing carbondioxide emissions 
the fueleconomy law was adopted in 1975 to reduce gasoline 
consumption at a time of rapidly rising prices 
the law set a goal of 275 mpg beginning in 1985 but allowed the 
transportation department through the national highway traffic 
safety administration to alter the standard 
it was that provision that enabled the department to set the 
standard at 260 mpg beginning in 1986 and at 265 mpg for the 1989 
model year 
both gm and ford had said a 275 mpg standard would have caused 
layoffs at their auto plants because they would have had to cut 
back on production of larger less fuelefficient cars 
ultimately the job losses to the auto industry and its 
suppliers would have numbered in the hundreds of thousands gm and 
ford said 
gm said burnleys decision was in the best interest of 
american workers and consumer choice and called the 1975 law 
outdated 
ford said the agencys decision recognizes that consumer 
preferences resulting from low fuel prices have placed a 
particularly heavy burden on our efforts to comply with the 275 
mpg standard 
chrysler corp said it would exceed a 275 mpg standard and 
complained that a meaningful gasoline tax would eliminate the 
need for a cafelike regulatory system 
chrysler chairman lee iacocca has taken the position that his 
company has successfully met the fueleconomy level set by congress 
and federal regulators should not change the rules to help 
companies that have been less successful in making fuelefficient 
cars 
the center for auto safety a consumers group often at odds with 
the automakers and their regulators said it intends to file a 
lawsuit seeking to force nhtsa to allow the standard to return to 
275 mpg 
burnleys decision is another cavein by the reagan 
administration said clarence ditlow the centers director it 
is going to cost us jobs as gm and ford continue to make small 
cars abroad

the supreme court today refused to order the 
government to compensate the owner of a nuclear fuel reprocessing 
plant that was denied an operating license as a result of a carter 
administration decision on curbing international nuclear 
proliferation 
the court without comment rejected an appeal by the barnwell 
sc plants owner who says that a changed federal policy cost the 
facility more than 200 million 
the justices also turned down a related appeal by a company that 
signed a contract to transport nuclear fuel to and from barnwell 
a federal appeals court in washington calling the plant one 
of the most remarkable white elephants in the nations history 
ruled in february that plant owner alliedgeneral nuclear services 
is not entitled to compensation 
the plant was denied a license in 1977 when former president 
jimmy carter decided to defer indefinitely the recycling of 
plutonium for nuclear power 
the appeals court said the abandonment of reprocessing was 
intended to bolster the nations credibility in discouraging 
plutonium production abroad 
even though president reagan lifted the ban in 1981 there has 
been no move by the nuclear regulatory commission to license the 
barnwell facility 
most of it stands there empty and forlorn the appeals 
court said 
the appeals court rejected alliedgenerals claim that it should 
be compensated because government inducements prompted the company 
to build the plant 
the government provided the land for the facility and urged the 
company to build it the owners said they said denying the plant 
permission to operate in effect was the same as a government 
seizure of the property without constitutionally required just 
compensation 
but the appeals court said no one has a legally protected 
right to use property in a manner that is injurious to the safety 
of the general public 
there can be no doubt that president carter considered nuclear 
proliferation was a threat and that consequently the processing 
of spent fuel at the barnwell plant was a danger he must avert 
the appeals court said 
the appeals court also ruled against nl industries inc which 
said it invested more than 15 million in transportation systems 
for the barnwell facility 
nl industries signed a contract with alliedgeneral in 1971 to 
provide rail and truck service depots and other facilities to 
carry nuclear fuel to and from barnwell 
nl industries said the government ratified the contract and 
was intimately involved in the development of the 
transportation system 
the cases are alliedgeneral vs us 871902 and nl 
industries vs us 871922

one building juts up like an abstractly 
whittled chopstick the other looks like a stack of bridges 
two new bank buildings in hong kong are striking architectural 
testimonies to the future beyond the return of the british colony 
to chinese rule in 1997 
the taller building recently topped out at 70 stories will be 
completed next spring to house the hong kong office of the bank of 
china the international banking arm of communist china 
the fifth tallest building in the world and the tallest in asia 
it towers above its neighbors as a symbol some say of beijings 
impending dominance of this freewheeling world trade center 
two blocks east is the ultramodern glass and aluminum main 
office of the hongkong and shanghai banking corp commonly called 
the hongkong bank a publicly held corporation that is the colonys 
leading commercial bank it also has some centralbank functions 
and owns subsidiary banks and stockdealing firms around the world 
a radicallooking 52level structure the hongkong bank 
building was completed in 1985 with a whopping 5227 billion hong 
kong dollars 670 million spent on its construction and 
furnishings the bank says 
if the powerful corporation which has offices in over 50 
countries had put its money elsewhere it probably would have 
shaken confidence in hong kongs future as a capitalist haven 
in 1997 china retakes sovereignty over hong kong and its 55 
million people under an agreement between britain and china the 
territory is to enjoy a high degree of autonomy and retain its 
capitalist system for 50 years but doubts about whether the 
agreement will hold up have led to an increase in emigration and a 
general nervousness about the future of capitalism 
michael broadbent spokesman and external relations manager of 
the hongkong bank said the building was put up because we needed 
a new building not because of hong kongs future 
but people did say that if the hongkong bank is prepared to 
spend so much it must be confident in the future of hong kong 
broadbent said 
that is perfectly true we do have confidence in hong kongs 
future 
the bank of china building though taller than the hongkong bank 
headquarters may end up costing less the land for the bank of 
china building cost 1 billion hong kong dollars 128 million and 
the construction cost is set at 11 billion hong kong dollars 
though the two banks compete in some areas people associated 
with the two buildings arent throwing stones at each others costs 
or architecture broadbent of the hongkong bank said he greatly 
admired the bank of chinas new building kellogg wong associate 
partner in the new yorkbased im pei architectural firm that 
designed the bank of china building has been equally gracious in 
his praise of the hongkong bank building 
the hongkong bank was designed by the british architect norman 
foster the building more than 585 feet high has such unusual 
features as a sunscoop across the south side to reflect light into 
a 170foothigh interior atrium bridgelike trusses at five levels 
across the width of the building on which the weight is suspended 
a completely open floor plan 62 escalators a claimed world record 
for one building and prefabricated modules on the ends of each 
floor containing toilet and service facilities 
the building was planned to be flexible and staffers say such 
costly features as movable floor panels made from the same material 
as aircraft flooring have already paid off by making it possible to 
move a whole department in a weekend at low cost 
the bank of china building by contrast surges up from a base 
tier 170 feet square and 170 feet tall making the first tier a 
cube at that level threequarters of the cube continues to rise 
and at higher tiers the building becomes abruptly narrower up to 
the prismshaped top 1220 feet high triangular trusses and 
upwardpointing angles are the main visible features 
its not surprising that the building makes a very strong 
structural statement said wong 
leslie robertson head of a new york structural engineering firm 
that now counts the bank of china as well as the two world trade 
center towers in new york among its supertall clients said the 
building was destined to become a new symbol for hong kong 
but for the japanbased kumagai gumi construction company which 
is doing much of the building work the bank of china is likely to 
be a money loser 
by contract the company will receive 11 billion hong kong 
dollars for its work said martin hadaway project director for 
kumagai gumi but costs have escalated above that with the rise in 
the japanese yen and other factors 
asked how much kumagai gumi would lose hadaway replied i 
dont know but if you take the longterm view your reputation 
in hong kong and china will more than cover the loss eventually

the coowner of the worlds largest 
organic grape vineyard attributes his success and longevity to an 
unusual blend of philosophies he terms environmental capitalism 
thats really what it is its taking the good that goes on in 
the world and making a few dollars off of it and why not said 
steve pavich 39 who oversees the richgrove califbased pavich 
and sons vineyards 
the sheer size of the operation 1400 acres in california and 
arizona is unusual in organic farming circles most organic 
vineyards range from 40 to 200 acres said bob scrowcroft 
executive director of the california certified organic growers 
association 
most organic growers will say the paviches are 10 years ahead 
of everybody in growing techniques and marketing said joyce 
johnson director of the kern county valley action network an 
environmental group 
although pavich is dedicated to organic farming techniques he 
doesnt condemn other growers who use pesticides 
im not telling any other growers that they have to stop using 
pesticides i say if they need to do it to survive thats what 
they need to do he said 
organic farming is an agricultural practice that does not rely 
on the use of synthetic pesticides or fertilizers in california 
growers marketing their produce under the organic associations 
label are subject to strict guidelines on fertilization and pest 
control 
the guidelines are designed to separate the truly organic 
produce from other goods advertised as natural or 
pesticidefree 
pavich never uses herbicides or commercial fertilizers but has 
used what he calls biologically acceptable insecticides the 
pavich ranches havent sprayed at all during the past four years 
were at the top end of the transition now it took us from 
1971 to 1981 10 years to figure out all of the parameters we 
are working with today pavich said at that time we had about 
onetenth of the materials we have today and had to set up much of 
that myself 
information on organic farming techniques was hard to come by 
when pavich began farming 750 acres in 1971 
there is no place where you can have it handed to you on a 
silver platter pavich said 
but the subsequent years of research field testing and 
trialanderror was a long and hard process 
pavich reluctantly offered a few details about his techniques 
which he said took 17 years to perfect and would be in great demand 
in the highly competitive field 
most of it has to do with timing he said when you are in 
tune with that rhythm of what nature is doing then its much 
easier to deal with the problems 
at first pavich spent twice as much money on various organic 
fertilizing techniques than a conventional farm would spend on 
synthetic nitrogen fertilizers now he estimates his fertilizing 
costs are about the same as a vineyard using commercial fertilizers 
pavich and his brother tom 32 accomplished that by planting a 
wide variety of cover crops and using manure fertilizers and gypsum 
to keep the soil productive reduce erosion and hold down the costs 
of pest control 
yields on the pavich ranches are in line with industry averages 
production now totals 1 million boxes annually 
for example pavich says his vineyards in richgrove produce 
about 650 lugs of thompson seedless grapes per acre the california 
table grape commission says average thompson harvest is 600 lugs 
per acre with this years bumper crop however some growers are 
harvesting up to 900 lugs an acre said commission president bruce 
obbink 
a lug is a box containing about 23 pounds of grapes 
some pavich grapes can fetch a 10 to 15 percent premium because 
they are organic but the price usually is in line with the market 
like other organic growers pavich is frustrated by what he 
considers a dearth of research on sustainable farming techniques 
in contrast to the vigorous marketing by agricultural chemical 
companies 
but universities are warming up to sustainable agriculture 
research he feels 
ironically pavich and other organic table grape growers have 
been caught in the crossfire of the united farm workers boycott to 
protest use of five pesticides on table grapes 
the union has issued conflicting statements about how the 
boycott applies to organically grown produce 
like other grape growers pavich says the boycott hasnt 
affected sales but hes had to devote time to defending the 
integrity of his organic crop when ufw pickets demand removal of 
his grapes from stores across the country 
they put a question in a lot of peoples minds and we have to 
answer those he said 
scrowcroft said the recent surge of attention to the ufw boycott 
has ignored what organic activists consider a solution to the 
problem of worker pesticide poisonings and consumer anxiety over 
food safety organic growing 
nobody has identified the positive out there that positive is 
certified organic food he said

more than 2000 hollywood drivers went on 
strike today after a weekend of negotiations with producers failed 
to avert the entertainment industrys second walkout this year an 
official said 
were going to be out a while im sure of that earl bush 
secretarytreasurer of teamsters local 399 said after talks broke 
off at 140 am they want us to strike they want us to break 
the union as far as im concerned 
members of the electricians laborers and plasterers unions also 
have authorized strikes today against the producers said bush who 
estimated the number of workers on strike will total 3300 to 
3500 there was no immediate answer at the offices of the other 
three unions 
the hollywood plumbers union the smallest of five crafts 
unions announced last week it would not strike 
herb steinberg a spokesman for television and film producers 
had said previously that the strike by the 2200 teamsters would 
not cripple the film and television industry hollywood is just 
beginning to return to full speed following the 22week strike by 
the writers guild of america that ended in august 
under their contracts the writers and members of other talent 
unions such as actors and directors cannot honor picket lines set 
up by craft unions such as the teamsters 
bush said the teamsters made several concessions but they were 
all rejected by the producers strikers targeted two sites for 
picketing today the santa monica pier where nbcs hunter is 
being filmed and at the hollywood office of the shows producer 
stephen j cannell about two dozen pickets arrived outside the 
office shortly after 530 am 
teamster driver clyde lucas said he didnt find out about the 
strike until he arrived for work early today at the paramount 
studios i assumed we were going to work lucas said but 
when i arrived at the studios there was a lockout 
federally mediated talks began friday morning following 
thursdays announcement that the union had voted 1441196 to 
reject what the alliance of motion picture and television producers 
said was their last contract offer 
both sides remained at the bargaining table for a series of 
talks during the weekend at the alliances headquarters in suburban 
sherman oaks sundays session which began at 5 pm lasted more 
than eight hours bush said 
bush has called the producers offer the worst contract offer 
ever made to a union 
the drivers are responsible for transporting everything from 
stars to equipment and props to and from the sets said union 
spokesman mike shepherd 
key issues dividing the two sides include overtime rules 
salaries and guidelines for the making of nonunion films some 
teamster drivers are being asked to take a pay cut from 1661 to 
14 per hour 
well strike until we can get a settlement we can live with 
bush said following the vote 
the producers have said their terms are final and there is no 
room for further negotiations they contend the pay cuts are 
necessary if production costs in hollywood are to remain 
competitive 
we have trained drivers and were ready to continue production 
under any circumstances steinberg said previously i dont 
think it will have any impact on production the studios are very 
well prepared

is it really a new era in the stock market 
you might think so as you listen to your broker explain that 
there is a return to quality stocks a deemphasis on daytoday 
events in favor of longterm trends a desire for sensible rather 
than outrageous profits 
it is market of investors they say rather than of traders it 
is one in which people examine priceearnings ratios dividend 
yields and other measures of value it is a market of aware 
knowledgeable investors they say 
it is a market in which people examine basic values and are 
ready to wait patiently for profits to be realized it contrasts 
with the old market of inandout trading tips hunches and 
overnight profits or losses 
but is it a new era hardly 
more accurately it is the forced abandonment of an aberrant 
period in which it might be argued that a large segment of the 
financial community itself abandoned securities as investments and 
promoted casino chips instead 
a new attitude does indeed seem to pervade financial markets 
forced upon them in part by the wrenching collapse of oct 19 
1987 but there is nothing new in a retreat to old values it 
happens every time 
shearson lehman hutton inc among those brokerage houses 
prominently observing the anniversary of the crash writes this 
analytical obituary 
a national impatience has gripped our financial lives we are 
swayed by the latest trade deficit number one day the latest 
inflation forecast the next 
what has been lost is a sense of perspective and of 
proportion an understanding of investing as a longterm economic 
process rather than a series of shortterm events or reactions to 
events 
in its anniversary promotion merrill lynch amp co tells 
americans that it assumed a leadership role before during and 
after the severe market decline in helping to service its customers 
and prevent shortterm panic 
its performance before the fall says merrill lynch was not 
only exemplary but fortuitous 
such yearafter observances however conceivably could provoke 
more questions than praise such as 
who lost perspective and a sense of proportion was it the 
american public or dicetossing traders and even members of the 
financial community 
who promoted shortterm trading in favor of longterm 
investing was it small investors or was it the financial 
institutions including brokerage houses and their sales people 
searching for reasons why the stock market debacle was isolated 
from the economy in general researchers at the university of 
michigan examined data on how americans used their money one 
reason relatively few own stocks directly 
and that brings up the biggest question of all one asked 
repeatedly and still not fully answered 
was the stock market crash a consequence of shortterm trading 
in its various forms of an emphasis on price rather than value of 
a fever generated by all those institutions and parties that could 
benefit from volatility 
that is was it merely a phenomenon of the financial marketplace 
rather than of the entire economy

the supreme court today rejected a challenge 
to the bankruptcy reorganization of manville corp a building 
materials manufacturer that once produced asbestos products 
the court without comment denied an appeal by a company that 
distributed asbestos made by manville which changed its name in 
1981 from johnsmanville corp 
the distributor macarthur co said the bankruptcy proceedings 
unfairly denied it adequate financial protection 
manville filed a bankruptcy petition in 1982 designed to protect 
it against potential liability of more than 2 billion in suits by 
people suffering asbestosrelated injuries 
between 1984 and 1986 manville reached a settlement with its 
insurance companies the insurers agreed to pay the company 770 
million in return for assurances they would not face additional 
claims 
the insurance settlement a cornerstone of manvilles bankruptcy 
reorganization was approved by a federal bankruptcy judge 
the macarthur company said the judges order is valid only if it 
extends protection to macarthur against suits by asbestos victims 
macarthur said it has been forced to accept the burden of suits 
by asbestos victims without the protection of insurance coverage to 
which it is entitled 
but the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in january ruled 
against macarthur 
the appeals court said if the company has any valid claim 
against the insurers its remedy is to seek money from the 770 
million settlement fund created by the insurance firms 
it may well be that macarthur would prefer to assert its 
interest in manvilles property in a proceeding other than in the 
bankruptcy court but such a result is not required by the 
bankruptcy law the appeals court said 
the case is macarthur co vs johnsmanville 872082

additional legal protection 
meanwhile manville corp was given the goahead to emerge from 
six years of federal bankruptcy court protection after the justices 
rejected a challenge to the reorganization of the denverbased

ninety percent of americans believe the 
government should require automakers to build cars with greater 
fuelefficiency according to a poll commissioned by 
environmentalists 
twothirds of the respondents believe they will see another 
energy crisis that could bring back gasoline lines but nearly 
threequarters oppose a 30cent increase in the gasoline tax aimed 
at discouraging consumption according to the survey by the 
analysis group inc a new haven connbased polling firm 
the pollsters telephoned 1000 registered voters from sept 
1014 for the communications consortium a public relations firm 
representing environmental groups the margin of error in the poll 
is about three percentage points 
the consortium released the results monday before transportation 
secretary jim burnley announced his decision to require auto 
companies to average 265 miles per gallon for the 1989 model year 
that is up from the 26 mpg standard required for the past three 
years but less than the 275 mpg requirement that would have 
otherwise taken effect under law 
stanley b greenberg president of the polling firm said an 
inconsistency between the polls results and the popularity of 
larger more fuelhungry cars is clearly true in this area and is 
also true in almost every area of life that you can imagine 
sixtyseven percent of those questioned predicted a repeat of 
energy crises like those of the 1970s 26 percent said it would not 
happen and 7 percent said they did not know 
sixtyone percent gave a strongly favor response to the 
proposition that auto companies should be required to build more 
fuel efficient cars an additional 29 percent reported a somewhat 
favor answer with only 8 percent opposed 
when asked if cars should be required to average 45 mpg in the 
year 2000 a position some environmental groups have endorsed the 
poll respondents split 8215 in favor 
if such a requirement meant a 500 increase in the price of the 
car the split was still 7719 in favor 
though 56 percent favored a 25cent per gallon tariff on 
imported crude oil to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and 
37 percent opposed it 72 percent opposed a 30cent gasoline tax 
increase while only 24 percent were in favor 
by 6429 the respondents favored policies that would encourage 
energy efficiency over increased energy production only 9 percent 
called for a new commitment to the building of new nuclear power 
plants

stock prices retreated in light trading today 
starting off the final quarter of 1988 on a wary note 
wall streeters were generally resigning themselves to a sluggish 
week expecting investors to back away from stocks before the 
government issues its monthly report friday on the employment 
situation 
analysts look for the data to show a pickup in payroll 
employment growth for september after relatively modest increases 
in july and august 
if those estimates prove correct it would come as a setback to 
hopes that the economy was slowing to a pace that would satisfy the 
federal reserve which is seeking to keep inflation from heating up

a stockholders lawsuit against media 
general inc involving the companys twotiered stock structure was 
dismissed monday by a federal judge 
us district judge richard l williams agreed with arguments by 
attorneys for media general that the complaint of harvey jasper a 
new york lawyer who owns 100 shares of company stock did not have 
a strong enough legal basis to proceed to trial at one time 
jasper owned 5000 shares of media general 
williams also rejected an argument by jaspers attorneys that 
the complaint be considered a class action on behalf of other 
holders of media general class a common stock 
jaspers lawsuit contended that a 1987 media general proxy 
statement was misleading about whether the company would accept a 
buyout offer jasper bought stock after the proxy statement was 
issued 
the statement defined in some detail the relative strengths of 
the companys a and b common stock classes he contended he lost 
money on his investments because those who control the stock did 
not state the company never would be for sale 
james w tredway an attorney for media general argued that if 
the proxy statement lacked any clarity the problem was resolved in 
october 1987 when the company issued a statement after the purchase 
of a block of class a stock by hollywood producer burt sugarman 
the company said it could not imagine circumstances in which 
owners of the controlling stock in media general ever would sell 
their shares 
jaspers lawsuit was related to an unsuccessful takeover offer 
from sugarman on feb 29 sugarman proposed to buy all of media 
generals a and b stock for 6150 a share then raised the offer 
to 70 and also sought to have himself and two associates named to 
the media general board at the may 20 annual meeting 
at the time of the meeting sugarman his associates and 
companies he owns or controls held more than 10 percent of media 
generals class a stock 
d tennant bryan chairman of media general and his son j 
stewart bryan iii vice chairman in effect control the company 
through their holdings in class b stock 
the bryans said the firm was not for sale at any price and 
opposed election of sugarman and his associates to the board 
sugarman lost the proxy fight but has sued the company over the 
stock structure and has an appeal pending 
among media generals holdings are the richmond news leader the 
richmond timesdispatch and the tampa fla tribune

knightridder inc said monday it plans to sell its 
eight broadcast television stations partly to reduce its debt that 
has grown to 929 million with its recent purchase of a leading 
electronic information concern 
knightridder which also owns 30 daily newspapers had acquired 
the television stations in four separate transactions over the past 
decade for an aggregate price of 291 million 
each of the stations are affiliated with one of the three major 
networks and are located on the vhf band which runs from stations 2 
to 13 
the company said it planned to sell the stations individually or 
in one or more groups 
the stations put up for sale are wkrntv in nashville tenn 
ktvytv in oklahoma city wpritv in providence ri wtkrtv in 
norfolk va wtentv in albany ny wjrttv in flint mich 
walatv in mobile ala and koldtv in tucson ariz 
charles crane a media analyst for prudentialbache securities 
in new york said the stations could command a price of about 350 
million to 400 million 
he said he expects a number of public and private buyers would 
be interested despite recent weakness in the advertising market 
because each of the stations would go for less thn 100 million 
in trading on the new york stock exchange knightridder rose 
12 cents a share to 4087 
james k batten knightridder president and chief executive 
said the companys board approved the sale in part to pay for its 
353 million acquisition in august of dialog information services 
inc from lockheed corp dialog operates an electronic information 
retrieval service providing more than 320 data bases in areas 
ranging from business to technology science and education and has 
96000 subscribers in 86 countries 
in approving the dialog acquisition we knew it would be 
necessary to dispose of some assets to raise the funds to pay for 
the purchase batten said 
he said the sale will allow the company to convert to cash a 
substantial amount of previously unrecognized appreciation to 
significantly reduce its debt level and to offset much of the 
ongoing earnings per share dilution associated with the dialog 
acquisition 
the dialog acquisition boosted knightridders total debt to 
929 million 
knightridder has owned television stations since 1978 when it 
bought the stations in providence albany and flint from poole 
broadcasting co for 45 million 
it acquired the norfolk station in 1981 from landmark 
communications inc for 48 million and paid 38 million to 
acquire the nashville station two years later from general electric 
co 
knightridder paid 160 million for the stations in oklahoma 
city mobile and tucson from the evening news association in 1986 
as a group the television stations posted operating income of 
145 million on revenue of 1045 million in 1987 compared with 
operating income of 222 million on revenue of 1026 million in 
1986 
frank n hawkins jr vice president for corporate relations and 
planning for knightridder said the company expects the stations 
will post an operating profit close to its 1986 level this year on 
higher revenue 
he declined to say what the company hoped to get for the 
stations he said it hopes to complete the sale by the end of the 
first quarter of 1989 
the investment firm goldman sachs amp co has been hired to handle 
the sale 
prudentialbaches crane estimated the stations have had pretax 
cash flow of about 30 million and that some recent station sales 
have gone at 12 to 14 times cash flow before taxes 
he said knightridder appears to have decided to swap a modest 
growth business for a highgrowth business in moving away from 
broadcasting and into information services 
but he said newspapers will still account for about 85 percent 
of the companys overall profit 
for all of 1987 knightridder earned 1552 million on revenue 
of 207 billion 
batten said the sale fits the companys new strategic direction 
we believe the acquisition of additional newspapers business 
and electronic information companies cable television operations 
and our own stock will help achieve our goals he said 
knightridder is a partner with telecommunications inc a 
denverbased cable operator in tkr cable a cable system with 
about 270000 subscribers in new york and new jersey

their daily 2centsapound limit in all but one contract month 
hog prices fell their daily 1cent limit during the session but

contract for delivery in october at 7235 cents a pound feeder

the dollar weakened monday in response to 
plunging oil prices which were seen as easing inflation pressure 
in the united states and lessening demand for currency to pay for 
dollarquoted oil contracts 
gold prices rose in what dealers described as largely a 
technical and temporary reaction to the metals fall last week 
which also was a response to declining oil prices republic 
national bank quoted bullion at 39695 a troy ounce at 4 pm edt 
up from 39400 late friday 
currency brokers said oil futures prices toward the 
13abarrel level signaled lower inflation in the united states 
and therefore lower us interest rates making investments in 
dollars less attractive 
moreover because most oil contracts are priced in the us 
currency cheaper oil means buyers will not need as many dollars 
therefore said zlatko glamuzina chief currency dealer at banco di 
sicilias new york branch we have less demand for dollars to pay 
for the oil 
other analysts said the dollar was weakened by european press 
reports quoting west german central bank president karl otto poehl 
as saying further erosion of the marks value was undesirable the 
reported remarks implied west germany would sell dollars to thwart 
a steep rise in the currency 
in tokyo the dollar fell 040 yen to 13390 yen later in 
london it was quoted at 13380 yen by the time trading ended in 
new york the dollar fetched 13367 yen down from 13375 yen late 
friday 
the british pound strengthened against the dollar in london to 
16990 against 16905 late friday later in new york the pound 
rose to 17019 from 16935 late friday 
other new york latedollar rates compared with levels late 
friday included 18617 west german marks down from 18690 
15820 swiss francs down from 15830 12097 canadian dollars 
down from 12167 63420 french francs down from 63595 and 
138700 italian lire down from 139350 
latedollar rates in europe compared with late rates friday 
ioncluded 18608 west german marks down from 18725 15785 swiss 
francs down from 15830 63350 french francs down from 63700 
21010 dutch guilders down from 21185 139795 italian lire up 
from 139650 and 12104 canadian dollars down from 12171 
gold prices rebounded in europe and the united states because of 
shortcovering in which dealers buy gold contracts to repay 
borrowed contracts they had sold earlier nevertheless many 
dealers said overall pressure on gold likely would continue to 
erode its value 
on the commodity exchange in new york gold for current delivery 
rose 310 a troy ounce to 39750 
in london gold rose to 39775 from 39445 late friday and in 
zurich it rose to 397 from 396 late friday in hong kong gold

senate banking committee chairman william 
proxmire dwis on monday proposed a parliamentary maneuver that 
would if successful allow congress to pass legislation permitting 
bank holding companies to own securities firms 
the senate in march overwhelmingly passed a bill allowing 
affiliates of bank holding companies to underwrite most kinds of 
securities except corporate stock 
in the house the banking committee and the energy and commerce 
committee have passed competing versions both impose more 
restrictions on banks and offer fewer new powers but the energy 
and commerce version is the most restrictive 
the dispute between the committees has turned into a 
jurisdictional war between energy and commerce chairman john 
dingell dmich and banking chairman fernand j st germain dri 
so far house speaker jim wright dtexas has insisted that the 
two settle their differences before the banking bill comes to the 
house floor 
in a letter last week to wright st germain said he and dingell 
had been unable to agree and he complained that the dingell 
committees overly broad perception of its jurisdiction has 
paralyzed one of the most important banking acts of this 
century 
with congress planning to adjourn at the end of the week 
proxmire is proposing that most of the senate bill be attached to 
an unrelated banking bill already passed by the house other parts 
of the senate bill could be passed separately or linked to an 
unrelated securities bill sponsored by dingell that toughens 
penalties for insider trading 
under the proxmire plan the bankingsecurities legislation then 
could be ironed out in a conference between leaders in both 
chambers before coming up for a vote in the full house and senate 
that way the house rules committee would not have to make a 
decision on the competing jurisdictional claims of dingell and st 
germain 
also in a move to meet the concerns of st germain and of sen 
howard metzenbaum dohio who has threatened to block the 
maneuver proxmire added a series of proconsumer provisions to 
the bill including a requirement that banks cash government checks 
for noncustomers and offer lifeline banking accounts to poor 
people

steve wynn the flamboyant hotel and 
casino operator who sold his golden nugget casino here last year 
has agreed to purchase del e webb corps claridge casino hotel 
for 110 million officials announced monday 
wynns acquisition of the financiallytroubled claridge from the 
phoenixbased company is subject to approval by new jersey gaming 
regulators and atlantic city boardwalk associates the limited 
partnership that leases the claridges real estate 
del webb which has a 10 percent interest in the claridge has 
the management contract for the facility 
the company and atlantic city boardwalk associates have been 
seeking a possible buyer since may for the 501room claridge hotel 
president roger wagner has said more than 170 potential purchasers 
have contacted del webbs investment banker oppenheimer amp co 
about the claridge 
ed wren a del webb spokesman said monday the company suffered 
a 966 million net loss in 1987 with the claridge responsible for 
788 percent of the loss 
from del webbs standpoint we think the completion of this 
sale will provide benefits to investors that might not otherwise be 
available he said 
wren said del webb has been selling off assets in its leisure 
group which includes other casino and recreational properties on 
friday wynn closed a deal to purchase the nevada club casino in 
laughlin nev from del webb for 40 million 
our working relationship with the golden nugget on the sale of 
our other hotel was excellent so we are optimistic about the 
claridge wren said 
wynn could not be reached for comment he did not return calls 
to his office in las vegas nev where he has built a gaming 
empire on the citys famed casino strip 
marvin roffman a gaming analyst with the philadelphia 
investment group janney montgomery scott said wynns reentry into 
the atlantic city casino market could mean intense competition for 
the resorts other gaming halls 
roffman said that because wynns purchase price was relatively 
low his overhead will be lower than anybody else in town so he 
can give tremendous leeway to the bettor 
if he does do this it will have serious implications for his 
competitors because casinos in atlantic city dont like to give up 
even one customer roffman said generally speaking they tend 
to match what the competition is doing to defend their market 
sharebut when you raise the odds you lower what the house wins 
if youre running a highpriced operation you cant do it 
wynn left the atlantic city casino industry in 1987 when he sold 
the golden nugget in the resort to bally corp for 440 million 
the sale was a factor in blocking rival donald trumps efforts to 
take over ballys park place casino hotel in atlantic city

united airlines on monday asked the federal 
department of transportation to reconsider its sept 22 decision 
awarding uniteds lucrative seattletokyo air route to continental 
airlines 
united which had been expected to appeal the decision said in 
a news release that continental had received the route through a 
procedural quirk that united had forged the route into a 
national asset and that competing japanese carriers would be 
elated by a divestiture that would weaken the competitive vigor of 
united 
that is precisely why such a result runs flatly contrary to 
the public interest the statement said 
the transportation department made its decision after the 
justice department refused to challenge a federal court decision in 
august ordering the route be given to continental 
transportation secretary jim burnley reportedly had argued in 
favor of appealing the case but the justice department refused to 
take further legal action 
the court decision favoring continental upheld on procedural 
grounds an administrative law judges original ruling in the 
controversy last year since that administrative judges ruling a 
succession of senior department officials have disagreed over who 
should get the route choosing united at one point and then 
american airlines 
united has flown the seattletokyo route since april 1983 
the seattletokyo route previously was flown by pan american 
world airways but united assumed the route temporarily when it 
purchased pan ams pacific division in 1986 
the transportation department approved uniteds acquisition of 
the pan am routes only under the condition that the seattletokyo 
route be dealt with separately 
stephen wolf uniteds chairman and president contends that the 
selection process was flawed 
the public deserves more from its government than to have a 
vital decision of national transportation policy with such 
important consequences hinge on a procedural accident he said
