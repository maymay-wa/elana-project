a treaty to reduce nato and warsaw pact 
nonnuclear forces in europe will be ready for signing next month 
but a ussoviet pact to curb longrange nuclear weapons is 
lagging even after toplevel talks 
the conventional arms treaty the most sweeping arms control 
pact in history will be signed at a summit in paris by the 16 
north atlantic treaty organization members and the sixnation 
warsaw pact 
secretary of state james a baker iii and soviet foreign 
minister eduard shevardnadze settled all remaining questions about 
armsreduction zones aircraft ceilings and helicopter restrictions 
over six hours of talks friday 
this is a major accomplishment shevardnadze said 
but the soviet official said he and baker were unable to reach 
agreement on every and all issues in the path of a ussoviet 
treaty to cut longrange nuclear missiles by about 30 percent 
that casts doubt on a december summit in moscow between 
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev although 
baker said its still very possible 
he said it depends on settling a dispute over transfers to 
allies of nuclear arms and technology that would be banned under 
the treaty 
baker said he made good progress with shevardnadze on the 
issue known as noncircumvention and that if us and soviet 
negotiators in geneva follow through the two other roadblocks might 
be cleared 
we are tired shevardnadze said but the results are 
good 
the two other unsettled issues concern the kinds of ss18 
missile tests the soviets would be permitted to conduct and whether 
the soviet backfire bomber would be subject to numerical 
restrictions 
between their two sessions friday baker and shevardnadze took a 
break to preside at a ceremony dedicating a new sculpture for the 
united nations that symbolizes the growing superpower rapport 
the work of soviet sculptor zurab tseretel titled good 
defeats evil incorporates pieces of intermediaterange nuclear 
missiles that were dismantled in a 1988 ussoviet treaty 
baker flew home to washington and shevardnadze to moscow 
their chief arms control aides who participated in the talks 
first at the soviet and then the us mission to the united nations 
now will try again in geneva to reach solutions 
and shevardnadze will visit washington next month to try to wrap 
up the treaty with baker 
the conventional forces in europe treaty on which baker and 
shevardnadze did agree would be the largest armscontrol deal in 
history and the first in europe since the end of world war ii it 
would take a much bigger bite out of the soviet arsenal in europe 
than the us arsenal 
nato and the warsaw pact each would be limited to 20000 tanks 
20000 artillery pieces 30000 armored combat vehicles and 2000 
helicopters in the area stretching from europes atlantic coast to 
the ural mountains inside the soviet union

state budget crunches are spreading south and 
west from new england where they began the national governors 
association reports 
the fiscal condition of the states is the worst we have seen 
since the major recession of 1983 nga executive director raymond 
c scheppach said friday in releasing the groups annual fiscal 
survey of the states 
the study attributed the difficulties to a slowing national 
economy increased medicaid costs and the continuing decline in 
federal aid to states 
over half of the states would have ended their most recent 
fiscal year with deficits had they not moved to cut spending after 
their budgets were enacted scheppach said 
states raised taxes by an expected 103 billion the largest 
dollar increase ever the report said twentysix states increased 
net revenues and seven reduced them nearly half the total increase 
came in three states massachusetts new jersey and new york 
state spending was up 77 percent on average in fiscal 1990 but 
it is expected to grow only by an average of 65 percent this year 
scheppach said 
total state yearend balances declined from 125 billion in 
fiscal 1989 to 91 billion in 1990 and are estimated to decline 
to 74 billion in fiscal 1991 
those balances which amount to surplus money after all 
spending averaged 48 percent in 1989 and are estimated to be 
down to 35 percent at the end of fiscal 1991 state budget 
officers consider a 5 percent reserve prudent as a hedge against 
tough times 
a regional economic slowdown that hit new england has caused 
massive financial problems for all six new england states 
prompting the regions three democratic governors to retire and 
leaving two of three republican governors in dire political 
condition in addition new york and new jersey have run into 
financial trouble prompting big tax increases 
what seems to be happening is the turndown in the economy that 
began in new england is now spreading south and west 
scheppach said 
adding to state financial problems is the growth in demands for 
medicaid spending the report said scheppach pointed to figures 
showing states increased medicaid spending by 184 percent in 1990 
and are estimated to increase them 15 percent to 20 percent in 
fiscal 1991

frederick vreelands criticism of burmese 
policies that cost him his nomination as ambassador to rangoon 
simply upheld the position of the us government the state 
department says 
a human rights organization meanwhile urged the united states 
to continue criticizing the burmese military regime and to contest 
its right to burmas seat at the united nations 
burmas ruling state law and order council canceled its earlier 
acceptance of vreeland as ambassador in objecting to his answers to 
questions by senators at his confirmation hearing earlier this 
week 
state department spokesman richard boucher said friday that the 
burmese government informed the us embassy in rangoon on thursday 
of its decision to withdraw acceptance of vreeland the white house 
then withdrew vreelands nomination under the rule that a host 
country must agree to receive an ambassador 
mr vreelands statements reflected the policy and the views 
of the united states government including our oftenstated view 
that the military regime should rapidly implement the results of 
the national elections in may which should lead to a return to 
parliamentary democracy boucher said 
sen alfonse damato rny said thursday that he believed the 
nomination was withdrawn because of questions raised about 
vreelands involvement in what damato said was a cover up of 
possible bulgarian and soviet involvement in the 1981 assassination 
attempt against pope john paul ii 
damato said he had intended to question vreeland at a second 
hearing about his activities in rome 
asked if the withdrawal had anything to do with accusations that 
vreeland was a cia agent involved in suppressing the papal 
investigation boucher repeated that the action was taken as a 
result of the burmese objections 
the state department spokesman declined to answer questions 
related to reports of vreelands cia involvement saying it was 
department policy not to respond to allegations of intelligence 
connections or activity 
he had a career as political and economic officer various 
positions at our embassies overseas boucher said of vreeland 
asia watch a private human rights monitoring group later urged 
the bush administration to maintain a tough stand against rights 
abuses in burma 
in making a new ambassadorial nomination it should put burma on 
notice that the united states regards improvement in the human 
rights situation as its highest priority asia watch executive 
director sidney jones said in a statement 
ms jones also urged the administration to object to seating the 
burmese delegation when the credentials committee report is 
presented next week at united nations headquarters

a housewife constantly racing to keep up 
with her active 4yearold son has found a hightech way to get him 
home in a hurry she beeps him 
when jonathans beeper goes off he is home which is nice he 
cant argue he cant say just a minute said pat hammett 
its convenient in that i dont have to stand out and yell for 
five minutes and be one of those screaming mothers 
the beepers designed for children are the creation of leslie and 
john gilmore who founded kid konnection in this denver suburb 
about a month ago 
the pagers come in brightly colored cases that can be worn on a 
childs waist they can be leased for 14 to 18 a month which 
pays for the beeper and the paging service mrs gilmore said 
so far the fledgling company has received more than 200 
inquiries and its clients include a boulder teenager and a 
hearingimpaired child whose beeper vibrates 
i think it gives children a sense of responsibility rather 
than having mom come out screaming at them mrs gilmore said 
the couple came up with the idea after mrs gilmore quit her job 
as manager of a local boutique to stay home with her sons 
christopher 4 and jeffrey 18 months 
like her neighbor mrs hammett mrs gilmore had trouble keeping 
up with her 4yearold 
i thought there ought to be a way to communicate with him when 
im in the house and hes out she said 
christopher said hes happy with the arrangement 
it protects me he said when it beeps i come in 
mrs gilmore said it just has become so routine for him like 
brushing his teeth 
although the kiddie beeper is a novelty with a purpose some 
wonder whether it will cause a hightech communication gap 
mitch handelsman an associate professor of psychology at the 
university of coloradodenver says the potential problem doesnt 
have to surface 
just as tv can be useful if there is sufficient communication 
this beeper technology can become a part of optimal family 
functioning as long as it does not substitute for important 
communication he said 
the beepers also arent foolproof 
some children will find 100 creative ways to lose the 
beeper handelsman said 
mrs hammett said that although her son does not leave the house 
to play without his beeper the device has not made her complacent 
i consider myself an overly protective parent she said i 
still poke my head out the door

in a surprise turnaround britain has declared it 
is ready to tie the pound to europes exchange rate mechanism 
the decision is apt to bolster both european efforts to 
integrate the continents economies and british attempts to harness 
domestic inflation however prime minister margaret thatcher 
stressed her continued opposition to creating a single european 
bank and a single currency 
the announcement friday by chancellor of the exchequer john 
major was coupled with word that britains base interest rate will 
drop by one percentage point to 14 percent on monday 
the pound is joining the european exchange rate mechanism at a 
high level which the government hopes will ease britains 106 
percent inflation rate the countrys switch from a freefloating 
currency to a linked one is designed to promote economic stability 
by limiting disruptive exchange rate movements 
the pound and stock market rose sharply on the news because 
joining the mechanism would set a stable floor under the currency 
the sterling joins nine other european community currencies in 
europes exchange rate mechanism the spanish peseta the german 
mark the french franc the dutch guilder the italian lira the 
belgian and luxembourg francs the danish krone and the irish 
pound 
the portuguese escudo and the greek drachma are the only 
remaining outsiders 
thatcher agreed in principle to link the pound to the other 
currencies at a community summit meeting in madrid last year but 
she said she would move only when britains inflation rate was 
lower to the european average of 55 percent 
britain decided to go ahead because britains doubledigit 
inflation is expected to decline mrs thatcher said 
the twin moves of entry into the 11yearold mechanism and the 
onepoint interest rate cut are right for the times the prime 
minister said speaking outside 10 downing street her residence 
the fact that our policies are working and are seen to be 
working have made both these decisions possible she said 
entering the exchange rate mechanism would underpin our 
antiinflationary stance she said 
opposition labor party leader neil kinnock said it was correct 
to cut interest rates and join the mechanism but that the moves 
were action of cornered government 
britain previously linked the pound to other currencies from 
1944 to 1971 under a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates 
it then participated in a rate movementlimiting european snake 
until 1973 
the pound which has risen sharply in recent months on 
speculation that it would soon join the exchange rate mechanism 
soared to 19455 from 19185 before the announcement and to 
29933 marks from 29492 marks 
londons stock exchange extended trading for an hour because of 
the announcement the financial timesstock exchange 100share 
index closed friday at 21439 up 735 points or 36 percent

arts patrons hailed a cincinnati jurys acquittal of a museum 
and its director for exhibiting sexually graphic robert 
mapplethorpe photos but critics of the photos said the battle is 
not over 
a municipal court jury on friday acquitted cincinnatis 
contemporary arts center and its director dennis barrie of 
pandering obscenity and using children in nudityrelated material 
barrie could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined 
2000 and the gallery fined 10000 if convicted of both 
misdemeanors 
i am truly astounded said david ross director of the 
institute of contemporary art in boston where the traveling 
mapplethorpe exhibit closed friday i had expected the jury to 
convict i am more proud to be an american today 
floyd abrams a new york city lawyer who specializes in first 
amendment cases said similar cases may arise however another 
prosecutor could think ill do it differently ill do it better 
put me in front of the jury 
he also cautioned that the cincinnati trial alone could 
discourage controversial museum exhibitions 
freedom of expression is worse off today than it was the day 
before the indictment but better off than it was yesterday he 
said 
in tupelo miss the rev donald wildmon who heads the 
conservative american family association said the acquittal does 
nothing to end the fight to prevent the national endowment for the 
arts from using tax dollars to finance artwork his group considers 
pornographic and religiously offensive 
endowment officials said nea chairman john e frohnmayer would 
not have any comment on the verdict 
this is not a landmark pearl harbor decision wildmon said 
this was just another obscenity trial he said another court in 
another city could have ruled differently 
but elliot mincberg legal director of the liberal people for 
the american way action fund in washington dc called the 
verdict a clearcut victory for free expression and the first 
amendment 
todays verdict is a repudiation of the far rights campaign 
to vilify artistic expression in america mincberg said 
joy silverman ssociate director of the national campaign for 
freedom of expression a nonprofit group representing artists 
applauded the courage of the jurors in cincinnati 
they have not caved in to the censorship hysteria initiated by 
members of the far right said ms silverman 
conservative lawmakers and religious fundamentalists have led 
the fight against the neas partial financing of the touring 
exhibition of photos by the late mapplethorpe several of which are 
sexually graphic 
ralph reed a spokesman for the rev pat robertsons christian 
coalition said we are disappointed in the outcome but this is a 
long struggle and we recognize that we cannot win every case 
the 2 live crew verdict in florida earlier this week more than 
counterbalances this unfortunate verdict 
a record store owner was convicted of obscenity wednesday in 
fort lauderdale for selling a sexually explicit album by the rap 
group 
debbie bennett public relations director for 2 live crews 
label luke records said the cincinnati jurys decision encouraged 
her on the eve of the rap groups own obscenity trial next week 
i guess america is looking up she said

university of the district of columbia 
students ended a protest that immobilized the school for 11 days 
but they failed to win their chief demand ouster of the most of 
the schools trustees 
after allday discussions friday students accepted a agreement 
in which trustees agreed to lobby the city council to restructure 
the board and expand it from 15 to 21 members 
school officials also granted nearly all of about 40 other 
student demands for improvements in academic and athletic programs 
this is a new day at udc protest leader mark thompson told 
a crowd of cheering students late friday night never again will 
a udc student be referred to in a negative light we have proven 
that we are concerned about our situation here 
we have reached an agreement that will serve the university 
well trustee a knighton stanley said never again will 
students at udc be implied to be inferior to any students in the 
united states of america 
several dozen protestors at the 12000student public 
institution seized control of a university building sept 26 
demanding that the 11 mayoral appointees to the board resigned 
the students claimed the board was controlled by political 
friends of mayor marion barry who allowed the schools quality to 
deteriorate they also said the schools accreditation was in 
jeopardy 
students voted to approve the agreement only minutes before an 
11 pm deadline set by trustees who said they would withdraw the 
offer and end negotiations at that time 
thompson said students would remain in the building until a 
signing ceremony set for 1230 pm sunday 
talks had stalled for several days over the issue of the 
resignations with most board members refusing to quit board 
chairwoman nira long resigned effective oct 16 however 
stanley said two board members who agreed to resign did so for 
personal reasons that had nothing to do with the protest stanley 
offered his own resignation to speed along dialogue 
a source close to the negotiations said trustees regarded the 
students request for resignations as foolish 
such a move would have put the school in a legal limbo opened 
the trustees to charges they had abandoned their fiduciary 
responsibilities and jeopardized the schools accreditation said 
the source who spoke only on condition of anonymity 
trustees decided to end negotiations friday night if no 
agreement had been reached because they feared students leaders had 
lost control of the protest the source said

american bishops at a vatican meeting said 
the roman catholic church should keep the rule of priestly 
celibacy despite criticism that it is driving some potential 
candidates from the ministry 
if the church is singing the same tune as everybody else who 
needs the church archbishop daniel e pilarczyk of cincinnati 
head of the us bishops conference told reporters friday 
thats why i am persuaded that celibacy is much more important 
than it has ever been before 
he and other prelates at the international synod said the church 
and celibacy represent a countercultural force showing there is 
more to life than the pursuit of personal satisfaction 
the issue of celibacy has been raised numerous times during the 
first week of the monthlong synod an advisory body convened by 
pope john paul ii to discuss the formation of priests more than 
200 bishops are attending 
the pope has indicated he will not change the celibacy rule and 
the vatican moderator at the synod has said the issue should not 
even be discussed still some bishops have questioned the 
requirement and suggested that allowing ordination of married men 
could help alleviate the shortage of priests in some areas 
the number of priests in the world has dropped from 406000 to 
400000 the past five years in the united states the number of 
students in the last four years of seminary was 3698 this year 
compared with 7855 in 1968 
the celibacy rule is based on the view that sex and marriage 
would prevent the priest from giving his complete attention to the 
work of god 
in his comments pilarczyk dismissed the idea that the number of 
priests should be used as a yardstick of the strength of the 
church 
its not necessarily the case that the more priests youve 
got the better off the church is pilarczyk said 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago said steps must be taken to 
halt the erosion in the understanding and appreciation of 
celibacy 
there are many positive values to celibacy he said i 
think the people who can best espouse those values are the 
priests themselves you hear some priests complaining but there 
are many many wonderful priests the vast majority who live a 
chaste celibate life and get a great deal from their ministry 
the american church was shaken this summer when archbishop 
eugene a marino of atlanta resigned following revelations of a 
twoyear intimate relationship with a young woman 
however bernardin said the percentage of amercan priests who 
have been involved in sexual scandals is really very small 
we dont want to downplay or minimize the seriousness of those 
problems that do exist he said we are trying to handle them 
as best we can 
a canadian prelate auxiliary bishop frederick bernard henry of 
london ontario told the synod wednesday that the church needs 
programs of psychosexual testing to monitor the sexual maturity of 
priests 
he noted that recent cases of sexual abuse by priests had caused 
deep soulsearching in the canadian church 
in july a churchappointed commission reported priests had 
sexually abused boys in newfoundland for more than a decade and the 
church had failed to stop the practice

sexually graphic photos by robert mapplethorpe 
have artistic value a jury ruled in acquitting an art gallery and 
its director of obscenity charges in a closely watched trial 
a hamilton county municipal court jury friday cleared 
cincinnatis contemporary arts center and its director dennis 
barrie of one count each of pandering obscenity and using children 
in nudityrelated photos in the exhibit robert mapplethorpe the 
perfect moment 
barrie said he was grateful at the outcome in the nations first 
obscenity trial of an art gallery but lamented that battles over 
artistic freedom were still being waged 
im glad this fight is over in cincinnati but its not over 
in the rest of our country he said i will be in a number of 
cities speaking about this issue 
next week in florida members of the rap group 2 live crew face 
trial on obscenity charges for performing songs from their sexually 
explicit as nasty as they wanna be album which a federal judge 
had ruled obscene earlier this week a florida jury found a 
recordstore owner guilty of obscenity for selling the album 
barrie smiled slightly as the first of the four innocent 
verdicts was announced and his smile widened as a court clerk read 
each subsequent verdict gallery supporters shouted and applauded 
the fourman fourwoman jury composed mostly of workingclass 
suburbanites reached its verdict after five days of testimony and 
two hours of deliberations 
if barrie had been convicted of both misdemeanor charges he 
could have been sentenced to one year in jail and fined 2000 the 
gallery could have been fined 10000 if convicted on both counts 
this was a major battle fought here today not some minor 
incident in the city of cincinnati barrie said it was a major 
battle for the arts and for creativity and for the continuance of 
creativity in this country 
the rev donald e wildmon whose american family association in 
tupelo miss has fought national endowment for the arts funding 
for exhibits such as mapplethorpes said the trial was not that 
significant 
this is not a landmark pearl harbor decision this was just 
another obscenity trial wildmon said i think this really puts 
the nea issue right back in the political arena where it belongs 
barrie 43 testified during the trial that he and the gallerys 
board had never wavered in their decision to bring the 
controversial exhibit to cincinnati 
robert mapplethorpe was a great artist it was a beautiful 
show it should have never been here in court he said 
mapplethorpe died of aids at age 42 in march 1989 
the cincinnati charges were based on seven photographs a grand 
jury cited from the 175photo exhibit five of the photos have 
homosexual or sadomasochistic subjects two show children with 
their genitals exposed 
the exhibit attracted little attention in its first showings in 
philadelphia and chicago but in washington it angered sen jesse 
helms rnc and other congressional conservatives 
their attack forced the corcoran gallery of art to cancel the 
show in mid1989 it also prompted the new director of the national 
endowment for the arts john frohnmayer to require that artists 
sign a statement agreeing to not use nea funds to make obscene art 
some have turned down grants in protest 
the exhibit drew more than 80000 people during its sevenweek 
run in cincinnati an attendance record for an art exhibit in the 
city the traveling show closed this week in boston where 103000 
tickets were sold 
during closing arguments assistant city prosecutor frank prouty 
told jury members it was up to them to decide the artistic merit of 
the photographs 
are these van goghs these five pictures he asked as he 
went into graphic descriptions of the photos of the adults 
h louis sirkin barries attorney said the photos undoubtedly 
offended some people but had serious artistic merit 
he also reminded jurors that the same exhibit was shown in other 
cities without incident 
is cincinnati that different are we that childish sirkin 
asked are we not big enough to say we cant accept what other 
cities have seen

a preliminary investigation has discredited 
allegations that a national institutes of health researcher falsely 
claimed to have discovered the virus that causes aids the head of 
the nih said 
dr william f raub acting director of the bethesda mdbased 
institutes said friday however that he had ordered a fullblown 
investigation despite the fact that the initial inquiry had 
resolved certain of the publicized allegations and issues or 
shown them to be without substance in the case of dr robert c 
gallo 
raub said gallo and gallos research team in the laboratory of 
tumor cell biology found the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
on their own 
gallos group had a substantial number of hiv detections and 
isolations from several different sources at the critical time 
that gallos lab was growing both the virus it isolated and a virus 
it had been given by a french team 
independent discovery of the virus has been credited to both 
gallos team and the pasteur institute team led by dr luc 
montagnier montagniers team published its results first and the 
french and united states governments agreed to settle a lawsuit 
over priority with researchers from both teams sharing royalties 
from the blood test 
in an article published last november the chicago tribune 
raised questions about whether gallos team found the virus on its 
own or found inadvertently or otherwise what it had been given by 
the french team 
nih said its preliminary investigation determined that gallos 
team found the virus independently 
raub said the formal investigation will try to determine the 
origins of the virus that gallo and his colleagues used to develop 
the blood tests 
subjects of the investigation are dr gallo and dr mikulas 
popovic raub said 
he said the investigation would focus on several aspects of 
published reports by gallos team particularly the may 4 1984 
article by gallo popovic and others in the magazine science that 
announced discovery of the virus 
an nih spokesman said the other authors are not being 
investigated 
raub said investigators would test a number of biological 
samples in an effort to determine the origins of the virus used 
to develop the blood test used today to detect hiv 
raub did not say what several aspects he had in mind and 
the spokesman don ralbovsky said we really cant go into other 
detail 
the investigation will be conducted by the office of scientific 
integrity an arm of nih with consultants nominated by the 
national academy of sciences and its affiliate the institute of 
medicine 
there was no answer at gallos home friday night

moslem guerrillas claim to have 
captured a provincial afghan capital after several days of heavy 
battles 
the rebel report came during escalated fighting in afghanistans 
10yearold civil war 
a spokesman for the moslem insurgents based in pakistan hamid 
karzai said the guerrilla forces on friday overran terin kot 
about 180 miles south of kabul the afghan capital he said the 
victory followed several days of heavy battles 
some islamic green flags of the insurgents flew from buildings 
in the city the capital of uruzgan province however it was not 
possible to confirm the rebels claim that they controlled it 
the assault on government troops defending terin kot was 
launched by guerrillas of several rebel groups with headquarters in 
pakistan 
for more than a dozen years usbacked rebels have been 
fighting to topple kabuls government 
moslem insurgents reportedly control much of the countryside 
but they have been ineffective in destroying government defenses 
around most cities and control only a handful of the towns 
moscow has been the major backer of the government in kabul 
however the soviets withdrew the last of their soldiers from 
afghanistan in february 1989 
since then president najibullah has tried to distance himself 
and his party from its communist roots claiming to have rekindled 
the spirit of islam 
rebel leaders have dismissed that effort and vowed to press on 
with their efforts to overthrow his government bitter feuding 
among rebel leaders has stymied the resistance however 
for several months moscow and washington have been trying to 
work out a settlement to end the war 
they are reportedly close to an agreement that calls for new 
national elections the stumbling block has been the composition of 
a caretaker administration to oversee the vote 
after a lull of several months renewed fighting and rocket 
attacks have been reported throughout the country earlier this 
week 61 people died and scores were injured in rocket attacks on 
the afghan capital

parents of young gang members and other 
children exposed to street violence are snapping up lowcost life 
insurance policies designed to soften the blow of burial and 
funeral services 
one insurance salesman said doortodoor sales calls in some of 
the citys most gangplagued areas were paying off especially when 
they were made shortly after shootings in the neighborhood 
we are doing fantastic business said magdy barsoum an 
inglewood district manager for american national insurance co 
insurance industry officials challenged the ethics of such sales 
calls but barsoum defended the practice saying otherwise many 
would not be able to obtain needed coverage 
parents are finding out that a lot of young kids are dying 
from gangs shootings and accidents we pay out 70000 to 80000 
a month on violent deaths barsoum said 
the 10amonth policies typically provide 5000 to 10000 in 
coverage many are bought simply to cushion funeral and burial 
costs that average 4000 he said 
barsoum said his 30 sales agents scan newspapers for reports of 
driveby shootings and other gang violence then move quickly 
articles in hand to the afflicted neighborhoods 
such crime stories are one of our best sources for 
customers barsoum said we take the newspaper out with us and 
say look here your kids are in danger 
american national officials at company headquarters in 
galveston texas do not approve 
if there is any truth to that type of marketing it will be 
discontinued company spokesman dan wood said thats certainly 
not the way we do business never has been 
this is not the kind of practice we would support or what our 
code of ethics outlines as an appropriate practice said betty 
combs spokeswoman for the california association of life 
underwriters 
it is inappropriate to play on peoples fears she said 
life insurance is a product to be sold to families in need not 
on what their fears are 
others say the technique provides coverage to residents in poor 
neighborhoods who otherwise could not afford premiums set by 
territorial rating which often produces high rates in lowincome 
areas 
i have never heard of an insurance company actively seeking 
out a market like this said gene grabowski spokesman for the 
american council of life insurance in washington but it sounds 
like they are being smart by providing a need 
barsoum has some satisfied customers darryl redford 21 said 
he purchased a 10000 policy in july after a rash of driveby 
shootings 
ive seen too many people get shot redford said heaven 
prevent me from getting caught in a crossfire but this insurance 
will bury me if i do

an air force decision to award two new 
contracts to a division of the northrop corp that is under 
suspension is being criticized by the chairman of a house panel 
combine this with the navys disclosure at our last hearing 
that it had granted a waiver to purchase 104 gyroscopes for the 
harrier jet and it appears that the suspension is not even a slap 
on the wrist said rep john conyers the michigan democrat 
chairs the house government operations committee and its 
subcommittee on legislation and national security 
northrop corps precision products division was suspended from 
doing business with the pentagon about 15 months ago the company 
earlier had been indicted for allegedly falsifying test results on 
the harrier jet fighterbomber and airlaunched cruise missile 
on sept 19 the air force the suspension to purchase 
replacement parts for gyroscopes on the minuteman missile and those 
used in the paved penny laser target identification system on the 
a10 and a7 aircraft 
the air force said in a statement that it had granted the waiver 
to insure paved penny equipped a10s deployed for desert shield 
have sufficient spares to support nighttime operations with 
precisionguided munitions 
operation desert shield is the defense departments code name 
for the deployment of us forces in the persian gulf 
the air force said it waived the suspension for the minuteman 
parts because they had become critically short due to utilization 
rates and manufacturing lead times 
such a shortage would adversely affect the highalert status 
required for this important part of our security deterrence said 
maj phyllis phippsbarnes 
conyers previously held a hearing on the av8b harrier jet four 
of which the marine corps grounded because of faulty sensors that 
stabilize the aircraft 
at the session col james hart the marine corps officer for 
the program said it had waived the suspension against northrop to 
buy a package of spare rate sensor assemblies for 300000 for the 
harrier 
in the statement criticizing the air force conyers leveled a 
new attack against the harrier which costs 20 million per 
aircraft over the past six years six servicemen have been killed 
in accidents involving the aircraft 
the most recent incident occurred tuesday when a marine jet 
pilot was killed during a training mission in north carolina 
it defies my imagination that the navy finds acceptable these 
losses and continues to operate a system with such a high fatality 
rate and proven record of severe reliability problems conyers 
said 
the marine corps has nearly 200 harriers made by 
mcdonnelldouglas corp under license from a british manufacturer 
the harriers needing no runway to take off can be based in 
forest clearings and other unorthodox places to provide close 
support and air cover for marine units

the government was forced to shut down 
temporarily three times in the past decade due to squabbles between 
the administration and congress over the budget 
the government closed briefly in november 1981 when an 
estimated 400000 employees were dismissed at midday after 
president reagan vetoed an emergency money bill 
on october 4 1984 about 500000 government workers were sent 
home by congress failure to approve an appropriations bill 
but they were told to be back at their desks the next day after 
the senate late in the day adopted an emergency spending measure 
on october 16 1986 the government sent 500000 nonessential 
employees home at midday but congress later in the day passed an 
appropriations bill acceptable to reagan and workers were ordered 
to report on their next shift 
more than 1 million employees including more than a million 
who work for the defense department stayed on the job those who 
got the halfday furlough included the presidents maids and 
gardeners 
only one out of four employees was considered nonessential 
congress as it had done in 1981 and 1984 passed a resolution 
ordering that employees furloughed get their regular salaries 
anyway payments to furloughed workers cost the government an 
estimated 85 million in 1981 and 65 million in 1984

a defensive mayor david dinkins apologized 
publicly to municipal union leaders saying they were justifiably 
annoyed about his abrupt proposal to lay off up to 15000 city 
workers 
the unions should have been advised beforehand the mayor 
said friday we were going to do it but it happened in a time 
frame that did not make it possible thats no excuse 
dinkins said thursday that he may be forced to send out pink 
slips to deal with an expected budget deficit in fiscal 1992 of 
14 billion the move puts new york among other northeastern 
cities that are letting workers go because of a sluggish economy 
bordering on recession 
the citys proposed layoffs and other agency reductions would 
save the city 800 million the mayor also ordered an immediate 
freeze on hiring and merit raises in order to save another 115 
million in payroll costs 
the announcement drew criticism from the unions that put dinkins 
over the top last november and made him the first black mayor of 
new york the outcry came because dinkins had not consulted his 
allies first 
the mayor has declared war on the unions in the city he has 
spit in the eye of public employees through this unilateral 
action said barry feinstein president of teamsters local 237 
which has about 12000 city workers 
i feel betrayed i swear i really do stanley hill 
executive director of district council 37 which represents 140000 
city workers said friday 
we have a tremendous problem those 15000 workers are going 
to come from the guts of us 
the mayor also has proposed new taxes to close a 18 billion 
budget gap for this fiscal year this week new york went on a 
fiscal roller coaster ride 
on monday it settled its first union contract with a 55 
percent raise for teachers union leaders including feinstein and 
hill said then that they expected the city to be as generous with 
them 
on tuesday the mayor proposed a 18 billion plan to fight 
crime in the city including the hiring of nearly 8000 police 
officers and a severe increase in taxes 
hill said the hurt lingered despite an apology he said the mayor 
offered overnight 
we helped elect him he only won by 2 percentage points he 
knows we played a vital role in making sure he won hill said 
we didnt have to fight this hard to elect a mayor who would lay 
off 15000 workers 
the city faced an even worse budget crunch in 1975 when it 
nearly went bankrupt and laid off about 25000 workers this time 
new york joins new haven boston philadelphia trenton nj and 
baltimore in using layoffs to balance the budget

president bush vetoed a bill that would mean 
strict quotas on imports of textiles and shoes 
bush in vetoing the bill friday said the measure picks the 
pockets of us consumers by driving up prices to the tune of

forcing a collapse of international trade talks 
congress had ignored bushs veto threats in adopting the 
legislation which imposes quotas on imports of textiles textile 
products and nonrubber shoes

economy increase already artificially high costs to consumers of 
several basic goods and abrogate our international agreements 
bushs veto message said

industry was doing well domestic production has been up slightly 
since 1987 he said and unemployment in major textileproducing

was arrested on suspicion of having taken 81000 in bribes from 
two gangsters in exchange for providing information about police 
operations against the gang

against police joined the disturbance at first but gradually 
dropped out while outside hooligans and students as young as

2to1 margin 
i have compassion and sympathy for bob but all of a

a mosquitoborne encephalitis outbreak 
is likely to spread in florida because the bloodsucking bugs 
flourish through middecember in the warm moist climate 
scientists say 
the state department of health and rehabilitative services on 
friday confirmed 28 cases of st louis encephalitis and listed 10 
more as likely cases involving the often disabling disease all in 
central and south florida 
where it goes from here is anybodys guess department 
spokesman ernie durfee said in tallahassee 
since the outbreak was first identified in midaugust the 
hardesthit area has been the states central atlantic coast 
indian river has 10 cases and three more presumed to be 
encephalitis 
orange county with the states biggest tourist attractions 
has three confirmed and another person presumed to have it 
fifteen people are hospitalized and two both over age 55 are 
comatose health officials said 
researchers said they suspected as early as june that an 
epidemic was imminent in florida because of rainfall patterns and 
the number of test chickens found to have been bitten by infected 
mosquitos 
we watched the epidemic unfold in front of us right from the 
beginning and we feel that possibly the worst part of the 
epidemic may still be ahead said jonathan day an entomologist 
with the university of floridas institute of food and agricultural 
sciences 
encephalitis is an inflammation of the brain causing fever sore 
throat headaches confusion and muscular weakness in severe cases 
of this incurable disease it causes convulsions coma and death 
the carrier is a small brownish common backyard mosquito that 
officials say is relatively timid and bites only during nighttime 
hours 
durfee said infants and those over 55 are most susceptible 
because babies have undeveloped immune systems and older people 
have depressed immune systems 
the st louis strain last surfaced in florida 13 years ago with 
110 cases confirmed and eight deaths attributed to it 
the disease is cyclical occurring every 10 to 15 years because 
of a combination of factors such as rainfall and mosquito 
hatchings durfee said 
but not all mosquitoes are carriers out of every 1000 
mosquitoes at random in florida four could carry the type virus 
and out of those four the number that have it is very low 
generally less than 1 percent durfee said 
ten to 14 days after a mosquito becomes infected it can 
transmit the virus through its bite mosquitoes cant pick up the 
virus from infected humans but they can from infected birds 
weve been sampling mourning doves common grackles blue 
jays cardinals mockingbirds and boattailed grackles day said 
in the mourning doves and common grackles were looking at 100 
percent infection

catholic leaders gathered this weekend to plan 
ways to attract the babyboom generation an age group that tends 
to shy away from active catholicism 
the membership is acknowledging that their members are getting 
grayer getting older said paul k henderson of the national 
conference of catholic bishops in washington the institution 
recognizes itself that there is a significant component of the 
population missing 
data indicate the average parishioner is 47 years old while the 
average age of an american is 22 said john fontana chairman of 
the regenerating catholicism steering committee 
theres a gap there its a gap that almost begins with the 
baby boomers and beyond fontana 40 said in an interview 
friday the first day of the convention the meeting ends sunday 
besides thorny issues like the churchs blanket condemnation of 
abortion and birth control a national trend of declining interest 
in religion persists 
its not just the catholic church having this problem he 
said its also a problem in mainline protestant churches 
william mccready a publicopinion researcher from northern 
illinois university said young parishioners think the church 
hasnt paid a lot of attention to them 
mccready a scheduled speaker at the conference said the bottom 
line is that young people tend to shy away from organized 
religion 
he said 25 percent of americans are catholics between 55 
million and 70 million people with probably half of those being 
active members 
the fundamentalist churches have drawn some young people but 
nowhere near what the catholic church has lost most of them are 
just sitting on the sidelines said mccready who is not a 
catholic 
the conference defined a baby boomer as 25 to 45 years old but 
mccready said the term more accurately applies to people between 30 
and 45 the baby boom was the great increase in the us birthrate 
in the years after world war ii 
henderson a committee member said priests in short supply 
are so busy they sometimes dont pay enough attention to young 
adults 
somehow were not making that linkage between the gospel 
message and what young people are looking for a sense of 
direction said henderson 37 
he said church leaders had been advised that young adults do 
not always feel welcome in parishes or in their churches and they 
think activities too often are aimed at older adults 
in the past churches were the main place to socialize on 
sundays but fontana noted that different activities dominate an 
increasingly secular united states 
there is more competition for time he said there are 
health clubs there are shopping malls open on sunday 
the church and youth leaders gathering in chicago from around 
the country dont expect to solve the problem at the conference

members in the past seven years its members are predominantly 
between 22 and 40

anglican church envoy terry waite and 
other western hostages in lebanon might be released next week the 
nations leading newspaper said today 
the respected annahar attributed the frontpage report to 
unidentified sources it did not say how many hostages may be freed 
and mentioned only waite by name 
the report said iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati is 
to visit the syrian capital of damascus in the next two days for 
consultations with the syrian command of president hafez assad 
velayati the sources said also might travel to beirut for 
talks with president elias hrawi and other lebanese officials 
syria with 40000 peacekeeping troops deployed in predominantly 
moslem lebanese regions since 1976 is the main power broker in 
lebanon 
iran is the main backer of hezbollah or party of god the 
shiite moslem umbrella for underground factions holding most of the 
13 western captives missing in lebanon including four britons 
the release of a number of foreign hostages held in lebanon 
topped by anglican church envoy terry waite is possible next 
week annahar quoted the informed sources as saying it did not 
elaborate 
annahar has proved reliable in the past in its reports on the 
hostages 
the story contained only a oneparagraph reference to the 
hostage issue it also said velayati was to work out with syrian 
and lebanese leaders a settlement to the 3yearold bloody power 
struggle between hezbollah and the mainstream shiite amal militia 
which has killed more than 1000 people 
hussein musawi the shiite mentor of some hostageholding 
factions said sept 29 that the four british hostages would 
benefit from the recently restored diplomatic ties between britain 
and tehran 
however musawi said the six american captives were not expected 
to be released soon due to the american military deployment in the 
gulf region following iraqi president saddam husseins aug 2 
invasion of kuwait 
the other western captives are two west germans and an italian 
there has been a flurry of reports about the possible release of 
british hostages since britain and iran restored ties after a 
rupture of 18 months over british author salman rushdies novel 
the satanic verses moslems say the novel is blasphemous 
improving relations and the new british conduct toward iran 
would serve british interests in general including the british 
hostages said musawi whose islamic amal movement is part of the 
hezbollah umbrella 
waite 51 a personal emissary of archbishop of canterbury 
robert runcie disappeared jan 20 1987 after leaving his hotel 
in moslem west beirut for a meeting with islamic jihad or islamic 
holy war the group is believed to hold american hostages terry 
anderson and thomas sutherland 
no group has claimed responsibility for waites abduction but 
former irish hostage brian keenan released in august said he was 
held with the anglican envoy for a while in the same house 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longest held among the 13 western captives in 
lebanon anderson 42 was kidnapped march 16 1985

the security council has approved un 
monitors for haitis elections and france pledged 2 million to 
help organize the voting 
the security councils action came friday in a letter to un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar approving his plan to 
help the caribbean nation with its dec 16 elections 
the un general assembly is expected to give final approval 
monday 
haiti is struggling to introduce democratic government the 
impoverished country which declared independence from france in 
1804 has been ruled by military force during most of its history 
the last attempt at free elections collapsed in 1987 when thugs 
backed by the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters 
in recent months former members of the security service of 
ousted dictator jeanclaude duvalier have returned to haiti many 
haitians worry they will interfere in the elections 
perez de cuellar has indicated he will send 87 staff members 80 
election monitors and 150 military personnel at a cost of about 10 
million 
haitian president ertha pascaltrouillot opposes the presence of 
armed personnel however 
diplomats say most haitians consider armed security men as 
oppressors after three decades of dictatorship by the duvalier 
family 
on thursday haitis electoral council signed an agreement with 
the organization of american states for about 25 oas poll watchers 
to monitor the campaign and election 
another team of election observers will be led by former 
president jimmy carter 
the request for un observers touched off a battle in the 
security council between the united states and a coalition of cuba 
china and colombia 
the united states backed the plan the other three nations 
contended that there was no threat to international peace posed by 
the haitian situation and that the council therefore had no 
jurisdiction 
in announcing its electoral aid the french embassy in haiti 
said friday that france was contributing the 2 million to support 
a civic education campaign and the printing of ballots 
the united states has pledged 64 million in electoral 
assistance

sudan has lifted its ban on un emergency 
relief flights to the rebelheld south where a drought could kill 
up to 1 million people officials of the world body said 
in meetings this week un secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar talked with sudans military ruler lt gen omar hassan 
elbashir about relief flights a un statement said friday 
last weekend the sudanese government banned red cross and un 
relief flights to the south where the sudan peoples liberation 
army holds almost all of the three regions 
the secretarygeneral expressed concern over the continued 
intensified fighting in the southern region including air attacks 
which had severely impeded relief efforts the un statement 
said 
at a followup meeting between sudans delegation and abdulrahim 
farah a un undersecretarygeneral foreign minister ali sahloul 
of sudan announced that the mercy flights could resume in his east 
african nation 
elbashir earlier announced a ceasefire with the southern 
rebels until the end of the year so children there can be 
vaccinated he said it could lead to a ceasefire 
elbashir said he had not received a reply from the rebels 
despite the progress relief officials say famine threatens much 
of sudan which has 25 million people they also say western donor 
governments have not responded to calls by relief agencies for 
help 
i think we have the makings of a major humanitarian disaster 
a bombshell disaster that hasnt caught the attention of the 
world said richard reid unicefs regional director for the 
middle east and north africa 
the advancing drought is worse than the one that killed more 
than 250000 in 1988 he said 
it is probable that unless there is focused and solid and 
rapid intervention we could lose at least 250000 and it could go 
up to the estimated 1 million that died in 1984 he said 
last year operation lifeline sudan with unicef as the lead 
agency saved more than 200000 lives when a similar drought 
gripped sudan but this year few donor countries have been offering 
help 
last year unicef collected about 67 million for the relief 
campaign 
this year we have received practically nothing less than 5 
million reid said 
frankly there is up to now on the part of everyone involved 
in addressing this humanitarian need a hesitancy a semiparalysis 
a disarray and a lack of focus we certainly hope that will 
change he said 
diplomats said privately that distaste for elbashirs military 
junta which seized power from the elected government of sadek 
elmahdi last year is a major reason that donations have dried up 
elbashirs regime dominated by arabdescended moslems has 
been fighting the ethnically african christian and animist rebels 
since 1983 the rebels have demanded more autonomy and an end to 
islamic law 
last year the rebels and government suspended fighting along 
relief corridors to let more than 100000 tons of food and other 
supplies be distributed

searchers equipped with 
sophisticated radar sonar and cameras will be probing loch ness 
beginning today in a twoday hunt for its legendary monster and a 
prize of nearly 480000 
it is the first major search for nessie as the fabled beast is 
known in three years 
the william hill organization ltd national oddsmakers have 
offered 477500 to the first person or team to discover conclusive 
evidence of the creatures existence 
a much smaller prize of 2865 will go to the team or individual 
judged to have the best search method 
four separate groups are taking part in the search which is 
based at the village of drumnadrochit near the northern shore of 
the scottish highlands lake they range from serious contestants to 
publicity seekers 
iain bishop deputy keeper of the zoology department of the 
natural history museum in london will examine any evidence found 
on behalf of the oddsmakers they stand to earn through bets placed 
on nessies existence stimulated by publicity surrounding the 
search 
andy gray 38yearold managing director of a scottish company 
called oceanscan that supplies underwater sonar equipment for the 
north sea oil industry heads one team 
he said its members are confident that if there is anything to 
find they will find it with their advanced underwater radar 
loch ness is 754 feet deep 23 miles long and a mile wide 
a second group that calls itself the rovers said it was using 
remotecontrolled underwater vehicles fitted with cameras to try to 
track the monster 
londoner daniel isted 25yearold editor of a corporate 
inhouse magazine said he will use what he called crystal 
divination suspending a crystal over the inky waters from a 
yacht to try to find the beast he said the crystal swings to 
indicate direction 
former rock singer screaming lord sutch who as head of the 
monster raving loony party has unsuccessfully run for parliament 
said he too is hunting nessie 
skeptical locals who have seen it all before looked on friday 
as the teams gathered television crews from the united states 
japan france britain and elsewhere filmed the scene 
the last big hunt for the loch ness monster was in october 1987 
when operation deepscan searchers with sonars reported detecting a 
large fishlike arch at a depth of 450 feet at the southern end 
of the lake 
at the time deepscan spokesman guy pearse said the object 
registered a clear large blip on the sonar but it was gone when 
the boat scanned the area again 
the legend of the loch ness monster dates from 565 ad when st 
columba who converted scotland to christianity castigated the 
creature for attacking a follower 
in modern times there have been more than 4000 reported 
sightings of the monster skeptics have explained them away as 
everything from waves logs and rotting vegetation to otters 
swimming deer and overindulgence in scottish whisky

unidentified assailants hurled 
a grenade and fired shots today at the home of relatives of nelson 
mandela killing a baby girl and injuring her parents police said 
african national congress officials said the dead child and her 
parents were distant cousins of nelson mandela they denied south 
african police and press reports that the child was mandelas 
greatgranddaughter 
police said they did not know who was responsible for the 
attack no group took immediate responsibility 
police lt govindesamy mariemuthoo said the attack occurred 
before dawn at the home of monde mandela in the black township of 
soweto the blast badly damaged part of the house knocking holes 
in the wall and causing extensive damage 
the police officer said a baby girl was killed and her parents 
injured he gave no other detail on the victims

mandelas father making her a distant cousin of nelson mandela 
the dead girls father monde mandela runs a small grocery shop 
the anc officials said nelson mandela was close to the monde 
mandela family 
an anc statement said the anc notes the curious coincidence 
of an attack on a man bearing the mandela name at this time 
given the distant connection between mandela and the family 
police said they did not know if the attack was deliberate or just 
a random attack linked to the general violence 
mandela was reportedly attending a political meeting in the 
eastern province of natal today 
soweto and other black townships around johannesburg have been 
hit by black factional fighting that has killed about 800 people 
since august the fighting has pitted followers of the anc against 
zulus of the conservative inkatha group 
mandela has repeatedly accused security forces of manipulating 
the violence to derail government efforts to end apartheid and 
share power with the black majority the police have denied 
mandelas charges 
mandela was released in february after 27 years in jail for 
opposing the white minority government he is closely guarded by 
anc operatives and there have been reports of threats on his life 
in recent months

a tropical storm today as it churned toward the virgin islands 
after leaving at least six dead and 1500 homeless from flooding in 
martinique 
klaus winds decreased from 75 mph to 70 mph early today and the 
national weather service in miami said some further decrease in 
strength was possible over the next 24 hours 
the storm skirted antigua on friday tearing roofs from houses 
but causing no major damage then continued its trek up the 
northeastern caribbean island chain the heaviest rain was falling 
just offshore the weather service said 
hurricane warnings were changed to tropical storm advisories for 
the northern leeward chain and british and us virgin islands 
the miami weather service said 
in san juan the national weather service said klaus would 
probably be centered 170 miles northeast of st thomas in the us 
virgin islands by this afternoon a weather bulletin warned 
residents to take necessary precautions for the protection of 
life and property 
on its present course klaus would stay to the east of the 
virgin islands and puerto rico the weather service said but 
added there is some uncertainty in its projected movement at the 
current time 
it was not known whether the storm would reach the continental 
united states 
klaus was upgraded from a tropical storm friday tropical storms 
become hurricanes when winds reach a sustained speed of 74 mph 
klaus is the 11th named storm and the sixth hurricane of the 
atlantic hurricane season

and longitude 622 west or about 60 miles eastnortheast of saint 
martin according to the weather service tropical stormforce 
winds extended 115 miles east and 40 miles west of the center 
forecasters said the system was drifting northwest at 6 mph

was expected to continue in the same direction today the miami 
weather service said 
antigua a popular tourist resort 250 miles southeast of puerto 
rico was buffeted by high winds and intermittent rain on friday 
zinc roofs were ripped from a few houses but there were no 
reports of serious damage or injuries said stan cieniewicz 
administrative officer for the antiguabaed pancaribbean disaster 
preparedness and prevention project 
it was practically nothing at all he said 
on dutch st maarten traffic jams built up in the capital 
philipsburg and long lines formed outside grocery and hardware 
stores as residents stocked up on supplies schools were closed 
and many people stayed home to board up windows 
in anguilla a tiny british colony of 7500 gov brian canty 
said the island began hurricane preparations thursday 
all government offices are now battened down and we have put 
our emergency plan into effect he said insofar as it is 
possible to work normally with all our hurricane shutters up it 
is business as usual 
as of today the french island of martinique south of the 
leewards was by far the hardest hit by the storm heavy rain since 
tuesday spawned landslides and serious flooding blocking many 
roads and forcing 1500 people from their homes

discovery thundered into orbit today 
with five astronauts and a nuclearpowered sun probe ending the 
shuttle fleets secondlongest grounding ever and boosting nasas 
battered credibility 
the 100ton spaceship rode a 700footpillar of flame at 747 
am edt through a thin bank of clouds and then into a sky flushed 
by a rising sun 
the liftoff was 12 minutes late because of showers near a 
shuttle emergency landing runway at the kennedy space center and a 
momentary technical glitch 
discovery began nasas 36th shuttle flight and the first in 5 
months the probe tucked inside its cargo bay was to be sent on a 
186 billionmile journey to study the suns unexplored poles 
two minutes into the flight the two solid fuel rockets burned 
out and dropped into the atlantic ocean discovery continued upward 
on the thrust of its three main liquid fuel engines reaching a 
184milehigh orbit 6 minutes later 
it was just a fantastic sight to see this thing go said ed 
massey a project administrator for nasa we think its 
fantastic and its also a great plus to the nation that the 
shuttle fleet is up and flying again 
after 18 years you cant help but feel good said scientist 
edgar page who started working on the project in 1972 for the 
european space agency 
nasa had been counting on a successful flight to help boost its 
image battered this year by a string of failed launch attempts 
the hubble space telescopes flawed mirror and this weeks accident 
involving another shuttle atlantis 
workers forgot to remove a 9footlong beam from atlantis and 
the metal piece banged around the orbiter as it was being lifted 
into an upright position 
launch director bob sieck said he did not know whether to 
describe the teams mood today as one of euphoria or relief 
sieck said the team was confident heading into liftoff in 
spite of the distractions and the disappointments that have 
occurred recently which would tend to overshadow a lot of good 
work thats been put in to get ready for this mission 
the team worked real hard for this sieck said they earned 
it they got their reward finally 
the major hurdle to launch fueling went smoothly no 
dangerous leaks were detected as more than 500000 gallons of 
liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen gushed into the shuttles 
external tank earlier today 
nasas two other space shuttles columbia and atlantis sprouted 
hydrogen leaks during fueling and had to be returned to the hangar 
for repairs discovery was the last shuttle to fly in april and 
is the only craft in which hydrogen leaks were not found 
the longest shuttlefleet grounding was 2 years after 
challenger exploded shortly after liftoff in january 1986 killing 
all seven crew members discovery also was the first shuttle to fly 
after that hiatus launching a successful mission in september 
1988 
the latest discovery mission isnt being affected by a shutdown 
of government agencies because of the dispute over the federal 
budget kennedy space center spokesman dick young said funds for 
the mission already had been set aside 
a federal judge in washington also sided with nasa on friday in 
denying a request by environmentalists to delay the mission for 
safety reasons 
the solar probe ulysses contains nearly 237 pounds of 
radioactive plutonium238 it will provide electricity for the 
807pound satellite during its fiveyear 750 million mission to 
study the suns poles 
ulysses would be the first spacecraft to orbit over the suns 
polar regions all previous craft circled over the equator 
nasas chief scientist lennard fisk said he expects ulysses to 
revolutionize our knowledge of the sun and the region of space 
that surrounds it the european space agency satellite has been 
waiting to be carried aloft since 1983 
about six hours after liftoff discoverys crew commanded by 
veteran astronaut dick richards was to send the spacecraft 
hurtling toward the planet jupiter at a speed of 34450 mph making 
it the fastest manmade object in relation to earth 
the crew was given the goahead two hours into the flight to 
begin reparing for ulysses deployment 
while swinging around jupiter ulysses will receive a gravity 
assist that will slingshot it toward the sun the satellite is 
expected to pass over the suns south pole in 1994 and the north 
pole in 1995 
the rest of the fourday mission involves experiments including 
one in which a fire would be started in a sealed chamber in an 
effort to improve safety on future flights 
in addition to richards the crew consists of pilot robert 
cabana and mission specialists william shepherd bruce melnick and 
thomas akers

todays launch of the ulysses spacecraft 
aboard the shuttle discovery delighted european and nasa officials 
whose agencies began discussing the solar exploration mission 18 
years ago 
everybodys absolutely elated said willis meeks nasas 
ulysses project manager at the jet propulsion laboratory which 
will serve as mission control for the sunorbiting spacecraft 
before todays launch i was waiting for the nerves to come 
meeks said a couple of minutes after liftoff my body went crazy 
for five seconds 
ulysses which will orbit the suns poles in 1994 and 1995 rode 
into earth orbit as space shuttle discovery was launched from cape 
canaveral fla it was to be deployed from the shuttle later today 
the 750 million mission is a joint project of the national 
aeronautics and space administration and the european space agency 
the europeans will control ulysses from nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory while nasa officials will provide tracking and other 
ground support nasas johnson space center in texas serves as 
mission control for the shuttle flight 
about 50 esa and nasa engineers and scientists in the jet 
propulsion laboratorys mission support area broke into applause 
and shook hands with each other as discovery lifted off another 50 
vips watched the launch on closedcircuit television from the 
laboratorys auditorium 
we are very pleased this was such a wonderful launch said 
willy brado esas assistant director of operations now an 
exciting and very interesting mission can begin 
meeks said the idea for a mission to explore the suns polar 
regions was devised in 1959 by john simpson at the university of 
chicago discussions between nasa and esa started in 1972 said 
edgar page ulysses science coordinator for the european agency 
the launch of twin spacecraft first was planned for 1983 then 
rescheduled for 1985 in 1981 nasas budget woes reduced the 
mission to a single satellite due for launch in may 1986 the jan 
28 1986 explosion that destroyed the shuttle challenger forced 
another delay 
we had a lot of hiccups over the years page said adding 
that finally seeing ulysses in space means you cant help but 
feel good 
ive been waiting for this since the early 1970s said bruce 
goldstein nasas deputy project scientist for ulysses its been 
a long time 
brado said the launch will help restore the confidence of 
european governments in manned space flights for launching 
scientific spacecraft 
i have to congratulate nasa on this very successful and very 
impressive launch brado said if this had failed it would 
have had repercussions at esa 
meeks added im feeling really great we needed this one

iraq told un members that the united 
states and its allies were trying to control the worlds oil 
reserves but the us ambassador dismissed the charges as lies 
other nations including the soviet union joined the angry 
replies to iraqs latest accusations made in a speech at the 
united nations on friday saudi arabias ambassador said iraq had 
committed an unforgivable crime a crime to shine in the history 
of crimes by invading kuwait on aug 2 
saudi arabia meanwhile has recalled its ambassador to jordan 
diplomatic sources said today in another indication of souring 
relations between the arab neighbors over the persian gulf crisis 
jordan has shown proiraqi sympathies 
the sources who spoke on condition of anonymity had no 
information on the reasons that precipitated the saudi decision 
the recall of ambassador mohammed alfahd alisa is tantamount to a 
freeze of relations between the two kingdoms 
in washington there was renewed concern over iraqs military 
potential five senators called for a pentagon study of how iraq 
might have gained technology to make socalled fuelair explosives 
the bombs have 10 times the power of conventional explosives 
without the fallout of nuclear weapons military officials say the 
united states has no ready defense against the explosives which 
could devastate oil fields air bases and troops the los angeles 
times newspaper reported friday 
in a prepared speech to the un general assembly iraqi foreign 
minister tariq aziz accused the united states and its allies of 
bringing the entire world to the brink of a devastating war in 
a quest to control the middle easts oil 
he said the united states and its friends are seeking to gain 
control over the oil reserves in the gulf so as to have a free hand 
in manipulating the needs of the world and especially the needs of 
the peoples of the third world for this important commodity 
aziz said the un security council was hypocritical when it 
penalized iraq for its invasion of kuwait while allowing israel to 
continue occupying arab lands seized in wars in 1967 and 1973 
in the speech read by an iraqi envoy sabah talat kadrat aziz 
said all middle east problems palestine lebanon the gulf and 
others should be considered on the same basis 
aziz did not come to new york to deliver it because the united 
states denied landing rights for the iraqi delegations plane 
kadrat and the iraqi delegation left the hall when a kuwaiti 
delegate d razzooqi replied that there are no falsifications 
of facts similar to what we have heard from the representative of 
dictator saddam hussein 
us ambassador thomas r pickering called iraqs address an 
insult to the iraqi people who deserve to be told no more lies 
soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky rebuked iraq 
saying we cannot but feel some satisfaction at the unprecedented 
unity in the security council 
the united states and other nations have sent tens of thousands 
of troops and scores of warships to the gulf region in a bid to 
force iraq to withdraw from kuwait the united nations has imposed 
air and sea embargoes on baghdad and said force may be used to 
uphold it 
in other developments 
in cairo a state newspaper said today that authorities have 
arrested 30 arabs 23 palestinians and seven iraqis sent by iraq 
to attack city squares tourist attractions and other targets to 
create disorder 
also in cairo the plos chief representative in egypt today 
urged palestinians living here not to be drawn into actions aimed 
at destabilizing egypts security 
in london the foreign office said today a 46yearold british 
man has died in kuwait after suffering an undisclosed illness the 
man william norrie atack a scottish scientist had worked in 
kuwait for eight years as a scientific officer at the ministry of 
public health his family said 
the british foreign office also said that two of the four 
british embassy staff in kuwait left today for baghdad britain 
made the decision to withdraw the two men last month to leave more 
supplies for the two remaining 
an aide to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev left iraq 
today after meeting with saddam a day earlier he reportedly 
carried a message to saddam from the soviet leader its contents 
were not disclosed

soweto the attack killed gloria mandela 1 and injured her 
parents monde 43 and susan 29 police said

police said they did not know if the attack was deliberate or a 
random incident linked to the chronic violence in soweto and other 
townships 
anc officials said nelson mandela is close to the monde mandela 
family who are distant cousins they said nelson mandelas father 
was the brother of monde mandelas grandfather 
the blast and ensuing fire badly damaged half the house one 
room was destroyed with the roof collapsed and charred debris 
strewn throughout the body of a badly burned dog lay inside 
monde mandela who runs a small grocery store and his wife were 
hospitalized with serious burns police said 
nelson mandela has led the anc since his february release from 
27 years in prison for trying to overthrow the whiteled

five years ago italy had its hands on mohammed 
abbas but let him go 
now the man convicted of masterminding the hijacking of the 
cruise ship achille lauro is back in the headlines and threatening 
new attacks on western interests 
the baghdadbased palestinian guerrilla leader also known as 
abul abbas has warned he will attack us aircraft if iraqi planes 
are hit during attempts to enforce the un air embargo against 
iraq 
the hint of possible bombings or hijackings have raised the 
specter of a new wave of terrorism in the mediterranean area which 
was bloodied by terrorist atrocities in the mid1980s 
one of the most daring assaults of that time was the hijacking 
of the achille lauro as it steamed off the coast of egypt on oct 
7 1985 with 511 passengers aboard on a cruise that began in 
genoa 
a wheelchairbound american passenger leon klinghoffer was 
killed by the hijackers who dumped his body overboard american 
attempts to bring abbas to justice led to severe strains in 
usitalian relations 
the ship was hijacked by four young men belonging to an 
extremist plo splinter group headed by abbas called the palestine 
liberation front they demanded that israel release 50 imprisoned 
palestinians 
the hijacking ended oct 9 after egypt negotiated with the 
hijackers abbas who was involved in negotiating the surrender 
and the four hijackers were flown out of egypt on an egyptian jet 
that was intercepted by american fighters and forced to land in 
sicily 
tensions arose as soon as the plane landed armed us and 
italian soldiers faced off each side demanding custody of the 
hijackers the situation was only resolved after feverish telephone 
calls between premier bettino craxi and president reagan 
the italians took custody of the four and promised to try them 
but refused to detain abbas saying the evidence compiled by 
washington was insufficient and that he held an iraqi diplomatic 
passport within two days he was slipped out of the country 
in an elaborate ruse abbas was kept aboard the egyptian plane 
and flown from one rome airport to another to board a yugoslav 
airlines commercial flight to belgrade craxis office later said 
the mode of departure was arranged at the request of egypt to 
prevent another interception by the americans 
but two weeks later italian magistrates filed charges against 
abbas and issued an arrest warrant 
in june 1986 he was tried in abstentia convicted and sentenced 
to life imprisonment for masterminding the hijacking the sentence 
was upheld on appeal 
the italians still have warrants outstanding for abbas arrest 
but in january 1988 the us justice department withdrew its 
warrant to the dismay of the klinghoffer family 
his dauhters said abbas should be held accountable in us 
courts the justice department said it acted after a review of the 
case and abbas conviction and sentence by an italian court 
at the trial in genoa prosecutors charged that the hijackers 
shot klinghoffer in the head and chest after syria refused a 
request to help arrange negotiations for the palestinians held by 
israel they said the hijackers planned to kill american and 
british passengers one every five minutes unless the prisoners 
were freed 
but the prosecutors insisted they developed the case in the days 
following abbas departure the government vigorously denied it had 
been soft on terrorism or had struck some deal with the plo 
in recent interviews at his heavily guarded office in baghdad 
abbas was unrepentant about the killing of klinghoffer 
can you name one palestinian killed by the israelis he 
demanded of a newsweek correspondent when questioned about the 
death of the 69yearold american 
he repeated his contention that the hijackers real intention 
was to launch a raid in ashdod the israeli port that was the 
ships next stop after port said egypt 
abbas latest threats come amid other recent warnings from 
palestinian groups threatening retaliation for any harm that comes 
to iraq 
in the days since iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait italy for 
one has taken seriously the possibility of new terrorist attacks 
italian officials decline to give details but security has been 
increased on roads leading to the main rome airport and extra 
guards have been posted outside government buildings us 
installations embassies and other possible targets

goodbye east germany hello headaches huge 
expenses and probably higher taxes 
first that wall in the mind must be broken through as 
germany perfects its union then there is the problem of how to 
play a greater international role without frightening the 
neighbors 
two recent announcements foreshadow what awaits nowdissolved 
east germany economically an enormous investment to modernize 
telecommunications but no help for a camera company that employs 
thousands 
jobs will be created by the telecommunications project but 
gradually over seven years 
pentacon the camera company in dresden will close throwing 
nearly 4000 people out of work it is the biggest business failure 
yet in the collapsing economy of what was an independent nation 
until midnight tuesday 
the holiday for unification was wednesday a day for prayers in 
ecumenical church services and thoughtful speeches by national 
leaders framed by the glorious music of germanys great composers 
on thursday it was back to business to news of burgeoning 
unemployment and the slow expensive process of dragging the 
formerly communist region up to national standards 
psychological problems accompany the economic more than 40 
years of stark political division created two kinds of germans 
it will take a long time to have one state with one people who 
really understand each other mayor walter momper said on the eve 
of unification of his nation and of berlin his city 
people in the east have less initiative than we have he 
said everything was determined by the party the bureaucracy and 
the government 
he said another major problem was the legacy of the stasi the 
defunct east german secret police its 6 million files are sealed 
their fate to be determined by parliament after national elections 
in december 
the poison is everywhere momper said of the stasi 
markus wolf the retired east german spymaster is reported to 
have fled to the soviet union his successor werner grossman was 
arrested wednesday in eastern berlin it may have been a holiday 
but prosecutors hunting east german spies did not take the day off 
chancellor helmut kohl used the occasion to tell other countries 
a united germany would strive for peace and never forget the harsh 
lessons of its nazi past 
mikhail s gorbachev announced plans to visit germany in 
november making him the first important foreign guest after 
unification and illustrating the swift improvement of relations 
with the soviet union 
a friendship treaty has been initialed and germans generally 
credit gorbachev with the collapse of east german communism 
germany has promised 95 billion to finance the withdrawal of the 
370000 soviet troops in former east germany by the end of 1994 
kohl has pledged that germany will strive for european unity 
without seeking domination sign a treaty with wary poland 
guaranteeing its border alter laws to permit german troops to 
serve on foreign peacekeeping missions and aid poor nations 
most germans foresee higher taxes but the government has said 
nothing definite kohl speaks of sacrifices ahead and 
estimates of the cost of rehabilitating eastern germanys five 
states range up to 12 trillion marks 775 billion over five 
years 
deutsche telekom a telecommunications arm of the 
governmentowned postal service said thursday it would invest 35 
billion over seven years to modernize the easts obsolete 
communications network 
managers from east and west were assembled in a chandeliered 
hall of a prussian palace on the unter den linden and given 
marching orders for the fused national telephone company 
several hundred phone workers from the east worried about their 
jobs demonstrated outside 
helmut ricke the telekom board chairman announced that most of 
the 40000 eastern employees would be retained but not all the 
old bosses will be bosses tomorrow he said pay would be raised 
gradually to the level of western employees 
political tests and unequal pay await people in the east 
we feel we will be secondclass citizens said klaus rieck 
of potsdam who like other east germans lived under dictators for 
nearly 60 years first adolf hitler and then the east german 
communists 
we were under pressure the whole time no freedom no freedom 
of speech or the press he said now the joy is great but the 
uncertainty is too 
uncertainty and bad news about jobs are daily fare 
treuhandanstalt the trustee agency trying to rescue formerly 
state eastern enterprises confirmed thursday that the pentacon 
camera company would shut by years end it advised the management 
to make its closing plans with social needs in mind 
fifteen regional managers have been chosen to decentralize the 
agencys efforts one of them peter langner said he would apply a 
mixture of us german and japanese managerial methods to help 
restructure about half of 600 to 1000 enterprises in leipzig 
langner a physicist said he helped found nicolet instrument a 
successful hightech company in madison wis in 1968 and worked 
as a director of the company in europe until 1981 
recently he has been a management consultant concentrating on 
east germanys infant businesses and believes the greatest 
difficulty is an unwillingness to take responsibility 
for 40 years you have a country which was never trained to 
make its own decisions he said everything was told to them 
the trustee agency needs to act more quickly he said because 
decisions are more important than right or wrong

the european communitys monetary 
committee today approved a british plan to tie the pound into 
europes exchange rate mechanism 
britains decision on friday reversed longstanding economic 
policy and appeared to signal the governments willingness to play 
an active role in efforts to shape an economic and monetary union 
of the community nations 
hans tietmeyer a member of the board of the german central 
bank said the monetary and finance officials agreed to the british 
proposal to peg the pound at 295 german marks in the exchange rate 
mechanism 
the pound will be allowed to swing up or down by 6 percent from 
that central rate for an unspecified transitional period he 
said the move is effective monday 
the decision was adopted unanimously by the committee of the 12 
nations of the european community trading bloc said michael 
somers a represenative of irelands treasury 
the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system 
seeks to prevent wide fluctuations in exchange rates and hold down 
inflation and interest rates 
with the pounds entry the currencies of 10 of the community 
nations will be tied to the arrangement only the portuguese escudo 
and the greek drachma are apart 
western european countries intend to create a vast common market 
without national barriers by 1993 they are also trying to form 
closer political ties 
the announcement friday by british chancellor of the exchequer 
john major was coupled with word that britains base interest rate 
will drop by one percentage point to 14 percent on monday 
the pound is joining the european exchange rate mechanism at a 
high level which the government hopes will ease britains 106 
percent inflation rate the countrys switch from a freefloating 
currency to a linked one is designed to promote economic stability 
by limiting disruptive exchange rate movements 
the pound and londons stock market rose sharply on the news 
because joining the mechanism would set a stable floor under the 
currency 
thatcher agreed in principle to link the pound to the other 
currencies at a community summit meeting in madrid last year but 
she said she would move only when britains inflation rate was 
lower to the european average of 55 percent 
britain decided to go ahead because britains doubledigit 
inflation is expected to decline prime minister margaret thatcher 
said 
the twin moves of entry into the 11yearold mechanism and the 
onepoint interest rate cut are right for the times the prime 
minister said friday 
opposition labor party leader neil kinnock said it was correct 
to cut interest rates and join the mechanism but that the moves 
were action of cornered government 
britain previously linked the pound to other currencies from 
1944 to 1971 under a system of fixed but adjustable exchange rates 
it then participated in a rate movementlimiting european snake 
until 1973 
the pound which has risen sharply in recent months on 
speculation that it would soon join the exchange rate mechanism 
soared to 19455 from 19185 before the announcement and to 
29933 marks from 29492 marks 
londons stock exchange extended trading for an hour because of 
the announcement the financial timesstock exchange 100share 
index closed friday at 21439 up 735 points or 36 percent 
from thursdays close

former president reagan is back on the gop 
campaign trail appearing at fundraisers from california to 
florida to raise millions of dollars for republican candidates 
the public relations fallout from the irancontra scandal a 
lucrative japanese tour and nancy reagans controversial book has 
done nothing to dampen the demand for reagan at luncheons cocktail 
parties and dinners 
a reagan appearance commands ticket prices of more than 1500 
rivaling the dollar drawing power of events featuring reagans 
successor president bush 
there is just a great deal of affection out there for this 
man said otto bos campaign director for california gop 
gubernatorial candidate pete wilson theres a recognition that 
youre looking at one of the great lions of the century 
wilson locked in a tight race with democrat dianne feinstein 
has benefited from five reagan appearances the most for any 
candidate reagan plans to attend two more wilson functions this 
month and more appearances are being considered 
but wilson isnt the only candidate reagan has been stumping 
for 
since february reagan has attended functions in oregon 
illinois georgia florida kentucky alabama and nevada and has 
appeared at los angelesarea events for candidates from iowa and 
idaho 
this month the former president is likely to make appearances 
for republican candidates in colorado indiana michigan and texas 
his office said 
president reagan is continuing a pattern that has been his for 
many many years said reagan spokesman mark weinberg he did 
not view the end of his presidency as retirement by any means 
reagan isnt commanding his 30000 or more speaking fee at 
party events but his partisan appearances sometimes come at cities 
where he also is delivering a moneymaking speech 
on thursday for example reagan popped into a 1000aperson 
cocktail party fundraiser for nevada gubernatorial candidate jim 
gallaway he also was delivering a speech to the mobil oil dealers 
convention at the adjacent las vegas convention center 
the california gubernatorial race viewed with strong interest 
by national republicans has been the focus of much of reagans 
political attention reagan a former california governor has 
appeared at events in los angeles beverly hills san diego fresno 
and san francisco 
the party wants to ensure it has a strong voice in 
reapportionment next year when the governor and 
democraticcontrolled legislature draw districts for the nations 
largest congressional delegation 
in addition to reagan the wilson campaign has featured stump 
appearances by bush vice president quayle and first lady barbara 
bush 
the gop strategy has been to lump reagans appearances for 
wilson in the beginning of the campaign and in the final stretch 
this was intended to give wilson who ran unopposed in the primary 
an early fundraising push then cash in on the late increase in 
voter interest 
whether its ronald reagan or arnold schwarzenegger no matter 
who the surrogate is taking them out to an event in the middle of 
july doesnt have the same kind of effect as later in the 
campaign said california gop spokesman dan schnur 
democrats cant really match the appearances by reagan and other 
heavy hitters 
i think reagans popularity rating is particularly high i 
dont think theyd be doing it if it wasnt said feinstein 
spokesman richard martin democrats dont have the big guns right 
now that the republicans do that definitely makes a difference

despite all the talk about an antiincumbent 
mood building among voters this election year nearly 80 house 
members and four senators are coasting to november with no major 
party opposition 
and those figures dont tell the full story of the diminishing 
level of competition for seats in congress 
half the 35 senators up for reelection are expected to 
overwhelm littleknown and underfinanced opponents 
of the 326 house members who have opponents 217 were described 
by common cause as financially unopposed the selfstyled 
citizens lobby said challengers to those 217 incumbents had raised 
less than 25000 each in campaign resources 
the associated press tally of house races found 61 incumbents 
with no opponents and 18 with only thirdparty opposition 
sens thad cochran rmiss david pryor dark and sam nunn 
dga have no opposition the only opponent on the ballot to sen 
john warner rva is a follower of political extremist lyndon 
larouche 
several explanations starting with the escalating cost of 
campaigns are offered for the decline in competition 
we didnt have the money in the state of georgia to finance a 
campaign against sam nunn said carl gillis republican national 
committeeman from georgia he estimated that a credible campaign 
against the senator who got 80 percent of the vote in 1984 and 83 
percent in 1978 would cost between 3 million and 4 million and 
still would be a long shot effort 
in virginia democratic gov l douglas wilder discouraged his 
party from challenging warner on the theory that it would be a 
waste of resources 
given the cost of mounting a campaign if you dont have a 
pretty good chance of winning why do it said political 
scientist gary jacobson an authority on congressional elections 
you see the reelection record of incumbents you see them 
use their resources so effectively and you hate to make a fool of 
yourself running and getting absolutely wiped out said tom mann 
a political scientist who heads the congress project at brookings 
institution 
mann suggested that the decline in competition did not signify a 
growth in the strength of political parties we have moved from 
safe party seats to safe incumbent seats said mann 
two of the senators and several house members without major 
party opposition are southern republicans a remarkable shift from 
the days when the democrats were dominant in the oneparty south 
in addition to cochran and warner republican sens phil gramm 
of texas and strom thurmond of south carolina are expected to win 
reelection by huge margins over democratic opponents 
in thurmonds case the lack of an opponent is all the more 
remarkable given that he will turn 88 in december the steady shift 
of south carolina to republicanism is demonstrated by the fact that 
gov carroll campbell also is favored to overwhelm his democratic 
opponent 
the southern habit of not contesting seats transferred to the 
republicans said jacobson 
the lack of competition for senate seats this year is not 
expected to be repeated in 1992 
this is a fairly entrenched group of senators up in 90 
said anita dunn spokeswoman for the democratic senatorial campaign 
committee i do not expect that in 1992 you will have a similar 
number of relatively uncontested seats despite the fact that 
everybody incumbents will be raising plenty of money for those 
seats 
of all the noncompetitive races none has provided more strange 
twists than the gop effort to challenge democratic gov mario cuomo 
of new york 
cuomo is a potential challenger to president bush in 1992 and 
republicans would have liked nothing better than to give him a hard 
time in his bid for a third fouryear term 
but challenging cuomo was a multimilliondollar task that no 
major party figure was willing to undertake 
enter economist pierre rinfret who had to admit he wasnt even 
certain he was a republican he got the nomination and then 
discovered it didnt come with enough money to run a credible 
campaign 
rinfret has since spent more time attacking republican leaders 
than tilting with cuomo 
they want me to lose because im going to upset their apple 
cart he said 
we understand the guys frustration said state gop chairman 
j patrick barrett but hes saying i need a million dollars 
and nobodys got the million dollars

fighting raged saturday in rwandas 
countryside between government troops and invading rebels and 
foreigners fled the capital of the central african nation by the 
hundreds 
no further fighting was reported in the rwandan capital of 
kigali where french foreign legionnaires and belgian paratroopers 
secured their embassies parts of the city the airport and its 
access highway 
but fierce clashes were reported in the northern part of the 
country and 500 soldiers from neighboring zaire arrived in kigali 
to reinforce the 5000strong rwandan army 
the rebels who call themselves the rwandese patriotic front 
invaded last sunday from rwandas northern neighbor uganda where 
they had been living in exilethey want to oust the government 
which they accuse of corruption 
many are deserters from the ugandan army and most are members of 
rwandas tutsi ethnic minority which was removed from power by the 
majority hutu tribe in the late 1950s and early 1960s in fighting 
that left tens of thousands dead 
their number has never been reliably estimated 
on saturday an air france boeing 747 carried 232 french and 
other european nationals to paris and another air france plane and 
a chartered lufthansa jet were expected to pick up about 500 more 
later in the day 
the soviet news agency tass said measures were being taken to 
ensure the safety and the evacuation of the families of soviet 
personnel it gave no further details and it was not known how 
many people were involved 
the german embassy in nairobi said the lufthansa plane would 
bring mostly wives and children of german aid workers out of 
kigali 
in brussels the belgian government said it was withdrawing its 
offer to place four c130 transport planes at the disposal of its 
allies in the persian gulf because of the fighting in rwanda 
belgium already has sent 500 paratroopers to rwanda to protect 
its 1630 citizens living in the former belgian protectorate 
foreign minister mark eyskens said in brussels friday that 
belgian citizens who wanted to leave rwanda could fly out on the 
same planes that brought in the 300 troopers 
although kigali appeared calm the british broadcasting 
corporations african service broadcast a message from the foreign 
office urging british citizens to stay indoors 
a dusktodawn curfew announced tuesday was extended round the 
clock and a belgian reporter in kigali said some people confined to 
their homes were running short of food 
rrance has 670 citizens in rwanda germany 400 and the united 
states 250 most are attached to embassies or engaged in foreign 
aid projects 
the exodus of foreigners was touched off by fighting in and 
around the capital early friday morning and fears that the conflict 
could degenerate into more serious interethnic violence 
diplomatic sources in kigali reported sporadic gunfire saturday 
but one said it appeared to be from nervous government soldiers 
one western diplomat said on condition of anonymity that belgian 
paratroopers were patrolling the capitals streets and guarding its 
main hotel the meridien where foreigners evacuated from the 
countryside were being housed 
both the belgian and french governments said their troops were 
sent to rwanda to protect their property and citizens and would not 
get involved in the fighting but the french army press service 
said the legionnaires were obliged to ripost fire defensively 
at armed elements friday morning 
rwandas president juvenal habyarimana said in a nationwide 
radio broadcast friday government forces were in full control 
but acknowledged that although the worst is over the fighting 
continues 
the rebels are led by maj gen fred rwigyema a seasoned 
ugandan army officer of rwandan descent they accuse president 
habyarimana of abuse of power and corruption and say they want to 
install a democratic government 
the rebels also say they would like to end the refugee problem 
there are more than 100000 rwandan refugees in africa and the 
guerrillas give an estimate of 1 million worldwide 
a main stumbling block to the refugees repatriation has been 
lack of space rwanda is africas most densely populated nation 
with an average of 566 people living per square mile

the federal government its coffers dry began 
shutting down nonessential services today closing the washington 
monument and other favorite tourist spots but maintaining the 
military and air traffic safety 
congressional leaders arrived for a midmorning meeting with 
president bush to discuss the budget crisis and found most of the 
white house dark 
visitors to the washington monument and national symbols in the 
nations capital were turned away 
tourists were turned away from the smithsonians museums and art 
galleries and the library of congress scheduled an early afternoon 
closing 
guards at the white house gates directed baffled tourists to the 
openair vietnam veterans memorial suggesting it was the only one 
of the dozens of governmentrun memorials and museums in the 
nations capital not locked up 
white house tours were suspended 
nonessential white house employes ranging from press 
information officers to cooks were told not to work along with 
weekend federal workers across the country 
the shutdown came at 1201 am saturday when the government 
lost its authority to spend money 
these were the early casualties of a government shutdown that 
could become devastatingly disruptive by tuesday after the 
threeday columbus day weekend if the budget impasse between 
congress and the white house isnt broken 
that deadlock deepened as bush said today he would veto a second 
stop gap measure to extend the federal governments financial life 
while negotiations continued 
no more business as usual said bush as he left the meeting 
with congressional leaders 
do not keep putting off the day of reckoning he warned 
congress 
an earlier continuing resolution had kept the government running 
since last sunday when congressional leaders and administration 
negotiators first reached a compromise 
but shutdown activities began after they failed to convince 
enough members of congress to go along with the compromise 
each agency decides what is an essential service but 
generally staying on the job will be workers dealing with national 
security health emergency and other essential services the 
military air traffic controllers border guards medical 
institution personnel and prison guards also would be unaffected 
nasas muchdelayed launch of the space shuttle discovery also 
took place despite the budget dispute officials at the national 
aeronautics and space administration said the mission was 
unaffected because the funds had already been set aside and 
if a budget agreement isnt reached by then all but 
essential employees among the 24millionmember federal work 
force will be told to go home within a few hours after reporting 
for work 
budget director richard darman on friday sent a memo to all 
agency heads telling them to be ready to send home workers 
scheduled to work today 
only essential employees generally those needed to protect 
life and property will be permitted to work during the shutdown 
darman said 
an hour before the disruption white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater told reporters at midnight tonight our national parks 
and monuments will close cleanup of hazardous waste sites will 
cease social security offices will accept no new applications 
border inspections will be delayed 
the government has shut down for lack of spending authority 
three times before in 1981 1984 and 1986 although never for more 
than a day 
the governments authority to spend money was to initially run 
out on oct 1 the start of the new fiscal year but president bush 
signed a stopgap fiveday extension to give congress a chance to 
begin working on a 500 billion fiveyear deficitreduction 
package he and congressional leaders crafted 
but the house rejected the plan early friday and bush refused to 
go along with another shortterm government spending bill 
the shutdown was hitting home at the white house where aides 
said daily public tours would be suspended 
deputy press secretary stephen hart said a scheduled monday 
reception in the east room for incoming supreme court justice david 
h souter would also be canceled and hart said he and other 
presidential spokesmen would be sent home 
manny strumpf national park service spokesman in new york city 
said the staffs at both liberty island and ellis island have been 
told to report to work but administration officials in washington 
said that they likely will be sent home in the absence of a budget 
deal 
the park service is prepared to padlock everything that can be 
padlocked said interior department spokesman bob walker 
if a visitor wants to drive into yellowstone or shenandoah 
park therell be no one there to keep them out or charge them a 
toll to get in but those people would be largely on their own 
walker said if their car broke down there would be no friendly 
ranger to help them 
a federal aviation administration spokesman bob buckhorn said 
that if we have a shutdown essential services remain in place 
including air traffic control however if the deadlock persists 
there would be a reduction in the number of controllers allowed to 
work 
at the agriculture department employees who normally work on 
weekends primarily forest service workers were told to be 
prepared to go home today 
kelly shipp a department spokeswoman said that only a handful 
of the 100000 usda employees nationwide would be considered 
essential and expected to report to work during a shutdown 
state and county offices of major usda agencies such as the 
farmers home administration and the agricultural stabilization and 
conservation service would close 
federal meat and poultry inspection however would continue 
during a general shutdown shipp said 
the defense department has more than 3 million employees 
including 21 million uniformed personnel but it appeared unlikely 
that any curtailment of pentagon operations would affect the 
deployment of more than 170000 servicemen and women in the persian 
gulf 
at the state department officials said all employees are 
expected to show up tuesday but that nonessential workers would be 
sent home 
the postal service is not affected because it is nt dependent 
on government appropriations and there was no immediate impact on 
amtrak although the passenger railroad receives a large government 
subsidy and its operations would be hard hit if the budget impasse 
is long lasting 
joan baran a spokeswoman for the us customs service in new 
york said customs agents are considered essential and would work 
this weekend 
everything will be business as usual she said 
if the president fails to sign a continuing resolution by 
tuesday then nonessential employees mostly clerical workers 
could be sent home baran said 
nobody likes to be told theyre nonessential she said

tacitly agreed not to press ahead with armed resistance against the 
iraqis to avoid massive reprisals 
saad described continuing human rights abuses and massive 
destruction by iraqis in kuwait he said many kuwaiti men have been 
taken to iraq some were killed and women and children have been

the damage is very much you cant believe it he said i 
feel very sad 
saad was asked about suggestions that iraqi leader saddam 
hussein might be prepared to withdraw from most of kuwait while 
holding onto an oilrich strip along the border and the islands of 
bubiyan and warbah which control iraqs outlets to the gulf 
we dont accept any sort of formula or suggestion less than 
the un security council resolutions which call for 
unconditional iraqi withdrawal and restoration of the royal 
alsabah family he said 
asked if kuwait would maintain that position if the crisis 
dragged on for months or years he said yes we would stick to 
it

senate to sustain it 
the house vote on the stopgap measure had been 300113 and the 
senate added voicevote approval 
bush said he thought a shortterm solution could emerge by later 
in the day and dole said bush was prepared to sign a spending bill

pouring rain and a thick mist 
saturday failed to dampen the enthusiasm of hunters hoping to win a 
halfmilliondollar reward in the first major search for the loch 
ness monster in three years 
but there was no immediate sign of the legendary beast 
national oddsmakers at the william hill organization ltd have 
put up the cash 250000 pounds or 477500 for the first 
person or team to discover conclusive evidence of the 
creatures existence 
based at the village of drumnadrochit near the northern shore of 
the loch or lake in the scottish highlands four groups are 
taking art in the twoday search they range from serious 
contestants to publicity seekers 
william hill has offered an additional 2865 prize for the best 
search method 
daniel isted the 25yearold londonbased editor of a corporate 
inhouse magazine said he was using what he called crystal 
divination he said a tourmaline crystal suspended from a yacht 
over the inky waters would swing to indicate nessies direction 
former rock singer screaming lord sutch head of a political 
group called the monster raving loony party said his secret weapon 
was a whistle that produces the mating call of monsters 
tongue in cheek he announced he would use haggis a scottish 
delicacy consisting of chopped entrails and oatmeal cooked in the 
lining of a sheeps stomach as bait to lure the creature to the 
surface 
the raving loony party created to poke fun at politicians runs 
candidates in most elections 
andy gray 38yearold managing director of a scottish company 
that supplies underwater sonar equipment for the north sea oil 
industry is taking a more scientific approach with a sophisticated 
underwater radar 
typically this system can work 3280 feet beneath the sea if 
nessie comes within our search scan we will find it 
loch ness is 754 feet deep 23 miles long and a mile wide 
iain bishop deputy keeper of the zoology department of the 
natural history museum in london will examine any evidence found 
on behalf of the oddsmakers 
standing in the pouring rain and looking out at the mistcovered 
lake he acknowledged some skepticism 
i dont expect to be overwhelmed by it evidence bishop 
said 
locals who have seen it all before picked their way through 
the army of news people and television crews from the united 
states japan france britain and elsewhere that have invaded the 
village 
the legend of the loch ness monster dates from ad 565 when st 
columba castigated the creature for attacking a follower 
in modern times there have been more than 4000 reported 
sightings including the october 1987 sighting that spawned the 
last major hunt 
that search operation deepscan used sonars and reported 
detecting what was called a large fishlike arch at a depth of 
450 feet on the southern end of the lake 
deepscan spokesman guy pearse said then the object registered as 
a clear large blip on the sonar but when the same boat scanned the 
area again the object had disappeared 
skeptics have explained away the sightings as everything from 
waves logs and rotting vegetation to otters swimming deer and 
overindulgence in scottish whisky 
a study by a scottish company mackay consultants printed in 
the times of london in may said the loch ness monster was worth 
47 million a year in tourist revenue and responsible for 2500 
tourist industry jobs 
it said half a million visitors a year from all over the world 
come to loch ness in hopes of seeing the fabled creature

investigators have begun examining 
documents in berlin that could be used as evidence against erich 
mielke the jailed chief of east germanys stasi secret police 
officials said saturday 
three days after the fanfare of unification the stasi legacy 
resurfaced as a serious and possibly troubling issue for the new 
german nation 
earlier saturday a newspaper reported that lawmakers from 
former west germany want to bar rrom a united parliament any 
newcomers from east germany who had stasi links 
in berlin protesters outside the former stasi headquarters were 
surprised late friday when strangers showed up and said they were 
from the bundeskriminalamt a sort of german fbi 
the protesters have been demanding that only citizens of former 
east germany have access to the highly sensitive files and 
immediately denounced the investigators actions 
rolf hannich spokesman for the federal prosecutors office in 
karlsruhe confirmed that investigators were at the complex to look 
for evidence 
but he insisted the action was not violating an agreement 
strictly limiting access to 6 million stasi files and keeping them 
under east german control 
he said investigators were examining documents that could be 
used against mielke and other former secret police officials 
those documents had been made available by east german officials 
before unification and the investigators wanted to have another 
look at them said hannich 
earlier the adn news agency said federal law officials plan to 
comb through the former stasi secret police headquarters in search 
of evidence 
mielke is suspected of harboring palestinian and leftist german 
terrorists and faces a host of other accusations as well 
federal law officials arent the only ones interested in whats 
inside the stasi files 
the newspaper bild am sonntag said western lawmakers want to 
have a look at the files after dec 2 elections to make sure 
parliamentary newcomers from the east arent tainted by a stasi 
past 
it quoted juergen ruettgers a top parliamentarian from 
chancellor helmut kohls coalition as saying without a doubt we 
will want to know after parliamentary elections whether new members 
were stasi workers 
the bundestag parliament must not be occupied by former 
spies wilfried penner a top social democrat was quoted as 
saying 
western lawmakers want to establish a committee that would 
investigate the pasts of new parliamentarians from the east the 
newspaper said in a telex sent to other news organizations in 
advance of sundays publication 
penner said such a committee should be permitted to examine the 
stasi files which are potentially explosive because of the damage 
they could do to political careers and to private lives if their 
contents were made public 
during one of the last sessions of the volkskammer east 
germanys parliament a number of members confessed they once had 
stasi links 
the stasi secret police snooped on all facets of east german 
life in order to maintain the communist rulers iron grip on the 
nowdissolved nation

young people set pools of gasoline ablaze in 
the street and hurled rocks at riot police in japans largest slum 
saturday night in demonstrations touched off by charges of police 
corruption 
huge piles of burned bicycles broken glass and hulks of 
burnedout cars littered the streets in the nishinari district of 
osaka the countrys no 2 city 
police said 171 people including 134 police have been injured 
in the violence since it began tuesday when a police sergeant was 
reported to have received bribes from gangsters active in the 
neighborhood fiftyseven people have been arrested they said 
the scope of the violence is extremely unusual for japan where 
public issues rarely inflame passions to such a degree 
about 2500 riot police in thick padded uniforms and blue 
helmets formed a barricade with metal shields near the nishinari 
police station to keep the crowd of about 1100 from approaching 
four vehicles equipped with water cannons guarded the stations 
main entrance and regularly sprayed the crowd every few minutes 
groups of young people dashed toward the riot police yelling 
insults and pounding the troopers with stones 
some poured pools of gasoline over the street and lit it but 
the blazes were quickly extinguished by the water cannons another 
group broke into a nearby hotel and attempted to set it on fire 
but that blaze also was put out by the water cannons 
after midnight the crowd began thinning police said 
i think the crowd is getting tired a police official said 
on condition of anonymity but we will continue to keep 2500 
riot police here just in case 
earlier last week after the arrest of a local policeman on 
suspicion of having taken 81000 in bribes from gangsters most 
people involved in the nightly violence were day laborers from the 
neighborhood 
news reports said the arrested policeman had confessed he 
accepted the bribes in exchange for providing information about 
police operations against the gangsters who control the allocation 
of some jobs to the day laborers and receive a percentage of their 
wages in return 
many in the crowd saturday were hooligans and students from 
outside the neighborhood police said 
the rioting has not spread beyond the neighborhood but has 
caused traffic tieups in parts of osaka as police blocked off 
several major streets 
the area nicknamed the airin district by locals is japans 
largest slum and is notorious for gangs transient laborers and 
shabby hotels 
local residents and human rights activists have complained about 
police anticrime measures including 24hour surveillance cameras 
on street corners 
menial laborers in the area have previously demonstrated against 
low wages and other issues but the level of last weeks violence 
was unusual

here is a transcript of president bushs press 
conference saturday with reporters in front of the white house 
president bush well i just want to comment i know the leaders 
have been speaking and i have not yet signed but within the next 
couple of minutes will veto the continuing resolution 
weve had good cooperation from democrat and republican leaders 
and the congress has got to get on with the peoples business and 
that id like them to do that business get a budget resolution 
and get it done in the next 24 hours or 48 hours 
but as president i cannot let the peoples business be 
postponed over and over again ive jotted down the numbers there 
have been three dozen in the last decade three dozen continuing 
resolutions business as usual and we cant have it and the 
president can only do this one thing send that message back and 
say this is not a time for business as usual the deficit is too 
important to the american people 
so i expressed my appreciation to the speaker the majority 
leader in the senate the majority leader in the house two 
republican leaders thanked them for coming together in a spirit of 
compromise to get an agreement that i strongly supported didnt 
have everything i wanted in there but now im calling on those who 
did not vote for it on the republican side and on the democratic 
side to get up with the leadership and send down something that 
will take care of the peoples business once and for all 
and i am sorry that i have to do this but i made very clear 
that i am not going to be a part of business as usual when we have 
one deficit after another piling up and ive had enough of it and 
i think the american people have had enough of it 
q mr president mr mitchell came out here just a minute ago 
and said that this serves no useful purpose the shutting what 
useful purpose 
a thats where we have a disagreement with him i think it 
serves i think it disciplines the united states congress 
democrats and republicans theyre the ones that have to pass this 
budget and they ought to get on with it and the leaders to their 
credit tried but a lot of members think they can get a free shot 
right and left 
and that what this message says is no more business as usual 
so we did have a difference on that particular point i think both 
the speaker and the majority leader did not want me to do this but 
look let me take you guys back awhile in august i wanted to keep 
the congress in that story was written and i listened to the 
leadership both republicans and democrats so i said no well 
acquiesce because they said to keep the congress here in august 
will be counterproductive everybody will be angry with you that 
the way to get it done is with the discipline of the calendar 
running after the summer recess 
and so i acquiesced i compromised i gave im not going to do 
it any more im very sorry if people are inconvenienced but i am 
not going to be a part of business as usual by the united states 
congress 
q mr president senator dole said that you had agreed to sign 
to send up a new shortterm spending bill that would include 
spending cuts a sequester could you tell us something about that 
a well im going to stay out of exactly what were going to do 
and let the leaders handle the details of this now its in the 
congress and we will strong i still strongly support the agreement 
that both democrat leaders and republicans leaders came down on 
and ill say this i do think that theres a lot of agreement 
goodwill still existing for that its not going to be passed 
exactly that way it was defeated but lets leave the details of 
negotiation on that to the congress theyre starting back in right 
now theyre going to have to contend with this veto i sent up and 
obviously i want to see that veto sustained

q you say no more business as usual in one breath you say no 
more crs continuing resolutions but in the next breath dole says 
youll sign a cr with a sequestration 
a well if the well if it has some discipline what im 
saying is i want to see this system disciplined if it has if it 
what bob dole said is correct ill sign one if it puts some 
discipline on the system and if it doesnt discipline the system 
then i stay with my current position no excuse me im glad you 
brought that up because i would strongly support that 
q the leadership made a strong point in saying that its the 
average americans who are going to be hurt federal workers and so 
on its not congressmen but you know average americans who are 
going to be strongly hurt by this 
a the average american is smart the average american knows 
whats going on i think and i think they know that the congress 
has continued to kick this can down the road and they think they 
ought to act and im very sorry for people that are inconvenienced 
by this or hurt by this but this is the only only device one has 
for making something happen and that is to get the congress to 
act to do its business 
q mr president you seem to be blaming congress but in fact a 
lot of their constituents are the ones that urged them to vote 
against it they say its unfair the burden is unfairly divided 
that the poor and the middle class are paying too much is it 
possible that maybe this program that you propose with the leaders 
just was not acceptable to the american public 
a well certainly certain aspects of it might well not have 
been acceptable to the american public on both the right or the 
left but when youre trying to do the countrys business ive 
discovered you have to compromise from time to time and thats 
exactly what i did took a few shots in the process but it doesnt 
matter what matters is lets move this process ahead now 
but yeah youre right some people didnt like one aspect or 
another we had republicans jumping up on the side of our side of 
the aisle and said well ill vote for it if you change this or 
i dont like this part of it but if you change that and 
similarly youve got people that you were quoting that were on the 
other side so but at times one has to come together to do the 
countrys business for the overall good and these outrageous 
deficits cannot be permitted to go on and on and on and on and 
im worried about international markets im worried about this 
country to be the opinion that it cant take care of its fiscal 
business 
and to their leaders credit democratic and republican they 
tried very hard and they failed to get a majority on the democratic 
side and the republican leaders with the help from this 
president all i could bring to bear on it we failed because we 
had people who were looking at one narrow part of the package and 
not at the overall good and i am hopeful now that with the 
urgency this veto brings to bear on the situation that reasonable 
people men and women in the congress can come together 
q mr president what kind of progress is being made on a new 
budget resolution and sources on the hill are saying that there 
is glowing support for raising the tax rates of the wealthy in 
exchange perhaps for the cuts on premiums for medicare but 
youve opposed that in the past are you willing to give on tax 
rates for the wealthy 
a i am i dont know the answer to your question theyre just 
going back up now to try i like the parameters of the other deal 
wherein i compromised weve got people your question reflects 
the views of those on the more liberal or left side of the 
political spectrum who raise those questions we have some on the 
right side of the political spectrum coming at the process from 
another way 
now i say let them go up and negotiate this is the business of 
the congress and our people will stay in touch i wont mislead 
them if theres something thats so outrageous i cant accept it 
ill let them know at the beginning so they dont waste their time 
but were flexible ive already compromised and im not saying 
that i cant take a look at new proposals but youve got to put 
together a majority in the congress and thats where the leaders 
are having great difficulties

gone with the wind with frankly my dear i dont give a 
damn 
such instances appear tame now compared with 2 live crews 
graphic raps on the album as nasty as they wanna be on such 
songs as me so horny the florida group describes exactly how 
they would mistreat women to satisfy their desires 
similarly one photograph in the late mapplethorpes exhibit 
showed one man urinating in another mans mouth three photos 
showed penetration of mans anus with various objects and two show 
children with their genitals exposed 
to some thats trash to others its art 
sophies choice author william styron calls the obscenity 
battle uncalledfor its a violent exhibition of the kind of 
puritanism that is still the governing spirit in many ways in this 
country 
i dont like anything that puts a damper on artistic 
expression 
but wildmon said the americans common sense is simply coming to 
the fore spurred by an outbreak of permissiveness in the arts 
eight or 10 years ago the average american was not confronted 
with this wildmon said more americans are being confronted 
with this and they dont like it more than that their children 
are being confronted with this and they dont like that 
inspired by the mapplethorpe trial the brooklyn museum in new 
york city has put together an exhibit showing several centuries of 
objectionable art the point is to show that whats considered art 
or obscenity frequently changes over the years said curator 
charlotte kotik 
among the artwork on display are rodins bronzes of lesbians 
embracing 19th century paintings of nude children and an 18th 
century hindu painting of a man urinating into another mans mouth 
like wildmon kotik can see the nations conservative drift over 
the last decade the difference is she disagrees with it and 
worries that more art might fall victim 
it starts with small things and can unfortunately turn into a 
big issue she said what we are trying to say is wait a 
minute stop and think about what we are doing before it goes too 
far 
2 live crews legal troubles are continuing even as their music 
may be becoming pass 
leader luther campbell and two other band members are to go on 
trial this week in miami on charges of performing obscene material 
at a nightclub the group also canceled shows on its current tour 
because of lagging ticket sales 
meantime along come the geto boys 
members of this texas rap group brag they make 2 live crew sound 
like choir boys they lace their sexually explicit raps with 
extreme violence and misogyny last month giant geffen records 
announced it would no longer distribute the geto boys record 
label def american 
im an editor of a rap music magazine and i have trouble with 
the geto boys said jon shecter editor of the source i 
support everyones right to say what they want but the geto boys 
are in another league 
shecter said such bands as the geto boys and others who send him 
clippings of their arrests seem interested in obscenity for the 
sake of attention not art 
florida lawyer jack thompson whos crusaded against 2 live 
crew warned the record industry in a pointed billboard essay that 
if they dont see that acts clean up their lyrics courts will do 
the job 
life imitates art and art imitates life thompson said we 
need to enforce laws against the people who are calculatingly going 
after the almighty dollar at the expense of women and children

a one followup and then well come over here 
q following up on that members of your own party dislike the 
deal so much how could you and your advisers have misjudged the 
sentiments of members of your own party 
a because its easy when you dont have to be responsible for 
something its easy to get up and say hey ive got an election 
in three weeks and im going to stay up against this particular 
package medicare the tax on the home heating oil or the fact 
theres not enough growth or not enough incentive any individual 
member can do that and maybe it plays well at home the president 
and the leadership in both houses have to be responsible for the 
overall good of the country have to make something happen 
i cant get it done just my way i dont control both houses of 
congress id love to think that that luxury would come my way 
someday but it hasnt and therefore weve had to compromise so i 
will keep trying in that spirit that cooperative positive spirit 
but when it comes to the discipline that comes from saying im 
sorry no more business as usual thats where i can stand up i 
dont need a consultation to do that and i get plenty of advice on 
one side of that question or the other but i am absolutely 
convinced this is right 
and even those who are inconvenienced by this are going to say 
thank god we get the american peoples business of getting this 
deficit under control done and thats my objective and i think 
every parent out there who sees his kids future being mortgaged by 
these outrageous deficits sees a shaky economy thats being 
affected by these prolonging these deliberations will be grateful 
in the long run in the meantime youve got to take a little heat 
q mr president the budget resolution that failed is one that 
you worked hard for despite the fact that you gave a nationally 
televised speech and despite the fact that youre popularity is 
very high you failed to sway even a majority of votes in your own 
party does that concern you and do you think this is a major 
setback for your presidency 
a no i dont think that at all but i do think yes it 
concerns me id like everybody to do it exactly the way i want 
but it doesnt work that way and so now we have to use a little 
discipline unintelligible nice guy stuff and well try this 
is a tough decision its not an easy decision ive made but it is 
the right decision so im disappointed they didnt do it my way 
but im in this im in here to do what is best for the country 
and what is best for the country is to get this deficit under 
control to get this economy moving again and to see people at jobs 
not out on some welfare line 
and thats whats at stake here the economic soundness of the 
united states and weve got a lot of things going on in the world 
and a strong economy is absolutely is vital to what i want to see 
achieved for this country so you have to take some hits i mean 
you dont get it done exactly your your own way but i read these 
speculative stories tomorrow theres going to be another vote 
tomorrow somebody else will move the previous question or second 
the motion or some committee chairman will jump up and say hey 
what about me my little empires being invaded here and ill 
say hey the presidents the guy that has to look at the overall 
picture i can understand congressmen doing that 
but we came together on a deal we worked for it everybody had 
a chance to posture that didnt like it they had no 
responsibility but i feel a certain responsibility to the american 
people to move something forward here so ive compromised now 
were going to say were going to try it this way no more 
business as usual do not just keep putting off the day of 
reckoning and i dont want to be a part of that and thats why 
ive had to veto this resolution

q mr president you talked a lot about discipline today do 
you think the american people on average are willing to accept the 
discipline of a tough budget agreement 
a thats a very good question and if you look at the vote in 
both in the house of representatives you might say no but i 
think in the final analysis the answer will be yes because i think 
the i think we sometimes underestimate the american the 
intelligence of the american people 
i can see where a congressman can jump up on a specific a 
specific spending program that will help him in his district or i 
can see when somebodyll give you the broad tax speech or some 
help him in his district but in the final analysis the what 
the american people look at is do we have an economy in which i 
can feed my family where i can have an opportunity to work for a 
living and where i can put a little aside to educate my kids and 
therein lies the problem because thats what were working for is 
were trying to get this federal deficit down 
but i think you raise a good point i think a lot of these 
congressmen can jump up without any responsibility for running the 
country or even cooperating with their leaders and make a point 
thats very happy for the home folks but i think you 
underestimate i think that view underestimates the overall 
intelligence of the american people whether conservative whether 
a guys working on a factory line some place whether hes an 
investor some place so thats why i think this is very important 
that the congress now finally come to grips with this excuse me 
ann 
q mr president it sounds like youre now saying hands off 
its up to the congressional leaders to do the negotiating 
a well they are theyve already started up the road there to 
go to congress and start negotiating but no weve made very 
clear that were continuing to help i dont want to mislead them 
there are certain things i can accept and certain things i cant 
so i think its very important that our able team in whom i have 
total confidence stay in touch with them but 
q but not sit at the negotiating table with them 
a oh i think theyll be there i think it all depends on what 
the forum is i think there is some feeling ann on the part of 
members both democrat and republicans hey you know you 
summiteers handled handed us a deal well what the heck i 
mean how do you expect to get to get as far along toward an 
agreement as we did get but what i want to do is facilitate it 
and if they want to know where the white house is fine if they 
want the ideas that that largely led to an agreement fine and i 
think they will but were not going to force our way in this is 
the business of the congress the american people know that they 
know that the president doesnt pass the budget and doesnt vote on 
all this stuff its the congress that does it 
q mr president 
a and so im not trying to assign blame im simply saying 
were available if we want to talk or in the way fine but 
were not i think both leaders in there indicated they wanted to 
stay in very close touch with the white house 
q is there any talk of a constitutional challenge to civiletti 
on the hill that that the attorney generals opinion is not 
sufficient to run the government and it violates article i 
section 7 of the constitution 
a havent heard anything about that doesnt worry me 
q mr president are you going to cancel your campaign schedule 
next week if this impasse is not resolved 
a i dont know ive got to cancel everything that has to do 
with government i guess but whether that maybe thats a good 
chance to get out there in the political process

the griefstricken royal family laid princess 
carolines husband stefano casiraghi to rest saturday in a plot 
overlooking the stretch of blue mediterranean where he was killed 
in a boatracing accident 
the private burial at the tiny chapel of the peace followed a 
public funeral at monacos nearby cathedral thousands of people 
including tourists in bright beach outfits and citizens in black 
mourning garb crowded around the 115yearold cathedral during the 
tearful ceremony 
the tiny wealthy riviera principality appeared sad but not 
stricken by the same shock that accompanied the death of carolines 
mother princess grace in a car accident in 1982 
gambling continued at the famed casinos without interruption 
small businesses closed during the funeral but quickly reopened for 
the afternoon 
casiraghi 30 an italian businessman died instantly wednesday 
when his boat flipped during the world offshore championships the 
somersault slammed him headfirst into the water the other driver 
patrice innocenti was injured 
the brutality of his death adds to our pain archbishop of 
monaco joseph sardou said at the service the sea so calm today 
holds dangers that must constantly be confronted 
princess caroline 33 wept occasionally during the 55minute 
service as sunlight streamed through stainedglass windows and a 
bach dirge wafted from the organ 
the princess wore dark sunglasses a blacklace headcovering 
and black dress the three children from her sevenyear marriage to 
casiraghi were not present 
referring to caroline sardou said it was through his union 
with you madame that he found the greatest expression of his 
christian faith 
caroline occasionally leaned on her father prince rainier for 
support prince albert heir to the realm comforted younger sister 
princess stephanie when she briefly fled the cathedral weeping 
only 1600 of the several thousand mourners who began lining up 
saturday morning fit inside the cathedral the rest remained 
outside under the warm october skies 
the mourners included danielle mitterrand wife of french 
president francois mitterrand actor alain delon exiled king 
michael of romania and fashion designer karl lagerfeld 
thousands of floral bouquets covered the cathedrals steps the 
brightly colored shorts and tshirs worn by tourists contrasted 
with stark black worn by monacos citizens 
oh dear stefano sobbed one elderly italian woman i was 
here for graces funeral and now im here to mourn young stefano 
there is a curse on the royal house 
a whiteuniformed fiveman honor guard wearing redtasseled 
hats stood stiffly at attention during the ceremony squads of 
police kept watch on the mourners outside 
as the service ended a weeping caroline walked out of the 
cathedral clinging to the arm of her whitehaired father 
the princess decided to bury her husband at the simple chapel 
over the objection of her inlaws who wanted him interred in 
italy french and italian newspapers reported 
other commoners who have married into the ruling grimaldi family 
are buried at the site including dancer john gilpin the late 
husband of rainiers sister antoinette 
princess grace the former hollywood star grace kelly is the

following seven years he became a prominent business leader here 
with major interests in real estate and development firms 
the couple had three children andrea 6 charlotte 4 and

the planned us buildup on the arabian 
peninsula is virtually complete but american forces still lack the 
firepower and supplies necessary to launch a successful ground 
offensive against iraqi troops in kuwait according to military 
officials 
the officials in washington and saudi arabia said all of the 
heavy armor being shipped to saudi arabia should arrive by weeks 
end closing out the biggest phase of the twomonth deployment and 
bringing to nearly 200000 the number of american troops in the 
region 
as evidence of the progress navy sources said that for the 
first time since the buildup began significant numbers of cargo 
ships are returning to the united states from the persian gulf 
without orders to quickly reload and head back 
one of these sources all of whom spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said at least 11 ships were heading home without new 
orders to pick up mideastbound cargo 
were about to pass the buildup phase and move into the 
sustainment phase the navy official said the heavy lifting is 
over 
discussion of us military options in the region has included 
speculation that the american mission might shift from the defense 
of saudi arabia to some offensive action against iraqi forces once 
the final us armored units arrived to support heavy ground forces 
already deployed in the northern saudi desert 
but as ships carrying those tanks armored vehicles and heavy 
artillery made their way to saudi arabia last week military 
officials were playing down the prospects for any offensive action 
indeed most of the officials said the us forces even with 
the final planned shipments of heavy armor still would be well 
short of the manpower and weapons capabilities needed to mount a 
successful assault on the more than 400000 iraqi troops in heavily 
fortified defensive positions in kuwait and southern iraq 
were in there for the long haul said a pentagon source 
we do not have enough firepower nor do we have a logistical tail 
in country to conduct an offensive campaign our plans dont 
ever foresee us reaching that point 
another pentagon official also speaking privately said 
administration officials at the white house or pentagon who were 
discussing possible offensive actions need to take a more sober 
perspective 
we can guarantee the defense of saudi arabia but going on 
offense thats wishful thinking this official said the 
enemy is digging in and digging in and digging in it would take a 
lot more than were planning on sending to move them out 
while some troops and equipment will be trickling into saudi 
arabia and other us positions in the region for as long as the 
deployment lasts pentagon planners will consider the buildup 
essentially completed when the final armored units en route take up 
positions in the saudi desert 
these include roughly 13500 troops from the 3rd armored cavalry 
regiment from fort bliss texas two brigades of the 1st cavalry 
division from fort hood texas and one brigade fro the 2nd 
armored division also from fort hood their equipment includes 
hundreds of m1 tanks and bradley armored infantry carriers 
as of friday all of the major equipment belonging to those 
units was in or close to saudi arabia with the exception of a 
shipment of antiaircraft guns scheduled to leave port in the 
united states within days according to pentagon sources 
to date 28074 reservists have been called to active duty said 
pentagon spokesman bill caldwell 
and pentagon spokesman pete williams said friday that the call 
up of reservists would remain within levels initially anticipated 
some previously announced support units have been told they would 
likely be activated but have not yet been called williams said 
the next challenge for military planners provided no 
hostilities erupt will be sustaining the force in the mideast 
some 7000 miles from the united states 
dozens of support trucks and scores of pallets loaded with 
materiel and supplies are being prepared for shipment to the 
region and some of the ships now returning without orders might be 
called upon in the near future to make another trip to saudi 
arabia 
theres all kinds of stuff that doesnt have to be there in 
the first days and weeks that we will need to stay there for any 
length of time one of the pentagon source said but theres 
not the same sense of urgency with these things

q how long how long can you hold out how long can you let the 
government stay shut down before you decide the cost has been too 
great 
a watch and learn 
q how long do you think government can stay shut before 
a its not a question of how long i can take it its how long 
the congress can take it the congress is where the action is its 
the congress that has to pass this in the house and in the senate 
thats where the action is theyve postponed this tough decision 
as i mentioned how many 30some times and we just cant have it 
the american people are saying i want something done about 
this and thats where the focus will be so i dont think its a 
question of taking heat here these guys marching out here about 
honking their horns of taxes they know i dont like taxes you 
get some other guy marching out here with a little placard 
demonstrating giving something about the government employees i 
weve been supporters of the government employees but we cannot 
have business as usual the american people i dont know about 
inside the beltway but outside they are fed up with business as 
usual and so am i 
and i wish i had total control so we could do it exactly my way 
but we dont so ive compromised and now were prepared to say im 
not going to accept a resolution that just postpones it ive told 
you ive tried that approach tried it in august let everybody go 
home on vacation when i had some good sound advice i probably 
should have taken make the congress stay in august 
and i listened to the leaders and i said they said oh 
please dont do that itll be counterproductive now theyre 
saying to me please dont veto this itll be when do the 
american people have a say they want to see this deficit under 
control and i dont have many weapons here as president but one 
is the veto and when i do it cast it on principle i hope it is 
supported 
q mr president when dole sends up another cr or if the 
congress sends up a cr with sequestration when could that happen 
could you give us some timeframe 
a i dont know 
q could it happen in the next couple of days sir 
a oh yeah yeah absolutely it could happen this afternoon 
q so it could happen this afternoon 
a sure when they get together 
q and it came up to 
a now im not that 
q sure 
a that perhaps is a little oversimplification because they are 
telling me theres some difficult problems right and left both 
sides but no theyre going right back to negotiating and lets 
hope it does thats the way to serve the people 
q if it came up this afternoon sir would you sign it this 
afternoon 
a depends what it is 
q you have vetoed the 
a ill be around 
q you have vetoed the cr 
a yeah well i havent actually signed it but ive got to 
rush right in there now and do that and send it up to the hill 
they know that theyve inaudible 
cross talk 
a last question 
q whats all this done to the prestige and influence of you and 
your office 
a i think it will demonstrate that there is some power in the 
presidency to get the to compel the congrss to do something and 
i think thats good 
q you are veto 
a oh yeah itll it hasnt been vetoed yet but i just its 
had needed need a typewriter in there to get it done but it by 
the time we finish this press conference that has gone longer than 
i thought itll probably all be typed up 
q might you trade the bubble for capital gains now do you 
foresee that an answer 
a our negotiators are have a lot of the negotiators in the 
congress have a lot of flexibility i remain in a flexible frame of 
mind certain things i can accept and cant but id like to think 
that now theyll those who postured on one side or another with 
no responsibility will join the leaders republican and democrat 
and say hey we got a responsibility to the overall good here 
we can no longer just give a speech weve got to pitch in and come 
together 
and thats thats what my pitch is and thats why im doing 
this veto saying hey no more business as usual and i i 
think people understand that sometime a president has to make a 
difficult decision and so i dont worry about the prestige i im 
selected to do what what faced like this what i think is best 
and in the national interest and thats exactly what im doing 
thank you all very much

lebanons leading newspaper reported 
saturday that anglican church envoy terry waite and some other 
westerners held hostage by proiranian shiite moslem groups may be 
released this week 
annahar which has a record of accurate reporting on the 
captives attributed its short report to informed sources but did 
not identify them 
the paper indicated that the releases would follow visits to 
syria and possibly to lebanon by iranian foreign minister ali akbar 
velayati 
velayati was to visit damascus in the next two days for 
consultations with the syrian command of president hafez assad 
and might travel to beirut for talks with president elias hrawi 
the report said 
the release of a number of foreign hostages held in lebanon 
topped by anglican chrich envoy terry waite is possible next 
week the newspaper said in its saturday edition 
it gave no further details the oneparagraph reference to the 
hostages was part of the papers main frontpage story 
annahar did not disclose the nationalities of the hostages to 
be released beyond identifying waite but the report was the 
latest of several to indicate that foreign captives would be freed 
following renewed diplomatic ties between britain and iran 
the two nations restored ties last month after an 18month break 
over british author salman rushdies book the satanic verses 
which iran said defamed islam 
hussein musawi the shiite mentor of some hostageholding 
factions said sept 29 that the four british hostages would 
benefit from the development 
musawi said however that the six american captives were not 
expected to be released soon because of the us military 
deployment in the persian gulf following iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
improving relations and the new british conduct toward iran 
would serve british interests in general including the british 
hostages said musawi whose islamic amal movement falls under 
the hezbollah umbrella 
waite 51 the personal envoy of the archbishop of canterbury 
robert runcie disappeared jan 20 1987 he had left his hotel in 
moslem west beirut for a meeting with islamic jihad or islamic 
holy war the underground faction believed holding american 
hostages terry anderson and thomas sutherland 
no group has claimed waites abduction but former irish hostage 
brian keenan released in august said he was held with the 
anglican envoy for a while in the same house 
anderson 42 chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the longestheld foreign hostage in lebanon he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985 
in addition to waite the british captives are journalist john 
mccarthy world war ii flier jack mann and writer alec collett 
mccarthy 33 was kidnapped april 17 1986 as he drove to 
beirut airport to catch a flight to london mann 76 was kidnapped 
in beirut may 12 1989 
collet a new yorkbased writer on assignment in lebanon for the 
un relief and works agency was kidnapped march 25 1985 
the revolutionary organization of socialist moslems believed 
linked to palestinian terrorist abu nidal claimed on april 23 
1986 that it hanged collett in retaliation for britains support of 
us air raids on libya 
no body has been found but british officials believe collett is 
dead 
the 13 western captives held mainly by proiranian factions in 
lebanon also include two germans and an italian 
the annahar article also said velayati was to develop along 
with syrian and lebanese leaders a settlement to the 3yearold 
conflict between two rival shiite moslem militias the proiranian 
hezbollah and the more secular amal 
on saturday the two militias fought a 30minute battle in the 
slums of south beirut before syrian troops separated the 
combatants 
police said two people were killed and three wounded in the 
clash with automatic rifles and rocketpropelled grenade launchers 
a few blocks from where the western captives are believed held 
that raised the overall toll of the amalhezbollah power 
struggle to 1099 killed and 3225 wounded since the conflict broke 
out in june 1985 
syria is amals main ally and has a limited influence on 
hezbollah through its close ties with iran 
about 40000 syrian troops went into lebanon under a 1976 
peacekeeping mandate from the 21nation arab league syria is the 
main power broker in lebanons 15yearold civil war

no huddled masses assembled saturday at the 
statue of liberty which was shut down by a tired and poor federal 
government 
thousands of sightseers from around the united states and the 
world felt one of the first effects of the federal budget dispute 
they trekked to lower manhattan to catch ferries to liberty and 
ellis islands only to find the boats werent running 
its very annoying said magdalene kopp of heidelberg 
germany its something i came to the united states to see 
instead of the outstretched arm of lady liberty or ellis 
islands cavernous waiting room tourists were greeted by a 
disheartening monotone announcement over loudspeakers 
attention visitors the statue of liberty and ellis island are 
closed until further notice sorry for the inconvenience 
helen bealka 62 traveled from st paul minn to see ellis 
island where her father first set foot in america 
this is horrible i dont know if ill live long enough to 
come back she said 
the ellis island closing came less than a month after the 
renovated area was reopened to the public 
the closures resulted from bushs refusal to sign a stopgap 
spending plan as his administration and congress haggled over a new 
budget 
getting turned away from the nations symbol of freedom was 
enough to convince most visitors they were the victims of undue 
suffering at politicians hands 
its a disgrace when reasonable people cant agree on 
something why cant these clowns get together on this said 
henry bowman 44 of cookeville tenn this was our one chance to 
go 
said abigail hoffman 33 of new york city i wish theyd make 
some hard choices thats why they were voted in 
national park service employee eli mecardo usually sells liberty 
island ferry tickets but on saturday he too was turned back 
they just told us to go home he said they said the 
government ran out of money and were not getting paid 
although most people grumbled and cursed washington a few 
thought the inconvenience was for the common good 
im disappointed but its one of the things that happen in 
government said ruth flaton 72 of elmont maybe its one way 
to balance the budget i think bush did the right thing

riot police wielding batons and shields 
prevented prodemocracy campaigners from meeting saturday to 
establish zambias first legal opposition party in 17 years 
paramilitary units stood guard outside the moon city night club 
in the zambian capital barring hundreds of wouldbe party 
delegates from entering 
the legal committee of the socalled movement for multiparty 
democracy which called the meeting immediately filed an 
injunction with the high court against the police 
but high court judge bobby bwalya postponed the hearing for a 
week so officials from the movement and from president kenneth 
kaundas ruling united national independence party could testify 
there was no immediate comment from the government 
kaunda 66 who led zambia to independence from britain as a 
westernstyle democracy in 1964 imposed a oneparty state in 1973 
last month under mounting pressure from lawyers students 
trade unionists and businessmen kaunda agreed to rewrite the 
constitution to legalize opposition parties 
earlier he legalized the prodemocracy group and announced 
multiparty elections would be held next august to allow his 75

the biggest human airlift in aviation 
history is ferrying hundreds of penniless asian refugees from the 
persian gulf to their homelands daily but a shortage of relief aid 
could clip its wings 
relief officials also fear that many of the estimated 2 million 
foreigners still in iraq and kuwait may soon flee as well putting 
enormous strain on the operation and on jordan the main escape 
route 
some 422400 refugees mainly egyptian and asians have been 
flown out of jordan in more than 1798 flights by military and 
civilian aircraft since aug 5 jordanian civil aviation officials 
said 
another 60000 have been flown home from turkey and hundreds of 
thousands mainly egyptians have been taken home by sea 
this is the biggest airlift operation ever undertaken in civil 
aviation said jn mahajan the indian consulgeneral in dubai 
who has overseen the repatriation of nearly 17000 of his 
countrymen through the southern gulf state 
on saturday the united nations announced a contingency plan to 
help refugees if the gulf crisis escalates or extends into the 
winter un undersecretarygeneral mohammed essaafi said the 
world bodys disaster relief agency and jordanian officials are 
preparing food stockpiles to feed up to 120000 more refugees 
they also are buying winter tents to replace the summer tents in 
jordanian refugee camps 
half the 335000 egyptians who fled kuwait and iraq after saddam 
husseins aug 2 invasion of the gulf emirate have been airlifted 
home by the cairo government most of the estimated 70000 indians 
repatriated have been flown home 
all told some 900000 people have fled into jordan saudi 
arabia turkey syria and iran in the last two months 720000 of 
them through jordan alone 
the state department fears that as conditions deteriorate 
because of unimposed economic sanctions many of the 2 million 
foreigners still in iraq and kuwait will try to flee 
un relief officials have warned that there could be a new 
surge in the exodus soon because the iraqis have said they will cut 
food rations to foreigners trapped in the two countries jordanian 
authorities expect 80000 new refugees in the next week 
all this will intensify the pressure on relief workers who are 
now seeking to help the refugees through the approaching winter 
and will cost tens of millions of dollars 
many of the relief flights are organized by the genevabased 
international organization for migration one of its senior 
officials david whittlesey said in a telephone interview that 
more money is needed urgently to pay for the airlift 
whittlesey said the relief effort in its scale and nature is 
a unique situation 
its extremely difficult to predict the rate of flow from iraq 
and kuwait which nationalities these refugees will be where they 
will want to go what condition theyll be in its a logistical 
nightmare 
the indian government has paid more than 14 million to air 
india to ferry more than 13000 citizens out by oct 3 
iraq last month allowed the indian air force to send in four 
flights a day to the southern port of basra to evacuate about 1000 
indian nationals daily 
pakistan has evacuated some 45000 of the 190000 nationals it 
had in iraq and kuwait mainly through jordan thailands national 
carrier has flown more than 40 flights carrying more than 7500 
thai refugees from jordan and saudi arabia to bangkok 
the us government last month flew some 1900 of its citizens 
out of baghdad in chartered jetliners after iraqi leader saddam 
hussein allowed them to leave another group is expected to fly out 
on wednesday officials said 
the soviet union has flown more than 2500 of its people out of 
iraq in aeroflot jetliners and brazil chartered an iraqi airways 
jumbo jet last week to fly out 173 of its citizens after weeks of 
tough negotiations

the us military command 
then they went off to patrices room to talk family and call 
their mother sandra back in charleston

darnetha describing herself as a sort of upbeat person 
said of her brothers and sisters that she didnt mind being in 
saudi arabia as long as i can see them and know theyre ok i try 
not to think about the bad stuff

ever get into a situation 
i still worry a lot but i know theyre going to be coming 
home on their own two feet he said 
patrice said she enlisted in the navy while still in high school 
and left for the service 13 days after graduation i was being a 
rebel she recalled my father wanted me to go to college i

the public as usual is fed up with politics as 
usual but disgruntled voters in three states and one city are 
considering turning their grumbling into action on nov 6 
ballot proposals in colorado california and missouri would 
limit how long elected officials can serve proposals creating 
state ethics panels also are on ballots in missouri and california 
missouris proposed amendment would also reduce the size of the 
house from 163 to 103 members by 2003 and shorten legislative 
sessions 
bolstering support for the amendment were the convictions of two 
missouri house members in us district court last month one on 
felony drug charges the other for conspiring to steal union 
property and sell it to repay a federal grant 
colorados proposal would not only limit state legislators the 
governor and other state officeholders to eight years in office 
but also impose a cap of 12 years for us house and senate 
members critics question whether such a cap would be permissable 
under the federal constitution 
kansas city mo residents will decide on election day whether 
to limit city council members to two fouryear terms that proposal 
could force nine of 13 members out of office next april 
oklahoma voters recently approved an amendment limiting state 
lawmakers to 12 years in office effective jan 1 and also 
established an ethics comission 
arizonans meanwhile are considering a pay increase for state 
legislators to 24000 from 15000 the last such raise which 
must be approved by voters under state law was in 1981 they 
defeated a similar recommendation in 1988 
skepticism about public officials has of course a long 
history 
a half century ago hl mencken wrote at each election we 
vote in a new set of politicians insanely assuming that they are 
better than the set turned out and at each election we are as 
they say done in 
but ballot issues limiting legislators terms are unprecedented 
said karl kurtz director of state services for national conference 
of state legislatures some states have limited governors terms 
before though he said 
i think this is occurring because of disillusionment over 
government and it is showing in election returns kurtz said 
i dont think any one thing has forced this its just a general 
sense of unhappiness with governmental institutions and the image 
of politicians 
kurtz called the propositions antidemocratic in spirit 
the colorado proposal is spearheaded by state sen terry 
considine a republican from wealthy cherry hills village who 
believes the state legislature like congress is gridlocked 
its not that we do the wrong things its that we dont 
tackle the real problems considine said we work very hard at 
incremental improvements but we are much less successful at 
accomplishing real change 
two years ago colorado voters limited annual legislative 
sessions to 120 days 
term limitations are addressed in two proposals on californias 
november ballot proposition 131 and proposition 140 politicians 
including assembly speaker willie brown are mobilizing to kill 
both 
one proposition is a clean government amendment with ethics and 
campaign finance provisions including term limitations allowing 
legislators to serve 12 years in each house of the california state 
assembly or 24 years total 
the other more stringent proposal would bar legislators from 
serving more than eight years in the state senate and six in the 
house it would have the effect of cutting the legislatures next 
fiscal year budget by as much as half

todays stateoftheart solar car looks 
like a waisthigh 20footlong bright yellow plastic tadpole 
getting in without breaking it is an adventure and only one person 
will fit 
and taking one home from the showroom isnt likely soon the 
price tag comes to about 650000 plus 350000 for computers and 
other ancillary equipment 
but the squat yellow university of michigan sunrunner has one 
thing going for it its a national champion in solar speed and 
its headed for an international challenge on the roadways of 
australia next month 
in july the sunrunner and 31 other solarpowered cars built by 
college teams raced from floridas disney world to general motors 
corps technical center in the detroit suburb of warren the 
sunrunner traveling by day and resting overnight won the 
1641mile race with a time of 72 hours 50 minutes and 47 seconds 
averaging 225 mph 
gm is sending the sunrunner and other top finishers to the world 
solar challenge 1990 race in all 43 cars from 10 countries are 
entered in the race which begins nov 11 and will stretch 1863 
miles from darwin on australias northern coast to adelaide on the 
south coast 
for the race the sunrunner team hopes to reach an average speed 
of 32 mph 
to take the car out for a recent test drive at the michigan 
international speedway industrial engineer paula finnegan had to 
buckle on a safety harness then have a colleague boost her up into 
the open top of the car inside she balanced on the 
aluminumtubing skeleton and the hammocklike seat slung down in the 
frame 
she then threaded her legs through the junglegymlike tubing to 
the accelerator and brake reclined in the seat buckled on harness 
straps and put on a headset with earpiece and microphone 
the sunrunner still wasnt ready three people gingerly lifted 
its floppy plastic canopy from the ground lowered it over finnegan 
and sealed it in place with bright yellow tape 
during test laps it reached 23 mph on a mostly sunny day with 
thin high clouds for faster speeds or hills the sunrunners 
circuitry draws on battery help at slower speeds or going 
downhill it puts excess power from the solar cells back into the 
batteries 
in bright sun the solar cells produce about 1200 watts enough 
to power a toaster oven hair dryer or the 500pound sunrunner 
cloudy weather can cut the power to 300 to 400 watts enough for a 
bright light bulb 
a 15 horsepower electric motor the size of a coffee can powers 
the car via chain drive on one of the 26inch mountainbike wheels 
theres a viewing slot to view the road ahead and a rearward 
facing fiberoptic viewer that allows the driver to get an idea of 
whats behind 
two ports in the front of the cockpit bring in fresh air the 
drivers said it wasnt too bad as long as they kept moving said 
mike mcalear strategist for the team 
for now electric cars will have to rely on batteries solar 
cells and motors must become more efficient before energy straight 
from the sun can propel a car faster than 30 mph 
solar cars therefore arent on the verge of practical commuting 
finnegan said 
not any time in the near future but with improved technology 
it can happen

opposition legislators demanded 
saturday that president roh taewoo apologize for alleged political 
surveillance by military intelligence agents 
the nations main opposition group the party for peace and 
democracy urged roh to overhaul the defense security command the 
military surveillance unit and end military interference in 
politics 
the party also demanded a full explanation from roh of the 
alleged activities 
the outcry followed the disclosure friday of alleged evidence of 
undercover operations by the command against 1300 dissidents 
journalists intellectuals and lawmakers from both the opposition 
and government 
the alleged evidence was revealed by yoon sukyang a 
24yearold army private who deserted from the security command 
taking with him classified papers computer discs and other data 
the data included the names and personal records of ruling party 
chairman kim youngsam opposition leader kim daejung and 89 other 
lawmakers 
the data characterized kim daejung as dangerous 
untrustworthy and showed that kim youngsam and his followers 
were under surveillance even after his party joined the ruling 
group in january 
the defense ministry said the data and other materials were 
stolen from the security command but said such data was kept not 
for political surveillance but to protect those listed from 
enemies or impure elements the ministry did not elaborate 
the government has two powerful intelligence organizations the 
defense security command and the agency for national security 
planning 
disgraced former president chun doohwan who is in rural exile 
headed the command in 1980 when he seized power with other military 
officers roh played a role as an army division commander 
roh has promised to maintain the militarys political neutrality 
since he took office in early 1988 but fridays revelations forced 
some to question that pledge 
both ruling and opposition party leaders demanded that roh fully 
account for the militarys surveillance activity kim daejungs 
party called for a public investigation saying the command was used 
to bolster authoritarian rules 
roh captured twothirds of the legislative seats in january by 
merging his party with two conservative opposition groups 
opponents claim the merger was an attempt to prolong his rule and 
gain enough votes to seek political changes 
political tension has heightened since all 78 opposition members 
of the 299member national assembly resigned in august charging 
roh with railroading bills through the legislature and ignoring 
calls for reform 
the opposition has refused to return to the assembly and demands 
elections for a new legislature

ahmed kadry who headed the egyptian 
antiquities organization through a turbulent six years that began 
and ended with rocks falling from the sphinx has died in the 
united states friends said saturday he was 59 
kadrys friends said he died thursday in pittsburgh where he 
was awaiting a liver transplant suffering from liver cancer he 
fell into a coma before the operation could be performed 
he was honest active brave frank said gamal mukhtar 
another former chairman of the antiquities organization 
kadrys career was long and turbulent he was among the young 
officers who joined lt col gamal abdel nasser in the 1952 coup 
that ended the monarchy and eventually led to republican egypt 
kadry later was to spend time in nassers jails during one of 
the former dictators crackdowns on dissent 
after his military career kadry spent 26 years with the 
egyptian antiquities organization 
he became chairman in 1982 after a stone fell from the decaying 
sphinx and cost his predecessor the job six years later kadry was 
fired in a similar controversy when a rock fell from the right 
shoulder of the giant statue in february 1988 
soon after culture minister farouk hosni and kadry engaged in a 
heated public argument hosni kadrys boss charged that a 
restoration project in progress since kadry became chairman had 
endangered the monument 
kadry retaliated with allegations that the ministers agents 
hammered the stone out to embarrass him hosni fired kadry 
a bitter kadry left egypt to join the faculty of tokyos waseda 
university 
criticism of kadrys sphinx restoration continues but in recent 
months some critics have praised his other achievements as 
chairman a television commentator referred to his tenure as the 
golden age of egyptian antiquities 
kadry is best remembered for restoration work on ancient mosques 
and other islamic monuments including saladins fortress 
overlooking cairo and his small fort in the gulf of aqaba 
the strongwilled kadry became chairman of antiquities as the 
outside world was starting to realize that egypts vast historic 
legacy wouldnt last forever 
pollution underground salt a burgeoning population neglect 
and mass tourism were destroying the monuments looking for ways to 
stop the decay or at least slow it down kadry shifted his 
organizations emphasis from excavation to preservation 
he turned to foreign help and imported technology to fight the 
battle for this commentators assailed him vigorously accusing 
him of letting foreigners pillage egypts past as they had done 
during colonial times

republican gubernatorial candidate mary mead 
is sorry for a speech she made but not because of anything she 
said 
i got reports saying it was boring and that i hadnt really 
said anything she said 
a week after the sept 19 speech she wrote a letter to 
apologize for the speech not necessarily to change anybodys mind 
about me but just to let them know that it mattered to me 
mead addressed the wyoming association of county officials and 
lightly touched on court reform recycling and legalized gambling 
among other topics 
in her letter she said she heard people say that she didnt 
address the issues and wasted an opportunity to make a 
favorable impression on some important wyoming voters 
and regrettably i agree mead wrote even before i left 
your meeting i knew that my remarks had not served me well some 
days are great and some arent and i wish i could redo that 
one 
mead is hoping to unseat incumbent gov mike sullivan whos 
seeking his second term in the states executive office

nineyearold michael woodward went looking 
for pandas and koala bears at the national zoo on saturday but 
instead found locked and shuttered buildings because of a budget 
fight between the white house and congress 
im really disappointed ive been saving for a long time for 
this trip i guess ill have to come back to see the pandas said 
the boy who journeyed from harrisburg pa with his parents and a 
church group to see the zoo 
the zoos grounds were open but huts housing reptiles apes 
birds and aquatic life were closed 
the scene was duplicated at some of the nations most famous 
tourist spots from the statue of liberty in new york to the st 
louis arch as president bushs decision to shut down 
nonessential services took effect early saturday in the absence of 
a budget agreement 
i think its a cheap shot closing the smithsonian 
institution museums like this you can bet they didnt cut their 
salaries maria raices a new hampshire resident complained 
about congress and the white houses inability to settle the 
budget dispute that allowed the government to run out of money 
if tourists were inconvenienced most federal workers had not 
yet felt the impact of possible furloughs a threeday columbus day 
weekend meant most cuts would not be felt until tuesday at the 
earliest and the bush administration said it had authority to 
maintain essential services such as the military prisons and the 
air traffic control system well beyond then 
the national hurricane center announced plans to remain in 
business and was continuing to keep tabs on tropical storm klaus 
that was little comfort to those who flocked on saturday to the 
nations capital in hopes of visiting its famed attractions the 
white house tours the washington monument the smithsonians 13 
museums and art galleries 
their first comment in harmony was it stinks boy scout 
leader bill johnson said of his scouts reaction to finding the 
national air and space museum closed the troop had traveled from 
roanoke rapids nc to spend the day sightseeing 
the 15 scouts marched down the mall past the closed museums 
toward the capitol hoping they could get in to see congress 
maybe this wont be a lost weekend after all the boys wont 
forget this and i expect theyll go home and tell their parents 
about what happened to them johnson said 
at the air and space museum tourists packing cameras and video 
equipment pressed their noses against the glass front straining to 
glimpse the nasa rockets boosters and airplanes suspended from the 
ceiling inside 
this ones closed too dad the people are just peeking 
inside one youngster glumly called out 
evelyn abes of new york city who was wrapping up a fiveday 
visit to washington with her 9yearold grandson had been saving 
the air and space tour for last 
this was going to be the highlight of our trip she said 
waving toward the museum i guess well have to do the car stuff 
now 
the governments shutdown is not making you stop eating or 
causing a loss of blood or anything but this is a quality of life 
issue enlightening children and helping them learn about the 
world mrs abes said 
many outoftown sightseers were flustered by the locked 
museums wondering out loud at signs that said all smithsonian 
museums are closed today we regret the inconvenience 
friendly informed tourists told them why congress couldnt 
pass its bill they said or the governments run out of 
money 
sightseers from around the globe felt the impact in new york 
when they trekked to lower manhattan to catch ferries to liberty 
and ellis islands to see the statue of liberty only to find the 
boats werent running 
helen bealka 62 traveled from st paul minn to see ellis 
island where her father first set foot in america this is 
horrible i dont know if ill live long enough to come back she 
said 
the nations parks were affected too as rangers nationwide 
began locking gates and closing down camp grounds when word was 
dispatched from washington that the federal government was out of 
money 
a bus load of tourists from indiana drove six hours to reach the 
great smoky mountains national park in tennessee only to be turned 
away by rangers 
its really unfair to rub this in the peoples face this is 
really not helping relations with the public i just feel like 
its a political ploy said bob davenport leading the group from 
muncie ind 
at the white house the staff that serves the presidents living 
quarters ushers butlers chefs maids has already been cut 
from 70 to 10 we wont be having any big dinners around here 
said presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater

space shuttle discovery rocketed 
into orbit saturday carrying americans into space for the first 
time in nearly six months and starting the robot craft ulysses on a 
fiveyear voyage of solar exploration 
the fiveman discovery crew smoothly accomplished its primary 
goal casting off ulysses exactly as planned the probe then 
rocketed itself out of earth orbit 
good deploy houston said mission commander richard n 
richards after the solar probe was freed from the shuttle 
ulysses is on its way 
thats a great job mission control replied 
three rocket stages then fired automatically on ulysses and the 
craft was accelerated out of earth orbit at 34130 mph the fastest 
speed ever for a manmade object 
mission control told the astronauts that ground monitors in guam 
and australia determined ulysses was exactly where it should be 
indicating that the rocket stages fired as planned 
fantastic exclaimed an astronaut from space 
the atomicpowered solar explorer started its independent voyage 
six hours after the shuttle was launched by dawns early light 
discovery roared from its seaside launch pad and climbed flawlessly 
to a 184milehigh orbit 
ulysses will follow a roundabout path first cruising away from 
the sun toward jupiter the powerful gravity pull of that giant 
planet will act like a slingshot accelerating the probe to an even 
higher speed and sending it streaking back toward the sun 
in 1994 ulysses will pass over the suns south pole then curve 
over the north solar pole the suns poles cannot be seen from 
earth and have never been explored 
because ulysses is powered by a generator energized by more than 
20 pounds of plutonium antinuclear activists filed a lawsuit to 
block the launch of the radioactive material but a federal judge 
ruled against their petition friday that same day two of 20 
antinuclear demonstrators were arrested at the kennedy space 
center 
nasa staffers cheered as discovery soared into space only 12 
minutes later than the planned 735 am launch time the delay was 
caused by a minor weather problem and a lastminute technical 
glitch 
discoverys mission is scheduled to last four days with a 
landing wednesday in california the launch wasnt affected by the 
shutdown of many federal agencies because funds for the mission 
already had been set aside officials said 
after the craft settled into orbit mission control in houston 
told the astronauts there are a lot of smiling faces down here 
on the ground 
theres a lot of smiling faces up here too replied 
richards you all did a great job getting us off the pad this 
morning we couldnt ask for anything better 
the launch came after months of frustation for nasa 
a mysterious hydrogen fuel leak still unsolved forced a series 
of launch cancellations for space shuttles columbia and atlantis 
nasas last previous launch was april 24 when discovery took off 
another embarrassment came over the summer when nasa engineers 
learned that the 15 billion hubble space telescope had been 
manufactured with an error that gives it a blurred view of the 
universe the error was not found until after it had been deployed 
in space by discovery last april 
and last week nasa was embarrassed again when workers left a 
70pound metal beam inside the engine compartment of atlantis and 
the beam caused some minor damage when it clanked around inside as 
the spacecraft was lifted and rotated by a crane 
the smooth launch on saturday was a boost for nasas morale 
said launch director bob sieck 
were obviously pleased he said 
the mood among space workers he said is one of euphoria or 
relief its certainly good to be back on orbit the team 
worked real hard for this they got their reward finally 
sieck said discovery had only a few minor problems in its 
countdown toward launch he said the craft is the fleet leader 
right now because it got us back to flight again 
besides richards the crew members are pilot robert d cabana 
and mission specialists william m shepherd bruce melnick and 
thomas d akers

president bush who rarely stays in town on 
weekends presided saturday over an executive mansion darkened and 
empty of tourists and where even finding someone to type up a veto 
proved problematic 
the president canceled a holiday weekend visit to his oceanside 
home in kennebunkport maine and remained in washington to keep 
tabs on the federal budget stalemate 
when congress failed to produce a new budget agreement on 
friday the government officially ran out of money and all 
nonessential government services were shut down effective saturday 
at 1201 am edt 
much of the white house also was shut down tours were canceled 
saturday and only a skeleton staff of aides and attendants were 
allowed to come to work 
but the president declared a defiant watch and learn when 
asked how longhe was prepared to allow the government to remain 
closed down to make his point with congress 
and he raised the stakes by vetoing a bill congress had passed 
the night before to avert a government shutdown 
but since the bulk of bushs clerical and press staff had been 
deemed nonessential and told not to report to work getting 
the word out about the veto wasnt all that easy 
well bush conceded to reporters it hasnt been vetoed yet 
need a typewriter in there to get it done 
by the time we finish this press conference that has gone 
longer than i thought itll probably be all typed up he added 
bushs spokesman marlin fitzwater explained later we dont 
have any secretaries around here although he also said that he 
thought the veto message had been typed the night before 
even bushs news conference to announce the veto was unusual 
the press briefing room where he usually speaks with reporters 
was dark and empty but the president had no problem finding 
cameras and reporters 
he walked outside the white house and stepped up to the battery 
of microphones in the driveway from which congressional leaders had 
just departed including democrats who blasted bush for his veto 
decision 
it was the first time in recent memory that a president has held 
a news conference in the driveway dozens of tourists barred entry 
to the white house because of the shutdown pressed against the 
fence along pennsylvania avenue to peer at the president and the 
large crowd of reporters surrounding him 
the rule that only essential government workers could remain on 
the job apparently did not apply to presidential motorcades bush 
took an 11car procession to a church in the georgetown section of 
the city to attend the wedding the wedding of white house personnel 
chief chase untermeyer 
since taking office in january 1989 bush has only spent a 
handful of weekends in the white house usually he spends saturdays 
and sundays at the presidential retreat in camp david md or at 
his vacation home in maine

the budget crisis that has pitted the 
executive branch against the legislative branch the president 
against congress and democrats against republicans is grounded in 
years of government infighting over how best to cope with steadily 
rising federal deficits 
here are answers to some of questions most frequently asked 
about the impact of budget stalemate on the american people and 
their lives 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q why has the federal government been forced to start shutting 
down 
a because the budget dispute prevented enactment of any of the 
13 regular appropriations bills for fiscal 1991 the federal budget 
year that began oct 1 the constitution states that no money 
shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of 
appropriations made by law while some appropriations are in 
permanent law most daytoday government operations are renewed 
annually in one or another of the 13 appropriations bills 
what that means is that government agencies are not allowed to 
spend money including salaries purchases and so forth unless 
there is a law authorizing them to spend money since there wasnt 
even a stopgap law in place saturday the agencies were legally 
required to send people home and close down 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q has this ever happened before 
a yes the government was forced to shut down temporarily three 
times in the past decade due to squabbles between the 
administration and congress over the budget 
the government closed briefly in november 1981 when an estimated 
400000 employees were dismissed at midday after president reagan 
vetoed an emergency money bill on october 4 1984 about 500000 
government workers were sent home by congress failure to approve 
an appropriations bill 
on october 16 1986 the government sent 500000 nonessential 
employees home at midday but congress later in the day passed an 
appropriations bill acceptable to reagan and workers were ordered 
to report on their next shift 
congress as it had done in 1981 and 1984 passed a resolution 
ordering that employees furloughed get their regular salaries 
anyway

q what is this grammrudman act i keep hearing so much 
about and why was it passed 
a congress enacted the law named for sens phil gramm 
rtexas and warren rudman rnh in 1985 and revised it in 1987 
some refer to it as grammrudmanhollings to reflect that sen 
ernest hollings dsc played a role in its creation 
passage of the law in effect was a legislative admission of 
failure a recognition by members of the house and senate that 
they could not make the tough choices necessary to staunch the flow 
of government red ink without a threat hanging over them 
the law requires congress and the president to reduce the 
deficit to predetermined annual targets leading eventually to a 
balanced budget grammrudman requires acrosstheboard spending 
cuts to make up the difference if those targets are missed the 
target for fiscal 1991 is 64 billion but the presidents estimates 
are so far above that number that bush and congress agree it is 
impossible to reach they will change it to a much higher number 
if they agree on an overall budget package 
the result will be to delay the goal of a balanced budget 
probably until 1996 or beyond 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q what events prompted the current shutdown 
a on sept 30 the last day of fiscal 1990 bush and the 
bipartisan congressional leadership announced agreement on a 
fiveyear 500 billion deficitreduction package that included 
approximately 134 billion in new taxes congress passed and bush 
signed a one week temporary appropriations bill to keep the 
government operating while congress passed the plan bush went on 
national television tuesday night to appeal for congressional 
support of the package but it was voted down thursday night 
members of the house and senate approved another stopgap 
spending measure known as a continuing resolution on friday 
that would have kept the government running until next friday oct 
12 and would have given lawmakers another weeks time to arrive at 
a budget consensus but bush vetoed that bill saturday 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q how will the shutdown affect my life can i still catch my 
flight for example 
a the government began closing socalled nonessential 
facilities saturday but air traffic controllers are among those 
considered essential federal aviation administration spokesman bob 
buckhorn says those essential services remain in place at air 
control towers however if the deadlock persisted there would be 
a reduction in the number of controllers allowed to work 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
q what is meant by essential and nonessential 
a each agency decides what is an essential service but 
generally staying on the job will be workers dealing with national 
security health emergency and similar things the military air 
traffic controllers border guards medical institution personnel 
and prison guards will be unaffected federal meat and poultry 
inspection will continue during a general shutdown

at 100 years old ethel pierce hasnt 
forgotten nursing the boys of world war i sometimes filling 
out night reports with her feet propped up on a water pail to stop 
the rats from running up her legs 
now its time for her government to remember says pierce who 
like most residents of the holyoke soldiers home doesnt know where 
shell go after april 1 the date the facility is scheduled to 
close because of state budget cuts 
its a shame she said we went to war and we didnt 
know whether wed get back or not 
leaving the holyoke home perched on a hilltop that overlooks 
the wooded connecticut valley would mean losing contact with 
family and friends veterans said 
this is a lovely place said pierce who from her 
fourthfloor room looks out on a view many hotels would envy a sea 
of darkgreen pines flecked with the russets of maple as fall 
foliage season approached 
the cuts part of a 310 million reduction announced by gov 
michael dukakis on sept 25 set closing dates for the holyoke 
home another soldiers home in chelsea and several boston shelters 
including a place for homeless veterans recognized by president 
bushs thousand points of light program 
since that announcement state officials said they will keep the 
homes and shelters open if the legislature approves alternative 
cuts 
the uncertainty hasnt been good for veterans peace of mind 
said holyoke soldiers home superintendent rudolph chmura 
youre up high one minute and youre down low these people 
are on medical treatment they dont need that he said 
veterans said theyre not asking for a handout 
i wonder what the thoughts are of a recruiter today if he 
were to tell that recruit i am sorry but by the time youre 65 
youll have to find your own way so be careful said 
75yearold john landers who lost both legs as a result of 
injuries he suffered when a tank caught fire 
david joyce 80 and a member of the holyoke homes board of 
trustees who is staying temporarily at the facility for medical 
treatment called the closing an absolute disgrace and said he 
doubts putting residents in a nursing home will save the state any 
money 
the state has always owned and operated the holyoke home many 
of its 245 residents would end up in nursing homes where the state 
would still be responsible for half of the cost of their care 
through the medicaid program 
my wifes in a nursing home that costs 110 a day i figure at 
the end of a year our resources and whatever else we had will be 
gone maybe he said 
chelsea veterans were equally dismayed to hear of the closing 
date which would displace 450 people said paul mcnamara 
assistant superintendent 
dukakis has said he had no choice but to make the cuts because 
he has the power to withhold money only from executive agencies he 
said he will ask the legislature the courts and the constitutional 
officers to make further cuts in their budgets which would free 
13 million for human service programs including the 5 million 
needed to keep the soldiers homes open 
state officials denied that veterans are pawns in a political 
power play 
its unfortunately the nature of reality said dukakis 
spokesman steve crawford over the last 14 months weve cut 100 
million a month from the state budget 
meanwhile the veterans wait 
pierce her face furrowed by the lines of a century set her 
chin resolutely at the thought of leaving the holyoke home where 
she has lived for 14 years 
her eyes magnified by thick glasses flickered with mischief as 
she recalled the days of 1917 when she dodged the wrath of a 
supervisor lord knows what war she was in before and joked 
with the british soldiers sent to her field hospital in france 
i said id go wherever necessary with the boys she said 
we didnt know whether wed be bombed or not but we went just 
the same

saddam hussein is moving so many iraqi citizens 
into kuwait that its population might choose to remain under 
baghdads rule even after saddam removed his troops israeli 
official said saturday 
iraq has been transferring its citizens into kuwait steadily 
since the invasion the officials said 
an israeli military official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said 50 percent of the emirates population at the 
moment are not kuwaitis he gave no further details 
this phenomena certainly exists and the longer it goes on 
the more irreversible the annexation becomes said yossi olmert 
head of the government press office 
the replacement of kuwaitis by iraqi citizens has been easy for 
iraq because many kuwaiti citizens were abroad on summer vacations 
during iraqs aug 2 invasion and have not returned to the occupied 
country olmert said 
following the population transfer saddam may offer at a 
certain stage an arrangement involving elections on the basis of 
the population existing in kuwait olmert said 
a similar assessment was made by housing minister ariel sharon 
who as defense minister led israel in the 1982 invasion of lebanon 
in a recent television interview sharon said onethird of 
kuwaiti residents have been replaced with iraqis and 
palestinians or jordanians of palestinian origin 
so a day can come and saddam can offer a political solution i 
withdraw from kuwait you withdraw from the gulf and saudi arabia 
and there will be a plebiscite in kuwait and we know what this 
plebiscite would show sharon said 
olmert said he could not estimate how many iraqis had been moved 
in whether it concerned 40 50 or 60 percent of kuwaits 
population 
there was no independent confirmation of the israeli claims 
even before the invasion less than half the residents of kuwait 
were kuwaitis 
kuwaits population was estimated at 17 to 18 million at the 
time of the iraqi invasion including about one million expatriate 
workers 
of the 800000 kuwaitis about 300000 are believed still inside 
the occupied country the others fled after the invasion most to 
saudi arabia where the ousted emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah 
has set up a governmentinexile 
the englishlanguage daily jerusalem post newspaper in a sept 
27 editorial titled palestinizing kuwait also discussed the 
issue 
the palestinians have expropriated the registration records of 
the kuwaiti interior ministry and handed them over to the 
iraqis it said 
olmert said kuwaits interior ministry and all its documents 
was under iraqi control 
thousands of palestinians with their families and belongings 
are being resettled in abandoned homes and whole neighborhoods are 
now inhabited exclusively by iraqis and palestinians who carry 
kuwaiti identity papers produced with confiscated kuwaiti 
equipment the post said 
it will not be long before the only genuine kuwaitis with 
allegiance to the exiled emir will themselves be living in exile 
too if they are living at all

the ruling military council has rebuffed 
foreign criticism and announced it will continue martial law in 
burma as long as it sees fit 
it is unacceptable for foreign countries at this delicate and 
sensitive stage and time of transition to exert unwarranted and 
unjust pressure on the nation said a government statement 
distributed to diplomatic missions friday and broadcast on state 
radio 
most western governments suspended aid to burma after the 
military brutally seized power in september 1988 the military has 
refused to transfer power to a democratic coalition that won 
elections held in may 
government troops raided the west german british and us 
embassies late last month and detained burmese employees of western 
missions 
the government on thursday rejected frederick vreeland as the 
new us ambassador after he criticized burmese human rights 
conditions and other policies at his confirmation hearings in 
washington 
whatever external pressure is exerted the ruling council 
will continue to shoulder the task that has been set out the 
government statement saidsuch pressure by a minority of 
countries can only be detrimental to the interests of these 
countries 
should it be deemed necessary the ruling council will 
continue to exercise martial law until such time that a firm 
constitutionally established government has come into being the 
statement said 
the military has said it will make unspecified constitutional 
changes before stepping down or allowing democratic rule

stood in long lines to ogle the lower reaches of the white house 
instead found all the action was in congress where an unusually 
bitter budget fight was being waged with president bush 
they piled into elevators and rode to the third floor house and 
senate visitor galleries and then they waited for their chance to 
be admitted to hear the verbal jousting over the budget crisis that 
had begun to shut down some segments of the government

anybody attending to this chamber so we can stand here and argue 
about this 
sen terry sanford dnc thought president bush had gone too 
far in vetoing a stopgap spending bill that would have postponed 
the government shutdown for a week 
it was a childish act a temper tantrum sanford declared 
people bent forward craning their necks as sen wendell ford

economics minister eugen dijmarescu 
said saturday that the government has decided to fire thousands of 
managers of romanias huge largely failing stateowned industries 
he also said most subsidies for consumer goods will be abolished 
soon to bring their prices in line with real market values 
officials hope that will restore the stocks of stateowned 
stores which have been depleted by speculators reselling the goods 
on the black market at higher prices 
dijmarescu said the government will try to cushion inflationary 
pressures with measures aimed at increasing productivity which 
officials estimate dropped by about 20 percent over the past year 
among the measures will be reorganizing and privatizing most 
industries on the basis of competence and competitiveness he 
said that will include firing thousands of managers elected by 
workers committees following the december revolution that toppled 
the communist dictatorship of nicolae ceausescu 
the minister said most of these managers act like union 
representatives and do not understand that the government no 
longer sees itself responsible for providing industry with raw 
materials and financing their losses 
probably 60 to 70 percent of the existing managers will be 
replaced by a new leadership named on the basis of competence 
people who will make sure the factories produce more and 
enough to pay salaries he said in an interview 
dijmarescu said pending laws would link salaries to output once 
the romanian currency the leu is convertible production will 
also be stimulated by the competition from foreign firms he 
said 
the government plans to devalue the leu to achieve 
convertibility he said 
the official exchange rate is 20 leu to the dollar but the 
black market rate exceeds 100 in munich germany the leu is 
bought at 216 to the dollar 
dijmarescu said while the governing national salvation front won 
the may elections on a platform proposing transition through 
small steps the government is proposing a program of shock 
therapy and has been approved by parliament 
the government decided last week to halt credit lines to failing 
industries and to impose special taxes on industrial use of 
electric energy it will eliminate energy subsidies to most 
industries 
the measures were designed to assure the more than 23 million 
romanians sufficent heating and lighting in the coming winter 
ceausescu who was executed dec 25 allowed factories to keep 
operating even when power was cut off to homes 
the countrys economic problems have been aggravated by a 
reduction in energy imports from the soviet union and by iraqs 
cutoff of 17 billion in debt repayments which were to be made 
partially in the form of cheap gasoline iraq announced it would 
not pay the debt after romania supported un economic sanctions 
over the invasion of kuwait 
on saturday about 400 demonstrators marched through the capital 
shouting slogans against president ion iliescu and demanding the 
release of what they said were political prisoners 
the demonstration was organized by four small opposition parties 
the free republican party the christiandemocratic union the 
christian national democratic party and the independent peasants 
party of craiova 
nica leon a leader of the free republicans said we are 
expressing our opposition to the abusive arrests and the inhuman 
conditions suffered in prison by those who opposed iliescu 
iliescu and his national salvation front came to power after the 
revolution and were confirmed in the may elections the government 
has used force to break up some demonstrations since then

an animal rights group has won a court 
order against a navy program to kill squirrels at a weapons 
station the group claims the chemical bait used also threatens 
endangered species 
us district judge thelton henderson on friday granted a 
temporary restraining order to the contra costa county chapter of 
in defense of animals 
the group sued the navy in federal court contending a squirrel 
control program was started at the concord naval weapons station 
without an environmental impact report 
contra costa county paid for half the poisoned grain but was not 
named in the lawsuit the county has sponsored an eradication 
program for years that has not been challenged in court 
the navy began the eradication program monday because neighbors 
of the base complained squirrels were damaging property and 
buildings and because the animals burrowed into ammunition bunkers 
said assistant us attorney james coda respresenting the navy 
about five tons of oats containing the anticoagulant 
chlorophacinone were spread over 800 acres of the navys 
12900acre station north of concord before the ban was imposed 
the animal rights group claims the poison threatens endangered 
species that live in in the area east of san francisco bay such as 
the san joaquin kit fox and salt harvest mouse 
predatory birds such as owls and golden eagles also could die 
after eating the poisoned squirrels said maryanne britten an 
attorney for the group 
the temporary ban lasts until oct 22 when henderson will hold 
another hearing to decide whether to extend it 
in defense of animals also contend the program is cruel because 
the poison causes the california ground squirrels to bleed 
internally and die slowly said spokeswoman jean bonadio 
henderson ordered the group to raise a 10000 bond by early 
next week as a condition of granting the temporary stay the bond 
would cover the navys losses if the animals rights group fails to 
win its case 
the navy paid contra costa county 10000 for the poisoned 
grain since last may the county has sold the bait to landowners 
at a 50 percent price discount before that it provided the 
poisoned grain for free but began sharing the cost because of 
increased requests 
john defremery the countys agricultural commissioner said 
about 35 tons of poisoned oats have been used on about 35000 acres 
of county rangeland this year

european and nasa officials exuded joy 
saturday after the shuttle discovery launched the ulysses probe 
they control from california on a great adventure to explore 
the suns poles 
ive never enjoyed an experience like ive enjoyed this one 
never have i known you could feel so good for so long said 
willis meeks ulysses project manager at nasas jet propulsion 
laboratory 
derek eaton ulysses project manager for the european space 
agency declared welcome to sunny california its a sunny day 
for me today 
discovery lifted off from cape canaveral fla saturday 
morning six hours later ulysses was deployed from the shuttles 
cargo bay in the next 83 minutes three rocket stages boosted 
ulysses out of earth orbit starting it on a roundabout fiveyear 
mission to explore the suns polar regions at a cost of 750 
million 
the national aeronautics and space administrations deep space 
network tracking station in canberra australia picked up ulysses 
signal at 1218 pm pdt the spacecraft seemed to be in perfect 
working order eaton said 
ulysses is a joint project of nasa and esa the europeans will 
control ulysses from the jet propulsion laboratory while nasa 
officials will provide tracking and other ground support 
ulysses voyage will take it past jupiter in february 1992 when 
it will use that planet as a gravity slingshot to become the 
first spacecraft to fly a path perpendicular to the plane in which 
the planets orbit the sun 
that will allow ulysses to pass over the suns south polar 
regions during mayseptember 1994 and over the north polar 
latitudes during mayseptember 1995 
this is a great adventure in virgin territory said edgar 
page esas ulysses science coordinator 
yet ulysses will never get closer to the sun than when it was 
launched from the shuttle at its closest approach ulysses will be 
120 million miles from the sun earth is 93 million miles from the 
sun 
page said there is no need for ulysses to get any closer to 
achieve its goal of studying the suns high latitudes 
to send the spacecraft closer would have raised difficult design 
problems since ulysses would have to withstand intense solar heat 
but also survive deep cold near jupiter 
because no spacecraft ever has studied the suns high latitudes 
our present understanding of the sun could be compared to trying 
to make a map of the earth by flying an airplane around the 
equator esa said in a news release 
ulysses carries nine scientific instruments and its radio will 
conduct two other studies the experiments will study solar wind 
cosmic rays and dust gamma rays xrays solar magnetic fields and 
a vast array of energetic particles spewed by the sun 
esa said there is no body in heaven as important to us as the 
sun even a tiny change in its health could cause an ice age or 
could melt the ice caps flooding the coasts of the world 
variations in solar cycles have had an impact on the radical 
climate changes seen in the past 
willy brado esas assistant director for operations said 
saturdays launch will help restore the confidence of european 
governments in manned space flights for deploying scientific 
spacecraft 
if this had failed it would have had repercussions at esa 
he said

students at the university of the district of 
columbia saturday relinquished control of an administrative 
building and ended a 10day protest after school officials agreed 
to most of their demands 
following several allday negotiation sessions the board agreed 
to 35 of 44 demands including amnesty for the activists student 
leader mark thompson said 
the students took over a campus services building on sept 26 to 
press their demands for improvements in academic and athletic 
programs and the resignation of the 11 members of the 15member 
board of trustees appointed by washington mayor marion barry 
as many as 500 students occupied the building during the 
protest which forced cancellation of classes for several days on 
the northwest washington campus 
thompson said students compromised on the final demand that the 
11 trustees resign the trustees had said their resignation would 
create confusion at the campus of 12000 and do more harm than 
good 
a city council committee is expected to consider a bill that 
would increase board membership to 21 including two students 
barry who earlier abandoned negotiations with the students 
because of the lack of progress told a gathering of students and 
school and city officials saturday that all sides would benefit 
from the strike 
this is a historic and proud moment in the history of udc udc 
is and will become an even a greater university because of what our 
students did and what they did and stood for said the mayor 
both trustees and students pledged they would continue to try to 
improve student services and provide a better education at the 
citysubsidized institution 
the pact does not include any immediate changes committees of 
students and administrators are to be set up to examine such issues 
as constructing a student union and creating a computerized music 
library

the executive producer of abcs 2020 
acknowledged saturday that the television show was duped by an 
impostor claiming to be buckwheat from the classic our gang 
comedies 
william billy thomas the actor who played buckwheat died 
nearly a decade ago 
on 2020 friday night hugh downs narrated a segment in 
which the series claimed to have found buckwheat working as a 
grocery bagger in tempe ariz the impostor bill english said he 
had changed his last name from thomas and refused to sign 
autographs because it would interfere with his work 
2020 spokeswoman maurie perl said saturday that thomas 
obituaries proved english was a fake and the show would apologize 
during its next broadcast friday 
executive producer victor neufeld feels indeed there was a 
lapse in the research done by the production team and we may very 
well have made a mistake ms perl said obviously we are upset 
and dismayed with the mistake 
thomas friends and family said they were angry the impostor 
received a national television audience 
thomas died oct 10 1980 of a heart attack at age 49 said his 
son william thomas jr of covina calif 
the elder thomas appeared in 89 our gang films starting in 
1934 when he was 3 years old until the series ended in 1944 
i just cant believe 2020 didnt investigate this better 
im somewhat dumbfounded by the whole thing bill thomas said 
saturday 
we did not mean to cause any pain or unpleasantness for any of 
buckwheats family or friends ms perl said with regard to 
the production team obviously they will be reprimanded and that 
will be handled internally thomas who runs buckwheat 
enterprises and makes a living licensing the character said 
impostors threaten his business he has filed several lawsuits to 
protect the name 
george mcfarland 62 the child star who played buckwheats 
sidekick spanky said he spoke saturday with neufeld and the 
producer was terribly concerned about what had happened 
mcfarland who lives in fort worth said he too has been dogged by 
impostors 
richard w bann who cowrote the 1976 book our gang the life 
and times of the little rascals with leonard maltin said the 
error hurt the abc news magazine shows credibility 
what kind of research is this you would think that at this 
level of investigative reporting you would catch something like 
this he said from his los angeles home it sort of undermines 
anything youll ever see on that show again and next week theyll 
find elvis 
a tempe viewer suggested the profile said ms perl 
i dont believe in the 12 years of the broadcast we have ever 
had such a problem and we will without question tighten all 
research and review processes she said 
the our gang series which included 221 short films and one 
of feature length began in 1922 with the dual billing hal roach 
presents his rascals in their latest our gang comedy titled 
the term little was added to rascals when the films were 
broadcast on television beginning in 1955 
the series starred several child actors including robert blake 
and jackie cooper the kids had a pit bull named pete the pup 
with a circle painted around one eye 
a year to the day after thomas died eddie murphy began his 
parody of an adult buckwheat on nbcs saturday night

a senior british official said 
saturday he foresaw no problems of coordination between us 
marines and a british armored unit soon to be placed under the 
marines operational control 
we wouldnt anticipate any great trouble there armed forces 
minister archibald hamilton told a news conference compatible 
equipment including communications gear is one advantage of 
working with our nato allies he said 
britains 7th armored brigade with about 7000 troops and 120 
advanced challenger tanks is being shifted from its base in 
germany in the biggest movement of british armored forces since 
world war ii the unit is named the desert rats for its legacy of 
battle in north africa 
hamilton the secondranking official in the british defense 
ministry said he expected the brigade to be in place by early 
november alongside us marine units that have been in the country 
for six weeks 
us officials here have refused to comment on the arrangement 
hamilton said the combining of the two forces has been proposed 
by american commanders who were very glad when they heard the 
7th armored brigade was coming 
in fact they said they would like to see 7th brigade 
enhancing the capability of the marines and thats where we seem 
to fit in most neatly 
the challenger tanks equipped with 120mm guns and what british 
experts claim is the worlds best armor are more modern than the 
marines m60 tanks 
it is certainly up to anything that the iraqis can field it 
is superior to anything the iraqis have hamilton said 
he acknowledged the challenger had been plagued with 
difficulties but said there was no basis for reports that they 
would be used only as static artillery to support marine 
operations 
the current british deployment which includes aircraft 
warships and 5000 personnel is costing a million pounds 191 
million a day and that will double when the armored brigade 
arrives hamilton said 
he said there was an argument between the defense ministry 
and the british treasury on how the costs are to be covered but 
discussions were under way toward getting the saudi government to 
underwrite some of the cost as it has done with the us forces

authorities began a form of 
gasoline rationing on saturday to deal with dwindling supplies of 
soviet oil as winter approaches 
the new regulations which took effect at midnight friday limit 
drivers to 25 liters or about six gallons of gasoline in october 
at the official price of about 3 a gallon any amount above the 
limit carries about a 1 surcharge per gallon new limits for 
november were to be announced later 
for three days before the rationing went into effect drivers 
overwhelmed filling stations trying to buy as much gasoline as 
possible some slept in their cars overnight waiting for the 
stations to open 
panic buying started wednesday night after announcements that 
czechoslovak leaders were seeking urgent talks with soviet 
president mikhail gorbachev and premier nikolai ryzhkov about 
soviet oil supplies 
the price of gasoline already increased by 50 percent in july 
because of dwindling supplies from the soviet union 
the soviet union for years the main supplier of subsidized oil 
to czechoslovakia and its east european neighbors has been unable 
to fulfill quotas it will begin demanding convertible currency for 
the oil starting next year 
many of the countries in eastern europe also have lost supplies 
of iraqi oil beccause of their support for the un sanctions 
against iraqi leader saddam hussein their fragile economies are 
facing much higher prices on the world market 
economics minister vladimir dlouhy estimated last week that 
czechoslovakia would lose about 14 billion in extra fuel costs as 
a result of the gulf crisis 
soviet authorities said earlier they would reduce oil allotments 
for czechoslovakia originally set at 166 million tons for 1990 
by an estimated 26 million but czechoslovak authorities say the 
cuts are even greater

the pilot and at least 147 other victims of 
the lockerbie disaster may have survived the bomb blast that ripped 
the plane apart at 31000 feet and died when they hit the ground a 
forensic pathologist said 
and theres a good possibility they were conscious said dr 
william g eckert director of the milton helpern international 
center of forensic sciences at wichita state university eckert has 
performed thousands of autopsies and consulted on hundreds of cases 
involving medicallegal issues 
pan am flight 103 was ripped apart by a bomb on dec 21 1988 
over southern scotland whether any of the 259 victims survived the 
fall to the ground could be a crucial point in lawsuits seeking 
payment for the victims pain and suffering 
eckert said the 148 lockerbie victims who landed on or near 
tundergoth hill may have lost consciousness because of lack of 
oxygen when the boeing 747 exploded but would have revived at about 
15000 to 10000 feet 
he said the victims would have been aware of what was happening 
for the final third of their 36second fall 
eckert said testimony thursday at a public inquiry in dumfries 
scotland supported his opinions a rescuer said she found a young 
woman who had a weak but regular pulse shortly after the bodies 
rained from the sky 
in a memo to scottish police investigator john orr eckert said 
several of the passengers apparently had prepared for their deaths 
some clutched crosses or crucifixes and one woman held her baby 
tight 
a woman aboard a yugoslavian airliner that collided with a 
british jetliner in 1976 survived a 38000foot fall eckert said 
german plots during world war ii who crashed and died at the 
controls of their planes suffered injuries similar to those 
inflicted on the flights pilot he said 
there was a mark on the thumb of the right hand of the pilot 
that suggests the pilot was holding the yoke of the plane on impact 
and was alive and holding on for dear life eckert said 
eckerts comments came in a friday interview the memo he wrote 
to orr and an article he wrote for the american journal of forensic 
medicine and pathology the professional journal of the national 
association of medical examiners the report was published in the 
quarterlys fall issue 
eckert toured the crash site and investigation centers about 
five months after the crash he wrote the confidential memo to orr 
shortly after the visit and gave a copy friday to the associated 
press 
eckert viewed the five main areas where bodies and debris fell 
saw some bodies and talked to pathologists 
autopsy records and remains could help determine who survived 
the blast he said

elections for the body that picks irans 
spirital leader are threatening to aggravate a simmering feud 
between president hashemi rafsanjanis government and his radical 
rivals 
the hardliners accuse the current spiritual leader ayatollah 
ali khamenei of backing rafsanjani and rigging the elections to 
exclude radical candidates from the 83member assembly of experts 
they say mondays popular vote must be postponed 
the antiwestern radicals have been on the defensive since the 
death of their revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah 
khomeini in june 1989 
they fear a purge by rafsanjani who has tried to mend bridges 
with the west after more than a decade of hostility they suffered 
a further blow last week when tehran resumed relations with britain 
after an 18month break 
radical leaders believe such ties will dilute khomeinis zealous 
1979 revolution which overthrew the prowestern shah mohammad reza 
pahlavi and replaced him with the islamic republic 
the tugofwar between the two factions though officially 
denied has never been far from the public eye but it also has 
never been as public as it has recently 
fistfights erupted in the radicaldominated parliament or 
majlis during a debate on the issue last week sources in tehran 
said on condition of anonymity 
the government radio broadcasting the heated debate live 
abruptly went off the air when the fighting started the sources 
said 
the radicals reportedly threatened to stage protest rallies in 
tehran on monday diplomatic sources in tehran said saturday the 
situation was tense 
jolted by a warning from khamenei against allowing the feud to 
boil over tehran radio said hundreds of radical organizations 
and personalities had pledged their support for the government 
the revolutionary guards irans main fighting force which is 
believed dominated by radical sympathizers warned hardliners not 
to widen the divisions inside the tehran hierarchy 
but the mujahedeen khalq an opposition group based in iraq 
said in a statement saturday that many of the revolutionary guards 
who maintain law and order are themselves against the elections 
because their ideological allies have been dumped 
the radicals angered by khameneis support for rafsanjani in 
his campaign to ease the governments hold on the economy and move 
closer to the west have aimed their criticism at him 
led by former interior minister ali akbar mohtashemi the 
hardliners have accused khamenei of lacking the qualifications for 
leadership 
khamenei 51 a middleranking cleric was overwelmingly chosen 
by the assembly of experts to replace khomeini overnight he was 
promoted to ayatollah the highest clerical rank in the shiite 
moslem hierarchy 
but sources in tehran said on condition of anonymity that the 
hardliners were seeking to win enough seats in the assembly of 
experts to depose khamenei and replace him with a 
radicalcontrolled leadership council 
to preempt that khamenei several weeks ago ordered his allies 
on the council of guardians to pass a new law requiring candidates 
to sit for an examination before they can run for the assembly the 
council screens parliamentary legislation to ensure it conforms 
with islamic principles 
out of 169 candidates who took the exam 60 failed sources said 
most were radicals including parliament speaker mehdi karrubi 
some radicals refused to sit for the examinations three 
hardliners who did pass later withdrew their names in protest 
in a cabinet meeting wednesday rafsanjani denied any move to 
sideline his radical opposition tehran radio reported 
there is no such thought either in the mind of the leader or 
the guardian council nor do others think like this he said 
the mujahedeen statement said that in wednesdays parliament 
session sadegh khalkhali a vehement radical attacked the 
guardian council and said if it has been decided that we are to 
be cast aside tell us officially 
he warned we will stand by our words until the very last drop 
of our blood

european finance chiefs on saturday 
approved britains longawaited decision to enter the pound into 
their exchange rate linkage giving a fresh push to efforts to 
unite their nations economies 
the finance officials said britains surprise move marked a 
significant advance in forging closer economic and monetary links 
among the 12 nations of the european community trading bloc 
british prime minister margaret thatcher sharply reversed 
longstanding economic policy to let the pound join the system 
which is heavily influenced by the strong german mark 
she so far has resisted radical plans that would quickly lead to 
a common currency and a central bank for the community nations 
the economic project would give an added dimension to the 
trading blocs campaign to tear down by the end of 1992 the many 
trade barriers preventing the free flow of people money goods and 
services among the nations it will create a vast consumer market 
of more than 330 million people 
the move to add the pound to the exchange rate mechanism of the 
european monetary system was unlikely have an impact on the us 
dollar which is not part of the arrangement 
the exchange rate mechanism seeks to prevent wide shifts in 
exchange rates of the member nations and keep inflation and 
interest rates under control 
central banks are required to prevent their currencies from 
falling outside certain ranges by intervening buying and selling 
currencies in the exchange markets 
in a statement the finance chiefs announced acceptance of 
britains proposal to tie the pound to the mechanism on monday with 
a central rate of 295 german marks it will be allowed to swing 6 
percent above or below that figure for an unspecified 
transitional period said the statement 
the spanish peseta the last currency to join the system in june 
1989 also swings in a 6 percent range all the other currencies 
move in a narrower band of 225 percent last january the italian 
government narrowed the range for the lira from 6 percent to 225 
percent 
with the pounds addition the currencies of 10 community 
nations belgium britain denmark france germany ireland 
italy luxembourg the netherlands and spain will be linked in 
the exchange rate mechanism only the currencies of portugal and 
greece remain outside the link 
carlos tavares secretary of state at the portuguese treasury 
predicted his countrys escudo would be the next to join sometime 
before 1993 
in their statement the finance ministers and central bank 
governors said they considered the british move a strengthened 
commitment by the british authorities to pursue a firm 
antiinflationary policy 
mrs thatcher had said she would not allow the pound to join the 
linkage until britains inflation rate dropped closer to the 
european average of about 5 percent 
after fridays announcement she said she made her decision 
because the countrys doubledigit inflation rate was on the verge 
of falling being part of the arrangement she said would 
underpin our antiinflationary stance 
the currency linkage is the first stage of a threepart plan for 
creating an economic and monetary union in later stages a single 
currency and a europeanwide central bank would be created modeled 
after the us federal reserve 
britain recently has gained support for its goslow approach to 
monetary union because of worries about the economic impact of the 
persian gulf crisis the surge in oil prices and inflation could 
make it harder to merge the different economies 
even so the community will open a special conference in 
middecember to make changes in its founding treaty so new economic 
agencies can be set up

there arent many happy 
campers in yosemite national park this weekend 
on a beautiful indian summer afternoon saturday with the 
leaves turning color and the meadows filled with vacationers the 
news that all campsites would be shut down triggered anger and 
disappointment 
some blamed congress some president bush but none of the 7000 
campers liked it when national park service officials told them 
they had to clear out by 1 pm sunday because of the budget crisis 
in washington 
bush has ordered nonessential federal government agencies 
across the nation closed in the absence of a budget agreement 
i think its horrible said becky vaccarezza of stockton 
who months ago made reservations for a weeklong vacation with five 
other adults and six children 
when youre at home you deal with the bills and everything 
but when you come up here this is everybodys escape this is how 
youre supposed to get away from budgets she said its a 
major disappointment we had so many plans for the kids 
this was to be the last big weekend of the year at yosemite 
the final days of its centennial celebration before rangers start 
preparing the campgrounds for winter instead of relaxing and 
enjoying the magnificent views of half dome and el capitan many 
visitors worried about packing up sunday morning and finding 
somewhere to stay 
the ahwahnee hotel yosemite lodge and other facilities operated 
by the curry co will remain open as will the visitors center with 
a reduced staff 
but the park service canceled nature walks saturday sent 
interpretive rangers home and closed the centennial exhibit and 
indian cultural museum in this park east of san francisco near the 
nevada state line 
yosemite superintendent michael finley said interior department 
officials in washington told him to curtail all operations except 
emergency services 
theres no authority for me to spend money finley said 
the irony of it is that the shutdown is very expensive 
seasonal workers let go would have helped the national park 
service rangers prepare yosemite for winter he said adding that 
it would cost more money in the long run to have rangers do that 
work alone 
yosemite evacuated 15000 visitors this summer because of fires 
but this was the first time people have been told to go home 
because the us government had run out of money 
this is a real letdown said tom figlio on vacation from 
his home in new jersey i always wanted to see yosemite its 
very discouraging

delivering a message from president mikhail gorbachev 
about 5000 soviets have been prevented from leaving iraq since 
the invasion although they are not among the westerners being held 
as guests at hotels and strategic sites in an iraqi effort to 
deter western attack 
hundreds of thousands of foreigners have fled iraq and kuwait 
since the invasion and un and jordanian officials fear 80000 
more refugees may arrive in jordan this week 
in amman un undersecretarygeneral mohammad essaafi said the 
uns disaster relief agency and jordanian authorities are 
preparing food stockpiles to feed 120000 more people essaafi said 
the agency also is buying 7600 winter tents to replace the summer 
tents now set up in refugee camps around the country 
if theres a worsening of the situation in iraq and kuwait we 
might expect an increased flow of evacuees particularly egyptian 
nationals who might cross in very large numbers he added 
some 422400 refugees mainly egyptian and asians have been 
flown out of jordan in more than 1798 flights by military and 
civilian aircraft since aug 5 jordanian civil aviation officials 
said

president bush successfully vetoed legislation 
saturday to restore the governments ability to spend money and 
presided over the gradual shutdown of nonessential services in a 
confrontation spawned by deadlock over the federal deficit 
negotiators from the white house and congress resumed 
negotiations on a package of spending cuts and tax increases that 
could win approval and end the impasse but not before sunday 
night at the earliest 
but in the meantime the president said he would no longer abide 
business as usual by the democraticcontrolled congress he 
vetoed a bill that would have permitted the government to operate 
normally for another week and a few hours later the house failed 
to override the veto 
the 260138 vote override was six short of the twothirds 
majority required on the vote 235 democrats and 25 republicans 
voted to overturn bushs veto and nine democrats and 129 
republicans voted to uphold it 
responsible congressional action to reduce the deficit can be 
delayed no longer bush said in his veto message 
democrats denounced the presidents decision unnecessary 
unjustified and harmful said house speaker thomas s foley 
dwash 
but under the eyes of tourists packing the visitors galleries 
because many federal tourist attractions in town were closed the 
house mustered only the 260 votes to override well short of the 
twothirds vote needed 
reflecting the importance of the budget fight and lawmakers 
recent spate of long hours the debate was unusually acrimonious 
mr speaker there are snakes loose in the chamber shouted 
rep robert dornan rcalif after democrats hissed during the 
reading of bushs veto message 
but republicans were hissing moments later after rep richard 
durbin dill said bushs veto resulted in treating 2 million 
federal workers like saddam hussein treats his socalled guests in 
iraq 
feelings ran so high that angry conservative republicans blocked 
an effort by leaders of both parties to recess the house for two 
hours so lawmakers could have dinner while budget negotiators tried 
to work out a compromise 
at the white house spokesman roman popadiuk said we are 
pleased that the house has sustained the veto it is now time for 
the house to get on with dealing with the budget 
both the house and senate adjourned for the evening after the 
house vote which made any senate override action moot but 
scheduled sunday afternoon sessions to be available to consider any 
new budget proposals bush meanwhile motored to camp david for 
the night 
the federal shutdown presumably would increase pressure on the 
negotiators trying to piece together a plan to replace the 
fiveyear 500 billion package of tax increases and spending cuts 
that was defeated in the house after midnight thursday night 
house gop leader bob michel of illinois said he hoped congress 
and the white house could break the gridlock before the end of the 
threeday columbus day weekend when millions of federal workers 
face the threat of furloughs 
there was no immediate word from congressional leaders on their 
next move one possible step was to pass legislation replenishing 
the governments coffers but coupled with acrosstheboard 
spending cuts mandated by the grammrudman antideficit law bush 
hinted he might accept such a measure which would give negotiators 
time to craft a larger deficitreduction package 
the earlier deficitreduction plan went down in a crescendo of 
criticism with republicans expressing anger over tax hikes and 
democrats rebelling over 60 billion in cuts in the medicare 
program that pays for health care for the elderly 
bush and the democratic leaders of congress had jointly forged 
that agreement and the president said he still supported it 
but at the same time his decision to veto the shortterm 
funding bill and proceed with the shutdown of nonessential 
government services meant a highstakes political showdown was 
unfolding with the democratic majorities of congress 
asked how long he was willing to keep government doors locked 
he replied 
its not a question of how long i can take it bush said 
its a question of how long congress can take it congress is 
where the action is 
the white house last week estimated the fiscal 1991 budget 
deficit would be about 294 billion the budget agreement the house 
rejected would have cut the deficit 40 billion this year and 500 
billion over five years 
bush said he was very sorry if anyone was inconvenienced by 
the shutdown which was felt first at the washington monument 
lincoln memorial smithsonian museums and popular sites in the 
nations capital 
in fact the early disruptions were minimal confined largely to 
government tourist attractions 
the full impact of the shutdown of nonessential services was 
not likely to be felt until after mondays columbus day holiday for 
federal workers and the administration said it had the authority 
to maintain essential services such as the military air traffic 
safety control and prison control 
despite his criticism aimed at congress bush seemed to offer 
the possibility for a fresh compromise on taxes 
he refused to dismiss reporters questions that in return for 
cuts in the capital gains tax a 1988 bush campaign promise he 
might accept democrats demands for higher income taxes on the 
wealthy 
i remain in a flexible frame of mind the president said 
neither item was included in the deficitreduction package that 
bush agreed to last weekend with congressional leaders 
the capital gains tax levied on profits from sales of real 
estate and other property is now the same as for other income 
with a top 33 percent rate bush has proposed slashing that rate to 
15 percent arguing it would spur sales and feed cash into the 
economy 
but democrats arguing that most of the tax break would be 
enjoyed by the wealthy have insisted that income tax rates on the 
rich be raised as a tradeoff 
dropping the two tax changes was the last major hurdle the two 
sides cleared in their four contentious months of negotiations 
that plan was soundly rejected by a rebellious house early 
friday as majorities of rankandfile republicans and democrats 
turned on their own party leaders 
the stunning 254179 defeat came despite the most intense 
lobbying campaign of bushs presidency and equally allout efforts 
by top lawmakers of both parties 
some gop representatives still had bitter tastes in their mouths 
from the white house armtwisting accusing chief of staff john 
sununu and budget director richard darman of particularly gruff 
behavior 
your staff did a lot of insensitive and unnecessary things to 
republican members rep jim lightfoot riowa wrote saturday in 
a letter to bush bring millie but leave the pit dogs at the 
white house 
many lawmakers were alienated by the packages costs to poor and 
middleincome people including medicare cuts and tax hikes on 
homeheating oil and gasoline

germanys president richard von weizsacker in 
a special message to the israeli people said saturday that his 
country will always remember its responsibility for the holocaust 
and the six million jewish victims 
something terrible has been done in the name of the germans 
the gravest and the most terrible crime ever committed the 
holocaust its memory lives with us as part of our hope for the 
future and i hope that our obligations towards the past and our 
aspirations towards peace in the future will be understood in 
israel too von weizsacker said 
his remarks were carried in an israel television broadcast he 
said responsibility for the holocaust would be shared by all in the 
new germany 
as we unite as germans something that has been divided is 
also reuniting namely the bearing of responsibility for the 
results of our history von weizsacker said i am convinced 
that the young generation in east germany which has now united 
with us in the west is aware of the responsibility for the results 
of history 
the television said von weizsacker made the statement in 
response to a written appeal from israels president chaim herzog 
israel founded in 1948 as a jewish homeland largely in response 
to holocaust accepted germanys unification with a heavy heart 
there have been two parts of germany one a democratic state 
that has accepted the historic responsibility and historic guilt 
and has been close to israel in many fields and east germany 
which has been hostile towards israel said herzog who also 
spoke on the television

a busload of tourists from indiana drove six hours to reach the 
great smoky mountain national park nnly to be turned away by 
rangers saturday at clingmans dome the highest point in the park 
its really unfair to rub this in the peoples face this is 
really not helping relations with the public i would suspect if 
they wanted to get in the good graces of the people they would 
work for free for one day said bob davenport director for the 
weekend tour arranged by wandering wheels tour company from upland 
ind at the park visitors center eddie christensen of napa 
calif a retired corps of engineers employee said i definitely 
feel like george bush is doing this to make congress see his way i 
dont see why they should make the people suffer for it its 
politics no question about it 
in montana closed signs went up on the gates at the custer 
battlefield national monument and the national bison range but few 
other effects of the national budget impasse were immediately 
visible visitors could still enter both places as well as glacier 
and yellowstone national parks but few or no services were 
available 
at yosemite national park in california some 7000 campers 
were told they would have to clear out by 1 pm sunday because of 
the budget crisis i think its horrible said becky vaccarezza 
of stockton who months ago had made reservations for a weeklong 
vacation with five other adults and six children when youre at 
home you deal with the bills and everything but when you come up 
here this is everybodys escape this is how youre supposed to 
get away from budgets its a major disappointment we had so many 
plans for the kids yosemite superintendent michael finley said 
he was told by interior department officials in washington not to 
close the park but to curtail all operations except emergency 
services 
elsewhere in california the budget crisis also caused a 
shutdown of other popular venues in california including alcatraz 
muir woods and stinson beach in the golden gate national recreation 
area in northern california and the joshua tree and death valley 
national monuments in southern california odette zwetzig acting 
superintendent of death valley national monument said ive been 
with the park service for over 15 years i have seen shutdowns 
but i have not seen quite the hullabaloo that is going on with 
this one ive been around long enough to know that eventually 
theyll pass a budget in the meantime the tourists are very 
sad theyve come so far and theyve made their plans for a 
vacation and there are no services we can offer 
in michigan the budget stalemate was having an impact in the 
deepest woods where park rangers and naturalists were among 
victims layoffs were reported at the pictured rocks national

visitor center was open saturday but scheduled to close sunday and 
monday said julie fosbender an information assistant for the

and guides absent at national park service sites across the state 
we stopped here especially to see the treasures of philadelphia 
and theyre closed to us said dee gilmore 67 of riverside

think this is a sad way for president bush to try to get his own 
way andrea vogel 10 of washington dc who was traveling 
with her parents and brother said we came to see the history of 
philadelphia and i dont think its fair that they should close 
down the tourist sites why would people want to come to

state jerry eubanks supervisor of the gulf islands national 
seashore headquartered in gulf breeze said the park that includes 
barrier islands and mainland recreation areas in the florida 
panhandle and mississippi will remain open we have looked at 
alternatives he said weve just refreshed in our own minds 
what are essential health and safety measures but we have no plans 
as of now for shutting down 
in connecticut the shutdown and wrangling in washington had 
little effect on services but forced the states congressional 
leaders to cancel their campaign stops in the state saturday for 
incumbents trying to get in some campaigning in the final stretch 
before the election in november losing a chance to campaign at 
town fairs and parades throughout the state was frustrating i 
just cant tell you what its like to know your opponent is out 
there campaigning and you cant do anything said republican rep 
christopher shays who faces a challenge from attorney alfred j 
smith a democrat from darien 
in iowa hundreds of visitors were touring the herbert hoover

national park service as to why were open today and the 
national park service is not i dont know said chris 
christensen a sales clerk in the library and museum 
in nebraska many federal employees nervously enjoyed their 
threeday weekend i probably should be worried but im not 
said doug druliner a hydrologist with the us geological survey 
weve gone through this thing in the past but there was not as 
much hype about it weve had furloughs in the past and been paid 
later jim kula a service representative with the social 
security department agreed but this is the first time they were 
required to give us a formal 30day warning that there might be 
furloughs he added

to remain open through the weekend anzelmo said there is a 
snowstorm here and we dont want to strand visitors she said 
later in the weekend we may have to start further closures we 
hope we dont have to close down completely because 
yellowstone is so large and has a large visitor population we just 
cant simply shut a gate and walk away

supporters to lead the procession to avoid a threatened 
demonstration 
means whose backers carried signs denouncing christopher 
columbus as a murderer called the concession by the citys

afterward the group passed around a eremonial pipe at the 
state capitol and made plans to rally at the christopher columbus 
statue in civic center park on monday

parade because he has called columbus a genocidal killer on a par 
with adolf hitler last year means was arrested for pouring fake 
blood over the columbus statue 
but less than an hour before the parade began saturday bill 
marinella chairman of the parade committee said the indian

apparent suicide she was 57 
police said friday that mrs shelton died thursday night from an 
apparently selfinflicted gunshot wound to the head family members 
said she left a note at her home professing her love for her five 
children but it did not mention her husband or offer an

her husband being the last pow i think she said i just cant

washington 
shelton then a captain was shot down over laos on april 23 
1965 and captured a few days later 
a pentagon spokesman lt cmdr edward lundquist was quoted 
this summer as saying the military believed shelton died in the 
1960s from malaria or dysentery 
but the us government made shelton a symbol promoting him 
leaving him on the official rolls as a pow and sending an active 
duty pay check to his wife every month 
the about 2500 other men unaccounted for in southeast asia have 
been listed as presumed dead 
for 25 years mrs shelton pressured legislators for help 
traveled the world seeking information about her husband and 
appeared on numerous radio and television programs urging the 
government to provide more answers to families of the missing 
family members said she had been depressed recently but believed 
in the pow cause to her dying breath 
she knows one way or another now sisterinlaw faye newcom 
said in a telephone interview from owensboro ky either hes up 
there with her or she knows where hes at maybe she can do more 
good up there

them said retired navy capt red mcdaniel a pow for six years 
but her death will strengthen the resolve of a lot of people

steadily and cubas economy is ailing

an undercover police drug sting operation 
unofficially dubbed operation al jolson because white 
detectives wore blackface makeup netted 30 arrests but was branded 
racist by black community leaders 
police halted the practice in the mostly black neighborhood of 
river park after news reports brought complaints but officials 
defended its use 
because the sales are made predominantly by blacks theres 
no way detectives could get out there and sell drugs standing on 
the corner looking the way they were naples police capt kevin 
rambosk said recently 
the department in the southwestern florida city of about 18000 
residents has one black on a force of about 75 officers the 
neighboring collier county sheriffs department has 10 blacks on a 
force of 407 officers 
the shortage of black officers is no excuse for the racial 
masquerade a black leader said 
the police seemed to be saying this is what a drug pusher 
would look like said fran haugabrook in other words a drug 
pusher is black it is offensive 
the naples daily news published a package of stories in august 
about the controversial police technique shortly thereafter a 
group of 249 residents demanded an investigation by the fbi and the 
attorneys general for florida and the united states 
recently newsweek magazine carried a short but sharply worded 
item on the blackface antidrug tactic they dubbed operation al 
jolson

both explosions came after the rebel leader col alexander 
noble surrendered and gave up his threeday secessionist revolt on 
mindanao island 
the mutiny was crushed after troops loyal to president corazon 
aquino bombed an army camp seized by rebels in butuan city 500 
miles southeast of manila noble who took over another camp in 
neighboring cagayan de oro province 500 miles to the south gave 
up saturday and was flown to manila 
hours after nobel surrendered a bomb destroyed two jeeps and 
injured one person outside defense secretary fidel ramos office at 
camp aguinaldo a few yards where noble was being detained 
chief of staff gen renato de villa said rebel soldiers may have 
set off that blast to get even with the recent blow to renegade 
forces 
the second bombing on sunday hurt no one and destroyed a 
cement plant box outside the finance building 
police said both devices were the same type that rebel 
rightwing soldiers have been using in a series of bombings in the 
capital since midaugust 
guards closed the gates at the camp aguinaldo and barred anyone 
from entering or leaving the camp has been on alert since the 
revolt erupted thursday on mindanao island 
sundays blast was the 37th in the manila area since aug 13 in 
what the military believes is a terror campaign by rightist rebels 
the bombs raised fears of more attacks by military dissidents 
despite the failure of the seventh military rebellion during mrs 
aquinos 4yearold administration 
earlier saturday de villa said nobles arrest dealt a severe 
blow to elements in the military who aim to topple the struggling 
government 
mrs aquino told filipinos in a televised address that the 
constitution will be upheld with force if need be she also asked 
congress to enact legislation increasing the penalty for rebellion 
from six to 20 years imprisonment to life 
most filipinos have little sympathy for military rebels but the 
inability of the governmnt to control the dissidents has 
discredited a civilian administration that seems unable to deliver 
basic services control prices and guide national development 
that concern has been reflected in the business community which 
is already alarmed over the prospects of economic decline brought 
on by the persian gulf crisis and the effects a july earthquake 
that killed more than 1600 people 
on thursday nobles forces of about 800 soldiers civilians and 
militiamen seized a garrison in butuan about 70 miles east of 
cagayan de oro they were joined by about 150 elite scout rangers 
in iligan a major industrial center in northern mindanao 
they declared independence for the southern island in a move 
widely thought to be a prelude to an attack on the central 
government in manila 
the government crushed the revolt in part with bombing raids 
the uprising left one person dead one wounded and one missing 
military officials said 
officials said all garrisons were back in government hands 
saturday government forces were rounding up nobles followers and 
hundreds were already in custody authorities said 
noble was escorted to manila by brig gen arturo enrile 
superintendent of the philippine military academy and other armed 
forces officials 
defense secretary fidel ramos said nobles chief civilian ally 
reuben canoy also was arrested in cagayan de oro where he once 
served as mayor 
de villa blamed nobles defeat on the failure of his allies to 
come to his aid and instigate uprisings elsewhere in mindanao 
certainly the surrender of noble and the suppression of the 
pocket rebellion in northern mindanao will greatly weaken this 
movement which has been continuously bedeviling the country de 
villa said 
despite his surrender noble claimed he achieved his objectives 
of drawing attention to the problems of mindanao 
noble 42 was formerly chief of staff of mrs aquinos guard 
force but he turned against her and joined the coup attempt in 
december he later fled to the jungles of northern mindanao

the rebellious republics of croatia 
and slovenia published a document saturday demanding that 
yugoslavias federal system be refashioned into a loose 
confederation of sovereign states 
the document drafted by the leadership of the two republics 
both of which are politically centerright was published 
simultaneously in slovenia and coatia 
it proposed that the present six republics become 
semiindependent states that would cooperate only for common 
economic and political interests 
each member of this union of sovereign states would have its 
own army and currency and could secede at any time 
yugoslavia formed in 1918 has been a centralized federation 
since the communist takeover in 1945 it is governed by a 
collective presidency 
this balkan nation of 23 million people has been torn by 
traditional rivalries among various religious and ethnic groups 
heightening the tensions have been recent political conflicts 
between republics with democratically elected governments and those 
still ruled by communists 
the communist government in the largest republic of serbia 
strongly opposes turning yugoslavia into a confederation it 
advocates a modern federation with central rule remaining in 
belgrade 
slovenian president milan kucan has said the only alternative to 
confederation would be breaking up yugoslavia he indicated 
slovenia would otherwise secede or form a confederation with 
croatia 
serbias hardline president slobodan milosevic said recently 
that if yugoslavia becomes a confederation serbia would demand its 
borders be changed to include about 500000 serbs now living in 
croatia 
on friday a small national army unit occupied the headquarters 
of slovenias regional defense forces in ljubljana the slovenian 
capital in a bid to reassert federal authority

a trespassing charge against a roman 
catholic priest accused of blocking abortion clinic doors was 
dismissed after a jury was unable to reach a verdict in the case 
municipal court judge richard van dusen dismissed the charge 
against the rev george peter irving on friday after a jury 
deadlocked 111 in favor of conviction 
youre really dealing with a simple trespassing case that has 
larger moral issues thrown in van dusen said 
prosecutors unsuccessfully moved to retry the priest after van 
dusen declared a mistrial the judge said another jury was unlikely 
to reach a verdict either 
irving 37 was the first antiabortion activist in los angeles 
county permitted to use the socalled necessity defense which 
allows defendants to argue that they broke a law to prevent a 
higher evil 
irving associate pastor of church of the assumption was 
arrested dec 19 when 100 antiabortion protesters gathered 
outside clinica eva a family planning clinic in el monte 
in several hundred similar antiabortion trespassing cases 
prosecutors have successfully barred the necessity defense on 
grounds abortion is legal and therefore does not pose a 
significant evil that would warrant breaking the law 
the mistrial came as the archdiocese of los angeles and parishes 
around the country prepared for respect life sunday 
los angeles archbishop roger mahony urged all priests and 
deacons to preach special antiabortion sermons sunday and 
throughout the month 
operation rescue antiabortion leaders hailed the dismissal of 
charges as a victory for unborn children but abortion rights 
activists said the judges decision sent the wrong message 
this says its ok to be easy on a criminal just because hes 
wearing a collar said robin schneider executive director of the

listen up bachelors being single can be 
deadly according to a national study that says unmarried 
middleaged men are twice as likely to die as those who have 
spouses 
and dont think living together will save your lives 
even single men who live with someone other than a spouse have 
a higher death rate maradee davis primary author of the 
university study said friday it seems to be the presence of a 
spouse thats protective 
twentythree percent of men ages 45 to 54 who lived without a 
spouse died within 10 years compared to 11 percent of similarly 
aged men who lived with their wives according to the study by 
epidemiologists at the university of california at san francisco 
the study also found that 77 percent of women ages 45 to 54 who 
lived without a spouse died within 10 years compared to 4 percent 
of the married women in the same age group 
but overall womens risk was linked to low income not the type 
of living arrangement researchers said 
the study analyzed data compiled by the national health and 
nutrition examination survey the 7651 subjects from across the 
united states ranged in age from 45 to 74 and were studied from 
1971 to 1975 and then again from 1982 to 1984 
researchers theorize that both middleaged men and women died 
sooner than their married counterparts because of factors such as a 
poor diet alcohol consumption smoking a lack of exercise and low 
income 
marriage apparently breeds better living habits while the 
single life often includes more drinking smoking and perhaps too 
many beer nuts and party snacks and not enough square meals 
for men the health behavior factors tended to explain the 
difference in death rates said davis an associate professor 
of epidemiology in our society men generally are not able to 
take care of their everyday needs 
but for women a high proportion of those who are single head 
households and usually have low incomes 
researchers also said they believe that men dont have as much 
lifeenhancing social support as women outside of marriage 
men derive a lot of social support by being married but women 
have a more widespread social support system outside of marriage 
davis said 
davis said researchers began the study funded by the national 
institute on aging because of a concern about an increasing number 
of older adults living alone in the united states 
in the study group slightly more than half of women ages 65 to 
74 in the study were living alone or with someone other than a 
spouse compared to 19 percent of the men in the same age group 
because of the high divorce rate in the united states and the 
trend toward older adults choosing to live alone if they are 
widowed there is a general concern about the social isolation 
health and wellbeing of older adults living alone davis said 
davis presented the study thursday to the 118th annual meeting 
of the american public health association in new york city

much of the federal government shut down at 
midnight friday victim to a deepening budget standoff between the 
white house and congress 
the hour of reckoning is at hand president bush said in a 
statement friday night the president refused to sign or veto 
11thhour legislation passed by congress restoring the governments 
power to spend money choosing instead to let the shutdown 
commence 
the president simply feels we ought to quit fooling around 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said surely the reality 
of a government shutdown will convince everyone a solution should 
be found 
the budget dispute has prevented congress from approving any 
appropriations bills for the fiscal year that began monday 
effectively leaving the government with no money 
the us constitution states no money shall be drawn from the 
treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law 
only those services needed to protect life and property were 
to continue in the absence of a budget white house budget director 
richard darman wrote in a memo to agency chiefs 
with the long holiday weekend about to start it seemed likely 
that the full brunt of the shutdown would not be felt until 
tuesday but the park service was preparing to close the statue of 
liberty the washington monument and other tourist favorites at 
least for the weekend 
senate majority leader george mitchell criticized bush for his 
decision 
i believe it is inflicting needless pain and anguish on 
thousands of american families and i do not believe it is creating 
the kind of atmosphere that enhances the chances for an 
agreement said mitchell dmaine 
the senate sent the measure to bush on a voice vote friday 
night shortly after democrats rammed it through the house by a 
tally of 300113 the measure fully financing the government 
through next friday even got some republican support in the house 
the president has 10 days to sign or veto the bill but 
fitzwater said bush hoped to have a budget solution in hand 
before that 
i dont know what the answer is right now said rep silvio 
conte rmass but i do know one thing chaos is not the 
answer 
congress planned a saturday session and possible sessions 
throughout the threeday columbus day weekend because of the 
fiscal standoff 
the specter of federal agencies having no funds to operate arose 
after the house early friday resoundingly defeated a budget 
agreeent worked out by bush and congressional leaders 
as lawmakers began trying to put together new packages they 
revived talk of perhaps cutting the capital gains tax rate and 
raising income tax rates for the rich 
to boost pressure on budget writers to forge a spending plan for 
the fivedayold fiscal year white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said bush would not sign any such temporary financing 
bill 
we would close down the government at midnight friday unless 
congress completes a broad budget outline by then fitzwater said 
fitzwater said bush followed the debate in the house on cable 
television in the family living quarters at the white house 
most of the nations 24 million federal workers were told to 
report on tuesday after mondays federal holiday even if only 
to be sent home after they arrived 
congressional leaders of both parties met with administration 
officials to grope for a deficitcutting plan that would be 
acceptable to lawmakers just a month shy of election day 
democrats sought support for a new plan with fewer cuts for the 
elderly and the poor but there were no signs that republicans were 
willing to accept it 
democrats also said they would be willing to consider cuts in 
the capital gains tax rate a republican proposal in exchange for 
higher taxes for the rich budget negotiators had rejected the 
tradeoff last week 
earlier in a thursday night session that stretched into friday 
morning a rebellious house overwhelmingly defeated the 
500billion compromise package of tax boosts and spending slashes 
that bush and congressional leaders preferred 
that vote was an embarrassment to administration officials and 
top lawmakers of both parties who had waged an allout lobbying 
thrust on behalf of the measure uncertainty reigned on capitol 
hill 
this thing could be who knows said a confused rep robert 
matsui dcalif 
democrats hoped that by sending the emergency spending bill to 
bush the president and not congress would be blamed for the 
closure 
but lawmakers of both parties agreed that all sides looked bad 
in light of the seemingly endless budget battle 
rep jack buechner rmo tugged on a tie bearing a mickey 
mouse pattern and said everybody ought to have these on today 
the houses 254179 rejection of the budget was driven by 
unhappiness among members of all stripes conservatives disliked 
its 134 billion in taxes and as well as its spending cuts they 
considered overly gentle 
liberals thought the 60 billion in medicare reductions 
including cuts in benefits were too steep they said the plans 
higher levies on gasoline heating oil tobacco and alcohol would 
hit the poor too hard 
and members of both parties said they resented the process by 
which the package was written four months of closeddoor summit 
talks involving only congressional leaders and administration 
officials 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash said he believed that as 
a result lawmakers should try to write a budget themselves 
perhaps with reduced medicare cuts and a lesser tax burden for 
lowincome people 
we will of course keep in touch with the white house but i 
do not anticipate the resumption of anything that would be 
called summit talks he said 
foley said he wanted a budget that would be supported by a 
majority of democrats and republicans i am not of the opinion 
that political warfare is of some value at this point he said 
but not all lawmakers agreed conservative republicans urged 
bush to keep the government shut down until democrats agreed to 
limit federal spending 
a budget plan ought to be put together by the president in 
consultation with republicans said rep tom delay rtexas 
tell the democrats to put up their best shot well sustain every 
veto hes got

in the early 1970s robert mapplethorpe took his 
first photographs with a polaroid camera it was the perfect tool 
for radical art what was radical about his work was not so much 
the subject matter but the process and materials he applied to a 
stagnant form adding fabric texture tone 
form and technique however are not what spring to mind these 
days when considering the late artist today it is the rough 
images he immortalized oral sex bondage homosexual fondling 
that give him an important place in 20thcentury art 
perhaps mapplethorpe never fully realized his destiny as an 
artist he died in march 1989 at the age of 42 of complications 
from acquired immune deficiency syndrome in death he has become a 
symbol for artistic freedom 
on friday a jury acquitted the contemporary arts center in 
cincinnati and its director dennis barrie of pandering obscenity 
and using children in nudityrelated material 
the charges were prompted by the exhibit robert mapplethorpe 
the perfect moment which had a seven weekrun last spring and 
drew more than 80000 people an attendance record for an art 
exhibit in cincinnati the show closes this week in boston 
a mapplethorpe exhibit last year at the corcoran gallery of art 
in washington was canceled after sen jesse helms rnc declared 
some of the artists photographs to be obscene helms objections 
resulted in a move by congress to limit federal funds to the arts 
i wasnt starting out to make a statement that isnt the way 
i work mapplethorpe once said the statement grows out of what 
i do 
in his 197677 work bill mapplethorpe placed a mirror 
between two panels of a man masturbating the idea is to have the 
viewer seehhim or herself flanked by two erect penises 
he used the same technique in 1979s easter lilies with 
mirror here four panels form a cross around a center mirror 
the lilies are shown in dramatic shadows a dusting of light 
illuminating their inner and almost religious beauty 
it is a way of engaging the viewer beyond mere voyeurism the 
viewer becomes a part of the work 
the intense shadow composition of the triptych jim and tom 
sausalito 197778 is obliterated by the action in the picture 
in which one man urinates on another around the same time 
mapplethorpe did a selfportrait posed partly naked in leather 
with the handle of a bullwhip in his rectum 
they are among his most disturbing photographs from a period in 
which he unraveled a violent homosexual mystique for an 
unsuspecting audience they are terrifying sadomasochistic 
tableaux chained men leatherbound men men prepared for pain in 
an aristocratic setting 
but despite the frightening and sometimes sickening roughness of 
these sexual and psychological images mapplethorpe succeeded in 
crafting a rich tonal range 
he was involved in an incredibly wide variety of life the 
other side of which is death said the artist lowell nesbitt who 
first met and befriended mapplethorpe in 197172 
its very clear that much of his photographs were mirrors of 
his personal life i think that mapplethorpe really wanted to be 
censored he was pushing for it he was pushing the artistic 
barriers the way many artists have in the past to see how far he 
could push before he could met a boundary 
back in the early 70s a time of rainbow drugs and easy sex of 
troubled politics and an unpopular war mapplethorpe was into 
refashioning jewelry by adding materials to customize a piece for 
the owner 
mapplethorpe was one of six children born to joan and harry 
mapplethorpe he fled his catholic childhood in floral park 
queens for the bohemian earthiness of brooklyn in the 1960s 
there he received his art education at pratt institute 
it also was there that he encountered and forged a lasting 
friendship with radical poet and musician patti smith he spent his 
artistic lifetime photographing her in pictures ranging from early 
polaroids to the portrait he used on her 1988 lp dream of 
life 
he did portraits of actor richard gere artists louise nevelson 
and alice neel lawyer roy cohn body builder lisa lyon and 
transvestite candy darling and they were as varied as his 
classically poetic studies of flowers fruit and vegetables 
mapplethorpes eye consumed more than merely the flat surface of 
a photo he infused light and shadow certainly but he also 
applied textures and tones using fabric and paint such as platinum 
on linen or mesh wire overlays his early work utilized collage for 
drama and movement 
in his last years his work was austere a 1988 picture titled 
nipple could be a parched desert the moons surface or a dried 
river bed but it is a closeup of the human form

a tough electionyear crime bill that became 
a catchall for house members intent on sending a lawandorder 
message to voters is headed to a compromise committee with a veto 
threat attached 
the house passed the bill 36855 friday after first adopting a 
lengthy list of amendments 
most stiffened penalties and criminal law but the house also 
backed a provision barring execution of prisoners who can show that 
their death sentence was imposed because of racial discrimination 
the administration has strongly opposed that provision and 
attorney general dick thornburgh issued a statement reiterating 
that president bush will veto a bill that imposes racial quotas 
on our death penalty laws 
the bill goes back to the senate which has passed its own 
version and then to a conference committee to resolve differences 
among other amendments adopted by the house was one allowing the 
government to seize the homes of savings and loan executives 
convicted of fraud and who were using state homestead laws to keep 
their residences even when they are multimilliondollar mansions 
another established minimum penalties for sale of drugs within 
1000 feet of a truck stop or highway rest area 
the house voted 216204 to reject an amendment that would have 
removed a racial justice provision for the appeal of death penalty 
cases 
that provision would allow death row inmates to use racial 
statistics in their appeals to show the sentencing courts were 
biased and bars execution of prisoners who demonstrate their death 
sentence was imposed because of racial discrimination 
rep james sensenbrenner rwis offered the amendment to 
delete the provision with supporters saying it would dramatically 
weaken and perhaps abolish use of the death penalty 
backers said there was indisputable evidence that blacks are 
more likely to be sentenced to die than are whites 
rep jim slattery dkan cited what he said was an 
incredible fact never in the history of this country has a white 
man been convicted and executed for killing a black man or any 
minority 
as far as im concerned that makes the case there has been 
discrimination in the imposition of capital punishment slattery 
said 
congressional staffers said that assertion covered the more than 
125 executions carried out since capital punishment resumed in 
1977 the supreme court approved new state death penalty laws in 
1976 replacing those struck down by the court as unconstitutional 
in their application in 1972 
the house adopted another amendment lessening the burden of 
proof on the government to counter such evidence 
the senate excluded such a provision when it passed its version 
of the crime bill bush and congressional conservatives have been 
highly critical of the racial provision 
in his statement attorney general thornburgh clled on house 
and senate conferees to delete this misguided provision and send 
to the presidents desk a bill which does not nullify the death 
penalty 
unfortunately the house bill as passed would have the effect 
of nullifying many state death sentences now in effect and would 
threaten future enforcement of the death penalty at both the 
federal level and in the 37 states with capital punishment laws 
thornburgh said 
a dozen more crimes would be subject to the federal death 
penalty and executions would be carried out more quickly as a 
result of amendments added to the bill 
i hope we never bring up another crime bill a month before an 
election said rep william hughes dnj he complained during 
the debate that campaign considerations were overshadowing all 
else
