fifth avenue phyllis known as fifth avenue phil 
until the birth of her three babies is the only groundhog ever to 
move voluntarily into the central park zoo but now this very 
social animal is missing or worse 
the outgoing woodchuck who scampers up to people outside her 
hole under the childrens zoo and begs for italian ice hot dogs 
and pretzels has been gone almost two months some of her friends 
are sure she was killed by a car 
were still holding out hope zookeeper herb clement said 
monday shes been gone before shes not your everyday 
groundhog 
the plump brown beast first made the pages of the new york times 
in 1985 when she dug a hole near a driveway at the childrens zoo 
and set up housekeeping 
clement called it a case of reverse adoption and ignorant 
of the groundhogs sex dubbed her fifth avenue phil 
the groundhog may have been attracted by a crab apple tree that 
dropped its fruit on the driveway and by the grass and weeds in 
front of the zoo entrance but far better eating the beast soon 
realized was hers for the asking 
groundhogs can get used to people after awhile but she really 
stepped forward clement recalled shed walk out among the 
crowds and literally join them for lunch 
but it wasnt just the food this groundhog was truly 
gregarious 
she would walk right up to you rise up on her hind legs and 
rest her paws on your leg said virginia ferguson a neighborhood 
resident 
she was a new yorker first clement agreed and a 
groundhog second she wasnt even afraid of dogs 
a woman known to zoo regulars as the groundhog lady taught 
phyllis to come out of her burrow on cue and perform tricks she 
would sit on the womans lap and hold a banana as the woman peeled 
it she would beg on her hind legs for bits of cookie 
phyllis delighted her admirers with a litter of three pups then 
chilled them by the ruthlessness with which all groundhogs root 
their brood out of the hole 
phyllis again made the times in 1987 when clement wrote a 
letter to the editor citing the remarkable groundhog phyllis as 
an example of new york citys native wildlife 
the woodchuck he explained had gone far beyond her species 
traditional claim to fame the prediction of winters length and 
became the only groundhog to have voluntarily taken up residence 
in a zoo 
phyllis became a bigger attraction than most of the animals who 
joined the zoo involuntarily people come by to look for her and 
if she isnt around they want to know why clement said 
theyre quite insistent 
whenever there was a parade on fifth avenue phyllis would walk 
along the wall between the avenue and the park looking for 
leftovers 
but the groundhog disappeared at the end of july and on aug 16 
virginia fergusons husband donald was jogging in the park when 
he saw the body of a groundhog in the road it had been run over 
it was he believed phyllis 
mrs ferguson wrote this announcement and posted it near the 
gate 
to those watching for her 
she is gone 
she was killed by a car 
we all miss her 
mrs ferguson also spent 75 on a 5by7foot black and silver 
plaque that will be placed this week on a wall near the groundhogs 
old hole 
it reads in affectionate tribute to a remarkably friendly and 
tame groundhog the original fifth avenue phyllis

the word gentrification which comes from 
gentry or the british landowner class can mean investment and 
restoration in old neighborhoods but to those displaced by higher 
rents and changing styles it also can mean the end of home this 
third part of a continuing series city facescity fears looks 
at what gentrification has meant to one family

in another time returning home from 
work at the docks in fox point could take hours because everybody 
knew everybody in the waterfront neighborhood settled by 
descendants of old world seafarers 
on a summer afternoon there might have been time to sit on a 
neighbors porch for an iced tea or for a stop at manny almedias 
ringside tap for a sausage sandwich and a beer 
in those days relatives and friends followed early immigrants 
across the atlantic from portugal or the portuguesespeaking cape 
verde islands off west africa to live in coldwater tenements 
extended families lived together father and mother on one floor 
children and grandchildren on another 
ah those were the days for the britto brothers whose father 
came to the united states in 1915 to work as a stevedore 
john britto who was born in fox point 57 years ago and never 
moved more than a half mile doesnt use the word gentrification 
but thats what hes talking about when he says sadly you dont 
know your neighbors anymore 
in the 1970s and 80s the old fox point gave way to a new one 
neighboring brown university purchased property there and a 
combination of yuppies real estate speculators and historic 
preservationists bought many of the houses with government tax 
credits renovated them and sent the prices up by as much as 
tenfold 
not only could workingclass renters no longer afford their old 
neighborhood in some cases they could barely recognize it 
along wickenden street the main street manny almedias was 
turned into the cafe at brookes offering pepper provolone quiche 
and california burgers with avocado and cheddar 
my landlord had raised our rent the first time which wasnt 
bad explained john britto but in 1980 the block where he and 
his wife and six children lived was rezoned from residential to 
business and the landlord was back 
all of a sudden he wanted to put a lawyers office in his 
tenement and he raised it where i couldnt afford it maybe a 
couple of hundred more this is what theyre doing it happened to 
all of us 
by sheer persistence and with help from friends and politicians 
britto and his family managed to stay my roots are here he 
said taking over a threestory tenement house marked for 
demolition by the city redevelopment authority and fixing it up 
but two of his brothers sylvester 53 and vincent 64 had to 
move when their landlords raised the rents 
after living in a tripledecker house for 22 years with his wife 
and three children sylvester and two other families were asked to 
move five years ago the landlord told them he was redoing the 
house and would let them know when it wasfinished they never 
heard from him again 
in another neighborhood across town sylvester found a place for 
his family to live i was one of the lucky ones he said the 
people downstairs had to go live with a daughter 
even so he added i dont do nothing up here i go to fox 
point 
as for vincent britto even though he still misses his old 
neighborhood after 14 years he wouldnt move back today hed feel 
lost 
its not like it used to be he said all you had to do 
was come out of your house youll see someone you know its all 
strangers there now 
but the cape verdeans do come back once in a while gathering in 
the fox point boys club recapturing the memories and their youth 
on one such occasion vincent britto looked around at the 25 men 
sitting in the club one of the last vestiges of the ethnic 
neighborhood only two of the men still were living in fox point 
including his brother john 
we meet once a month john britto said they come to see 
each other to make sure everybodys ok we talk about old times 
sure everythings changed some people say it changed for the 
betterment of fox point but im saying the faces change the 
people change most of the people that lived here are gone theyve 
either moved or passed away 
as the men left john britto lingered casting a lonely figure 
across the empty auditorium floor 
a lot of these guys i wont see until next month he said 
before when we had the neighborhood it was a warm feeling we 
would gather like every day i miss the people i miss a lot of 
good friends 
no one knows for sure how many residents of fox point were 
displaced the 1980 census figures the latest available put the 
neighborhoods total population at 5499 but no breakdown by 
ethnic group is available 
in her book the immigration and the settlement of the 
portuguese in providence 18901924 susan terry ferst wrote that 
during that era fox point was about 50 percent portuguese and cape 
verdean 
theres still a substantial number of portuguese and cape 
verdeans in fox point but not nearly the large population as was 
10 to 15 years ago said thomas moses director of planning and 
development for the city of providence 
most moved to more affordable areas as their old neighborhood 
was renovated moses said 
the biggest negative is that it fractured them as a group 
he said 
some of the men at the boys club singled out brown university 
saying it had bought up property and that its students had taken 
over renting the renovated tenements living three and four to a 
house 
robert reichley vice president for university relations said 
that while browns wholly owned real estate subsidiary might buy 
houses and rent them their ultimate use is for educational 
purposes such as classrooms and research buildings 
the impact that brown had specifically was really in the 
decade of the 60s and maybe into the middle 70s he said but 
since that point the impact of gentrification on fox point is 
unmistakable and it is not the result of brown it is the result 
of people finding in many cases good real estate values which they 
have then improved upon 
along with higher property values have come upscale restaurants 
and shops but thats not what fox points old residents return 
for 
many times the cape verdeans and portuguese who have scattered 
into the suburbs of east providence and bristol meet when there is 
a death among them 
and after that wake says john britto its ill see you 
later at the next wake

while gentrification has spurred downtown renaissance it has 
unintentionally wiped out lowincome housing and contributed to 
homelessness 
the number of apartments renting for less than 250 a month 
declined nationally from 97 million in 1970 to 79 million in 
1985 according to a study released last year by the center on 
budget and policy priorities a washingtonbased nonprofit 
research organization 
the number of renters with incomes of less than 10000 annually 
grew from 73 million to 116 million in the same period the study 
said 
taken together that means that since 1970 there has been a 
serious shortage in affordable housing said paul leonard the 
reports principal author gentrification is one of a number of 
factors that contributed 
leonard said he is updating the report to include 1987 and that 
his initial assessment shows that the housing shortage for 
lowincome people is about the same 
woody widrow editor of shelterforce the magazine of the 
national housing institute in orange nj agreed 
these units either were demolished converted or rehabilitated 
and were lost as lowincome units he said when lowincome 
housing disappears lowincome renters are pushed into unaffordable 
housing some proportion becomes homeless 
the upside of gentrification is that neighborhoods get fixed up 
said phill clay an associate professor of city planning at 
massachusetts institute of technology but that often doesnt help 
the people who have lived there all along often minorities 
so they have to go somewhere else often they cant afford 
it clay said noting that cuts in government housing programs 
have compounded problems caused by gentrification 
ian d spatz an official of the national trust for historic 
preservation in washington called gentrification one of the more 
minor influences on urban neighborhoods 
far more important he said is disinvestment where poor 
people of all races are removed from their housing because of lack 
of maintenance and demolition for other purposes such as new 
construction highways skyscrapers and public works projects of 
one kind or another 
spatz acknowledged that in some neighborhoods such as 
georgetown in washington dc and society hill in philadelphia 
poor people have been pushed out by the wealthy but he said the 
numbers are small 
a much more important factor he said is that 
neighborhoods are simply being neglected by a combination of 
absenteeism ownership sometimes city policies and sometimes by 
residents themselves 
the national trust for historic preservation is doing a great 
deal to try to revitalize neighborhoods for existing residents 
spatz said 
he cited the springfield neighborhood in jacksonville fla 
which he described as poor with high unemployment and already 
substantial displacement from demolition 
the national trust has been involved in hundreds of projects 
across the nation where historic housing is being rehabilitated for 
continued lowincome use spatz said its easy to try to make 
wealthy people and historic preservationists out to be the bad 
guys the facts just dont support that

champions of a source of clean and abundant 
energy blew into town today arguing that america could live 
contentedly without any countrys oil if it only would harness the 
wind 
the american wind energy association brought together 300 
engineers consultants manufacturers scientists and visionaries 
to discuss the possibilities of using wind power to produce a 
substantial percentage of the nations electricity 
today the wind generates only a trifling fraction of the 
nations power 
more than 15000 wind turbines are in commercial use in 
california the worlds pioneer in windgenerated electricity 
they produce 22 billion kilowatts a year thats the equivalent 
of 35 million barrels of oil somewhat less than half of one days 
imports 
its also about 1 percent of the electricity the state consumes 
or an amount equal to the power used in all the homes of san 
francisco 
wind its advocates say is domestic and abounding the turbines 
it turns emit no carbon dioxide the villain in acid rain o other 
pollutants and dont contribute to the greenhouse effect the 
warming of the atmosphere 
according to randall swisher executive director of the 
association a new study establishes the immense potential of 
wind energy to meet americas energy needs 
the study said 15 percent of the area of the 48 contiguous 
states have usable winds averaging 16 mph or more at 50 meters 
above the ground similar to the winds that turn californias 
turbines 
such winds are being costeffectively developed today using 
current technology swisher said 
he said only four states alabama mississippi florida and 
louisiana lack commercial wind potential 
the study was conducted by pacific northwest laboratories 
operated by battelle memorial institute for the energy department 
the wind association capitalizing on concerns aroused by the 
persian gulf crisis sent its supporters to capitol hill to make 
the case for wind power 
mike marvin director of government affairs said the energy 
department as a response to the iraqkuwait situation had 
considered proposing a subsidy of 2 cents per kilowatt hour for 
windgenerated electricity but the advice was not taken by the 
white house 
marvin said advocates would argue that windgenerated 
electricity should be exempt from any energy tax congress enacts 
asked if there are any downsides to tapping the winds marvin 
said some people object to the eerie sight of miles and miles of 
slowly turning turbines and some object to the noise they make but 
technological advances have made the turbines hardly more noisy 
than the wind itself he said 
i happen to think its beautiful to see the rows and rows of 
wind turbines he said 
in addition to the areas with sustained winds averaging 16 mph 
or more pacific northwest laboratories found that 14 percent of 
the land area of the united states has winds averaging 14 mph or 
more 
swisher said the next generation of wind turbines will make 
development of those slower winds costeffective by the late 1990s 
when that happens he said america will be capable of producing 
more electricity than it uses by relying solely on the wind 
the report said california has developed only onefifth of its 
areas with 16 mph wind potential 
moreover it said californias wind potential is exceeded in 13 
states north dakota texas kansas montana south dakota 
nebraska wyoming oklahoma minnesota iowa colorado new mexico 
and idaho three states new york illinois and michigan have a 
potential equal to californias 
so far renewable energy sources geothermal solar and wind 
power account for only a tiny fraction of the nations energy 
supply onequarter of one quadrillion btus of energy in 1987 the 
country consumed 76 quadrillion in 1987

after months of bitter debate the board of 
supervisors recommended monday that the earthquakeruined 
embarcadero freeway be torn down and replaced by a groundlevel or 
underground road 
many longtime residents saw the earthquake damage as an 
opportunity to get rid of the elevated freeway which blocks views 
of san francisco bay and covers some prime real estate 
but merchants have demanded speedy repairs for the road which 
serves chinatown and the north beach restaurant district 
the resolution approved by the supervisors is strictly advisory 
because the state and federal transportation departments have final 
say on what to do about the 15mile stretch of freeway 
interstate 480 that has been shut since the oct 17 earthquake 
that damaged much of the city 
i congratulate the board an exultant mayor art agnos told a 
hastily called news conference he said he hoped there is enough 
state and federal money available to replace the embarcadero 
freeway with a surface or subsurface artery it connects chinatown 
and north beach with the bay bridge which leads to oakland 
chinatown merchants occasionally hooted at supervisors speeches 
that favored tearing down the freeway 
the mayor said he didnt want the elevated freeway to be knocked 
down until it is known there will be enough money to build a 
replacement partly on the surface and partly underground the 
resolution passed monday says virtually the same thing 
the cost for the road agnos favors is estimated at 135 million 
the mayor labeled the freeway a terrible blight on the face of 
our city for the last 35 years 
the boards 65 vote which came after 4 hours of speechmaking 
was characterized as a signal to the california department of 
transportation and the federal government that san francisco has 
finally made up its civic mind 
the board has been accused of repeatedly delaying the decision 
for political reasons

the manual on your fancy new home 
entertainment system says to access the next highest programmed 
station setting on the tv but warns the audio could be muted 
with improper handling 
if you didnt understand the instructions to change the channel 
and press the right button or risk losing sound welcome to the 
growing ranks of technodolts 
millions of americans have trouble doing things like setting vcr 
clocks or taping television programs they are thoroughly confused 
by many home electronics instruction books written in 
engineerspeak and cluttered with graphics says karen schriver an 
english professor at carnegie mellon university 
ms schriver was recruited by mitsubishi electronics america 
inc to rewrite its manuals so the average consumer can understand 
over the past two years she has made hundreds of revisions 
technical references and abbreviations were zapped and complicated 
drawings cleared up 
the beefier manuals were published on glossy paper with 
warning boxes lots of white space colored lines and detailed 
indexes the older manuals were flimsy crowded and dull 
the new manuals were packaged with this years mitsubishi 
television sets and stereo gear new books will accompany 1991s 
videocassette recorders video cameras and laserdisk players the 
company said 
mitsubishi is among a slowly growing number of japanese 
companies trying to improve communications with customers 
sansui usa inc for example claims its new vcr onscreen 
programming can be used by 5yearolds and will make you a 
technical wizard in no time 
but japanese companies are still in a period of learning 
whats expected of a manual in the united states said john hatch 
of the american electronics association in santa clara calif 
ms schriver says consumers ultimately are being cheated by all 
the technical language and drawings that look like spiders in 
many current electronics manuals 
were buying a vcr that costs more because it has neat 
features but in the end we use three buttons play record and 
rewind she said meanwhile the engineers are doing all these 
things with new functions but cant get their customers to do 
them 
at carnegie mellons communications design laboratory students 
interviewed 50 people trying to use mitsubishi products and noted 
their stumbling blocks with the old instructions 
there were several in this 65word mouthful on how to record 
from one vcr to another 
the mav1 and mav2 incorporates svhs inputs for svhs vcrs 
and an s monitor output for connection to an s compatible tv when 
two svhs vcrs are connected to the receiver with s cables it is 
not possible to dub from one to the other through the receiver 
when svhs to svhs dubbing using svideo cables is desired 
connect the vcrs directly to one another 
with the labs help it became you cannot record from one 
super vhs vcr to another through the receiver when you use svideo 
cables to do this you must connect the vcrs directly to each 
other 
the changes are making mitsubishi an industry leader in showing 
customers how to use products said ms schriver she said several 
japanese electronics companies inquired about applications of her 
research on their products 
ms schriver said the writers of manuals often have been 
entrylevel engineers who typically dwelled on the equipments new 
capabilities and forgot about the poor consumer who still wants 
to know about setting the clock standup comics across the 
country often target vcr owners whose machines forever are blinking 
1200 sunday because they cant set the day and time 
recent guests on the oprah winfrey show tried unsuccessfully 
for 30 minutes to program vcrs for taping 
charlene guyer a selfproclaimed technodolt and guest on 
the oprah show says shes confused by booklets for answering 
machines cameras vcrs and stereo components from several 
companies she says she has owned a panasonic vcr for four years 
but never taped a program 
part of my personality is impulsive if i cant do it quickly 
i dont want to do it said ms guyer a philadelphia marketing 
consultant you figure youre going to devote a lifetime just to 
turn the thing on so you become frustrated and end up calling in 
your neighbors kid and paying him 25 cents to do it 
even at carnegie mellon an institution known for computer 
science and engineering students regularly go to ms schrivers 
lab to plead for help hooking up electronic gear 
assisting such people is serious business said christopher 
freeble a mitsubishi communications design specialist and former 
student of ms schrivers 
we want to look at the product the same way the consumer looks 
at it freeble said from the companys headquarters in cypress 
calif a suburb of los angeles 
freeble said mitsubishi is losing money on the new expensive 
manuals because their costs arent passed on but the money is 
well spent 
we feel in the end well buy greater consumer loyalty he 
said

here are some of the changes made in mitsubishi electronics 
america incs manuals for television sets and videocassette 
recorders with the help of carnegie mellon university in 
pittsburgh 
before to access the next highest programmed station 
setting or to switch to a lower programmed station the scan 
buttons must be repeatedly pressed after to change channels 
press the scan buttons on the remote control 
before the audio output will be muted after you wont 
hear any sound 
before this vcr employs direct function switching where any 
playback mode may be directly entered from any other playback mode 
normal playback still frame speed search etc simply by 
pressing the appropriate buttons after when you use a feature 
like play or rewind you can go directly to another feature like 
speed search without first pressing stop 
before this vcr incorporates an elapsed time counter which 
shows tape run time in hours minutes and seconds since the 
counter works by detecting a control signal accurate time display 
will be maintained even through fast forward or rewind 
operations after the time counter shows how long the tape has 
run in hours minutes and seconds the time counter is accurate 
even when you rewind or fastforward the tape

one doctor stopped eating in his hospitals dining 
room when he finally tired of hearing other physicians brag about 
their fat incomes megabuck retirement funds and money money 
money 
another remembers a colleagues shock at learning her salary 
how could she be happy when her pay more than comfortable by most 
americans standards seemed so low 
money it seems is becoming an obsession for many in medicine 
doctors long have made lucrative livings but huge fees 
especially for surgery and hightech procedures have turned 
medical pay into a subject of intense fascination both for those 
who pull down skyhigh incomes and those who are jealous of the 
doctors who do 
greediness is becoming more and more an issue said dr 
michael v buenaflor of northampton penn guys are a lot more 
cynical and are turning to the american way of go for it 
but in the medical world at least money does not always buy 
happiness many doctors say they are fed up with their profession 
they complain of secondguessing insurance companies burdensome 
paperwork miserly medicare fees high malpractice rates and the 
constant fear of being sued among other things 
some argue that practicing medicine has become so unsatisfying 
that many are bent on making sure the work is financially 
rewarding even if its no longer fun 
and rewarding it is the latest statistics show that monetarily 
at least doctors are doing very well indeed their pay is going up 
far faster than almost everyone elses last year according to a 
survey their net income rose 125 percent almost triple the rate 
of inflation 
the survey conducted among 6484 doctors by the magazine 
medical economics found that the median net income of all us 
doctors rose almost 15000 in 1989 to 133000 
among other figures from the survey 
annual incomes ranged from 87000 for general practitioners 
to 296000 for cardiovascular surgeons 
one in five cardiovascular surgeons makes more than 600000 
annually 
the typical obstetricians pay soared 36000 last year more 
than any other specialty 
only 6 percent of doctors make less than 50000 a year 
many doctors contend they studied hard and put in long hours 
they deserve to make a good living they say 
when you consider that we work a 60some hour week that we 
put 12 years of training in and we owe 50 grand when we start on 
average i dont think anybody is robbing the bank said dr 
philip r alper an internist in burlingame calif 
we dont make an excessive wage he said i dont have an 
apology to make 
some in fact fear they are falling behind 
nobody feels bad for physicians we do make a good living 
said dr craig czarsty a family practitioner and doctors son in 
oakville conn but is my earning power the same as my fathers 
was 20 years ago probably not 
specialists are particularly well off but they contend they 
deserve to make more than other people including doctors in 
general care their work is often tedious and exacting they say 
and requires technical skills that take many years to perfect 
dr thomas purdon of the university of arizona health science 
center notes the special pressures faced by his colleagues in 
obstetrics and gynecology whose earnings the magazine survey pegs 
at 194000 
besides the many hours seeing women through their pregnancies 
labor and early motherhood there is a real possibility that each 
is a potential courtroom opponent 
the public expects an absolutely perfect product and doesnt 
want to recognize that there can be genetic problems and other 
things that the obstetrician has no control over said purdon 
if things dont turn out just aok the first thing they do is 
try to find a lawyer to sue him 
yet an undercurrent of feeling remains both inside and outside 
the profession that some doctors are just plain money hungry a 
survey conducted last year for the american medical association 
found that twothirds of americans think doctors are too interested 
in making money 
some of the criticism even comes from the wellpaid specialties 
dr peter s czachor of kittery maine notes that when he retired 
five years ago he was charging 700 for complete obstetrical care 
now doctors in his area are charging 2000 for the same thing and 
their malpractice rates are the same 
those complaining loudest about physician avarice often are 
doctors in the lowerpaying primary care specialties 
buenaflor is the doctor who grew weary of dining room talk of 
physicians financial conquests the final straw for him was an 
ear nose and throat specialist who said hed finished the year 
with an extra 160000 that he couldnt figure out how to spend 
buenaflor is a family practitioner traditionally the 
lowestpaid medical specialty last year according to the 
magazine survey they netted an average 97000 
often when these doctors on the front lines of medical care 
talk about money the conversation turns to specialists in more 
technical fields 
im going to be in my office 12 hours today buenaflor said 
i will net less than a colorectal guy across town will do for a 
20minute colonoscopy a routine diagnostic procedure 
dr lorilee smith a rheumatologist in modesto calif said she 
believes the financial attitudes of many young doctors who set up 
practice in the 1980s simply reflect the decades fixation on 
money she was struck by a conversation with a young dermatologist 
who moved into her building 
after she had been here for a while i told her what i made 
she was shocked she said but you seem so happy compared to 
dermatologists im making povertylevel wages even though i make 
great money smith said 
insurers have long paid high fees for technical procedures and 
operations and much less for the hours that primary care doctors 
spend figuring out which of these treatments their patients need 
but that will change at least a little 
beginning in 1992 medicare will reimburse doctors more for 
their time managing and evaluating patients and less for technical 
services and operations private insurance companies are expected 
to make similar changes 
this will raise the pay for family doctors and lower it for many 
surgeons and radiologists while the changes will narrow the 
spread it certainly will not eliminate it doctors who deliver 
babies will still make considerably more than say the 
pediatricians who care for them later is the pay of such 
specialists as obstetricians fair 
whats fair payment asks dr john graham an official of 
the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists 
he offers a sports analogy to bolster his pointis joe montana 
worth what he gets i dont know

yoyo dieting repeatedly losing and regaining weight may be 
more dangerous to the cardiovascular system than remaining somewhat 
overweight and may even promote weight gain researchers say 
longterm dieters also need to become educated about nutrition 
for example while the typical american diet includes about 40 
percent of its calories from fat many experts recommend 20 percent 
to 30 percent 
they really have very little idea what a portion size means in 
terms of cutting it xavier pisunyer director of the obesity 
research center at st lukesroosevelt hospital in new york said 
in a recent speech they have very little idea of how much fat is 
in a food they eat or how much sugar there is in a food they eat 
liederman knows his nutrition exercises daily and appears to 
have motivation in abundance but will he keep his weight off 
i could regress i could find some rationale i cant 
foresee liederman said i could still fall off the wagon 
frightening to a dieter 
by world war i when this country had its first bestselling 
diet book there also was a us food administration herbert 
hoover as its head called on the nation to eat less 
fatness was careless selfish wasteful treacherous and 
unamerican schwartz wrote there was to the culture of 
slimming between 1930 and 1960 an element of fear that the more one 
had the emptier one would be 
in 1952 the director of the national institutes of health 
declared obesity the primary national health problem in 1960 a 
fitness enthusiast called jack lalanne had the largest national 
daytime television show audience and before the decade was out a 
skinny model called twiggy became an idol 
obesity today is considered a major health problem associated 
with heart disease diabetes high blood pressure joint problems 
and other diseases much however remains unknown 
we dont yet understand how most heavy people get to be 
heavy brownell said 
genetics metabolism culture psychology and other things all 
play a role but their relative importance is not fully understood 
although some people are heavy simply because they eat too much and 
exercise too little many fat people however eat no more than 
thin people their bodies seem to use calories less efficiently 
maintaining weight loss seems harder than losing it estimates 
of the recidivism rate commonly top 90 percent though brownell 
suspects that is too high especially for hospitalbased 
comprehensive programs 
these are odds to attract only the foolhardiest bettor but in 
dieters hope springs eternal 
david liederman faces his obsession his way every day theres 
his theater district restaurant the broadway cafe his east side 
french restaurant chez louis and davids cookies little takeout 
shops where the huge chunks of chocolate ooze out of the dough 
when i was over 300 pounds i convinced myself i had to taste 
each batch of cookies this one might be different than that 
one liederman said 
until his doctor told him he might not live to see his daughters 
grow up 
neither of his young daughters is overweight but he is 
vigilant 
it scares me because i know what it did to me he said if 
i didnt have this problem id be a lot more productive

from the great cities to the small towns 
americas municipalities are telling the federal government they 
cant possibly be as small as census takers say 
by the thousands local officials are demanding something be 
done about the 1990 census even states are contesting the 
preliminary figures aware that the more residents they are 
credited with the more federal aid they will get and the greater 
their representation in congress will be 
some voices from the nationwide chorus 
unadulterated nonsense statistical grand larceny said 
new york mayor david n dinkins 
there are errors everywhere said detroit research director 
juliette okotieeboh 
it really stretches credibility to the breaking point said 
hartford conn mayor carrie saxon perry 
they missed our farthest south street said hays iowa 
city clerk judy grothe 
all were reacting to the preliminary results of the census 
bureaus april 15 head count 
the preliminary reports were sent out in late august and early 
this month to give officials a chance to file challenges in time 
for the bureau to doublecheck its numbers before announcing its 
final count dec 31 
census director barbara everitt bryant has already told congress 
there will be big changes in the initial numbers 
the census count will increase in practically every 
jurisdiction throughout the country because of ongoing coverage 
improvement programs she said 
even some states that posted gains in the preliminary figures 
are upset 
take texas despite recording significantly more people state 
officials say the count is not high enough 
our conservative estimate puts the states population at about 
17 million if the census final count stays with 168 million 
texas will definitely be shortchanged state comptroller bob 
bullock said 
but it is clearly from the jurisdictions that showed losses that 
the loudest complaints are coming 
such as west virginia credited with the largest population drop 
of any state 
many west virginians live up dirt roads and hollows and 
proving their existence has been as difficult as it has been for 
the census bureau to find them said bob brunner spokesman for 
gov gaston caperton 
or pennsylvania where vincent carocci spokesman for 
pennsylvania gov robert p casey said the preliminary count 
underestimated the population by 200000 to 300000 census takers 
undercounted the states cities carocci said because people there 
are just harder to count 
or tiny jacksonburg ohio which the census bureau said has 14 
residents last week 39 jacksonburg residents appeared at a 
protest of the count between them they said they could count at 
least 26 more people in the town 
denver mayor federico pena was stunned new york gov mario 
cuomo exclaimed i dont believe it atlanta mayor maynard 
jackson said if errors arent corrected well see them in 
court 
barraged with such complaints the census bureau is having 
workers do rechecks of some neighborhoods add late reports and 
factor in military personnel overseas 
the bureau has its hands full 
in iowa officials say as many as 75000 residents were missed 
in louisiana said a representative of avoyelles parish we 
know for sure thats not right several types of errors were made 
but i dont know what kind something went wrong but i guarantee 
that we will get to the bottom of this 
why are the numbers so important 
simple after the nations population is counted every 10 years 
the house of representatives is reapportioned and federal and state 
aid formulas are adjusted losing people or not growing as fast as 
other places can mean a loss of political power and federal aid 
until the next census 
the census news wasnt bad everywhere though 
seattle and washington state officials are pleased with the 
preliminary counts which exceeded their own estimates 
we still think there are people out there that the census did 
not count but generally we think they did a pretty good job 
said urban research analyst eric friedli 
my impression is that we have a smaller proportion of people 
who arent going to respond or who arent going to be counted i 
dont see any outstanding reason to say this is a bad census 
said lawrence weisser a state research investigator 
officials in sacramento calif are puzzled by preliminary 
census figures 5 percent higher than they had estimated im at a 
loss said scott mende a city planner

ali hussain goes to school by 
candlelight he works all day punching holes in tin for toy 
harmonicas and daylight has faded before he gets to his books 
electricity is in short supply 
so are schools until six years ago tikea para one of the 
poorest areas in a city notorious for its slums had no elementary 
school 
the predominantly moslem residents took matters into their own 
hands chipping in manpower and a few rupees today 400 children 
go to a oneroom school built run and taught by people from the 
neighborhood 
another 80 child laborers go to night class not always winning 
the struggle to stay awake ali 8 says he earns 184 a week 
this is a very backward area these are poor people and there 
are too many child workers said sekander khan secretary of the 
residents committee 
we cant stop child labor khan said if we cant give 
them an education they will be like this all their lives 
the residents of tikea para have gone farther than most to 
collectively help themselves in a city incapable of coping with its 
population explosion 
in the last 50 years waves of migrants from bangladesh and from 
indian villages have swollen calcuttas population to 12 million 
an estimated 43 percent live in slums or bustees uncounted 
thousands camp on the street 
tikea para is a bustee of about 100000 people in howrah a 
municipality across the hooghly river fro calcuttas business 
district 
the slum dwellers were galvanized into community action when a 
woman in the neighborhood was raped by a gang of hoodlums running 
an illegal liquor store khan said with police help they cleaned 
out the area fenced off their bustee and took a hard look at their 
childrens future 
the school began in 1984 with 20 children sitting on the dirt in 
the neighborhood courtyard they applied for municipal help but 
were told other education projects had higher priority khan said 
now kids in tidy uniforms attend classes taught by young 
unemployed university graduates from the neighborhood they sit on 
wooden benches jostling papers on their laps because they have no 
desks 
the school operates two daytime shifts with two grades sitting 
in the same room each shift a row of sewing machines occupies the 
back 
the courtyard has been taken over by a homemade merrygoround 
with wooden horses 
twice weekly a volunteer doctor from a nearby germansponsored 
clinic visits the bustee receiving patients in a tiny back room of 
the school 
tikea para has about 70 small factories worked mostly by 
children as young as 5 the most recent estimates say india had 
166 million child laborers in 1986 
the bustees of calcutta and howrah mark the decline of a 
oncegreat city some call it the lowest form of urban life 
until 1912 calcutta was the capital of india the second 
city of the british empire after london its gracious gothic 
buildings green lawns wide boulevards and exclusive clubs 
provided the backdrop for a lifestyle that symbolized the peak of 
the colonial age 
the victorianstyle buildings are eroding under an assault of 
grime and neglect shantytowns have sprung up in the open spaces of 
welltodo areas 
howrah is a warren of celllike shacks separated by open sewers 
but inside the shacks the stone floors are spotlessly clean 
residents bathe openly partially dressed under water pumps 
which kids usually turn into a game 
hunger is rife ragdraped people can be seen picking through 
mounds of garbage for scraps of food competing with mangy dogs 
crows and cattle 
it was here that mother teresa a frail roman catholic nun 
became known as the saint of the gutters for giving dying 
homeless people a bed succor and dignity in their last hours 
but the 800000 people of howrah show a surprising resilience 
and acceptance in the face of crushing poverty and hunger 
people are not unhappy here especially the children said 
helgo meyerhamme a west german doctor on a sixweek volunteer 
stint in the clinic 
in germany people are rich live in nice houses and have 
plenty to eat but they are not happy here the children laugh all 
the time they can play with anything even a little piece of paper 
can be a toy we can learn from these people said meyerhamme 
the doctors say most of their patients suffer from hunger and 
hygienerelated diseases worms tuberculosis skin diseases and 
respiratory illness leprosy is common 
these people have nothing to look forward to concluded 
meyerhammes colleague bettina borgmann but the people 
surprised me most seem quite happy

democrat john silbers unexpected victory in the 
massachusetts gubernatorial primary is renewing questions about 
whether voters lie to pollsters 
the same questions followed the careers of barry goldwater and 
george wallace whose support was understated in some polls 
silber on leave as president of boston university defeated 
former attorney general francis x bellotti by a comfortable 
9point margin winning 53 percent of the vote in tuesdays 
democratic primary 
polls published just before the election showed bellotti ahead 
and surging one poll gave bellotti a lead of 50 percent to 39 
percent an electioneve survey showed bellotti leading 49 percent 
to 35 percent 
gerry chervinsky whose polls at krc communications research in 
cambridge showed bellotti in the lead close to the primary 
believes some poll respondents hid their support for silber 
they liked silbers combative style and confrontational 
rhetoric but werent willing to admit it he believes 
i dont think theres any question at all that voters were not 
forthcoming about voting for silber chervinsky said it was 
socially unacceptable to say it was impolite to say im voting 
for silber 
other factors also contributed to the polling problem such as 
the difficulties of predicting turnout in a primary and of 
determining whether independent voters will take a democratic or 
republican ballot chervinsky said 
but silber in a television interview sunday said his and 
election results elsewhere in the nation reflected a growing 
antimedia sentiment 
on abctvs this week with david brinkley program he said he 
believed one of the polls was slanted in the sample that it 
took 
silber had warned weeks before the primary that some pollsters 
would be looking for work after sept 18 because they were 
missing his supporters he speculated that his backers viewed 
questions from pollsters as an invasion of privacy 
the polls were off only in the democratic gubernatorial primary 
other massachusetts races some of them close and volatile were 
predicted accurately 
exit polls indicated as many as 20 percent of the voters made up 
their minds in the last days of the campaign and went 
overwhelmingly for silber but chervinsky said voters who concealed 
their support for silber could have skewed polls by as much as 10 
points 
experts differ on whether voters willfully mislead pollsters 
if i believed that people lied in the telephone interview 
process id have to get out of the polling business and get a 
broom said john becker of the sudburybased becker isstitute 
inc which conducted some early polls its all speculation no 
one ever produces any evidence that people lie 
university of virginia political scientist larry sabato says 
lying is more of a pollsters excuse than a reality 
any voter fibbing that does take place probably is canceled out 
by fibbing in the opposite direction he said 
but the gallup organization a nationwide polling firm in 
princeton nj has developed evidence from past elections that 
voters may mislead pollsters about particular candidates or 
situations 
paul perry who was president of gallup from 1959 to 1976 said 
studies conducted during sen barry goldwaters campaign for 
president in 1964 showed some voters were reluctant to admit they 
supported goldwater 
polling conducted by secret ballot showed greater support for 
goldwater than that revealed by traditional facetoface or 
telephone polling 
even more marked disparities turned up when george wallace ran a 
thirdparty campaign for president in 1968 studies showed that a 
larger number of voters supported the segregationist alabamian than 
were willing to admit to pollsters 
silber while no clone of goldwater or wallace is similar in 
his flinty brusque straighttalking style he says things that 
some people find offensive and that may have led voters to conceal 
their support for him 
there may be some people with hidden preferences said 
perry as to whether it amounts to lying i guess youd have to 
say thats what theyre doing 
in any event the difference between what voters may tell 
pollsters and how they actually vote is never more than 10 percent 
perry said 
sabato said the lesson of the massachusetts democratic primary 
is simple lets pay a great deal less attention to polling 
you cannot precisely predict what human beings are going to do

a black county commissioners threat that a 
violent street war would erupt if the city hires a good old boy 
police chief exposed festering racial tensions that some say 
threaten to tear this city apart 
the problem in dallas is not the minority community and the 
dallas police department said pettis norman a former dallas 
cowboys football star who is now a successful local businessman 
the problem is the institutionalized racism we have in dallas 
as the talk turned last week to who would replace the ousted 
mack vines as police chief minority activist and county 
commissioner john wiley price issued a call to arms he warned that 
vines a white whose policies were praised by minority leaders had 
better not be replaced by a good old boy a traditional 
southern white 
if that happened price said a violent street war would follow 
in which he and others would shoot at police and take this whole 
city 
although shocking prices words were only the latest of several 
indicators that all is far from well in this city of nearly 1 
million residents of which about a third are black 
the southern suburbs are threatening to secede amid reports 
that more tax money is spent in affluent mostly white north 
dallas 
in december residents go to the polls to vote on a referendum 
that would eliminate atlarge city council districts which a judge 
ruled dilute minority voting strength 
last month a dallas times herald survey of 1988 sentencing 
revealed killers and rapists whose victims were white received 
harsher punishment than those whose victims were black or hispanic 
a dallas morning news survey in 1988 reported that 44 percent 
of the citys black population and 44 percent of its white 
population agree race relations have deteriorated within the past 
five years 
change must take place now that lessens racial polarization 
and bridges the gaps between our people a task force called 
dallas together concluded last year the force was formed after a 
record number of police shootings of citizens most of them black 
or hispanic in 1988 
norman said the racism extends beyond the police department and 
includes churches that dont denouce racism and a business 
community that makes it hard for black business people to get 
loans 
but the police department has been a focal point of minority 
concerns vines who is white was hired as chief two years ago to 
help address the situation 
he won praise from price and other minority leaders for an 
aggressive affirmative action policy and sensitivity to minorities 
but rankled some members of his department 
he was fired sept 12 hours after his indictment on a 
misdemeanor perjury charge 
vines pleaded innocent to the charge of lying to a special panel 
investigating the firing of police officer patrick lemaire he 
fired lemaire in june 1989 after the officer shot and killed an 
unarmed mexican 
lemaire who said he thought the man was reaching for a weapon 
was reinstated by a review board but decided not to return to the 
force 
six days after vines firing price gave the city his good old 
boy ultimatum 
people on both sides of the issue blasted the remarks and price 
backed off somewhat i probably shouldnt have said it he said 
later 
its so obvious what my comment would be im not going to 
comment said mayor annette strauss 
violence is wrong too said peter johnson regional director 
of the southern christian leadership conferences southwestern 
office based in dallas we have to move beyond that 
norman said he told price his remarks were ludicrous 
but he added that the frustrations of racism remain 
every couple of years we incorrectly redefine the problem and 
try to correct it he said

alwihdat jordan ap in this dusty palestinian refugee camp 
a softspoken victim of the invasion of kuwait calculated the hefty 
losses in his young life with a shrug and prayer for peace 
isam alabsi is 24 homeless stateless and quite suddenly 
poor 
in the fallout of the aug 2 invasion he is among the faceless 
numbers forced to survive on their wits without recourse to 
government aid 
while world attention has focused on the military standoff in 
the persian gulf and the plight of asian refugees in desert camps 
tens of thousands of jordanians and palestinians have returned from 
kuwait to find jobs scarce and hope waning 
in kuwait we were stable said alabsi we were set up in 
our jobs we had good careers cars homes everything was complete 
for us and now we dont have a home we dont have careers we 
dont have cars 
the young civil engineer whose family fled palestine to jordan 
in 1948 said he left kuwait on tuesday reached jordan the next 
day and hopes eventually to join his family in cairo egypt they 
were vacationing there when iraq attacked kuwait 
authorities in amman estimate that half the 120000 jordanians 
working in kuwait and an unknown number of palestinians are 
returning to jordan which is itself facing economic catastrophe 
from the persian gulf crisis 
finance minister basel jardaneh said jordan is considering what 
it can do to help but for now it has no aid program 
government officials are worried about how to absorb such huge 
numbers in a country where unemployment is already officially 
estimated at 15 percent and where the economy is teetering on the 
brink of collapse 
nobody can find a job here mohammed sabti said glumly as 
stood before his familys cementblock house on a rocky hillside in 
the small town of awagan 
the 22yearold jordanian said he lost his job selling used cars 
in kuwait because all the cars were stolen from the dealership 
after the invasion 
sabti who holds a university degree in hotel management said 
he has failed to find a job in jordan and plans to return to 
occupied kuwait in two weeks to look for work 
if i could find a job here that would pay a salary of even 100 
jordanian dinars about 160 a month id stay he said 
prince sadruddin aga khan the un secretarygenerals special 
envoy for humanitarian assistance in the gulf crisis said last 
week that the palestinian and jordanian workers along with 
thousands of asian refugees have to be considered victims of the 
crisis 
for all these people its a broken dream all of them tell 
the same story they became destitute overnight he said 
alabsi said he and other foreign workers in kuwait blame iraqi 
president saddam hussein for their losses he said they dont 
support saddams demand that an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait be 
tied to a solution of the palestinian problem 
here in jordan and the other arab places they dont see the 
problem as we see it he said 
those who lived in kuwait for 10 years or even three or four 
years are against the invasion because of the suffering it has 
caused he added 
we want to get palestine back but i dont think this is the 
way to do it the way to palestine is not through kuwait 
he said the palestinian support inside kuwait for the iraqi 
occupation came from those who arrived after the invasion and who 
are gaining benefits from the invasion 
ousted kuwaiti officials say saddam is trying to expel kuwaitis 
they say he is attempting to repopulate kuwait with iraqis and 
iraqs supporters 
i dont think anyone who stands on the side of truth is in 
favor of the invasion but were also against any harm to iraq we 
want this to end peacefully alabsi said

israel has won friends and outmaneuvered some 
enemies during the persian gulf crisis but many fear the country 
may face longterm political losses in a rapidly changing middle 
east 
senior officials in the rightwing government of prime minister 
yitzhak shamir said that despite iraqi threats to attack israel 
the country appears better off today than it did two months ago 
today the advantages outweigh the disadvantages but we dont 
know what will be in the future said yossi olmert head of the 
government press office 
among the shortterm benefits to israel 
the americans busy in the gulf have eased pressure on israel 
to settle its conflict with the palestinians 
israels two worst enemies iraq and the palestine liberation 
organization have discredited themselves in the eyes of the west 
in view of iraqi threats the americans are expected to be 
responsive to israeli demands for more military aid 
the crisis has accelerated rapprochement between israel and the 
soviet union soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev met israeli 
cabinet ministers this month for the first time 
at the same time israel is concerned about huge us arms sales 
to prowestern arab states israel fears these weapons will tip the 
strategic balance in the middle east in favor of the arabs 
they arab countries never use these weapons for their 
defense and if they ever use them we are afraid they will be used 
against us shamir warned after the americans proposed selling up 
to 21 billion worth of weapons to saudi arabia 
some israeli analysts say the arms deals are a sign that a new 
doctrine is taking hold in washington under which saudi arabia may 
outweigh israel as a us ally in the middle east 
one of the main dangers for israel is a deterioration in its 
status in the eyes of the united states wrote yaakov goldberg a 
researcher at tel aviv universitys dayan institute for middle east 
research 
israels rivals are already busy drafting a new sketch whereby 
israel would no longer be an american strategic asset because the 
soviet threat has disappeared and because israel has no part in 
interarab disputes he wrote in the daily haaretz 
olmert the government press official played down such 
concerns its inevitable that the saudis will be no 1 on the 
list of american priorities for a while but that hasnt changed 
the nature of usisraeli relations 
other analysts say that once the gulf crisis is settled there 
may be momentum to resolve the israelipalestinian conflict 
with the americans and the soviets on the same side of the 
fence it might be difficult for israel to withstand the pressure 
to make a deal including giving up the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
already the americans reportedly have warned israel to show 
some flexibility on us compromise peace proposals once the gulf 
conflict is resolved 
gerald steinberg a middle east historian at tel avivs bar ilan 
university said he expected more pressure on israel to make 
concessions once the gulf crisis is resolved 
international support for a palestinian state however is 
dwindling steinberg said its likely that a palestinian state 
would become a miniiraq and therefore no western country would 
support such a state he said 
israels most imminent concern is that americans would settle 
for an iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and leave the gulf without 
having destroyed saddam husseins war machine 
the israelis argue that in such a case israel would be left 
alone to deal with a stronger and more dangerous iraq 
israel has tried to get that message across while trying not to 
look like a warmonger 
olmert spelled out israels double message we dont incite 
the americans to do this or that but aggressive elements in the 
middle east should be punished enough so they are not able to 
repeat their aggression 
some analysts are quick to point out that the israelis are not 
the only ones pushing for a us attack against iraq 
the egyptians and the saudis are pressing even harder than 
israel for military action said mark heller an analyst at tel 
aviv universitys jaffee center for strategic studies 
amid the various scenarios on how the gulf crisis will end only 
one thing seems certain it will dramatically transform the middle 
east 
syria once israels most implacable foe is edging toward the 
west and there is speculation it might talk peace with israel 
jordan once considered israels silent partner is moving deeper 
into the iraqi sphere 
we will have a new order in the middle east steinberg said

a japanese cabinet ministers offhand suggestion 
that american blacks ruin white neighborhoods reflects the deep 
prejudices and provincialism that still hinder japans muchtouted 
internationalism analysts say 
justice minister seiroku kajiyamas public comments friday in 
which he compared blacks to prostitutes were the latest to 
aggravate relations between japanese politicians and us 
minorities blacks also have heard themselves belittled in recent 
years as illiterate and financially irresponsible 
each incident has drawn howls of us protest yet such comments 
keep cropping up because japan for all its export savvy and love 
of western goods remains in many ways as isolated from western 
thinking as it has for most of its long history observers say 
japan is a society of fundamental discrimination against other 
ethnic and racial groups said patricia steinhoff former head of 
the university of hawaiis center for japanese studies 
japanese politicians used to be able to get away with this 
kind of thing but now all of a sudden they cant because of 
adverse publicity she said i dont really think they know where 
to draw the line 
at a news conference following a police roundup of foreign 
prostitutes in tokyo kajiyama coomented friday that such 
prostitutes ruin the atmosphere of neighborhoods when they 
arrive 
its like in america when neighborhoods become mixed because 
blacks move in and whites are forced out said the newly 
appointed minister who previously held two other key cabinet 
posts including head of the ministry of international trade and 
industry 
shortly afterward the justice ministry issued a statement from 
kajiyama who said he meant to convey that people living in that 
district of tokyo feel insecure 
it said the 64yearold ministers comments contained 
expressions that may cause misunderstanding but it did not 
offer an explicit apology 
ralph neas executive director of the leadership conference on 
civil rights in washington called kajiyamas comments 
reprehensible and racist 
japanese analysts say racism here often reflects the nations 
pride in its own supposed racial purity in 1985 for example the 
ministry of foreign affairs issued a report attributing japans 
economic successes to its racial homogeneity 
japanese are continuously being reminded of the uniqueness of 
their culture by their teachers newspapers and tv programs 
dutch author karel van wolferen wrote in a muchdiscussed recent 
book the enigma of japanese power 
even japanese who have been partially educated abroad are 
actively discriminated against and are often the object of teasing 
and class bullying when they return van wolferen said they 
are invariably made to feel they are contaminated 
black athletes and entertainers are popular on japanese 
television along with others who seem to satisfy an everlasting 
hunger here for things western and officially the government 
continues its policy of internationalization urging companies 
to hire more foreigners 
but in japanese eyes foreigners always remain gaijin 
outside people 
some japanese point out that us politicians also occasionally 
commit racial gaffes and insult foreign cultures indeed japan is 
a favorite target these days relentlessly criticized in washington 
both over trade and its level of support for the us stand in the 
persian gulf 
do you think that us politicians are so sensitive to world 
opinion japanese government members can be seen at about the 
same level as us congressmen said seizaburo sato a tokyo 
university politics professor who served as adviser to former prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone 
the outspoken nakasone caused a stir himself in 1986 when he 
said on the average the united states is lower because of a 
considerable number of blacks puerto ricans and mexicans 
the prime minister said he was referring to literacy rate he 
later apologized and said he realized his comment had offended 
many americans but he did not retract his remarks 
japanese politicians have landed in hot water for other comments 
denigrating women other asians and people of other countries 
more and more however theyre being forced to curb their 
tongues if only because japan sends about 40 percent of its 
exports to the united states and many of its consumers are 
minorities 
ms steinhoff who is now doing research in tokyo said that in 
the past the press often part of the same oldboy network as 
the politicians simply didnt report such comments 
the japanese will still say these things about koreans and any 
other group they can find when they see them as politically 
powerless she said but they dont realize this is out of 
bounds in the media politics of the west

the people of english fed up with floods 
are packing up main street and moving to higher ground 
in one of the most ambitious projects of its kind the town 
plans to tear down or move more than 70 homes as well as the 
library the bank the newspaper and about 30 other businesses 
a new downtown is planned a mile away on a hillside now covered 
by cornfields and trees 
the town of 650 people in one of the states poorest counties 
hopes to raise 6 million for the move from a halfdozen state and 
federal agencies 
the towns made the decision to move and were going to move 
we dont blink an eye to anyone when we say that said tony 
pappano a community developer hired to plan the move 
abuut 75 percent of the town will be affected by the move 
pappano said 
five inches of heavy rain to the north can wreak havoc in 
english where three creeks merge to form the little blue river 
each of the creeks normally is quiet and shallow enough for 
children to go wading without getting their knees wet but the 
streams can rise 20 feet in hours when thousands of acres to the 
north begin draining toward english 
floods have struck occasionally during the towns 150year 
history the worst on record sent 13 feet of water down main street 
in 1979 
it was a flash flood that struck early on the morning of june 7 
forcing evacuation of more than 100 residents that convinced town 
council president john merrilees 
were going he said theres too much lives and property 
at stake not to 
other floodprone towns have moved but english is planning one 
of the largest such projects in the country said bill powers of 
the federal emergency management agencys chicago office 
the threemember town council voted last week to condemn 
property in the flood plain that covers the heart of town 
residents who live there will be forced to sell their homes to the 
county 
the next step is annexation and zoning of about 600 acres to the 
northeast doubling the towns size the area should be annexed 
within two months pappano said 
a fema architect and a 44000 planning grant from the agency 
helped english come up with plans for a new downtown it would be 
connected to the buildings left behind by a new road 
we want to keep the entire town together we dont want an old 
town and a new town it will all be one english pappano said 
the town would like to make the flood plain area into a park 
possibly with a golf course and tennis courts pappano said 
all that depends on how much money can be obtained from the 
state fema the department of housing and urban development the 
commerce department and anyone else willing to help 
some elderly residents are apprehensive about the move 
temple real 82 said he has lived on camp fork creek all his 
life and sees no reason to leave now three feet of water flooded 
his house in 1979 but since then the floods havent topped the 
porch 
when youve lived some place all your life you respect it 
real said someone else maybe doesnt and wants to move away 
thats all right but they should leave me alone 
there has been little opposition to the move because the town 
has been dying for years pappano said empty storefronts pepper 
the two blocks of businesses along main street and several homes 
are for sale along fifth street the towns other main road 
crawford county is historically the most economically 
depressed county in indiana and the world is moving without them 
pappano said 
would you want to drop 5 cents in a business in downtown 
english he asked after the last flood the businesses 
themselves said were not staying for another one

a court decision allowing audio tapes of 
counseling to be used in a murder trial has mental health 
professionals worried that the ancient tradition of patient 
confidentiality is in danger 
california courts opened the door to the psychotherapists 
office a bit wider with a decision aug 6 allowing tapes of 
counseling to be used against brothers lyle and erik menendez in 
the slaying of their parents 
jose and kitty menendez were shot repeatedly at close range in 
their beverly hills mansion in 1989 six months later police 
arrested lyle 21 and erik 19 alleging the young men coveted 
their parents 15 million estate 
prosecutors argued that tapes of the brothers counseling 
sessions with therapist l jerome oziel in which they reportedly 
confessed to killing their parents could be used as evidence 
superior court judge james albracht agreed saying the tapes 
were not covered by laws guarding patinttherapist communication 
these statutes are an extension of the right of privacy between 
doctor and patient that dates to greek philosopher hippocrates the 
founder of modern medicine the hippocratic oath still taken by 
new physicians binds doctors to secrecy about their patients 
cases 
many psychotherapists say the courts are eroding this vow when 
the need to protect society clashes with an individuals right to 
privacy 
confidentiality is the cornerstone of the relationship between 
patient and therapist said win schachter an attorney for the 
american psychological association in sacramento they patients 
talk about their most intimate and deepest thoughts if there is a 
hole in that privacy they will feel less secure and safe 
albrachts menendez decision was upheld by the state court of 
appeal and is now before the california supreme court which 
ordered the tapes sealed until it decides whether to hear the case 
in making his decision albracht cited a recent state supreme 
court case people vs clark 
william john clark was convicted of injuring his former 
therapist and murdering her husband by setting the couples home on 
fire while in therapy during the trial clark told another 
psychologist he wanted to kill two other people 
that therapist warned the two people following guidelines 
established in a 1974 landmark dutytowarn ruling called the 
tarasoff decision she later testified about clarks murderous 
desires 
clark sentenced to death appealed the verdict arguing that he 
had not given his therapist permission to break confidentiality 
but the supreme court ruled the sessions were not privileged 
because the therapist had already broken confidentiality by issuing 
the warnings as required under tarasoff 
since the oziel tapes as well as transcripts of the secret 
hearings on their admissibility remain sealed it is not known 
for sure what parallels exist between the clark and menendez cases 
yet a woman who claims to have had a romantic relationship with 
oziel said in the current issue of vanity fair magazine that the 
therapist let her listen to sessions in which the brothers 
confessed to the murders 
although oziel has denied he shared the tapes refusing further 
comment prosecutors say the brothers threatened the therapist 
under tarasoff this would make the counselors alleged sharing of 
the tapes acceptable and therefore admissable in the menendez case 
under clark 
once the facts become known albracht said it will be 
fairly clear that this case falls squarely within the statute 
gerald chaleff lyle menendezs attorney acknowledged that 
threats were made but questioned the judges decision to allow all 
the tapes into evidence what has to be divulged is only what is 
necessary to prevent danger he said 
the apas schachter said the menendez decision could have a 
chilling effect on therapy 
the decision might imply that any careless words or placing of 
files might inadvertently trigger an opening of what was believed 
to have been confidential he said it could be incredibly 
damaging 
however elliott alhadeff the prosecutor who argued for the 
tapes to be released said the patient has nothing to worry 
about as long as he trusts his psychotherapist 
in the 1950s and 1960s nearly all states passed laws requiring 
physicians and therapists to report suspected child abuse 
next came the farreaching tarasoff decision by the california 
supreme court it requires counselors to warn people who they feel 
may be in danger from their patients based on conclusions stemming 
from the patients treatment the decision makes thetherapist 
liable for civil damages for any harm that may occur 
dozens of other court decisions have further limited patient 
privacy and therapists wonder where it will end 
will we have the same duty to prevent burglary or if someone 
says he is going to punch that kid asked gary schoener a 
minneapolis psychologist who has published many articles on 
confidentiality where do you draw the line you cant expect the 
therapist to do the job of policing society

normally oceans apart the us 
navys two hospital ships have been brought together for the first 
time by the american military buildup in saudi arabia 
the uss comfort based at baltimore and uss mercy whose home 
port is oakland calif are assigned to the atlantic and pacific 
theaters respectively 
this month they arrived in the persian gulf preparing to handle 
a major influx of battle casualties up to 2000 at a time if 
war breaks out 
it would be the first combat test for the two converted 
container ships painted white with large red crosses in compliance 
with the geneva convention 
we are planning for a massive number of casualties if 
there were hostilities there would be great numbers in the first 
few days capt paul d barry who commands medical operations 
aboard mercy told journalists who visited the ship anchored off 
bahrain on sunday 
the comfort was visible on the horizon several miles away 
as with a military field hospital the stess is on triage the 
grim process of evaluating battle injuries to determine which are 
most serious yet survivable 
the focus of the trauma medium is on those first few golden 
hours said lt cmdr martin robinson who runs the mercys 
casualty receiving area the faster you get an individual to a 
medical treatment facility the better their chances are 
at 69000 tons each the mercy and comfort are bigger than 
bttleships and exceeded in size among navy vessels only by 
aircraft carriers which run 75000 tons and up 
each has 1000 beds 500 for major cases the rest for the less 
seriously wounded only 11 us hospitals are larger 
on sunday only five patients were being treated aboard mercy 
none of them combat casualties 
among the nearly 1000 people aboard each ship are 570 medical 
personnel including 40 doctors and dentists and 125 nurses about 
30 percent of mercys complement are female and 70 of the 
crewmembers are civilians 
the medical facilities aboard mercy and comfort are far advanced 
from 25 years ago when two earlier navy hospital ships sanctuary 
and repose cruised off vietnam 
those two ships were credited with saving the lives of hundreds 
of wounded gis 
dr robert cave 53 of oakland a plastic surgeon who served 
aboard the sanctuary in vietnam said the mercy has tremendously 
more capacity such as 12 operating rooms to the older ships

the japanese admiral who planned the pearl 
harbor attack got the idea from a british novel says a new book 
examining us and japanese strategy in world war ii 
admiral isoroku yamamoto who insisted on the 1941 surprise 
raid that destroyed much of the us pacific fleet at its base in 
hawaii based his strategy on a book that had washington buzzing 
when yamamoto was japanese naval attache here from 1926 to 1928 
says author william h honan 
the 1925 novel the great pacific war by hector c bywater 
begins with a surprise japanese attack in 1931 that wipes out much 
of the us asiatic fleet 
honans book bywater the man who invented the pacific war 
went on sale earlier this month in england it is due for us 
publication in february with the title the man who knew too much 
how hector c bywater invented the great pacific war 
bywater was a british secret agent in germany who later became a 
leading expert on the worlds navies in the prejet age when 
national strength was measured in battleship tonnage 
from 1920 to 1940 he wrote for newspapers and magazines on both 
sides of the atlantic covered major naval disarmament conferences 
in london and washington and published several books 
it was more than coincidence that the course of the war was 
predicted in bywaters novel says author honan currently the new 
york times chief cultural correspondent 
honan presents exhaustive research intended to show that 
bywaters writings profoundly influenced japanese strategists led 
by yamamoto supreme commander of the imperial navy combined fleet 
and architect of the pearl harbor attack 
the great pacific war was translated into japanese and for a 
time was required reading for japanese navy officers it also 
inspired japanese imitations that switched endings and had the 
japanese winning the war 
yamamoto spent a year at harvard university in 1919 and returned 
to america seven years later with the rank of navy captain for his 
washington stint 
back in japan yamamoto in a lecture adopted bywaters ideas 
as his own honan says the author adds that the japanese naval 
officer in 1941 threatened to resign with his entire staff to force 
acceptance of his plan to eradicate the american naval presence 
in midpacific at the start of the war 
this was precisely bywaters conception honan says and 
yamamoto enhanced it with something not available at the time the 
great pacific war first appeared massed aircraft carriers and 
their planes the daring tactical innovation of japanese naval 
air chief minoru genda 
yamamoto followed bywater so assiduously in both overall 
strategy and specific tactics at pearl harbor guam the 
philippines and even the battle of midway that it is no 
exaggeration to call hector bywater the man who invented the 
pacific war honan adds 
unlike more optimistic imperial admirals yamamoto hedged when 
his government tried to assess japanese prospects in war with the 
united states quoting the late prime minister fumimaro konoyes 
dairy honan says yamamoto told his superiors if you insist on 
my going ahead i can promise to give them hell for a year or a 
year and a half but can guarantee nothing beyond 
this was as if yamamoto had cribbed his answer from the great 
pacific war in which japanese strength declines after 18 months 
of war against an aroused america honan continues 
the us navy also drew on bywaters thinking honan says 
bywater knocked some sense into the americans with two 
chapters of the great pacific war exposing weaknesses of the 
us contingency war plan in which the navy would rush 
reinforcements across a hostile ocean in a reckless effort at quick 
recovery of the philippines he says 
bywater had the us fleet getting intercepted severely mauled 
and humbled prompting the united states to redesign a carefully 
planned stepbystep advance to manila across a bridge of islands 
in the marshall and caroline chains it was the first time a naval 
expert had publicly spelled out such a campaign of amphibious 
landings says honan 
honan raises but leaves unanswered a question of whether 
japanese agents caused the mid1940 deaths of bywater then 55 in 
a london suburb and bywaters tokyo source english journalist 
melville cox 
an autopsy hampered by german air raids during the battle of 
britain found that bywater died of a heart attack and 
overdrinking cox died in a fall or jump from a window at tokyo 
police headquarters 
honan says london daily telegraph correspondent ea harwood 
theorized in 1987 that yamamoto ordered the deaths of bywater and 
cox shortly after committing himself to the pearl harbor attack to 
keep the two englishmen from alerting the united states to his war 
plan 
bywater and yamamoto had met at the 1934 london naval conference 
where honan records they spent one evening together debating 
the future over a bottle of good scotch 
admiral yamamoto was killed when his plane was shot down in 
1943

the bush administration is readying a plan to 
provide weapons needed immediately to protect oilrich saudi arabia 
and the american soldiers serving there says secretary of state 
james a baker iii 
the first phase of a twopart package will be sent to congress 
for approval early this week baker said sunday 
baker refused to put a price tag on the package but other 
sources said the first installment will total 10 billion with the 
full plan valued at around 21 billion the second part is expected 
to be sent to congress early next year 
president bush agreed to submit the weapons proposal in two 
installments after members of congress particularly those close to 
israel objected to the size of the deal but baker appearing on 
nbctvs meet the press insisted bush was not revising his 
plans for the saudis 
no the president has not backed off that baker said when 
asked the administrations position on the 21 billion package 
the package however will be phased 
several members of congress said they would be willing to 
support the 10 billion plan in an election year but next years 
package could face a tougher time 
the weapons sale would be the largest in history the previous 
record was an 8 billion package that also went to the saudis 
the first installment will represent the needs that we think 
are immediate for saudi arabia and frankly needs that would 
serve to protect american lives baker said 
about 150000 american soldiers have been deployed in saudi 
arabia since iraq invaded neighboring kuwait on aug 2 baker did 
not say specifically what the pentagon wants to send the saudis 
but the initial items are expected to include material the united 
states could send quickly like antitank missiles and trucks 
the second phase would include more sophisticated weapons such 
as the m1 tank f15 fighter jets and apache helicopters 
saudi government representative fred dutton said that country 
was not upset at the administrations decision to split the package 
in two as a result of the gulf crisis the saudis are enlarging 
and restructuring their defenses by calling up volunteers and 
beefing up oil field security 
after the dust clears they will see what their defense 
requirements are he said if the saudis cant get what they want 
from the united states theyll shop elsewhere he said saudi 
arabia is viewed as a good customer because it pays cash for 
weapons 
baker meanwhile stressed the us desire to resolve the gulf 
crisis peacefully through diplomatic means taking direction from 
the united nations 
this week baker will join other foreign ministers at a un 
security council meeting in new york where they will discuss 
options including a possible air embargo against iraq 
un secretary general javier perez de cuellar said sunday he 
wouldnt be surprised if an air embargo is approved this week 
an air embargo plus sanctions against countries that violate 
the existing un embargo against iraq are just two of the 
nonmilitary measures at the united nations disposal baker said 
as he played down the threat of war 
i dont think were running out of nonmilitary type 
sanctions he said i think there are a whole host of other 
things that might be considered 
nevertheless baker said the united states would have an 
appropriate response to any iraqiinspired acts of terrorism 
against american citizens and would act unilaterally if necessary 
bush has accused iraqi president saddam hussein of supporting 
terrorist groups 
on other related issues baker also 
said the united states and its allies will accept nothing short 
of a complete withdrawal of iraqi troops from kuwait and 
restoration of the kuwaiti government before it considers 
negotiating with saddam 
defended the administrations actions before saddams invasion 
of kuwait he reiterated that the united states followed the proper 
course in refusing to take sides in the iraqkuwait border dispute 
and said it was ludicrous to suggest that somehow the united 
states contributed to saddam husseins unprovoked aggression 
against kuwait

governors in kentucky invariably try to 
handpick their successors in a bid to sidestep the state ban on 
serving successive terms 
the ploy hasnt worked in nearly 30 years but that hasnt 
stopped democratic gov wallace wilkinson his wife is among a 
field of candidates who have raised over 5 million for a primary 
election that wont take place until next may 
the gubernatorial candidates have raked in so many contributions 
that democrats running in state legislative races this year 
complain they are feeling the money pinch 
martha wilkinson recently took in 11 million at a single 
event critics say most of her money comes from people who depend 
on state government for their livelihoods 
it is strictly voluntary there is no quote pressure 
wilkinson said of the contributions to his wifes campaign 
she insists she is not a surrogate candidate for her husband 
and he says that she makes up her own mind about what she wants 
to do and she goes and does it 
mrs wilkinson refuses to answer questions about her candidacy 
or her husbands administration her husband said voters dont want 
to hear about issues but at some point she must address a 13 
billion tax increase enacted this year for education and other 
state programs the hottest topic so far on the campaign trail 
at one time wilkinson toyed with joining his wife on the ticket 
as a candidate for lieutenant governor but talk of the idea has 
died 
the constitutional ban on governors succeeding themselves in 
kentucky traditionally has brought large fields of candidates whose 
campaigns begin months sometimes years before the election 
besides wilkinsons wife the democratic campaigners include 
lt gov brereton jones who once served in the state house in 
west virginia as a republican 
dr floyd g poore who left the wilkinson administration after 
publicly claiming that his capitol telephone had been bugged 
gatewood galbraith who says no new state taxes would be needed 
if the state legalized marijuana and regulated it galbraith has 
drawn few contributions but has reportedly enlisted the aid of 
country singer willie nelson to help raise money 
scotty baesler the threeterm mayor of lexington who refuses 
to rule out the possibility of additional taxes he has raised 
814000 for his campaign 
jones who has raised more than 2 million for his campaign 
dates his political conversion to the watergate scandal 
dick nixon made a democrat out of me says jones 
candidates for governor and lieutenant governor do not run as a 
team in kentucky and jones and wilkinson have feuded from the time 
they took office 
jones drew heavily on a personal fortune to outdistance a 
bloated field in his 1987 primary in this campaign he promises no 
new taxes but poore links wilkinson and jones accusing them of 
conspiring to pass the tax increase 
poore has vowed to lead a tax revolt and get the general 
assembly to roll back part of the 13 billion tax increase poore 
has not said what he would cut from the budget to compensate 
saying details will come later 
a physician poore was state transportation secretary under gov 
martha layne collins and a front office assistant to wilkinson but 
collins fired him after he championed an increase in the motor 
fuels tax 
poore helped raise millions of campaign dollars for collins and 
wilkinson according to his last campaign finance report his own 
campaign had taken in 11 million 
on the republican side there is 
state rep john harper who carried the republican banner in 
1987 and was beaten in 115 of the states 120 counties he lost by 
the biggest margin in kentucky history 
truckpull promoter leonard buck beasley reprising his 
1987 candidacy in which he finished third in the gop primary 
the best republican hope is us rep larry hopkins a former 
state legislator who was publicly urged by president bush to take 
the gubernatorial plunge 
the veteran congressman is weighing the chances of becoming the 
first republican elected governor in nearly a quarter century

the 8yearold grandson of camp allen elementary principal 
delores fitzgerald was convinced that poison gas would seep into 
his classroom if iraqi president saddam hussein carried out his 
threat to wage a chemical war 
he said gee that could come over here couldnt it 
because he had no idea how far iraq is or whats involved in 
fighting with chemicals said fitzgerald 
the principal of the camp allen school in norfolk va was 
describing what classroom teachers face when trying to keep 
schoolchildren abreast of rapidly escalating events in the persian 
gulf 
maps and globes of the persian gulf are becoming frequent 
reference points in classrooms across the nation as teachers focus 
on chessgame movements in iraq saudi arabia and kuwait 
but teachers also must reassure students who dont understand 
the threats of chemical war or those whose parents are among the 
165000 us military personnel in the region 
children are exposed to a lot of things they are not simply 
mature enough to understand said fitzgerald pointing to 
television and newspaper coverage of the crisis 
more than 90 percent of camp allens 774 students are military 
dependents fitzgerald said about 200 of them have one or both 
parents deployed overseas either to the persian gulf or 
elsewhere 
fitzgerald said the prekindergarten through fifth grade school 
is adding information to its entire curriculum on middle eastern 
customs the type of government weather and economics some of the 
teaching strategies were provided during special training sessions 
held by the navy family services 
the school also holds about 17 small group sessions once a week 
for students with parents overseas fitzgerald said 
kids always have problems when a parent is deployed even if 
its for a six or ninemonth exercise in peacetime said 
fitzgerald noting that teachers are trained to look for unusual 
behavior such as a childs reluctance to leave home or reluctance 
to leave school 
richard bowers coordinator of psychological services for the 
norfolk public schools said his staff of 21 psychologists has 
developed special strategies for helping students who are 
experiencing anxiety about the persian gulf crisis 
i cant say weve had an influx of referrals said bowers 
but we try to be preventive we try to stay ahead of crisis so 
it wont get away from us 
janie smalls a guidance counselor at shell point elementary in 
beaufort sc said a small group has been formed called dad is 
gone for children with fathers overseas videotapes are being 
made to send to the fathers and officials are talking to mothers 
about how to reassure their children 
smalls said some children may misbehave go through emotional 
withdrawal or perform poorly in school due to a parents absence 
at holbrook elementary at ft bragg nc teachers put together 
an elaborate middle eastern display for the main trophy case 
including maps clothing and a wellworn camel saddle classes are 
being brought periodically to the exhibit for a lesson on the 
middle east 
maps of the persian gulf came out of the closet all of a 
sudden and many students showed an interest in middle eastern 
culture said dick phebus principal of battery creek high school 
in beaufort twenty percent of the schools 1150 students are from 
military families at the marine corps air station 
principal della a zaher of miami shores elementary school in 
dade county fla vividly remembers her conversation with a 
frightened fifth grader who said a war could end the earth 
weve tried to treat this as a very important national issue 
but we dont want to alarm anyone kids worry about bombs about 
members of the family sent overseas its the unknown thats 
frightful we want to eliminate misinformation she said 
the plan zaher said is to give students as much information as 
possible the 970 summer school students attentively watched 
televised coverage of president bushs first news conference on the 
crisis 
with regular school back in session zaher said a 
studentproduced news program for the 1600member student body 
almost always includes events in the persian gulf 
we thrive on the fact that we keep our kids informed said 
zaher whose awardwinning kindergarten through fifth grade school 
has a student body that is about 50 percent haitian 22 percent 
white and the rest black and hispanic

the average price of a gallon of gasoline at 
the pump has hit an alltime high of more than 138 an industry 
analyst says 
the price has gone up from around 118 in late july shortly 
before iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 and jumped 291 cents 
in the two weeks since the previous survey said the nationwide 
lundberg survey of 18500 gas stations 
the fears are that a war could create a serious supply 
upheaval and that supply replacement could be difficult said 
trilby lundberg 
the twicemonthly survey conducted last week showed motorists 
were paying an average of 13835 per gallon up from 13544 on 
sept 7 ms lundberg said sunday 
the previous record was just under 138 set in march 1981 she 
said 
analysts cited continued fear of war in the middle east among 
reasons for the surge in crude oil prices on the new york 
mercantile exchange on friday 
the price of crude for october delivery rose 153 a barrel to 
3471 the highest level in nine years 
lundbergs survey showed that at selfservice pumps on average

a group of leading environmental organizations 
is trying to break into one of americas richest sources of funding 
the annual workplace charity campaigns widely identified with the 
united way 
the 23member environmental federation of america has 
participated in federal state and city government employee charity 
campaigns in the two years since its founding 
now it is trying to get its foot in the door of corporate 
payroll deduction campaigns as well 
kal stein the federations executive director said he hopes to 
be raising 400 million a year for environmental causes within 10 
years this years goal is a more modest 7 million 
we dont want to hurt united way we want to complement what 
they do stein told reporters recently 
stein said research showed that when employees are given more 
options in a workplace charity drive they increase their giving 
with united way getting as much as before 
in fact united way charities generally did better than their 
average when faced with multiple choice campaigns says a 
statement prepared by the federation 
that is not our experience responded tony de cristofaro 
spokesman for united way of america in alexandria va when there 
are multiple groups competing there are fewer dollars for local 
health and human needs 
de cristofaro said the 1400 local united way campaigns make 
their own decisions about what groups qualify to share in workplace 
donations 
in some places environmental causes are included in other 
places they are not he said in an interview clearly people in 
the local community know best whats needed 
local leaders of many united way campaigns have been taking a 
new look at what sorts of charities should be included de 
cristofaro said 
united ways need to examine what theyre doing in the light of 
what donors want to do he said what the communities have been 
counting on us to do is deal with the priority health and human 
services needs in the communities 
stein said his new national organization was affiliated with 
similar environmental federations set up in recent years in 
california oregon and washington to participate in workplace 
charity campaigns 
one of the environmental federation of americas first campaigns 
among workers at a private business will be carried out this year 
at the washington law firm arnold and porter which has about 1000 
employees 
james w jones the firms managing partner said the decision 
to participate was intended to give employees a wider range of 
choices and to help identify arnold and porter with environmental 
protection 
environmental concerns if not the issue of the 1990s is 
going to be one of the issues of the 1990s he said 
the 23 groups that make up the federation include the wilderness 
society friends of the earth the environmental defense fund the 
natural resources defense council the national audubon society and 
the sierra club legal defense fund 
donations can be designated for a particular group of the money 
that is not earmarked half is divided equally among the 23 
federation members and the rest is split up in proportion to how 
often each group was designated by other donors 
stein said the federations administration costs were about 8 
percent of total donations 
participating groups are required to meet standards on financial 
accounting and on policy stein said for example groups 
advocating illegal direct action are not accepted 
treespikers need not apply he said 
the federation expects to add a limited number of new groups 
each year and is not sure how it will respond to expected 
applications from organizations with an environmental connection 
but a primary focus on animal rights peace energy or some other 
topic 
this is a tough question deciding what is an environmental 
group stein said that will evolve on a casebycase basis

donations and concessional sales of food to 
needy countries has been a largescale operation since world war 
ii but an agriculture department report says humanitarian concerns 
have not always been the prime motive 
food aid policies and programs are changing the report 
said donor nations including the united states are putting 
more emphasis on the needs of the recipient countries and less on 
their own domestic concerns 
the report published in farmline magazine was based on studies 
by shahla shapouri and margaret missiaen of the departments 
economic research service 
an objective of the study was to determine to what extent food 
aid programs were designed as an outlet for surplus commodities as 
a means of developing new markets or as help for people in need 
internal policies also play a part in determining a countrys 
food aid to foreigners the report said 
for example farmers may favor cutbacks in production to keep 
commodity prices relatively high but foreign policy planners may 
want greater bumper crops and lower prices in order to help third 
world countries that are strategically important 
the economists looked at the food aid programs of the united 
states canada and the european community which have been the 
primary sources of world food assistance since the early 1970s 
over the years they found food aid has grown more 
humanitarian as emphasis has shifted more heavily to the needs 
of recipients 
also there has been an expansion of multilateral assistance 
through such organizations as the world food program of the united 
nations about onefourth of the grain moving as food aid is now 
supplied multilaterally 
the united states continues to provide more than half of the 
grain aid to foreign aid recipients although the tonnage has 
declined in recent years also the us share in relation to 
donations by canada and the ec has declined 
canadas food aid programs like those of the united states 
were established largely to dispose of surplus production the 
report said 
but canadas aid has been donated while most of the us food 
assistance has been concessional sales including longterm 
lowinterest credit arrangements 
in 1975 major recipients of us food aid included bangladesh 
28 percent india 28 percent pakistan 19 percent and egypt 14 
percent all other countries had shares of 4 percent or less 
by 1985 the biggest were egypt 29 percent and sudan 7 
percent other us food recipients had shares of 6 percent or 
less 
the most powerful common factors affecting food aid assignment 
by the united states canada and the 12nation community to certain 
countries were a trend of low food production and an economic 
relationship with the donor country the report said 
trading relations between the needy country and the donor also 
influenced aid it said countries that had stronger trade ties 
with the donor countries were more likely to receive assistance 
for example the united states has directed aid toward latin 
american and caribbean countries with which it has strong trade 
relations the report said canada has assisted fellow members 
of the commonwealth of nations and the ec has helped former 
colonies of member countries 
 
washington ap the agriculture department has scheduled two 
public meetings on whether to declare melaleuca quinquenervia a 
federal noxious weed 
the question seems to be is it friend or foe 
melaleuca is described as a nonnative tree that was 
introduced in florida in the early 1900s it was widely planted in 
the 1940s and 1950s because of its ability to control soil erosion 
and for natural fences and windbreaks 
beekeepers also like melaleuca because it flowers when few 
other plants do thus helping bees through the winter said the 
departments animal and plant health inspection service 
but florida officials are concerned that uncontrolled spread of 
the melaleuca species could threaten rare plants and animals 
interfere with water supplies and eventually jeopardize the 
everglades said james w glosser administrator of the usda 
agency 
public comments will help us decide whether to issue a rule 
proposing to add melaleuca to the list of noxious weeds he said 
if it is added to the list federal restrictions would be 
authorized on imports and interstate movement of the plant 
the tree covers about 15 million acres in southern florida he 
said in addition to plantings in california hawaii texas and 
puerto rico 
public meetings will be held oct 29 in fort lauderdale fla 
and on oct 31 in san francisco 
a notice was scheduled for publication today in the federal 
register the governments official rulemaking document 
comments can be sent by nov 24 to chief regulatory analysis

the world bank says it is learning from past 
environmental mistakes as it draws up plans for new third world 
development projects 
the 152nation body has been accused of financing largescale 
destruction of rain forests river valleys and other sensitive 
ecosystems issuing its first annual report on sunday the bank 
said nearly half of last years new loans will do something to help 
the environment 
procedures set up last year should assure new projects are not 
environmentally and socially destructive it said 
the bank must ensure that the lessons of past problems are 
quickly reflected in future policy adjustments the report said 
the world bank lends about 20 billion each year at low interest 
rates to encourage development in poor and middleincome countries 
its report acknowledges that in the mid1980s there were a few 
wellpublicized cases in which bank projects actually had negative 
environmental consequences such as contributing to the 
destruction of tropical rain forests and posing threats to 
wildlife indigenous people and established human settlements 
a coalition of international environmental groups said the 
report was intended to deflect public criticism of the world 
banks role in the degradation of the global environment 
kenneth piddington the banks environment director told a news 
conference his goal was to make sure environmental concerns are 
addressed early in the pipeline of project consideration by 
world bank economists not just later by his staff 
we are working as an environmental team piddington said 
we do not make the claim that having made some progress we have 
avoided all the problems 
since last october borrowing countries have been required to 
draw up environmental assessments for any new projects that will 
have significant environmental impacts 
the report covering the fiscal year ended in june 1990 said 11 
loans totaling 4039 million were approved last year exclusively 
for environmental projects up from just two loans in fiscal 1989 
the projects range from helping poland develop air and water 
pollution control policies to funding a comprehensive environmental 
program in madagascar 
funding for 45 more such projects is expected in the next three 
years 
in addition the report said 107 of last years 222 new loans 
or 48 percent have some environmental component 
examples cited include energy conservation measures that are 
part of an electricity project in brazil pollution controls on a 
petrochemical development project in india and improving vehicle 
emission controls in a highway project in mauritius 
the environmental report was issued in connection with this 
weeks annual meetings of the 152nation world bank and its sister 
organization the international monetary fund 
about 150 representatives of international development and 
environmental groups critical of world bank projects also are 
meeting in washington to protest what they see as the banks 
abuses 
the assembly called the peoples network for eco development 
issued a statement calling the report a blatant exercise in 
misinformation 
emmy hafild of the indonesian environmental forum said it was 
nothing more than a green gimmick designed to mislead the public 
and quell criticism

senate republican leader bob dole is again 
displaying one of the reasons he has never been successful in 
seeking national office he wants to get things done 
i think the american people are tired of us sitting around and 
sitting around and doing nothing dole said sunday defending his 
suggestion that gop budget negotiators set aside president bushs 
pledge to cut capital gains taxes 
his move shook things up but it was no surprise it was vintage 
dole having fought for months to win a party victory it now was 
time to pass some legislation 
its an attitude that dole needed when republicans controlled 
the senate for six years in the early and mid 1980s including two 
with dole as the majority leader its also an attitude that can 
cost a politician dearly 
doles legendary nasty streak usually gets the blame for his 
failures 
that urge caused him to blurt out in a 1976 debate with fellow 
vice presidential candidate walter mondale that the united states 
was always fighting democrat wars the comment helped topple 
the gop ticket headed by president ford 
and in 1988 after losing in the new hampshire primary to bush 
he caustically told the victor to stop lying about my record 
it was an ugly display that helped collapse doles stillpromising 
campaign 
bushs campaign succeeded in tagging dole with the fatal label 
of taxraiser because dole was and is a master of cutting deals in 
congress including deficitreduction packages in the early 1980s 
that included tax increases 
although president reagan signed those bills vice president 
bushs fingerprints werent on them and whatever stands he took as 
a congressman two decades ago were too remote to do him any harm 
during the campaign 
now doles presidential hopes having slipped to hopeless he 
again seems to be the one to get something done acknowledging 
that the result is bound to have unpopular elements that could cost 
its supporters politically 
dole bolted from the bushled gop position that any 
deficitreduction agreement had to include a capital gains tax cut 
but not because he opposed the idea its just that to him it 
wasnt worth four months of budget talks coming to naught 
specifically dole suggested taking capital gains out of the 
basic deficitreduction package and putting it and other 
goodies into a separate bill for a separate congressional vote 
he didnt have to point out that the move would hurt chances of 
passing the capital gains cut dole is one of those oldfashioned 
republicans who still believes in balanced budgets and that is a 
higher priority to him than the supplyside economics adopted by 
many in his party including bush 
my view is we need to get this done we ought to stop dancing 
around capital gains face up to it get it resolved and get this 
package put to bed he said sunday on cbstvs face the 
nation program 
i think were losing sight of what we got together for thats 
deficit reduction now with all the focus on capital gains we 
better get back to deficit reduction or were going to have some 
real problems he said 
dole took a similar position last year when congress was trying 
to wrap up its session and the democratic leadership was 
successfully blocking a capital gains tax cut the white house on 
advice from dole gave up to fight another day 
the bottom line is that dole is a player a lawmaker who 
knows how the legislative sausagefactory works and is sometimes 
willing to settle for legislation that is less than perfect its 
an attitude that draws plaudits within congress but not so much 
outside the capitol 
even within congress dole draws the ire of purists such as rep 
newt gingrich rga who once called dole the tax collector for 
the liberal welfare state 
gingrich now is the house minority whip and one of the gop 
budget negotiators he is getting a taste of the political choices 
dole has faced for years dole must be savoring the possibilities

newly released figures illustrate the need for 
greater efforts to prevent teenage pregnancies says a report by a 
group that concentrates on worldwide population issues 
the report released sunday said the federal government spent 
more than 215 billion last year on welfare programs for families 
started by teenagers the amount is 17 billion higher than for 
1988 partly because of inflation and expansion of medicaid 
benefits but also due to an increase in births to teenagers said 
report by the private center for population options 
the group said the report pointed to a need for greater efforts 
to curb teen pregnancies including sex education family planning 
counseling support for delaying sexual activity access to 
contraception and medical services including abortion 
we can no longer let our youth stumble into parenting a 
course that should be embarked on only when one is ready willing 
and able to become a parent the report said 
the costs of teenage pregnancies go far beyond those of public 
support the report said 
tooearly childbearing often impoverishes the lives of 
girls brought too soon into the rigors and responsibilities of 
motherhood of boys bewildered and unable to parent and provide 
adequately of babies not planned or welcomed the report said

the washington post has branded as 
unwarranted the arrest of one of its reporters charged with 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor while pursuing a story 
on a youth curfew 
michael j ybarra 23 a post metro staff reporter was arrested 
late friday while working on a report about a new curfew for minors 
in quantico va 
based on the information we have the arrest of a washington 
post reporter while he is reporting a story and breaking no law 
himself appears unwarranted to us post managing editor leonard 
downie jr said 
im particularly concerned that the police pursued this after 
the reporter identified himself and his purpose and that the police 
took his notes downie said 
ybarra was taken into custody and his notes confiscated while he 
was interviewing two 12yearold boys in a restaurant in the 
virginia town about 30 miles south of the nations capital 
the quantico town council recently imposed the 10 pm to 6 am 
curfew for youths under age 18 following recent vandalism in the 
area 
ybarra is the second adult charged in connection with a curfew 
violation but no youths have been arrested 
i believe that the reporter was trying to do his job and just 
got mixed up at the wrong place and the wrong time quantico 
police chief leo rodriguez said 
the police chief said the reporters notes were being held as 
evidence but a copy would be made available to the post 
ybarra was released on his own recognizance and is to be 
arraigned in prince william county juvenile and domestic relations 
court on tuesday he faces a maximum oneyear jail term and a 
2500 fine

here are excerpts from the communique 
issued sunday after a joint meeting of iraqs ruling revolution 
command council and baath party the arabic statement was 
translated by the associated press 
 
america is commiting deep criminal acts against iraq and the 
ara nation especially in occupying the arab and moslem holy places 
in najd and hejaz the former name for the territory that became 
saudi arabia and in its sanctions imposed against the iraqi 
people in a way that exceeds all humanitarian limits 
the united states thus has gone far below the minimum level of 
human standards toward which even those who believe in the law of 
the jungle would not stop 
america did all this to satisfy its arrogance and enforce its 
hegemony on the entire world 
america must not go too far and must get out of its mind the 
idea of pushing events into a military collision and it must 
realize the dangers of what it calls a lightning strike 
it should also abandon all this and remedy it as soon as 
possible by returning to the innermost parts of itself so as to 
search for remnants of wisdom to aid it so as to turn away from 
this dangerous approach as soon as possible primarily it should 
withdraw from the holy lands of the arabs and moslems 
america must realize clearly that it is pushing the entire 
region and not only iraq in fact even the whole world foremost 
of which its sons whom president bush brought to the region to 
the brink of a bottomless abyss from which the region will never 
see light for dozens of years 
the oil the areas it is in and israel will be transformed into 
something different from what they are now 
we will never allow anybody whomever he may be to strangle the 
people of iraq without having himself strangled if we feel that 
the iraqi people are being strangled that there are some who will 
deal a sanguinary blow to it we will strangle all those who are 
the cause of this 
the oil areas in saudi arabia and in other states of the region 
all the oil installations will be rendered incapable of responding 
to the needs of those who came to us as occupiers in order to usurp 
our sovereignty dignity and wealth 
israel will be included in all actions that affect the owners of 
the homeland in which the forces of evil and occupation have 
settled and in which nothing has maintained its purity except for 
the holy places and the generous people who reject this injustice 
and aggression 
those who wish the flood to overtake the iraqi people and the 
nation and are planning for this should remember well that the 
waves of the flood will overwhelm them before they overwhelm the 
iraqi people 
america and those who instigated it or collaborated with it 
should realize this well so as to reassess matters and to think 
again in the correct and precise manner upon which they should 
build the reckless odious and foolish behavior that has occurred 
so far should be enough for them 
everybody should also realize that what we have warned against 
might happen when the sparks come out of the barrels of confronting 
guns and out of the friction of the fleets of aggression with our 
means and forces 
the sparks might fly by mistake or deliberately to afterward 
cause a huge conflagration when this happens a flood will ensue 
to prevent the feared eventuality from taking place those 
concerned should pull back armies as well as navy and air fleets as 
soon as possible 
dire consequences will befall those who love to create wars 
problems and crises they will also befall evildoers and back 
stabbers 
as for the arabs who are launching good offices they are urged 
not to replace the solution that we offered on 12th august with a 
partial solution as turning the conflict from one concerning major 
issues into one regarding minor issues benefits the tactics of the 
enemies and their supporters 
the major issue concerns the struggle of the arabs and mosless 
in their righteous jihad holy war against falsehood the prime 
objective is the liberation of palestine from the usurpation of the 
zionist usurpers 
iraqs adherence to this position through an unequivocal 
declared policy has caused the evil arrows to be directed against 
it and caused the poisonous wasps to leave their holes to sting its 
sides and cause them to bleed in the most dangerous conspiracy that 
seeks to inflict political and economic harm on iraq to prepare for 
the military weakening of iraq and also for the weakening of its 
nationalist panarab and humanitarian role 
the conspiracy and those behind it have been exposed at the 
forefront of those charged with staging the conspiracy were the 
former rulers of kuwait who used kuwait which was separated from 
iraq as a base for a counterconspiracy they have massed its 
stolen resources to serve everything that would bring evil and 
disgrace to the national and islamic struggle 
the blow dealt to that evil ruling clique the agent of the

charlestons historic four corners of 
law is only threequarters occupied these days 
charleston countys 198yearold courthouse which is on one of 
those corners stands empty its windows still taped to protect 
them from hurricane hugo one year ago 
it might appear that the building on the foundation of south 
carolinas first statehouse has been forgotten since the stomms 
135 mph winds ripped off the roof 
looks are deceiving 
plans are under way to renovate the historic courthouse at 
meeting and broad streets charlestons most famous intersection 
buildings at the intersections four corners st michaels 
episcopal church city hall the federal courthouse and the county 
courthouse represent gods law as well as city federal and state 
law 
some historians say james hoban the charleston architect who 
designed the first white house drew heavily on the courthouse in 
his design the original white house was burned by the british in 
the war of 1812 
before hugo architect dinos liollio was hired to study 
renovation of the courthouses exterior after hugo the work was 
expanded to include interior renovations replacing the roof and 
reinforcing the building to withstand earthquakes 
the county in the meantime moved its courts to north 
charleston 
renovations may cost about 55 million and take more than a 
year when plans are complete but the exterior should remain much 
as it is 
as for the interior we dont know at this time the building 
has to respond to the needs of the 21st century although it was 
built in the 18th century liollio said 
the original 1792 courthouse was modified in 1884 an addition 
built in the 1920s and another in 1941 liollio said 
hugo wrenched the roof off and left an inch of water covering 
the floors it wasnt the first disaster the courthouse survived 
an earthquake in 1886 caused heavy damage and toppled its 
chimneys there was talk of razing the building at the time but 
repairs were made 
the original statehouse was built on the site in 1753 under the 
foundation are the original walls of charleston the structure 
burned in 1788 two years after the decision to move the capital to 
columbia and a year before construction began on the statehouse 
there liollio said 
when a new building was finished in charleston residents 
continued calling it the statehouse in hopes the legislature might 
one day return from columbia 
for a time state functions were split between the cities the 
secretary of state and surveyor general had offices in both cities 
and the state court of appeals met in both locations 
the governor could reside in either city although when the 
legislature was in session he had to reside in columbia 
a thunderstorm disrupted a candlelight observance friday at city 
hall to mark the first anniversary of hugo the ceremony drew about 
1000 people 
hugo killed 29 people and caused about 59 billion in damage in 
south carolina it also killed at least 56 people and caused more 
than 2 bllion in damage in the caribbean

iraq conducted secret military exercises for 
at least two years in preparation for its invasion of kuwait a 
newspaper reported today 
the invasion was part of a war plan drafted as many as five 
years ago by president saddam hussein that had as its goal the 
seizure of eastern saudi arabian oil fields the los angeles times 
said 
iraqi forces as recently as midjuly held exercises for forces 
used in the aug 2 helicopterborne assault on kuwait city the 
newspaper said citing unidentified us officials 
us officials have been accused of failing to predict the 
invasion even after iraqi forces began massing on the kuwaiti 
border weeks before the attack 
administration officials have said the intelligence community 
provided adequate warning that iraq was capable of attack but they 
say policymakers discounted the alert believing the buildup was 
only a show of force 
the united states was so illprepared for the invasion that us 
warships sent to the region after the attack waited days before 
maps of kuwait and iraq could be loaded into computers used for 
guiding weapons the officials said

the soviet legislature voted monday to reverse 
seven decades of communiststyle economics giving preliminary 
approval to a rescue plan for switching the soviet union to a free 
market economy 
members of the supreme soviet voted 32311 to endorse a 
blueprint for making the economic conversion within 500 days it 
was not immediately clear when the program would begin 
fiftysix legislators abstained from the historic vote 
there was no applause or other display of emotion when the 
electronic vote result was announced not even by president mikhail 
s gorbachev sitting alone on a raised stage in the chamber 
the lawmakers then began debating the resolution clause by 
clause they were to vote on possible amendments later monday 
the program would reverse the basic aim of the bolshevik 
revolution and stalins brutal collectivism whose legacy is an 
inefficient economy where food rots on its way to market and 
consumer shortages now include bread 
it would create a federation of republics with economies built 
on private businesses individually owned farms and stock markets 
trading shares in competitive companies 
the program marked a significant change in gorbachevs tactics 
his perestroika program had been aimed at restructuring 
centralized socialism but now is moving toward destroying it 
lawmakers had been scheduled to vote on the program on friday 
but failed to muster a quorum and had to adjourn to monday 
gorbachev had expressed frustration on friday saying there was 
no more time to talk think try and experiment 
the resolution endorses gorbachevs compromise economic program 
but also says the more conservative recipe drafted by prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov should be incorporated into it 
a third more radical plan has been adopted by the russian 
federation the largest of the 15 soviet republics with half the 
countrys people and threequarters of its territory 
previous attempts to merge the conflicting proposals have failed 
because they are so fundamentally different 
mondays resolution says a final detailed program should be 
presented to the supreme soviet by oct 15 it is to be developed 
by legislative committees and the authors of the various programs 
the soviet public has become increasingly disappointed in 
gorbachevs handling of the economic crisis and dozens of 
protesters chanted at lawmakers as they arrived for the morning 
debate 
the people dont trust gorbachev about a dozen 
demonstrators shouted outside the kremlins spassky gate they held 
signs that read a president not an emperor and all decrees 
of the president are battles against democracy 
gorbachev on friday requested sweeping new emergency powers to 
implement the economic program and restore law and order the 
supreme soviet was expected to vote on his request later monday

king hussein of jordan in a message published 
today said events in the persian gulf threaten to lead to reprise 
of 1914 when the world stumbled into a war it did not want but 
could not stop 
recalling the outbreak 76 years ago of world war i the king 
wrote in the guardian that he believes a war can still be 
prevented but he said if one breaks out it will be impossible to 
limit 
hussein has tried to walk a diplomatic tightrope during the 
crisis he has called for a negotiated solution denouncing the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait but refusing to support the usled 
military buildup standing up to iraq 
in a broadcast message to the american people the king declared 
saturday that his country would never recognize iraqs occupation 
of kuwait 
but he also urged the united states to get out of saudi arabia 
within the shortest period of time 
the guardian said it was publishing husseins remarks as a 
special message his words were published across the top of the 
dailys front page 
it is very disturbing that some believe military action is the 
only solution this is dangerously shortsighted wrote hussein 
the effects of a war against iraq will not be limited to the 
confines of that country 
they will reverberate in every capital throughout the middle 
east they will create the very instability such action was 
designed to prevent 
as for victors and spoils middle east wars have produced 
neither only graveyards for false illusions and the seeds for 
future wars the king wrote 
if the same effort by the world community in the present 
marshalling of military forces the imposition of sanctions and the 
commitment of colossal sums of money were to be applied to a 
political solution i am convinced it could be achieved 
jordan is sandwiched between israel syria iraq and saudi 
arabia 
it has been flooded with refugees from kuwait and iraq since the 
iraqi president saddam hussein ordered his troops into kuwait on 
aug 2 
a unordered embargo on trade with iraq has deprived jordan of 
desperately needed commerce 
in his message king hussein said many who live in the region 
feel helpless to prevent war 
but he wrote i am stubborn enough to believe there is still a 
chance to prevent war i refuse to concede that events cannot be 
brought under control 
the king said a peaceful solution would have to address what he 
called the major underlying causes of the crisis 
he listed these as the dispute between iraq and kuwait the 
imbalance of wealth in the area the unresolved confrontation 
between israel palestine and the arab states and the perilous 
escalation and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction 
saddam has linked a settlement of the crisis to an accord on the 
israelioccupied territories 
to attempt to solve the regions problems by military means 
treats only the symptoms not the causes and would aggravate 
problems the king said 
the area is exhausted from the conflicts and tensions it has 
endured for decades the middle east cannot afford another war 
the world should not impose one on it he said 
i am certain that it is not beyond the ingenuity of the 
leaders of this world to devise a peaceful solution to the crisis 
god help us if they cannot

critics say salman rushdies first book since 
irans call for his death a lighthearted fairy tale for children 
also carries a serious message for adults 
reviewers marveled sunday that rushdie could write with such 
mischievous humor despite 19 months in hiding under police guard 
during that time he has moved constantly and been separated from 
his wife the american novelist marianne wiggins 
most critics however also see signs of pain and desperation in 
the prose of haroun and the sea of stories 
the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini called for rushdies death 
after the authors novel the satanic verses was deemed 
blasphemous to islam 
the new book tells the tale of a hindu storyteller whose talent 
is suddenly destroyed by a fanatical dictator who poisons the 
springs of his inspiration the storytellers brave son haroun 
eventually defeats the enemy of stories and restores his fathers 
gift 
rushdie dedicates the book to his own son with these lines 
as i wander far from view 
read and bring me home to you 
british writer anthony burgess reviewing the book in the 
observer newspaper said the dedication renews rage at the 
stupidity of the islamic deathmongers burning a book they do not 
have the intelligence to understand 
burgess called it a great tribute to the resilience of mr 
rushdies beleaguered spirit that he should write so charmingly 
funny a book 
it is a book to enjoy and not to explicate but if we wish we 
can take it as a piece of swiftian outrage at human folly disguised 
as a childrens tale burgess wrote 
rushdie a british citizen born into a moslem family in india 
was sentenced to death feb 14 1989 even after khomeinis death 
last year the sentence was not lifted by iranian leaders 
rushdie has since published poetry and several essays and 
reviews but haroun and the sea of stories is his first book 
since he went into hiding 
it will be published by granta books in britain on sept 27 and 
in the united states next year 
graham lord literary editor of the sunday express said rushdie 
has managed during his awful captivity to write a remarkably 
lighthearted almost mischievous childrens book 
but lord found poignant autobiographical shadows of rushdies 
own dreadful predicament especially in the remark of one 
character who said happy endings are much rarer in stories and 
also in life than most people think 
coming from rushdie in apparently unending captivity that 
sounds like a desperate cry echoing in the dark lord said 
david hughes in the mail on sunday said salman rushdie the 
flags of merriment flying throughout his allegory wins a grim 
fight of his own his fine book written in conditions in which 
such ebullience of mood takes courage is a great reechoing cry 
for freedom of word and view for the inarguable truth in a good 
story 
writer and critic marina warner reviewing the book in the 
sunday times which published several excerpts said rushdies 
jauntiness under sentence of death is matter for wonder 
enough but what is even more so is the absolutely unpompous 
treatment of the villains in the story

mixed in with the ads for trusses and 
carousel music in the 199th old farmers almanac are predictions 
for a cold snowy winter and advice on helping a baby grow put 
manure in the infants shoes 
the 224page 199th edition hits newsstands and supermarkets 
this week with its traditional weather predictions planting and 
tide tables anecdotes and folklor 
it claims 80 percent accuracy in its weather forecasts but 
editor and partowner judson hale says that figure is not cast in 
stone 
i cant in seriousness say 80 percent he said in a 
telephone interview from his dublin office he missed the midwest 
drought in 1988 
nevertheless the almanac is predicting a real oldfashioned 
winter east of the rockies with belownormal temperatures over 
much of the country except florida sections of the ohio and lower 
mississippi valleys and the northwest 
florida it predicts will have warmer than normal weather in 
february and march 
the almanac also forecasts a generally warmer spring and summer 
than normal but a cool and wet fall 
the almanac says its forecasts are based on a combination of a 
secret formula devised by its founder and the most modern 
scientific calculation based on solar activity 
hale also strays into earthquake forecasts noting that the moon 
will be 221545 miles from the earth on new years eve closer than 
its average of 251000 miles 
some people would believe it would have an influence on an 
earthquake if an earthquake was thinking about happening he 
said believers argue that when the moon is closer and its 
gravitational pull is stronger there is greater stress on rock 
layers that might rupture and cause a quake 
the almanac even offers folklore advice on babies on 
conception the almanac offers this folk wisdom if a woman lays 
her hat or coat on a strange bed she will have a child 
to have a boy she should hold a nickel in her mouth at the time 
of conception to make the baby grow tall folksters suggest 
putting manure in the childs shoes 
the yellowcovered old farmers almanac has changed little since 
it was first published in 1792 
the old farmers almanac is not to be confused with its upstart 
rival the farmers almanac which is about a third as thick 23 
years younger and is given away to businesses for advertising 
purposes 
the distinguishing trademark of the old farmers almanac is a 
hole in the corner put there at great expense and inconvenience 
its publishers say to preserve the tradition of hanging the book 
on a nail in the pantry or outhouse 
it does indicate it is in a sense a calendar hale says 
hale spent the summer scouring previous issues for lore to 
include in an expanded 200th anniversary edition next year 
im up to 1931 he said i have 65 pages of notes 
almanac readers will get a chance to contribute the essay topic 
for the 200th edition how the old farmers almanac has influenced 
my life

wounded in the legs was slashed about the face until he bled 
profusely and that his body was later paraded around liberias 
capital in a wheelbarrow and mutilated 
a ceasefire has been in place since saturday in monrovia the 
capital more than 5000 civilians have been killed in the 
conflict 
rebel leaders charles taylor and prince johnson will meet friday 
in freetown sierra leone for talks with us assistant secretary 
of state herman cohen said officials of the west african economic 
community cohen arranged the talks in meetings with the two rebels 
last week they said 
the french news agency agence francepresse said taylor 
announced a plan to hold elections oct 10 when he spoke at a news 
conference sunday in gbarnga 75 miles northeast of monrovia 
his army invaded from neighboring ivory coast in december 
accusing doe of mismanagement and corruption in running the country 
founded by freed american slaves in 1847 
johnson fought with taylors forces early on but the two men 
later had a fallingout and their forces have been battling one 
another as well as doe loyalists they both claim the presidency 
in an account in londons sunday observer newspaper a lebanese 
merchant from monrovia said he watched johnsons men torture doe 
after the president was captured during a battle sept 9 at the 
headquarters of a west african army the regional force was sent by 
the economic community nations to restore peace but it has been 
caught up in the fighting 
does hands were cuffed together and he had been shot in both 
legs and was bleeding heavily they were abusing him the 
merchant identified only as joseph was quoted as saying 
then one of johnsons men took a knife a machete and cut off 
his ear then they cut his face like this he told the newspaper 
indicating diagonal slashes across the cheeks he was crying and 
the blood was running down his cheeks from his face and head 
the man said doe at one point blew on the blood that had pooled 
on his body and one of johnsons men thought he was trying to do 
some kind of juju magic blowing on himself to make himself 
disappear 
so he shot him again the merchant said he was nearly 
dead then anyway from loss of blood 
the observer also quoted a liberian teacher identified only as 
oliver as saying he saw does body later in the day 
they had him in a wheelbarrow and were pushing the body around 
the town they were shouting weve killed doe and firing their 
guns in the air 
people were coming up to the body and cutting it with knives 
slashing at him he had two fingers maybe three missing from one 
hand and they had cut off his testicles the teacher said 
then they took his body to the island clinic for the first 
two or three days a lot of people were going to see it but then 
the smell got too bad oliver said 
both witnesses were interviewed in freetown 
their description was reminiscent of an october 1985 scene when 
doe put the mutilated body of brig gen thomas quiwonkpa on 
display in an open car that toured monrovia quiwonkpa has been 
captured after an attempt to overthrow doe

its incredible absolutely incredible said the rev marv 
l hartmann of bethel lutheran church which the family attended 
for 20 years then and now the whole community is just sick at 
heart 
the whole community has really been working together on

of kids that bothered him the most 
it was almost a lifestyle for bernie not a job hartmann

crash and later developed pneumonia he was 51 
its difficult accepting this sheeley said but bernie 
always told me that life isnt fair i guess he was right were 
all going to miss him very much

the homeless to eat outside saying he was worried that fleas and 
ticks from them would infest the salad bar but seifert insisted 
that they eat indoors

winnie mandela looking grim 
and tired was arraigned today on charges of assault and kidnapping 
stemming from a 1988 incident when four youths were allegedly taken 
to her house and beaten 
mrs mandela holding hands with her husband african national 
congress leader nelson mandela said nothing as she arrived at a 
city magistrates court she stood silently in the courtroom as her 
lawyers conferred with the magistrate and a trial date was set for 
feb 4 
mrs mandela wearing a black outfit was greeted by about 30 
cheering and singing anc women supporters as she left the court 
winnie winnie the women chanted as they tried to touch mrs 
mandela 
she smiled briefly before being whisked away by lawyers and 
aides 
one youth was killed and the former head of mrs mandelas 
bodyguards jerry richardson has been convicted of murder and 
sentenced to death in the same case the sentence is being 
appealed 
mrs mandela has denied any wrongdoing 
white and black leaders fear the trial will strain relations 
between the anc the leading antiapartheid group and the 
whiteled government as they try to start talks on extending 
political rights to the black majority 
mandela may be discredited in the eyes of militant young blacks 
who oppose negotiating with the government and will see his wifes 
trial as demeaning 
mrs mandela faces trial with seven members of her former 
bodyguard who have been charged on the same counts court officials 
say she faces four charges of kidnapping and four of assault with 
intent to commit grievous bodily harm 
mrs mandela was freed on her own recognizance bail for the 
other defendants was continued all eight will be tried together 
if convicted mrs mandela could face the death sentence 
lawyers said however that sentence has never been imposed for 
kidnapping they said 
mrs mandela has been plunged into a series of damaging public 
exposures mainly linked to the actions of her bodyguards called 
the mandela united football club the group which had little to do 
with soccer was composed of about two dozen aggressive teenagers 
in december 1988 four young blacks were kidnapped from a church 
home in soweto according to testimony at richardsons trial the 
four were taken to mrs mandelas soweto home and assaulted 
witnesses said 
stompie seipei 14 was killed the three survivors testified 
that mrs mandela participated in the beatings 
according to testimony mrs mandelas bodyguards accused seipei 
of being a police informer and the three others of having 
homosexual relations with the white minister who ran the church 
home where they lived 
no evidence has been presented that seipei was a police spy the 
youth was a wellknown antiapartheid activist 
the methodist church cleared the minister of any misconduct 
in other developments police said today at least 12 people died 
nationwide in new black factional fighting over the weekend 
about 800 people have been killed in such violence in the 
johannesburg area since august 
the fighting pits xhosas and other blacks loyal to the anc 
against zulus linked to the conservative inkatha movement the two 
groups oppose apartheid but differ over leadership and aims for a 
future south africa

i knew what i was getting into when 
i joined the navy three years ago but naturally im nervous 
said sailor lill mortensen the day she shipped out for the persian 
gulf 
ms mortensen 24 is one of 10 female sailors in the 100person 
crew aboard the corvette olfert fischer sent to middle east waters 
to help enforce a unordered embargo on trade with iraq 
norway belgium canada denmark and the netherlands are the 
only countries that assign women to offensive combat positions in 
their armed forces for the five nato members the gulf crisis 
could provide the first test of that policy 
of course its hard on the family to have to say goodbye 
said ms mortensen and luckily my boyfriend and i are used to 
being separated hes a submariner 
in addition to the 10 danes there are 24 women on board a dutch 
frigate that sailed for the gulf last month and 30 on the 
destroyer protecteur which canada sent to join the international 
armada 
american women though they make up 10 percent of the militarys 
personnel are restricted to noncombat roles 
danish laws enacted in the 1960s mandated sexual equality in the 
labor market and opened the way for women in the military but it 
wasnt until 1988 that women were allowed to train for combat and 
join fighting units 
air force capt sussie rasmussen calls sexual harassment or 
discrimination in the military no worse than one finds in other 
work places where women are introduced for the first time 
only two allmale bastions remain in denmarks military the 
cockpit of a jet fighter and aboard a submarine 
in norway women are assigned to submarines there are dutch 
female fighter pilots and there are no restrictions on belgian 
womens combat positions 
ms rasmussen calls the us restrictions on women odd 
i find it a paradox that us women sail on navy supply and 
ammunition ships and fly on awacs reconnaissance planes all 
obvious enemy targets in an armed conflict and yet are kept 
behind the battle lines she said 
when it comes to a your life or mine situation the female 
survival instinct is just as strong as the males 
norwegian women have had equal rights and duties with men in the 
armed forces since 1985 but women are exempt from the draft 
once they have volunteered they have exactly the same duties 
as men if they are in a combat unit they would go with it 
anywhere said col per boethun of the norwegian supreme defense 
command 
boethun said norway has women infantry sailors and pilots they 
fly military transports and would be allowed to fly fighters even 
in battle said boethun none however has qualified as a fighter 
pilot 
norwegian air force maj berit ovesen said some leaders hinder 
women from promotions or more training also some leaders think 
it doesnt pay to train women who are of childbearing age she 
said 
in the netherlands women make up about 2 percent of the 
120000member military and serve mostly in logistics and 
operations 
some are in combat units and if it comes down to fighting 
they will have to fight like men said dutch army spokesman wiebe 
alkema 
a belgian defense official said his countrys 3000 women 
volunteers have equal rights to any position or rank but few seek 
combat jobs 
a canadian human rights tribunal ruled in 1989 that all armed 
forces units except submarine crews must be open to women they 
now account for about 10 percent of the 87000member armed forces 
there has been at least one graduate from infantry training 
several from artillery they have armored people going through 
training now said capt ric jones a department of national 
defense spokesman 
asked whether women would be yanked out of combat in a shooting 
war jones said i cant answer that question but i dont expect 
so because when we employ a person we employ them they are 
treated as equals not specials

nikita khrushchev paid tribute to julius and 
ethel rosenberg for providing information that significantly helped 
the soviets develop an atomic bomb 
the ousted soviet leader also said a hotheaded fidel castro 
wanted the soviet union to attack the united states during the 
cuban missile crisis and josef stalin made a secret attempt to 
negotiate peace with adolf hitler during world war ii 
khrushchev remarks are contained in tapes he made during seven 
years of house arrest before his death in 1971 the tapes were 
acquired by time magazine and excerpts were published in the oct 
1 issue 
i was part of stalins circle when he mentioned the rosenbergs 
with warmth said khrushchev who was ousted in 1964 
i cannot specifically say what kind of help they gave us but 
i heard from both stalin and vyacheslav molotov then minister of 
foreign affairs that the rosenbergs provided very significant help 
in accelerating the production of our atom bomb he said let 
this be a worthy tribute to the memory of those people 
the rosenbergs son robert meeropol who has worked for years 
with his brother michael to clear their parents name called 
khrushchevs remarks wholly absurd 
the us government acknowledged that none of the material 
discussed at the trial was of any value said meeropol a 
43yearold lawyer in springfield mass who was 6 when his 
parents were executed in 1953 as spies 
krushchev said castro during the 1962 cuban missile crisis 
suggested that to prevent our nuclear missiles from being 
destroyed we should launch a preemptive strike against the us 
my comrades in the leadership and i realized that our friend 
fidel totally failed to understand our purpose we had installed 
the missiles not for the purpose of attacking the us but to keep 
the us from attacking cuba he said 
khrushchev said a desperate josef stalin made a very secret 
overture of peace to adolf hitler during world war ii stalin 
wanted to reach an agreement with hitler to let germany keep 
territory they occupied in the ukraine byelorussia and certain 
areas of the russian federation krushchev said 
i think it was in 1942 he said there was never any 
answer from hitler 
many of the tapes khrushchev made after his ouster were smuggled 
to the west and two volumes of memoirs were published in the 1970s 
his friends and relatives withheld some of the tapes fearing he 
had been too candid 
last year time magazine acquired those tapes another book 
khrushchev remembers the glasnost tapes is due out next month 
from little brown

in their most bellicose statement yet iraqs leaders have 
warned the usled forces arrayed against them that they would 
launch an allout war before allowing the un trade embargo to 
strangle the iraqi people 
they seemed for the first time to be threatening a first strike 
and mentioned israel and mideast oil fields as potential targets 
america must realize clearly that it is pushing the entire 
region in fact even the whole world to the brink of a 
bottomless abyss from which the region will never see light for 
dozens of years the iraqi communique said sunday 
it was signed by the revolution command council and the ruling 
baath party but bore the rhetorical imprint of president saddam 
hussein studded with references to poisonous wasps 
evildoers and zionist usurpers 
we will never allow anybody whomever he may be to strangle 
the people of iraq without having himself strangled the 
communique said 
last year iraq imported 75 percent of the food its people 
consumed now an international trade embargo ordered by the un 
security council in response to saddams aug 2 seizure of kuwait 
has prompted the baghdad government to begin rationing some 
staples 
the security council is expected to vote tuesday on an eighth 
resolution punishing iraq for refusing to relinquish kuwait the 
strictest yet it would block all air traffic in and out of iraq 
but planes carrying humanitarian aid 
the prospect of being even further cut off and ostracized likely 
contributed to the iraqi communiques acid tone 
those who wish the flood to overtake the iraqi people and the 
nation and are planning for this should remember well that the 
waves of the flood will overwhelm them before they overwhelm the 
iraqi people 
iraq further consolidated its hold on kuwait today by declaring 
the countrys currency the dinar invalid and withdrawn from 
circulation the official iraqi news agency said iraq would 
reimburse holders of the currency with iraqi dinars 
at the same time however iraq held out a small olive branch to 
france 
it offered a belated apology on sunday for the sept 14 raid on 
the french ambassadors residence in occupied kuwait during which 
the military attache and three other french citizens were arrested 
french interior minister pierre joxe today brushed aside 
baghdads apology for the raid excuses are fine he said on 
french radio but were waiting for iraq to let captive frenchmen 
leave in a normal manner 
the foreign ministry estimates 360 french citizens are held 
hostage in iraq and occupied kuwait along with about 1000 
americans and several thousand other westerners 
france responded to the raid by expelling iraqis from france and 
sending 4000 soldiers to saudi arabia as part of the usled 
multinational force 
the troops began arriving on sunday and their countrys 
president francois mitterrand was to address the opening session 
of the 45th un general assembly today 
iraq is expected to face a chorus of condemnation in three weeks 
of speeches by leaders to the world body which has gained a new 
vitality in its nearunanimous response to the crisis 
but there may be no iraqis present 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz said sunday that iraq would 
not participate in the session because the state department had 
refused to allow iraqi airways to fly aziz and his entourage to new 
york 
a state department official said the matter was still being 
considered but it would seem inappropriate to grant permission 
for the iraqi foreign minister to fly his plane to the united 
states while hundreds of americans citizens are being held against 
their will in iraq and kuwait 
a plane carrying 112 evacuees from iraq and kuwait landed in 
raleigh nc sunday night from london the state department said 
it was the last uschartered airlift planned from iraq which is 
holding foreign males as human shields at strategic installations 
to discourage a possible attack 
the iraqi communique appeared to rule out even the suggestion of 
compromise calling the invasion of kuwait a defensive move 
necessary to achieve baghdads wellknown noble objectives 
it warned that dire consequences would befall 
backstabbers an apparent reference to the arab nations that 
oppose saddam syria has committed 20000 troops to the force 
standing up to iraq egypt has promised 15000 
three egyptian navy ships carrying new troops and gear to saudi 
arabia passed through the suez canal on sunday 
the iraqi communique broadcast by staterun media threatened 
to render incapable the oil area in saudi arabia and in other 
states of the region it said the oil the areas it is in and 
israel will be transformed into something different from what they 
are now 
the communique said saddams aug 12 statement that he would 
only quit kuwait if israel turns the occupied territories over to 
the palestinians was the only basis for negotiations 
in so saying it appeared to chide jordans king hussein for 
trying to broker an arabsponsored peace 
as for the arabs who are launching good offices the 
communique said they are urged not to replace the solution that 
we offered on aug 12 with a partial solution 
secretary of state james a baker iii interviewed on nbctvs 
meet the press was asked about the possibility of war 
we have said many times we hoped there wont be he replied 
but added president bush was not ruling out any options 
in another gulfrelated developments south korea said today 
that it would donate 220 million in military and humanitarian aid 
to multinational defense efforts in the gulf 
the amount falls short of the reported 450 million originally 
requested by the united states south korea said recent major 
floods have left it strapped for cash

the chairman of the governing socialist 
party a member of the politburo under the ousted communist leader 
todor zhivkov stepped down today under fire from reformers 
his announcement came on the third day of a turbulent congress 
to determine the future of the party that shed its communist 
appellation last spring and went on to win multiparty elections 
the resigning party leader alexander lilov had taken over in 
february as bulgaria was swept by the wave of reform that toppled 
hardline communist regimes across eastern europe 
lilov has disappointed many party members and other bulgarians 
who expected him to spearhead swift political change 
political tensions have been exacerbated by an unprecedented 
food shortage in the balkan nation and the socialists popularity 
is dwindling many store shelves are empty essential foodstuffs 
are rationed and electricity is periodically cut off 
in a speech today to the party congress lilov acknowledged he 
had been burdened by his ties to bulgarias past he said he was 
resigning in favor of a more pragmatic leader 
we are still not a new party which thinks analizes and acts 
from a new position lilov told delegates perhaps we are tired 
after holding power for over 45 years 
while warning against any drastic purge he called for a new and 
united party turning into a strong political organization with 
a rejuvenated leadership 
i have to assume the responsibility for the time during 
which i was a politburo member of this party this has been for 
more than ten years he said 
lilov and former president petar mladenov are among the top 
officials who held leading posts during zhivkovs lengthy rule 
but lilov for many years chief ideologist of the communist 
party was dropped from the leadership in 1983 he joined it again 
only after zhivkovs ouster in november 
lilovs resignation came a day after premier andrei lukanov 
named four possible candidates to replace him 
in heated debate at the congress heads of four reform factions 
called for a new younger leadership the vote could come late 
today or tuesday 
dragan draganov a leader of the radical change faction summed 
up the sentiment of the progressives in a briefing with reporters 
if no radical changes are made there will be a gradual 
disintegration of the party 
the other candidates for party leader named by the premier are 
alexander tomov petar emil mitev and asen zhablensky all are 
considered to be reformers 
lukanov the premier told the congress it should adopt decisive 
changes the supporters of the party expect a new face and it 
would be fatal if we did not accede to this demand he said 
lukanov who is also a member of the partys toplevel 
presidium is by far the most popular political leader in bulgaria 
the countrys chief of state is president zhelyu zhelev the 
former leader of the opposition union of democratic forces 
in his remarks to the party congress mitev a university 
professor and sociologist said a main reason for the situation 
in which the party finds itself now is a lack of political 
initiative after the elections 
in bulgarias free elections in june the former communists won 
an absolute majority of 211 of the 400 seats in parliament 
there will be no diesel no coal there wont even be 
enough bread in several months mitev warned

a huge mosaic of iridescent tiffany glass 
worth millions of dollars and considered by the late american 
artist to be his crowning achievement will be featured in a new 
church here 
lake merritt united methodist church is constructing its new 
building around the glittering mosaic valued in the millions of 
dollars but donated by another church 
the mosaic consists of three 8by17foot panels in the art 
nouveau style in which louis comfort tiffany crafted his renowned 
lamp shades and stainedglass windows entitled te deum 
laudamus the work depicts crowds adoring jesus christ shining 
above them on a throne 
before he died in 1933 tiffany was quoted as saying the panels 
he created 10 years earlier were his crowning achievement and 
critics have hailed the mosaic as his masterpiece 
its an important art addition to the bay area said don 
stover curator of the mh de young museum in san francisco 
stover who arranged an 1981 exhibit of tiffanys work said the 
mosaic was probably the only one by the artist in northern 
california 
i think its a real coup for oakland said the rev donald 
kuhn pastor of the lake merritt church his congregation was given 
the work by the first united methodist church in los angeles 
the three oneton panels were made for the los angeles church by 
tiffany studios of new york in 1923 at a cost of 130000 they 
dominated first uniteds choir loft until 1983 when shrinking 
membership forced the churchs board to sell the building 
the board kept the panels in storage until this year when it 
decided to give them to lake merritt selling them was never 
considered 
we preferred they go into another church its a way of 
preserving them and were hoping this way others will be blessed 
by them said grace keehler 88 a first united board member who 
belonged to the church when the panels were installed 
the mosaics worldly value is unknown but kuhn guesses it at 
millions of dollars 
a single tiffany lamp shade sold for for 550000 last year 
said patrick meehan an executive with christies fine art 
auctioneers in new york

bought some fruits and vegetables at the stores and the owners said 
business picked up over the weekend 
last week a detail of 400 officers was assigned to the stores

iraq today declared the kuwaiti currency 
the dinar invalid and withdrawn from circulation it said it would 
reimburse holders of the currency with iraqi dinars 
iraq will reimburse those who possess kuwaiti dinars with the 
iraqi currency on a oneforone basis the official iraqi news 
agency said 
the iraqi currency is not convertible on international markets 
the exchange of currency will be carried out until oct 6 after 
which the kuwaiti dinar will be considered illegal tender the 
iraqi agency quoted the governments economics committee as saying 
iraq has methodically dismantled kuwaiti institutions following 
its aug 2 seizure and subsequent annexation of the neighboring 
oilrich emirate 
baghdad authorities have officially disbanded kuwaits 
government military foreign embassies and national airline 
they refer to kuwait as iraqs 19th province but the united 
nations recognizes kuwaits deposed alsabah family as the 
countrys rulers 
the alsabahs have set up a governmentinexile in saudi arabia 
and still control billions of dollars in assets worldwide 
the iraqi dinars official value remains the same but its value 
for those who use it on the black market is about a tenth of the 
official rate iraq punishes currency smugglers with death 
the fall of kuwait made instant paupers out of tens of thousands 
of people with assets in kuwait or kuwaiti currency 
kuwaits dinar is no longer convertible outside iraq and kuwait 
except in certain very limited circumstances kuwaitis stranded in 
london for example can go to the national bank of kuwait or 
united bank of kuwait and receive pounds if they have dinar 
accounts there and can prove a desperate need 
before iraqi president saddam hussein ordered his army into 
kuwait one iraqi dinar was worth 322 at the official rate and 
one kuwaiti dinar traded at 345

a breakin at saudi arabias 
biggest oil company two weeks ago is believed to be part of an 
alleged effort by jordanian and yemeni diplomats to gather 
information about strategic saudi installations for iraq 
diplomatic sources said today 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
breakin was one of numerous suspicious activities that led the 
saudi government to demand saturday that iraq jordan and yemen 
recall most of their envoys to riyadh 
officials at the oil company saudi aramco confirmed that two 
weeks ago there was an incident in which a fence surrounding oil 
tanks was cut aramco officials refused to immediately provide any 
further details 
the diplomatic sources said the perpetrators were spotted by a 
security sentry after cutting through an outside fence and did not 
get through an additional inside barrier 
they were spotted and they ran away said one of the 
sources 
a diplomatic source said the incident coincided with a period in 
which yemeni and jordanian diplomats were monitored traveling in 
the eastern province area that is home to aramco and most of the 
troops deployed here to defend saudi arabia 
another source said several yemenis with diplomatic privileges 
were stopped in the area and questioned by local authorities 
several days after the fence was cut the source refused to discuss 
this aspect further 
the sources said they were reluctant to discuss the aramco 
incident because they did not want to raise fears among the 
companys expatriate workers most workers sent their families home 
after the iraqi invasion of kuwait several weeks ago 
one of the sources who provided a detailed briefing on the 
alleged suspicious activities of the jordanian and yemeni 
officials said saudi intelligence officials placed the diplomats 
under surveillance immediately after the aug 2 iraqi invasion 
the movements of the iraqi diplomats were immediately 
restricted so it was obvious they would need help if they wanted to 
egange in espionage this source said 
the jordanians and yemenis were observed taking long drives to 
areas in which they had no business including the eastern 
province the center of the kingdoms oil economy 
the source said saudi officials also monitored a series of 
meetings between the jordanian yemeni and iraqi diplomatic 
officials 
another diplomatic source said saudi military officials had told 
him that jordanian and yemeni diplomatic aides were monitored 
taking photographs of saudi military government and economic 
installations including oil refineries and military bases where 
american troops are based 
it appeared to the military to be reconnaissance the source 
said 
in announcing the expulsions late saturday the saudi ministry 
of foreign affairs said only that the jordanian iraqi and yemeni 
diplomats were being asked to leave the country because they 
engaged in activities jeopardizing the peace and security of the 
kingdom these activities do not conform with diplomatic rules and 
regulations 
the foreign ministry statements said the saudi government 
complained to the three governments about the blatant and 
flagrant infringements but that the suspicious activities 
continued 
the saudis then demanded that the governments sharply reduce the 
number of diplomats in saudi arabia diplomatic sources said 56 
yemenis 10 jordanians and 14 iraqis were covered by the expulsion 
order

determined to hike the 2100mile 
appalachian trail despite his blindness bill irwin has replaced 
his lust for wine and women with a devotion to god that guides his 
every deliberate step 
he has come almost 1800 miles since leaving georgia six months 
ago with his guide dog orient irwin has raversed mountaintops and 
braved blizzards craved cheeseburgers and greasy french fries 
broken a rib and fallen an estimated 3000 times 
his destination is mount katahdin maine more than 300 miles 
away if he gets there irwin will be the first blind man known to 
hike the entire appalachian trail 
in the mountains of new hampshire irwin talked about the days 
of wine women and song when he was an alcoholic womanizer and 
smoked five packs of cigarettes a day 
i was a jetsetter playboy the only woman i liked better 
than my wife was your wife he joked 
the bible replaced booze four years ago when he didnt think he 
could sink any lower he said 
alone and with a sixmile hike and a crash course on survival as 
training irwin began his quest 
we just set out to come to maine irwin said in his 
burlington nc drawl 
he wandered the georgia wilderness for four days not sure if he 
was lost 
starting out on springer mountain all alone in the middle of 
the worst flood in the history of georgia not even knowing how 
i was going to get down the trail was the scariest portion of 
the trip he said 
irwin wears pads to protect his knees from the 15 falls he said 
he takes daily 
but irwin said he has become proficient at staying on the trail 
and knows when orient has strayed 
i can tell by the way he turns his head that we are off the 
trail because when hes not certain he is sniffing the ground and 
walking with hesitancy he said 
irwin 50 headed for mount washington on sunday after a day of 
shopping in conway battered by treacherous hiking in new 
hampshire where the terrain is rougher irwins pace has slowed 
from 15 miles per day to about six 
though he cant see the magnificent vistas the trailside 
sunsets or other views that sighted people experience irwin said 
he finds solace in the silence beauty in the odors and sensations 
of nature and tries to construct images of the landscape when 
others are around he asks them to describe the scene 
i still rely on visual imagery more than anything else 
irwin said 
it wasnt always so for this broadshouldered lumbering man 
with scruffy blonde hair 
irwin had normal vision until the age of 28 when he was struck 
with chorio retinitis a disease that destroys the retina 
though he has been chased by the media and portrayed in several 
tabloid magazines one which had him clutching a sapling dangling 
above a gorge irwin said he never meant to put himself in the 
spotlight 
im no great example of anything he said any blind 
person that is capable could do the same thing if they wanted to go 
through the same difficulty 
the stories and faces will remain long after he finishes the 
trip and tries to parlay his experience into a business that 
combines hiking and counseling irwin said 
irwin said he wont forget the irish goat an untidy crusty 
hiker who woke everyone one night with his screams a mouse had 
perched on the old mans beard and was eating remnants from that 
evenings meal irwin said bursting into laughter 
in new york the mosquitoes were so bad one day that irwin tied 
a bandana over his face a woman startled at the sight of a man 
hiking with his face and eyes covered asked him if he was crazy 
irwin said 
just taking this seeingeye dog for a training run irwin

another college student set himself on 
fire today in the latest of a series of increasingly violent 
protests against a plan to give more government jobs to members of 
lower castes 
earlier today police used tear gas to disperse a mob near 
parliament house and the police headquarters in the capital was 
besieged for three hours by angry students 
the uppercaste students say reserving desirable government jobs 
for members of lower castes amounts to reverse discrimination the 
government says the downtrodden deserve more opportunities 
witnesses said the 22yearold student doused himself with 
gasoline in the capitals busiest intersection and then set himself 
ablaze he was badly burned and a doctor said he was unlikely to 
live through the night 
a report said two other people set themselves on fire in 
jaiphur 180 miles southwest of new delhi united news of india 
said both were being treated for thirddegree burns 
todays suicide attempt in the capital took place at an 
intersection on new delhis busy ring road since thursday it has 
been the site of a protest by hundreds of students 
the other demonstrators said they did not know of the students 
plans to set himself on fire 
we were sitting under the tent when we saw a ball of black 
smoke and caught the stench of burning flesh said kamal 
kishore sharma who rushed to the aid of the burned student 
identified as singh chauhan 
more than a dozen other students have set themselves on fire in 
protests and two suffered serious burns and are in critical 
condition during the weekend a 16yearold schoolboy killed 
himself by swallowing insecticide 
hundreds of thousands of students have turned out for 
demonstrations and at least 25 students have been killed in street 
battles with police since the new policy was announced aug 7 
no political party has supported the students position and the 
army has been sent in to maintain law and order in four cities 
schools and colleges have been closed in many towns 
the policy reserves 27 percent of government jobs for people 
from low castes who suffered for centuries under indias strict 
social hierarchy another 225 percent were previously kept aside 
for the most backward castes and native tribes 
singh set a further quota of 5 to 10 percent of jobs for poor 
people irrespective of caste leaving about 40 percent of the 18 
million whitecollar government jobs available on merit alone 
hindus who make up 82 percent of the popluation are divided 
into four castes and hundreds of subcastes discrimination on the 
basis of caste is illegal but in practice the system permeates 
much of indian life especially in the rural areas

the international monetary fund gave approval 
today to an accelerated effort to supply billions of dollars to 
help countries hurt by the persian gulf crisis 
the approval by the imfs policymaking interim committee 
represented a victory for the bush administration which is 
counting on both the imf and its sister lending agency the world 
bank to help in the international effort to isolate iraqi 
president saddam hussein 
in a final communique the imf interim committee directed the 
staff of the international lending agency to respond on an 
expedited basis to present difficulties 
the communique provided no specifics on how much money would be 
forthcoming but us officials have discussed that three countries 
alone egypt jordan and turkey would need between 13 billion 
and 16 billion in economic assistance through the end of next 
year 
canadian finance minister michael wilson said the lack of 
specifics did not indicate dissension on the part of the 22 finance 
ministers on the interim committee but rather a desire to leave as 
much flexibility as possible for the imf to channel aid to 
countries 
we recognized the urgency of the needs of the people who are 
affected wilson said the urgency is stated the framework is

a 1987 naval academy graduate who says he 
was forced to quit the navy because of his homosexuality is 
refusing demands that he pay for his education 
the navy wants orlando gotay to pay 22949 in tuition because 
he resigned from the military before completing the five years of 
service academy graduates must perform 
gotay who now lives in san francisco said he wont pay because 
officers pressured him to get out early 
the american civil liberties union has agreed to represent gotay 
in court if the pentagon pushes the matter 
first they force me out end my career as a naval officer and 
then they tell me i have to pay them for doing this to me gotay 
told the annapolis capital 
a navy spokeswoman said each midshipman signs a contract 
promising to repay tuition if they voluntarily resign before 
finishing the 5year service obligation 
lt beci brenton said the navy has sent gotay three letters 
asking him to begin payments because he has not replied the 
account has been turned over to the us justice department for 
collection 
in may the navy decided to let two gay rotc cadets keep 
scholarships after they were discharged from the training corps 
because of their sexuality 
gotay and his lawyers said they knew of no precedent at the 
naval academy the navy said gotays case is not the first of its 
kind 
gotay 26 was serving as a machinery officer aboard the uss 
belknap flagship of the 6th fleet when he learned in june 1989 
that he was under investigation for homosexuality 
the inquiry did not prove any sexual misconduct although gotay 
admits now that he is gay the us armed forces prohibit 
homosexuals from military service 
a month later gotay said he was charged with fraternization 
or social contact with enlisted personnel his commanding officer 
dismissed the charge however and issued him a mild reprimand 
but gotay said word spread about his sexual preference making 
life aboard the guided missile cruiser a nightmare 
what i went through the mental abuse and the psychological 
strain was far worse than even plebe summer gotay said 
referring to the strenuous training that academy inductees receive 
their first summer in annapolis 
in november gotay got a letter from the chief of naval 
operations informing him that administrative hearings on alleged 
misconduct were being prepared against him and that he could 
either stand trial or resign he resigned 
last march gotay was given an honorable discharge 
because of this voluntary resignation the navy ordered gotay 
about a week after his discharge to pay the tuition 
gotay said he was not aware of his own homosexuality until his 
final year at annapolis he was aware of the military policy toward 
homosexuals and kept his preferences to himself he said

overturned the acquittal of a jewish settlement leader and 
convicted him of assaulting an arab family the justice ministry 
said today 
the ministry said the threejudge district court found rabbi 
moshe levinger guilty of assault trespass and insulting a soldier 
in the occupied west bank town of hebron in 1988 
jerusalem magistrate yoel tsur acquitted levinger and the state 
prosecution appealed

samooch family house in hebron after his daughter claimed one of 
their children had insulted her 
levinger was charged with assaulting mrs samooch and attempting 
to assault their 7yearold daughter he also disobeyed a soldiers 
orders to leave the house shouting at him you contaminate

instances in which the court of appeals intervened in factual 
evidence and in determining the credibility of witnesses

president bush today urged district of 
columbia voters to support former police chief maurice turner for 
mayor saying turner is dead set at getting the deadwood out of 
city government 
it is time for a change bush said at at 250perplate 
breakfast fundraiser for turner the republican mayoral candidate 
it is time to put chief turner in charge of the entire city 
the president also praised turner for his 32year police career 
and service to the nations capital 
hes got a strong message for the criminals who create a 
climate of fear and the drug dealers who prey on our children 
you can run but you cant hide bush said help maurice 
turner turn this city around no one is more dead set at getting 
the deadwood out of city government 
turner thanked bush for his support and predicted that he will 
defeat the heavilyfavored democratic nominee sharon pratt dixon 
the two are vying for the seat held by marion barry who was 
recently convicted on one misdemeanor count of possession of 
cocaine and did not seek reelection 
i did not enter this race merely to make a good showing 
turner said on nov 6 i will be the next mayor 
republicans in the nations capital believe that turners 
popularity provides their best chance ever to win the mayors chair 
in this heavily democratic city 
many republican party officials believe that turner who is 
black can help the gop attract minorities when turner a lifelong 
democrat switched parties last year the event was publicized in 
an oval office photo opportunity with bush 
and when turner announced he would run for mayor he did so with 
pledges of fundraising and strategy help from the gop 
but turner differs with the president on local and national 
issues bush is against statehood for the nations capital while 
turner advocates it the former law enforcement official also 
favors abortion rights 
turner faces an uphill battle to defeat dixon the upset winner 
in the democratic mayoral primary 
dixon who has never held elective office defeated several 
veteran city council members sept 11 by pledging to clean up local 
government following barrys drug and perjury trial 
she has concentrated on portraying turner as a member of barrys 
administration and has sought to blame him for the heavy increase 
in drugrelated crime that occurred while he was police chief 
but the crucial factor in the race may be voter registration 
democrats outnumber republicans by a 91 margin in the district

equal numbers of police and demonstrators 
gathered outside a courthouse today at the opening of the obscenity 
trial of an art gallery and its director for showing robert 
mapplethorpes photographs 
jury selection was scheduled to get under way this morning in 
the trial of the contemporary arts center and dennis barrie 
the case has become a rallying point for artists first 
amendment activists and those who believe the indictments are part 
of a wider effort to intimidate homosexuals 
we think the prosecution is motivated by homophobia said 
scott maclarty spokesman for the gaylesbian march activists we 
think it is motivated by hatred for artists 
maclarty was among 50 people who gathered outside the hamilton 
county courthouse to demonstrate against prosecution of the 
gallery about the same number of police patrolled on foot on 
horseback and on motorcycles 
in cincinnati artists risk criminal prosecution if they 
succeed here they will spread their inquisition elsewhere 
maclarty said earlier 
but monty lobb jr president of citizens concerned for 
community values an antiobscenity activist group in cincinnati 
said the mapplethorpe prosecution is necessary in order to 
safeguard the communitys moral standards 
people should understand cincinnati the material thats been 
indicted and is before the court now theres nothing like that 
available in cincinnati you dont have it in videotapes you dont 
have it in magazines books nothing here in cincinnati lobb 
said in an earlier interview to say nothing about it would be a 
form of acceptance we dont want that the people dont want 
that 
the sevenweek exhibition of photos by mapplethorpe who died of 
aids in 1989 drew a record crowd of more than 80000 to the 
gallery last spring 
but a grand jury indicted barrie and the gallery concluding 
that seven of the 175 photos violated community standards one 
photo shows a man urinating into another mans mouth others show 
oral sex and anal penetration with objects 
barrie 43 and the gallery are charged with pandering obscenity 
and with using children in nudityrelated material the second 
charge stems from two photos one of a boy and one of a girl their 
genitals exposed 
if convicted barrie could get up to six months in jail and a 
1000 fine on each count the gallery could be fined 5000 on 
each count 
municipal judge david albanese earlier ruled each photo can be 
considered separately he rejected defense arguments that the 
entire exhibit be considered as a whole including mapplethorpes 
portraits and floral studies 
defense lawyers have argued that the gallery is a museum and is 
thus protected from obscenity laws but albanese said the 
contemporary arts center does not fit the definition of a museum 
since it has no permanent collection 
the exhibit was canceled at the corcoran art gallery in 
washington last year because of a furor over government funding of 
art deemed obscene 
the national endowment for the arts has since adopted a policy 
requiring grant applicants to certify their awards will not be used 
for work that might be deemed obscene sen jesse helms rnc 
had pressed for the policy 
the mapplethorpe exhibit has appeared in several us cities 
without incident it is on display now at the institute for 
contemporary art in boston 
barrie who has been director of the contemporary arts center 
since 1983 and holds a doctorate in american cultural art from 
wayne state university has said the indictments reflect the 
thinking of a small group of conservatives 
i think these are all attempts to limit the first amendment 
it scares some of these groups who want only one point of view 
their point of view he said

warning that israel would respond appropriately to an iraqi 
attack 
the statement read to reporters by spokesman moshe raviv

respond to his invasion of kuwait 
likewise he may underestimate the capacity and resolve of 
israel raviv said israel has proved in the past that it knows 
how to defend itself and if attacked it will not hesitate to 
respond appropriately 
the foreign minister said israel would give iraq no pretext for 
an attack but said the multinational buildup in the persian gulf 
is liable to accelerate the carrying out of the threat against 
israel and we need to take this into account 
meanwhile the israeli newspaper yediot ahronots military 
correspondent citing an assessment by senior israeli officials 
said war in the region is inevitable and everything is now a

a group of 15 japanese politicians arrived in north 
korea today on a visit japan hopes will help thaw icy relations 
between the two asian neighbors 
in a sign of a positive reception from north korea its official 
korean central news agency reported the groups arrival without the 
usual virulent references to japan 
the delegation of legislators from japans governing liberal 
democratic and socialist parties was met at pyongyangs airport by 
kim yong sun secretary of the central committee of the workers 
party of korea the communist nations ruling party kcna said in a 
report monitored in tokyo 
the delegation is led by shin kanemaru one of the japanese 
governing partys most influential leaders 
kanemaru was expected to seek the release of japanese seamen 
being held in north korea as a first step toward closer ties 
between the two countries which have no formal diplomatic 
relations 
kanemaru also was expected to carry an apology from prime 
minister toshiki kaifu to the north korean people for japans 
191045 occupation of korea 
chief cabinet secretary misoji sakamoto said the missions aim 
was to pave the way for the release of two seamen and to help 
open dialogue between the two countries 
the japanese seamen have been held in north korea on espionage 
charges since november 1983 pyongyang has pressed for the return 
of a north korean defector in exchange for their release but japan 
has refused the demand 
north korea is one of the few countries with which japan has no 
diplomatic relations although only 350 miles of sea separate the 
two nations pyongyang has long maintained that south korea japan 
and us imperialists are planning an invasion 
the japan socialist party along with the japannorth korea 
parliamentarian goodwill league has acted as a bridge between the 
two countries 
the mission flew directly to pyongyang aboard a japan airlines 
chartered jet rather than taking the usual route through beijing 
japan ruled korea as a colony from 1910 to the end o world war 
ii in 1945 when the korean peninsula was divided into the 
communist north and capitalist south

president saddam husseins obsession with secrecy 
has undermined the military strength of iraq but his tank and 
artillery forces remain formidable military analysts said in a 
report today 
during the eightyear war against iran saddam and his high 
command rarely passed information to divisional commanders said 
the analysis in a special issue of janes soviet intelligence 
review 
it said this secrecy made allout attacks a virtual 
impossibility given saddams autocratic tightening of control 
since then the report said the situation is likely to have 
worsened 
it added that although much of iraqs military equipment is 
obsolete by western and soviet standards the more modern weapons 
were capable of inflicting damage on the multinational forces 
that have gathered in the gulf region since iraq seized kuwait aug 
2 
iraq has about 5000 battle tanks including about 200 
britishmade chieftain and vickers tanks seized in kuwait said the 
report 
on air power the report cited iraqs soviet badger strike 
aircraft with a combat range of nearly 2000 miles as among its 
most potent weapons but the report said the iraq air force had 
been used relatively little during the iraniraq war and its 
capabilities remained uncertain

israel will demolish houses and shops to punish 
the palestinian refugee camp in the occupied gaza strip where an 
israeli soldier was stoned to death and then burned in his car 
military officers and arab reports said today 
israel also is considering the deportation of palestinians 
suspected of involvement in the killing 
the soldier sgt amnon pomeranz 46 was stoned to death on 
thursday in gazas el bureij refugee camp after his car hit a 
donkey cart injuring two palestinian teenagers the palestinian 
mob then set his car on fire with him inside 
arab reports said the army ordered at least 20 families in the 
camp to remove their belongings from their homes such orders 
usually precede the demolition of houses 
they also said the owners of 13 shops and one gas station were 
ordered to vacate their premises apparently in advance of 
demolition 
the gas station apparently was the one from which palestinians 
obtained gassoaked rags that they threw on the soldiers car to 
set it on fire 
hasham mahamid a member of the israeli parliament said after a 
onehour visit to the camp that he saw the owner of the gas station 
and at least a dozen shopkeepers removing goods from their shops 
people told me there might be 37 houses and shops demolished 
and that they expected it to be soon mahamid said 
pomeranz was the 48th israeli to die in the 34month palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
israeli soldiers and civilians have killed 730 palestinians and 
264 palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs most on 
suspicion of collaboration with israel 
the el bureij camp home to 20000 palestinians was under 
curfew today for the fifth day while soldiers combed the area for 
suspects associated press reporters were turned away from the camp 
by soldiers because of the curfew 
defense minister moshe arens was quoted in the hebrew daily 
hadashot today as demanding the deportation of those involved in 
the murder if there is not enough evidence to bring the suspects 
to trial 
the newspaper said arens ordered the armys legal officers to 
check out ways to speed up the deportation process which can take 
months because of appeal procedures 
defense ministry spokesman dan naveh declined comment on the 
report saying he could not discuss specific actions that are 
going to be taken 
israel has deported 61 arabs for instigating and perpetrating 
antiisraeli violence since the uprising began in december 1987 
the last deportation was in august 1989

thirteen people arrested during a 
protest of a study of marine mining potential off the oregon coast 
were released from jail early today 
the coast guard made the arrests sunday after an activist from 
the environmental group greenpeace chained herself to a crane on 
the research vessel aloha about a mile off the mouth of the rogue 
river at gold beach 
a spokesman at the curry county jail said the 13 were released 
before dawn seven of those arrested were greenpeace activists 
sundays protest was led by the 181foot greenpeace flagship 
rainbow warrior and included about two dozen local fishing boats 
local fishermen and greenpeace oppose the research saying 
mining the sea floor would destroy fisheries 
the aloha began a twoweek governmentsponsored cruise last 
week 
the rainbow warrior remained anchored off gold beach this 
morning said crew member rien achterman he said the vessels 
plans for today had not been announced 
greenpeace spokeswoman cynthia rust said she expected protests 
to continue even after the rainbow warrior leaves 
the local fishermen are part of this protest she said i 
doubt very seriously their opposition to offshore mining will stop 
just because the greenpeace boat leaves 
two greenpeace activists boarded the 143foot aloha about noon 
sunday 
one diana desnoyers 30 climbed an aframe crane at the stern 
of the aloha and chained herself 15 feet above the deck coast 
guardsmen cut her loose and arrested her about an hour later 
the coast guard seized three greenpeace inflatable boats and the 
32foot top gun a sea urchin diving vessel based in port orford 
the arrests and boat seizures came because the vessels violated 
a 500yard federallyordered safety zone around the aloha coast 
guard lt doug stephan said 
stephan said five coast guard vessels and a helicopter remained 
in the area 
its apparent to us now that were going to have to enforce 
that safety zone as long as the aloha is there he said

president bush welcomed south african 
president fw de klerk to the white house today in a show of 
political support for his efforts to guide south africa toward a 
postapartheid democratic system 
its marvelous being here the south african leader said at 
the outset of oneonone talks with bush in the oval office 
both presidents sitting in wingback chairs by the fireplace 
declined to answer questions from reporters allowed to witness the 
opening moments after a brief explanation from bush on his 
practice of refusing to answer questions at photo opportunities de 
klerk said i think i shall abide by the oval office rules 
im going to do this the presidents way said de klerk 
smiling broadly 
it was the firstever meeting between the two leaders after 
their private session they were meeting with top aides then 
repairing to the white houses residential quarters for a working 
luncheon 
bush was intent on paying tribute to de klerk for the leadership 
he has provided in beginning to dismantle white supremacist rule in 
south africa their discussion was partly aimed at devising ways 
the united states can help speed the process 
no south african head of state has visited washington since 
1945 as recently as the reagan administration the two countries 
were barely on speaking terms because of the sanctions congress 
imposed on south africa in 1986 
but the us attitude toward south africa changed dramatically 
with the liberalizing steps de klerk has taken including freeing 
african national congress leader nelson mandela from prison and 
lifting bans on democratic political groups 
still de klerks visit is less triumphal than many had hoped 
because of the recent upsurge in violence in south african black 
townships the death toll is estimated at about 750 
the violence may have contributed to the congressional black 
caucus decision to cancel a scheduled meeting with de klerk the 
announcement on saturday gave no specific reason for the 
cancellation 
mandela has sought to hold proapartheid security elements of 
the police and military responsible for the violence a possibility 
that south african officials do not dismiss mandela has said that 
americans should demand from de klerk an explanation for the 
increasing violence 
the lawyers committee for civil rights under law a 
washingtonbased private group has challenged de klerk to ensure 
that police and military assassination squads are fully exposed 
and completely disbanded 
de klerk said on his arrival sunday he was bringing a message of 
hope for the future of his country and for all of southern africa 
we are proceeding irreversibly on the road to a new south 
africa where justice the guarantees of constitutional democracy 
and the rule of law will bring lasting peace and prosperity to all 
our people said de klerk he is staying in washington until 
tuesday night 
an administration official who briefed reporters said de klerks 
visit is not designed to bring about an end to us sanctions 
south africa has fulfilled some but not all of the conditions 
required by law for the sanctions to be lifted 
de klerk said saturday the sanctions will not be a major focus 
of his visit 
im not going hat in hand with the particular objective of 
getting sanctions lifted he said

the soviet union has made available copies of 
documents captured at the end of world war ii that contain the 
names of 400000 people who died or were interned in nazi 
concentration and forced labor camps 
the american red cross said today it has opened a holocaust and 
war victims tracing and information center in baltimore to help 
people learn the fate of friends or relatives 
the announcement said the international red cross had received 
from the soviets copies of archival material recovered by the 
soviet army during the liberation of the camps at the end of the 
war 
the material includes 46 books containing nearly 70000 death 
certificates from the auschwitz concentration camps also included 
are the names of 130000 prisoners used for forced labor in various 
german firms and 200000 names of victims in other camps 
including dachau sachsenhausen gross rosen and buchenwald 
the documents are being housed at the international tracing 
service an agency of the international committee of the red cross 
in arolsen west germany there were already 13 million names on 
file at arolsen 
the red cross said the baltimore center can help people obtain 
certification of incarceration forced labor or death of family 
members it also can help survivors who were interned receive 
compensation and may in some cases result in reunification of 
family members the organization said 
we hope that this tracing service will bring some closure to 
the pain felt by so many people who dont know what happened to 
members of their family said stephen h richards executive vice 
president of the american red cross 
people wishing to learn the fate of family members were urged to 
contact their local chapters of the american red cross local 
caseworkers will send the information to the center in baltimore 
where it will be translated into german and forwarded to arolsen 
we want people to be aware of the availability of this 
important new information said richards he cautioned however 
that the tracing process is slow because of the crossreferencing 
needed because of various spellings of names and because of 
possible inaccuracies in the records he said people who ask for 
help will get interim reports as the work proceeds 
the service is a collaborative effort of the central maryland 
chapter and american red cross international services working with 
the international committee of the red cross other national red 
cross and red crescent societies and magen david adom the israeli 
counterpart of the american red cross the organization said 
those wishing more information were urged to contact their local 
red cross chapters or call the red cross tollfree hotline at

sen alan cranston said today he will vote 
against the nomination of supreme court nominee david souter he 
was the first senator to go on record against the new hampshire 
jurist whose confirmation is widely seen as assured 
cranston complained that souter in three days of testimony to 
the senate judiciary committee refused to back abortion rights 
i will vote no because judge souter will not reveal his 
views on a fundamental constitutional issue the right of 
privacy cranston of california the assistant democratic 
leader said in a floor speech 
after cranston stated his opposition in a floor speech sen 
howell heflin dala stood up to announce his endorsement he 
said he believed the 51yearold new hampshire jurist possesses the 
endearing quality of being willing to listen to be fair and 
impartial 
the statements came as the senate judiciary committee prepared 
to vote on president bushs selection to replace retired associate 
justice william brennan on the nations highest court that vote 
could come as early as thursday 
a vote by the full senate is likely soon after that perhaps in 
time for souter to take his seat when the supreme court returns to 
the bench oct 1 
cranston had stated his intention in an interview sunday 
i cannot support a nominee who refuses to acknowledge that a 
womans right to choose to terminate a pregnancy is a fundamental 
right or that the right of individuals married or unmarried to 
use contraceptives to prevent a pregnancy is a matter of settled 
law cranston said 
i cannot support a nominee who regards these issues as open 
questions he said 
my view of my responsibility under the constitution to the 
generations of americans who will be affected by those decisions 
particularly the millions of young women whose very lives may well 
depend on the right to choose whether or not to carry a pregancy 
compels me to vote no on this nomination cranston said 
souter said during his confirmation hearings that he has not 
made up his mind on how he would vote if he as a justice was 
asked to overturns the 1973 decision in roe vs wade that legalized 
abortion 
heflin is one of three senators who usually hold the balance of 
power between the liberal and conservative wings of the judiciary 
committee in 1987 he opposed president reagans nomination of 
robert h bork to the supreme court 
while some groups have opposed souter because he refused to 
discuss his views on abortion heflin said today he thinks it wrong 
to demand that nominees express their precise opinions on such 
issues before confirmation 
after listening to souters testimony before the judiciary 
committee heflin said he is satisfied souter understands the 
importance of judicial restraint and prior court interpretations of 
the bill of rights and the due process and equal protection clauses 
of key constitutional amendments 
judge souter will not bring a scorchedearth philosophy to the 
court but he will bring a sense of historic perspective and a 
clearheaded approach to the analysis of legal issues said 
heflin a former alabama chief justice

sequoia celebrates its 
centennial tuesday as the secondoldest national park with its 
superintendent hoping the home of the worlds biggest trees will be 
even better 100 years from now 
a 13255foot mountain one of thousands in the sierra nevada 
range that forms californias spine will be named centennial peak 
during a brief ceremony honoring both sequoia and its slightly 
younger cousin kings canyon national park 
however most of the celebration was on sunday when people were 
invited to visit the adjacent parks free and learn about their 
history and future sequoia 150 miles northeast of los angeles 
became a national park six days before kings canyon and their more 
celebrated neighbor 80 miles north yosemite 
president benjamin harrison signed legislation on sept 25 
1890 making sequoia the second national park yellowstone was 
established in 1872 
at first only 500 people a year visited the california parks 
because they were so remote in the days before cars now more than 
16 million people a year visit sequoia and kings canyon 
that has caused park officials to start reducing human impact by 
moving public facilities out of sequoias giant forest area a 
process that will take at least until the beginning of the 21st 
century 
we want to avoid designing facilities that lure people to one 
spot and cause a crowd superintendent j thomas ritter said as 
he stood near the general sherman tree the largest living thing in 
the world at 272 feet tall and containing 63664 cubic feet of 
lumber 
the goal he said is to disperse people to points of interest 
and programs spread throughout the park if we are successful 
today and the next 100 years we will have overcome our biggest 
potential problem he said 
ritter noted that the task of dispersing people is easier over 
the large area of sequoiakings canyon than at yosemite where 
almost all the 3 million visitors a year want to visit narrow 
yosemite valley 
visitors to kings canyon can travel to grant grove and look at 
the general grant tree officially the nations christmas tree or 
camp and hike along the john muir trail to high country lakes 
formed by melting snow 
others can head south through the tall pines and firs of sequoia 
to the even taller and broader trees many of them growing since 
before jesus was born 
people can take a healthy hike a few hundred feet up to moro 
rock and look over the western divide or a much longer harder hike 
up mount whitney at 14495 feet above sea level the tallest 
mountain in the contiguous 48 states 
the people clearly have to come on the natural terms of the 
park ritter said but the geography is in our favor

peninsula the industrial plants annually emit more than 670000 
tons of sulfur dioxide a chief cause of acid rain and are 
polluting northern europe

economic zone monday and returned to the norwegian arctic port of 
kirkenes the group said in a statement

novaya zemlya a primary soviet nuclear test site from 1958 to

provide funding and technology for 50 percent of the 750 million 
program due to be completed in 1994

french president francois mitterrand today 
condemned baghdad for its invasion of kuwait calling iraq a 
warlike state and stressing that the sovereignty of kuwait is not 
negotiable 
how could we not be disgusted by the taking of thousands of 
hostages he asked the general assembly 
iraqs ambassador to the united nations listened silently but 
highlevel iraqi officials including foreign minister tariq aziz 
were absent iraq said today it had rejected a us offer to allow 
an iraqi plane to fly the iraqi delegation to new york if about 
1000 americans held in occupied kuwait and iraq were allowed to 
leave 
in order to prevent this anarchy and theory of might makes 
right and avoid a situation in which one powerful person might be 
replaced by another i cant find any other answer than the rule of 
law of right mitterrand said 
speaking of kuwait he said the sovereignty of that country 
is not negotiable 
he also pointed out the danger to other persian gulf nations 
these neighboring peoples who if things get out of control will 
depend on the expansionist determination of one man on one warlike 
state 
the french president expressed outrage over iraqs raids on 
european diplomatic compounds in kuwait on sept 14 when diplomats 
were detained temporarily and three frenchmen seized 
iraq made a belated apology sunday saying its soldiers had made 
a mistake after the raids france immediately called for an 
emergency meeting of the 15member un security council which 
unanimously denounced iraq 
but mitterrand said that was unacceptable and noted that iraqi 
president saddam hussein has not yet made any gesture or move to 
defuse the crisis 
brazil provided the first speaker at todays session president 
fernando collor de mello 
the crisis that has befallen kuwait presents an unexpected and 
serious threat to collective peace he said 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze speaks tuesday both 
president bush and aziz of iraq are scheduled to address the 
160member assembly on oct 1 
aziz said sunday however that his government would not 
participate because the united states had prevented him from flying 
to new york in an iraqi airways plane 
iraq said today it rejected a us offer to allow an iraqi plane 
to fly aziz to new york if about 1000 americans could leave kuwait 
and iraq 
the official iraqi news agency said the offer was made after 
aziz complained to un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
that washington refused to allow his plane to come to new york 
perez de cuellar said sunday that he planned talks with aziz in 
the near future on iraqs position that it will never give up 
kuwait which saddams forces seized on aug 2 
the french president had been expected to express outrage over 
iraqs raids on european diplomatic compounds after the raids 
france immediately called for an emergency meeting of the 15member 
un security council which unanimously denounced iraq 
that resolution also warned iraq that the security council would 
adopt other measures to punish baghdad 
the measures are expected to be passed at an extraordinary 
council meeting on tuesday and include a proposal to impose an air 
embargo on iraq the first ever by the world body against a member 
under the sanctions flights from iraq and occupied kuwait would 
be limited to those carrying refugees flights bound for iraqiheld 
land would be inspected and allowed only to carry shipments of food 
or medicine approved by the security councils sanctions committee 
other countries would be required to deny iraqbound flights 
permission to refuel land or fly over their territory force 
would not be allowed but planes could be ordered to land 
in addition nations breaking the air embargo would be subject 
to secondary sanctions 
i think this will be a genuine turning point in human 
history said brian urquhart the former un 
undersecretarygeneral in charge of peacekeeping who retired in 
1986 this will be the test of whether collective security is a 
valid response to aggression 
unlike the security council the general assembly has no 
enforcement powers however the assembly speeches and resolutions 
are a powerful expression of the will of the world community

editors this is one in a series of stories about the 
unification of germany 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
what is now east germany will spin aimlessly 
in limbo for weeks after germany unites then slowly emerge from 
the remains of the old nation as five distinct lands 
but experts say it could take years of drastic reform to forge 
truly effective functioning states from the political and 
bureaucratic rubble of the former communist regime 
perhaps more important than the oct 3 date of german 
unification is what happens after oct 14 when east germans elect 
the first governments of the new states their nation will become 
until those governments take office and begin operating eastern 
germany essentially will be a territory a frontier with only 
inexperienced local governments chosen last may and a federal 
government far away in the western city of bonn 
because of the speed of unity much of east germany will be 
wiped out politically and legally before the states are operating 
at an adequate level experts say 
as far as the regional legislative and executive powers are 
concerned east germans will live in a lawless period for perhaps 
a quarter of a year said klaus kuehne a top official for the 
east german ministry for regional and community relations 
there will be only two or three temporary officials in the 
interim assigned to each state until their governments and state 
administrations materialize 
before these states are even functional in the slightest way 
1991 will have passed kuehne said this doesnt even take into 
account the quality of government when they are in place there is 
a dearth of qualified people 
these states cut from remnants of german principalities and 
prussian provinces will be in charge of the same things the 11 
states in west germany oversee schools law enforcement some 
social services and transportation 
they will face the monumental task of creating those entities 
from the centralized communist framework that once controlled all 
aspects of east german society from apartment rents to school 
curriculums 
the first step toward decentralizing will happen oct 3 when 
more than 200000 federal bureaucrats in east berlin alone will be 
out of work from ministers to office clerks 
the states however are still in the early throes of the local 
campaigns for the oct 14 elections scores of candidates are 
competing for the governorships and state legislatures 
the elections could be the last hurrah for the reformed 
communists who are given little chance of winning seats when a 
united german parliament is chosen dec 2 but may have a chance at 
regional seats on oct 14 
the newly coalescing states also are beginning to fight over 
boundaries to claim cities near the tentative borders and to 
debate which city should be the state capital 
heinrich vogel a political analyst and east german specialist 
with the cologne west germanybased german institute for eastern 
research and international studies said what is happening in the 
emerging states is political evolution at its most primeval 
there are all kinds of grabbing instincts that are part of the 
political game he said 
in what is now east germany the sparsely populated farmland of 
the north will be mecklenburglower pomerania where the cities of 
schwerin and rostock are competing to be the state capital 
the easterncentral section of the country will be brandenburg 
a former prussian province that will surround berlin the capital 
of a united germany that will have a separate status 
the centralwestern section is saxonyanhalt where the 
industrial cities of magdeburg halle and dessau are vying to be 
the capital 
the southwest corner is thuringia and the region in the 
southeast bordering czechoslovakia is saxony 
the five were german provinces given to the soviets after world 
war ii the soviet union created the german democratic republic 
east germany in 1949 and declared the provinces dissolved in 
1952 
the communists created a system of districts where power 
emanated from the capital east berlin they also created a 
national police force that will have to be broken up into state 
agencies 
west german states are supplying considerable manpower and 
expertise to help create a federal system in the east said manfred 
preiss minister for regional and community relations 
because they have a virtual monopoly on administrative 
experience many of the 2 million public employees in east 
germanys 88 million workforce may move to administrations of the 
states vogel said 
but vogel said the ingrained attitudes of communist bureaucracy 
will require substantial west german help 
its going to take quite awhile he said what we need is 
a real transfer of knowhow of federalist behavior 
education is another great concern vogel said it could take 
years to alter the old educational system in which teachers were 
the bulwark of communist ideology most teachers remain on board 
along with many headmasters 
the legal system will basically be scrapped since it is 
radically different from the west german system there is 
essentially no civil court system 
the legal apparatus is almost nonexistent vogel said 
those who have been judges theyre gone forget about the 
attorneys this is a sector that will primarily have to be filled 
up by the west

oil prices soared past 38 per barrel this 
morning and gasoline and home heating oil both topped 1 a gallon 
amid fear that war is imminent in the persian gulf 
i cant believe it said annlouise hittle a senior oil 
analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc people in the market 
are talking about 40 a barrel as being the next target 
light sweet crude was trading late this morning on the futures 
marketat 3880 per barrel for november contracts up 337 a 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange oil sold above the 37 
mark for the first time since the crude futures began trading on 
the exchange in 1983 and within hours it had shot above 38 per 
barrel 
at one point today oil reached as high as 3890 a barrel 
at the pump the average price of a gallon of gasoline has hit 
an alltime high of more than 138 an industry analyst said 
the price has gone up from around 118 in late july shortly 
before iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 and jumped 291 cents 
in the two weeks since the previous survey said the nationwide 
lundberg survey of 18500 gas stations 
iraqs leaders warned over the weekend that they would launch an 
allout war before allowing the un trade embargo to strangle 
their nation the statement was viewed as the first time that iraqi 
president saddam hussein had threatened a first strike with israel 
and mideast oil fields mentioned as potential targets 
recent estimates have put the price of oil at 60 per barrel if 
a shooting war develops in the gulf 
crudes surge this morning helped pull up the prices of refined 
products 
home heating oil shot up 979 cents to 107 per gallon for 
october delivery unleaded gasoline rose 870 cents to 106 per 
gallon for october contracts 
fears of supply shortages have helped keep the products high 
natural gas also rose sharply today with november contracts 
going up 73 cents to 1945 per 1000 cubic feet 
hittle said todays rise in oil prices was partly attributable 
to the effects of the boycott of iraqi and kuwaiti crude the 
international embargo of their crude was put in place shortly after 
iraq invaded kuwait on aug 2 but the effects were not immediately 
felt because it took ships that were already loaded several weeks 
to arrive 
basically the whole world now has gotten the last of the 
iraqi and kuwaiti crude hittle said first the far east was 
affected and then europe and now the us is feeling it 
oils previous high price on the mercantile exchange was 3560 
per barrel which came on friday to cap a string of records set 
last week 
the cash price of oil has traded at 40 amid the early 1980s oil 
crisis that followed the iranian invasion but oil futures were not 
traded on the exchange at that time

its a heavenly marketing idea 
two nuns from miami shores fla seeing what pictures on 
tshirts posters and the like have done to raise the profile of 
bart simpson decided to do the same with the virgin mary st 
francis of assisi and other heavenly heroes 
sister kathy hollywood said she and sister lorraine hale of the 
sisters of the presentation of the blessed virgin mary got the idea 
while working on doctorates on catholic schools 
during visits to catholic schools we asked the kids who the 
teachers told them to be like she recalled they said jesus 
and the saints but the kids wanted to be like madonna 
the nuns responded with shirts containing colorful decals of 
popular saints as a way to revitalize catholic tradition in a 
contemporary way said sister kathy she sold some of the shirts 
at the catholic education conference here friday 
the nuns also are working on saints greeting cards and have 
developed games quizzes and puzzles for kids 
they wouldnt be unhappy if their merchandise gives animated 
antihero bart simpson a run for his money 
we want to portray catholic values sister kathy said i 
dont think bart is helping us we hope in some way to balance out

the savings and loan crisis which has taken 
its biggest toll in texas isnt getting much mileage on the 
campaign trail there 
the issue doesnt have much political pop in texas said 
richard murray a university of houston political scientist and 
pollster 
its been such a massive problem here banks going under right 
and left people are almost immune to the thing said james dyer 
coordinator of the texas poll at texas aampms public policy research 
laboratory 
no one mentioned the crisis as an issue during a texas poll of 
state races this summer he said 
the average person especially in south texas does not have 
money invested in savings and loans or stocks and bonds said 
juan hinojosa a political scientist at the university of texaspan 
american theyre barely staying alive and trying to survive 
they dont see it as touching them 
the states gubernatorial candidates democrat ann richards and 
republican clayton williams both have made campaign pitches trying 
to link one another to the sampl crisis 
and hugh parmer the democratic challenger to gop sen phil 
gramm is complaining that gramm has incomplete campaign records 
and may have accepted more thriftrelated donations than he 
reported 
but such direct attacks appear to mean little to texans 
texans less frequently than other americans specifically point 
blame at president bush president reagan key congressional 
figures or financial managers murray said 
instead he said their tendency to blame it on all these 
folks is high 
on capitol hill in floor speeches and newsletters home members 
of congress often vent their anger over the crisis by blaming 
texas and that putupon feeling may be turning many texans off the 
issue analysts say 
layne hoppe a political scientist at texas lutheran college 
suggested texans feel a collective embarrassment about the failures 
of thrifts and banks 
if there were a reaction against it here it would be in a 
way a reaction against ourselves insofar as theres a texas 
identity he said 
texans are less likely than people in other states to get angry 
about tax dollars covering deposits at troubled texas thrifts 
some of the things that drive it as an issue nationally dont 
work so well here like resentment at shipping oney to texas 
murray said

and robbery charges 
acting justice herbert adlerberg denied a request by attorneys 
for yull gary morales 18 and luis fernando montero 22 for a 
reasonable bail for their clients the other lawyers did not 
request bail 
morales attorney joel lutwin argued that his client had lived 
in queens all his life and had no significant criminal record 
assistant district attorney tom schiels argued that morales made 
oral written and videotaped statements about the sept 2 killing 
of brian watkins 22 of provo utah 
watkins was knifed to death at a midtown subway station after 
the youths allegedly robbed watkins father of 200 and some credit 
cards slashed his pants with a box cutter and then punched and 
kicked his mother 
his murder touched off a wave of outrage among residents who are 
concerned at the growing number of murders and violent crimes in 
the city 
the family in town to attend the us open tennis tournament in 
queens had attended the tennis matches in the afternoon and were 
on their way to dinner when the robbery occurred

knife was found in morales home the day after the murder and

on them

showed others in the group the knife before the alleged mugging 
this case is going to try the city of new york lutwin said

going to see if we can get a fair and just trial despite the fact

everyone agrees this city is in deep fiscal 
trouble everyone disagrees on what to do about it 
philadelphia faces a 206 million deficit by june 30 the end of 
the fiscal year and wall street has turned up its nose at 
shortterm notes to keep the citys bills paid through may 
on friday mayor w wilson goode announced a hiring freeze and 
delays in pension fund payments and tax refunds freeing up 122 
million but the city still expects to go broke by dec 1 
if philadelphia has even a temporary period without sufficient 
cash the result will be a legal political and public safety 
nightmare finance director betsy c reveal said in a recent memo 
to goode 
political and business leaders are calling for a consensus but 
state elections this year and next years city elections seem to 
have stifled creativity 
no invited city or state officials joined a greater philadelphia 
chamber of commerce summit on the crisis last week except goode 
and the citys elected controller jonathan a saidel several 
elected officials including gov robert p casey sent 
representatives 
the only consensus you can get out of people in an election 
year is that its not my fault its his fault saidel said at 
an earlier luncheon with business and community leaders 
saidel a lawyer and accountant said that when he first learned 
city officials wanted to borrow a halfbillion dollars to keep the 
city afloat until may he asked what permanent solution they had in 
mind 
they told me that they didnt have a plan he said in the 
end i decided it was not good public policy in philadelphia to 
borrow this money i believed it was forestalling an inevitable 
decline in philadelphia and forestalling the cash problem doesnt 
solve anybodys problem 
in any case the city earlier this month couldnt find banks to 
guarantee the notes and wall street showed little interest 
bondrating services now rate philadelphias 13 billion in 
outstanding debt as risky as junk bonds 
few taxes can be raised or added without state approval the 
wage tax already is nearly 5 percent for city residents and 43 
percent for commuters among the highest rates in the nation the 
city council spurned goodes request last spring to raise wage 
taxes on city residents to 55 percent that would have raised 
588 million a year officials said 
philadelphia hasnt levied a sales tax since the early 1930s a 
proposal to impose a halfcent tax on top of the states 6 percent 
tax was passed by the city council but awaits action in 
electionwary harrisburg the increase would raise 45 million a 
year officials say 
budget cuts are another option but many expenses are locked in 
by longterm labor contracts im not convinced that they can 
solve this problem by cuts alone said colleen woodell a vice 
president for fitch investors service inc in new york 
city councilman james j tayoun proposed a financial oversight 
board similar to one that helped new york city avoid bankruptcy in 
the 1970s 
councilman david cohen urged withdrawal of city deposits from 
four local banks that refused to back loan notes 
organized labor also weighed in a coalition of unions 
representing 60000 city workers recommended closing tax loopholes 
adding cigarette and unearnedincome taxes and imposing a services 
fee on suburban residents 
goode had warned for years that the citys finances were shaky 
saying in 1989 a tax increase was needed to avoid a 305 million 
deficit by mid1991 
several tax increases he has proposed have stalled in the city 
council or the legislature state voters rejected a tax reform 
measure in 1989 that would have given philadelphia an option for a 
sales tax 
and there seems to be no mandate for any major change 
i dont sense that the great majority of folk in philadelphia 
yet realize the seriousness of the problem said john b neff 
president of frankford hospital so long as theyre not 
personally affected by it inertias a wonderful thing it could 
go on forever

members of the air forces 1st tactical 
fighter wing dont have to worry about satisfying a sweet tooth 
while on duty in saudi arabia 
the guys tell me were cookied out said sgt dana 
flores a spokeswoman for the wing stationed at langley air force 
base in hampton 
americans have opened their hearts and their baking ovens to 
military personnel involved in operation desert shield 
among the offerings 3500 peanut butter cookies baked by the 14 
nuns of the monastery of poor clare the nuns said many of the 
airmen deployed last month have volunteered to help around the 
monastery 
ms flores is responsible for seeing that donations from the 
public get to the wing while it is stationed overseas sometimes 
that means not sending everything that comes in she said 
especially if the offering could clash with saudi culture 
what people might not realize is that our troops are working 
sidebyside with the saudis one of our people might put down a 
book and a saudi pick it up and read it and perhaps be deeply 
offended by some part it could lead to an incident she said 
so ms flores has been going through the thousands of donated 
paperbacks weeding out those that might be a problem the books 
are judged by their covers suspected contents and author 
the saudi culture is a very religious one with very serious 
proscriptions against alcohol pork and what is perceived as 
pornography said mary anne tetreault an associate professor of 
political science at old dominion university in norfolk 
anything of a political nature especially anything to do with 
israel is also banned said ms tetreault who has spent several 
years in kuwait and the united arab emirates 
ms flores has had to discard numerous paperbacks whose covers 
are adorned with women wearing racy outfits magazines especially 
those with sexually suggestive advertisements are another 
headache ms flores said 
one young lady tried to send a pair of lacy panties to her 
man im afraid that just wont get through saudi customs she 
said 
however packages sent to sailors and marines aboard ships 
stationed in the red sea or persian gulf do not have to go through 
saudi customs said major tom johnston a spokesman for the navys 
atlantic fleet 
the air force has been flying donated supplies to the fighter 
wing as space allows ms flores said 
johnston said the navy has been encouraging people interested in 
sending things to the troops to write directly to them 
when youre overseas youre always looking for a letter from 
home even if you dont know the person who sent it i know from 
personal experience what an empty feeling mail call can be when you 
dont get anything he said 
johnston recommends a small set of checkers or chess a deck of 
cards or science fiction or western paperbacks for the navy men and 
women 
however ms flores asked that no more paperbacks be sent for 
the airmen were covered up in books right now what they 
are asking for is drink mixes anything powder they can mix with 
the water drinking straight water is apparently getting pretty 
boring 
talcum powder sports equipment and personal hygiene items also 
are appreciated ms flores said

federal health officials are collaborating 
with several hundred physicians in the united states and canada to 
gather more information about the progression of the infection that 
leads to aids 
the study will give medical researchers a better picture of 
which symptoms and diseases are most common in different groups of 
patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus or hiv 
which causes aids officials said in announcing the study monday 
it also will provide information on what treatments patients are 
using and will help researchers identify medical changes that occur 
as hiv infection progresses towards acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome 
health and human services secretary louis sullivan said the 
study was expected to result in the most comprehensive collection 
of information on hivinfected persons amassed in the history of 
the aids epidemic 
patient confidentiality will be protected he added 
the more information we have about hivinfected persons the 
faster we can advance our aids research said hhs assistant 
secretary for health james mason 
the study will allow researchers to compile a data base on a 
broad spectrum of hiv patients and will help physicians identify 
patients who can participate in clinical trials of experimental 
drugs officials said 
more than 30 communitybased clinics and programs in the united 
states and canada will participate in the study they include 18 
sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases and 15 sponsored by the american foundation for aids 
research 
several hundred physicians will be able to enroll patients they 
see at these clinics and programs as well as patients they see in 
their private practices these physicians care for more than 60000 
hivinfected patients according to the research foundation 
every three to six months during a regular clinic visit 
physicians will ask all patients in the study a set of questions 
about their health and the drugs they are taking

comedian rodney dangerfield has not found much 
to laugh about in his bitter court battle with caesars palace the 
hotel where he headlined until an alleged steam room accident 2 
years ago 
dangerfield filed a 5 million lawsuit against his former 
employer after caesars balked at paying him for shows he missed 
following the alleged accident in march of 1988 
testimony was scheduled to resume today closing arguments were 
scheduled for tuesday 
each side blames the other for eye problems the comedian claims 
he suffered from a burst of steam from a faulty steam bath 
mechanism caesars contends the injuries were a figment of a 
comedic imagination 
if dangerfield was looking for respect he found little of it in 
the twoweek trial before us district judge roger foley 
dangerfield 68 was portrayed as a vindictive foulmouthed 
malingerer by caesars attorneys who raked both the comedian and 
his case over the coals 
youre trying to make me out to be a liar and im not 
dangerfield said at one point during three days of combative 
testimony 
dangerfield testified he was wronged by caesars executives who 
didnt fully believe he was injured by the steam the comedian 
skipped four performances claiming his eyes were too sensitive to 
light to perform after returning for two shows he walked offstage 
without performing on closing night miffed at caesars for wanting 
to defer his 45000pershow pay for the nights he missed 
i just couldnt be funny for these people said dangerfield 
who advised the showroom crowd of 1200 to get refunds for both 
their seats and for any tips they gave showroom workers 
caesars in an effort to prove dangerfield wasnt hurt as badly 
as he claimed introduced evidence showing dangerfield went to the 
fights one night he was to perform and to see a comedy show 
another night a doctor who examined him following the steam bath 
incident said he thought dangerfield could perform 
eye specialists testified dangerfield had eye problems since the 
mid1970s and may have hurt himself further by his repeated use of 
a topical anaesthetic used in surgery on his eyes

states will be forced to take the lead in 
fighting spiraling healthcare costs because congress isnt likely 
to act soon leaders of a national governors conference said 
monday 
the problem is becoming so severe that if we dont steer 
ourselves toward a solution the problem is going to steer us 
toward bankruptcy said nevada gov bob miller 
washington gov booth gardner chairman of the national 
governors association said he was optimistic the states would 
handle the problem because we have no choice 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis said the governors want to 
determine why the united states is wasting money on health care 
this country is spending twice as much on health care as west 
germany the united kingdom japan or france dukakis said and 
25 percent to 30 percent again as much as canada yet those 
countries provide quality health care and we dont 
we have to understand whey we are spending twice as much for 
less he said 
gardner said congress was unlikely to legislate a health care 
program for several years but that states are addressing the 
problem because of statebudget shortfalls 
health care is analogous to the pac man of state government 
he said it is consuming a greater and greater share of state 
government

robert mapplethorpes photographs which have 
prompted obscenity charges against a cincinnati art gallery and its 
director are getting a far warmer reception here 
a top aids research lab plans to honor its namesake at a benefit 
next month and attempts to shut down an exhibition of 
mapplethorpes photographs in boston fizzled weeks ago 
jury selection began monday in the trial of director dennis 
barrie and the contemporary arts center in cincinnati where the 
sevenweek exhibit was shown last spring to record crowds 
friends and family of mapplethorpe who died of aids in march 
1989 will gather oct 4 to launch a fundraising campaign for the 
robert mapplethorpe laboratory for aids research at new england 
deaconess hospital in boston 
the hospital is hoping to raise 15 million to expand and 
renovate its aids research lab 
im finding people are focusing on aids research and treatment 
as opposed to the controversy surrounding the exhibit said 
benefit coordinator tom egan 
the robert mapplethorpe foundation which funds aids research 
and photography projects gave a 300000 grant to the hospital in 
march mapplethorpe died at age 42 while being treated at 
deaconess a harvard teaching hospital 
physicians at deaconess are trying to identify new drugs to 
treat aids which exposes the body to infection by crippling its 
immune system 
i think the research is something that a lot of people want to 
support the whole idea of a cure or a treatment in the future 
said egan its very longterm oriented 
the fundraiser will coincide with the final showing of robert 
mapplethorpe the perfect moment at bostons institute of 
contemporary art 
boston municipal clerk magistrate rosemary carr denied three 
complaints early this month against the exhibit which would have 
prompted an investigation by the district attorney 
although the exhibit was canceled at the corcoran art gallery in 
washington dc because of a furor over government funding for 
the national endowment for the arts it has appeared in several 
other cities without incident

every law enforcement official in the world would agree that

four people including a teenager set 
themselves ablaze monday in growing violence over the governments 
plan to set aside nearly half of its jobs for lowcaste hindus 
police hurled tear gas shells to disperse a mob near parliament 
and police headquarters in the capital was besieged for three hours 
by rampaging students who burned government vehicles buildings and 
train coaches 
united news of india said prime minister vp singh asked 
communications minister janeshwar mishra and a senior party leader 
sr bommai to open talks with the students to explain the job 
policy 
but singh must rescind the policy before they will talk said 
the students who claim the job quotas amount to reverse 
discrimination against uppercaste people 
in new delhi surinder singh chauhan 22 doused himself with 
gasoline from a motorcycle in the midst of thousands of students 
and set himself on fire with a match witnesses said 
kamal kishore sharma who rushed to chauhans aid said we 
were sitting under the tent when we saw a ball of black smoke 
and caught the stench of burning flesh 
safdarjang hospitals acting chief dr b chakravarty said 
chauhan suffered burns over his entire body and had no chance of 
survival 
a doctor at the hospital said on condition of anonymity that an 
18yearold was admitted to another new delhi hospital with burns 
over 70 percent of his body 
two other people attempted selfimmolation in jaipur a town 180 
miles southwest of new delhi united news of india said both were 
treated for thirddegree burns it said 
the traffic intersection where chauhan set himself afire has 
been taken over since thursday by thousands of students 
at least 25 people have been killed in street battles with 
police since wednesday and scores of students have attempted 
suicide by burning to protest the new government job policy 
the government employs 18 million people nationwide and singh 
announced on aug 7 that 49 percent of the prized jobs will be 
reserved for people of low castes who have been suppressed for 
years by indias rigid social system in that past 225 percent of 
the jobs had been set aside for low castes and native tribes 
under the new policy another 5 percent to 10 percent of 
government jobs will be reserved for the poor regardless of caste 
a doctor at the hospital said on condition of anonymity that an 
18yearold was admitted to another new delhi hospital with burns 
over 70 percent of his body 
two other people attempted selfimmolation in jaipur a town 180 
miles southwest of new delhi united news of india said both were 
treated for thirddegree burns it said 
student leaders sunday vowed not to lift the siege of the road 
intersection one of new delhis busiest even if we have to face 
military bullets 
a tent tied to traffic signals and lampposts is the nerve 
center street fences are ripped out and thrown across the streets 
to block traffic 
despite growing student opposition to the job quotas no 
political party has announced support for or opposition to the 
policy 
political analysts say the issue cannot threaten singhs 
minority government unless it gains the support of an established 
political group 
this is unlikely because political parties fear alienating the 
low castes which comprise more than 50 percent of indias 880 
million people the analysts say 
many opponents of the job program say it is aimed at securing 
votes rather than rendering social justice 
hindus who make up 82 percent of the population are divided 
into four castes and hundreds of subcastes which decide a 
persons social standing 
discrimination on the basis of caste is illegal but in practice 
the system permeates much of indian social life especially in 
villages

president bushs son neil goes before a judge 
tuesday in denver for a rare public hearing that could lead to his 
being barred from working for a bank or savings and loan 
federal regulators have accused bush 35 of conflict of 
interest in his former role as a director of silverado banking 
savings and loan association a denver thrift that failed in late 
1988 at an estimated cost to taxpayers of 1 billion 
the hearing before an administrative law judge is the 
centerpiece of the governments complex proceeding against bush 
which has taken the form of a paperwork battle since the office of 
thrift supervision filed the charges in february 
the ots is seeking an order against bush an oil and gas 
developer to effectively bar him from working for a bank or a 
savings and loan the agency contends that bush failed to 
adequately disclose to silverado his business relationships with 
developers kenneth m good and bill l walters two big borrowers 
from silverado who defaulted on their loans 
bush could have avoided a public hearing by agreeing not to 
dispute the conflictofinterest charges as other sampl officials 
have done in nearly all such previous cases by fighting the 
government he has taken the case out of attorneys and regulators 
offices into a public forum 
the swords are drawn bushs attorney james nesland said 
recently 
bush plans to testify in his own defense at the hearing which 
is expected to continue through most of the week 
although such a public hearing is almost unprecedented the 
participants dont expect any fireworks or courtroom drama in 
fact nesland said this is going to be an extraordinarily boring 
hearing 
thats because it will mainly be a replay of written testimony 
already submitted to the administrative law judge daniel j 
davidson regulators and outside experts will be crossexamined on 
that testimony by attorneys for the two sides 
the judge wont issue an opinion for some time and the 
government isnt expected to issue a ruling in the case until 
spring 
earlier this year five other former directors and officers of 
silverado including former chairman michael r wise and loan 
officer russell murray agreed not to dispute the ots 
administrative charges against them 
bush also faces a separate 200 million lawsuit filed last week 
against him and other silverado directors by the federal deposit 
insurance corp the civil suit accuses the directors including 
bush of gross negligence that contributed to silverados 
collapse 
since he appeared in may before a congressional committee 
investigating silverados collapse bushs fight with the 
regulators has consisted mostly of briefs and counterbriefs 
submitted to davidson 
now regulators journalists and davidson himself have trekked 
from washington to denver bushs home turf for the hearing 
starting tuesday in a federal courtroom the hearing before 
davidson is being held in denver because the nowdefunct silverado 
was based there 
bush is scheduled to be the final witness of 11 eight for the 
government and three for bush 
davidson is expected to make his recommendation by dec 6 to ots 
director timothy ryan 
the law judge could recommend that the regulators proposed 
ceaseanddesist order against bush be issued or he could advise 
against it the order would bar bush from engaging in future 
actions that would involve a conflict of interest 
davidson also could recommend a stronger prohibition order ots 
chief counsel harris weinstein said last week 
the ceaseanddesist order proposed by ots would stop short of 
banning bush from the financial institutions industry but could 
impose strict conditions on his holding such a job a prohibition 
order would be an absolute bar weinstein said 
a draft internal document written earlier this year by ots staff 
members recommended that a prohibition order also be issued against 
bush but the thrift agency later found there wasnt sufficient 
evidence to support a prohibition and the less serious 
ceaseanddesist order was proposed an ots spokesman has said 
under the administrative timetable ryan would make his decision 
by april 8 bush would have the right to appeal the decision most 
likely to the us court of appeals in denver

alexander lilov a member of the politburo under ousted 
communist hardliner todor zhivkov said he was stepping down in 
favor of a more pragmatic leader 
several members of the former communist hierarchy who helped 
engineer zhivkovs ouster last november have since had to 
relinquish senior posts 
premier andrei lukanov 52 is the only senior communist from 
the zhivkov era who still holds a top state post 
the communists renamed themselves the socialists last spring and 
went on to win junes first free elections in 58 years with 211 
seats in the 400seat parliament 
since then however their popularity has declined as bulgarias 
economic crisis has worsened basic foods such as sugar and cooking 
oil are rationed and power is cut regularly 
the socialists were forced to end weeks of deadlock over who 
should become state president by agreeing to the election of zhelyu 
zhelev leader of the democratic opposition in august 
but political tension continued to mount an angry crowd 
attacked burned and looted the socialist party headquarters on 
aug 26 
that attack reportedly was provoked by the socialists refusal 
to remove a red star from its headquarters on monday the congress 
voted to remove all such symbols of the communist era from party 
buildings nationwide and adopted a new emblem a white rose on red 
background and new flag 
lilov 57 became party leader only last february knowledgeable 
bulgarians say he has split rather than united the party 
the party congress decided monday that a new leader would be 
chosen by the whole congress and not just the partys council a 
leadership body with about 150 members the election was expected 
late monday or early tuesday 
in announcing his decision to step down lilov cited his links 
with the now disgraced zhivkov regime as one factor 
i have the responsibility for the time during which i was a 
politburo member of this party for more than ten years he 
told delegates 
we are still not a new party which thinks analyses and acts 
from a new position lilov said perhaps we are tired after 
holding power for over 45 years 
the party needs a leader who is worthier and more pragmatic 
than i am in short a better leader he said 
lukanov on sunday identified four reformers as possible 
successors to lilov 
they were dragan draganov alexander tomov petar emil mitev and 
asen zhablensky all belong to reform factions and none is 
associated with the zhivkov era 
lilov served as chief ideologist of the communist party until 
being dropped from the leadership by zhivkov in 1983 he rejoined 
the top ranks after zhivkovs ouster 
former president petar mladenov and former defense minister 
dobri dzhurov also lost their government posts this summer despite 
having engineered the communist party coup against zhivkov in 
november 
in heated weekend debates at the congress the leaders of four 
reform factions in the party called for a new younger leadership 
if no radical changes are made there will be a gradual 
disintegration of the party draganov said sunday

in the tradition of the tallmasted clipper ships 
that once raced across the oceans two sailors are taking aim at a 
136yearold record this fall in a san franciscotoboston sweep 
around treacherous cape horn 
skipper richard wilson who has suffered from asthma most of his 
life says hes in it to raise money for lung research and to find 
out what happens when youre cold and wet and tired and scared 
and youve got another 24 hours to go 
wilson and steve pettengill will be shooting for the record of 
76 days 6 hours set by the clipper northern light which roared 
into boston harbor in 1853 loaded with animal hides copper silk 
and fruit 
oct 22 is the tentative departure date for the 14000mile trip 
on the 60foot trimaran great american 
if we dont beat it then the experience will still be 
extraordinary i dont think theres anything else like this in 
sport wilson said we wont stop and there arent any repair 
ships along the way 
there arent any substitutes coming off the bench when you get 
tired there arent any timeouts 
galeforce wind seas over 100 feet and stretches of agonizing 
calm are likely in store for the 2month trip wilson said 
im certain well have some horrendous weather one of the 
great challenges is to just keep going day in and day out he 
said 
to raise money for the cost of the expedition and for the 
american lung association which has named wilson one of its 
superachievers the two will make daily progress reports 
accessible by calling 1900820boat calls cost 350 
several attempts in recent years to beat the times of the old 
speedy skippers are tribute to the continued fascination modernday 
sailors have for the graceful clipper ships that ruled the seas 
from about 1840 to 1870 
the clipper captains were motivated by the financial rewards of 
rushing supplies out to goldrich california or whisking fragrant 
teas and spices back from the orient to get the best price before a 
competitor reached port 
today the lure of the long grueling trips is the challenge of 
beating the elements said rich boehmer who keeps track of sailing 
records at his sail performance center in west bridgewater 
theyre extremely competitive people thats how they feel 
that they can becomeknown he said 
once begun the life of a longdistance sailor is hard to 
relinquish boehmer said 
people that do those kind of the things the rest of your 
life is boring he said 
wilson 40 said he got the idea for the record attempt after 
sailing in a singlehanded transatlantic race in 1988 
i thought that was the greatest experience i ever had but 
somehow there had to be a way to extend the benefit to other 
folks he said 
wilson who taught school briefly in boston is a participant in 
the student ocean challenge program and will visit schools before 
and after his trip to talk about geography history and seagoing 
life 
pettengill is from grand rapids mich 
the voyage did not draw a corporate sponsor and wilson said he 
hopes to convince the public that there is more to yachting 
endeavors than the americas cup races every four years 
he said the san franciscoboston trip probably wont be his last 
crack at the record books 
you get great satisfaction you get a great experience that 
you cant get on land you gain knowledge you gain confidence you 
get in tremendous physical shape you get a lot of things he

the supreme soviet legislature voted monday to 
move toward a westernstyle market economy and gave president 
mikhail s gorbachev sweeping new powers to make the switch 
despite warnings by some lawmakers that the special powers would 
make gorbachev a virtual monarch the legislature passed a 
resolution allowing him to issue decrees on property wages 
prices the national budget the financial system and law and 
order 
gorbachev promised to exercise the powers with care 
its a responsibility he told the legislature its not a 
tea party 
after rancorous debate the lawmakers were unable to agree on a 
specific stepbystep program to move away from the central 
planning system that they blame for technological backwardness and 
shortages of housing food and consumer goods 
instead of choosing one of the three plans presented in the past 
two weeks the supreme soviet set up a committee to combine them 
and report back by oct 15 
despite disagreement on how to make the switch the supreme 
soviets vote marked the first time it has committed the country to 
a marketbased system and was a departure from seven decades of 
communist economics 
since the 1920s ministries in moscow have kept a tight grip on 
the economy issuing detailed fiveyear plans that told thousands 
of factories farms and businesses what to produce where to sell 
it and how much to charge 
the most radical reform proposal written by economist stanislav 
shatalin calls for junking the central planning system and moving 
to a market economy within 500 days by selling factories to private 
owners and breaking up collective farms 
the most conservative proposal backed by prime minister nikolai 
ryzhkov would leave the government in control of most of the 
economy while moving gradually to allow free enterprise 
gorbachev has backed a compromise that contains many elements of 
the 500day plan but would not move as fast he also wants a 
national referendum to decide whether to return land to private 
farmers 
before and during thesupreme soviets meeting protesters 
gathered outside the kremlin and at pushkin square in downtown 
moscow to condemn the decision to give the president additional 
powers they said gorbachev did not deserve such authority because 
he was not elected by direct vote of the people 
the people dont trust gorbachev shouted a group of 
demonstrators outside the kremlins spassky gate they held signs 
saying a president not an emperor and all decrees of the 
president are battles against democracy 
gorbachev was elected to a fiveyear term as president by the 
supreme soviet in march previously his power had come from his 
position as general secretary of the communist party which he has 
held since 1985 
the legislature voted 30546 with 41 abstentions to allow 
gorbachev the special powers until march 31 1992 the time limit 
was intended to cover a 500day economic reform plan should one be 
approved 
the action put the supreme soviet on a collision course with the 
parliament of the russian federation the largest of the soviet 
unions 15 constituent republics 
on saturday russias president boris yeltsin and other leaders 
of the russian parliament declared that gorbachevs request for 
additional power was unacceptable because it would allow him to 
infringe on the republics sovereignty 
the russian parliament has adopted shatalins 500day plan and 
threatened to put it into effect on its own 
the supreme soviet was ambiguous about the extent to which it 
will review gorbachevs decisions its resolution said he would 
have the right to issue urgent decrees if the supreme soviet does 
not find it necessary to establish other rules or does not 
recommend that the president change or replace his decisions 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak a lawyer objected to the word 
recommend and urged the legislature to adopt clearer language 
requiring its review and approval of all presidential economic 
decrees but his amendment was defeated on a vote of 21194 with 70 
abstentions 
another legislator from leningrad yuri boldyrev complained the 
resolution gave gorbachev absolutely unlimited powers and a 
lawmaker who did not identify himself told the legislature it would 
make the president into a monarch 
but the legislature rejected a series of amendments designed to 
limit the presidents new powers 
ryzhkov the prime minister later told reporters there was no 
possibility that gorbachev will become a dictator 
gorbachev is the first really parliamentary leader in 
russia he said

the international monetary fund gave its 
support monday to an accelerated effort to supply billions of 
dollars to poor countries harmed by the persian gulf crisis as the 
bush administration worked behind the scenes to flesh out details 
of the assistance package 
the approval by the imfs policymaking interim committee was 
announced in a communique that stressed the international lending 
agency would respond on an expedited basis to present 
difficulties 
the imf approval followed promises by world bank president 
barber conable that his agency stood ready to increase its lending 
as a result of the mideast turmoil 
the bush administration is counting on both the imf and the 
world bank to provide significant support to bolster the trade 
embargo against iraqi president saddam hussein 
in addition president bush earlier this month dispatched 
treasury secretary nicholas brady and secretary of state james a 
baker iii on global fundraising missions seeking pledges of support 
from individual countries 
so far the administration has received commitments of 20 
billion divided equally between support for the us military 
buildup in the mideast and assistance for the socalled front line 
states of egypt turkey and jordan 
the administration is concerned that the trade embargo against 
iraq will not succeed without significant aid flowing to countries 
harmed economically either by the loss of export markets or a jump 
in oil prices 
the imf communique provided no specifics on how much money would 
be forthcoming but did list a variety of imf programs that could be 
tapped for money including a compensatory fund used in the past to 
aid nations hit by earthquakes and hurricanes 
canadian finance minister michael wilson the chairman of the 
imf interim committee denied that the lack of specifics reflected 
any dissension among the 22 finance ministers who spent sunday and 
early monday crafting the imf policy 
we recognized the urgency of the needs of the people who are 
affected wilson told reporters the urgency is stated the 
framework is provided and now it is up to the imf management to 
respond 
echoing remarks made by conable last week imf managing director 
michel camdessus said he believed the emergency aid could start 
flowing early in 1991 
the persian gulf crisis has become the central focus of the 
annual meetings of the imf and world bank being attended by 
representatives of the 152 nations that are members of the two 
institutions president bush was scheduled to address the finance 
officials on tuesday 
the administration held a series of meetings behind the scenes 
monday in an effort to tie up loose ends of the financing packages 
treasury department aides were meeting with representatives from 
japan west germany britain france canada italy saudi arabia 
the united arab emirates south korea and the 12nation european 
community in an effort to reach agreement on financing details 
these workinggroup meetings were to be followed on wednesday 
with discussions at a higher level led by treasury undersecretary 
david mulford 
horst koehler an official in the west germany finance ministry 
said that the discussions were being held to settle on an exact 
dollar amount of required assistance but us officials said the 
talks were covering a broader range of issues including the 
mechanisms to be used to funnel the aid to needy countries 
just three weeks ago the administration said it wanted to raise 
105 billion to meet the needs of egypt jordan and turkey through 
the end of next year however us officials who spoke on 
condition of anonymity said monday that the range now being 
considered was 12 billion to 14 billion in economic assistance to 
the three frontline nations with changing economic circumstances 
such as higher oil prices blamed for the revised figure 
in addition to this assistance the united states is also 
seeking billions of dollars in additional contributions to other 
countries hurt by the jump in oil prices 
nations mentioned for this group include the emerging 
democracies of eastern europe which are about to lose their access 
to cutrate oil from the soviet union as well as such third world 
countries as the philippines india and brazil

syrian president hafez assad held his 
third meeting in three days with president hashemi rafsanjani on 
monday after extending his visit to tehran the official iranian 
news agency said 
assads talks are believed to have focused on irans role in the 
united nations embargo against iraq and on the plight of 13 
western hostages held in lebanon 
the islamic republic news agency provided no details about assad 
and rafsanjanis latest meeting 
assad who arrived in tehran saturday for what was to have been 
a threeday visit decided to stay longer than scheduled due to 
the importance of the issues under discussion and the need to 
complete consultations irna said 
assad is irans key arab ally and an archrival of iraqs saddam 
hussein 
his visit to tehran followed talks with secretary of state james 
a baker iii in damascus earlier this month washington apparently 
wants assad to use the leverage he gained from supporting iran 
during its eightyear war with iraq on the hostage and embargo 
isses 
tehran has hinted that it would allow humanitarian shipments 
of food and medical supplies into iraq regardless of the embargo 
imposed by the un security council after iraqs aug 2 takeover 
of kuwait 
however irna reported monday that iranian authorities had 
arrested 29 smugglers accused of trying to move foodstuffs across 
the border into iraq to circumvent the un embargo 
iran has criticized the invasion of kuwait but it also has 
deplored the usled western forces deployed in saudi arabia and 
the region 
assad has stressed to the iranians that the us military 
presence in the persian gulf is not permanent and that it would end 
if saddam relinquished kuwait 
assad himself sent some 4000 troops to join the usled 
multinational force in saudi arabia and has pledged to send 
another 15000 men 
iraq abruptly moved to make peace with iran after the invasion 
of kuwait the move freed up iraqi troops that had occupied iranian 
border areas since fighting ended in the 198088 iraniraq war 
diplomats in damascus and tehran have said the plight of the 13 
western hostages in lebanon is a main topic on assads agenda in 
tehran 
most of the six americans four britons two west germans and an 
italian are held by shiite moslem factions linked to the 
fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god it is tehrans main ally 
in lebanon where syria is the major power broker 
the longestheld hostage is terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent of the associated press who was abducted march 16

five statewide voter initiatives including a 
farreaching proposal to allow tax credits for churchsponsored 
schools arent eligible to be on the nov 6 ballot a judge ruled 
monday 
marion county circuit judge richard barbers ruling could lead 
to removal of all eight initiatives from the ballot 
because of printing deadlines barber said the measures could 
stay on the ballot but that votes for or against could not be 
counted 
barber said the proposals no longer qualify for the ballot 
because they wont be accompanied by financial impact statements as 
required by state law 
the measures would limit property taxes shut down the trojan 
nuclear plant ban some nonrecyclable packaging establish a pilot 
work in lieu of welfare program and allow tax credits for sending 
children to private schools 
the school funding measure would grant state income tax credits 
of up to 2500 a year for pupils at private schools including 
churchsupported schools and for children taught at home it also 
would allow parents to send their children across district lines to 
any public school 
barbers decision was an outgrowth of earlier marion county 
circuit court rulings that the fiscal statements couldnt appear on 
the ballot because they werent certified by state officials by a 
legal deadline 
barber said the legislature intended that measures not appear on 
the ballot without the required statements of financial effects 
state officials were considering an appeal of mondays ruling

billion to a record 2417 billion in august but could be reduced 
before the fiscal year ends sept 30 the treasury department 
reported monday 
the 67 percent surge over the comparable 11 months of 1989 
boosted the spending imbalance well over the record of 2211 
billion posted in fiscal 1986 the august total however fell 
short of the onemonth record of 533 billion set last march 
we used to have years that were that bad economist bruce 
steinberg of merrill lynch said of the august deficit 
the department said about 25 billion of the august deficit 
reflected a shift of payments normally made in september such as 
military pay and social security checks to the previous month to 
avoid labor day weekend delays 
this will affect septembers results by 25 billion as 
compared to last year it said in a statement 
still without the 25 billion early payment the deficit so far 
this fiscal year would have totaled 2169 billion the deficit in 
september 1989 was 61 billion 
the bush administration had forecast a 2185 billion imbalance 
for all of fiscal 1990 
white house and congressional negotiators are trying to reach 
agreement on reducing the deficit by 50 billion in the fiscal year 
starting oct 1 and 500 billion over the next five years 
without an agreement the white house estimates the fiscal 1991 
deficit will total 2323 billion 
revenues in august totaled 785 billion up 31 percent from 
the comparable month in 1989 but the receipts were offset by 
1312 billion in outlays a 335 percent gain over august 1989 
in addition to the early payments the spending bill included 
26 billion for the resolution trust corp the government agency 
charged with bailing out the savings and loan industry the sampl 
bailout cost 32 billion in july and 378 billion so far this 
year 
the government hopes to regain much of the bailout cost by 
selling real estate loans securities and other assets from failed 
thrifts that would help reduce the deficit in future years 
its just a continuation of the trends weve been seeing 
steinberg said receipts are not that strong because the economy 
is weakening 
revenues for the first 11 months totaled 9286 billion up 42 
percent from the first 11 months of last year spending during the 
period totaled 12 trillion 128 percent over the comparable 
period of 1989 
as usual the biggest spending categories were the military 
social security and other programs of the department of health and 
human services and interest on the national debt 
military spending totaled 278 billion in august and 2692 
billion so far this year it is projected to total 2902 billion 
for the entire fiscal year 
social security payments amounted to 412 billion for the month 
and 2442 billion for the year they are projected to total 2449 
billion for the year 
other hhs payments including medicare and medicaid totaled 
183 billion in august and 1797 billion for 1990 so far they 
are projected to total 1924 billion in fiscal 1990 
interest on the national debt amounted to 189 billion for the 
month and 2476 billion so far this year such interest is 
projected to total 2611 billion for the entire year

while their leaders hedged and debated an economic 
rescue plan soviet consumers have lost patience with dwindling 
supplies of even basic goods such as bread cigarettes matches and 
paper 
last week president mikhail s gorbachev admitted the soviet 
union had run out of time as well 
we must move and act gorbachev scolded legislators friday 
when they failed to muster a quorum to act on economic reform 
dont wait 
after months of indecision over what path to take the soviet 
parliament voted monday to accept in principle a plan to move to a 
free market economy and reject central planning 
but the journey soviet officials have taken to the market this 
year has been a slow one with reverses and setbacks 
in the spring prime minister nikolai ryzhkov drew up an 
economic reform plan that called for continued central planning a 
strong central government and a slow transition to the market but 
it was quickly rejected by the parliament and returned to him for 
reworking its call for doubling and tripling prices on some basic 
consumer goods also set off a wave of panic buying 
when ryzhkovs reworked plan was submitted to lawmakers earlier 
this month it was criticized as little different than the 
original 
a radical plan drawn up by economist stanislav shatalin also was 
submitted to parliament this month it proposes a 500day 
transition that includes sovereignty for the 15 soviet republics 
sale of state property to private owners decollectivization of 
farming land reform cutting the military and kgb budgets and 
deregulating most prices while freezing the costs of 150 essential 
goods 
the shatalin plan was passed by the parliament of the russian 
republic the nations largest political subdivision on sept 
11 
a committee appointed by gorbachev then put together a 
compromise that has many elements of shatalins plan but rejects 
some key provisions including those on decollectivization and 
sovereignty for the republics 
while the various proposals have been hammered out things have 
worsened gorbachev himself says the nation has entered an 
economic depression and frustrated shoppers have become more 
agitated 
after an acute shortage of cigarettes all summer the nations 
smokers began to register their anger with demonstrations and 
strikes they began in the smaller cities of the russian republic 
and spread to leningrad and moscow where protesters blocked the 
streets until truckloads of cigarettes arrived 
hundreds of people demanding better supplies of food tobacco 
alcohol and consumer goods rioted in the ural mountains city of 
chelyabinsk in august 
bread rationing was instituted in one city near moscow at the 
end of the summer and the capitals supplies of the traditionally 
plentiful russian staple ran short for about two weeks 
we are sick and tired of empty shops and devalued money we 
want no more crises moscow mayor gavriil popov an opponent of 
gorbachevs told thousands of people rallying at the kremlin on 
sept 16 
factories and farms in some cities suffering through shortages 
have refused to ship their goods to other cities or republics 
ryzhkov went on nationwide television sunday night and told of a 
very serious shortfall in the current harvest of potatoes and 
other vegetables with only a third of the crop collected such a 
warning is ominous as the nation prepares for winter 
but even mondays first step toward the market was not without 
disagreement debate and further delay 
the economic blueprints before lawmakers will be merged into one 
plan by a committee of legislators and economists by oct 15 a 
further wait of three weeks

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev who noted menns death in 
the national parliament has demanded a thorough investigation 
of the slaying 
the official tass news agency without quoting any sources by 
name said in a brief report it had learned several peoptained on suspicion 
of killing menn 
the case is being investigated by the le have 
been deinterior ministry of the 
russian republic tass said under a unit headed by deputy interior 
minister vyacheslav pankin 
after his death menn was praised by the government newspaper 
izvestia as a pastor to many human rights champions prisoners of 
conscience those persecuted by the authorities 
a theologian and a church historian menn wrote several books 
and articles as well as a childrens book his popular history of 
comparative religion was publishedan hour last tuesday 
hogan said that because of the two major summer blackouts the 
media is reporting minor problems that previously would have been 
ignored 
edison has blamed the west side blackouts on a problem at a 
generating plant and other failures on damaged cables and animals 
chewing power lines 
still hogan said edison maintains a 9998 percent reliability 
factor 
we dont have any reason to believe the total infrastructure 
is in jeopardy hogan said 
even so the daley administration insists a buyout is a real 
alternative 
this is not a bargaining chip daley spokeswoman carolyn 
grisko said friday this is a possibility 
the current agreement gives the city the right to purchase comm 
eds system within the citys limits an option first given 
serious consideration in 1985 under the late mayor harold 
washingtons administration 
but other issues besides the buyout are on the table including 
how much money the utility pays the city for the right to operate 
here currently the utility pays chicago 4 percent of its gross 
receipts which last year was in excess of 72 million hogan 
said 
consumer groups such as citizens utility board are asking the 
city to consider a new franchise that would require commonwealth 
edison to work harder to cut customer costs 
residential commonwealth edison customers paid 107 cents per 
kilowatt hour for electricity in 1988 compared with a national 
average of 75 cents according to the power association 
edison financial analysts say the utility also has a lot to lose 
in the talks 
chicago represents a large portion of the companys sales 
said linda byus a utility analyst for duff amp phelps in chicago 
its image also is linked closely to the city which may help forge 
an amicable agreement between the two she said

helmut kohl who will lead a united 
germany within two weeks on monday dismissed claims he is too busy 
with unification to become seriously involved in global affairs 
such as the persian gulf crisis 
in a meeting with the ap board of directors kohl maintained 
that german unity will release fresh energies for assisting 
third world nations and for helping maintain world peace 
the germans are by no means preoccupied only with their own 
affairs kohl said in a written statement prepared for the 
associated press 
the west german chancellor also answered ap board members 
questions elaborating on many of the same themes but said his 
comments during the meeting were not for publication 
kohl becomes chancellor of all germany when the east and west 
unite on oct 3 he stands a good chance of being reelected on 
dec 2 the date of the first allgerman elections in 57 years 
kohl spoke with the ap board of directors for nearly two hours 
at the chancellery 
he released a written statement to the board containing his 
latest views on a united germanys role in world politics and other 
matters 
many of kohls remarks focused on the global responsibilities of 
a united germany and how they mesh with the political integration 
of europe as a whole 
the chancellor expressed deep gratitude to president bush for 
being the first western leader to affirm the germans right to 
unify 
i wish to single out in particular the contribution made by 
the united states of america kohl said 
he also said he and bush are both interested in seeing serious 
economic reform succeed in the soviet union the germans have 
committed themselves to providing large sums of money to help out 
the soviets 
a successful outcome to these reforms serves us all he 
said 
kohl destined to go into the history books as the architect of 
german unity rejected charges by his political rivals that he 
rushed unification to advance his own career he said the east 
germans determined the pace 
kohl said a mammoth challenge lies ahead because the german 
nations followed drastically different paths after their separation 
four decades ago 
germans will have to show great empathy and understanding in 
order to overcome both the physical and the mental divisions 
between us he said 
people in the impoverished east cannot expect us to create 
equal standards of living for them overnight kohl added 
he rebuffed criticism from some us congressmen and officials 
in other nations that the germans dont want serious global 
responsibilities 
the accusations were made after west germany said its 
constitution barred it from sending soldiers to assist the usled 
multinational forces deployed in the persian gulf after iraq 
invaded kuwait on aug 2 
since then west germany has promised a large financial package 
to help in the gulf crisis 
kohl argued that his policies do have global implications 
for example kohl said he is committed to the political union 
of europe 
we are striving for tangible progress towards a common 
external and security policy within the 12nation european 
economic community he said in his statement 
he said a united germany would not seek the leading role in 
europe but intends to live up to our responsibility in europe 
and in the world 
my government will therefore continue to support the 
international efforts to curb iraqs policy of expansion and to 
restore the territorial integrity of kuwait he said 
the unification of germany and its commitments in a changing 
europe will not prompt us to neglect problems in other parts of the 
world kohl said on the contrary german unification will 
release fresh energies 
in the long run germany and europe as a whole will possess 
additional resources for contributing to economic and social 
development in the third world and to the safeguarding of peace 
worldwide he added

iraq underscoring its control over 
kuwait has declared kuwaits currency invalid and set a deadline 
for all who hold it to exchange it for iraqi money the government 
said monday 
iraq will reimburse those who possess kuwaiti dinars with iraqi 
dinars on a 1for1 basis the government said those who hold 
kuwaiti dinars have until oct 6 to exchange it for iraqi currency 
said the announcement carried by state iraqi news agency 
after that date kuwaiti dinars will be considered worthless 
the baghdad government said 
iraq has methodically dismantled kuwaiti institutions following 
its aug 2 invasion and annexation of kuwait iraqi authorities 
have officially disbanded kuwaits government military and 
national airline and call kuwait iraqs 19th province 
the currency measure was taken to facilitate transactions 
throughout iraq and ending duality in the monetary dealing the 
government said 
before iraqi president saddam hussein ordered his army into 
kuwait one iraqi dinar was worth 322 and one kuwaiti dinar 
traded at 345 at official rates 
but the kuwaiti currency was convertible on international 
markets while the iraq dinar was not the iraqi currency remains 
inconvertible 
the decision was also expected to eliminate the black market for 
the kuwaiti dinar although the iraqi dinars official value 
remains the same its value to buy goods or foreign currency on the 
black market was about onetenth the official rate iraq punishes 
currency smugglers with death 
in the first days of the invasion the kuwaiti dinar fell from 
345 to about onefifth its value before international currency 
exchanges suspended trading of the kuwaiti currency 
no banks will accept to quote or trade either iraqi or kuwaiti 
dinars a banque francaise du commerce exterieur official said 
monday that would be forbidden under the freeze on kuwaiti and 
iraqi assets adopted by france and the other european community 
countries the parisbased official said in an interview 
he said even if there were no economic embargo no one would 
trade the kuwaiti dinar because there is no longer any central bank 
to guarantee its value anyone with kuwaiti dinars outside the 
country would effectively be holding useless paper the banker 
said 
there are exceptions in extremely limited circumstances 
kuwaitis stranded in london can go to the national bank of kuwait 
or united bank of kuwait and get british pounds for their dinars if 
they have dinar accounts there and can prove that they are in 
desperate need of funds according to a financial source in 
bahrain 
the banque misr or bank of egypt in cairo has not been 
instructed to stop accepting the kuwaiti dinar an official of the 
banks foreign exchange department said the currency was quoted in 
mondays fixtures as usual though at 286 
when the crisis erupted the egyptiansaudi finance bank allowed 
kuwaitis to exchange 500 dinars at the old rate for two days any 
other funds had to be exchanged at the reduced rate 
the practice appeared part of the exile aid program run by the 
kuwaiti government itself in exile in saudi arabia the financial 
source in bahrain said 
certain local banks may have been given a guarantee by kuwaiti 
embassies allowing them to exchange dinars to needy kuwaiti 
citizens the source said 
but it would be impossible for the kuwaiti governmentinexile 
to honor all dinars because iraq could then try to convert the 
huge stocks of kuwaiti cash its soldiers plundered during the 
invasion the source noted 
the fall of kuwait made instant paupers out of tens of thousands 
of people with assets in kuwait or kuwaiti currency 
h zahreddin a wealthy lebanese businessman doing business in 
kuwait flew home to lebanon the day before iraq overran kuwait to 
throw a lavish wedding party for his daughter at a plush beirut 
hotel 
i went to bed a millionaire and woke up in debt zahreddin 
said later the hotel refused to accept my kuwaiti dinar check to 
settle the bill

the district of columbia has room for less 
than 1 percent of its drug abusers in its comprehensive cityrun 
treatment programs according to a study released monday 
this study shows that the city has not waged a war on drugs 
said emanuel chatman an accounting professor at the university of 
the district of columbia who compiled the report with two fellow 
udc professors 
the city is woefully behind on the treatment end of the 
equation and the commander in chief has not been in charge 
chatman said 
the report which also predicted that the city will set another 
homicide record this year comes less than two months after mayor 
marion barry was convicted of a misdemeanor cocaine possession 
charge in the weeks following barrys arrest on drug charges in 
january the mayor enrolled in private substance abuse treatment 
centers in florida and south carolina 
city officials have estimated that there are 76000 drug abusers 
in the nations capital 
but there are only 460 beds available in city run drugtreatment 
centers plus 700 more in postrecovery or relapse treatment 
centers the study found 
given the number of drug addicts the number of beds for 
detoxification is extremely small said ann hughes an urban 
studies professor who also worked on the 18month survey of 37 
cityrun programs 
the report also says that of the 500 million city officials say 
is being spent to fight drugs in the district treatment programs 
receive just 103 million 
it is clear that our priorities need to be reversed said 
udc political science professor joseph drew money for this 
should be considered from the other 490 million being spent in the 
war on drugs 
the researchers predicted that if the current homicide rate 
continues the city will have 471 murders in 1990 compared with 
438 last year 
through sept 22 this year the city had suffered 342 homicides 
compared with 325 at the same time last year police blame drugs 
particularly turf battles among crack cocaine dealers for more 
than 60 percent of these killings 
the study recommended that the city establish minimum standards 
for prevention and education and do a better job of publicizing 
available services 
the report was based on unannounced visits paid to city drug 
clinics 
we wanted to surprise them to keep them from cleaning up 
their acts and getting ready for us said hughes 
annette jones who chairs the mayors advisory committee on drug 
abuse said barry had reviewed and accepted the groups 
conclusions

really wasnt any way we could see out at all dow said 
the impact also broke a utility light in the cockpit causing 
sparks 
landing conditions at ellsworth were bad because of rain and low 
clouds 
the instructor pilot maj tom owskey had to take over the 
controls because he had the best view 
ground crews directed the landing by radio 
the broken windscreens were reflecting three or four different 
runways owskey said i basically had to be talked down to 
the left or right of the center line and i was maneuvering to 
make a safe approach 
it was the first time the crew of four had flown together 
they obviously did a great job when you think what they had 
to handle said wing commander col ron henderson they were 
very calm throughout the entire emergency everybody was 
it was a team effort on the ground with a lot of people 
involved

a carbide oven exploded at a chemical 
plant in transylvania on monday killing five people and injuring 
10 state radio said 
two of the injured were reported in critical condition 
experts ruled out sabotage and said early findings indicated the 
explosion in tirnaveni 240 miles north of the capital was 
probably caused by a mixture of air and carbon monoxide gases that 
collected near the furnace 
the blast came as the furnace was being prepared for operation 
after five weeks of routine maintenance checks the radio quoted 
sources at the plant as saying 
it said damage could total 1 million 
the government later called urgently for a law to form a special 
military corps to guard important industrial plants nationwide the 
state news agency rompres reported 
however the decision seemed to arise from increased pilfering 
at stateowned works government officials have indicated that the 
theft of spare parts or damage to plants during breakins could 
lead to major industrial accidents like mondays 
the explosion was the third in wwo months at chemical plants in 
transylvania but a government statement said the number of 
industrial accidents was half of last years

in what us officials are describing as a 
breakthrough the angolan government has agreed to allow the 
prompt and efficient delivery of food supplies to tens of 
thousands of angolans who face starvation because of drought 
the bush administrations expert on foreign disaster relief 
andrew natsios revealed monday the angolan commitment that had 
been made in a joint statement us and angolan officials agreed to 
last wednesday 
angolan officials had snubbed natsios in luanda two weeks ago 
but the leftist government apparently then underwent a change of 
heart 
last week natsios met with angolan gen antonio dos santos 
ndalu at an undisclosed location and received assurances of the 
angolan governments willingness to allow relief supplies under 
united nations auspices to reach hungry angolans both in 
government and rebelheld territory 
a civil war has raged in angola since 1976 and the united 
states has provided aid to the unita rebel group since 1986 
natsios told reporters he saw the effects of the drought during 
a visit to the affected areas at one location he saw children who 
had eaten only two or three meals in a week at another village 
five children had had only mice to eat in the preceding days 
he described the angolan commitment as a breakthrough but said 
he would withhold further judgment until the plan is implemented 
angolan officials have said that 2 million people live in the 
droughtaffected area unita officials have indicated that the 
number of hungry angolans could be 750000 
natsios said a more precise estimate of the number of angolans 
whose lives are at risk would have to await a report by a un 
assessment team 
the usangolan statement said the two sides agreed on the 
need for prompt and efficient delivery of relief supplies to all 
affected populations in angola the us side reiterated its 
commitment to join with other donors in the unled effort to 
provide the necessary assistance to angola 
angola has been wary about outside food aid because of concern 
that the united states might try to use food shipments as a cover 
for weapons earmarked for anticommunist rebels 
a us official insisting on anonymity said the angolan 
government may be showing flexibility on the humanitarian aid issue 
to influence pending congressional deliberations about future aid 
to unita the angolan government strongly opposes such aid 
the communique also said the angolan side advised the us side 
that relief supplies would be allowed to enter angola from 
neighboring states by the fastest and most efficient routes 
the namibian government has agreed to let food shipments be sent 
to angola through its territory another possibility is deliveries 
through zimbabwe which has a food surplus natsios said

what do dr seuss stephen king and the editors 
of websters dictionary have in common theirs are among the scores 
of books banned or challenged in the past year the american 
library association said monday in launching banned books week 
we need to bring to the attention of american public the fact 
that our first amendment rights are under attack said judith 
krug director of the associations office for intellectual 
freedom 
a websters dictionary edition was challenged in the upper 
pittsgrove township nj school district because parents objected 
to the definition of sexual intercourse as the sexual joining of 
two individuals said paul whitman secretary of the school 
board 
the 1986 dictionary an edition edited especially for 
teenagers was removed from fourth and fifth grade classrooms 
last fall but continues to be used in upper levels he said 
whitman said he didnt know what portion of the definition provoked 
the challenge 
the lorax by dr seuss was challenged in a laytonville 
calif school district last september parents working for a local 
logging company said the book portrayed their industry negatively 
the book remained on the secondgrade required reading list 
after the challenge but teachers voluntarily moved it to an 
optional list the following spring said superintendent brian 
buckley 
stephen kings the stand was restricted to ninthgrade 
students with parental consent at whitford intermediate school in 
beaverton ore after some parents objected to violence and sexual 
language and another king novel christine was pulled from 
the library at washington middle school in meriden conn after a 
parent complained about offensive passages 
these are only a few of the incidents reported to the 
51000member educational association between may 1989 and may 
1990 krug said calling banned books week a celebration of our 
freedom to read 
the week runs through sept 29 its part of a national effort 
to draw attention to the more than 1000 instances of challenging 
or banning books reported last year krug said 
only 15 percent of censorship attempts ever reach the light of 
day krug said weve proven time and time again that 
censorship dies in the light of day we want to have the 
opportunity for the public to look at the issue from all sides 
were here to help librarians teachers and other concerned 
citizens keep reading materials available to the public she 
said theres a lot of covert censorship going on 
krug said she advises librarians and teachers to set specific 
policies and procedures on censorship but professionals arent the 
only ones who should be involved in the issue concerned parents 
she said should make their views known at school board meetings or 
in letters to newspaper editors 
as individual citizens we have to stand up and be counted 
krug said we have to join the battle

nuclear test missiles sent to ki sawyer 
air force base were leaking jet fuel and posed the danger of 
explosion according to a report to congress 
the report by the general accounting office says 10 of 25 test 
missiles delivered to the northern michigan base developed fuel 
leaks seven were returned to the manufacturer for repair and three 
were repaired at sawyer 
the report said the strategic air command ordered sawyer to 
isolate the missiles from other weapons because of the potential 
for explosion 
sawyer officials refused monday to comment on the report 
referring questions to sac leaders in omaha neb its sacs 
program we havent even seen the report said saywer spokeswoman 
sgt anita bailey 
program spokesman capt harry edwards at sac headquarters media 
affairs office in omaha said he has never seen the gao report and 
could not comment 
in an appendix to the report david j berteau a principal 
deputy to the assistant air force secretary for production and 
logistics said the leaks have been corrected with the development 
of new fuel bladders 
the gao report which was finished in april and released in 
early september maligns the advanced cruise missile program as 
costly and unreliable the missile an updated version of the air 
launched cruise missile can be armed with a nuclear warhead and 
uses stealth technology to evade radar detection 
the main contractor for the missiles is general dynamics convair 
division 
the report says the air force may have wasted 50 million on the 
424 million program including 30 million spent on construction 
at an unspecified air force base that will no longer handle the 
missile 
an air force response printed with the report defends the 
program saying its reliability compares favorably to that of 
other cruise missiles at the same period of development

the leftist sandinista front on monday 
announced a new round of strikes to block the governments plans to 
sell stateowned companies and lay off civil servants 
after a meeting saturday of the 103member sandinista assembly 
the front said staggered partial strikes would begin this week and 
build to nationwide demonstrations on oct 1 
we are against the attitude of the government that is intent 
on imposing an economic plan that makes the rich richer and the 
poor poorer the sandinistas said in a communique 
public transportation employees were the only ones who walked 
out on monday workers seized control of government bus depots and 
burned tires outside them sending black plumes of smoke into the 
air 
only a few police were patrolling the depots the government has 
been reluctant to try to call in the sandinistacontrolled police 
to restrain the strikes the sandinistas still control the army as 
well 
since losing elections in february the sandinistas have been 
intent on showing they can rule from below in the words of 
former president daniel ortega 
general strikes in may and july temporarily paralyzed the 
country with street marches and takeovers of state businesses and 
industries 
after 10 years in power the sandinistas can quickly mobilize 
thousands to back their programs the government coalition has no 
such grassroots organization and as a result is blocked from 
carrying out programs the sandinistas oppose 
government officials business leaders and some independent 
trade unions met last week to work out a social pact to rescue 
nicaraguas economy 
on monday the currency was devalued for the 37th time since 
mrs chamorro was inaugurated april 25 the official exchange rate 
of the cordoba fell from 112 million cordobas to the dollar to

weekly devaluations are part of mrs chamorros effort to 
stabilize the economy her government also is attempting to 
decentralize the economy reduce the fiscal deficit and increase 
production 
those goals entail laying off thousands of public employees 
privatizing unproductive state enterprises and cutting off 
subsidies for public services 
the sandinistas havent offered any alternative economic plan to 
the one chamorros government is following

farm commodity exports are expected to drop 
next year as foreign production competes with us sales of grain 
and other products the agriculture department said monday 
the departments economic research service said a drop in corn 
exports in the fiscal year that will begin oct 1 will help lead 
the overall decline

than 275 million bushels as overseas customers replace us corn 
with competitors feed wheat the report said 
wheat prices are expected to average lower in 199091 due to

this decline it said

1485 million metric tons worth about 40 billion both up slightly 
from 198889

president bush declared monday im not going 
to be distracted by iraqs saddam husseins efforts to link the 
persian gulf crisis with the israelipalestinian dispute 
first weve got to take care of the situation that exists 
right now naked aggression of one country against the other that 
cannot be permitted to stand bush told a group of arabamerican 
leaders 
the president said that the united states simply cannot link 
the kuwaiti takeover by iraq with the palestinian issue 
the iraqi leader has suggested that one way to ease the crisis 
would be for israel to withdraw from the arab territories it has 
occupied since 1967 where many palestinians live 
the united states bush said is committed to peace in the 
region and once the gulf crisis is on its way to resolution 
wants to go forward with the peace process any ultimate 
solution he said must include recognition of israel by arab 
nations and legitimate political rights for the palestinians 
bush telling members of the audience that they understood the 
tensions in the region better than most people said to permit 
saddam hussein to link these two questions and approve of his 
aggression that way we simply cannot do it we are going to resist 
his attempts to justify what he did based on other regional 
concerns so i think these are merely on his part an effort to 
create additional pretexts so that he can stay in kuwait 
in a lively questionandanswer session bush was asked why the 
united states would not negotiate with iraq he answered with a 
description of us policy 
no negotiations bush said us policy he continued 
remains clear iraq must withdraw from kuwait completely 
immediately and without condition kuwaits legitimate government 
must be restored the security and stability of the persian gulf 
assured and american citizens abroad must be protected 
asked why the united states was depriving the children of iraq 
of food in the international trade embargo bush said that the 
iraqi regime would not permit relief organizations to send in 
supervised food shipments 
i am much less interested in feeding saddam husseins army at 
this point bush said he said he was concerned about the plight 
of women and children including asian refugees stranded in kuwait 
the state department meanwhile said at least 900 american men 
women and children remain trapped in kuwait and iraq and 93 have 
been detained by iraq authorities 
some of those detained are ill and their captivity is 
barbaric said the departments principal spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler 
iraq has said it is putting american men in strategic 
installations to deter attacks 
department officials said they had no knowledge of a claim by 
iraq that the united states rebuffed an offer to release the 
captive americans in exchange for permission for the iraqi foreign 
minister to land in new york in an iraqi plane to attend united 
nations meetings the department has refused landing permission 
saying the official could take a commercial flight 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater characterized 
saddams new threat to blow up oil fields in the middle east part 
of a daily diatribe from saddam 
we wont get into responding every day to saddams 
statements he said 
bush was grilled by the audience made up of 150 arabamerican 
business executives and others on us policy in the middle east 
despite the tough questioning he received a standing ovation at 
the end of the 20minute session 
bush spoke out forcefully about discrimination against 
arabamericans and what he called appalling acts of hatred by 
a few hatemongers 
it is simply not fair to lump the outrageous behavior of a 
dictator halfway around the world into how people are treated here 
at home he said 
bush defended americas de facto alliance with syrian president 
hafez assad whose country is officially called a sponsor of 
terrorism by the united states 
to a lebaneseamerican man who objected sharply to the 
partnership bush said out of this there could well be a new 
world order and part of this must be a peaceful resolution of the 
division of lebanon 
on saddams calls for israel to give up its occupied territory 
bush said im not going to be distracted by this 
a arabamerican car dealer from detroit told bush he had his own 
peace plan to pressure both iraq and israeli to give up occupied 
lands 
the kuwait crisis must be taken care of first bush said 
bush stayed twice as long as planned after he began taking 
questions participants were waving their hands for recognition 
even before he concluded his prepared remarks 
one man commented that a billion moslems live under tyrannical 
monarchs and asked why the united states was trying to restore the 
emir of kuwait bush said crisply the objective is to see that 
naked aggression does not pay off sir

south dakota gov george mickelson asked bush 
administration officials monday to designate wounded knee a 
national monument before the end of this year the 100th 
anniversary of the massacre there 
interior secretary manuel lujan did not indicate a position on 
the request during a meeting with mickelson but his aides were 
favorably disposed the governor said later 
what i asked lujan to do was to support the idea of the 
president by executive order creating a national monument at 
wounded knee mickelson said my purpose in being here today 
was to express the urgency of it it would be the culmination of 
a great year 
the national park service however must first study the site to 
see whether the monument designation would be suitable and 
feasible said ben moffett a park service spokesman in denver 
we wouldnt do that conduct a study until congress asked us 
to do it and provided funding for it moffett said 
mickelson who designated 1990 the year of reconciliation in 
south dakota will testify tuesday at a senate indian affairs 
committee hearing where descendants of wounded knee victims will 
ask for an apology and reparations from the government as well as a 
national monument 
mickelson said monday that he did not support legislation 
seeking the apology and compensation because he feared those issues 
would slow down the effort to get the site designated a national 
monument 
federal troops killed 300 sioux warriors women and children in 
1890 on the pine ridge reservation in southwestern south dakota in 
the last major battle between indians and the army on the northern 
plains 
mickelson who is chairman of the western governors association 
also met white house representatives and officials from the energy 
department and environmental protection agency to express concerns 
about waste disposal in western states 
the message im going to convey is that they need to 
appreciate that we in the west are willing to share our share of 
the responsibility but we have no intention of accepting waste 
from all over this nation where they have not done a good job of 
protecting their environment mickelson said

a couple whose daughter died after years of 
diet pill abuse asked a congressional panel monday to push for 
restrictions on nonprescription weight loss drugs 
she might have had a chance had these products been denied her 
as a child said anthony and diana smith of state center iowa 
noelle smith 20 died a year ago of cardiac arrest after 
struggling since she was 14 with the eating disorder anorexia 
nervosa which is an avoidance of food and bulimia which involves 
binging and purging 
she was constantly sneaking diet products into the house 
said mr smith every time we found and took from noelle a box of 
diet pills laxatives or diuretics she would go to the corner 
store and buy a new supply 
jessica mcdonald 20 of washington dc said she suffered 
from the same eating disorders as a teenager and regularly 
consumed whole boxes of nonprescription diet pills at a time 
even though i went to the drug store practically every day to 
buy pills or some other product to help me lose weight no one ever 
tried to stop me or asked what i wanted the pills for said 
mcdonald 
she said that at the very least there should be an age 
restriction to prevent young people from buying these drugs 
vivian hanson meehan president of the national association of 
anorexia nervosa and associated disorders said at least one of 10 
adolescents engage in dangerous eating disorders as they try to 
diet 
the adolescent whoreduces food amounts to starvation levels 
is playing havoc with his or her bodys viability said meehan 
children who begin dieting at an early age may delay or prevent 
menstruation because females need 18 to 22 percent of body fat for 
this purpose 
meehan also decried the availability of diet pills 
diet pills containing the drug phenylpropanolamine or ppa 
pose an additional and very serious health risk to adolescents 
she said 
the drug is in most of the numerous popular nonprescription 
diet products used by about 10 million consumers a year many 
medical authorities say it can cause high blood pressure kidney 
disease heart muscle damage heart rhythm abnormalities and 
seizures 
the smiths mcdonald and meehan were among witnesses testifying 
before the house small business subcommittee which has been 
investigating the weight loss industry 
a report from the subcommittee staff noted a university of san 
francisco study of 500 girls which showed almost half the 
9yearolds and 80 percent of those age 10 and 11 were dieting 
even though just 17 percent of the group was overweight 
our investigation found that juveniles are dieting more 
obsessively than ever and that many are suffering adverse health 
effects and even death said the staff report 
chairman ron wyden doregon has been after the federal trade 
commission and the food and drug administration to crack down on 
shady diet practices 
he said the ftc has 14 investigations under way of diet 
companies and diet programs 
but he criticized the fda for being lax on enforcement 
for almost a decade the fda has dawdled over regulations that 
would make it illegal to sell diet products containing about 100 
ineffective ingredients said wyden

the sons of julius and ethel rosenberg 
said monday their parents didnt help the soviet union develop an 
atomic bomb and dismissed nikita khrushchevs memoirs thanking 
them as totally absurd 
robert and michael meeropol who have worked for years to clear 
their parents names said they werent shaken by the remarks by 
the ousted soviet leader contained in tapes he made during seven 
years of house arrest before his death in 1971 
this stuff has been going on all the time said 47yearold 
michael meeropol a professor at a small private college here 
ill tell you what the big shock was the first shock when i was 
7 years old listening to the lone ranger when the fbi arrested my 
father after that you know shocks dont happen to us we expect 
them 
khrushchev says in the memoirs that he heard from both soviet 
leader josef stalin and vyacheslav molotov then minister of 
foreign affairs that the rosenbergs provided very significant 
help in accelerating the production of our atom bomb 
let this be a worthy tribute to the memory of those people 
he said 
my reaction to the implication of help is that its wholly 
absurd said 43yearold robert meeropol a local lawyer 
the rosenbergs who maintained their innocence were executed 
june 19 1953 for conspiracy to commit espionage their sons who 
took their adoptive parents last name have used the freedom of 
information act to force the release of hundreds of thousands of 
pages of classified documents in the case 
they said their research of their parents trial and execution 
turned up affidavits by scientists who said none of the evidence 
brought by the government amounted to substantially useful 
information about the atomic bomb 
one of the things that we have discovered both in talking to 
scientists and securing affidavits and looking through the fbi 
files is that there were no major secrets robert meeropol said 
noting that his parents were convicted on conspiracy charges rather 
than direct espionage 
we know from looking at all this that if there was any help 
and i deny that there was it was insignificant so anything like 
this where someone is reporting that significant help was given 
just doesnt make sense in terms of the record he said 
the brothers said khrushchev may have misunderstood stalin or 
stalin may have been lying to create the impression of having a 
huge network of spies they also suggested that significant 
help could be interpreted as the rosenbergs refusal to implicate 
others 
washington author michael beschloss who is working on a book 
about khrushchev said khrushchevs earlier oral histories have 
held up well but it is difficult to gauge the merit of the 
rosenberg comments because the soviet leader was old ailing and 
didnt have his records when he made them 
although this is an important piece of evidence it certainly 
is not a smoking gun he said 
we want to get all the facts out robert meeropol said i 
am convinced that when thats done that well discover that what 
khrushchev said is either wrong or untrue

a center devoted to tracing the fates of people 
held in nazi concentration camps opened here monday to handle flood 
a requests expected now that the soviet union has released records 
on 400000 prisoners 
the holocaust and war victims tracing and information center 
run by the american red cross offers hope to people still 
wondering about their loved ones 45 years after the end of world 
war ii 
the latest documents which were recovered by soviet soldiers 
when the camps were liberated at the end of the war include nearly 
70000 death certificates from the auschwitz concentration camp in 
poland also included are the names of 130000 prisoners forced to 
work in germany and 200000 names of victims in other camps 
including dachau sachsenhausen gross rosen and buchenwald 
it offers the opportunity for closure to allow people to 
finally say now i know what happened said emmy hubert 
mogilensky a 67yearoldpikesville md woman who learned that 
her parents died in a concentration camp from a message the red 
cross sent her brother in 1946 
the pain of not knowing where they were if they were murdered 
in the camp did they die in the cattle cars on the way to the 
camp it haunts you it does not let you rest mogilensky said 
she sympathized with people still searching for answers 
can you doubt the value of these 400000 records can you 
imagine after 45 years still wondering still not knowing she 
asked each one of these records could be a blessing 
millions of people mostly jews were imprisoned during adolf 
hitlers third reich and an estimated 6 million jews were killed 
western allies released concentration camp documents soon after 
the war but soviet authorities kept the records sealed despite 
repeated requests finally the soviet government began releasing 
them last year

at the international tracing service in arolsen west germany a 
branch of the central tracing agency of the international committee 
of the red cross there are 46 million documents on file on about

knew that the scope of our mission was beyond anything 
imaginable said alfred himmelrick jr a 57yearold baltimore 
businessman who visited the arolsen center while planning the 
baltimore office 
these people their children their brothers their sisters 
their cousins aunts and uncles were no longer able to give voice 
to say here i am it was then that the 13 million people on file 
became real not abstract he said 
the arolsen center has helped 18 million people find 
information about missing relatives 
people wishing to learn the fate of relatives or friends can 
contact local american red cross chapters local caseworkers will 
send the requests to the baltimore center where they will be

the justice department filed an unusual 
reverse discrimination lawsuit monday accusing the maryland 
lottery of bias against white men in 1983 when it set aside several 
top positions for women and minorities 
the civil rights suit alleged that maryland and its lottery 
agency violated title vii of the 1964 civil rights act by refusing 
to hire qualified white males for the four positions set aside for 
minorities in 1983 
the lawsuit was denounced by a state official as an unwarranted 
attack on a onetime effort by maryland to recruit more minorities 
into the lottery agency 
two black men a black woman and a white women were recruited 
in response to a maryland human relations commission 
investigation and determination that the lottery agency was not 
doing enough to meet affirmative action requirements said dennis 
sweeney deputy state attorney general 
the lawsuit states that the states governor then harry r 
hughes directed the lottery agency to set aside four seniorlevel 
positions for women or members of a racial minority 
the hiring policy was investigated by the us equal employment 
opportunity commission which referred complaints of discrimination 
to the justice department according to the complaint filed in 
federal court in baltimore 
ten white men complained to the eeoc in 1985 said justice 
department spokeswoman amy casner the eeoc referred the case to 
the justice department in 1988 she said 
the lottery agency which employs 108 people has 12 
seniorlevel positions she said 
the suit seeks an injunction barring the state of maryland from 
reserving lottery agency positions for women or members of a 
minority it also seeks compensation for white men who were the 
victims of the alleged discrimination 
sweeney said the justice department has rejected overtures to 
settle the case out of court but federal officials were insistent 
on obtaining a consent decree 
we dont see the profit in going to this archaeological dig of 
attempting to reconstruct this event in 1983 sweeney said all 
the actors are all now either dead or retired from state 
government 
we are hoping we can still talk about these issues and reason 
will prevail because quite frankly i think the federal courts 
have more important things to do he said 
justice department officials have sought back pay of less than 
15000 for two men who were not hired sweeney said 
reverse discrimination lawsuits are unusual but the justice 
department has filed them in the past when it determines that 
whites have been the victims of racial bias

a convoy of trucks loaded with food rolled 
out of amman on monday bound for baghdad with horns honking flags 
flying and hundreds of jordanians cheering the violation of the 
un embargo 
the 30 trucks hauling rice powdered milk and other foodstuffs 
rationed in iraq were decorated with red green and black 
jordanian and iraqi flags banners declared the food a gift from 
the stone children the heros of the intifadeh in palestine to the 
children of iraq 
the convoy was a small but clear violation of the un embargo 
banning shipments to iraq unless cleared by the security council 
and a symbol of the enthusiastic support iraq enjoys here 
many in the crowd were of palestinian origin like about half 
of jordans 3 million residents and had donated food and money 
and brought their children to the late afternoon rally 
posters showing iraqi president saddam hussein being kissed by a 
brownhaired boy while hugging a wideeyed girl were among the 
dozens of prosaddam antiamerican signs banners and leaflets in 
the crowd 
we are for any arab child and any arab regime which is against 
the americans were with him because hes against the united 
states thats all said mona bitar who brought her five 
daughters to the rally 
i am teaching my children that arabs should be unified 
mrs bitar said that on a daughters birthday a week ago she 
asked all the children to bring a bag of rice for the children of 
iraq instead of a present they all complied 
outspoken popular support for saddam in jordan whose king 
hussein has been a us ally has mystified and infuriated the 
united states but here across the jordan river from the west 
bank it seems perfectly logical 
palestinians see saddam as the only man standing up 
unequivocally for their cause which they feel has been ignored by 
the rest of the world 
they are angered by the united states insisting on un 
resolutions demanding iraq withdraw from kuwait while failing to 
insist that israel end its occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip and give up its claim to jerusalem as required under older 
un resolutions 
i think saddam hussein is a hero in a way he is an arab 
leader fighting for arab rights said a woman in the crowd who 
declined to give her name 
one popular poster carried by member of the crowd depicted the 
troika of saddam king hussein and yasser arafat chief of the 
palestine liberation organization 
the poster speaks for itself said the father of 8yearold 
mutaz khalil who let go of one corner of the poster pulled on his 
fathers pant leg and said something softly in arabic 
hes saying hes against the jews the father explained 
of course he is hes palestinian 
the palestinians see american support of israel as the reason 
for their stateless status and misery 
taxi driver mortagi farhan watching the rally from the roadside 
monday said he sided with the activists and the intefadeh 
uprising 
my uncle was killed by israelis two friends were killed in 
israel and six cousins are in jail saddam is now the no 1 leader 
standing up for the arab cause we will support him to the end 
many jordanians privately say they do not approve of iraqs aug 
2 invasion of kuwait but they worry about the westernled military 
buildup in the persian gulf

an illegal protestant 
paramilitary group said monday it had killed the wrong man a day 
earlier in a pub shooting 
the ulster freedom fighters apologized to the family of 
48yearold construction worker william allister saying they had 
intended to kill a man they believe is a police informer 
a friend of allisters who was injured in the shooting in 
lisburn southwest of belfast was also not the intended target of 
the group the man was in critical condition in a lisburn hospital 
the shooting occurred sunday evening when at least one gunman 
burst into the county down arms singled out the two men and opened 
fire on them police said 
hours earlier masked men shot and killed colin mccullough a 
22yearold parttime soldier parked in a car with his girlfriend 
at lough neagh near lurgan about 25 miles southwest of belfast 
the royal ulster constabulary said 
police said the woman was not hurt 
suspicion fell on the irish republican army which has targeted 
the security forces in its fight to end british rule in northern 
ireland and unite the mainly protestant province with the 
overwhelmingly roman catholic irish republic 
the soldier was the seventh member of the locally recruited 
ulster defense regiment to die in northern ireland this year he 
and the pub patron were the 41st and 42nd victims of political and 
sectarian strife in the province this year

an american express co executive orchestrated a 
smear campaign against a swiss banker at odds with the financial 
services giant the wall street journal reported monday 
harry l freeman then an executive vice president with close 
ties to company chairman james d robinson iii approved the hiring 
of a private detective and a public relations executive who 
investigated swiss banker edmond j safra and spread rumors about 
him the journal said 
company officials privately blamed the incident on a handful 
of unnamed lowlevel employees the newspaper said but a 
lengthy investigation by this newspaper reveals evidence suggesting 
the effort to smear mr safra was in fact overseen from mr 
freemans office only steps away from mr robinsons 
false news stories about safra began to surface in early 1988 
linking him to drug dealers money laundering and the mafia the 
journal said 
the newspaper said there was no concrete evidence that robinson 
knew of the campaign against safra although the american express 
chairman had regular contact with one of freemans operatives 
susan cantor 
last year american express publicly apologized to safra 
admitting that people acting on its behalf had tried to discredit 
him american express paid 8 million to charities of safras 
choice to make amends 
freeman later retired from the company accepting responsibility 
for mistakes made on my watch 
larry armour an american express spokesman said monday its 
senseless to respond to old news no matter how colorfully someone 
chooses to repackage it 
the journal said american express and safra began to fall out 
soon after robinson decided in 1983 to buy safras genevabased 
trade development bank and combine it with american express bank 
the styles of the two men differed sharply and in 1984 safra 
resigned from the company the split between safra and robinson 
deepened during negotiations on a settlement package and matters 
grew worse as american express bank officials began to suspect that 
safra who was planning to begin another swiss bank in 1988 was 
hiring away american express employees the journal said 
robert smith former chairman of american express bank told the 
journal he told robinson he had hired detectives to follow the 
former american express workers 
smith said he became obsessed with stopping safra the newspaper 
said his anger spread to other company officials especially 
freeman it said 
the company tried in vain to block safras attempt to get a new 
banking license in switzerland in 1987 the newspaper said 
the next year after safra opened his new bank reports appeared 
in newspapers in europe and south america linking safra to the 
mafia nowdeposed panamanian dictator manuel noriega south 
american drug traffickers the cia and the irancontra scandal 
during the course of a libel suit safra filed against a french 
newspaper minute a lawyer for safra found that a life magazine 
article about the mafia had been faxed to minute from american 
express headquarters in new york the journal said 
safras investigators eventually pegged antonio greco an 
elusive businessman with homes in spain and new york city as the 
source of the articles 
greco was an investigator working for american express the 
journal said he also had an arrest record in the united states and 
italy going back to 1962 and had been convicted on charges 
including theft conspiracy and handling stolen goods the 
newspaper said 
the journal said grecos link at american express was susan 
cantor now a senior vice president at american express bank and 
before that an employee in the american express public relations 
office working under harry freeman the journal said 
freeman was convinced that safra wanted to destroy american 
express bank and had been collecting rumors about him the journal 
said 
at first freeman used ms cantor a former abc news employee 
to gather information on safra but her task evolved to spreading 
rumors and negative news stories about him the newspaper said 
in a statement to the journal ms cantor said she never 
intended or sought to disseminate false information concerning 
edmond safra to anyone and i never instructed asked or engaged 
anyone to spread such information 
the journal said it interviewed dozens of people for the story 
including private detectives and 15 current and former american 
express executives

media banned from his deposition in a 50 million civil suit filed 
by victim darrell cabey 
ronald kuby the paralyzed plaintiffs attorney said goetz had 
undermined his case on the stand while goetz said the case could 
be dismissed later this week 
mr goetz made it clear he intended to destroy darrell cabey 
to end his life if anything bernie goetz convicted himself with 
his own mouth said kuby 
but goetz when the threehour hearing was over said the key to 
his testimony was that he fired three times at cabey on dec 22 
1984 why did he shoot i was being mugged goetz told 
reporters 
the subway gunman wouldnt go any further in describing his 
appearance but kuby said goetz claims his first shot missed cabey 
now 22 and the second one struck the plaintiff 
when goetz then told cabey you dont look so bad heres 
another and fired again at the youth a third time there was no 
bullet in the chamber kuby said that doesnt matter because it 
clearly shows intent to injure 
the softspoken goetz saw things differently goetz said he 
intends to move for a dismissal of the case on wednesday after he 
questions cabey in the same state courtroom 
i believe darrell cabey is going to say he doesnt remember 
why he was shot or what happened on that subway darrell cabey is 
going to pretend hes a mental vegetable everybody knows darrell 
cabey is faking said goetz 
goetz 42 was acquitted of attempted murder in the shooting but 
convicted of a weapons possession charge he never took the stand 
at his trial he served 8 months in prison on his conviction 
goetz was subsequently sued for 50 million by cabey who also 
reportedly suffered brain damage due to the shooting the three 
other teens goetz shot all recovered

portauprince haiti ap the likelihood of elections in 
haiti this year increased monday when three major political parties 
agreed to participate in voting organized by the countrys current 
administration 
bolstered by the support of the parties including the haitian 
communist party and by an infusion of foreign aid the 
independent electoral council was expected to hold the election in 
middecember 
louis dejoie jr chief of the moderate national industrial and 
agricultural party said we are going to launch our election 
campaign the armed forces have taken steps which should give 
voters confidence in safe elections 
the council earlier postponed elections planned for nov 4 
because of lack of money also many politicians were refusing to 
participate 
they claimed that interim president ertha pascaltrouillot had 
done little to investigate political murders reform the 
notoriously corrupt and brutal military or resolve haitis grave 
economic problems 
we still insist on minimum security conditions and the arrest 
and trial of criminal supporters of dictatorship said 
jeanclaude bajeux of the socialist congress of democratic 
movements if the voters are threatened we will withdraw from 
the race but to refuse to compete while mrs pascaltrouillot is 
in office is political suicide 
communist leader rene theodore said that while he opposes mrs 
pascaltrouillot politicians here are handicapped by the lack of 
an alternative to her power which is acceptable to all 
the three parties are the largest among seven in the 12party 
unity assembly which last month demanded that mrs 
pascaltrouillot resign the assembly appointed her president in 
march 
a council of state set up to share power with mrs 
pascaltrouillot accused her of being an obstacle to credible 
elections council members said she made decisions without 
consulting them and mismanaged the economy 
on saturday former president jimmy carter said during a visit 
that the international community believed the pascaltrouillot 
administration could hold fair elections the united states and 
canada recently sent money to the electoral council 
haitis last attempt to hold democratic elections collapsed on 
nov 29 1987 when thugs supported by the army shot and hacked to 
death at least 34 voters at polling stations 
mrs pascaltrouillot heads the fifth government since dictator 
jeanclaude duvalier fled in 1986 ending a 29year family 
dictatorship

people who regularly eat fish taken from 
streams near pulp and paper mills that discharge dioxin run a 
increased risk of developing cancer the environmental protection 
agency said monday 
the epa made public the results of a study showing that dioxin 
concentrations in fish downstream from 19 such mills may be high 
enough to pose an increased cancer risk greater than one in 
10000 to average consumers of fish caught there 
the estimated cancer risk is potentially higher for avid 
sports fishermen and subsistence level fishermen because their 
consumption of fish is generally higher than that of average 
consumers the epa said 
the epa said its risk estimates are based on the consumption of 
fish such as catfish bass suckers and squaw fish that spend 
their entire lives near a paper mill and accumulate greater 
concentrations of dioxin in their tissues 
the risk estimates do not apply to migratory fish such as 
salmon that spend only a short portion of their lives in the 
contaminated waters 
the onein10000 estimate is an upper bound any risk if 
present could be lower the agency generally tries to act against 
risks this large and treats smaller risks with less concern 
the average risk in the united states of dying of cancer from 
any source is about one in five 
the cancer risk for fish taken from waters below the 
international paper co mill at georgetown sc could be as high 
as one in 50 the epa said 
there are 104 paper mills operated by 38 companies that produce 
paper bleached with chlorine compounds and that discharge dioxin 
dioxin a byproduct of the bleaching process is a powerful 
cause of cancer and birth defects in laboratory animals the epa 
lists it as a probable cause of cancer in humans but there has 
been no proof it actually causes human cancers 
the epa said it is issuing waste water discharge permits over 
the next two years to 66 mills to limit dioxin discharges many of 
the permits will require mills to reduce the use of chlorine and 
the 66 mills will have to comply no later than june 1993 
the environmental agency said it is also developing national 
guidelines and standards to limit dioxin contamination from the 
manufacture of bleached paper products and will seek cooperation 
from industry and the states for further pollution reduction 
initiatives 
it said that the new standards will likely focus on changes in 
the bleaching process to prevent the formation of dioxin in sludge 
and pulp as well as waste water 
many of the 104 mills have already reduced dioxin discharges 
some of them significantly the epa said 
here are the mills posing a maximum likely risk of greater than 
one in 10000 after each mill is the risk estimate and whether an 
advisory against eating fish from the stream has been issued

by the 1994 model year joining the big three us automakers in 
announcing plans to make the safety devices standard equipment the 
next few years 
currently chrysler corp equips all of its usmade cars with 
driverside air bags and general motors corp and ford motor corp 
have announced they will follow suit by the middle of the decade 
honda which now puts automatic seat belts on its cars 
announced monday it will install driver and passengerside 
airbags nobuhiko kawamoto new president of honda motor corp

the senate narrowly rejected a proposal monday 
night to aid autoworkers laid off in any required shift by 
automakers to highermileage cars 
in debate on a bill to require cars to average 40 miles per 
gallon the senate voted 4946 to reject an amendment by sen paul 
simon dill that would have provided special unemployment 
assistance for those workers 
a vote on whether to close off debate on the bill was scheduled 
for tuesday 
the passage of this amendment will doom this bill declared 
sen slade gorton rwash a cosponsor 
later the senate agreed 5540 to a include in the legislation 
new incentives for automakers to produce vehicles that can run on 
alternative fuels such as methanol ethanol or natural gas the 
measure would allow manufacturers to claim credits against fuel 
efficiency requirements if they produce such vehicles 
similar fuel economy legislation has been introduced in the 
house but has yet to emerge from committee 
in earlier debate on the legislation opponents argued that the 
higher fuel economy requirements would be a death blow to the 
midsize family sedan and force automakers to produce only small 
cars 
sen richard bryan dnev chief sponsor of the legislation 
disputed such claims arguing higher fuel efficiency can be 
achieved without sacrificing the sixpassenger automobile 
it means smaller cars it means less safe cars declared 
sen donald riegle dmich who has led efforts to block 
consideration of the measure 
the legislations supporters maintained that manufacturers have 
shown in the past that they can come up with technologies to 
improve fuel efficiency greatly and still provide customers with a 
broad range of vehicle models 
in aiming to reduce the nations dependence on foreign oil the 
bill would would require cars to achieve on a fleet average 35 mpg 
by 1995 and 40 mpg by 2001 he said that would eventually save 28 
million barrels of oil daily 
the automakers have said they cant meet those goals without 
making cars dramatically smaller and stopping production of midsize 
and large vehicles 
bryan read statements by auto industry executives in the early 
1970s predicting the demise of the family sedan as a result of fuel 
efficiency requirements then under consideration 
that just didnt happen the sixpassenger vehicle is here 
just as it was before said bryan

jordanian and yemeni envoys 
expelled from saudi arabia this week were monitored photographing 
strategic oil military and government installations and later 
meeting with iraqi diplomats diplomatic sources said monday 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said saudi 
officials believed an attempted breakin at the kingdoms largest 
oil company two weeks ago was part of the alleged espionage 
campaign for which the riyadh government expelled most iraqi 
yemeni and jordanian diplomats 
some of the expelled diplomats had been seen earlier in the area 
of the oil company saudi aramco and also at another major saudi 
oil field and installation at safaniya the sources said 
iraqi president saddam hussein has threatened to destroy middle 
east oil fields in any war with us and other forces deployed to 
the region following the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
aramco officials confirmed that an outside fence at its complex 
was cut two weeks ago by unidentified intruders who fled when a 
security guard turned a light on them these officials who also 
spoke on the condition of anonymity said an additional security 
fence closer to the tanks never was breached 
a company spokesman did not immediately return telephone calls 
seeking additional information 
an internal aramco memo written several days after the 
fencecutting refers to the incident as terrorist and says 
aramco compound security has been improved and access to the 
compound restricted 
the diplomatic sources said they were reluctant to discuss the 
aramco incident in detail because the government did not want to 
raise concern among american and other expatriate workers most of 
those workers sent their families home after the iraqi invasion of 
kuwait 
saudi arabia ordered the diplomats expelled saturday saying 
they had engaged in activities jeopardizing the peace and 
security of the kingdom 
a saudi foreign ministry statement said complaints were made to 
the three governments about the blatant and flagrant 
infringements but the diplomats did not halt their improper 
activities 
diplomatic sources said the order affected 14 iraqis 56 yemenis 
and 10 jordanian envoys earlier saudi arabia said it was ending 
its practice of allowing unrestricted entry to the kingdom from 
neighboring yemen 
the expulsions were also seen as a sign of saudi displeasure 
with yemen and jordans failure to take sides against saddam 
on monday diplomatic sources said numerous palestinians and 
jordanians also have been told to leave the kingdom in the seven 
weeks since the invasion of kuwait 
the sources said these moves were for security reasons but 
refused to be more specific and said they could not provide exact 
numbers 
the sources said the jordanian and yemeni diplomats were placed 
under strict surveillance immediately following the aug 2 iraqi 
invasion of kuwait saudi arabia had immediately restricted the 
movements of iraqi envoys to riyadh 
it was obvious they would need help if they wanted to engage 
in espionage one source said 
this source and another diplomatic official familiar with the 
situation said saudi internal security monitored a sudden flurry of 
unusual activity by yemeni and jordanian diplomats including long 
drives to areas of the eastern province in which they had no 
business 
the eastern province is home to aramco safaniya other major 
oil installations and to saudi military bases and camps now being 
used by american british and other foreign troops here for the 
multinational defense effort 
one source who reported receiving a briefing on the activities 
from saudi military officials said the yemenis and jordanians were 
monitored taking photographs of the strategic facilities in the 
eastern province and also of government buildings in riyadh 
the first rule of terrorism is to stake out the targets one 
of the sources said still this official said the saudi government 
had no concrete evidence linking the suspicious activity to the 
attempted breakin at aramco 
two sources said saudi authorities monitored meetings between 
the jordanians yemenis and iraqi diplomats who are restricted to 
riyadh 
security in the eastern province area has been increased with 
armed patrols driving along highways and coastal roads throghout 
the night 
saudi officials said the increased security is partly 
attributable to the recent suspicions about the diplomats 
movements but also because of fears iraqsponsored terrorists might 
have slipped into saudi arabia when iraq opened the kuwaiti border 
for several days last week

five of eight voter initiatives including 
one that would have allowed tax credits at parochial schools are 
ineligible for the november election a judge ruled monday 
three other statewide measures on the nov 6 general election 
ballot could be disqualified under the ruling by marion county 
circuit judge richard barber among them is a measure which if 
approved would outlaw most abortions in the state 
barber said the five initiatives do not qualify because they 
wont be accompanied by financial impact statements as required by 
state law the statements estimating each measures fiscal impact 
on the state were earlier declared invalid because they werent 
certified by deadline 
both the state and a group backing the education measure said 
they would appeal barbers decision to the state court of appeals 
which could send the case to the oregon supreme court without 
ruling 
the education measure would allow tax credits of up to 2500 a 
year each for pupils at private schools including churchsupported 
schools and for children taught at home 
that measure which drew the interest of educators across the 
country also would have allowed parents to send their children 
across district lines to any public school 
it would be a travesty and an injustice if the public werent 
allowed to vote on a measure because state officials didnt do 
their job said steve buckstein spokesman for oregonians for 
educational choice 
the other measures affected by mondays ruling would limit 
property taxes to 15 percent of value shut down the trojan 
nuclear plant about 40 miles northwest of portland until waste 
disposal requirements are met ban some nonrecyclable packaging 
and establish a program to put able welfare applicants to work 
barbers ruling strikes at the heart of the initiative 
process secretary of state barbara roberts said in announcing 
the states plan to appeal it means that a legal technicaltiy 
can take away a constitutional right she said 
about 84000 registered voters signed petitions to get the 
educational initiative on the ballot while the measure on the 
nuclear plant required about 63000 signatures 
because of printing deadlines barber said the five measures 
could stay on the ballot but that votes for or against them would 
not be counted 
barbers decision was an outgrowth of earlier marion county 
circuit court rulings that the fiscal statements were invalid 
state law specifies that the secretary of state state treasurer 
and the directors of the executive and revenue departments certify 
the fiscal impact statements 
state elections director jack graham said those officials were 
polled on the aug 8 deadline and that three of four agreed to the 
statements but the statements werent signed until after the 
deadline 
if the ruling stands on appeal three more measures lacking 
fiscal impact statements also would have to be disqualified he 
said 
those measures would outlaw most abortions require parental 
notice of abortions involving minors and change taxation of some 
public employee pensions 
if all eight are disqualified three measures would be left on 
the ballot two legislative housekeeping measures and one that 
would require seat belt use they didnt require financial impact 
statements

manufacturers hanover said monday 
it may not have enough cash and debt papers in time to take over 
argentinas state telephone company by the oct 8 deadline 
there are some difficulties in complying with the 
timeframe said pablo leclerc a spokesman for a consortium 
financed by the us bank 
however leclerc denied published reports the group is backing 
out of the entel phone company deal or cannot meet the deadline 
the consortium is still planning to take over the operation of 
the north zone he told radio mitre 
on june 28 the consortium that includes bell atlantic corp of 
philadelphia was awarded 60 percent of the northern half of entel 
in return for 100 million cash 22 billion in debt papers and 
178 million in notes payable over six years 
another consortium that includes citibank and spains national 
communications company telefonica was awarded the southern half for 
114 million in cash 27 billion in debt papers and 202 million 
in notes 
each sector under the agreement gets half of the buenos aires 
area and the northern or southern half of the country 
total value of the deal to provide telephone service in this 
country of 32 million residents is about 134 billion 
this is the largest privatization project going on anywhere in 
the world it shouldnt come as a shock that there are problems 
said david frost bell atlantics operations manager in argentina 
it is clear that the government wants us to move as quickly as 
possible in wrapping up the various loose ends frost said but 
it is also clear to us that bell atlantic is the company the 
government wants to manage operations in the north 
frost declined to comment on how close manufacturers hanover and 
its argentine partners are to meeting the down payment and debt 
titles 
the key date is oct 8 he said and were doing everything we 
can to meet that deadline 
if manufacturers hanover fails to make the deadline another 
consortium that includes jp morgan and co and the italian 
telecommunications company stet reportedly would step in the 
consortium was runnerup to manufacturers hanover in june 28 
bidding 
president carlos menem said monday that the oct 8 date is 
unmovable and if manufacturers hanover fails to fulfill its 
obligations the government will award the bid to stet according 
to the private news agency diarios y noticias 
the state carrier aerolineas argentinas also is supposed to be 
formally taken over on oct 8 by a consortium that includes the 
spanish national carrier iberia and the argentine airline cielos 
del sur 
that sale too has come close close to stalling for lack of 
funds the consortium apparently intended to buy the airline with 
funds raised by selling planes and leasing them back the 
government insists the buyers use more of their own capital

widows elderly parents and friends 
wept or bowed their heads on monday in remembrance of the 157 north 
americans who died fighting in the israeli army 
the president of the association of americans and canadians in 
israel sherwin pomrantz said the annual ceremony is held to point 
up the contribution the 80000member community of north american 
jews has made here 
it is an opportunity for us to stop and say these are people 
who came here and really gave their last full measure of devotion 
as north americans to israel pomerantz said 
two names of fallen americans were added to the bronze plaque 
this year 
one zeev traum 40 moved to israel from the bronx borough of 
new york city following the 1967 middle east war 
he was serving in the reserves last november when arab 
guerrillas ambushed his jeep in the occupied gaza strip fire 
killing him and another soldier 
traums heart was later transplanted into a palestinian man in 
arab east jerusalem 
for our generation it was a choice between fighting in a 
tragic and badly motivated war in vietnam or coming to israel to 
your own country to your own people said neil hassid 42 a 
close friend and army buddy of traums 
that kind of choice should have been obvious to all of us it 
was to me and it was to zeev 
al liebman the fatherinlaw of joe berniker 35 the second 
fallen soldier lighted the memorial torch on this windswept 
mountaintop forest of young cedars about 15 miles west of 
jerusalem 
berniker 35 moved to israel from new orleans in 1974 and was a 
member of a communal farm near israels border with lebanon 
berniker was also serving in the reserves when a stray artillery 
shell killed him and and four other soldiers last july during a 
training exercise 
col raanan gissin praised the north american contribution and 
lauded their service to the only jewish army in the world 
i think there is a sense and a feeling that this is their 
army it is not just the army of the united states but the army of 
the jewish people he said 
for israelis military service is the one bonding experience 
they will most likely share but for american immigrants who have 
grown up without the draft service can be a disconcertingly quick 
access to the network that makes one fully israeli 
rena genn lost her husband eli solomon in the 1973 yom kippur 
war after emigrating from new york city 
she said it takes time to become part of this country until 
one day it is not them but us 
unfortunately the event that made me 100 percent part of it 
all was a knock on the door

last november nhan trong do a page designer for the magazine 
was found shot to death outside his home in seven corners va no 
arrest has been made in that case

be related to tien phongs staunchly anticommunist articles 
the magazine was founded in saigon in 1955 and moved to the 
united states in 1975 after the defeat of south vietnam by north 
vietnam it has become controversial among its readers because of 
its criticism of prominent community leaders and of actions by

the killing torture and arbitrary imprisonment of the worlds 
children 
as world leaders prepared for this weekends world summit for 
children the londonbased human rights organization described 
violations in 19 countries including iraq israel south africa and 
the united states 
of all the victims of human rights violations children are 
among the least able to stand up for their rights governments must 
therefore be particularly vigilant in protecting those rights 
amnesty said in an appeal 
unicef the united nations childrens fund is organizing the 
summit that will discuss ways of improving the lot of millions of 
children whose lives are threatened by poverty disease or 
malnutrition 
at least 60 heads of state including president bush and british 
prime minister margaret thatcher will meet sept 2930 at the 
united nations headquarters in new york 
amnesty said children are used as pawns to get their parents to 
turn themselves in or to make confessions and often are victims of 
political and military unrest 
all too often children are victimized simply because of where 
they live or who their parents are sometimes their age alone makes 
them targets for abuse it said 
in iraq it said hundreds of children had disappeared or been 
tortured in iraq too hundreds more children have died in 
chemical weapons attacks on kurdish communities which claimed the 
lives of thousands of people amnesty said 
in israel it said palestinian children have been victims of 
rights violations virtually daily since the beginning of the 
intefadeh the palestinian uprising 
of the more than 600 people shot dead by security forces 153 
have been children amnesty said in an alarmingly high number of 
incidents the children did not appear to have been involved in any 
lifethreatening activity it added 
in liberia amnesty said children have been among the thousands 
of civilians arbitrarily killed or mutilated by government forces 
and their armed opponents 
during the states of emergency in south africa from 198587 it 
said an estimated 10000 children were detained without charge or 
trial some for more than a year 
amnesty said children are often deliberately targeted for rights 
violations because they are seen as a social or political threat 
in brazil and guatemala where the number of street children 
has grown dramatically in recent years they are tortured and 
extrajudicially executed by police often in the name of 
cleaning up the streets amnesty said 
in china it said children were among more than 1000 people 
killed when troops fired on prodemocracy demonstrators in beijing 
in june 1989 
the international rights group said the united states was one of 
seven countries that has reportedly executed minors the past 10 
years 
the united states has 35 prisoners on death row who were under 
18 when they committed their crime one such prisoner dalton 
prejean was executed this year amnesty said 
amnesty also gave examples of violations in albania argentina 
bolivia chad el salvador mauritania burma nigeria peru

president bush said monday that south africas 
campaign to abolish white supremacist rule is irreversible and 
assured president fw de klerk that he would oppose new conditions 
for lifting economic sanctions 
these conditions are clearcut and are not open to 
reinterpretation and i do not believe in moving the goalposts 
bush said referring to requirements south africa must fulfill 
before the sanctions will be suspended the sanctions were imposed 
in 1986 over then president reagans veto 
bush also said all political groups in south africa have a 
special responsibility to support the process of peaceful 
transition 
de klerk the first south african leader to visit the united 
states since 1945 assured bush that the process of reform is 
irreversible and bush echoed that sentiment 
we will not turn back de klerk said 
the leaders met at the white house for two hours first in the 
oval office and again over lunch the meeting was a showcase of 
us political support for de klerks efforts to guide south africa 
toward a postapartheid democratic system 
later foreign minister pik botha said bushs characterization 
of the dismantling of apartheid as irreversible should help 
persuade european governments to lift sanctions 
he said he understood the bush administration would have 
difficulty in changing sanctions written into law by congress 
wre are aware of the sensitivities constraining the us 
administration and we are not here to as the us to do anything 
about it at this stage botha said 
more than 100 antiapartheid demonstrators marched outside the 
white house during the visit 
bush is an accomplice to a colossal public relations fraud 
which attempts to portray fw de klerk as a moderate reformer 
said randall robinson head of transafrica a private 
antiapartheid group 
robinson said de klerks trip sends a false and dangerous 
message that south africa is on its way to change 
bush praised de klerk at a farewell ceremony in front of the 
sundrenched south lawn 
clearly the time has come to encourage and assist the 
emerging new south africa bush said behind the leaders a black 
marine held the flag of south africa a white marine held the 
american flag 
but bush said that despite the dramatic progress that we 
salute here today south africa hasnt moved far enough to meet 
the conditions for removing economic sanctions 
south africa has not released all political prisoners and has 
not lifted the state of emergency in the natal province further 
it has not repealed a population registration act that requires 
citizens to be classified by race a key part of the apartheid 
system 
on the other hand bush said the move away from apartheid 
toward a new political reality is indeed irreversible and much has 
already happened 
bushs statement goes beyond the assessment of most european 
leaders 
i dont think its that far ahead i imagine that by the 
end of the year they european leaders will have reached that 
conclusion assistant secretary of state herman cohen said at 
briefing for reporters 
cohen said the united states accepts the conclusion that south 
africa wont repeal the population registration measure until 
apartheid is totally dismantled 
bush he said could act to suspend or modify sanctions if all 
other conditions are met 
bush cited the release from prison of african national congress 
leader nelson mandela the removal of outlaw status for the african 
national congress plans to release remaining political prisoners 
and removal of media restraints as improvements 
who among us only a year ago would have anticipated these 
remarkable developments bush asked 
de klerk promised bush his government would replace its white 
supremacist system with a new structure with a vote of equal 
value to all south africans 
bush and de klerk both noted that the process of reform has been 
plagued by a recent upsurge in blackagainstblack violence in 
south african townships the death toll is estimated at about 750 
bush urged south african blacks to cooperate during the period 
of transition 
the government has a special responsibility to maintain 
order bush said but all political parties and groups have a 
special responsibility to support the process of peaceful 
transition 
mandela has sought to blame proapartheid security elements of 
the police and military for recent violence a possibility south 
african officials dont dismiss 
in his remarks de klerk praised bush for his leadership in the 
persian gulf crisis and said south africa would support him

jesse jackson made a quick oneday trip monday 
to the montreal area to gather material for a u s tv report on the 
mohawk land dispute crisis at oka and compared the standoff in 
quebec to kuwait 
military occupation is military occupation he said 
he was referring to canadian army control in kahnesatake that 
includes limiting news media activities and allowing into a nearby 
drug and alcohol treatment center where the army has penned in 
about 50 indians only as much food and supplies as deemed 
necessary 
jackson a civil rights activist and politician mingled with 
locals at the kahnesatake food bank but was kept from talking to 
the natives at the treatment center there 
maj john paul macdonald of the canadian forces said jackson was 
treated like any other journalist and refused entry to the 
compound which has been sealed to reporters for two weeks 
jackson complained when the free press is cut off and denied 
access to all parties involved then it undercuts the character of 
democracy both sides here are interested in facesaving honor and 
dignity but somehow facesaving has to give way to lifesaving 
and communications must be resumed 
the black activist wore a trenchcoat in the cold rainy weather 
and carried a notepad but spent much of his time shaking hands 
kissing babies and signing autographs 
he was accompanied by grand chief joe norton of the kahnawake 
mohawk reserve and a dozen other people including a production 
crew from his syndicated television show in the united states 
however he left many canadians confused as to just what he hoped 
to accomplish in the confrontation between mohawks and authorities 
jackson visited the food bank in the mohawk community after 
being turned back at the treatment center he refused to say he was 
in the montreal area in any negotiating capacity but suggested his 
experience might be a factor in facilitating an end to this 
impasse 
the dispute arose over plans by oka community 18 miles west of 
montreal to expand a golf course onto land the mohawks claim as 
ancestral mohawks and police fought a gun battle on july 11 when 
police tried to tear down an indian barricade an officer was 
killed but blame in the death has not been fixed 
jacksons credentials include a trip to syria in 1984 where he 
persuaded president hafez assad to release an american navy pilot 
who had been shot down by the syrian air force 
the american black leader also went to premier robert bourassas 
office however the premier wasnt there and jackson ended up 
speaking to his chief of staff john parisella and native affairs 
minister john ciaccia

a news story raising questions about clinical 
trials that led to widespread use of the antiaids drugs azt 
touched off a flap here monday with one activist calling for a 
federal probe 
the miami heralds tropic magazine published a story sunday on 
the role of dr margaret fischl a prominent researcher who helps 
run the university of miami aids program in the 1987 study that 
brought azt to prominence 
the article quoted some researchers as criticizing the methods 
used in the study questioning the accuracy of the figures and 
suggesting that azts effectiveness was overrated by the doctor 
we demand a suspension of her official activities and a 
complete investigation of her and her involvement with burroughs 
wellcome activist bob kunst director of miamibased cure aids 
now said monday this is just a monstrous conspiracy openly 
fraudulently misleading the public on azt 
kunst noted ms fischl sits on the 10member aids clinical 
trials group which directs the governments 100 million research 
effort and said he has written congress asking for an 
investigation 
he said his group along with many others aidsvictim advocates 
has not promoted azt use for several years saying the benefits 
appear to disappear quickly and that side effects are deadly 
ms fischl has connections with the british company making azt 
burroughs wellcome which chose her to run the clinical trials 
here the newspaper said 
ms fischl denied any impropriety in the study or her relations 
with burroughs wellcome 
i do not own stock in pharmaceutical companies she said 
i have never gotten a kickback from burroughs wellcome if 
thats the terminology 
the university of miamirun jackson memorial hospital where the 
trials were run did not immediately respond to the article monday 
dr bernard fogel dean of the um medical school strongly 
defended ms fischl saying she gets a flat 120000 salary through 
the school and receives no direct payments from burroughs 
wellcome 
ms fischl was principal author of first research published on 
azt and now promotes the drugs in television spots and literature 
distrubuted to physicians by burroughs wellcome the article said 
the researcher whose work attracts 10 million in government and 
private grants for the university said she isnt compensated for 
the endorsements 
the herald tropic story detailed what it said were numerous 
questions about the 1987 study which ms fischl interrupted after 
saying the initial results were so striking that it would have been 
immoral to continue giving placebos to half the subjects much of 
the criticism has been aired previously at scientific conferences 
the initial positive results for azt may have been the result of 
blood transfusions given along with the drug dr joseph sonnabend 
said in the article the south african researcher who was among the 
first to study aids 
ellen cooper medical researcher with the us food and drug 
administration who analyzed fischls azt study in 1987 expressed 
concern that subjects were being treated with numerous other drugs 
that would violate normal scientific procedures and cloud the 
conclusions she said 
the article said the final death toll of patients using azt was 
far higher than in the initial announcements an ongoing veterans 
administration study and a european study published in science 
magazine have failed to confirm the fischl studys results the 
newspaper said 
the newspaper said ms fischl claimed that the study was a 
doubleblind meaning neither the patients nor those giving the 
drug knew who was receiving azt but researchers have now 
acknowledged that they knew which patients received azt because 
lab blood tests clearly showed the difference and the drug which 
causes anemia required that recipients undergo transfusions the 
herald said

a republican at a conference last week attended by 20 black

in delivering the endorsement for campbell the mayors spurned 
state sen theo mitchell who is black 
mitchell said he wasnt surprised campbell received the 
endorsements and chalked it up to practical politics 
campbell is the man who has the power this is the man who has 
doled out grants this is the man who put some money in some of the 
hands of some of the mayors to address their problems mitchell 
said 
mayor joe montgomery of atlantic beach echoed mitchells 
assessment saying he supported campbell because of what hes 
done and what he can do hes helped our towns and based on his

archibishop desmond tutu said monday he 
hoped president bush would encourage south african president f w 
de klerk to get on with the business of negotiating an end to 
white rule 
i think they really ought to get into the negotiating mode 
quickly because thats the only way in which results will happen 
which will then lead to the lifting of sanctions the south 
african prelate said after receiving an honorary degree from the 
university of missourikansas city 
de klerk the first south african leader to visit the united 
states since 1945 met with bush monday in washington 
tutu praised de klerks reforms as steps toward dismantling 
south africas apartheid a system of racial separation under which 
the countrys black majority is ruled by the white minority 
it is important that some recognition be given for the things 
he has done and recognition for his courage said tutu who won 
the nobel peace prize in 1984 for his work against his countrys 
system of racial separation 
however tutu said it was too early to ease us economic 
sanctions against south africa the sanctions helped push de klerk 
toward change he said 
in washington monday bush said that despite dramatic progress 
south africa has not met conditions for ending the sanctions 
among de klerks reforms was the legalization of the african 
national congress and other antiapartheid groups in february anc 
leader nelson mandela was freed after more than 27 years in prison

telling a group of islamic theologians saddam also insisted his 
armies would never pull back 
kuwait belongs to iraq and we will never give it up even if we 
have to fight over it for a thousand years he said

hurting other countries by depriving them of trade with baghdad

no specifics on how much money would be forthcoming but us 
officials have said egypt jordan and turkey alone would need up to

jordans capital bound for baghdad with horns honking and flags 
flying hundreds of jordanians cheered the violation of the un 
embargo that bans shipments to iraq unless cleared by the security

jordan

potential jurors and denied a defense request to increase the 
number of preemptory challenges

french president francois mitterrand on 
monday denounced iraq as a warlike state and warned baghdad the 
international community would not retreat from its demand that the 
iraqis give up kuwait 
he and other speakers set the stage for a security council vote 
tuesday afternoon on extending trade sanctions against iraq to 
include an air embargo 
at the same time however mitterrand also held out an olive 
branch 
he said if iraq were to withdraw its troops and free the 
hostages everything might be possible and suggested that other 
areas of discord in the middle east could be helped toward peace 
leaders from brazil argentina poland and indonesia joined the 
chorus of condemnation of iraq that opened the 45th session of the 
general assembly while the iraqi ambassador watched in silence 
iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati broadened his 
criticism to include the united states saying its military buildup 
was aimed at backing imperial us designs not defending the 
nations of the persian gulf 
the french president flew to new york on the concorde for a 
brief appearance here speaking in french through a translator 
mitterrand told the 159nation general assembly let us be 
clear about this there is no compromise as long as iraq does not 
comply with resolutions of the security council and withdraw from 
kuwait the sovereignty of that country is not negotiable 
he later held out the possibility of peace outlining these 
three general steps toward that goal 
iraqi withdrawal from kuwait and freeing of thousands of 
westerners held captive by iraq 
international guarantees for withdrawal of foreign military 
forces restoration of the legitimate government of kuwait and the 
democratic will of the kuwaiti people 
replacing confrontation with the dynamics of good 
neighborliness and security and peace for each country 
he said this could ultimately spread a spirit of reconciliation 
to lebanon the palestinian people and israel but did not 
elaborate 
mitterrand also said a later stage would involve agreed mutual 
reductions of armaments in the area 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and british foreign 
secretary douglas hurd told reporters they expected the air embargo 
resolution to be adopted tuesday 
we want action there is no other way shevardnadze said 
through a translator 
hurd asked about recent bellicose comments by iraqi president 
saddam hussein said his statements will remain uncompromising 
until the day he decides to leave kuwait or he is thrown out of 
kuwait 
on sunday saddam hinted he would make mideast oil fields and 
israel his targets if iraqis were strangled by sanctions and 
other steps 
shevardnadze called those comments inadmissable and added 
any attacks would unleash a war and that would mean disaster 
the security council on monday adopted a brief resolution 
calling for aid to about a dozen nations suffering economic 
hardship as a result of the embargo against iraq 
mitterrand whose government has denounced iraq for invading 
french and other diplomatic premises in kuwait was unsparing in 
his condemnation of the baghdad government 
iraqs un ambassador abdul amir alanbari listened 
impassively from his seat as the french president spoke 
iraq has apologized to france for the raid on its ambassadors 
residence but mitterrand rejected iraqs apology saying saddam 
has offered not one gesture not one word to defuse the crisis 
he said french ships and troops would remain in the persian gulf 
until our mission is accomplished 
the united states has not given its permission for an iraqi 
airways flight to land in new york with an iraqi delegation from 
baghdad us officials have advised them to take commercial 
flights instead iraq said 
aziz said in baghdad that his government would not participate 
in the threeweek debate of world speakers because of the us 
restrictions 
iraq said monday it had rejected a us offer to allow the plane 
to land in exchange for the freeing of westerners including 1000 
americans trapped in iraq and kuwait 
in his speech mitterrand said iraqi aggression against kuwait 
is an example of the law of the jungle 
how could we not be disgusted by the taking of thousands of 
hostages he asked kuwait is a sovereign state a member of 
the international community in the name of what can one decide 
that this state has ceased to exist in the name of the law of 
planes tanks and trucks 
the french president warned that neighboring nations were 
endangered by the warlike state of iraq 
the assemblys annual parade of world leaders which began 
monday was dominated by the persian gulf crisis 
brazilian president fernando collor de mello the first speaker 
said the crisis presents an unexpected and serious threat to 
collective peace

the managing editor of the washington post 
says a reporter broke no law when he was arrested for allegedly 
contributing to the delinquency of a minor while working on a 
story 
im particularly concerned that the police pursued this after 
the reporter identified himself and his purpose and that the 
police took his notes said managing editor leonard downie jr 
michael j ybarra 23 a reporter with the posts metro staff 
was arrested late sept 21 while working on a report about a new 
curfew for minors in quantico va 
he was taken into custody and his notes confiscated while 
conducting an interview of two 12yearold boys in a restaurant in 
the virginia town about 30 miles south of the nations capital 
the quantico town council recently imposed a 10 pm to 6 am 
curfew for youths under age 18 following recent vandalism in the 
area 
ybarra is the second adult charged in connection with a curfew 
violation but no youths have been arrested 
i believe that the reporter was trying to do his job and just 
got mixed up at the wrong place and the wrong time said leo 
rodriguez quanticos police chief 
rodriguez said the reporters notes were held as evidence but a 
copy would be made available to the post 
ybarra who was released on his own recognizance is to be 
arraigned in prince william county juvenile and domestic relations 
court on sept 25 the charge carries a maximum penalty of one year 
in jail and a 2500 fine

a law applying iowas 4 percent sales 
tax to magazines while exempting newspapers was upheld by the state 
supreme court 
the court found no censorial threat motive or element 
imposed by the states tax policy and rejected a constitutional 
challenge by hearst corp publisher of cosmopolitan good 
housekeeping popular mechanics harpers bazaar sports afield and 
town and country 
the focus is not on the content of the journalism the court 
said sept 19 rather the form and frequency of the publication 
are the primary factors for determining whether a publication 
qualifies for the iowa sales and use tax exemption 
hearst had argued the tax law violated first amendment 
guarantees of freedom of the press giving the state the power to 
tax different publications at different levels or to exempt some 
amounts to granting censorship powers the company argued 
under iowa tax laws newspapers do not pay the 4 percent sales 
tax that magazines and other periodicals are required to pay 
regulations spell out the definitions of magazine and 
newspaper for tax purposes the most crucial centering on how 
often they are published 
the court conceded a tax exemption is a government subsidy but 
said legislators were within their rights in providing such a 
subsidy as long as it doesnt discriminate between similar media 
and is not impermissibly directed at a publications content 
hearst also had said the tax policy violated equal protection 
provisions but the court rejected that argument saying that while 
legislators cannot use a taxing power to block press organizations 
they are not required to help them either 
the constitution does not require that the government remove 
all obstacles in the path of the exercise of a persons rights 
said the opinion where government subsidies are not aimed at the 
suppression of dangerous ideas its power to encourage actions 
deemed to be in the public interest is necessarily far broader 
hearst also contended the tax law favored iowabased companies 
but the court rejected that saying newspapers were exempt from the 
tax no matter where they were published

federal regulators say audio and video recording 
equipment wont be allowed at the sept 25 public hearing on neil 
bushs role in the failure of silverado banking savings and loan 
bush who faces charges that he acted improperly as a director 
of silverado was scheduled to testify he was an outside director 
of silverado from 1985 until shortly before the thrift was seized 
by regulators in 1988 
bush has been accused of conflicts of interest in his dealings 
with former developers ken good and bill walters two major 
silverado borrowers 
the decision not to allow recording equipment angered rep pat 
schroeder dcolo and the colorado broadcasters association 
dan buck an administrative assistant to schroeder said he 
understood the federal office of thrift supervision wanting to 
avoid turning the hearing into a circus but the taxpayers have 
already bought 1 billion worth of ducats to the silverado failure 
and they should be able to see the investigative process he 
said 
past administrative hearings have been closed to the public 
entirely in july because of interest in the national savings and 
loan fiasco the policy was changed but recording devices still 
are not permitted at office of thrift supervision hearings 
the broadcasters association sent a letter to the agencys 
director timothy ryan requesting at least one television camera 
inside the neil bush hearing 
the association also asked ryan to move the hearing from 
denvers federal courthouse building where video equipment never 
is permitted he suggested other hearing sites that allow cameras 
including the university of denver and state and county courtrooms 
the broadcast media makes a judgment in terms of what they 
believe the public is most interested in said andrew low an 
attorney for the association and kusatv in denver 
it is beyond question that neil bushs involvement in the 
failure of silverado is of considerable public interest 
particularly in colorado where neil bush lives low said

legislation to reregulate the cable television 
industry may not get a final vote by congress this year the 
chairman of the federal communications commission told broadcasters 
sept 18 
alfred c sikes said the continuing housesenate negotiations on 
the federal budget could cause the delay the house has passed a 
cable bill but a vote on a similar measure in the senate still is 
pending 
he made the remarks in responding to questions posed at a lunch 
held by the international radio and television society in new york 
only a month ago sikes said he would have said he felt there 
was a substantial likelihood of a final vote by both houses this 
year 
but now i think that in some ways the fate of the cable 
legislation is tied to federal budget negotiations he said 
as the talks drag on and if negotiators tighten the rules on 
floor action in congress it would seem to me that the cable 
legislation will run out of time for a final vote before the 
current session of congress ends he said 
the bush administration strongly opposes the house bill saying 
congress should instead encourage new forms of competition to 
cable that industry was largely freed of regulation by congress in 
1984 
among other things the house measure passed in response to 
increasing complaints about overpricing and shoddy cable tv 
service would impose federal price limits on basic cable service 
it also would give the fcc power to order price rollbacks on the 
worst offenders and boost competition to cable which now serves 
589 percent of the nations 931 million homes with tv according 
to nielsen estimates

wayne newton asked a federal appeals court to 
reconsider a ruling that overturned his record 52 million libel 
judgment against nbc news for a 1980 broadcast linking him to 
organized crime 
lawyers for newton said the 9th us circuit court of appeals 
overlooked or misconstrued some evidence and interpreted other 
evidence unfairly in favor of nbc in its aug 30 ruling 
in a petition asking for a rehearing the attorneys said that 
failing to overturn the verdict would chill the rights of public 
figures to bring defamation suits against powerful media 
defendants 
newton attorney morton galane said sept 20 that he filed the 
petition 
a jury in las vegas found that nbcs story falsely implied that 
organized crime figures had helped newton buy the aladdin hotel and 
casino in exchange for a hidden interest 
it awarded newton 193 million but that was later reduced to 
52 million mostly in punitive damages

the owners of wsnstv in chicago lost a 
lengthy license renewal battle sept 19 when the federal 
communications commission in a rare move said a competing 
applicant was more deserving to run the station 
the commission granted monroe communications corp a license to 
build a new tv station on channel 44 it said monroe was more 
qualified than the current licensee video 44 which had switched 
the stations format to a subscription movie service 
monroe which began seeking the license in 1982 also claimed 
video 44 had broadcast obscene material but the fcc did not reach 
a decision on that allegation 
the fcc almost never denies license renewals to incumbents and 
already had given video 44 a renewal in 1989 but the commission 
reconsidered the case under orders from a federal appeals court in 
washington 
video 44 may appeal the decision to the appeals court 
otherwise it must discontinue operations 90 days after the fcc 
formally releases its renewal order which could occur sometime in 
the next week or so fcc spokeswoman maureen peratino said

convention of the southern newspaper publishers association in

high in the citys center surrounded by 
waterways that once fed the gardens of feudal lords the stout 
walls of kanazawa castle stand ready against attack 
war however hasnt come to kanazawa in 400 years instead 
nearly 6 million tourists annually invade this hakusan mountain 
city on the japan sea that is largely unknown to the west 
almost all the modernday invaders are japanese nostalgic for a 
glimpse of what their country was like before it acquired its 
westernized concreteandglass exterior 
more recently though realty and construction companies have 
begun to lay siege to kanazawa 
historic buildings still stand because the city escaped bombing 
during world war ii today next to the boutiques of nouveau riche 
japan craftsmen in 100yearold wood shops fabricate shamisen and 
koto japanese stringed instruments and the regions richly 
colored kutani pottery samurai houses of yesteryear are still 
inhabited 
in and around kanazawa which means marsh of gold small 
factories produce 98 percent of japans gold leaf pounding tiny 
nuggets into featherlight sheets as big as 18squarefoot tatami 
mats 
those who want to find the old japan here however had better 
hurry 
the inexorable influence of tokyo 185 miles southeast is again 
changing kanazawas face 
ironically it was pressure from the capital 350 years ago that 
prompted kanazawas ruling maeda clan to begin investing heavily in 
the traditional arts as lords of japans richest fiefdom they 
wanted to allay fears they were building an army against the 
tokyobased shogunate 
today tokyos giant real estate companies are helping reverse 
that centuriesold focus on tradition having run out of room in 
the tokyo region corporations are swiftly developing land in and 
around kanazawa and elsewhere on the main island of honshu said 
yoichi nakanishi governor of ishikawa prefecture which includes 
kanazawa 
the cramped wooden houses and shops of an earlier era virtually 
worthless except for historical value are being bulldozed under 
and replaced by new structures he said 
its a pity isnt it said the 72yearold governor 
kanazawa is a place where people can live like human beings 
nakanishi says he uses his nose to measure the changes in his 
beloved city 
too quickly he laments the aroma of crowded fish and vegetable 
shops is giving way to the smell of fresh concrete office 
buildings and condominiums in midst of construction are visible 
nearly everywhere 
according to a recent prefectural study only 7 percent of the 
total prewar homes remain in this city of 450000 people 
kanazawa however is working to preserve whats left under a 
10yearold government program funded by tourism revenue which 
totaled 240 million in 1989 the city pays owners of traditional 
houses up to 90 percent of the cost of restoring the delicate 
latticewood exteriors said sadao kunizawa of kanazawas tourism 
division 
even so negotiations with residents are sometimes difficult 
people like to look at the old houses but they dont like to 
live in them theyre inconvenient said yaeko ikuno a housewife 
who lives in the citys famed geisha district where preservation 
efforts are focused they would disappear without the 
governments help 
many residents nonetheless remain proud of their citys 
tradition most still finish their houses with kanazawas 
distinctive black roof tiles which shimmer in the sunlight 
locals point out that kyoto japans ancient capital went into 
decline during the edo tokyo period the 250 years of national 
isolation that preceded japans opening to the west in the mid19th 
century 
but kanazawa was born and flourished during that period when 
many of modern japans social structures were developed and 
stillpopular arts such as noh theater and tea ceremonies were 
refined 
as a result residents say in kyoto the traditional part of 
the city is set apart as a kind of museum piece in kanazawa 
however the historical culture is still a part of everyday life 
japanese have a strong attachment to the edo period said 
sonoko matsuda head of the society to introduce kanazawa to the 
world a residents committee and they can find it in 
kanazawa

a 15minute walk from the glassandneon glitz of 
tokyos ginza district is a tiny enclave of older japan that is 
fighting a losing battle for survival 
a glimpse of a bygone time can be had on the islands of 
tsukudajima and tsukishima which escaped the us bombers that 
leveled much of the rest of tokyo in world war ii 
traditional woodframe houses line alleys cluttered by potted 
plants guarding every door children play in the narrow streets 
while older folk chat with old buddies preserving the slower pace 
of life that was the norm before japans economic ascent 
the feel of old edo the name of tokyo during the feudal era 
was captured one august sunday during a traditional festival that 
binds the 300 families of tsukudajima with the past 
hundreds of spectators gathered to cheer tsukudajima fishermen 
as they heaved a gilded shrine onto a barge in sumida river as part 
of a summer festival held every three years since the mid1600s 
the barge then circled the island community to bless the 
surrounding waters accompanied by priests and the music of flute 
and drums 
feverish real estate speculation however is threatening to 
destroy these remnants of prewar tokyo 
since 1988 when a 40story deluxe apartment tower was built 
next to tsukudajima and a subway line was extended to the two 
islands skyrocketing land prices have begun to take a toll 
many residents say they have been offered as much as 200000 
for their small homes some have sold out and the two 
neighborhoods are now dotted with boardedup stores and other 
property lying unused while speculators wait for land prices to 
rise further 
shocked by such speculation urban planners have been trying to 
work out a development plan for the islands before its too late 
uzumi yoshida head of chuo ward regional improvement section 
says the city government hopes to preserve the neighborhoods 
traditional role as workingclass residential areas 
but yoshida acknowledged his authority was limited 
japan has placed very few restrictions on land ownership its 
only recently with land values going through the roof that the 
government has attempted to curb speculation he said 
toshie narusawa a 52yearold tsukishima resident doubts the 
governments sincerity 
city officers are trying to raise the buildingtoland ratio 
they told me this we want to make the tsukishima area into new 
yorks manhattan she said 
narusawa believes government officials look down on the working 
people of tsukishima and tsukudajima and are convinced that modern 
apartment buildings are preferable to the traditional tiny 
fireprone homes 
but she responds there are many people who are glad to live 
in those houses and are proud of it 
so far no citizens movement has formed to defend the two 
districts 
instead since tokyo entered the modern era it has destroyed 
its past in a constant race to import all thats new to fulfill its 
role as japans showcase to the world said paul waley urban 
historian and author of tokyo now and then 
narusawa believes the districts subdivision into small 
individual plots and stubborn resistence of some longtime residents 
will thwart efforts to turn the islands into highrise jungles 
but even if the neighborhoods change locals say the festival 
will continue to provide the glue to hold the community together 
every three years former residents as well as family members 
return from all parts of japan to take part 
the festival is even helping to weld the newr parts of town to 
old tsukudajima and tsukishima says local assemblyman and festival 
organizer yoichiro fujima 
this was the first year that people from the new apartments 
could participate in the festival so if participating one time 
leads to two times two times lead to three and it continues like 
that the newcomers will help old tsukudajima retain its culture

with saddam hussein as the poster boy the 
national defense gift fund is suddenly flush 20 billion and 
counting for an unlikely charity that used to draw only petty 
cash 
under prodding from congress and highprofile administration 
solicitors us allies have agreed to provide at least that much 
in mney and services to share the financial burden of the middle 
east crisis 
the government has been accepting donations for national defense 
for 36 years donations totaling 60310533 in all that time the 
gifts went to the pentagon without much notice because there wasnt 
much money involved 
that changed when the united states sought and got pledges of 
allied contributions to help pay for operation desert shield and 
other costs of countering the iraqi invasion of kuwait 
at first the administration figured on using the old system to 
handle the new bonanza so that the donated funds would be funneled 
to the pentagon it also sought to make that explicit in an 
emergency appropriations bill with a provision to permit use of 
donated funds and supplies as the secretary of defense deems 
appropriate 
but congress quickly spotted the loophole in its authority over 
defense spending and is moving to shut it an amendment adopted by 
the house and a bill proposed in the senate would require 
appropriations by congress before the pentagon spends donated 
funds and regular accountings of the use of supplies services and 
other gifts 
that takes away leeway the pentagon wanted but the 
administration is not insisting it would have been nowin anyhow 
and politically costly 
sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee 
had warned two weeks ago that if us operations in desert shield 
were to be largely bankrolled by outside contributions there 
would have to be a way for congress to supervise the spending 
he told secretary of defense dick cheney two weeks ago that the 
1954 defense gift act wouldnt suffice because it was set up for 
relatively small donations to the defense effort 
for almost 20 years nobody gave a penny the first contribution 
wasnt made until 1973 the fund got 279 that year defense 
donations since then have varied widely often up in times of 
stress down when times are placid 
under the 1954 law money donated for defense goes into the 
national defense conditional gift fund and is added to the 
pentagon appropriation that comes closest to the intent of the 
donor 
the statute certainly never contemplated that such a petty 
cash fund would be used to accept donations of billions of dollars 
from foreign countries said sen robert c byrd dwva 
chairman of the appropriations committee 
if we learned anything from irancontra it is that you dont 
have these kind of slush funds added sen patrick j leahy 
dvt 
at the same time congress is keeping up the pressure for other 
nations to contribute more toward the cost of defending saudi 
arabia and punishing iraq the administration had opened that drive 
with secretary of state james a baker iii and secretary of the 
treasury nicholas f brady traveling world capitals seeking 
commitments to share the burden 
in congress there were angry protests that other nations 
dependent on persian gulf oil particularly japan and west germany 
werent contributing enough to the operation 
japan first offered 1 billion upped to 4 billion in military 
and other assistance after a storm of protest that included a house 
vote to start withdrawing us forces from japan unless tokyo paid 
in full for keeping them there west germany now has offered 21 
billion the rest is coming in various forms from other nations 
allied in the operation and the sanctions approved by the united 
nations 
it isnt clear how much of the foreign contribution will 
actually pass through us hands anyhow the japanese announced 
friday that they were setting up a 900 million peace fund as 
the first installment of their pledge to the perian gulf 
operation that it wouldnt be used for weapons and that they 
would administer it in cooperation with the arab states 
that doesnt fit the notion that allied checks are in the mail 
to washington promises are easy cash is harder leahy said 
i want to see the cash 
nor does it fit the idea that foreign fundraising drives may 
become a fixture in us diplomacy a new device well try to be 
using more often in the future as deputy secretary of state 
lawrence eagleburger told a house hearing 
without saddam hussein or his ilk as the villain vital oil 
supplies as an underlying issue and an atmosphere of urgent crisis 
to spur the process it will be hard to mount a matching quest for 
contributions

enough about michael jackson pay no 
attention to those premature reports 
yes the gloved one has been approached about singing with the 
animated one but no it is not a done deal which is why the 
recent stories about jackson doing a duet with bart simpson have 
infuriated the folks over at fox broadcasting cos hit cartoon 
show 
especially perturbed is simpsons creator matt groening who 
plops down at a west hollywood recording studio and grants a speedy 
interview about the latest project to come from americas favorite 
dysfunctional family 
oh its so frustrating says the cartoonist i said to a 
reporter a while ago that i would like to have this happen and it 
was printed as if it was true 
what groening wished for was jacksons participation in the 
simpsons sing the blues an incongruous title for the debut album 
of an overnight success story what groening is afraid of is that 
all the publicity will send the obsessively mediashy jackson 
scurrying from negotiations 
this may kill it groening says we have a whole wish list 
of people wed like to use on the album stevie ray vaughan was 
lined up then he was killed 
milling around the recording studio this day are the actors who 
provide the voices for the simpsons 
there is julie kavner whose scratchy vocals come out of marges 
animated mouth and dan castellaneta who talks for the 
longsuffering dad homer sitting nearby is yeardley smith the 
voice of the highminded daughter lisa nancy cartwright nursing 
a cold and chugging evian water drops in and out of barts 
unmistakable whining monotone 
the four performers have been working on the simpsons sings 
the blues for about a month so far they have completed only two 
rough cuts in between taping shows for the simpsons fall 
season which begins oct 13 
due out in november the disc contains an eclectic mix of old 
blues tunes such as billie hollidays god bless the child and 
original songs such as deep deep trouble produced by rapper 
dj jazzy jeff and written by groening 
fox has been trying to keep the record under wraps until 
negotiations with performers like jackson are nailed down but word 
has leaked out to the great consternation of those involved 
jacksons duet was to come on do the bartman and published 
reports have said it was penned by jackson it wasnt which 
prompted producer and filmmaker james l brooks to issue a press 
release late last week apologizing for any misunderstanding about 
who actually wrote the tune the composer is jackson pal bryan 
loren 
in a marketing blitz highlighted by simpson tshirts thermoses 
watches and coming soon to a video arcade near you a simpsons 
pinball machine why are the simpsons singing 
james l brooks walked into the office one day and said the 
simpsons sing the blues explains groening then we all spent 
a lot of time deciding what the blues was 
the final decisions for the album include chuck berrys school 
day sung by bart booker t jones born under a bad sign 
sung by homer and the moanin lisa blues sung by well you 
know 
back at the studio fox has organized a media event pulling in 
nearly a halfdozen camera crews to interview and tape the wouldbe 
recording stars in action 
problem is there is no action the four actors are not laying 
down tracks for the album instead much time is spent standing 
around while they pretend theyre singing for the benefit of the 
cameras 
the phenomenal success of the simpsons begets such hype the 
animated family with alltoocommon frailties has gone beyond being 
a hit television show it has become part of pop culture 
this point is not lost on the young fox network which made a 
brash decision this season to put the simpsons up against nbcs 
toprated but aging the cosby show 
some of the simpsons cast think foxs decision was foolish 
since moving to thursdays at 8 pm the cartoon show that once 
peaked at no 4 in the nielsen ratings has plummeted to 45th place 
i think it is a mistake says kavner its a sweet little 
show it belongs on sunday nights 
castellaneta is more upbeat nobodys happy about it says 
the voice of homer but i dont think its going to hurt us 
cartwright sounding nothing like bart added its really 
like if it aint broke dont fix it we did fine on sunday 
nights 
says groening this is a very wild time weve got a lot of 
things going on there are some very good singers in the 
simpsons this is going to be a big record 
 
elsewhere in television 
not banned on payperview a nov 8 los angeles concert by 
rappers 2 live crew whose explicit recordings have been banned in 
record stores will be carried live via satellite on a payperview 
basis a portion of the suggested 1995 viewing fee will benefit 
the american civil liberties unions musical majority to fight 
censorship

the boy clad in a leather toga sat on a 
cowhide in a circle of male relatives and stared hard at the 
strangers knife 
the stranger squatted over the boy made a circular incision 
with his knife and seven minutes later gibson leisamato 16 was a 
man a circumcised warrior of the samburu tribe 
unflinchingly the youngster had endured the delicate operation 
without anaesthesia not until the circumciser had finished did he 
make a sound 
now i want cows gibson shouted at the end of the ordeal a 
traditional rite of passage for men among most of this east african 
nations 40odd tribes some also circumcise females but secretly 
because of a government ban 
but medical authorities are concerned about the safety of the 
tradition especially its possible contribution to the spread of 
aids kenya has nearly 10000 diagnosed cases of the deadly 
disease 
traditionally circumcisers use the same knife on any group of 
young men at a given location and time this supposedly creates a 
lifelong bond between the initiates 
but the circumciser also uses the same cloth to wipe the 
knife says duncan mutembei a male nurse working among the 
samburu some dont wash between operations 
the crude surgery invites infections and every year several 
young men bleed to death due to a slip of a knife circumcisers 
themselves sometimes pay harshly for their mistakes 
newspapers in the capital of nairobi reported the case this year 
of a circumciser who was stoned to death by an angry mob after he 
cut more than intended from one boy the youngster lived 
joseph oliech kenyas health director has proposed testing and 
licensing of the circumcisers to ensure competence most learn 
their trade as apprentices 
for the circumciser the rite is good business relatively few 
in number they perform as many as 50 operations a day earning as 
much as some laborers make in a month fees are 5 to 7 an 
operation 
six hours after his operation and still in sharp pain gibson 
stoically rejoiced in his new status as a moran or warrior of his 
northern kenya tribe 
now i am a man he said i can have girlfriends i can get 
married 
for most tribes the circumcision right is an annual event for 
the samburu it occurs only once every 15 years but for all it is 
a time of celebration dance and song 
wamba rashid an anthropologist at the university of nairobi 
explains the significance of the event for young men 
it is a way of welcoming them into adulthood before then they 
were nobodys it is a way of telling them you are no longer a 
child you have rights and responsibilities to the community 
some of those responsibilities are long gone 
samburu morans no longer defend the tribe police do and they 
dont kill lions to prove their bravery its against the law 
but after the ritual young men can have girlfriends get 
married own property and participate in other adult activities 
whatever his tribe the initiate must face the surgery bravely 
without a flinch cry or moan or shame his family 
i was so worried my son would show fear i could not eat 
before he was circumsiced said gibsons mother najoko 
after the ritual sages instruct the initiated in the tribes 
customs sometimes for up to a month 
the mutilation is talked of most says rashid but there 
is the education and psychological changes that occur 
in urban areas boys are increasingly being circumcised in 
hospitals where health risks are greatly reduced 
but many feel hospitals are for cowards so the tradition of 
facing the knife endures 
it generates respect among individuals says samuel 
lekesion a samburu and former policeman it also guarantees 
survival if i am in trouble i can always call upon my age 
mates

it has become fashionable to blame real estate 
developers for overdoing things for building too many speculative 
projects for glutting the market with buildings when demand is 
headed down 
as a result developers are often seen today as impractical 
dreamers rather than lionized as imaginative shrewd insightful 
gutsy risktakers as they were yesterday 
yes they overdid it as they are prone to do but the bankers 
did too the developers couldnt have overbuilt without the money 
and the commercial lenders of america shoveled it at them 
if the developers went from one extreme to another the bankers 
may have done so even more abruptly after building their real 
estate portfolios they have closed them down so that good 
investments and bad alike are denied 
a report by the general accounting office shows that real estate 
portfolios held by commercial banks in 1985 made up 266 percent of 
their total loans and leases after rising every year the 
percentage reached 37 percent in 1989 
it couldnt have happened of course if the banks hadnt let it 
happen but the evidence shows clearly that they thought real 
estate as an investment was becoming relatively better than 
investing in commerce and industry 
in 1985 about 35 percent of their outstanding loans were in the 
commercialindustrial category that percentage declined every year 
through 1989 when it reached 301 percent 
the performance of real estate loans deteriorated as their 
percentage of total portfolios rose in 1988 24 percent of 
commercial bank real estate loans were noncurrent in 1989 it had 
risen to 29 percent 
in those figures lies some of the reason for what seems to be a 
growing credit crunch that at first involved only small companies 
mostly developers in the northeast but which has spread to big and 
small companies everywhere 
what had been the most desired investment now seems to be the 
least desirable for developers in certain areas to obtain bank 
money today would mean dismissal for the loan officer and 
conceivably a federal investigation 
it is not the first instance of extreme behavior by banks in 
the 1970s for example they shipped billions of dollars abroad to 
less developed nations willing to pay premium rates while 
homemortgage applications were denied 
billions of dollars of those ldc loans as they are called are 
considered nonperforming now and commercial banks have been forced 
to set aside reserves to cover what some bank analysts believe are 
inevitable writeoffs 
the irony of the current crackdown on loans provoked mainly by 
the tooeasy lending policies of a few years ago is that real 
estate developments begun in the next year might be finished when 
demand is growing again 
but neither real estate development nor banking seem to be 
gifted with the farsightedness they claim both get excited when 
commercial development is at a feverish pace and they collapse 
together when the bad results are in 
history shows that some of the costliest real estate 
developments in america are ready just as the market becomes 
glutted and just before the economy turns down 
and when the economy is down and preparing for an upturn a 
couple of years hence neither seems to have the heart or the 
foresight to invest

lenox mass ap for donald wilkinson who describes himself 
as an unbelievable hustler a singing career demands a polished 
baritone voice steel nerves and a computer 
it has meant singing with wellknown conductors and orchestras 
as well as performing at nursing homes often without pay 
at 29 wilkinson is a former electrical engineer who in 1987 
quit his 29000ayear job with gte in needham mass to take a 
very vocal chance 
now hes 9000 in debt but with a voice as rich as his 
promise 
in phyllis curtins master classes in recent weeks his voice 
has blossomed 
to release his tense neck muscles one morning curtin asked him 
to sing the highest note he could reach with his head dangling over 
a chair in another class she massaged his lips while he was 
singing 
the unusual efforts paid off out came a vibrant tone that 
boomed into the roughhewn wooden slabs of the small theater like 
rich controlled thunder 
for me its a perfect time all kinds of colors are coming 
into my voice he says what loosened him up he says was 
thinking of curtins idea of a tree and roots and blossoming at 
the top 
at home in brighton mass a personal computer holds another 
secret to his future files containing information on orchestras 
choral societies opera companies and festivals for which he can 
audition 
having been an engineer im very organized he says 
building a career means constantly going through papers updating 
phone numbers trying to get out of some secretary what theyll be 
doing next year 
meanwhile wilkinson who is single has had no health insurance 
for three years 
while he was still an engineer his bosses let him rearrange his 
schedule so he could go to auditions and rehearsals that often 
meant working sundays and evenings or going to work at 430 am 
and leaving at 830 am 
now besides singing with such prestigious groups as bostons 
handel and haydn society he earns money at funerals and weddings 
and nursing homes at 40 or less a shot when elderly people enjoy 
his performance he sometimes sings for free 
but each year is better financially he says and hes inching 
up to his engineers salary 
its really difficult he says you have to be an 
unbelievable hustler calling people saying youll drive five 
hours to audition even if they dont give you a job 
but on a recent morning at tanglewood wilkinson for once 
doesnt have to hustle 
relaxed in loose redandwhite striped pants and a tshirt he 
lavishes his voice on valentins aria from gounods faust for 
phyllis curtin 
the young soldier is going off to fight for france and for 
glory and like lots of soldiers hes probably a farmer boy hes 
going to put a little dirt in his pocket its simple its 
direct she says mock marching as he sings 
good good good curtin murmurs 
im always magnetized by her teaching wilkinson says later

editors note they call it sky city a towering mesa in

pueblo indians a community of potters its a place where little 
has changed over the centuries a place where ancient rituals are

an autumn chill now hangs over sky city a 
sunhardened citadel of clay and rock that is said to be the oldest 
continuously occupied community in the united states 
on a recent day hundreds of indian dancers and potters 
displayed their talents as the acoma pueblo community observed the 
350th annual san estaban feast day with sprinklings of cornmeal to 
bless the earth 
afterward most acomas returned to their homes in the valley 
below but a few mostly potters are staying on for the windy 
winter atop this sandstone stronghold 7000 feet above sea level 
up here on top of the mesa there are 12 to 15 families that 
live all year long says camille pasquale a potter who helps 
guide tourists through the ancient fortress which survived a 
16thcentury spanish invasion 
survival cost dearly 100 men killed scores enslaved and many 
others punished by having their feet severed 
its quiet now the stillness soaks up sound voices 10 feet 
away vanish like steam a little boy following his dog down narrow 
lanes shyly sneaks glances at strangers every other doorway 
displays pottery 
every year the tribe chooses field chiefs who live here with 
their families each generally representing one of acomas 14 
clans 
the acomas say they have been here more than 1000 years they 
first settled on neighboring enchanted mesa which was later 
abandoned and then 800 years ago moved to sky city a 
367foothigh mesa that was declared a national landmark in 1960 
water is still carried in not piped no wires bring in phone 
calls or electricity no gas lines here 
like the ancient timbers used in the villages 17thcentury san 
esteban mission church the firewood for heating and cooking is 
hauled here from as far away as mount taylor 40 miles to the 
north 
san esteban feast day acomas big fall celebration marked the 
end of the hot weather and the summer tourist season that brought 
in 200 to 300 visitors a day 
on sept 2 a procession carried the carved wooden statue of st 
stephen from his church on the southwest corner of the mesa to a 
shrine on the central plaza the shrine as always was decorated 
with cuttings of corn aspen and wild daisies flanked by guards 
bearing muskets dating back more than a century 
inside the shrine tribal leaders formally accept the acomas 
offerings of food to the saint 
then the whitebuffalo dancers each carrying a multicolored 
lightning bolt begin their celebration their bells and silver 
jewelry jangling three men in white skins skirts and brown 
leather leggings and three women in wrapped white buckskin leggings 
and floral print shifts black skirts and white sash vests dance to 
the beat of a single drummer 
following them a succession of other troupes enter in turn from 
different corners of the square two by two each performing in 
front of the shrine the women with large red dots on their 
cheekbones the men with rustcolored swabs for protection fox 
pelts dangle from their belts fir boughs adorn their sleeves 
the church dominates the southwest corner of the mesa the acoma 
women helped franciscan missionaries complete it from 1629 to 1640 
just as they prepare it every year for the fiesta 
the women and children brought the sand from the valley up in 
baskets says fran torivio a sky city guide and cashier at the 
acoma office below 
the walled courtyard in front of the church is a cemetery the 
wall is topped with weathered adobe busts of warriors 
these are the soldiers that guard the cemetery pasquale 
says 
the soldiers are restored annually before the fiesta with new 
potsherds for their eyes and new smiles carved into the clay 
acomas would lock themselves in the church when under attack by 
navajos or apaches usually around harvest time torivio says 
tourists still can climb down the ancient stairway carved in the 
mesas northwest face or they can ride a tour bus

acomas say their ancestors arrived here from mesa verde in what 
is now southern colorado according to legend they were told by 
iatiku mother of all indians to seek a mesa resembling the tip of 
an ear of corn which symbolizes iatiku 
when they saw enchanted mesa they believed they had arrived at 
the center of the earth 
by various accounts enchanted mesa was abandoned after 
earthquakes andor rainstorms destroyed its ancient staircase 
stranding a few residents on top some died jumping or falling 
others starved most were already down on the valley floor 
farming they began anew at sky city leaving ruins on enchanted 
mesa 
acomas say theyve been at sky city since about 1200 
in 1540 spaniards came looking vainly for gold in the fabled 
seven cities of cibola it is said the golden glint of mica window 
panes reflecting the sunset attracted the spaniards to acoma 
they thought this was the seven cities of gold and they could 
see shining stuff in the rocks but its all sandstone torivio 
says 
juan de onate spanish governor of new mexico claimed acoma for 
the king the affable acomas greeted him warmly in 1598 but 
eventually decided to resist 
when onates nephew juan de zaldivar stopped here shortly 
afterward for provisions he and 12 of his men were massacred 
zaldivars brother vicente with a force of 70 men quickly 
avenged their deaths 
besides the 100 acoma men slain 60 young girls were taken to 
mexico as slaves and the young men and women who remained here also 
were kept in servitude each adult man had a foot severed 
in the succeeding century the indians sometimes took their 
frustrations out on priests throwing a couple of clerics off the 
cliff behind the church but acoma has been peaceful since 1690 
spanish is not a language the acomas generally speak alhough 
many have spanish surnames they speak keresan an ancient pueblo 
tongue and english 
most acomas today live in villages such as acomita and mccartys 
in the 30 miles between sky city and interstate 40 about 50 miles 
west of albuquerque 
our total population is about 4000 people but they live in 
other villages because our other villages have electricity and 
running water torivio says thats where we have all the 
modern homes thats where we have the tv the shower and the 
microwave 
in the old days acoma potters got their clay from the mountains 
and mixed in groundup shards from old pots they made their pots 
by hand and fired them in woodfueled adobe kilns 
though many potters today use readymade ware fired in electric 
kilns the designs are still authentic acoma acoma is known for 
its fineline designs painted with yuccastem brushes 
the yucca stem is chewed so that a few fibers form a primitive 
brush the fewer the fibers the finer the brush line the thin 
repetitive lines represent rain until recently acomas only 
source of water collected in natural rock cisterns around the 
mesa 
during the peak tourism periods of summer 20 to 30 potters sell 
their wares here including sky citys oldest resident concepcion 
faustine who is at least 80 years old 
ive been here since 1909 she says in halting english 
mostly she speaks keresan this day she is selling indian fry 
bread and small handmade pots painted with brown and black designs 
potters still pray to clay woman before starting a pot 
jackie torivio no relation to fran torivio majored in business 
administration at the college of santa fe and now she and husband 
mike run the family potterymaking business 
he makes the pots for me and i do the design she says 
but being a field chief a clan representative chosen to live 
for a year at sky city has cut into mikes pottery making she 
says 
jackie and mike torivio have a house in mccartys 
i go down weekly to check my answering machine and get the 
mail and do laundry all the things that we dont have up here 
she says

editors note after decades of exclusion western scholars 
recently were allowed to travel chinas fabled silk road in search 
of archaeological treasures but it was look dont touch the 
chinese are resentful of westerners hauling off vestiges of their 
heritage 
</TEXT>

more than 4000 years after east met west 
in the swirling sands of chinas western deserts modern 
treasureseekers are unlocking clues to the past along the ancient 
silk road 
isolated by location and for political and military reasons 
most of the silk road for decades has been closed to foreign 
scholars 
the government has jealously guarded its riches resentful of 
western archaeologists who removed thousands of priceless documents 
and works of art from the region in the late 19th and early 20th 
century 
however a recent monthlong desert expedition sponsored by the 
united nations education scientific and cultural organization gave 
about 80 foreign and chinese scholars and journalists a rare 
opportunity to travel the silk road and to discuss ways to preserve 
its ancient heritage 
marco polo genghis khan and alexander the great followed the 
silk road 
camel caravans braved the harsh desert to bring chinas silk 
roses and paper to the west they carried colorglazing techniques 
jade and cotton north and eastward into china 
the desolate taklamakan desert was originally inhabited by 
nomads and traders who built cities and bazaars in oases clinging 
tenuously to life in the desert sand 
historians who are still unearthing cataloging and 
interpreting archaeological evidence from the region say the first 
chinese conquest of the region was in the early han dynasty about 
200 to 300 bc 
despite its desolation the silk road and the surrounding desert 
is a strategic crossroads between africa europe and asia mongols 
chinese tibetans and moslem uyghurs have fought over this 
strategic territory nestled between tibet mongolia persia india 
and china 
today the region is still rocked by periodic moslem rebellions 
an antichinese riot this spring almost led to the cancellation of 
the expedition participants said 
after several postponements the expedition began on july 20 in 
xian the easternmost end of the silk road some 150 miles from 
the great wall that traditionally marked the edge of chinese 
civilization 
after the expedition ended aug 18 in the western bazaar city of 
kashgar scholars and journalists gathered in urumqi capital of 
chinas westernmost xinjiang autonomous region to review and share 
their findings 
foreign scholars traveling with the group said chinas decision 
to go ahead with the expedition apparently was intended to 
demonstrate its willingness to continue opening up to the outside 
world despite political repression following the crushing of 
studentled democracy movements in june 1989 
i think the opening to the outside world economically has 
finally begun to enter the intellectual sphere said richard b 
stamps professor of anthropology and chinese studies at oakland 
university in rochester mich 
stamps said discussion of possible joint research projects could 
eventually lead to the lifting of a ban on foreign participation in 
chinese archaeological digs 
the expedition was very useful for the foreign scholars like 
myself who have wanted all their lives to come work in china now 
we have name cards and contact people who have long worked in 
isolation stamps said 
isenbike aricanli togan professor of inner asian history at 
washington university said i have been working on the history 
of xinjiang for over 20 years and this was the first time i could 
actually see it you can imagine how excited i was 
the exchange yielded some surprises caucasian human remains 
from tombs more than 3000 years old near hami indicated a link 
between asia and europe that may explain why some languages such 
as tibetan are indoeuropean said ahmad hasan dani director of 
the pakistan center for the study of the civilization of central 
asia

many of the scholars identified symbols and architecture proving 
ancient cultural influences from persia and india in china 
but scholars and journalists who traveled the entire 6125 miles 
of the silk road and its byways by car truck camel and donkey 
cart said they were frustrated by limits imposed as they viewed 
longawaited murals and sculptures 
the chinese are very protective and jealous of their 
copyrights said one participant who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
he said in some cases they were charging as much as 100 for 
photos and in many other cases they refused to allow photographs or 
sketching at all many scholars were forced to rely only on their 
memories of what they saw he said 
chinese leaders of the expedition say the limits were based on 
concerns about damage to the exhibits and on time constraints 
our task was not to excavate or discover archaeological 
sites said xu pingfang director of the institute of history at 
the chinese academy of social sciences many of these things have 
never been seen by foreigners before and the museums have never 
been opened before 
stamps said the constraints also were based on an international 
tradition that maintains that the finder of an archaeological 
discovery should be the first to publish the findings 
the chinese are struggling to get the massive volume of 
artifacts found in the past decade into libraries he said 
only some have been published 
the expedition raised delicate questions about the ownership and 
preservation of ancient artifacts 
many artifacts taken from the silk roads magnificent tombs 
temples and grottoes now sit in european and western museums they 
form the basis of central asian research in the west 
a call by chinese journalist li xiguang for the return of those 
treasures to china prompted some western scholars to suggest that 
some items or at least their reproductions should be returned to 
their places of origin 
others argued however that the wealth of the silk road belongs 
to all mankind and that an international effort such as that 
initiated by the getty foundation for the buddhist grottoes at 
dunhuang is needed to prevent its destruction 
dunhuangs nearly 500 caves have been called a 1600yearold 
art gallery of buddhist culture but its thousands of magnificent 
frescoes and statues are threatened by pollution and other changes 
in the environment caused partly by thousands of visitors each 
year 
members of the expedition spoke of buddhist sculptures kept in 
unroofed earthen museums that were literally disintegrating 
because local curators lacked the funds and technology to preserve 
them 
unfortunately archaeologists in china sometimes lack the 
sophisticated controls that we maintain in the west they have the 
funds to dig but not to curate their findings said one scholar 
who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the fact that we have those pieces in france has raised some 
questions about conservation said jacques gies curator at the 
guimet museum in paris 
gies said researchers in france recently have developed ways to 
extract destructive salts that ruin crude earth sculptures without 
destroying their color or quality 
we are working very hard to transmit and to preserve the 
heritage we have inherited said christa paula a researcher at 
the university of londons school of oriental and african studies 
which also has many documents and artifacts taken from sites along 
the silk road

editors note many alcoholics shy away from alcoholics 
anonymous because of its religious overtones and now there are 
groups that offer a psychological alternative while they are 
growing they walk a thin financial line 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for some alcoholics who cannot abide the idea of 
praying for relief from their addiction there are alternatives 
some are spinoffs from alcoholics anonymous and some are within aa 
itself 
many members of alcoholics anonymous say they need some sort of 
spiritual awareness but bill talley an atheist and a recovering 
alcoholic is one of a growing number of former drinkers who have 
found an alternative to spiritual treatment for their illness 
in some of the more sophisticated major cities such as new york 
one aa member says the organization is aware of the religious 
problem and has sanctioned groups which look for professional help 
it also tries to accommodate such diverse groups as lesbians gays 
and the deaf all of whom require adjustments in traditional aa 
procedures 
talley was a pioneer in establishing support groups for 
alcoholics who are uncomfortable with aas spiritual path to 
sobriety 
id been to many meetings for a couple of years until i 
finally went out of there screaming talley recalls 
so talley with the help of atheist madalyn murray ohair and 
her network started his own alcoholic recovery group and called it 
aaarg american atheist addiction recovery groups 
he later changed the name of his organization to methods of 
moderation and abstinence moma because some people had trouble 
with the a atheist word he says 
talley who has a denver freelance advertising consulting 
business has used his own money to keep his organization going 
its growth has been slow but steady but talley says his business 
is dying because of the stigma of being an atheist im 
running out of money its been a struggle 
in succeeding years other groups have been organized including 
secular organization for sobriety or sos started by james 
christopher in california and rational recovery rr started by 
jack trimpey also in california 
the most recent and possibly the bestorganized is the 
international association of secular recovery organizations 
founded by stanley endick at lauderdale by the sea fla 
they have far fewer members than aa which reports several 
million worldwide but they are growing talley estimates about 
15000 or more people are tied to moma and that sos and rr are 
approaching that number talley says moma is now in 89 major 
cities every state and seven countries 
talleys argument against aa goes beyond religion 
in aa they say if you think you are an alcoholic then you 
are but maybe youre not maybe youre just a drinker 
in our groups youre encouraged not only to diagnose yourself 
sensibly based on modern psychological principles but also to see 
a professional he says see what he thinks 
but talley concedes that aa works for many even though i 
dont accept their premise that this is a progressive terminal 
disease for everyone he says i accept the premise that its 
going to be terminal for some 
talley quotes studies that show a few people can learn to 
moderate their use of alcohol 
besides iasro which is aimed at uniting the alternative groups 
endiuck also heads the steven danzinger foundation a 15bed 
inpatient program 
the foundation is supported by the mother of steven danzinger a 
36yearold addict who overdosed 2 years ago after dropping out of 
aa 
he want an atheist or agnostic endick says he was 
jewish he consistently objected to his mother about the overtly 
christian overtones his mother thought maybe if he had had an 
alternative he may have recovered 
trimpey a crisis intervention counselor who had alcohol 
problems of his own before establishing rational recovery says 
were trying to protect people from further exposure to aas 
doctrine of submissiveness and powerlessness which is very 
damaging to mental health 
trimpys group differs from other groups by encouraging the 
recovering alcoholic to leave the group eventually 
theres more to life than the constant fight to stay sober 
he says 
aa offers 12 steps to recovery from alcoholism including an 
admission that we were powerless over alcoholthat a power 
greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity 
an aa member in denver who identified himself as gary k said 
the power neednt be a theistic god 
the big book aas 575page bible says god as you 
understand him and each individual is free to find his or her own 
conception thats what separates aa from religion 
many use the group itself as the power many will seek the god 
of religion each individual is left to his or her own devices 
the alternative groups use some of the same methods but one of 
momas positions is that people can learn to use virtually all 
psychoactive substances with moderation abstinence however is 
preferred 
the alternative groups have variations of aas 12 steps one of 
momas ten criteria calls for a member to assume 
responsibility for ones own life though at times choosing to seek 
the help of others another calls on members to be objective 
rational and scientific and to apply the laws of logic and 
scientific method in daily living 
one of the 11 tenets of rational recovery states the idea 
that i need something greater than myself upon which to rely is 
only another dependency idea and dependency is my original 
problem 
aa has no opinion on alternative alcohol programs said gary 
k we try to be as inclusive as we can beas far as the 
alternative things we do not endorse anything but great if it 
works tell us about it our interest is solely recovery from 
alcoholism 
aa which is selfsupporting through contributions doesnt 
allow any one person to contribute more than 1000 a year gary k 
says 
talley doesnt have that problem 
out of all the mail ive got this week this is the only 
contribution he says holding up half a dozen postage stamps 
but im grateful for that 
he thinks eventually the alternative organizations will grow 
sufficiently to mount fundraising efforts and maybe pay a salary 
id love to have a fulltime staff cranking out literature 
handling inquiries writing articles crosspollinating with the 
other organizations he says

funerals help keep the henry clay hotel 
alive 
thats how bad business is at the 14room hotel that alma 
jarretts parents bought in their hometown 25 years ago 
most of the henry clays guests arent staying for pleasure 
some of them are motorists who just got lost 
usually the people who come in here are coming to do some kind 
of job or theyre here for a funeral mrs jarrett says 
the story is the same at thousands of small independent hotels 
and motels across the land they are being choked out by the big 
franchised operations 
the momandpops are dying says frank torres franchise 
coordinator of econo lodges of america based in charlotte nc 
you have a lot of independents that are feeling the pressure it 
might be a goodlooking property but the travelers are just not 
using them theyre finding they just need to tie in with 
someone 
travelers are reluctant to stay in motels they know little 
about says june farrell public relations director for the 
marriott corp of bethesda md 
when youre traveling you dont want any surprises she 
says the last thing you want to worry about is whether that room 
will be clean will the bed be lumpy you dont know what youre 
getting when youre not with a major chain 
mike mulvaney analyst for moodys investors service in new 
york says there are still a lot of independents to be found but 
theres a greater potential for success if youre part of a 
chain he says 
mulvaney says the roadside hotelmotel industry boomed in the 
early 1980s because of tax incentives that allowed investors to use 
the costs in building and opening a new motel as a shelter for 
capital gains in other investments 
the whole boom in construction has yet to be absorbed by the 
industry he says they were building these properties not 
because they needed a hotel at that specific location but for the 
tax writeoffs they would gain 
the restructuring of tax laws in 1988 put an end to the motel 
building craze he says 
besides the competition from national chains many independents 
such as the henry clay suffer from their location far off the 
interstate highway 
to reach the henry clay about 50 miles east of charleston 
guests must leave interstate 79 and drive about 15 miles on three 
different state highways the henry clay is not advertised outside 
of the clay county telephone book and in a state directory 
its also no vacation running the place 
we stay here seven days a week 24 hours a day mrs jarrett 
says its been four years since i had a vacation 
another woman helps out in the adjacent restaurant when things 
are hectic and arthur jarrett alma jarretts husband works for 
extra money at a nearby garage 
the motels countrystyle restaurant is open from about 530 
am until about 9 pm 
the restaurant cant make it without the hotel and the hotel 
cant make it without the restaurant mrs jarrett says 
the noon hour is crowded at the restaurant and regulars often 
come by for a hot dog or some conversation throughout the day 
you know how many hot dogs you have to sell to pay a 1000 
electric bill mrs jarrett asks 
things were better in the 70s when coal was more profitable and 
the nearby mines were busier 
wed change the beds and let a mining crew sleep then wed 
change the beds again and let another crew in she says 
guests pay only 10 a night for a single or 15 a night for a 
double but credit cards are not accepted because mrs jarrett says 
she cant afford the credit card fee 
at the henry clay theres no money for advertising or for 
tollfree reservations numbers to help draw customers from other 
areas and to help compete with the franchised motels 
the changing face of marketing is making it difficult for the 
average momandpop to compete in the marketplace today says ms 
farrell of marriott unless you have a major national name you 
have a very very hard time being an independent hotel operator 
but the small motel is not going to disappear from the roadside 
ms farrell says 
theres always a traveler somewhere in the market who likes 
the small the oneofakind she says i think the momandpop 
operator is going to have to be a lot more clever about his 
product 
they may have to affiliate with a chain in some fashion 
theyre going to have to forget about the old ways of doing 
business they just may have to compete differently 
when some momandpop motels cant beat the chains they join 
them 
george crompton and his wife margaret are new econo lodge 
franchise owners in sturbridge mass after 18 years as 
independents 
it was becoming a problem because everyone else my size in 
town had become members of one chain or another 
downtown motels sometimes referred guests to the cromptons 
motel when they were filled up he says but that was happening 
less often 
crompton moved to the boston area in 1968 from liverpool 
england to work as a mechanical engineer but quit after six years 
to move to the countryside about 60 miles west of boston they 
built the hotel from 11 rooms in 1972 to 48 rooms today 
crompton said it was too soon to know whether the econo lodge 
name was going improve business 
joining a chain costs big money torres says an econo lodge 
franchise costs 20000 
the money gives motel owners the right to use the econo lodge 
name and buys the services of corporate advisors who help the 
owners with training and orientation 
a new econo lodge motel also pays 65 percent of gross room 
receipts as a royalty to the corporation and for marketing torres 
says the corporation then provides national advertising 
billboards and a tollfree reservations number 
there are about 600 econo lodge franchises operating now and 
about 100 more motels are under contract torres says 
motel owners wanting to buy the chains name must meet certain 
standards 
torres says they should be a twostory building with 50 or more 
rooms rooms must average 12 feet by 24 feet and at least 75 
percent of the rooms must have a shower and tub combination instead 
of just showers 
motels with less than 20 rooms cannot qualify even for the 
lowestbudget franchises such as friendship inn which is owned by 
econo lodges torres says

this time novelist jackie collins cant whine 
about the way some screenwriter handled her work 
collins wrote her own screenplay for the threepart drama 
jackie collins luckychances scheduled for sunday monday 
and tuesday on nbc its taken from two books that follow the lives 
of gino santangelo and his daughter lucky 
i wanted to get involved because i hate writers who whine 
about how their works treated said collins who recalls an 
unhappy experience when her novel hollywood wives was given to 
other writers for a miniseries in 1985 
this time she was not going to stand by and see another writer 
adapt her two novels for the 6hour miniseries based on lucky 
and chances 
im pleased and i think i captured its humor and vitality 
she says i cant whine to anybody because i did it 
this is more fun than hollywood wives that miniseries was 
not like the book at all hollywood wives had 12 major stars all 
playing the wrong roles they had angie dickinson as the agent to 
cast her as a woman who couldnt get a date was ridiculous 
collins says that for luckychances she had an equal hand in 
casting with executive producer susan baerwald and director buzz 
kulik 
vincent irizarry stars as gino a tough street kid who builds an 
empire that includes las vegas casinos nicollette sheridan stars 
as lucky who threatens to take it all away from him 
the glitzy miniseries awash with passion and intrigue in the 
sundrenched haunts of the rich and powerful also stars annemarie 
johnson michael nader eric braeden stephanie beacham mary 
frann leann hunley david mccallum sandra bullock phil morris 
harold p pruett audrey landers tim ryan luca bercovici and 
shawnee smith 
collins latest book lady boss in which lucky santangelo 
takes over the last privately owned movie studio is also 
attracting attention as a possible miniseries on nbc 
collins has spent the last 20 years writing about sex love 
beautiful people and exotic locations she writes from the inside 
she is the sister of television vamp joan collins who recently 
wrote her own best seller 
jackie collins husband oscar lerman is owner of the tramp 
club in london thats where i got all the wonderful gossip for 
rock star my last book before lady boss she says 
as for her sister she says joan lives in france and i only 
see her when i get to europe were the best of friends contrary 
to popular belief 
despite an abundance of sex in her books collins contends 
thats not what makes them best sellers 
theyre not successful because theyre lusty she says 
sex alone doesnt sell believe me i think theyre successful 
because of the humor theyre a great sendup people do read them 
for other reasons but my true fans read them for the humor they 
also love a good story good relationships and good characters 
collins says she still writes the oldfashioned way i write 
with a pen in a book she says i write 10 to 12 pages a day 
my secretary puts them on the word processor and i make the 
changes 
she contends that luckychances which begins in the 1930s 
is based on reality 
youre not getting the front pages of the tabloids she 
says youre getting the truth but im protecting the innocent 
its an american drama of a street kid who rises to fame he looks 
around to see who the heroes of the day are and theyre gangsters 
he becomes a gangster with a heart of gold and he has a daughter 
who becomes his rival 
the books have all the ingredients of the genre the prostitute 
who becomes a society lady the son from the secret liaison the 
greek shipping magnate and the woman who marries for money and 
gets it all when her husband suddenly dies 
the miniseries will be up against the american and national 
league baseball playoff games on cbs the games sunday and tuesday 
will be played in prime time on the east coast 
am i nervous being up against the playoffs she says 
whos going to watch baseball when you can have nicollette 
sheridan 
collins who has published 13 books including several best 
sellers says she began writing at the age of 8 
i made up stories she says its like when you were 
around the campfire and told stories i was thrown out of school a 
15 for waving to the resident flasher and i smoked in my school 
uniform and was truant a lot i had a lot of adventures you have 
to have adventures to be able to write i was a wild child and when 
i started to write in my 20s i knew plenty 
i find it interesting that so many people try to copy my work 
they think if youre a woman and goodlooking you can write they 
dont realize the amount of work that goes into it

timberlake wertenbakers new play our 
countrys good is taking the regional theater circuit by storm 
the drama celebrates a reallife event the first theatrical 
performance in australia that was in 1789 when a group of english 
convicts staged george farquhars early 18thcentury comedy the 
recruiting officer 
does that sound unpromising and esoteric not to the london 
critics who cheered when our countrys good premiered at the 
royal court theater in 1988 and later won the olivier award for 
play of the year and not to artistic directors on the regional 
theater circuit in the united states and in canada they have made 
it one of the mostproduced new plays of this season 
our countrys good had its american premiere last fall at 
the mark taper forum in los angeles and then in april it was done 
at the remains theater in chicago the repertory theater in st 
louis has just finished a production while hartford stage in 
connecticut has a version directed by mark lamos now running 
other productions are planned for the new american theater in 
rockford ill the oregon shakespeare festival in portland 
californias berkeley repertory theater and a contemporary theater 
in seattle in canada there will be productions in edmonton 
montreal and halifax this season 
the play has wonderful insights into the ideas of making 
theater and thats always interesting to people like me says 
lamos artistic director at hartford stage where the play is on 
view through nov 3 on a larger level its about the power of 
education how education can transform peoples lives 
our countrys good originally was inspired by the 
playmaker a novel by australian writer thomas keneally 
it would be unfair to the novel to say that the play is an 
adaptation wertenbaker said in a telephone interview from a new 
hampshire vacation retreat there are characters that dont 
appear in the novel and the plot is slightly changed 
the keneally book was brought to her in london by max 
staffordclark who runs the royal court that shrine of modern 
british drama which first gave the world such classics as john 
osbornes look back in anger 
i said i wouldnt adapt the playmaker but i would be very 
interested in doing something on the same subject the playwright 
recalled 
wertenbaker used the novel as well as the fatal shore a 
history of an australian penal colony by robert hughes as the 
takingoff points for her play she also did a lot of research at 
the british museum into the journals of the reallife main 
character an idealistic lieutenant who directed the convicts in 
the farquhar comedy 
wertenbaker and the actors who eventually were cast in the play 
at the royal court also interviewed former prisoners who were 
involved in theater 
what interested me was the notion of the redemptive power of 
theater which is in the novel and i suppose was something i 
believed in anyway the playwright said we would ask them 
about what theater had meant to them they had found a great deal 
of freedom by being involved in theater during their prison 
sentences 
our countrys good is a big play 22 characters and 22 
scenes 
i wanted to follow quite a lot of characters wertenbaker 
said and thats always difficult to construct to keep the 
characters straight and to keep their stories going throughout the 
play 
wertenbaker wrote the play under deadline pressure it already 
had been scheduled to open and run in repertory with a revival of 
the recruiting officer with the same actors appearing in both 
plays 
so we had to work very fast in rehearsals she recalled i 
was getting up at 5 oclock in the morning to rewrite and i would 
bring in a scene which they would then rehearse that morning it 
was quite something 
wertenbaker went to connecticut briefly in midseptember to 
attend rehearsals of our countrys good at hartford stage and 
to answer any questions the american actors might have about her 
play 
wertenbaker did encourage the american actors not to use strong 
18thcentury accents 
we dont really known what 18thcentury accents were like 
anyway she said the play is not written in a lot of local 
dialects im a modern playwright ive just given some rhythms to 
certain characters actors should just use their natural voices and 
accents and then push it a little bit 
wertenbaker is more guarded about her private life than she is 
about her public writing 
the playwright has described herself as an 
anglofrenchamerican who lives in north london grew up in the 
south of france and went to school in the united states 
wertenbaker had her first play produced in 1983 since 1984 she 
has been a resident writer at the royal court earning recognition 
there with a play called the grace of mary traverse she has 
also had works done by the royal shakespeare company 
right now shes laboring on a new play commissioned by the 
royal court no details were revealed but she did say her deadline 
is december 
i sit down every day she said i have a little study in 
the back of my house that looks out over a garden i have privacy 
i take very precise notes the scene whos in the scene 
what they are doing in the scene i do that in longhand then i 
write on a word processor but i dont write dialogue until the 
last minute not until everything else is sorted out in the 
scene

in an open field in the center of berlin a 
low mound of debris over adolf hitlers fuehrer bunker rises 
near traces of the berlin wall the rubble of germanys bitter 
past 
neither is a monument no bronze plaques instruct visitors how 
to think about the mingled symbols of the fascist german reich and 
the cold war division of europe 
yet the questions they pose about the future are now rising as 
the lens of history tries to keep pace with the leap to unity of 
east and west germany on oct 3 recreating a country of almost 80 
million people by far the largest in europe 
the new germany like it or not will have to prove again and 
again that it is different because in being big rich and 
powerful it will look somewhat like the bad old germany 
a halfcentury ago german militarism already carrying a long 
history of making trouble for germanys neighbors forced 
blitzkrieg on europe invasion the bombing of cities occupation 
captive people and holocaust death camps to exterminate jews all 
sprang from germany 
world war ii is useful to remember said nicholas ridley a 
few months ago in the interview that led to his resignation as 
britains trade and industry secretary 
germans today are uppity ridley said they are taking over 
europe by economic power and he thought a lot of people in europe 
agreed with him 
ridley exited the political stage and the fuss was only a ripple 
in the headlong rush to unify germany yet it served as a reminder 
of the resentment germany has earned repeatedly since bismark 
united the germans under the prussian flag in 1871 
theres ample evidence that germany is conscious of a need to 
work off the evil legacies of the past 
west germany has paid 52 billion to the state of israel and to 
survivors of the holocaust there are numerous public monuments to 
the victims of naziism and memorials at deathcamp sites 
still some germans are tired of thinking about it 
germans want to be glad they dont want to walk around 
stressed confronted from morning till evening with the burden of 
history chancellor helmut kohl told british journalist david 
marsh of the financial times 
west german author patrick sueskind wrote in the weekly der 
spiegel of his confusion on seeing kohl raise a toast auf 
deutschland to germany after negotiations in moscow 
sueskind hadnt ever heard anyone toast germany and what sprang 
to his mind was auschwitz and the war 
but thats not what the chancellor meant sueskind wrote 
he didnt have the old aggressive germany in mind but rather 
the present and future germany peaceful civilized bound up into 
europe 
will the united germany be up to the political standards of the 
emerging new world order the 61 million west germans have had 45 
years experience in democracy but the 166 million east germans 
languished since the war under a communist police state many 
collaborated most were passive few resisted they werent told 
much about the holocaust 
we had to have a crash course in democracy says tino 
schwierzina who became mayor of east berlin last spring as east 
germany held its first free elections i think weve done a good 
job 
yet east german political life has been about as chaotic as the 
east german economy since the peaceful revolution in the fall of 
1989 twelve of 22 cabinet members have quit or been fired due to 
incompetence political strife or because of alleged ties to the 
oncedreaded stasi secret police organization 
the poison in the stasis 6 million files will still haunt the 
country after unification 
how hard should the police seek out those who committed crimes 
under orders from east germanys communist bosses 
can murder prosecutions be brought against those who killed 
approximately 200 people trying to cross the east germanwest 
german border including the berlin wall in the 28 years it stood 
before last nov 9 
such issues are only a few of many facing the germans after they 
vote on whether to stay with kohls centerright government or go 
for oskar lafontaines leftist social democrats 
other big domestic issues 
rebuilding substandard industry and infrastructure in the east 
and other costs of unification may require the government and 
private sector to invest an estimated 775 billion over five years 
says elmar pieroth an economics expert from kohls party the 
christian democratic union 
social subsidies will be crucial to retain the good will of 
east germans said gerhard behrendt an undersecretary in the east 
german environment ministry like many behrendt doesnt know if he 
will have a job after unification 
it was common to have two workers in a family and you got 
only an average living standard he said if production 
decreases now and jobs disappear someone must still earn money 
but how 
the east germans may have 2 million unemployed soon as one 
enterprise after another collapses west germany is a luxuryloving 
land where incomes are more than double the 765 a month reported 
in east germanys official but dubious statistics 
west germans are cruising through east germany in their bmws 
looking to reclaim family properties confiscated decades ago by the 
communists the prospect of wealthy west germans ousting jobless 
easterners from lowrent housing highlights the trouble looming for 
the next government over the disparity between east and west german 
living standards 
money indeed will be an issue west germany is rich but can 
it afford all that reconstruction money and 95 billion to moscow 
to finance the withdrawal of 370000 soviet troops from east 
germany and 3 billion for the persian gulf crisis 
a flood of refugees is testing how different todays germany is 
from the fascist one that created a flood of refugees leaving 
germany a stream of soviet jews applying to come to germany is of 
great historical irony perhaps true to historical form the bonn 
government has temporarily halted processing of applications from 
jews citing an apparently unmanageable wave with 10000 applicants 
in kiev alone 
this year west germany expects a record 120000 asylum 
applicants and 50 percent more next year 
the refugees and guest workers from turkey and southern 
europe have changed the face of germany especially in the cities 
germany today is a cosmopolitan mixture of turks yugoslavs blacks 
and asians with their own bakeries restaurants and for the turks 
a tv channel in their language 
east germanys environment in worse shape than the wests was 
poisoned by industries that were competitive only because they 
burned cheap foul brown coal and dumped untreated wastes into 
rivers the cleanup bill will be enormous 
one of the hottest topics in berlin can be identified as 
berlin as the future european metropolis 
now a city of 3 million spacious berlin will become the german 
capital bonn was always west germanys interim capital 
berlin is where the heart of the new germany beats strongest 
where unity came in the heady rush of a popular and peaceful 
rebellion last autumn 
from an isolated capitalist island in a sea of communists 
berlin has become a symbol of hope it will be the major european 
city between paris and moscow a gateway to the eastern neighbors 
who were inspired to push aside communist governments after the 
east germans showed that their regime was a paper tiger

some of the east germans who helped open the 
door to german unity are reluctant to step inside 
dissident professor peter boethig fled the country just a few 
months before its remarkable transformation to a free nation now 
that hes back hes not sure he belongs 
katje havemann endured house arrest for more than two years and 
fought a lonely fight for change long before huge crowds joined her 
on the streets now that the communists have been overthrown 
havemann presses on with protests against the new government 
carl ordnung works for that government which won east germanys 
first free elections by promising fast capitalism and quick unity 
but ordnung now worries about a rise in nationalism and consumer 
fever and says his nation has shifted too far to the right 
the three are by no means typical of most east germans who 
passively endured four decades of sovietimposed rule then quickly 
embraced a fast merger with west germany 
but each to varying degrees took part in what east germany is 
now a sovereign nation with a democratic government 
and each feels in some way opposed to what it will soon 
become a transplanted territory of west germany 
in the beginning i was angry boethig said it was a pity 
a basic democratic movement was overtaken by a unification 
movement the sudden materialism the nationalism 
but i can imagine now why they wanted what they wanted 
the 32yearold berliner taught german literature at east 
berlins prestigious humboldt university and quickly moved into 
circles actively opposed to the old communist government he edited 
an underground literary journal from 198488 working with writers 
barred from official publications 
one day the secret police came to the university and said i 
had to go boethig said after i left i couldnt find a job i 
drove cabs worked in construction i realized i would have to do 
that for a long time 
he applied to leave and like many people considered 
troublemakers was granted a visa in march 1989 six months later 
he got a job teaching german at the university of pittsburgh 
two months after that his former colleagues were leading 
nationwide demonstrations the communist government convulsed and 
collapsed 
in may he came back to work with a west berlin literary society 
the east already had been transormed the university invited 
boethig back to complete his doctoral dissertation 
he plans to accept but finds little in common with east germany 
today the issues his old activist friends are involved with seem 
remote the consumerism of the freed society saddening 
i had mixed feelings after i returned he said what will 
dominate the next years is germany will be busy with itself 
while boethig spoke last week katje havemann was doing what she 
did a decade ago waging war on the government this time the new 
government 
mrs havemann is one of east germanys most lionized activists 
her husband robert a philosophy professor renounced the 
government in the 1970s and became its most famous dissident 
the havemanns spent 2 years under house arrest their home 
surrounded by secret police 
he died in 1982 and she carried on to help form new forum the 
activist group that led the autumn revolt 
mrs havemann was among 22 activists who occupied the 
headquarters of the former secret police sept 4 to keep the files 
from being turned over to west germanys intelligence service 
the group went on a hunger strike sept 12 
many people are concerned now with their social problems 
she said referring to the joblessness that followed the nations 
plunge into capitalism 
but she said she said she fears the united german government 
would become too much like the old communist government if it took 
control of the 6 million secret dossiers of the old administration 
she said she sees no problem with the small crowds that attend 
new forums rallies these days compared with the hundreds of 
thousands last year 
the big difference between now and last fall last fall has 
already happened she said 
new forum never came up with a clear program for a future east 
germany but the christian democrats an approved party by the 
communists reshaped itself after their powerful west german 
namesakes 
the christian democrats espoused conservatism and unencumbered 
capitalism quick unity and western lifestyles they won the free 
elections handily 
carl ordnung 62 joined the party in 1951 and helped reshape it 
last year to fit the new era 
he now works as a foreign policy adviser to prime minister 
lothar de maiziere and will like the government be out of work 
oct 3 
but ordnung a methodist lay preacher said the party and nation 
have swung too far to the right 
he had hoped for a socialist democracy more sympathetic to poor 
people and foreigners less devoted to a marketdriven economy 
i hope east germans after they have consumed western goods 
will see that to consume is not all of human life he said 
ordnungs life has paralleled east germanys he was married 
four days before the nation was created and will celebrate his 41st 
anniversary the day it dissolves 
he was a german army conscript at the end of world war ii and 
went home to recuperate after he was injured in a training 
accident his mother burned his uniform before the soviets came 
he enjoyed travel privileges because of his role in church 
circles but his son then 16 was imprisoned for 2 years in 1973 
for trying to flee 
ordnung believed germanys division was gods penalty for two 
world wars unification he said is a result of public will 
you should respect the will of the people he said but we 
should remember there is another world besides germany

by the time ronnie mutimusekwa was 15 he 
was sleeping regularly with three different girls a few years 
later the number had grown to 15 and he was proud to think any 
woman he asked would go to bed with him 
i guess i made sex a hobby said the 34yearold 
a deadly hobby 
mutimusekwa from zimbabwes southern city of bulawayo 
contracted aids he does not know who gave it to him nor does he 
know who may have caught it from him 
behavior like his has contributed to the rapid spread of the 
disease in africa and has helped make the continent the aids 
center of the world 
twothirds of the worlds estimated aids cases are in africa 
and most of those are concentrated in about 12 countries across the 
continents central eastern and southern regions 
the problem only threatens to get worse according to medical 
experts infection rates unlike those in most other areas of the 
world are rising in africa if current trends continue millions 
of african infants will be born with the deadly disease and 
africas population growth rate now the worlds highest will be 
cut as aids kills those in what should be the most productive time 
of their lives 
the genevabased world health organizaton estimates that in 
subsaharan africa one of every 40 adult men and women is infected 
with the hiv virus that causes aids in the united states which 
has recorded about half the worlds known cases of aids one of 
every 75 men and 700 women has hiv who estimates 
because of underrecognition underreporting and delays in 
reporting who estimates only a fraction of the worlds cases of 
aids and hiv have been recorded 
as of mid1990 about 65000 aids cases had been reported from 
africa but who estimates closer to 500000 adult aids cases 
probably exist more than half the estimated global total 
in what it calls a conservative estimate the organization says 
5 million africans may be hiv carriers 
aids and hiv are becoming more and more a disease of the 
developing world said michael merson whos antiaids chief in 
a telephone interview from geneva by the year 2000 we expect 80 
percent of the cases to be in the developing world 
the organization says about 20 million cases worldwide are 
expected by the end of the century 
merson includes latin america when he speaks of aids and the 
developing world but who statistics show the severity of the 
disease in africa far outstrips any other continent 
today aids is the leading cause of death among young adults in 
many african countries said merson 
the average african victim however differs from his american 
or european counterpart who is usually a homosexual or an 
intravenous drug user in africa most aids casualties are 
heterosexuals because of this the number of women infected 
roughly equals the number of men 
and because many of the infected women are in their prime hiv 
transmission from mother to child is an increasing problem 
already this year about 500000 children carrying the hiv virus 
have been born in africa says who the organization estimates an 
additional 2 million to 3 million infected infants will be born 
before the year 2000 another 10 million children born to infected 
mothers but who will not contract the disease are expected to 
become aidsrelated orphans in the 1990s says who 
dambudzo a 26yearold unemployed zimbabwean lost a 2yearold 
daughter to the disease the divorcee said she learned she had aids 
while still in the hospital after delivering her baby 
i was really hurt because the baby had also contracted the 
disease and whenever she was brought in for breastfeeding i would 
look at her and cry dambudzo told ziana zimbabwes news agency 
dambudzos husband also tested positive for the disease but 
rather than engage in safer habits she said he stopped sleeping 
with her and started bringing other women home to bed 
such negligent promiscuity as well as a tradition of polygamy 
among many african peoples a high incidence of other sexually 
transmitted diseases particularly those that create sores and 
centuriesold customs are encouraging aids spread 
in zambia for instance where 3000 aids cases have been 
recorded but many times that are believed to exist a custom among 
the kaonde tribe demands that when a man dies a male relative must 
sleep with the widow to exorcise ghosts 
enough people will be dying of aids in the next 10 years that 
african population growth rates the highest in the world are 
expected to slow says who beyond the year 2000 if current trends 
continue populations could even decline according to the un 
organization 
already along the eastwest corridor of countries from kenya to 
ivory coast the hardesthit west african country villages are 
being decimated by the virus 
in southeastern uganda where the majority of that countrys 
aids cases have been recorded residents of rakai said as many as 
six people were dying daily by 1988 
fred ssonko manager of a local hotel said at the time he was 
going to burials almost every afternoon 
the 35yearold took on the extra care of eight children he 
adopted after his brother and his best friend died of the illness 
while education and awareness programs have changed behavior and 
slowed the rate of new infections in europe and america the rates 
are increasing at an alarming rate in african and other third 
world countries according to who 
despite internationallyfunded aids prevention programs 
throughout the continent africa still lacks the resources to mount 
educational campaigns that reach all its 500 million people 
we know that a lot of people know about hiv and aids but we 
dont know enough yet about getting their behavior to change 
said merson 
we want to get safer sexual practices and more condoms used 
he said and its very important to treat other sexually 
transmitted diseases 
however even some of those most at risk and who are easily 
accessible still dont believe aids is a real threat 
surveys have found that 60 percent to 80 percent of the 
prostitutes in some large east and central african cities are 
infected with hiv 
however in kenyas capital nairobi some prostitutes 
interviewed recently by a local paper said they thought the figures 
were just propaganda for governmentbacked family planning 
programs 
one aids prevention program being run by the nairobibased 
african medical and research foundation amref is targeting a 
highly vulnerable population that health workers credit with 
fueling the virus spread longdistance truckers 
since the disease first was recorded in africa in 1983 medical 
researchers have found aids spreading most quickly along trucking 
routes with a high incidence of cases at popular roadside stops 
through southern eastern and central africa 
amref is distributing free condoms to the local prostitutes 
there and to drivers who frequent them as well as handing out 
pamphlets that explain aids causes and symptoms the material 
urges the truckers to refrain from casual sex 
ominously while aids used to be concentrated primarily in urban 
areas along major roads it is now appearing in rural areas where 
an estimated 75 percent of the population lives 
it means the epidemic is continuing to rise and africa is 
being confronted by a major problem said merson it is nowhere 
near its peak

glory rcacolumbia vhsbeta rated r 
 
on july 18 1863 despite fatigue and poor rations the 54th 
massachusetts colored volunteer infantry marched across a halfmile 
of sand on a south carolina beach to lead the illplanned attack on 
fort wagner in charleston harbor the regiment lost more than 40 
percent of its men 
the story of the 54th the first black regiment from the north 
to fight in the civil war and its youthful white colonel robert 
gould shaw unfolds in glory edward zwicks critically 
acclaimed movie 
zwick presents a powerful moving tapestry of wars 
senselessness the screenplay by kevin jarre is partly based on the 
books lay this laurel and one gallant rush and letters 
shaw wrote home to his parents the movie narrated by matthew 
broderick as shaw is largely seen through his eyes 
young and privileged but disillusioned and battlescarred after 
the gory and indecisive battle of antietam shaw returns to his 
wealthy powerful and abolitionist parents in massachusetts just in 
time for a lavish party and an offer from the governor to take 
command of an allblack fighting regiment 
he rises in rank from captain to colonel and musters his men 
who include his childhood friends cabot cary elwes who is white 
and becomes a major and tom andre braugher a secondgeneration 
free black who volunteers as an enlisted man 
much of glory focuses on the basic training of a ragtag 
group of runaway slaves and free men who are asked to accept less 
pay than whites and denied all the basic supplies including proper 
shoes and the coveted blue uniform 
as trip an embittered runaway denzel washington cry 
freedom the mighty quinn power does a star turn 
glory becomes trips story as well as shaws as the runaway 
undergoes a radical selfrealization in the end the 54th becomes 
the only family hes ever known 
zwick the emmyaward winning director of special bulletin 
and thirtysomething stresses visual acting in glory 
action speaks louder than words and he focuses on facial 
expressions and body movement rather than histrionics and gimmicks 
he also is spare with dialogue when the 54th marches past the 
white regiments who regarded the black soldiers as a joke and less 
than men to lead the assault against fort wagner only four words 
are spoken by the once hostile whites give em hell 54 
ultimately color no longer is the issue the men are fellow 
soldiers about to die and like gallipoli and hamburger 
hill the overriding issue becomes the utter futility of war 
the battle scene at fort wagner is beautifully choreographed 
the men running along the beach the us flag full and billowing 
it is poetic and powerful 
glory makes good use of battle scenes they are exciting 
frightening and realistic at james island the 54th gets its first 
taste of fighting after firing a few rounds and watching a 
confederate unit retreat more confederates appear through the mist 
like gray ghosts and the battle soon becomes handtohand combat 
dan lerner was second unit director and bob minor coordinated the 
stunts 
there are good performances by morgan freeman street smart 
driving miss daisy jihmi kennedy as a stuttering enlisted man 
and john finn as the fierce nononsense irish sergeantmajor who 
whips the 54th into shape braugher whose theater credits include 
much ado about nothing and king john at the new york 
shakespeare festival makes his film debut in glory and is

boy how can you criticize a movie that tries to teach the value 
of literacy stars jane fonda and robert deniro and even plans to 
donate part of its video proceeds to help people learn to read 
well for all the good it might do stanley amp iris is just 
sort of sappy too bad because it has a great cast which also 
includes swoosie kurtz and martha plimpton 
the actors do their best to play down the melodrama that 
intrudes at every turn iris king fonda tough and newly widowed 
chases a guy who snatched her purse and gets in a fight iris 
supports her unemployed and battling sister and brotherinlaw 
iris daughter gets pregnant while in high school stanley gets 
fired because he cant read because he has no job he has to put 
his elderly father in a home where the man soon dies you get the 
idea 
based on the novel union street by pat barker stanley amp 
iris has some nice moments including the convivial scenes of 
iris and her coworkesr on a bakery assembly line and the romance 
that grows in fits and starts between stanley and iris as she lets 
him into her life and teaches him to read 
director martin ritt filmed stanley amp iris in waterbury 
conn where veterans groups demonstrated in protest of fondas 
presence because of her work against the vietnam war

never too much mca records henry johnson 
with his third mca record guitarist henry johnson says he is 
trying to fill the void between strictly commercial music and 
straightahead jazz that is more void than any one musician could 
fill but johnson makes a good attempt 
punched up drums and percussion keyboard overlays and some 
rather bland arrangements give this record its commercial feel 
johnson is able to break free from those constraints often enough 
to keep things interesting listening to the chicagoborn johnson 
it is clear he is capable of making much more interesting 
challenging music 
even so never too much is a cut above the new age elevator 
music so prevalent today on the airwaves and in the record bins

four impromptus d 935 12 landler d 790 three klaverstucke 
d946 allegretto d 915 by franz schubert london andras 
schiff piano 
the best of schuberts smallscale piano pieces belong to that 
special category of art works which are simple in form yet truly 
complex in experience because of the way they touch us so deeply 
many of domenico scarlattis keyboard sonatas have this quality 
nothing perhaps has it more than schuberts impromptus 
andras schiff has recorded both for london most recently the 
four opus 142 impromptus on this disc 
schiff has all the right instincts in his choice of recording 
repertoire great taste and also adventurousness as shown by 
last years issue of him playing dohnanyi chamber music and 
dvoraks piano concerto performed live 
on the schubert disc his technique is wonderful his approach 
sensitive his interpretations well thoughtout even the disc 
booklet is appealingly simple in its layout and notes 
so mainly in the impromptus one misses all the more that extra 
quality of bringing us into a special realm that focus on the 
depth of simple works 
in the aflat imprompu for instance the middle section is a 
marvel of lyricisim with a lowerupper register dialogue 
accompanied by an excruciatingly beautiful harmonic progression 
but schiff handles the passage without extraordinary poignancy 
nevertheless he manages moments of charm and poetry at other 
times 
the recorded sound is fair schiffs bosendorfer piano has a 
thudding quality at 7426 the cd is generously timed

under the red sky columbia bob dylan 
bob dylans under the red sky is a lot like dylans concerts 
of the last two years bob storms onstage and whales away at some 
surprisingly tough rock n roll and is gone before you know it if 
you catch a flash of brilliance great if not tough luck 
much of this album sounds simply haphazard as if dylan 
scribbled a few lyrics on a sheet of paper five minutes before 
entering the studio this master lyricist has become enamored of 
the somewhat lazy device of repeating key lyrical phrases over and 
over wiggle wiggle 10000 men and god knows by his 
own formidable standards this is minor work 
those flashes of brilliance are there however god knows 
has an elegance about it tv talkin song pokes wicked fun at 
the television generation television will scramble up your head 
and drag your brain about he sings sometimes you gotta do 
like elvis did and shoot the damn thing out 
when bob dylan calls musicians come running bruce hornsby 
jimmie and the late stevie ray vaughan george harrison elton 
john david crosby slash of guns n roses drummer kenny aronoff 
and don and david was consequently this album sounds 
simultaneously impeccably played and a loose good time

julie christie doesnt make many films these 
days and rarely sees her old movies 
she was thrilled to work with such directors as john schlesinger 
and sir david lean and amazed she had the courage to arrive on the 
set each day but dont expect her to recite dialogue from those 
movies 
now 49 and feeling much calmer the academy award winner and 
icon of 1960s swinging london prefers to think of the locations 
where she made the films theres india the setting for heat and 
dust canada where she made mccabe and mrs miller and 
ireland which provided christie with happy memories of the recent 
fools of fortune 
the irish are the most generous people the most wonderful 
people she said enthusiastically looking relaxed in a blue knit 
shirt her blond hair cheerfully uncombed a childrens birthday 
celebration goes on in another room of a friends manhattan 
apartment where christie stays when shes in town 
it makes you happy the touches of kindness that you get every 
single day it makes you happy to be there because people are so 
extraordinarily nice it sounds patronizing doesnt it the irish 
have an incredibly nice nature and they havent got an 
antienglish bias though they have every right to 
christie is very much the welltraveled performer veteran of 
stage screen and warren beatty even growing up home was 
whereever they built the set she was born in india but spent her 
childhood at a series of english boarding schools finding 
contentment by performing in school plays 
she lived for a year in paris and established herself in films 
in 1963 with a brief appearance in schlesingers billy liar 
christie topped it two years later by winning a best actress oscar 
for darling playing the shallow freespirited london model 
who tells her life story to a reporter for a womans magazine 
you just think they made a terrible mistake she said of the 
academy award you feel terrible because you cant believe its 
happening youre just thinking what am i doing there what the 
hell am i doing there 
for a long time i didnt put it anywhere a friend of mine had 
it i was too embarrassed by it what a stupid cow i was then i 
grew up a little bit more and thought wonderful look what ive 
got she said sounding just like a gleeful as kid who just 
found a 5 bill 
after starring as lara in dr zhivago christie traveled 
some more she lived in california during the 1970s and worked with 
beatty her boyfriend for several years and costar of shampoo 
heavan can wait and mccabe and mrs miller shot in 
vancouver british columbia 
mccabe was a wonderful location because director robert 
altman made it a wonderful location we were shooting nights in 
vancouver and it was where people who didnt want to go to the 
vietnam war went instead she said 
it was a very vital place a wonderful place all these people 
were living in the mountains very selfsufficient and robert got 
them to be the townspeople they built everything from day one 
some of them ended up living on the sets during the shooting 
she moved back to england at the end of the 70s became 
increasingly outspoken politically and traveled she made the 
acclaimed heat and dust returning to her native india and 
worked in argentina for miss mary a commercial flop but a 
personal success 
theres an interesting thing about being british and having 
come from an enormous empire country you go to countries like 
argentina which suffered appallingly from english imperialism they 
see someone from britain as a continuation of that imperialism i 
had to get over their reticence 
coming to the united states im aware of that same feeling the 
argentines had i get the same feeling of people feeling superior 
to everyone else just in little drops remarks here and there an 
attitude that people dont know as much in the backward countries 
its a superiority complex that all great empires have 
in fools of fortune based on the novel by william trevor 
christie plays the english wife of an irishman murdered by british 
military police during the irish republicans uprising after world 
war i mary elizabeth mastrantonio and iain glen also star 
christie takes an emotional trip in fools of fortune warm 
and outgoing at the beginning of the film embittered and 
increasingly unstable after her husbands murder 
if in person christie seems closer to the lifeaffirming woman 
of the films first half as an actress she related to the angry 
singleminded personality of the second half a world traveler 
unafraid to cross boundaries of any kind 
theres a scene thats missing which i wished had been in 
she said she talks to her son and explains her family had always 
been involved with the struggle for home rule for ireland she 
explains for a protestantenglish person that is an extremely 
unusual thing 
i identified with that anger and injustice her heartbreak and 
rage that the man who killed her husband was receiving no 
retribution at all what is it like to go through a transition like 
that woman went through you go through sort of a journey the work 
is really a journey

paintings splattered from a carbine by niki 
de st phalle or squashed cars hung as art by cesar may not be to 
everyones taste 
but the handsome new museum of contemporary art in the heart of 
the rivieras capital is nevertheless an impressive contribution to 
the city not least because of its monumental modern architecture 
the museum opened amid controversy in june boycotted by several 
local artists and frances culture minister jack lang 
conceived by nices longtime mayor jacques medecin the 
multimilliondollar museum and theater was financed mainly by the 
city with other funds coming from regional and national government 
sources 
the museum had a rough start because of medecins rightwing 
politics coupled with alleged financial fiddling that still have 
the mayor in hot water he was accused of antisemitic remarks last 
spring at a time when desecrations of jewish cemeteries in france 
and elsewhere were causing a storm of protest 
medecin is an avowed admirer of jeanmarie le pen whose 
farright national front espouses antiimmigrant causes that 
attitude is shared by many older conservatives enjoying the high 
life of nice 
perhaps more serious are allegations that medecin has cheated on 
personal taxes as well as in financial deals involving the city he 
is currently under investigation 
in any case the new museum daily is attracting about 1000 
visitors according to spokesmen 
i dont discuss controversy its in the past and im looking 
to the future said head curator pierre chaigneau an art expert 
who has helped open several other important museums and distances 
himself from politics 
he is proud of this museums strictly contemporary role in an 
area that already boasts some excellent museums nices museum of 
fine arts the national chagall museum there the prestigious 
maeght foundation at st paul de vence the leger musem at biot 
this is the only one dedicated exclusively to art from 1950 
onwards said chaigneau who personally favors geometric abstract 
works in the line of josef albers and max bill 
emphasizing neorealism from the 1960s pop art by such artists 
as warhol and lichtenstein as well as minimalist and other trends 
the museums displays include about 2025 percent of works by 
american artists 
the school of nice spearheaded by such artists as yves klein 
armand and martial raysse is wellrepresented the museum is 
especially proud of its large collection of kleins 
threedimensional electric blue figures on various backgrounds by 
the local artist who made international art news before his 
untimely death at age 34 in 1962 
but its the handsome museum complex itself of which nice can be 
most proud 
just behind the old city the gray carrara marblefaced 
structure designed by local architects yves bayard and henri vidal 
includes an octagonal theater and a plaza connecting with four 
monolithic towers housing the art on three levels 
access is easy by way of a redbrick staircase entrance flanked 
by escalators and entry is free of charge a rarity in france 
at the top of the staircase the visitor is dazzled by sun on 
marble and a handsome alexander calder stabile a gift by the 
artist to nice in 1970 
the towers are joined by corridors of glass and steel decorated 
on the interior by vaguely fishshaped metallic ellipses and hung 
with colorful metal stabiles 
in the towers are spacious welllighted exhibition rooms ideal 
for a handsome display of monumentalsized abstracts by such 
artists as morris louis frank stella or jim dine 
with a restaurant tucked into a corner facing the firstlevel 
plaza and theater and a little cafe at the top level the complex 
is equipped to become a gatheringplace for nicois and visitors 
from the top of the museum are fabulous views over old nice to 
the mediterranean a jewish cemetery and the green slopes of the 
cimiez area 
one of the rooftop areas contains a grid of gas jets constructed 
to an yves klein design that sparkles in the evening with jets of 
blue flame a little rooftop garden is planted with typically 
riviera succulents and flowers based on kleins notes for a dream 
garden 
while some nice residents leave quizzical remarks in the 
visitors book about the art the only real complaints so far seem 
to be from animallovers and pigeons apparently some pigeons died 
when stuck to the birdrepellent spread along the rooftop walls 
an unfortunate accident that were striving to correct said 
chaigneau

dressed in jeans and white tshirts calmly 
puffing marlboros marti jones and husband don dixon look as if 
they make records with all the urgency of vacuuming the living room 
carpet 
but they have plenty to worry about jones first three albums 
produced by dixon sold poorly despite mostly favorable reviews 
and the singer has switched record labels from aampm to rca hoping 
her luck will change 
with just a few pockets of popularity new york washington 
paying the bills disagreements can emerge on any kind of 
lie the arguments are in the lyrics themselves 
even talking about the record gets them going 
it was real easy jones insisted during an interview at the 
rca offices in manhattan we stayed home for about 2 months 
wed get up and dixon would be working on something and id be 
cleaning up the kitchen or wanting to do laundry or go see my 
mother or something 
and hed say i just want to work on this song and i knew 
when i came back if i didnt do something hed have it finished 
it took a long time countered dixon flicking an ash we 
started this record from scratch we were trying to figure out what 
to do the biggest difference in this record from martis other 
records is this is more groove based its a little bit more of a 
band record 
sometimes the only way to break through the jonesdixon line 
and get the whole story is to take their responses and split the 
difference in my tears are poison they make like sonny and 
cher in a trailer park tossing verbal pots and pans about money 
and television and pets and babies 
were like buddy and sally of the dick van dyke show 
jones said of the bickering scriptwriting team from the old 
television series when we would think of what to say on stage 
wed say what would they do now would she do this or she do 
that 
they met in the early 1980s when jones was struggling with a 
band called color me gone and dixon who had produced rem was 
called in to help color me gone soon fell apart but dixon was 
impressed with jones singing and suggested they work together 
thats when the trouble began 
we wrote through the mail recalled jones who lives with 
dixon in her native ohio and also spends time in charlotte nc 
i sent these lyrics to dixon and he called me and said i got 
your lyrics and on the way home from the post office i wrote the 
song which was called rhythm and shallow breathing i was real 
impressed i was like wow then i found out theres this old 
song he had and he just adapted it into this 
until any kind of lie they preferred to let others do the 
arguing cover versions of graham parkers you cant take love 
for granted and elvis costellos just a memory earned her 
respect among musicians and so did her willingness to perform 
songs by lesserknown writers such as dwight twilley and richard 
barone 
but after the 1988 album used guitars jones and dixon took 
a different approach before they wrote just two or three songs 
per record on any kind of lie only two of the 11 songs are 
nonoriginals 
jones gives two reasons they were unimpressed with the outside 
material submitted and after watching some socalled pros at work 
they figured some of their own songs might be salvageable 
with jones and dixon doing most of the writing any kind of 
lie has a more consistent sound than used guitars which 
ranges from the jazzy ruby to a folkish cover of john hiatts 
if i can love somebody 
how it sounds to jones and dixon depends on which one you ask 
again its buddy and sally time a battle of selective memories 
with jones leaning forward while she speaks and dixon preferring to 
recline 
jones i think this record is sort of the relaxed version of 
used guitars 
dixon used guitars is real atmospheric 
jones it is its more bouyant this is more mature 
dixon i think this is a real rock n roll album 
jones this is real relaxed i wasnt worried about the songs 
i wasnt worried about how it was going to turn out there was not 
a point where i was nervous dixon is shaking his head of 
course i was worried the way i sounded singing i completely 
freaked out

but sturges insisted directors were princes of the blood 
the ones who were really in charge by 1939 he was so anxious for 
a chance to direct he offered to accept a salary of 1 his 
screenplays usually brought him 30000 or more if he could make a 
film of down went mcginty a political satire he had written 
several years before paramount gave in even upping his pay to 
10 
i saved my strength i treated myself like an egg wrote 
sturges who gave up drinking and smoking in preparation for the 
film and as a result of this totally regular and totally 
unaccustomed manner of living on the 14th day of shooting i was 
rewarded with pneumonia 
sturges was convinced he had blown it but paramount executives 
were so happy with the scenes he had filmed so far they sent a 
messenger to the directors hospital bed to inform him they would 
wait indefinitely for his recovery 
my fever slid down like a monkey on a flagpole and i was back 
on the set in 10 days sturges wrote 
the great mcginty as it was eventually called was a hit 
and earned sturges an academy award in 1940 for the new category of 
best original screenplay and thanks to sturges frustrated writers 
such as john huston and billy wilder also were allowed to make 
films and became great directors themselves 
sturges made christmas in july sullivans travels 
the lady eve the palm beach story the miracle of 
morgans creek and hail the conquering hero during the next 
four years they are among the wittiest movies ever made and are 
included in a current film forum retrospective in new york 
deception or mistaken identity was often a theme in sturges 
movies in the lady eve barbara stanwyck plays a cardsharp 
then a phony british heiress eddie bracken is wrongly thought to 
be a war hero in conquering hero and dick powell falsely 
believes he has won a contest for writing a coffee slogan in 
christmas in july 
sturges a tall powerfully built man with wavy black hair and a 
thin mustache filmed in the afternoon played host at his 
nightclub in the evening and then wrote until the early morning he 
rarely knew where the story would go once he started and began 
filming morgans creek with just 10 pages of dialogue 
he loved working with mccrae stanwyck and claudette colbert 
but also cultivated a stock company of such motley mountebanks as 
the fumbling raymond walburn the eccentric jimmy conlin and the 
cranky william demarest who had featured parts in morgans 
creek and conquering hero 
but in 1943 after completing conquering hero sturges had a 
falling out with paramount and left to form a film company with the 
reclusive billionare howard hughes 
it was a disaster sturges made the poorly regarded the sin of 
harold diddlebock which hughes soon pulled from circulation and 
the partnership dissolved 
sturges never recovered unfaithfully yours released by fox 
in 1948 did poorly at the box office despite considerable 
publicity and the beautiful blonde from bashful bend fared 
even worse the following year 
unable to catch on with any of the studios sturges spent the 
last decade of his life watching deal after deal fall through 
reduced to minor acting roles and assisting on screenplays 
to sandy sturges his fatal heart attack in august 1959 just 20 
minutes after he had completed his autobiography still doesnt 
make sense he had three deals in the works and had been assured by 
a doctor three months earlier that he was in perfect health and

master guitarist chet atkins figures 
hes due for a new image 
the 66yearold softspoken music legend may start emulating 
certain rock stars by wearing leather and heavy makeup nobody 
wants you when you just play guitar he laments 
but hes not serious hes just joking around with dire straits 
guitarist mark knopfler his special guest on the new album neck 
and neck 
atkins hardly needs any special strategy at this stage of his 
career 
hes already earned the title mr guitar during his 45 years 
as an instrumentalist hes recorded more than 75 albums and sold 
in excess of 30 million records 
however on neck and neck atkins returns to the country 
music style he helped popularize even the presence of a rock n 
roller such as knopfler the producer of the album cant hide the 
country feel to it 
ive been making socalled jazz albums for the past three or 
four years atkins said in an interview in his music row office 
before heading to a golf course to pursue his hobby 
so in this album we got away from that and got back to more 
country sounding things for the most part mark thought i was going 
in the wrong direction lately 
in the lp they play and sing on such wellknown songs as 
therell be some changes made ill see you in my dreams 
and sweet dreams 
i think it will appeal to a lot of people around the world 
where marks fans are atkins said i dont know yet how it 
will be accepted in this country there seems to be a great deal of 
conformity in this country where they play the same things 
atkins has collaborated with top contemporary artists including 
george benson larry carlton earl klugh and les paul theres a 
reason 
its a lot easier because when i play i improvise he said 
i never play the same chorus twice so when im playing with 
someone he will play something that gives me a fresh idea 
if im playing by myself i might just fall back on cliches 
and play the same thing over and over but someone like mark plays 
licks that inspire me and gives stimulus to an idea i might come up 
with 
he describes knopfler now with the notting hillbillies as a 
distinctive guitarist 
he plays with his right hand and hes a left hander so he has 
a lot of strength in his left hand he can get a vibrato with three 
strings instead of one like most people because his hand is so 
strong atkins said 
hes a great noodler if you know what noodlin is he can 
improvise all over the place on and on 
atkins who has won eight grammy awards says he keeps doing 
albums in an eternal quest for perfection 
i never have gotten it right he says modestly about his 
playing i keep trying to improve and get it the way i want it 
and keep out the mediocrity and conformity 
i never listen to my records i hope i never get so i love to 
listen to myself i think thats one of the reasons ive been 
around so long because i dont like the way im doing i keep 
changing and playing a few new things so that i havent become 
entirely predictable to the average person out there 
atkins is renowned among musicians for refining the 
thumbandfinger picking technique in which the thumb plays the 
bass notes and keeps time while the fingers play the melody lines 
guitar player magazine has named him the most influential 
stylist in his field 
he has made important behindthescenes contributions to music 
too as the former head of rca records nashville division he was 
responsible for helping to sign and produce records for dozens of 
entertainers including elvis presley and dolly parton 
this summer he did an 18city tour dubbed the sweet corn 
show with prairie home companion creator garrison keillor 
never one to enjoy life without a project in the works atkins 
will begin production soon on his next album fingerpickin 
with longtime pal jerry reed

for a nation that extols the virtues of living 
within your income theres an awful lot of borrowing going on 
enough to christen the 1980s a bit belatedly as the decade of 
deep debt 
and perhaps not prematurely to call the decade of the 
1990s the time in which the bills came due the wreckage assessed 
and an effort made to clear accounts and get the economy back on 
the straight and narrow 
the phenomenon is a living presence in millions of american 
households in the form of credit cards and other installment 
credit automobile loans home mortgages education loans broker 
loans 
and at work american corporations took on more debt in the 
1980s than anyone ever imagined before since 1983 about 500 
billion worth of equities have been removed from the market most 
of it replaced by debt 
and in government the federal government has been running up 
annual deficits for two decades and despite an interestrate 
burden that is now one of its biggest budget items it will 
continue to borrow for years 
many state and municipal governments too are in a deepdebt 
state and some are facing crises that cannot be exaggerated new 
york is only recently resurrected from nearbankruptcy but some 
other cities are heading toward it 
about 2 billion of governmentbacked student loans appear 
uncollectable the insurance fund protecting commercial loan 
deposits might need help savings and loans losses are at 130 
billion and may head higher 
taxpayers eventually will pay for those losses of course 
because their hard work is where the bucks originate but the 
federal savings amp loan insurance corporation is hardly the only 
governmentbacked program in trouble 
the federal deposit insurance corp and the federal housing 
administration lost money in 1988 and 1989 and seem destined to 
lose again this year about half of farm loans by the farmers home 
administration are in default 
theres a lot more federally backed debt than that as you might 
surmise but much of it will never appear in the official budget 
deficit figures because the government simply shoved them away 
they are off budget 
pastdue real estate loans at banks climbed 32 billion in the 
apriljune period corporate junkbond defaults so far this year 
total nearly 10 billion or already about 1 billion more than all 
of last year 
those junkbond defaults dont give a full picture of the 
tenuous financial substructure of american industry a further 
examination which wright investors service undertook suggests the 
direction of corporate financing 
nonfinancial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross 
national product rose to 67 percent last year from 47 percent 20 
years earlier and 39 percent 30 years ago 
in the 20 years through 1989 the ratio of interest expense to 
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent 
in the late 1980s half of all funds raised by nonfinancial 
corporations came from debt as recently as the 1960s and 1970s 
the average was only 24 percent debt 
all this debt much of it from abroad must be dealt with in the 
1990s and probably will be because it cannot continue without 
economic performance becoming ragged and eventually collapsing 
under the burden of interest rates 
but americans should not believe the correction will occur 
automatically or without pain as to some extent the buildup did 
simply stated it will be repaid by such means as taxes and 
inflation and relatively high interest costs perhaps accompanied 
by lessened wage increases and smaller productivity gains 
it will be repaid by individuals not by businesses or 
governments for the latter are just collections of individuals 
running the machinery that processes the bills

soaring oil prices are pushing ailing airlines 
toward their biggest losses ever and they might become a catalyst 
for a severe shakeup of the troubled industry analysts say 
coupled with the sluggish economy the fallout from the persian 
gulf crisis will hurt all airlines but it might eventually end up 
helping the stronger carriers get bigger at the expense of their 
struggling competitors 
itll make the financially weaker guys get weaker faster 
said kevin murphy an analyst with morgan stanley the strong 
airlines would then grow by default 
under such a scenario analysts say the winners who stand to 
gain market share could be american delta and united losers will 
likely include eastern continental midway pan am and trans 
world the analysts say 
unless something puts the brakes on oil prices and the domestic 
economy finds a quick fix analysts anticipate that the airline 
industry will lose 1 billion to 2 billion for 1990 that would 
surpass 1982s record operating loss of 700 million 
it will be decidedly ugly said samuel buttrick an analyst 
with kidder peabody amp co 
the fundamental problem that the industry faces is excess 
domestic capacity too many seats chasing too few people 
buttrick said he sees the failure of some carriers and the 
removal of their assets from the market as the best way to restore 
equilibrium to the glutted market 
the gloomy business climate might push one or two over the 
brink said analyst raymond e neidl of dillon read amp co inc 
eastern is probably the most endangered airline pan am is facing 
problems 
murphy and buttrick predict eastern will die with murphy 
putting the carriers doomsday at around the end of the year and at 
the latest in about 200 days 
i figure theyve got 300 million and theyre losing money at 
the rate of a million and a half a day despite efforts to 
reorganize in us bankruptcy court he said 
others say eastern might live longer than the doubters are 
predicting 
one has to remember that people have been spelling the death 
knell for pan am and eastern for a decade or more and theyre 
still here said george james president of airline economics 
inc a washington consulting firm it takes a long time for the 
assets of a big carrier to be used up 
the immediate troubles of the industry were underscored last 
week when pan am announced it would cut 2500 jobs by mid october 
and reduce its capacity by 75 percent during 1991 
the moves come after the troubled carrier has sold assets and 
found no immediate success in finding a merger partner 
neidl said the cutbacks intended to save tens of millions of 
dollars will probably buy time for pan am but there is no 
guarantee the plan will work 
it may get them through another slow winter period neidl 
said that would get them into the high summer season it would 
get them more time to look for an outside source for that capital 
infusion they need 
shortly after pan am announced plans to shrink to what it hopes 
will be a profitable size an aide to debtplagued developer donald 
j trump said trump had missed a payment of 11 million on the 
trump shuttle trump is asking bankers to let him delay future 
payments and saying that the high cost of jet fuel is causing his 
problems 
analysts agree that the rising fuel costs are the biggest threat 
to airlines these days since iraq invaded kuwait in august jet 
fuel has gone up about 50 percent 
if oil prices dont fall airlines could end up paying up to 6 
billion a year in extra fuel costs according to industry 
statisticians 
airlines responded to the inflated costs with two rounds of fare 
hikes that come to about 10 percent on domestic flights not nearly 
enough to offset the higher fuel tab but it took them about two 
months after the invasion to set the higher fares into effect 
because no airline wants to go out on a limb with higher prices 
in the meantime airlines lost money as travelers flew for the 
old rate on planes that were using the expensive fuel

as the traditional peak season of the year for 
consumer spending approaches wall street is decidedly unbullish 
on retailing 
the stocks of most of the nations major store operators have 
fallen sharply since midsummer posting losses as big as or bigger 
than the decline in the market as a whole 
even as the early floodtide of christmas catalogs has reached 
the nations mailboxes the retailing business is confronted with 
recession fears soaring oil prices and surveys showing little 
enthusiasm among the nations shoppers 
falling consumer confidence presents a troubling outlook for 
fourthquarter consumer spending said anthony vignola at the 
investment firm of kidder peabody amp co 
this trend could be particularly damaging to the important 
christmas selling season and the demand by retailers for seasonal 
supplies 
the primary catalyst for the selloff in retailing stocks of 
course was iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait and the upsurge in oil 
prices that followed 
analysts saw the increase in energy costs as the functional 
equivalent of a tax increase crimping consumers disposable 
income regular surveys by economists designed to measure consumer 
confidence seem to bear out that view 
some observers point out that the outlook for retailers was 
already worsening appreciably before the crisis in the persian 
gulf 
the latest numbers simply extend the downward trend in 
yearoveryear sales gains that has been under way since early in 
1989 said david resler chief economist at nomura securities 
international in new york 
aggregate demand appeared to be on a progressively slowing 
path even before the mideast crisis now heightened consumer 
anxiety reflected in polls showing a majority of respondents 
expects recession threatens to become a selffulfilling 
prophecy 
all this helps explain why the stock of sears roebuck a 
prominent general merchandise retailer traded last week around 
27 down from 48 in 1989 
the limited a widely followed specialty retailer slipped below 
15 against 2562 just a few months earlier adjusted for splits 
even walmart stores revered on wall street as one of the 
nations great growth companies has traded of late at around 
2650 down more than 25 percent from its recent record high of 
3675 again adjusted for splits 
at these discount prices some bargainminded investors are 
naturally scrutinizing retail stocks but many analysts still take 
a wary view of the group 
we dont believe the retail environment will improve until the 
second half of 1991 wrote barry bryant who follows the industry 
for prudentialbache securities 
we believe a mild recession will begin in the fourth quarter 
of 1990 and continue into the second quarter of 1991 we expect 
retail sales to grow only 4 percent to 5 percent and to be flat 
when adjusted for inflation 
the slower growth is expected to occur during a period when 
retailers will be facing their most difficult sales and earnings 
comparisons 
at the value line investment survey analysts also are 
recommending a goslow approach to retailing issues 
the firm acknowledges that bigname stocks in the industry like 
sears k mart and jc penney have lately been sporting dividend 
yields in the neighborhood of 6 percent 
even though the dividend offers some downside protection for 
those equities were not recommending purchase just yet said 
value lines bart schneider in the firms latest quarterly report 
on the group 
nearterm prospects for the retail industry are unsettled and 
it appears that conditions will probably get worse before they get 
better

when gerber products co executive al 
bolles tasted the bitter adultoriented fruit drink offered at a 
trade show he was sure his company could do it better 
bolles director of product development for the babyfood 
company picked up samples of the drink fibemini at a trade show 
in japan the fibercontaining drink was destined for the palates 
of adult asians 
nobody liked it bolles said of the tastes of fibemini he 
gave to other gerber executives i said we can make something 
better than this 
the result two years later was juice amp more the first adult 
product put out by the baby facetrademarked company the target 
market for fiberenriched juice amp more will be people concerned 
about cholesterol and heart disease 
it will be the beachhead of our marketing efforts to older 
individuals gerber chairman al piergallini said this is all 
new territory for us 
juice amp more is to hit the shelves this week in 7200 stores in 
florida alabama georgia south carolina north carolina 
virginia kentucky west virginia tennessee pennsylvania new 
york city and washington dc gerber hopes to bring the product to 
the rest of the country by spring 
gerber has looked into adult foods before frozen dinners for 
singles ketchup peanut butter and other products but no project 
has made it this far 
laboratory researchers concocted 200 products over about four 
months combining juice with various kinds of fiber before they hit 
on a formula they thought was a winner juice amp more uses apple 
pectin and acadia plants as the sources for its fiber the formula 
would give a person as much fiber as two bowls of oatmeal in an 
8ounce glass 
but taste was the key gerber director of nutrition dick 
cotter said this had it 
the next test comes at the checkout counter where gerber 
officials said they hope the juice will bring in 25 million in the 
next two years 
analysts arent sure 
im optimistic about gerber but im skeptical about this 
particular product said john mcmillin who follows the food 
industry to prudentialbache securities in new york 
martin friedman editor of gormans new product news said less 
than 1 percent of new products put on the consumer market will 
survive 
but theres a tremendous pot of gold at the end of the rainbow 
if they come out with the right item he said 
gerber posted a record 941 million in profits in the fiscal 
year ended march 31 it had revenues of 11 billion and wants to 
keep pushing those figures up 
introducing a fiberenriched juice let alone one for adults in 
a company whose whole existence has been based on babies is a 
chance 
if youre going to grow you innovate piergallini said 
when you innovate theres risk

canadian auto workers union members 
overwhelmingly approved a new contract with ford motor cos canada 
subsidiary ending a nineday strike that officials said threatened 
production at us plants 
about 91 percent of the 12800 members voting cast ballots in 
favor of the new threeyear pact union officials said sunday 
the strike which started sept 15 idled fords nine canadian 
plants all in ontario production at fords us plants some of 
which rely on canadian components had been threatened by the 
strike company officials said 
assembly line workers were expected to return to work today 
some workers were expected back on the job sunday night to set up 
equipment for production said caw president robert white 
the contract provides for a 75 percent increase in wages in the 
first year 67 percent in the second and 48 percent in the third 
that means workers now earning the base rate of 1783 an hour 
will get 2141 by the end of the contract 
workers also will get three extra days off a year which will be 
scheduled to give them fourday weekends that will give ford 
workers nine fourday work weeks a year once statutory holidays 
are taken into account 
among other benefits one years notice of any workplace 
closing six months notice of any job loss as a result of 
technological change special programs to pay workers who take 
early retirement and income supplements of up to three years for 
workers who lose their jobs 
the deal with ford clears the way for the union to negotiate 
contracts with general motors corp and chrysler corp 
the union picked ford as its strike target following separate 
preliminary talks with gm and chrysler 
as in the past the contract is expected to form the basis for 
agreements with the other two companies 
gm and the united auto workers averted a strike and reached a 
tentative agreement last week on a threeyear contract covering 
300000 workers in 29 states 
that agreement which is likely to be ratified was reported to 
include a 3 percent raise the first year 3 percent lumpsum 
payments the next two and retention of a requirement that gm hire 
one worker for every two who quit retire or die before retirement 
once the gm contract is ratified the uaw will seek to negotiate 
similar contracts with ford and chrysler in the united states

the bush administration stepping up efforts 
to gather support in the campaign against iraqi president saddam 
hussein is getting encouragement from the two largest 
international lending agencies 
top finance ministers participating in a series of weekend 
meetings expressed their general support for a usled initiative 
to get the international monetary fund and the world bank to devote 
significant resources to cushioning the economic shock from the 
persian gulf crisis 
a formal endorsement of the aid effort was expected to come 
today following the conclusion of closeddoor meetings of the imfs 
policysetting interim committee 
british chancellor of the exchequer john major told reporters 
sunday that the question of whether to provide aid was not at 
issue but he said details of the exact amount and which countries 
to help remained to be worked out 
the united states concerned that the economic embargo against 
iraq could crumble without assistance to countries hurt by the 
trade ban has been pushing for more than 10 billion in aid to the 
socalled front line states of egypt turkey and jordan 
it also is seeking billions of dollars in additional 
contributions to a host of countries ranging from emerging 
democracies in eastern europe to such third world nations as the 
philippines india and brazil to offset the adverse effects on 
their economies from higher oil prices 
the worlds seven richest industrial countries the united 
states japan west germany britain france italy and canada 
provided an initial endorsement for persian gulf assistance 
following a daylong meeting saturday the rich countries took note 
of the double risks of inflation and recession imposed by the 
doubling of world oil prices since iraqs aug 2 invasion of 
kuwait 
all of the discussions were being held as part of the annual 
meetings of the 152nation imf and its sister organization the 
world bank 
those sessions have gained new urgency as finance officials 
struggle to come up with strategies to keep the global economy from 
tumbling into a recession as a result of the persian gulf turmoil 
president bush was to address the delegates on tuesday 
representatives for india and brazil made special appeals for 
assistance during sundays closeddoor meetings according to 
participants in the sessions 
brazilian finance minister zelia maria cardoso de mello said 
that even before iraqs invasion of kuwait sent oil prices 
skyrocketing global growth had weakened considerably 
the gulf crisis changed this already bleak picture 
dramatically for the worse she said in a statement released to 
reporters the moment calls for unprecedented efforts at 
cooperation and strong support from the multilateral financial 
institutions 
japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said he believed the 
imf and the world bank had an extremely critical role to play 
in coordinating the assistance efforts being mounted to respond to 
the mideast crisis 
after some initial criticism japan has come up with offers of 
4 billion in aid with half that amount earmarked for support of 
the military effort and the other half going to provide economic 
assistance to the front line states

the governing labor party on monday 
approved sweeping policy changes that pave the way for competition 
in telecommunications and the sale of the two state airlines 
the issue of privatization had threatened to split the party 
which officially had opposed any efforts to sell off 
governmentowned enterprises 
the most divisive issue particularly among unions has been 
telecommunications a number of foreign companies have expressed 
interest in entering the australian communications market 
delegates at a special party conference voted 5843 on monday to 
reject an amendment that would have prevented a private competitor 
being established in full network competition to a merger of 
domestic carrier telecom and overseas carrier otc 
the conference then passed on voice vote a resolution allowing 
the merger of telecom and otc the sale of the governments 
financially troubled satellite company aussat and full private 
competition 
later in the day the conference endorsed the governments plan 
to sell up to 49 percent of qantas and all of australian airlines 
the conference rejected a proposed amendment which would have 
merged the airlines and kept them under full government control 
treasurer paul keating labeled the amendment as horrible and 
rejected claims that the government deliberately starved the 
airlines of funding so it could argue for their sale 
transport and communications minister kim beazley accepted an 
amendment that limits to 35 percent the amount of qantas which 
could be sold to foreign interests

the us government has underwritten war risk 
insurance on a commercial ship engaged in normal commercial trade 
for the first time since the korean war in the early 1950s the 
shipping daily lloyds list reported monday 
in a frontpage story lloyds said the 40921ton stonewall 
jackson owned by waterman steamship is the first vessel operating 
commercially to take advantage of the us governments standby war 
risk insurance program since it became effective aug 29 
the lash barge carrier which is about to make a call at the 
jordanian port of aqaba received war risk insurance from the us 
maritime administration on the hull and the 89 barges she carries 
the paper said 
under the program any foreign or us ship may apply to the 
maritime administration for war risk coverage provided the vessel 
is engaged in us trade the maritime agency is permitted to quote 
rates when the rates and conditions being offered in the commercial 
insurance market are considered unfair and unreasonable the paper 
said 
the maritime administration has already issued war risk policies 
for 30 of the merchant vessels taken by the us military sealift 
command for operation desert shield in the gulf lloyds list said 
it has issued its own policies and any claims will be paid by the 
us department of defense 
but the stonewall jackson was the first merchant ship operating 
commercially to take advantage of the program the paper said 
the stonewall jackson was on a voyage from the united states to 
the far east via the suez canal when part of her cargo consigned to 
catholic relief services in india was diverted for the 
international relief effort in jordan it said 
waterman steamship approached the maritime administration for a 
war risks quote for stopping at aqaba which is in a rated war 
risks area it said 
market rates for hull risks to aqaba are currently around 025 
percent lloyds list said 
a us government source quoted by the paper said the maritime 
administration has to quote lower rates for the program to work and 
the commercial insurance market is not very happy with us 
because they see the administration as a potential competitor

soviet lawmakers voted overwhelmingly today to 
forsake seven decades of communist economics endorsing a rescue 
plan to create a free market system from the failed machinery of 
centralized planning 
the supreme soviet also gave president mikhail s gorbachev 
sweeping new powers to implement the reforms unilaterally 
but the lawmakers continued to disagree on which of several 
competing economic blueprints for accomplishing the switch should 
be followed 
after a confusing and tumultuous debate the supreme soviet 
settled on a resolution calling for a committee of legislators and 
economists appointed by gorbachev to merge the various recipes into 
a unified plan by oct 15 the vote was 32311 with 56 
abstentions 
although differences remained it was the first time the supreme 
soviet had committed the country to switching to a market economy 
in hopes of ending chronic shortages of everything from housing to 
bread and arresting inflation and a soaring budget deficit 
when the resolution was approved there was no applause or other 
display of emotion not even by gorbachev sitting alone on a 
raised stage in a marble kremlin meeting hall 
hours later the parliament approved 30546 with 41 abstentions 
gorbachevs request for broad emergency poers to carry out 
reforms it gave him the authority until march 1992 to bypass 
stepbystep legislative scrutiny and issue decrees on property 
management of the economy the budget and law and order 
the legislature would have the power to recommend gorbachev 
cancel or modify the decrees which the president said he would 
begin issuing soon 
several lawmakers feared they were giving gorbachev too much 
power and one said it would make him a monarch 
but in an animated 15minute speech gorbachev vowed to exercise 
his new powers with full responsibility 
its a responsibility its not a tea party he said 
the adopted resolution endorses a compromise program backed by 
gorbachev but calls for incorporating a more conservative recipe 
of prime minister nikolai ryzhkov 
lawmakers later agreed they should also try to include parts of 
a more radical plan approved by the russian federation the largest 
of the 15 soviet republics led by russian president boris n 
yeltsin 
yeltsin is gorbachevs chief political rival and his parliament 
has set the pace on reforming an economy so inefficient that crops 
spoil on their way to market and plants stand idle for lack of 
spare parts 
we can and must come out with a single program for switching 
to a market economy gorbachev said he said the goal is 
maximum accord in society and not confrontation 
ryzhkov facing mounting calls for his resignation said the 
vote left no victors and no defeated 
this is a compromise he said in an interview 
sergei stankevich moscows deputy mayor and a national 
legislator said gorbachevs insistence on unifying the competing 
programs would lead not to consolidation but to collapse 
consumer shortages are widespread and worsening most recently 
including bread and there is fear of economic collapse 
gorbachevs program would reverse the direction that the soviet 
union has taken since the bolshevik revolution especially stalins 
forced collectivization which claimed the lives of some 7 million 
people 
it would create a federation of republics with economies built 
on private businesses individually owned farms and stock markets 
trading shares in competitive companies 
the program marks a significant change in gorbachevs tactics 
his perestroika program had been aimed at restructuring 
centralized socialism but now is apparently moving toward 
destroying it 
lawmakers had been scheduled to vote on friday but failed to 
muster a quorum and had to adjourn until today gorbachev expressed 
frustration at the time saying there was no more time to talk 
think try and experiment 
several participants in todays debate proposed that the 
national legislature shun the attempt at a compromise and endorse 
instead the most radical reform plan under consideration that of 
economist stanislav shatalin 
there can be no compromise between the programs of the 
government the president and the shatalin group the 56yearold 
shatalin told the legislature 
outside the kremlin protesters gathered to express 
disappointment in gorbachevs handling of the economic crisis 
dozens of signcarrying protesters chanted slogans at legislators 
as they arrived for the morning debate 
the people dont trust gorbachev about a dozen 
demonstrators shouted outside the kremlins spassky gate 
they held signs that read a president not an emperor and 
all decrees of the president are battles against democracy 
ryzhkov who has become a lightning rod for the growing public 
unrest predicted on soviet television sunday night that the move 
to a market economy will take years not 500 days 
he confirmed very serious problems in bringing this years 
bumper harvest to market he said at most only onethird of crops 
have so far been harvested

corn and soybean futures prices opened slightly 
lower this morning on the chicago board of trade reflecting a lack 
of significant frost damage to those crops over the weekend wheat 
futures were narrowly mixed 
freezing temperatures were concentrated in the northwest corner 
of the corn belt but there was little damage to the crops 
forecasts call for a warming trend and scant rain in the corn 
belt this week which should push lateplanted crops toward 
maturity and allow harvesting to progress 
analysts said the early losses were limited by buying linked to 
strength in the energy and precious metals markets and weakness in 
the stock market in reaction to warlike rhetoric from iraqs saddam

the white house today warned congress that 
efforts to put off next mondays deadline for 100 billion in 
automatic spending cuts likely will be met with a presidential 
veto 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the grammrudman 
law targets which require the automatic cuts in the absence of 
congressional agreement on deficitreduction are an important 
discipline 
they were put there by congress to enforce decisionmaking and 
we dont agree they should be extended he said 
asked if that was a clear veto threat for efforts to delay the 
spending cuts to give budget negotiators some additional breathing 
room fitzwater said a veto threat is a veto threat i conclude 
its a veto threat 
fitzwater noted that the administration in the past has 
suggested that president bush was likely to veto stopgap funding 
legislation that would delay or reduce the deficit targets 
however todays strong renewal of the threat coming just 
seven days before the deadline and as budget talks remained 
deadlocked appeared calculated to increase pressure on the 
bargaining process 
there are a number of things that still divide us were still 
hopeful we can get agreement weve got seven days to go were 
tminus seven were sticking with it and still talking he 
said 
fitzwater also was critical of what he called efforts by 
democrats to suggest that the major stumbling block was 
administration insistence on a cut in the capital gains tax 
the democrats have been able to focus attention on the capital 
gains provision to the overall detriment of the progress of the 
negotiations fitzwater said 
he said there were other important areas of disagreement 
were not even close on the spending cut side fitzwater said 
support in congress has grown as next mondays deadline 
approaches for a temporary measure to delay the targets until 
later in october but fitzwater made it clear the administration 
wasnt interested in such a postponement at this time 
the spokesman said that bush would join the budget negotiations 
but probably not until pretty close to the end when its 
necessary well be there 
as to a new proposal by senate minority leader bob dole rkan 
for a package that would offset a cut in capital gains taxes with 
higher taxes on the wealthy fitzwater said 
we certainly share his frustration that everybody needs to get 
off the dime and get an agreement here 
however fitzwater would not comment on the specific proposal 
the kansas republican said gop negotiators at the 4monthold 
budget talks were resisting democratic efforts to raise the income 
tax rate for the wealthiest americans from 28 percent to 33 
percent 
doles remarks made it clear that republicans are searching for 
ways to keep the capital gains tax reduction a favorite proposal 
of president bush alive at the budget talks bargainers have said 
contention over capital gains is the major obstruction to a final 
budget deal 
democrats have said republicans must either abandon the proposal 
or be prepared to also accept higher levies on the wealthy who 
democrats say would gain the most from a lowered capital gains tax 
the levy is imposed on sales of property 
were looking at ways to increase taxes on upper income in 
a way that will in effect maybe pierce this socalled bubble but 
maybe not go clear to 33 percent dole said sunday on cbs tvs 
face the nation program 
the bubble is used to describe the portion of the income tax 
structure that imposes a 28 percent rate on the wealthiest 
americans but a 33 percent rate on those with slightly less income 
it was unclear whether dole was referring to actually increasing 
the rates for the richest taxpayers during the budget 
negotiations republicans have offered to eliminate certain 
deductions for topbracket taxpayers which they have argued would 
in effect raise those rates without actually doing so 
doles comments came before bush administration officials and 
congressional leaders met for four hours in a private room at the 
capitol in an effort to work out a budget deal 
they talked about everything said an official who asked to 
not be identified 
the bargainers planned to meet again today and resume their 
effort to work out a fiveyear 500 billion package of spending 
cuts and tax increases 
on the same television program senate majority leader george j 
mitchell blamed the bush administration for the glacial pace at 
which the talks have so far progressed 
if this were a negotiation just among the congressional 
leadership we would have had an agreement a couple of weeks ago 
said the maine democrat the problem is the administrations 
position and its dominant role in the discussions and its 
insistence upon its way 
dole also seemed vexed by the administrations pace during the 
talks 
we shouldnt be in too much of a rush dole said 
administration officials have told him well i dont know what 
else theyve got to do this year but ive got a lot of things id 
like to do 
the negotiators expect a pressurefilled week 
the new fiscal year begins a week from today the grammrudman 
law will automatically cut federal spending by 85 billion on oct 
1 unless a deal is reached or lawmakers decide to postpone the 
slashes

the senate took up legislation today aimed at 
driving gas guzzlers off the road with sponsors of a tougher fuel 
economy bill rejecting industry claims that the measure would make 
them produce only small cars 
we can reach the goals without downsizing cars declared 
sen slade gordon rwash one of the bills sponsors 
sen richard bryan dnev another sponsor read statements by 
auto industry executives in the early 1970s predicting the demise 
of the family sedan as a result of fuel efficiency requirements 
then under consideration 
that just didnt happen the sixpassenger vehicle is here 
just as it was before said bryan the fuel economy measures were 
put into effect and average mileage for cars increased from 14 mpg 
to about 28 mpg over the last 15 years 
the bill before the senate would require the average fuel 
economy of cars to go to about 35 mpg over the next five years and 
to 40 mpg by the year 2001 saving millions of barrels of oil a 
year 
the senate debate comes at automakers prepare to roll out their 
1991 cars including many models that emphasize comfort and 
performance instead of fuel economy industry lobbyists contend 
the only way to achieve the fuel economy goals of the senate bill 
would be to dramatically reduce the size and weight of cars 
sendonald riegle dmich hoped to head off a vote later in 
the week on the legislation either by saddling it with amendments 
or garnering enough opposition so supporters cannot get the 
required 60 votes to end debate 
a vote to cut off debate and bring the matter to a vote could 
come as early as tuesday 
the mideast crisis that caused soaring oil prices and the threat 
of future gasoline lines has given the legislation new momentum 
supporters claim the more fuel efficient cars eventually could save 
the country 28 million barrels of oil a day 
but auto industry lobbyists contend the kinds of fuel efficiency 
increases being talked about on capitol hill are not economically 
feasible 
and in recent weeks the automakers have stepped up their 
campaign against fuel economy bills in both the house and senate 
if the bill were enacted into law we would have economic 
disaster on our hands almost everything that is being built now 
would be obsolete by the year 2001 maintains thomas hanna 
president of the motor vehicle manufacturers association 
the senate voted 6828 last week to rebuff efforts by riegle 
whose state is home to most of the us auto industry to keep the 
auto fuel economy bill from getting to the senate floor 
the american people understand better now than they did 
before the iraqi invasion that were very vulnerable in terms of 
oil imports bryan said in a recent interview there is a 
recognition that we need to do something 
the automakers cause gained a boost last week when the bush 
administration weighed in heavily against the bryan bill 
transportation secretary samuel skinner called it unrealistic 
irresponsible and unattainable 
he said he was convinced it would prompt manufacturers to 
dramatically reduce the size and weight of their cars thereby 
resulting in between 600 and 1100 additional automobile fatalities 
a year he and energy secretary james watkins have said they would 
urge president bush to veto the measure if it clears congress 
the legislations supporters also have a sizeable hurdle to 
overcome in the house where any auto fuel economy bill normally 
would have to go through the energy and commerce committee whose 
chairman rep john dingell dmich has made no secret of his 
distaste for the proposal

csx transportation inc won a temporary 
injunction monday to end a railroad workers strike that stopped or 
delayed as many as 400 trains in at least 10 states a company 
spokesman said 
a temporary restraining order of 10 days duration has been 
issued and the judge has instructed the pickets to come down 
immediately spokesman lindsay leckie said from the companys 
jacksonville fla headquarters 
the injunction was issued monday morning by us district judge 
karl forester in lexington a preliminary hearing was set for 
friday 
the strike by the brotherhood of maintenance of way began early 
monday at more than two dozen locations on the old louisville amp 
nashville line between chicago new orleans and pensacola fla 
leckie said the workers protested the companys refusal to 
transport them away from their work sites for lunch 
the picket lines were honored by hundreds of workers in other 
craft unions he said 
as many as 400 of csxs 1300 trains either were stopped by the 
strike or had to be operated by supervisory personnel he said 
leckie said he did not know how many trains were stopped 
the brotherhood of maintenance of way represents workers who 
maintain the railroads tracks bridges and signs 
the union complaint was registered in eastern kentucky he said 
other states involved included indiana illinois tennessee 
ohio alabama louisiana mississippi georgia and florida leckie 
said 
the issue is that the labor organization is insisting that 
employees be transported from the work site back to their lodging 
facilities either railroad camp cars or their hotels leckie 
said our contention is meals can and should be provided at the 
work site itself 
workers get from 30 minutes to an hour for lunch but that could 
stretch to three hours in some cases if transportation time was 
added he said the issue has been settled in the companys favor 
during arbitration in the past leckie said

total daily production of crude oil by opec members 
has risen from 197 million barrels in august to 22 million barrels 
now an international energy agency official said 
the watchdog agency which represents 21 industrialized western 
countries is scheduled to meet in paris on friday to assess the 
impact of the gulf confrontation on world oil supplies 
the agency official who spoke on condition that his name not be 
used said monday the crude oil supply situation hasnt changed 
significantly since mid august 
given the estimated rise in opec output the official said the 
situation in world oil markets was manageable though not 
comfortable oil companies have had to draw on stocks during a 
period normally reserved for building up reserves ahead of the 
highdemand winter season he said 
demand among the members of the organization for economic 
cooperation and development which includes all iea members plus 
france finland and iceland is estimated at 389 million barrels 
per day in the fourth quarter up from the previously reported 
estimate of 378 million for the third quarter the official said 
before iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 opec was cutting 
back to reach a quota target of 225 million barrels per day the 
official said 
following the subsequent boycott of iraqi and kuwaiti crude 
which took an estimated 4 million barrels of oil out of the market 
each day opec oil ministers agreed to temporarily suspend the 
cartels production quotas to allow its members to make up for the 
shortfall 
now the cartel appears well on its way to boosting production 
saudi arabia with the largest available amount of surplus 
capacity has produced an average 73 million barrels a day in 
september up from a revised 56 million the month before

brazil is not ready to enter negotiations on new 
international measures to regulate the world coffee market 
brazilian officials said monday 
it is not the appropriate moment to start negotiations but we 
do not want to close the door on negotiations said celso amorim 
a senior brazilian foreign ministry official attending 
ifee organization talks 
amorim and joao cunha of the brazilian economics ministry are 
heading their countrys delegation to the talks here among the 
coffee organizations 73 consumer and producer member countries 
brazil said more time was neednternational cofed before a decision 
was made on 
negotiations for a new international coffee agreement with the 
powers to regulate supplies and prices amorim said 
the present pacts powers to do this exercised through a 
system of export quotas were suspended in july 1989 following a 
dispute among producers over export market share the suspension 
triggered a massive fall in world prices which hit a 14year low 
late last year and have recovered only slightly since 
the present coffee agreement expires on sept 30 1991 
colombia the worlds second biggest producer has called on the 
coffee organization to decide this week what should happen then 
the options are to extend the present administrative agreementt the 
voice to that spot as if the 
music were a character released into space 
touch with your sound your wordlet it get away from you 
see it its a vision 
curtin says her daughter claudia whos in her 20s told her 
she had used that idea to guide her horse over obstructions by 
throwing a precise mental image of the movement in front of her and 
following it 
to project the voice the chest must be released out and up 
the posture of anyone who has been successful curtin says 
teaching that to students in the 1970s as a professor at yale 
university was nearly impossible she says 
to stand up straight meant that you were with all the 
conservatives and the warmongers you were for big money she 
says so everyone slunk down the posture was really casual 
curtin started teaching at tanglewood 26 years ago at the peak 
of a performing career that took her to the worlds leading stages 
new yorks metropolitan milans la scala and the vienna 
staatsoper 
on teaching singers fiendishly difficult 20th century music 
curtin quotes olga averino the russianborn soprano who was her 
teacher 
darling so simple says the west virginia native speaking 
with a heavy slavic accent its just like teaching a rabbit how 
to play a drum you just do it over and over and over 
curtin stopped performing at the age of 61 about a decade later 
than most sopranos by that time she had been appointed dean of 
the boston university school for the arts 
the major problem with young singers today she says is that 
theyre often welltrained poodles a homogenized product 
of coaches who tell them by rote what to do 
meanwhile she tells her students i want you to be smart i 
want you to be your own artist i dont want you to be a dumb 
musician 
the main quality of teaching is sharing she says quoting 
thornton wilders novel the ides of march in which caesar 
tells cleopatra that theres nothing so exhilarating as teaching 
to a young and eager mind what its taken you 20 years of drudgery 
to discover 
when shes teaching she says the minute the music turns on 
somehow my channels are open the thing that is emotion that is 
music is running through the center of my body and out out out 
a masterful teacher turns out people who do it better than he 
does and i would like to be that 
she started practicing to be that at age 9 in west virginia 
i took dancing lessons and my very dearest friend did not 
she says so i would come home from my lesson and teach it all 
to her and that was so much fun 
almost six decades after that first attempt at teaching her 
former student baritone sanford sylvan says curtin is his 
artistic motherthe wind beneath my wings

the number of working oil and natural gas rigs in 
the united states dropped this week by five to 1055 the oil 
toolmaker baker hughes inc reported monday 
a week ago the widely watched index of drilling activity had 
increased by 21 to total 1060 the count a year ago was 967 baker 
hughes said 
the houstonbased company has kept track of the rig count since 
1940 the count represents the number of rigs actively exploring 
for oil not those producing oil 
at the height of the oil boom in december 1981 the rig count 
reached a peak of 4500 but the rig count plunged to a low of 663 
after oil prices collapsed in the summer of 1986 
texas added five rigs in the latest count while ohios count 
rose three louisianas count was down five and wyoming was down 
three

australian gold mining giants bhp gold mines 
ltd and newmont australia ltd said monday they plan to merge 
the surprise proposal which could thwart poseidon gold ltds 
hostile takeover for newmont values the threeyear old bhp gold at 
4753 million australian dollars or about 3964 million 
the merged company would take complete control of the telfer 
gold mine in western australias pilbara region 
newmont is offering one ordinary share for every two bhp gold 
shares the offer is contingent upon 51 per cent acceptance and 
newmont shareholders approving an increase in authorized capital 
the bhp co ltd currently holds 56 percent of bhp gold but its 
effective stake in the merged entity would total 23 percent 
while bhp is yet to announce its intentions under the merger 
proposal directors are expected to agree to the gold division 
being subsumed just three years after its listing 
bhp gold chairman john gough agreed that although bhp gold would 
hold four of the nine board seats the managerial influence and 
culture would stem from newmont 
two major stumbling blocks remain with newmonts largest 
shareholders the usbased newmont mining corp and robert de 
crespignys poseidon gold ltd with a rival bid on the table yet 
to announce their intentions 
newmont mining which once held more than 70 per cent of newmont 
and has been anxious to sell its remaining 25 per cent has 
consented to the increased capital base but firmly repeated its 
intention not to give anyone control of more than 20 percent of its 
local unit 
in a brief statement newmont mining directors said the company 
would eventually sell its diluted 14 per cent stake in a manner 
which would be the least disruptive to the market 
poseidon gold said its twoforone share offer which has been 
stymied by legal action initiated by newmont was still open 
in a joint statement newmont chairman sir brian inglis and bp 
golds gough said the merger would result in a financially strong 
gold mining house with enormous exploration potential and 
forecast 199091 production of 750000 ounces of gold 
gough said the merger had been under consideration at bhp gold 
since late last year when newmont directors approached bhp gold 
with a tentative merger proposal after newmont mining indicated its 
intention to sell 
the proposal is subject to approval under the foreign 
acquisitions and takeovers act and requires approvals from newmont 
shareholders the boards of bhp gold and bhp co ltd

the persian gulf crisis has given 
new life to brazils program to run its vehicles on pure sugarcane 
alcohol instead of gasoline 
shortages of the sugarcane fuel which has high production 
costs and an abundance of inexpensive foreign oil had turned 
brazilians off to alcohol 
but as oil prices have risen beyond 34 a barrel as a result of 
iraqs takeover of kuwait critics are taking another look one of 
the worlds leading alternative fuel programs called proalcohol 
here 
the program is not finished president fernando collor de 
mello told delegates attending a sugarcane energy meeting shortly 
after iraqs aug 2 invasion with the crisis in the gulf the 
strategic importance of proalcohol also increases 
general motors and autolatina a production consortium that 
includes ford and volkswagen announced an immediate 11 percent 
increase in production of cars able to run on alcohol fuel to meet 
a rise in demand 
the country was the victim of an optical illusion that oil 
would be eternally cheap and plentiful julio maria borges 
production director of copersucar brazils largest alcohol 
cooperative said in an interview 
the resurrection of proalcohol is good news for owners of 
brazils 45 million alcohol cars onethird of the nations 
vehicles who believed the clean weetsmelling fuel was the 
energy of the future 
the program began in response to the opec oil shock of 1973 
brazil which imported 80 percent of its petroleum saw its oil 
bill soar from 600 million to 2 billion in 1974 or onefourth of 
total imports 
alcohol seemed like the solution to dependency on foreign oil 
its made from sugar cane a renewable source that grows abundantly 
here and it fit in well with the national security concerns of 
the military governments that ran brazil from 196485 
few mentioned the risks alcohol was untested on a wide scale 
anywhere in the world it gave poor mileage and cost more than 40 
a barrel to make 
but brazil riding the euphoria of its fuel idea was undaunted 
at sinking billions of dollars in a longterm project 
in 1975 its first year proalcohol produced alcohol that mixed 
with gasoline to make gasohol 
in 1979 2271 cars were built and sold that ran solely on pure 
alcohol 
but there were bugs in the early models they wouldnt start on 
cold mornings few in this mostly tropical country but not unknown 
in the southeast and the alcohol corroded metal carburators and 
fuel tanks automakers eventually devised minigas tanks for cold 
starts and anticorrosion coatings 
to compensate for poor mileage the government made alcohol 35 
percent cheaper than gasoline and offered tax breaks on alcohol 
cars it promoted the program with the slogan alcohol cars 
someday youll own one 
the response was overwhelming sales of the new cars rose to 38 
percent of the market in 1982 and 88 percent the next year 
in 1985 the peak for alcohol cars 96 of every 100 cars sold 
were alcoholpowered pumps bearing the green a for alcohol 
sprouted in service stations across this country of 150 million 
residents 
but things began to go wrong for proalcohol 
oil prices leveled off then fell alcohol still 40 a barrel 
began to be too expensive 
worse the government couldnt raise the pump price of alcohol 
without also raising gasoline the spiral of fuel prices helped 
pushed annual inflation up to three digits then four 
farmers encouraged by subsidies replaced food crops with sugar 
cane the government had to import food adding to its 117 billion 
foreign debt highest in the developing world 
in a final irony brazil discovered major offshore oil reserves 
of its own the countrys foreign oil dependency fell under 50 
percent 
critics claimed brazils net energy gain with alcohol was 
negligible because trucks tractors and harvesters on cane 
plantations ran on cheap diesel fuel 
i myself was a critic collor said i shared doubts about 
the high cost of production and deficiency of supply 
in 1989 high sugar prices on the international market led many 
cane growers to make sugar instead of alcohol suddenly there 
wasnt enough alcohol fuel 
long lines formed at service stations and motorists pushing 
alcohol cars that had run out of fuel became a common sight 
popular tv gameshow host fausto silva poked fun at the 
proalcohol slogan joking on his weekly program alcohol cars 
someday youll push one 
the government was forced to import alcohol it cut the price 
advantage of alcohol over gasoline to 25 percent added gasoline to 
alcohol and reduced the alcohol content in gasohol in most cities 
only sao paulo brazils most populous city kept a higher 
alcohol mix to reduce air pollution the cane fuel produces half 
the carbon monoxide of gasoline and no harmful hydrocarbons 
sales of alcohol cars plummeted below 5 percent of the market in 
july 
now while alcohol has gotten a reprive because of the gulf 
crisis jacy mendonca president of the national auto makers 
association warned it might not be lasting or significant 
added borges of copersucar the problem is that diesel fuel is 
very cheap less than half the price of gasoline and thats a 
very strong incentive to use it in every vehicle you can 
collor who took office in march abolished the governments 
sugar and alcohol institute widely seen as inefficient and 
corrupt to guarantee the alcohol supply cane producers must now 
get government permission to export 
proalcohol also will get funds for research to attain full 
economic viability he said 
society should have a positive view of proalcohol collor 
said it is a successful project that cannot be tampered with

most days abdel raouf abu assab sits at the 
door of his souvenir shop in jerusalems old city smoking his 
water pipe and waiting for tourists 
these days he waits in vain 
since the gulf crisis there is almost no business at all 
abu assab complained 
although israel is hundreds of miles from the persian gulf the 
headlines created by iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait have scared 
away travelers from the holy land government and industry 
officials said 
some hotels in arab east jerusalem largely dependent on 
christian visitors from the west say 80 percent of their september 
bookings were canceled hotel managers fear the traditional 
christmas traffic will be down sharply too 
in jewish areas it is more difficult to judge the impact of the 
gulf crisis because foreigners are just beginning to arrive to 
celebrate the high holidays in israel 
jerusalems hilton hotel was fully booked for rosh hashana the 
jewish new year and for the eightday feast of the tabernacles on 
oct 411 
motti verses a spokesman for the hotel said that after that 
we havent suffered massive cancellations but for sure people are 
hesitating to book 
tel aviv travel agent harry kalman said business travel was 
continuing but that holiday business was suffering 
we get telexes every day from germany holland denmark 
kalman said they want to know if it is safe to come there 
have been a lot of cancellations 
tourism is one of israels highest foreign exchange earners 
netting about 18 billion a year the government says last year 
14 million tourists arrived and the government had hoped for a 
record 2 million this year 
those predictions now seem too optimistic 
moti debi director of israels bengurion international 
airport reported a 15 percent drop in the number of passengers who 
passed through the airport in the first two weeks of september 
saying to my great sorrow the gulf crisis has caused a sharp 
decrease in the movement of passengers 
yossi shoval spokesman for israels tourism ministry also 
blamed the slowdown on israel being tarred with the same brush as 
the gulf 
we are 1300 kilometers 800 miles from baghdad but in the 
perception of the tv viewer we are right there shoval 
complained 
shoval said he believed neighboring countries such as egypt 
turkey and greece also would suffer a drop in tourism from the gulf 
crisis egypt for example has reported overall tourism is off 40 
percent since august 
in arab east jerusalem the timing of the gulf crisis is 
particularly cruel most hotels had only recently begun to recover 
from a sharp drop in visitors during the first two years of the 
palestinian uprising against israeli occupation of the west bank 
and gaza strip 
fuad abul hajj general manager of the national palace hotel in 
arab east jerusalem said an average of 85 percent of his hotels 
108 rooms were occupied in march april and may much higher than 
last year 
now we have had so many cancellations 80 percent of our 
september bookings abul hajj said 
he said christian tour groups also were backing out of 
reservations made for october and november the runup season to 
christmas 
there is nothing we can do he said with resignation how 
can you expect people to come to the middle east with that kind of 
crisis in the gulf 
souvenir salesman abu assab concurred when there is 
stability there are tourists he said when there is fear 
they go away 
even governmentsponsored events have not been immune to the 
gulf crisis 
onethird of the guests invited to the opening of the israel 
museums new modern art wing sept 3 failed to show including the 
family of the principal american benefactor 
twenty of the 90 american jews who were to be part of the 
prime ministers mission of major contributors in august canceled 
their trips 
the israeli tourism industry faced an added problem this week 
the finance ministry has recommended tourism services be subjected 
to a 16 percent tax to help raise money for the soviet immigrants 
a committee is studying the proposal 
it is coming at a particularly bad time said moshe amir 
managing director of the israeli hotel association we face 
strong competition from other countries in the middle east and 
raising prices could really hurt

as july ended egypt was celebrating a 
tourism boom with no end in sight almost 3 million visitors last 
year and officials foresaw visions of at least 5 million by 1995 
egypt finally was returning as an international tourist mecca 
after years of middle east uncertainty that had devastated an 
industry as old as the pyramids 
then on aug 2 iraq invaded kuwait 
tourism is an industry sensitive to regional politics said 
fuad sultan egypts tourism minister if youre scared to travel 
to a country you dont come 
and many arent overall tourism is down 40 percent tourism 
from the united states has dried up almost overnight holy land 
tours to egypt and israel are being canceled en masse 
one man saddam hussein has managed to convince the world 
that the whole middle east is embroiled in a holy war moslems 
killing christians another crusade sultan said 
in one day saddam hussein undid what we took five years to 
build a large american tourist market he convinced tourists that 
god and satan were slugging it out on the streets of cairo that 
christians would be killed if they came to a moslem country 
what rubbish 
sultan said his envoys are spreading the word that egypt is 
safe 1000 miles from iraq 
every tourist who doesnt come here because of this mans 
echoes his mouthing off is letting saddam hussein win he said 
annual tourist figures calculated every july were being 
readied for public release at the time of the iraqi invasion 
sultan said 28 million visitors deposited more than 25 billion 
into egypts debtridden economy an alltime high 
almost 150000 americans and nearly 12 million europeans 
visited egypt in 1989 
sultan said cancellations were few early in august the industry 
was in good shape because of a large number of welltodo arab 
families spending the summer in cairo prepaid western tour groups 
also still came 
but by this month officials feared the worst as they looked 
ahead to the beginning of egypts tourist season in october 
we went to work to pick up european tourists to make up for 
the disappearing americans sultan said 
we knew that people werent coming because they were scared 
we realized there is nothing to be done for a tourist who is 
panicked afraid he cant get back home if fighting occurs 
but there is something we can do for a tourist who wants to 
come but has a few doubts we can persuade him to come this is 
whats happening we are taking steps to reassure the 
americans they should really come ahead 
alia noor is the cairobased national sales manager for the 
hilton hotel chain she said american cancellations are running 
about 50 percent so far but that her staff is on the telephone 
daily to ensure that european charter flights dont cancel 
so far its worked she said we keep telling people to 
come here and see for yourself cairos great 
hassan kamy head of a large egyptian tourist company blamed 
sensationalism in the foreign news media for slanting middle east 
events toward cairo 
were a long way from iraq from the action kamy said 
nothings happning here but the media particularly the 
american media have sensationalized whats happening in egypt by 
200 percent at least 
were suffering i keep saying to other travel agents we must 
get out call our agents around the world tell them egypt is fine 
bring the people 
tension in the middle east affects tourism according to the 
nationality of the tourist he said 
most europeans have come despite the problems the germans are 
great theyre stubborn they come anyhow the asians are far away 
and plan and pay ahead so theyre still coming kamy said 
but he said there are two critical areas international 
conferences and americans 
conferences forget them and the americans weve been in 
touch with our american travel agencies they say they want to come 
ahead even with smaller groups but nobody will come

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher monday on the chicago board of trade as surging energy 
prices fanned inflation fears 
crude oil for nearterm delivery soared above 39 a barrel 
monday in reaction to warlike rhetoric from iraqi leader saddam 
hussein over the weekend 
when you see 39 crude maybe the attitude is that grain 
prices are a little too cheap here said gerald zusel manager of 
balfour maclaine corps trading floor operations at the board of 
trade 
the runup in oil prices overshadowed such bearish factors as 
slack export demand for us grains and forecasts for favorable 
growing conditions in the corn belt 
youre looking at 70s and 80s in most of the midwest this 
week zusel said some of this grain thats a little late in 
maturing should get pushed along 
at the close wheat futures were 4 cents to 6 cents higher with 
december at 275 a bushel corn was cent lower to 3 cents 
higher with december at 228 a bushel oats were cent to 1 
cents lower with december at 112 a bushel soybeans were 1 cent 
lower to 2 cents higher with november at 614 a bushel

a high american express co official 
orchestrated a smear campaign of edmond j safra the swiss banker 
who had a fallingout with the financial services giant the wall 
street journal said monday in an investigative report 
harry l freeman then an executive vice president with close 
ties to company chairman james d robinson iii approved the hiring 
of a private detective and a public relations executive who 
investigated safra and then spread rumors about him the journal 
said 
company officials privately blamed the incident on a handful 
of unnamed lowlevel employees the frontpage story said 
but a lengthy investigation by this newspaper reveals evidence 
suggesting the effort to smear mr safra was in fact overseen from 
mr freemans office only steps away from mr robinsons 
false news stories about safra began to surface in early 1988 
linking him to drug dealers money laundering and the mafia the 
journal said 
the newspaper said there was no concrete evidence that robinson 
knew of the campaign against safra although the american express 
chairman had regular contact with one of freemans operatives 
susan cantor 
last year american express publicly apologized to safra 
admitting that people acting on its behalf had tried to discredit 
safra american express paid 8 million to charities of safras 
choice to make amends 
freeman later retired from the company accepting responsibility 
for mistakes made on my watch 
larry armour an american express spokesman said monday that 
the journal story discussed events that took place at least a 
year ago we said at that time what needed to be said in terms of 
the steps we took we admitted that something did indeed go awry 
we apologized about it 
armour continued we ran a very extensive internal 
investigation that was run by the audit committee of the board of 
directors they came back with recommendations on policy and 
procedures which we have put in place 
its senseless to respond to old news no matter how 
colorfully someone chooses to repackage it armour said 
the journal said it gathered its information from interviews 
with dozens of people involved in the safra affair including 
journalists private detectives and 15 current and former american 
express executives the story headlined the vendetta was 
written by reporter bryan burrough 
the journal said american express and safra began to fall out 
soon after robinson decided in 1983 to buy safras genevabased 
trade development bank and combine it with american express bank 
the styles of the two men differed sharply and in 1984 safra 
resigned from the company the split between safra and robinson 
deepened during negotiations on a settlement package and matters 
grew worse as american express bank officials began to suspect that 
safra who was planning to begin another swiss bank in 1988 was 
hiring away american express employees the journal said 
robert smith the former chairman of american express bank told 
the journal he had informed robinson he had hired detectives to 
follow the former american express workers 
smith told the journal he had become obsessed with stopping 
safra and that his aides began looking for any kind of evidence 
that might be used against safra in a possible internal revenue 
service probe 
anger against safra spread to other american express executives 
the journal said and the company tried in vain to block his 
attempt to get a new banking license in switzerland in 1987 
in 1988 after he had opened his new bank articles began to 
appear in newspapers in europe and south america linking safra to 
the mafia nowdeposed panamanian dictator manuel noriega south 
american drug traffickers the cia and the irancontra scandal 
the articles which threatened safras reputation for honesty 
raised questions in the minds of his aides about a possible 
connection to american express the journal said 
a first link to american express was found during the course of 
a libel suit safra filed against a french newspaper minute the 
journal said one of safras lawyers found that a life magazine 
article about the mafia had been faxed to minute from american 
express headquarters in new york the journal said 
investigators working for safras lawyers including new york 
attorney stanley arkin eventually found that the source of the 
articles was antonio greco an elusive businessman with homes in 
spain and new york city 
in reality greco was an investigator working for american 
express the journal said greco also had an arrest record in the 
united states and italy going back to 1962 and had been convicted 
on charges including theft conspiracy and handling stolen goods 
the newspaper said 
safras investigators also discovered the greco had a link at 
american express susan cantor now a senior vice president at 
american express bank and before that an employee in the american 
express public relations office working under harry freeman the 
journal said 
the journal said freeman had been a willing ear when 
american express bank officials began voicing their concerns about 
safra freeman had a penchant for unorthodox projects the 
newspaper said 
freeman was convinced that safra wanted to destroy american 
express bank and began collecting rumors about him the journal 
said 
the newspaper said freeman initially used ms cantor a former 
abc news employee to gather information on safra but her task 
evolved to spreading rumors and negative news stories about safra 
ms cantor made a number of trips to europe to find information 
about safra and then to disseminate the false stories the journal 
said 
ms cantor also worked closely with robinson helping plan his 
trips to latin america and later mediating a dispute between 
american express bank and american expresss shearson lehman hutton 
brokerage subsidiary 
in a statement to the journal ms cantor said she never 
intended or sought to dissseminate false information concerning 
edmond safra to anyone and i never instructed asked or engaged 
anyone to spread such information

the presidents of the us and 
australian coal miners unions signed an agreement monday pledging 
cooperation in dealing with multinational corporations 
the agreement signed at the united mine workers 100th 
anniversary convention stemmed from the 10month pittston co 
strike in virginia west virginia and kentucky 
during that strike which ended last february the united 
mineworkers federation of australia told japanese buyers that 
australian miners would not help fill coal contracts which pittston 
was unable to meet 
union officials credit the australian miners position with 
causing japanese customers to put pressure on pittston helping to 
end the strike 
that was clearly an incident which sent shock waves through 
the international community said john maitland general 
president of the united mineworkers federation of australia 
the agreement signed monday pledges that mine workers in the 
united states canada and australia many of whom work for the same 
global corporations will help each other stop those multinational 
companies from exploiting workers nation by nation maitland 
said 
umw president richard trumka said he signed the agreement so 
our two countries never scab on one another ever in the future 
the practical effect of the agreement however is not clear 
because us labor law prohibits secondary boycotts against 
companies because of a strike against a different operation 
the convention which began sept 17 ends tuesday with 
addresses by us labor secretary elizabeth dole and united 
steelworkers union president lynn williams

chase manhattan corps announcement that it 
will slash its dividend and eliminate 5000 jobs could signal 
impending cutbacks by other major banks analysts said monday 
the nations secondlargest bank said friday it would halve its 
dividend this quarter because it planned to set aside more than 
650 million by sept 30 to bolster reserves for loans that may go 
bad most of the loans financed commercial real estate 
but analysts said real estate is just one trouble spot for major 
banks as the economy deteriorates 
among other concerns are the loans that helped finance the wave 
of corporate buyouts in the 1980s as business slows at the 
companies acquired through these leveraged buyouts the likelihood 
that the loans will be repaid in full diminishes analysts say 
one industry source who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
chase may be just the first among top banks to scale back the 
source said citibank the nations largest and chemical banking 
corp no 6 both could be forced to retrench due to low levels of 
reserves compared with potentially troubled loans 
other major banks are going to watch closely to see whether 
the dividend cut hurts chases standing among the financial 
community before considering following suit said analyst mark 
lynch of bear stearns amp co 
one major bank manufacturers hanover corp issued a statement 
that it has every reason to believe its dividend will remain 
unchanged 
and its not just the huge money center banks that are 
hurting some regional banks particularly in new england the 
southeast and the midwest have been troubled for months as the 
strong real estate market of the 1980s went bust 
two smaller banks said friday they would cut their dividends as 
they prepare for tougher times midlantic corp of edison nj 
slashed its dividend in half as it announced it expects to lose at 
least 150 million this quarter southeast banking corp of miami 
said it would eliminate its dividend entirely this quarter due to a 
loss it projects will be 87 million 
a stable history of dividend payments is one of the key reasons 
investors put their money in bank stocks chase became the first 
major new york bank to cut its dividend in at least 15 years lynch 
said 
not surprisingly wall street reacted severely to the news of 
the bank dividend cuts chases stock lost 1 a share friday and an 
additional 162 monday to close at 1112 earlier this year 
it was as high as 3075 
among other bank stocks monday citicorp fell 50 cents to close 
at 1525 chemical bank lost 187 to end at 1512 and 
manufacturers hanover slipped 25 cents to 2275 
the decline in bank stocks was blamed in part for a drop in the 
entire market friday and monday 
the bond market also has shown concern prices of notes to raise 
cash issued by citicorp chemical bank and manufacturers hanover 
all dropped monday 
there is a lot of hysteria and uncertainty as to what the 
future holds for banking its scaring the heck out of everyone 
said stephen berman who follows banking for the investment firm 
county natwest usa 
berman said the concern stems in part from the fact that banks 
are a microcosm of the economy as the economy deteriorates some 
investors fear banks will go down with it 
the fear about the health of banks also arises from the fact 
that little is publicly disclosed about what banks hold in their 
loan portfolios 
the banks are a blind pool of assets lynch said people 
are assuming that the worst of everything is in the loan 
portfolios 
at the same time regulators are stepping up pressure on banks 
to have adequate provisions to cover bad loans especially in light 
of the savings and loan debacle 
but analysts said some of the concern about the health of banks 
is misplaced many banks already have put aside enough money to 
cover potentially bad loans and they shouldnt need to scale back 
unless the nation enters a long recession 
however a number of analysts said citicorp may be in a riskier 
position than is generally believed 
the party line at citicorp is that theyre more conservative 
than other banks the level of problem loans doesnt hold the same 
degree of loss potential i have some difficulty with that 
berman said 
he said that as of june 30 citicorp had put aside enough money 
to cover 25 percent of the loans it identified as potentially 
troubled by contrast by the end of this quarter chase will have 
50 percent of its potentially bad loans covered by reserves he 
said

representing ronson said ronson had been advised he had 
substantial grounds for appeal

on bail so he can undergo surgery he was to be sentenced tuesday 
the jury found the four had secretly and illegally rigged the 
stock market to inflate the price of guinness shares when the 
company successfully battled the argyll supermarket chain for 
control of distillers 
the 113day trial at southwark crown court heard that the 25 
million pound or 46 million stock support operation involved the 
payment by guinness of indemnities against share dealing losses and 
success fees after the bid came off 
saunders and three other britons will stand trial later this 
year on further charges arising from the guinness affair

oil prices jumped to near 40 per barrel on the 
futures market monday about double the price before iraq invaded 
kuwait and close to the level of cash prices paid 10 years ago 
during the iranian revolution 
wholesale unleaded gasoline and home heating oil shot over 1 
per gallon as the market responded to amplified fears about the 
persian gulf crisis 
if war breaks out and affects saudi arabia prices could go 
much higher said philip l dodge an analyst with nomura 
securities international inc that seems to be the expectation 
now 
after peaking at 3920 per barrel in the afternoon light sweet 
crude for november delivery settled up 282 at 3825 per barrel 
a new record on the new york mercantile exchange where oil futures 
have been traded since 1983 
crude opened the day at 3720 surpassing a record set friday 
then quickly rose above the 38 mark where it stayed for the rest 
of the trading session 
the sharp rise had speculators guessing that oil futures might 
soon hit the 40 mark matching the cash price paid in 1980 
trader ed kevelson at dean witter reynolds inc said the new 
highs were coming in fairly light volume as mondays rapid rise 
scared off some investors 
the surge was attributed to saberrattling from iraqi president 
saddam hussein who indicated he might launch an allout war 
possibly by attacking saudi oil fields rather than allow the un 
trade embargo to strangle iraq recent estimates have put the 
price of oil at 60 per barrel if a shooting war breaks out 
meanwhile stock prices were broadly lower monday in response to 
the gulf and other factors affecting the economy especially the 
precarious position of the nations banks the dow jones industrial 
average was down 5941 at 245297 
oils dramatic rise helped jack up the price of refined 
petroleum products which had been moving steadily higher recently 
on fears of supply shortages 
home heating oil was up 671 cents to 1039 per gallon for 
october delivery unleaded gasoline rose 678 cents to 1042 per 
gallon for october contracts 
gasoline futures last traded above 1 on aug 24 while heating 
oil futures had not been that high since the price spike last 
december 
natural gas also rose sharply monday with november contracts up 
64 cents to 1936 per 1000 cubic feet 
analysts said 40 oil could push up inflation while prompting 
bigger increases for gasoline prices at the pump 
the nationwide lundberg survey of 18500 gas stations found that 
the average price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump has hit an 
alltime high of slightly more than 138 slightly higher than a 
previous record of just under 138 set in march 1981 
still when prices are adjusted for inflation americans are 
paying far less for energy than they paid in the early 1980s 
dodge the nomura analyst said oil would have to hit 57 per 
barrel to be as high as the 40 price in 1980 during the iranian 
revolution 
but pump prices have not kept pace with crude during the runup 
and could accelerate 
forty dollars for crude oil is up about 20 from where it was 
before all this unpleasantness got started dodge said that 
20 increase is about 48 cents per gallon and so far the price of 
gasoline is only up about half of that it eventually could go up 
another 25 cents 
oil trading at 2154 per barrel on aug 1 has been on the 
rise since iraq invaded kuwait the following day but the market is 
feeling especially pinched now that the boycott of iraqi and 
kuwaiti oil is taking effect 
basically the whole world now has gotten the last of the 
iraqi and kuwaiti crude said annlouise hittle a senior oil 
analyst with shearson lehman brothers inc 
oils previous high price on the mercantile exchange was 3560 
per barrel which came on friday to cap a string of records set 
last week

corroon amp black corp and willis faber plc said 
monday they would pay corroon and black shareholders a special 
dividend that effectively sweetens the terms of the insurance 
brokers proposed merger 
the extra dividend of 250 a share would be payable subject to 
the completion of the merger following a special corroon amp black 
shareholders meeting oct 4 
new yorkbased corroon amp black rejected last week an offer of 
840 million or 40 a share from chicagobased aon corp intended 
to spoil corroons 2monthold plan to merge with britains willis 
faber 
corroon amp black rejected the aon offer despite its being worth 
more than plan to merger with willis faber which values corroon amp 
black at more than 750 million or about 3350 a share 
the dividend announced monday would add 51 million to the total 
price of the deal 
the corroon amp black board of directors argued that the tie with 
willis faber would give the company greater longterm strength 
particularly because of the british brokers strong position in the 
london insurance market 
under the merger accord willis faber will issue 78 of its 
shares for each of the 205 million corroon amp black shares 
outstanding 
willis fabers stock closed at 214 pence or 402 a share on 
londons stock exchange while corroon amp black stock rose 25 cents 
to 2950 on the new york stock exchange trading monday

gold futures prices roared above 400 an ounce monday as soaring 
energy prices crumbling stock prices and a slumping dollar renewed 
investor interest in precious metals 
on other commodity markets coffee prices sagged grains and 
soybeans were mostly higher cattle futures fell and pork futures 
were mixed 
gold settled 1360 to 1530 higher on new yorks commodity 
exchange with the contract for delivery in september at 403 a troy 
ounce the highest level in a month 
silver futures ended 125 cents to 137 cents higher with 
september at 4915 a troy ounce 
demand for gold was triggered mainly by an enormous jump in oil 
prices and a nearly 60point plunge in the dow jones industrials 
average largely in reaction to heightened fears of war in the 
middle east analysts said 
iraqs leaders warned over the weekend that they would launch an 
allout war before allowing the un trade embargo to strangle 
their nation 
in addition to the twin threats of greater inflation and 
international turmoil two traditional buy signals for gold 
analysts said precious metals were supported by a further decline 
in the dollars value against other major currencies 
james steel an energy and preciousmetals analyst with refco 
inc in new york noted the dollar had strengthened during the oil 
crises of the 1970s 
other oilimporting countries like japan and germany have seen 
their currencies appreciate steel said this could indicate 
that in this time of rising energy prices the world has more 
confidence in their economies than in ours 
analysts said the largescale selling of physical gold that kept 
a lid on prices last week appeared to have abated which may have 
encouraged speculators to buy gold futures 
in energy trading on the new york mercantile exchange light 
sweet crude oil futures settled 45 cents to 282 higher with 
november at 3825 a barrel heating oil was 175 cents to 671 
cents higher with october at 10392 a gallon unleaded gasoline 
was 4 cents to 678 cents higher with october at 10423 a gallon 
coffee futures plunged on new yorks coffee sugar amp cocoa 
exchange after brazil the worlds largest coffee producer called 
for a oneyear extension of an international pact that containes no 
coffee export limits 
several other large coffeeproducing countries including 
olombia have been pushing for a return to export quotas to boost 
prices 
coffee settled 225 cents to 35 cents lower with december at 94 
cents a pound 
most grain and soybean futures rose on the chicago board of 
trade as surging energy prices fanned inflation fears 
the runup in oil prices overshadowed such bearish factors as 
slack export demand for us grains and forecasts for favorable 
growing conditions in the corn belt 
in a report released after the close the agriculture department 
said corn and soybean development continues to lag behind the 
normal pace fiftythree percent of the corn crop was mature as of 
sunday compared with a 76 percent average for that date 41 percent 
of the soybean crop was at the leafdrop stage compared with a 57 
percent norm 
wheat futures ended 4 cents to 5 cents higher with december at 
275 a bushel corn was cent to 3 cents higher with december

the savings and loan bailout agency needs to 
do a better job of monitoring the private contractors it hires 
congressional auditors warned monday 
the general accounting office told a senate subcommittee that 
the resolutions trust corps internal controls to monitor 
contractors have not been as good as we would like 
progress has been made toward developing a management 
structure to mitigate its vulnerability to fraud waste and 
abuse comptroller general charles a bowsher told the senate 
governmental affairs subcommittee on federal services 
but he added more needs to be done 
he said gao auditors had visited the agencys southwest regional 
office and said we found no detailed instructions procedures or 
other guidance to help regional personnel monitor the activities of 
contractors 
auditors also said the regional office visited as well as two 
subordinate offices had no plans in place for monitoring the 
performance of contractors and that the broad guidance distributed 
from agency headquarters was inadequate 
lamar c kelly jr director of the bailout agencys asset and 
real estate management division said the 13monthold agencys 
officials are not yet satisfied with its system of overseeing 
contractors but added were 75 percent there we will be 100 
percent by the end of the year 
the agency is also making progress on hiring its own employees 
it has a staff of 5400 of a planned 6200 kelly said 
sen david pryor dark chairman of the subcommittee called 
the rtc the fastest growing contractor and consultant industry in 
the world 
the rtc plans to spend 800 million next year on service 
contracts it plans to hire outside firms to manage up to 30 
billion in problem real estate

the us tobacco industry recorded a 
trade surplus of 25 billion for the first half of 1990 an 
increase of 554 million from the same period last year an 
industry group said monday 
the united states exported 295 billion dollars worth of 
tobacco products and raw leaf during the first six months of 1990 
according to thomas slane a vicepresident of the tobacco 
merchants association the bulk 22 billion was finished 
products including shipments of 737 billion cigarettes worth 
205 billion 
the biggest markets for usmade cigarettes were belgium and 
japan each accounting for about 29 percent of exports 
the united states imported 463 million of tobacco during the 
first half of the year most of which was bulk leaf slane said 
the united states ran an overall trade deficit of 411 billion 
during the first half of the year 
slane attributed the increased surplus to the lowering of trade 
barriers against american cigarettes 
the opening of cigarette markets in japan taiwan and south 
korea to us exporters has generated an additional 287 million 
for us tobacco farmers slane said

honda motor co ltd will equip all of 
its cars with driver and passengerside air bags by the 1994 model 
year the companys top executive said monday 
nobuhiko kawamoto who became the japanese companys president 
and chief executive officer last june told reporters the devices 
will replace automatic seat belts now on its cars 
kawamoto in his first us tour as head of honda declined to 
speculate how many honda and acura cars the company would sell in 
the united states by the time air bags became standard equipment 
through the first eight months of this year honda sold 593508 
cars up 112 percent from the same time last year 
currently chrysler corp equips all of its usmade cars with 
driverside air bags but cars it receives from other companies 
notably mitsubishi motors corp do not have the safety devices 
general motors corp said it will expand the use of driver and 
passenger side air bags to all of its domestically designed cars by 
late 1995 for the 1996 model year ford motor co said by the 
mid1990s it would equip all of its cars with driver and passenger 
side air bags 
on others matters kawamoto said monday 
honda plans no further plant expansions in the united states in 
the near future he said the company will focus on its us 
research and development operations and increase the amount of 
usmade components in its cars assembled in hondas two ohio 
plants past the current level of about 75 percent 
the expansion of production capacity is the second 
priority he said hondas marysville ohio plant is running 
near to its capacity while its new east liberty ohio factory is 
slowly increasing its production toward capacity 
no decision has been made on whether honda will build a minivan 
for the us or asian markets 
we still have many things to do like the accord wagon 
kawamoto said honda will introduce a station wagon version of its 
popular accord sedan this fall for the 1991 model year 
like other automakers honda opposes legislation in congress 
now mandating a 20percent increase in auto manufacturers 
corporate average fuel economy ratings by the turn of the century 
its been speculated that the minimum fueleconomy figures could 
reach as much as 40 mpg by that time under the legislation 
automakers have said raising the fuel economy ratings of cars by 
making them smaller lighter and less powerful runs against the 
grain of what us customers want 
i think the target seems to be from a technical point of 
view very challenging kawamoto said

the senate narrowly rejected a proposal monday 
night to aid autoworkers laid off in any required shift by 
automakers to highermileage cars 
in debate on a bill to require cars to average 40 miles per 
gallon the senate voted 4946 to reject an amendment by sen paul 
simon dill that would have provided special unemployment 
assistance for those workers 
a vote on whether to close off debate on the bill was scheduled 
for tuesday 
the passage of this amendment will doom this bill declared 
sen slade gorton rwash a cosponsor 
later the senate agreed 5540 to a include in the legislation 
new incentives for automakers to produce vehicles that can run on 
alternative fuels such as methanol ethanol or natural gas the 
measure would allow manufacturers to claim credits against fuel 
efficiency requirements if they produce such vehicles 
similar fuel economy legislation has been introduced in the 
house but has yet to emerge from committee 
in earlier debate on the legislation opponents argued that the 
higher fuel economy requirements would be a death blow to the 
midsize family sedan and force automakers to produce only small 
cars 
sen richard bryan dnev chief sponsor of the legislation 
disputed such claims arguing higher fuel efficiency can be 
achieved without sacrificing the sixpassenger automobile 
it means smaller cars it means less safe cars declared 
sen donald riegle dmich who has led efforts to block 
consideration of the measure 
the legislations supporters maintained that manufacturers have 
shown in the past that they can come up with technologies to 
improve fuel efficiency greatly and still provide customers with a 
broad range of vehicle models 
in aiming to reduce the nations dependence on foreign oil the 
bill would would require cars to achieve on a fleet average 35 mpg 
by 1995 and 40 mpg by 2001 he said that would eventually save 28 
million barrels of oil daily 
the automakers have said they cant meet those goals without 
making cars dramatically smaller and stopping production of midsize 
and large vehicles 
bryan read statements by auto industry executives in the early 
1970s predicting the demise of the family sedan as a result of fuel 
efficiency requirements then under consideration 
that just didnt happen the sixpassenger vehicle is here 
just as it was before said bryan

the senate passed legislation monday night 
bringing older workers job benefits under the protective umbrella 
of the age discrimination in employment act 
the bill passed 941 and sent to the house was aimed at 
reversing the effects of a supreme court decision which held that 
employee benefits were not covered by the 1967 civil rights law 
only sen james mcclure ridaho voted against the measure 
this one supreme court ruling opened the door wide for 
potential discrimination in older workers health disability life 
insurance and severance benefits said sen john heinz rpa 
it did so by threatening or permitting the use of deferred 
compensation in the form of pension benefits to be converted to an 
unintended and counterproductive use heinz said the supreme 
court decision sanctions discrimination in benefits solely on the 
basis of a workers age without regard to who the worker is or 
what he contributes to the work force 
the legislation cleared the senate floor after its chief 
sponsors reached a compromise with opposition forces led by sen 
orrin hatch rutah 
hatch had voiced concern that folding employee benefits into the 
coverage of the age discrimination in employment act of 1967 would 
cause businesses to respond to this change by eliminating early 
retirement incentive programs programs that many older workers 
find very attractive 
the bill puts the senate on record as saying it intended the 
1967 law to prohibit arbitrary discrimination against older 
employees in the administration of benefit programs unless 
separate treatment of workers on the basis of age could be 
justified 
heinz said that if the supreme court decision had been left 
uncorrected by congress it could have led to premature exits 
from office and assembly lines by some of americas most valued 
employees 
the impetus for the legislation was the high courts ruling in a 
suit involving june betts a cincinnatiarea woman and employees 
retirement system of ohio 
ms betts was a speech pathologist in hamilton county ohio at 
61 she became disabled with alzheimers disease but was denied 
disability retirement because she was over 60 the ruling denied 
her an additional 200 a month

lockheed corp rejected texas financier 
harold simmons latest advances on monday saying his attempt to 
buy another 10 million shares of the companys stock was a ploy to 
take control on the cheap 
simmons who controls 198 percent of lockheeds stock lost a 
proxy battle in march for control of the calabasas califbased 
company the nations sixth largest military contractor 
he had asked lockheed to void its poison pill takeover 
defense under that provision if anyone buys more than 20 percent 
of lockheeds stock the company can sell new stock to other 
shareholders at a discount that would dilute simmons holdings 
making a takeover prohibitively expensive 
lockheeds board rejected simmons request to revoke the 
provision so his nl industries inc can buy 10 million shares at 
35 per share from lockheeds employee stock ownership plan or up 
to 350 million worth of stock in the open market that would give 
him control of 35 percent of the stock 
the directors did agree to suspend the poison pill if an offer 
meets certain conditions notably that it must be for 100 percent 
of the company be in cash and be approved by a majority of 
shareholders not counting the one making the offer 
reached by telephone in texas simmons declined to talk about 
lockheeds decision id really rather not comment until ive had 
a chance to study the whole thing he said 
like all defense contractors lockheed faces potentially tough 
times from spending cuts by the us government its stock closed 
up a fraction monday at 2575 far below the average 43 per share 
that simmons paid for his stake 
lockheed chairman daniel m tellep said its directors had met 
with simmons several times since march to brief him about the 
company 
simmons lockheed stock is now worth about 200 million less 
than he paid for it he maintains however that he is a longterm 
investor with no intention of selling even if the stock price rose 
sharply

cbs and abc hoping to build new franchises with 
news on weeknights each announced plans monday for latenight 
newscasts 
abcs effort which has yet to get final approval is the most 
ambitious 
but cbs halfhour show coanchored by charles kuralt and 
lesley tahl and starting at 1130 pm will be the first to join 
the latenight news wars it will premiere monday opposite abc 
news nightline series 
abcs predawn broadcast to run from 1 am to 6 am will 
start jan 7 if plans are approved said abc news vice president 
joanna bistany 
earlier monday abc said the newscast was definite but that was 
premature bistany said 
neither show has been given a title yet 
kuralt will anchor his part of the new cbs show here and 
continue as anchor of cbs sunday morning newcast stahl will 
anchor from washington and continue as moderator of face the 
nation on sundays 
like nightline which began when iran held hostages in the 
us embassy in 1979 the new cbs show is the outgrowth of a middle 
east crisis iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait that crisis has been 
examined in six cbs specials since aug 29 all called showdown 
in the gulf 
unlike nightline which usually tackles a single topic each 
night the new series will examine several topics each night 
through live interviews extended news segments and essays cbs 
news said 
it also will report the latest developments in the us and the 
middle east as long as the persian gulf crisis continues cbs said 
whether it will continue beyond january when cbs is scheduled 
to start latenight entertainment programming at 1130 pm 
depends on how well it is received by viewers cbs news president 
eric ober said 
but if it does well he said there is a possibility it will 
continue in the 1130 pm time slot with the new programming 
pushed up to a midnight start time 
cbs currently shows repeats of wiseguy at 1130 pm edt 
but those will start a halfhour later when the new cbs news 
program begins 
abcs potential broadcast was created in response to requests 
from the networks more than 200 affiliates which now air 
syndicated programs movies or go dark during the predawn hours 
with two anchors to be named later the abc broadcast would have 
live and taped segments domestic and international news sports 
and weather in 30minute packages 
the main competition for abcs predawn show would be the cable 
news network in january nbc news will start a new operation the 
24hour nbc news channel serving that networks affiliates with 
international national and regional news for use in their local 
newscasts 
nbc said monday the operation will be based in charlotte nc 
cnn has been considering the idea of a latenight interview show 
like abcs nightline but it has yet to make a decision 
abcs new series also will rival the far smaller all news 
channel another 24hour news service begun last november and 
coowned by conus communications and viacom it serves broadcasters 
in 25 markets conus says 
although cbs news has had nightwatch a taped interview 
show competing in the predawn hours since october 1982 its new 
halfhour series marks its entry in a time period where 
entertainment has flopped for years 
two years ago cbs put pat sajaks talk show on at 1130 pm 
facing nbcs latenight ratings champ johnny carsons tonight 
show nightline and arsenio halls syndicated show 
but the pat sajak show proved a ratings bomb and was 
cancelled in april after 15 months on the air
