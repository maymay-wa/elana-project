eleven days ago the rev ted coleman 
thought removing nancy cruzans feeding tube was immoral and cruel 
but the chaplain at the clinic where the woman lies after nearly 
eight years in a persistent vegetative state told his congregation 
sunday that now hes not so sure her parents were wrong to fight 
for her right to die 
im struggling like ive never had to struggle before 
coleman told parishioners at the first christian church disciples 
of christ 
coleman 51 doubles as chaplain at the missouri rehabilitation 
center where ms cruzan is in a vegetative state doctors say is 
irreversible the 33yearold woman remained in deteriorating 
condition late sunday 
a judge on dec 14 gave ms cruzans parents permission to have 
the tube removed 
until then coleman said he firmly believed that ending ms 
cruzans life was wrong 
hed said he never met joe and joyce cruzan until that day but 
it didnt matter because he believed ending their daughters life 
was unconscionable even if there was no hope of her recovering 
as recently as tuesday when 19 people were arrested for 
bursting into the hospital and trying to reach ms cruzans room to 
reconnect her feeding tube coleman admitted he sympathized with 
the antieuthanasia demonstrators 
but after getting to know the cruzans through daily visits and 
giving more thought to the righttodie issue coleman said hes 
reevaluated his position 
as a minister of the gospel ive studied and been taught that 
certain truths are always black or white he said as i deal 
more with this issue im not sure it is black or white 
when he kisses his two teenage daughters good night coleman 
said he puts himself in the cruzans position 
i cant help but ask myself what would i do if one of them 
suddenly was in the same medical condition as nancy sometimes i 
think we are too quick to judge others when we dont know what we 
would do in the same situation 
coleman said he now believes the roundtheclock presence of 
demonstrators outside the clinic does little more than further 
burden and irritate the cruzans 
they are caring people who have struggled with this issue for 
a long time they deserve to have time to grieve the loss of their 
daughter which they havent had coleman said 
snow subzero cold and legal setbacks in their attempts to force 
the state to resume feeding ms cruzan have reduced the number of 
fulltime demonstrators at the hospital from about 15 to just three 
sunday night 
but the strain on the cruzans which began with nancys car 
crash on jan 11 1983 is becoming apparent as her death nears 
on sunday joe cruzan stepped past police officers who screen 
visitors at the hospital entrance and went onto the lawn to tear up 
a banner reading joe please feed nancy 
i got your message and i got your sign he shouted 
coleman asked the 280 members of his congregation to pray for 
the cruzan family asking either for a miracle or a painless and 
swift death for nancy 
he also asked them to pray for him 
im struggling mightily with this issue and i know others are 
struggling too he said

with exports to the united states and 
other parts of the world sagging south korea is eager to do 
business with the soviet union 
evidence of south korean presence is visible almost as soon as a 
visitor steps off the plane at sheremetyevo airport in moscow the 
1500 baggage carts are emblazoned with signs advertising samsung 
a korean conglomerate 
visitors can rent hyundai automobiles made in south korea buy 
koreanmade fur coats and see koreansponsored quiz shows on 
television they pass billboards advertising korean companies 
placed strategically near the kremlin 
south korea has washing machines refrigerators televisions 
videos sewing machines soap shoes electronics and dozens of 
other moderately priced consumer goods the soviets need south 
koreans hope the soviets have the kinds of advanced technology they 
need and cant get elsewhere 
experts say the ultimate goal is the transfer from moscow to 
seoul of technologies that either the united states and japan will 
nt provide or are too expensive in the west 
among them are core technology in lasers space biotechnology 
nuclear fusion electronics and composite and superhard materials 
with applications that could range from a new kind of automobile 
brake to gene therapy 
does the soviet union have usable high technologies no one 
seems to know the koreans are still looking at the wares 
searching for nuggets a western expert said 
analyst kim byongkuk said the cardinal inducement for 
koreansoviet economic cooperation stems from the fact that both 
nations are in a position to offer what the other party needs 
most 
president roh taewoo visited moscow two weeks ago less than 
three months after the governments established normal relations he 
said his summit talks with mikhail s gorbachev heralded a new era 
of mutual prosperity 
the soviet union has advanced science and technology we need 
and we can provide consumer goods and facilities roh said 
north korea assailed the visit and indirectly criticized its 
soviet allies but with little effect 
a day after roh returned the science and technology ministry 
announced that 281 soviet technologies were expected to be 
transferred for commercial application including those for nuclear 
fusion and fast breeder reactors 
in return south korea is to provide production technology for 
consumer goods 
the bank of korea said 91 million had been approved for 
investment by middecember in january south korea is expected to 
complete an economic cooperation and loan package said to total 3 
billion 
trade between the two countries doubled in 1989 to 600 million 
it is expected to exceed 1 billion in 1990 and south korean 
officials have predicted levels of up to 10 billion within five 
years 
after years of selling copycat items at low prices because of 
low wages the south koreans are trying to catch up 
technologically to compete in an atmosphere of rising labor and 
production costs they need to make more advanced products of 
higher quality 
as if to emphasize the point the last stop roh made in the 
soviet union was the ioffe physicotechnical institute in leningrad 
japan is making a lot of money by dominating the worlds 
semiconductor market he was quoted as saying if we combine 
soviet advanced technology and south koreas application know how 
we can split the profit 
many south koreans feel the soviets are using this country as 
bait to lure a bigger fish japan into committing billions of 
dollars to longrange development of soviet natural resources 
high technology is especially urgent for south korea said 
dr rhee sangwoo a specialist in public policy but for japan 
its meaningless they dont need soviet high technology south 
korea is bait to fish japan 
japan has held off because of a territorial dispute over a group 
of islands and because it views investment in the soviet union as 
risky observers feel development of close commercial relations 
between moscow and seoul will make japanese businessmen uneasy and 
more susceptible to soviet advances 
among the technologies south korea wants most are those for high 
definition television which displays pictures that are stunning in 
color and detail 
the soviet union is said to possess the technology but has been 
unable to build and market it high definition television already 
is a multibilliondollar industry in japan and is beginning to 
catch on in the united states 
daewoo corp parent company of the giant daewoo group 
conglomerate recently signed two jointventure contracts with the 
soviets with the aim of commercializing new soviet technologies 
the contracts are with the ioffe institute and the soviet 
ministry of atomic energy and industry the technologies include 
those applicable to high definition television new methods to cast 
aluminum nuclear membranes for making work spaces germfree and 
technology for treating industrial waste daewoo said

from a terrifying murder rate to appalling 
infant mortality sharon pratt dixon will confront problems that 
would daunt the nations savviest public official when she becomes 
mayor of the nations capital 
but the woman who takes office jan 2 is the very opposite of 
an experienced government bureaucrat and her response to the 
challenges will set the tone for life in a city anxious for an end 
to turbulence after outgoing mayor marion barrys highly publicized 
drug and legal difficulties 
dixon 46 and a former utility company executive swept to 
victory in november in her firstever political campaign she had 
been the first candidate to call on barry to give up his job and 
campaigned on a pledge to root out waste and corruption in city 
government 
last month a blueribbon panel that examined the citys 
deteriorating financial situation recommended that 6000 government 
jobs be eliminated 
so far she isnt saying how shell proceed when she becomes the 
capital citys first woman mayor 
she wont have long to get going on that problem or any other 
the police force continues to grow toward a record level of 
5100 officers yet a record 471 people have been murdered this 
year many of them the result of the citys notorious drug trade 
homelessness public school difficulties chronic prison crowding 
an infant mortality rate higher than many third world countries 
these will be dixons to deal with as well 
solving these dilemmas will take money and the nations capital 
city is broke this years deficit of 100 million could double in 
the next fiscal year 
amidst the gloom are some signs of hope 
the departure of barry who is appealing his cocaine possession 
conviction and sixmonth prison sentence should mean a new spirit 
of goodwill among the city the congress and the bush 
administration 
the annual payment made to the city in lieu of taxes lost on 
federallyowned property has been frozen at 4305 million for five 
years in a visible symbol of congressional dissatisfaction with 
barry 
after a meeting with dixon last month house speaker thomas 
foley said the payment may soon be increased earlier this month 
transportation secretary samuel skinner praised dixon while 
awarding the city 19 million in federal highway funds barry was 
nowhere to be seen 
dixons nofrills style differs sharply from that of barry who 
made no secret of his love for limousines police escorts and other 
trappings of power 
last month the mayorelect said she would all but eliminate the 
24member roundtheclock police security detail that accompanied 
barry to all his official and private functions thats just not 
my style im not comfortable with it dixon said 
ms dixon divorced and the mother of two grown daughters has 
had a career as an electric company executive she also has served 
two terms as treasurer of the democratic national committee 
but her profile in national democratic politics aside she has 
scant experience in local government affairs 
the longawaited study of the citys bureaucracy gives dixon 
who has promised to pare 2000 workers from the city payroll even 
greater momentum to make broad cuts in the 48000 member district 
work force 
it certainly underscores the need to clean out some of the 
midlevel bloat dixon says the need for streamlining for 
better accountability it is all there 
eliminating police jobs could prove unpopular on capitol hill 
where lawmakers critical of city anticrime efforts are nonetheless 
anxious to see dixon take over from barry 
other pressing problems have so far defied solution among them 
the citys 1989 infant mortality rate of 231 per 1000 live births 
was higher than the rate in malaysia mauritius and uruguay 
and even before dixon can take office the sniping has begun 
dixon promises to hit the ground running but so far has 
failed to name any key lieutenants current and former city 
officials assisting her transition are complaining that the passage 
is marked by a lack of direction from dixon herself and her failure 
to list any top priorities for her new administration 
to make matters worse dixon is already dealing with government 
infighting city council chairman john wilson has made no secret of 
his desire to wield more power an advisory group he assembled to 
help him restructure his new job resembles in the words of wamufm 
political commentator mark plotkin a 1994 mayoral exploratory 
committee

federal workers everywhere from vice 
president dan quayle to the troops in the persian gulf to the 
groundskeepers at the white house will pocket fatter paychecks in 
the new year 
theres one exception to the rule president bush 
his salary stays frozen at 200000 right where it has been for 
the last 22 years and five presidencies 
for several million rankandfile workers both military and 
civilian the pay raise is a flat 41 percent 
but thousands of top federal executives are getting big raises 
on the scale of 20000 to 30000 thanks to a 1989 law that 
lifted the lid on salaries 
quayles pay will rocket from 124000 to 160600 chief 
justice william rehnquist and speaker thomas foley get the same 29 
percent increase cabinet salaries swell from 107300 to 138900 
the constitution precludes raising or lowering the 
presidents pay during his term so bush has no immediate prospects 
for a salary hike 
bush has no complaints says white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater 
he thinks his pay is adequate the presidencys still a pretty 
good job quipped the press secretary 
no one disputes that but a blueribbon panel that reviewed 
government salaries two years ago did recommend boosting the 
presidents salary in 1993 to 350000 plus a costofliving 
adjustment congress ignored the recommendation 
consumer advocate ralph nader begs to differ 
nader who lobbied strenuously to block the pay hikes believes 
bush should revoke the 1991 raises and cut his own pay as a 
gesture to the american people at a time of considerable sacrifice 
for them 
at a time of deficit and recession he should set an 
example nader said 
presidents have only gotten four pay increases in history 
experts agree that whatever the salary the presidency is rich 
in perquisites from a mansion staffed with servants to the 
limousines helicopters and boeing 747 jumbo jet at his beck and 
call 
the president probably gets the equivalent of another 500000 
in perks said lawyer lloyd n cutler who chaired the 1989 
quadrennial pay commission the perks make up for an awful lot of 
salary 
still cutler said the presidents salary is way below what it 
ought to be 
if bush were paid commensurate to corporate chiefs and top 
lawyers i suppose youd be over 1 million said cutler 
with present budget constraints this president would never ask 
for a raise if he were going to run again 
the 200000 was a darn good salary back in 1969 said fred 
hohlweg a pay expert with the office of personnel management 
hes doing worse and worse 
the consumer price index has increased nearly fourfold since 
1969 if the presidents pay had kept pace bush would be drawing 
730000 a year put another way 200000 today barely buys what 
55000 did back in 1969 
walton r winder a vice president of towers perrin co in new 
york said the chief executives of the nations 100 largest 
corporations averaged 13 million in cash compensation last year 
more than five times their 1969 level 
even top university and nonprofit organization jobs pay more 
than the presidency winder said 
vice presidents on the other hand have never had it so good 
when the first congress fixed george washingtons salary at the 
then kingly sum of 25000 in 1789 the lawmakers allotted 5000 
for vice president john adams 20 percent of the presidents 
salary 
when bush became vice president he was earning less than 40 
percent of ronald reagans salary 
but by the time bush turned the job over to dan quayle it paid 
115000 quayle got a 9000 raise earlier this year and starting 
jan 1 he will be earning barely 20 percent less than bush 
perhaps because the vice presidents salary traditionally is 
linked to that paid the speaker of the house congress has shown 
less reluctance to vote raises for the presidents standby than 
the president himself vice presidential salaries have been raised 
18 times and cut on four occasions in the depression and in 1874 
the first 17 presidents got the same 25000 salary that 
washington commanded 
ulysses s grant the 18th president got a 25000 raise that 
doubled the salary to 50000 in 1873 for his second term 
in 1909 congress forked over another 25000 boosting the 
salary to 75000 when william howard taft took office as the 27th 
president there it remained for the next 40 years 
in 1930 when babe ruth signed a stratospheric 80000ayear 
contract with the new york yankees scribes asked the slugger if he 
thought he should be paid more than president herbert hoover 
why not i had a better year than he did the babe replied 
harry truman the 33rd president became the first 
100000ayear president in 1949 dwight d eisenhower john f 
kennedy and lyndon b johnson got by on the same amount but the 
salary doubled to 200000 in 1969 when richard m nixon took the 
oath of office 
congress did that without any byyourleave from either the 
outgoing or the incoming president and it was done in a matter of 
days said sharon s gressle who tracks government salaries for 
the congressional research service 
quayle members of congress judges and others at the top of the 
salary pyramid now are eligible for costofliving increases up to 
5 percent a year 
if they got the maximum increase for the next five years then 
on jan 1 1996 the vice president would be making 205000 or 
5000 more than the president gressle said

tis the night before christmas and all 
through the house and senate lots of creatures are stirring 
especially mice 
the capitol is a building alive 
although the exact number is a national secret or it would be 
if it could be determined there is a battalion of mice living in 
the historic structure 
occasionally they make themselves known including memorable 
sightings on the house floor and in speaker thomas foleys old 
office perhaps when no one is around but the guards they frolic 
openly 
but beyond the squeaks of its diminutive yearround residents 
the capitol itself speaks 
sometimes it speaks of fear 
metal detectors and xray machines erected at nearly every 
entrance tell of a decade of increasing unease about terrorism 
hidden cameras watch the corridors 
a careful observer can rap steel inserts in the seatbacks of the 
house chamber and find a patch in the republican leaders desk 
where a bullet from a puerto rican nationalists gun penetrated 
four decades ago 
on the senate side a beefedup wall stands behind the ohio 
clock which was restored after a 1983 bomb explosion shattered its 
delicate wooden housing 
sometimes it speaks of vanity 
for example lawmakers since world war ii have taken to naming 
the rooms after themselves 
historical greats such as daniel webster and henry clay command 
no territory beyond their statues but speaker foley holds meetings 
in the thomas p oneill room named after the massachusetts 
democrat and former speaker 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine works in a 
suite named after his predecessor sen robert c byrd dwva and 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan labors in the howard baker 
rooms named for his predecessor 
the rush for recognition in the senate has so gobbled up real 
estate that some worry there may soon be no good rooms left to 
name already a christmas eve visitor would find telephone booths 
in the democratic cloakroom named for senior senators 
not only the elected officials have egos architect of the 
capitol george white had his portrait added to the collection 
painted on the arched ceilings in the house wing 
the building on the hill also speaks of power 
a sign on the door tells visitors that the house document room 
is no longer adjacent to beautiful statuary hall the repository of 
bills and reports has been moved out of the building so that 
speaker foley can add to his everexpanding kingdom 
nameplates on doors throughout the building indicate the offices 
of the most powerful and senior chairman names like rostenkowski 
whitten and byrd 
doors with no names also tell tales to those who know many are 
senators hideaways private retreats only steps from the senate 
floor where lawmakers can work undisturbed hold secret meetings or 
just catch a nap during a late session 
all around the building speaks of age and decay 
scaffolds abound during the congressional recess as expert 
plasterers and painters repair the wounds time and nature have 
inflicted on the structure 
and at the top of the dome the statue freedom is crying for its 
upcoming restoration after a century of rain wind and lightning 
and the capitol speaks of hope both whimsical and not 
the shoes of the statue of will rogers shine from people 
touching them for luck i do it more in election years says 
rep mike snyder dokla 
nearby in the rotunda among the grandiose paintings and 
statuary is a plain black and white flag with a symbol of a 
captive soldier and the letters powmia 
it always speaks its just easier to hear during the holidays

richard kimball envisions a future in which 
voters reject television campaign commercials and select national 
leaders as they would prospective employees by reviewing their 
resumes 
he has taken a leave from his job to try to make those resumes 
and more available to voters by telephone in 1992 on every 
candidate running for national office from every state 
the people in congress are the hired help said kimball 
were saying if you the voter are the employer what do you 
need to know 
kimball a political science teacher and former arizona state 
senator is directing the center for national independence in 
politics a nonprofit organization whose honorary cochairmen are 
former presidents gerald ford and jimmy carter 
kimball says that by 1992 the center will offer a telephone 
number providing voters 
basic personal information on each candidate 
names of people and organizations who have contributed to the 
campaign 
ratings of the candidate by special interest groups ranging 
from the american conservative union to the american civil 
liberties union 
kimball worked briefly many years ago in the washington offices 
of sen patrick moynihan dny and rep morris udall dariz 
after serving in the arizona senate for four years and as 
chairman of the arizona corporation commission which regulates 
utilities kimball ran for the us senate in 1986 but lost to 
sen john mccain a republican 
melodee jackson arizona democratic party executive director 
said some people questioned kimballs decision to run a longshot 
campaign against mccain when he had a secure and successful career 
with the regulatory commission 
he probably would have been reelected to the commission for 
as long as he wanted to run she said 
kimball is passionate about politics and unconventional in that 
he doesnt hold up his finger to see which way the wind is 
blowing before he takes a position jackson said 
kimball said his senate race against the wellfinanced mccain 
campaign showed him the importance of television in modern 
elections but the imagemaking quality of tv commercials sickened 
him 
the ads used nowadays are disastrous in a democracy said 
kimball how can you possibly expect people to govern themselves 
if what is put before them is not a discussion of public policy 
people cannot deal with the manipulation theyre being buried 
by meaningless information 
he said campaign finance laws can be changed but voters wont 
be better off if the money available is still used to build images 
irrelevant to issues facing the country 
the idea for the telephone service came while kimball was 
talking to former sen william proxmire dwis who campaigned for 
him in 1986 and former sen barry goldwater rariz who is a 
lifelong acquaintance 
the three of them contacted other political figures to serve on 
the centers board of directors the 35member board is equally 
divided among democrats and republicans and includes others 
unaffiliated with a party 
last election the center experimented with its concept in 
nebraska and north carolina 
we got about 6000 calls said kimball since the center did 
no paid advertising the calls were generated by news stories and 
word of mouth after one press conference 
when people called the 800number they got an operator with 
access to a computer holding the information on each candidate 
kimball said about 50 percent of the callers wanted voting 
record ratings and 25 percent sought campaign finance information 
but operators also got calls seeking a range of biographical 
details 
kimball says the center needs at least 500000 to run a 
nationwide telephone service using tollfree numbers but he said a 
selffinancing 900number system would be used if sufficient funds 
arent raised it would cost 3 a call 
seed money for the project which operated on a budget of 
290000 last year came from 35 memberships obtained through 
direct mail solicitations and a total of about 100000 from five 
foundations carnegie deer creek foundation mary reynolds 
babcock benton foundation and arca 
the center is based in tucson ariz and staffed predominantly 
by volunteers including kimball the board members are unpaid and 
include rep jim leach riowa peggy lampl former president of 
the league of women voters kenneth adelman former head of the 
us arms control and disarmament agency 1984 democratic vice 
presidential nominee geraldine ferraro sen david boren dokla 
john echohawk head native americans rights fund former sen 
george mcgovern dsd and irene natividad former president of 
the national womens political caucus

the bush administration has banked too heavily 
on soviet president mikhail gorbachevs ability to reform his 
troubled nation according to a key senate leader and others 
gorbachev is of course an historic figure effected change 
in the world more than any other person in recent years senate 
majority leader george j mitchell dmaine said sunday 
but mitchell said gorbachev is not going to rule forever in a 
country where he said the central government appears to be 
leaning towards a crackdown on the rebellious republics 
i think we should be supportive we certainly should be 
grateful for all he has done but i think our policy ought not to 
be as highly personal as it has been he said on nbctvs meet 
the press 
of the situation in the soviet union mitchell said i think 
the signs coming out of there are ominous in the last few days and 
the possibilities of that a crackdown occurring i think are 
increasing 
if a crackdown occurs he said the united states should cut off 
any aid to the soviet union 
i think we ought to have substantial aid unless and until the 
crackdown occurs and if it does then we surely should not be 
providing aid at that time he said 
zbigniew brzezinski national security adviser under former 
president carter agreed with mitchells pessimistic assessment of 
the future of the soviet union at least in the near term 
i think the coalition is beginning to break up he said 
the options are becoming more extreme and i am afraid there is 
indeed a drift toward the hard line with the kgb and the army now 
being the dominant political institutions he said 
moreover the united states has overly identified the future 
of the soviet union with gorbachev he said 
while gorbachev deserves the administrations support and 
admiration he has proved intransigent in his opposition to 
collective ownership of land and has said he will never give up on 
the idea of a multinational state run by the russians brzezinski 
said 
these two things are no longer viable he said 
earlier this month president bush outlined a varied economic 
aid package that included technical and medical assistance and 
support for the soviets to affiliate with the international 
monetary fund and the world bank 
bush announced his plan before eduard shevardnadze resigned as 
foreign minister contending the soviet union was moving towards a 
dictatorship on saturday the head of the kgb vladimir kryuchkov 
warned of a possibility of bloodshed to restore order to the 
rebellious republics 
bush has said the united states is concerned about 
shevardnadzes resignation obviously people are wondering 
about the concerns raised by mr shevardnadze he said life 
goes on he added 
former secretary of state george shultz appearing on abctvs 
this week with david brinkley said he had a hard time 
speculating what would happen in the soviet union 
for the moment he said the bush administration continue to 
engage the soviet union on key points such as reducing nuclear 
arms and trying to dampen regional conflicts

every soldier in the us armys 
1st cavalry division is getting a gift package for christmas even 
if its only a pair of governmentissue green socks 
services to mark the birth of jesus and secular yuletide symbols 
such as christmas trees are being hidden behind closed tent flaps 
so as not to offend the moslem hosts of the desert shield 
deployment 
carols are sung in combat boots and christmas spirit is as hard 
to find as reindeer in a camel herd so troops fight to keep their 
minds off the thousands of miles separating them from loved ones 
if i start thinking about it i get lonely said army spec 
robert dennett 29 of rutherford texas whose three kids will be 
opening christmas gifts without him my wife said she was going 
to save a bunch of presents til i got back and do christmas all 
over again 
christmas was intentionally subdued in saudi arabia where 
strict islamic codes ban the worship of other religions that means 
songs like white christmas are preferred over silent night 
on the military radio stations 
the only celebrity to visit is bob hope the warhorse 
troubadour who first entertained us combat troops 50 years ago 
meals and mail provided some christmas cheer 
military cooks prepared 150000 pounds of rolled turkey and 
4000 whole turkeys for the 280000 us service members brought to 
saudi arabia after iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 the goal is

their favorite holiday tunes the marine version of jingle 
bells went like this 
dashing through the sand with an m16 in hand terrorizing the 
land looking for hussein treads on tracks will ring giving 
troops a fright opens up the door we get out and fight

if people living in small towns and on small 
farms are to be helped a first step must be the formation of a 
national policy on rural development a presidential panel has 
concluded 
the national commission on agriculture and rural development 
policy said in a report sent to president bush that the 1980s 
were much harder on many rural areas than on their urban 
counterparts 
it cited economic crises in the agricultural and energy sectors 
along with tough new foreign competition in manufacturing and 
the relative disadvantage rural people have in obtaining adequate 
affordable health care education and other vital services 
another factor noted by the report is the physical and social 
isolation that separate rural america from the economic activity 
of city life 
the 15member commission was appointed for two years by 
president reagan it was authorized by the 1985 farm law which is 
now expiring 
in its first report a year ago the commission examined 
agricultural policy issues and called for a more flexible 
marketoriented farm policy that would leave it up to farmers to 
decide what crops to plant but still provide a safety net for 
hard times 
the 1990 farm law which runs for five years after the current 
one expires provided some of that flexibility in its commodity 
programs 
in its final report the commission focused on rural development 
and some of the things local people and their governments ought to 
be doing and thinking about 
no massive federal aid package was called for rather the 
commission felt there are many problems in rural america and 
rural americans are dealing with them for their fate is in their 
own hands 
still it said the federal government has a critical support 
role to play through many channels including the use of existing 
programs to help people and communities financially 
when and if a rural development policy is formulated it will 
be done in a different context from that of the past the report 
said there is currently no defined rural development policy 
instead there exists a loose collection of individual programs 
those partly resulted the report said from the division among 
various federal agencies and among the federal state and local 
governments as to who had the responsibility for rural development 
the federal government no longer plays the lead role nor do 
we expect it to the commission reported 
as many others have noted in recent years the report made it 
clear again that the problems of rural america are not homogeneous 
nor should they be solely equated with agriculture 
farming is still a vital part of the rural economy the 
report said however it directly employs less than 10 percent of 
the rural work force mining manufacturing tourism services and 
government are also important industries in the rural economy 
thus the report added neither farm policy nor any other 
singleissue policy can sufficiently address the needs of rural 
america 
the commission said the first step toward helping rural 
america is to articulate the goals for rural development policy 
which it said are not solely economic in nature 
three principles were listed by the commission as guides for 
rural development 
rural areas and people must be economically selfreliant in a 
highly competitive marketoriented world economy selfreliance is 
critical if the rural economy is to generate better jobs and income 
for its residents 
rural areas and people must be able to adapt the world economy 
has changed rapidly in recent years economic change is predicted 
to become even more rapid as a result rural areas must develop 
the ability to respond rapidly and effectively to changing market 
conditions 
the rural physical and cultural environment should be 
protected the physical environment in rural areas and the cultural 
heritage of rural people are valuable elements of national life and 
livelihood enjoyed by rural and urban residents alike and deserve 
protection

doctors who visited kurdish refugees in late 
1988 say their interviews and examinations convinced them iraqi 
president saddam hussein had used chemical weapons against his own 
people 
the physicians vociferously disputed a us military study in 
which the authors said there was no conclusive evidence that iraq 
gassed the kurds in august and september 1988 
we disagree very strongly dr howard hu said of the 
conclusions reached by the military analysts who wrote a book 
entitled iraqi power and us security in the middle east the 
book is primarily about the iraqiran war which ended in july 
1988 
hu who works at harvard medical school said in a telephone 
interview from boston last week that he and two other doctors 
traveled to turkey in october 1988 to interview kurds who had fled 
iraq after the alleged gas attacks 
was there any doubt that the kurds had been gassed no hu 
said the doctors are associated with physicians for human rights 
a bostonbased group 
they conducted indepth videotaped interviews examined alleged 
victims and administered a 14page questionnaire 
they saw people who had skin burns that are characteristic of 
chemical weapons burns hu said moreover the reports from the 
refugees were consistent 
according to the testimony the refugees saw bombing runs by 
lowflying jets followed by the appearance of dark yellow clouds 
the sudden death of animals and humans and they experienced skin 
blistering and severe irritation of the respiratory passages 
hu said the physicians did not see victims until nearly six 
weeks after the attacks however 
the team could not determine the number of weapons used the 
scale of the attacks or the exact chemical composition of the 
chemical agents the doctors said 
president bush and others have used iraqs alleged use of 
chemical weapons against the kurds as one of the justifications 
stopping saddams aggression in the persian gulf 
weve seen him use chemical weapons on his own people bush 
said 
but three analysts at the us army war college whose book was 
released last summer raise questions about whether saddam gassed 
the kurds in the fall of 1988 
having looked at all of the evidence that was available to us 
we find it impossible to confirm the state departments claim that 
gas was used in this instance the authors wrote 
to begin with there were never any victims produced they 
said the authors said the claims rest solely on the testimony of 
refugees 
the military authors did not visit iraq but looked at the 
available reports they speculated the kurds might have been 
injured by fuel air explosives instead of chemical weapons 
iraq denied at the time that it had gassed the kurds and turkish 
officials said they too found no evidence of chemical weapons 
injuries among the 60000 kurdish refugees 
the authors said the conclusions in their book were their own 
and did not necessarily reflect the views of the us military

after 168 years clement moores holiday poem 
the night before christmas is solid as gold 
but another of his creations stately st peters episcopal 
church for which he donated the land and design is falling 
apart 
the churchs patched sagging roof probably couldnt support a 
sleigh let alone eight tiny reindeer and its back wall bulges 
like santas belly 
theres a nice pile of stones out in the garden and theyve 
all fallen out of the tower said ronald kastner who heads a 
campaign to raise 3 million to repair the new york city landmark 
the churchs 130foot bell tower is held together by steel 
cables and masked by scaffolding the towers fourfaced clock is 
still and many of its stones have fallen and damaged the roof of 
the nave windows that once boasted tiffanystyle stained glass are 
boarded up 
if we dont get the money kastner said the tower will 
fall onto the roof and the roof will collapse and the church will 
close 
the episcopal diocese of new york gave the congregation 500000 
for repairs but st peters must raise the needed 3 million more 
tself 
the church is just one of clement clarke moores many 
accomplishments born in 1779 he grew up on what was then his 
familys rural estate the area is now part of manhattans bustling 
chelsea neighborhood 
in 1817 moore donated the church property for the general 
theological seminary where he was a distinguished biblical scholar 
for three decades but he is remembered for an account of a visit 
from st nicholas also known as the night before christmas 
he is said to have written the poem during a sleigh ride home 
from greenwich village just before christmas 1822 and to have read 
it later to his six children the piece was published a year later 
in the troy sentinel and helped create st nicks image as a 
jolly old elf who looked more like a peddler than a childrens 
saint 
but even as moores composition was rising to fame its pastoral 
setting was disappearing in the 1820s chelsea was a 
twostagecoach trip from what was then the city and is now lower 
manhattan but urbanites were moving steadily north to escape 
disease and congestion 
around 1830 moore decided to develop his farm called chelsea 
as a planned residential suburb he sold the land in lots but 
attached restrictions no alleys stables or factories and no 
building within 10 feet of the sidewalk moore the developer 
transformed the landscape 
moore the poet said historian stephen nissenbaum helped 
transform the nations most widely observed holiday from a big 
public occasion of rowdiness that lasted a month into a domestic 
and private event within the family 
st peters with its tower and massively buttressed fieldstone 
walls became a focal point of the new neighborhood upon its 
completion in 1838 moore persuaded the congregation to accept a 
neogothic design inspired by his visits to english churches 
by 1900 st peters had about 500 parishioners but membership 
fell off as the building declined it was closed temporarily in 
1941 because of leaks in the roof 
over the years water continued to seep into the building 
loosening the mortar that held its stones and weakening the roofs 
wooden framing 
when the rev wray mackay took over as vicar the church 
averaged 10 people at sunday services but mackay expanded the 
congregation by increasing its services including an aids 
ministry a food pantry a program for the areas welfare hotel 
residents and seasonal clothing drives the church now has about 
200 members 
moore died in 1863 and is buried 130 blocks uptown at trinity 
cemetery there every christmas eve carolers gather to sing the 
praises of the citys most illustrious theologian poet developer 
and architect

as the united nations takes a stronger 
role in world affairs hopes are rising that the general assembly 
will become more efficient 
the assembly which ended its fall session last week is to many 
minds long overdue for reform 
un officials say the sessions are too short that delegations 
are dealing with too much nonessential business and a crush of 
unnecessary paperwork 
though the 15nation security council gets most of the limelight 
at times of international crisis the assembly which includes all 
159 member states handles much of the organizations business 
timing is one important area 
the timing of the un general assembly sessions was 
originally determined with an eye to sailing schedules of the queen 
mary says the undersecretarygeneral for general assembly 
affairs ronald spiers it is now anachronistic 
the assembly still ends its fall meeting at the same time it did 
at the united nations founding in 1945 
what kind of general assembly is this which works for three 
months and hibernates during the remaining nine months asks 
guido de marco maltas foreign minister who is president of the 
assembly this year 
spiers the top american in the world body says in a working 
paper that the assembly needs to be viewed as a yearround body 
not in continuous meeting but always available at call not 
constrained by outofdate considerations 
de marco says it should expand its calendar of meetings to focus 
on foreign affairs in the septemberdecember session and add 
assemblies on humanitarian affairs in march and an economic and 
social session in may and june 
spiers advocates a general debate in november with assembly 
committees churning out the work of the body from january until the 
following autumn 
de marco says thriceyearly assemblies would enable the general 
assembly to focus its work on specific themes attracting 
likeminded government ministers concerned with those areas 
this would pave the way for advances in social economic and 
humanitarian areas like the breakthroughs announced every fall in 
the political sphere when foreign ministers congregate in new york 
every september 
among the resolutions remaining on the current agenda are 
retreads of antiapartheid declarations redundant antiisrael 
measures the report on the drinking water supply and sanitation 
decade and measures to be taken against nazi fascist and 
neofascist activities 
spiers says that rather than carry over items from year to year 
they should die out and be approached anew each session 
each year the whole assembly is obligated to devoting time to 
such matters as appointment of new members of the economic and 
social council auditors reports on un activities and a host of 
other issues that could be disposed of at the subcommittee level 
or simply shelved 
we dont need so many resolutions said de marco we need 
fewer stronger much more topical and much more effective 
resolutions 
spiers and de marco have been discussing their ideas separately 
with committee chairman un officials and ambassadors 
ive been finding very positive reaction among the 
delegations de marco said 
wherever you meet delegations you find that they are all 
discussing this matter he said

the yuletide holiday is such a big deal at west 
high school that even the campus christmas tree bursts into song 
students at the school normally provide the voices for their 
singing christmas tree but this year in honor of a halfcentury 
of song alumni from the classes of 1940 to 1989 joined in at two 
weekend concerts 
mothers and fathers who memorized the verses to silent night 
and what child is this decades ago have been practicing for 
the reprise since october some alongside their daughters sons 
nieces and nephews 
alumni representing every year of the trees last 49 climbed the 
risers on the 24foot trees steel framework to stand between the 
branches and give the audience what looks like a christmas tree 
come to life 
nearly 200 alumni came back for the golden anniversary the 
first singing christmas tree reunion since 1982 the schools 
centennial year 
two former west high music directors james fluckey and john 
thorin interrupted their retirements to help coordinate the 
event 
the tradition that has drawn them together this holiday season 
started when west high teacher willa girault saw a singing 
christmas tree in jackson miss at her suggestion it began in 
1940 with 46 singers standing on wooden planks and holding tree 
branches 
its our claim to fame said fluckey who as music director 
from 1955 to 1983 was in charge when the tree was flown to 
washington dc for a 1972 performance in front of the white 
house 
every year wed get people whod come and say theyd been to 
the last 20 concerts and would never miss it said thorin who 
was at west high from 1970 to 1988 
that tradition helped instill a lifelong love of music in denver 
resident bill keith one of those back for the reunion 
i think it all started here said keith who was part of the 
singing christmas tree from 1943 to 1946 
he attended the juilliard school of music on a scholarship after 
graduation from west high and went on to teach music to high school 
and college students 
he was chosen by a panel of offcampus judges to be one of this 
years soloists standing as a star near the top of the tree to 
sing silent night 
in the old days the student body voted to pick the trees stars 
and everybody wanted to be one said dale lechuga of greeley one 
of the stars in the late 1960s 
there was nothing like it she said 
but there were pitfalls to standing near the top so close to 
the stage lights said janet kitzman who recalled that people 
sometimes passed out up there kitzman who graduated in 1952 is 
singing with her son and two daughters this year 
after 50 years school officials acknowledge that enthusiasm for 
the singing christmas tree had dwindled in recent years 
west high vocalmusic diredtor stephen nye had commemorative 
buttons and sweatshirts made up for 1990 to try to rekindle the old 
spirit 
some of the glow had become tarnished he said so were 
trying to renew interest in it

one hundred years after a pharmacist mixed 
the first batch of magic croup salve later renamed vicks vaporub 
mothers are still tucking sick children into bed with a smear of 
the gooey aromatic concoction one of americas most enduring cold 
remedies vicks vaporub still comes in the same distinctive blue 
jar and still unclogs millions of stuffed noses with its 
unmistakable vapors 
it is little changed from the mix of menthol camphor and 
eucalyptus oil in a petrolatum base that lunsford richardson 
created at his greensboro nc pharmacy in 1890 
people under the weather with colds or the flu smear the 
vaporizing salve on their chests or throats or dab it under their 
noses for congestion relief generations of children recall it as 
their mothers favorite cureall 
in the early days the richardson family used coffee pots to 
pour warm salve from large kettles into small jars vaporub 
salesmen in a fleet of ford model ts traveled the countryside 
searching for customers tacking advertisements high up on barns 
and trees with ladders provided for the job 
today vicks vaporub is sold in more than 100 countries and is 
made at more than a dozen plants around the world from its 
birthplace in north carolina to factories in mexico india and 
australia 
more than 1 million gallons of vaporub are sold worldwide each 
year according to its maker richardsonvicks inc nearly 4 out of 
5 americans have used the product at one time and if every 
container ever sold in the united states were laid side to side 
they could circle the globe twice 
but as vaporub enters its 100th year of fighting colds 
richardsonvicks is trying to stem a long sales decline by touting 
it as something more than an oldfashioned remedy 
us sales of vaporub began falling off in the late 1960s as 
consumers began turning to new overthecounter cold remedies once 
available only by prescription said debra bennetts spokeswoman 
for richardsonvicks at its connecticut headquarters 
in 1967 richardsonvicks introduced nyquil a nighttime cold 
medicine that is now the companys top seller 
vaporub sales kept falling in the 1980s dropping by nearly 10 
percent in 198788 to a level maintained for the next two years 
bennetts said 
the company acquired by the proctor amp gamble co in 1985 would 
not provide actual sales figures but sales appear to be better 
this year thanks to an ad campaign aimed at older people unable to 
take oral decongestants and cough remedies because they take 
medication for heart disease or high blood pressure 
who cares if youve got high blood pressure and catch a 
cold the ad reads we care 
vaporubs early success was due as much to the marketing skills 
of richardsons son smith richardson as to its formula 
the elder lunsford richardson formed the vick family remedies 
co in 1905 to manufacture and sell his line of 21 home remedies 
but his son convinced him to concentrate solely on the original 
product he renamed the salve vaporub to dramatize its aromatic 
characteristics 
sales reached 50000 a year by 1910 the compny could afford 
to buy a fleet of model t fords for its salesmen who used ladders 
provided by the firm to tack signs on barns and trees an early 
form of billboard advertising 
heading north richardson used a different marketing strategy 
newspaper ads resembling news articles that were accompanied by 
coupons for free vaporub salve 
the ads did not make any outrageous claims like those for many 
medical remedies of the day the epidemic of spanish influenza near 
the end of world war i led to a nearly fivefold increase in sales 
in three years 
the company began expanding into foreign markets in the 1920s 
and by the end of the decade was selling vaporub in 60 nations it 
began to diversify in the 1930s when it introduced its cough and 
nose drops

the alarm first sounded three years ago 
when one of brandeis universitys dining halls started serving pork 
and shellfish 
now the departure of the schools president has heightened 
debate over the schools jewish identity 
one jewish scholar argues that the changes made by president 
evelyn handler symbolized something not only about the school but 
about choices jews have to make in american society 
brandeis university has been struggling with what could be 
seen in a complex way as this temptation to assimilate gordon 
fellman an associate professor of sociology wrote in the 
novemberdecember edition of tikkun a liberal jewish publication 
based in oakland calif 
founded in 1948 the year israel became a state brandeis was 
named after justice louis d brandeis the first jew on the us 
supreme court the schools jewish founders wanted it to be 
nonsectarian like harvard and notre dame 
the school today has an enrollment of 3600 and an endowment of 
150 million in recent years the student body was estimated to be 
65 percent jewish a school spokesman said he didnt know what that 
percentage is now 
handler became the universitys fifth president in 1983 and 
encountered criticism in 1987 over changes in the dining hall and 
the schools logo 
the menu change officially was billed as internationalizing the 
cuisine fellman said brandeis had always maintained one dining 
hall for kosher students and another hall for others but while the 
nonkosher hall would serve milk with meat violating strict jewish 
dietary laws it did not serve meat considered impure in the jewish 
tradition until 1987 
at about the same time brandeis removed the hebrew word for 
truth from the schools logo fellman said and the university 
calendar dropped references to jewish holidays 
amid a campus outcry the logo and holiday references have been 
restored 
handler announced in june that she would resign at the end of 
this school year shes now on sabbatical 
she has refused to discuss her decision to step down im not 
prepared to talk to you over the telephone or any other place 
she said when asked for an interview 
david rosen a university spokesman said members of the 
brandeis community blew changes in the dining hall and the school 
logo out of proportion 
i think its grossly unfair to suggest that she was trying to 
disavow that jewish heritage but the controversy was cast in 
those terms by some people he said 
these are all very terrible misunderstandings they were all 
just a bum rap 
he said handler stressed the schools nonsectarian philosophy 
and was seen as attempting to attract students from more diverse 
backgrounds 
she also tried to attract more donors to the school which 
largely relies on the american jewish community this year the 
school has had to institute a hiring freeze and cuts in spending to 
make up a 3 million budget gap 
the philosophy of the university has changed under the interim 
president as it conducts a search for handlers replacement rosen 
said 
i think the current interim president stuart altman while 
reaffirming the interest in diversity has also felt a need to be 
more open and forthcoming about the jewish heritage than dr 
handler did he said 
fellman said the debate may be healthy for the school i think 
part of what handler did inadvertently was to surface the issue of 
jewishness among many of us he said

when the materialistic side of christmas rears 
its ugly head child psychologists admit it often has a childs 
face 
never mind visions of sugar plums for many children the only 
things dancing in their heads with all the resolution of a 
nintendo or turbografx16 home video game are dreams of teenage 
mutant ninja turtles batman and gogo my walking pup 
experts on child development call it a natural process for 
youngsters to want things at around age 2 they say the average 
child says mine about everything in view its only over time 
that they develop a sense of what is theirs and what belongs to 
others 
to learn how to give they first have to learn what it feels 
like to be recipients of love or gifts or whatever so you could 
consider it a developmental process said caroline persell head 
of the sociology department at new york university 
if its sort of a stage that people have to go through 
hopefully they get beyond it when they see some of the fun of 
thinking of gifts for other people thats part of the fun of 
christmas 
but dont most children think tis better to receive than to 
give 
i think kids from a very young age are capable of being 
totally selfish said martin hoffman head of the nyu psychology 
department but they are also capable of being quite empathic and 
sympathetic toward others who do not have what they have 
the problem hoffman said is not that children are inherently 
selfish but that christmas thrusts them into a context that 
surrounds them with all sorts of neat things they would like to 
have and they usually respond with according materialism even 
greed 
but change the context and the same child might offer a 
pleasant surprise 
most kids as greedy and self oriented as they appear when 
they go to visit santa in the department stores and sit on his lap 
and ask for everything under the sun if put into the position of 
knowing that there are other children who have nothing and if 
there are adults around who make the suggestion that they might 
want to share some of their things most kids would share a lot 
hoffman said 
hoffman explained that children and parents too are bombarded 
by television commercials that put them in the context of gift 
getters rarely as potential givers but it neednt be that way 
hoffman asserts 
in that sense hoffman said children reflect american society 
as a whole 
this whole american culture is probably the most materialistic 
culture in the history of humankind on the other hand it is also a 
very giving culture

serious condition in the accident sunday about 50 miles south of 
aldhafra airbase in abu dhabi 
the sailors were on shore leave taking an offroad tour in an 
allterrain bus when the accident occurred the military said the 
statement said the cause of the accident was under investigation

businesses will have up to four years 
instead of two to provide safer equipment and working conditions 
for video display terminal users under a compromise mayor art 
agnos has agreed to sign his aides say 
what was hailed as the nations toughest vdt law won final 
approval last week from the city board of supervisors but agnos 
wouldnt commit to signing it until he talked to business and labor 
groups about its impact and cost 
after a weekend meeting with agnos the two sides agreed 
saturday to several amendments one extending the compliance period 
from two years to as many as four years the mayors aides said 
the compromise which agnos plans to sign thursday must go back 
to the supervisors for approval 
this is an example of what happens when both sides come to the 
table and we now have something that both sides can live with 
said claude everhart deputy mayor for government operations who 
mediated the negotiations 
the compromise measure still calls for frequent work breaks 
proper lighting antiglare screens adjustable computer furniture 
and equipment to make vdt use safer 
among the problems associated with regular work at a computer 
keyboard are nerve damage to the wrists and fingers back and neck 
strain eye strain sleep disturbances chronic headaches nausea 
and fatigue 
labor leaders hope the vdt law will be a model for other cities 
and counties in california and for the state and other states 
nationwide 
business groups have consistently opposed efforts to pass such 
legislation because of its expense and because some doubt vdt use 
causes health problems 
city budget analysts estimate businesses will spend as much as 
765 million and the city as much as 6 million to comply with the 
law 
the board on dec 17 passed the ordinance on a 74 vote just 
short of the eight votes needed to override an agnos veto 
at saturdays eighthour meeting business and labor leaders 
agreed to implement the law in three stages 
first any new equipment purchased one year or more after the 
law is adopted must conform to the new standards 
within 30 months businesses must bring most workstations into 
conformance with vdt safety standards 
if doing so costs more than 250 those businesses will have an 
additional 18 months to comply 
the law applies to companies with 15 or more employees it also 
creates an advisory panel to monitor research about possible 
radiation hazards and other heath effects from vdt use

scientists have discovered harmless bacteria 
that can remove radioactive contaminants from waste water a report 
published today said 
the process does not resolve the problem of nuclearwaste 
disposalthe research team from the oak ridge national laboratory 
in tennessee cautioned 
but the microbioal scrubbing of waste water does offer a 
natural way to remove harmful metals and radioactive contaminants 
in water that drains from facilities like radiology rooms nuclear 
power plants and atomic weapons factories team scientists dr 
brendlyn d faison told the baltimore sun 
the finding may lead to the biological filtration of waterborne 
nuclear waste that would be cheaper and more effective than 
chemical methods now in use faison said 
in the case of widespread contamination of a water supply as 
occurred at chernobyl biological treatment may be a highly 
costeffective environmentally acceptable approach to site 
restoration she told the newspaper 
the process differs from biological treatment of oil spills in 
that the pollutants are not rendered harmless instead the 
bacteria bind with the particles similar to magnets attracting 
iron fillings 
the bacteria become covered with radioactive particles and then 
are filtered from the water to form a radioactive sediment that can 
be more easily disposed of than if they had still been in solution 
faison said 
so far the government laboratory has completed tests with only 
one bacterium micrococcus luteus that can bind with strontium 
a metal commonly found in radioactive form in nuclear industry 
waste water 
the process is almost instantaneous and can reduce strontium 
concentrations in water to almost immeasurable partperbillion 
levels faison said 
the oak ridge research team is investigating other biological 
methods of filtering radioactive metals faison said that one of 
the more promising findings so far is a common alga that seems able 
to efficiently remove cesium another harmful metal 
diane darrigo spokeswoman for the antinuclear nuclear 
information and resource service said the oak ridge findings were 
interesting but the question is still what do you do with the 
radioactive microbes 
i hope this type of technology doesnt lead to the misguided 
assumption that its ok to contaminate water simply because it can 
be cleared up more easily she said

with voters in westwardlooking 
slovenia urging secession by a nearly 9to1 margin officials 
today looked ahead to talks that may decide whether the republic 
will break away from yugoslavia 
within the next six months slovenia will decide whether to 
stay in yugoslavia or become an independent european country 
slovenian president milan kucan said 
in sundays plebiscite 882 percent voted for secession and 
thousands celebrated the results in the slovenian capital of 
ljubljana by dancing in the streets and uncorking champagne 
four percent voted against secession and the remainder of the 
ballots were invalid according to final unofficial results 
provided by political parties 
in the spring slovenia and croatia ousted communists in 
landmark multiparty elections both republics have threatened to 
secede unless yugoslavia becomes a loose confederation of 
semiindependent states 
that put them on a collision course with serbia the largest and 
most powerful of the multiethnic countrys six republics and seat 
of the federal capital belgrade 
lessdeveloped serbia where authorities have been more 
resistant to westernstyle reforms advocates a strong federal 
government 
federal authorities have threatened armed intervention if any 
republic moves to secede they say all the republics must agree to 
any secession 
serbias socialists the renamed longruling communists won 
87 seats of 96 parliamentary seats filled in a first round of 
republicwide elections on dec 9 
in addition serbias president former communist slobodan 
milosevic was reelected to the states presidency with 65 percent 
of the vote 
a second round of voting was held sunday to fill the remaining 
154 seats in the serbian parliament and prominent socialist 
candidates including premier stanko radmilovic were reportedly 
upset according to unofficial results 
first official results of the vote were expected tuesday 
electoral officials said the turnout was reported at about 60 
percent 
montenegro the smallest republic also had runoff elections 
sunday but no results were available the league of communists is 
in power there 
the slovene plebiscite law sets a sixmonth transition period to 
bring armed forces customs and border authorities under slovene 
control a new constitution a separate currency and the issuing of 
slovenian passports would follow said the republics premier lojze 
peterle 
negotiations on secession could start with the republics share 
of yugoslavias 9 billion hard currency reserves and its 17 
billion foreign debt 
turnout in slovenias plebiscite was reported to be around 90 
percent of 15 million eligible voters 
this democratic decision by the slovenian people which gives 
us the right to determine our own destiny will not be to the 
detriment of any other yugoslav nation said kucan 
the central intelligence agency recently predicted that 
yugoslavia may disintegrate within 18 months and civil war could 
break out 
the yugoslav presidency last week said slovenias referendum was 
unacceptable defense minister gen veljko kadijevic has threatened 
intervention by the federal army to preserve the federation 
janez jansa slovenias minister in charge of the local 
territorial defense said his people would fight 
we will use force to defend ourselves if the yugoslav military 
attacks us he said sunday 
slovenia which neighbors austria and italy is home to 2 
million of yugoslavias 23 million people but accounts for about 
17 percent of the countrys economic output and 30 percent of its 
exports

yugoslav collective presidency said in an interview sunday that he 
met last week with milosevic for talks on the countrys future 
we have agreed that there is a need for dialogue drnovsek

frances defense minister canceled 
a meeting with his saudi counterpart after the kingdom refused to 
allow a french rock star to entertain troops in the desert a 
french embassy spokesman said today 
there was a rather clipped exchange of diplomatic notes 
said the embassy spokesman who spoke on condition of anonomity 
there was no official saudi announcement about the cancellation 
but the concert apparently would have offended the countrys strict 
moslem tenets 
since the saudis consider the whole country a mosque you 
really cannot show any western culture especially a rock or pop 
concert the embassy spokesman said 
eddy schmoll mitchell was supposed to perform his 1950sstyle 
rock n roll for soldiers stationed near the border with kuwait at 
hafr albatin where most of frances 5000man rapid action force 
is deployed 
the embassy spokesman said frances defense chief jeanpierre 
chevenement was extremely angry when the concert was not allowed 
to proceed it was intended as a morale boost during the holiday 
season 
chevenement was to have met this afternoon meeting with his 
saudi counterpart prince sultan instead he met with sultans 
son lt gen prince khalid official head of the multinational 
forces 
there has been tension in the past between the french military 
and the saudi defense ministry over press visits to the troops 
saudi officials said they were not informed of all reporters 
traveling north to visit the troops 
the predominant moslem sect in saudi arabia bans public 
entertainment such as concerts and movies 
bob hope the only entertainer to visit during the christmas 
season in keeping with his 50year tradition of troop shows was 
expected to meet with us troops today and tuesday 
out of sensitivity to the saudis no shows were officially 
planned and media coverage was to be limited

saddam hussein says tel aviv will be iraqs 
first target if war breaks out in the persian gulf a spanish 
television station that conducted a weekend interview with the 
iraqi leader said today 
saddam has threatened before to attack israel but it was the 
first time he said he would make the jewish state his first target 
such a strategy is presumably aimed at weakening the resolve of 
moderate arab members of the multinational force arrayed against 
iraq 
the private television station tele 5 broadcast brief video 
images of the saturday interview with saddam but no audio it 
plans to broadcast the entire interview on wdnesday 
the staterun news agency efe whose technicians took part in 
the twohour interview in baghdad quoted saddam as saying tel aviv 
would be iraqs first target whether or not israel joins an 
international war effort against iraq 
fearing such an attack israel has been distributing gas masks 
to all its citizens 
the united nations has authorized the use of military force 
after jan 15 if iraq does not withdraw its troops from kuwait 
the spanish tv interviewer luis marinas said saddam contended 
that the united states sent troops to the persian gulf following 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait because it wants to control the 
flow of petroleum from oil fields in the area 
the iraqi leader also said he believed that thursdays 
resignation of soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze was a 
positive sign he alleged that shevardnadze had become too 
influenced by the united states marinas said 
no further details of the interview were immediately available

an offbeat couple defied yuletide tradition 
and gravity by hanging their scotch pine ornaments lights and 
even giftwrapped boxes from the ceiling to create a topsyturvy 
christmas 
jim and judy young knew the idea was different when a tree lot 
worker shot them funny looks after they asked him to lift a tree by 
its trunk so they could see how it looked upsidedown 
then the boy looked at me and said do you drink much jim 
young said i gave him my address i told him to come up to look 
at it after we got it decorated 
the 6foot pines needles point toward the floor a twinkling 
star dangles from its inverted apex lights and ornaments are 
attached so their bottoms point toward the base of the tree as they 
would if the tree were right side up only limp silver tinsel 
icicles appear to obey the law of gravity 
cant seem to get them to go the other way young sighed 
to complete the project the youngs glued brightly wrapped 
empty gift boxes to the ceiling around the base of the tree 
it wouldnt be a tree without the presents he said

servicemen on shore leave back to the us aircraft carrier 
saratoga american officials said 
the decision was made in consultation with israeli authorities 
who felt there was no way of finding the body 
the us embassy said it was assumed the body would eventually 
wash ashore the missing man was identified as aviation 
ordinanceman 3rd class anthony j fleming 25 of buffalo ny 
ferry service to the saratoga was suspended after the only

with only a limited number of helicopters available for shuttle 
service many of the saratogas crew who had gone on shore leave 
were to spend christmas on land instead of returning to the 
carrier 
first preference for helicopter furloughs went to servicemen who 
were aboard the ferry that capsized early saturday and their 
rescuers followed by those whose wives or girlfriends flew to 
israel for the holidays a navy lieutenant said on condition of 
anonymity 
crewmen bade a tearful farewell to their 21 comrades at a 
memorial service sunday aboard the saratoga the dead were 
symbolized by rows of sailors caps and a petty officers hat laid 
out on a table 
there are no words that can express the heartfelt sorrow of 
this entire 5000man ship said the carriers skipper capt 
joseph s mobley 
among the 1200 mourners were many of the 81 survivors of the 
chartered israeli ferry tuvia which capsized and sank as it 
carried 102 saratoga crewmen back from a shore leave 
mobley told reporters that the navy concluded with utmost 
confidence that fleming had died he was definitely on the 
ferry at the time of the accident he was definitely not rescued 
he said 
nineteen bodies were recovered saturday including six pulled by 
israeli divers from the sunken twodeck ferry 
another was found sunday shortly before a military air 
transport left for dover air base in delaware with the corpses 
the plane was delayed several hours and was to arrive this 
afternoon air force lt teresa schallock said strong headwinds had 
forced the plane to divert to britain to take on more fuel 
at the memorial service in one of the saratogas huge aircraft 
hangars men wiped away tears as a choir sang america the 
beautiful and the navy hymn eternal father 
two sailors dropped a wreath into the mediterranean in honor of 
the victims and a detachment of seven marines fired a 21gun 
salute in three rifle salvos 
we have suffered a very great tragedy every man on this 
mighty ship has had his heart in his throat tears in his eyes and 
a knot in his stomach since that event mobley said 
the saratoga task force based at mayport naval air station in 
florida includes the destroyer sampson cruiser south carolina and 
combat stores ship sirius it has a crew of 6200 men 
the saratoga and its escort ships had come from the red sea 
where they joined in the naval buildup in the persian gulf 
two israeli investigations and one probe by the us navy are 
under way into the ferry sinking 
survivors said water was washing into the 57foot ferry from 
waves when it was suddenly swamped by two huge swells about 200 
yeards from the saratoga israeli officials believe too many men 
were gathered in the back of the craft

a shopping mall in hiroshima repainted a huge 
rooftop santa claus it had portrayed as a black man after black 
residents reportedly complained a professor said today 
the 18foothigh black santa had exaggeratedly fat lips 
diamondstudded rings sunglasses and sneakers 
such caricatures of blacks are common in japanese advertising 
but are becoming less popular due to criticism of racial 
stereotyping 
the santa was put up in november on a fake brick chimney above 
the sun mall in hiroshima 430 miles southwest of tokyo 
peter goldsbury a professor of philosophy at hiroshima 
university put a photo of the santa on the cover of his local 
magazine hiroshima sign post after he heard that black 
foreigners living in the city were upset by the figures 
exaggerated features 
i wanted to make people talk goldsbury said hiroshima is 
supposed to be a center of international peace culture but here 
was yet another example of undesirable cultural stereotyping 
after the nationwide newspaper asahi shimbun also drew attention 
to the black santa his face was coated with lightcolored paint 
and a white beard was added to cover his thick lips goldsbury 
said 
managers at the shopping mall were not available for comment 
today because of a national holiday 
japan has drawn harsh criticism from the united states in recent 
years for toys and books unflatteringly portraying black characters 
and for controversial racial remarks made by politicians 
in november a japanese city that is bidding for the 1998 winter 
olympics advised schools and libraries to destroy materials 
featuring the little black sambo character another stereotype 
that has drawn protests to improve the citys image 
in august a citizens group forced a major publishing house to 
strike out expressions and drawings exaggerating physical features 
of blacks in five popular comic books 
in the most recent controversial racial comments justice 
minister seiroku kajiyama in september angered minority groups when 
he compared american blacks to prostitutes who ruin the 
atmosphere of the neighborhoods they move into

defense minister moshe arens appointed a 
committee today to study possible economic development in the 
occupied gaza strip in what was seen as a first step toward 
separating the territorys economy from israels 
any encouragement of development in the occupied territories 
would be a reversal of israels policy of keeping gaza and the west 
bank dependent on israeli goods and employing palestinians as cheap 
labor in israel 
a defense ministry statement announced formation of the 
committee headed by economist ezrah sadan the statement said the 
group also will investigate the relationship between the economies 
of gaza and israel 
according to the daily haaretz a ministerial committee headed 
by prime minister yitzhak shamir recently gave the israeli military 
government in the territories a green light to push for 
establishment of an independent economic infrastructure in the 
territories 
in line with this policy the military administration has 
approved the creation of dozens of new plants and given licenses to 
factories that operated illegally without them haaretz said in a 
report published sunday 
the newspaper said this decision deviated from israels policy 
since the west bank and gaza were occupied in the 1967 middle east 
war 
haaretz described the previous policy as one designed to 
strangle the expression of independent economic initiative 
because of the policy however israel has become dependent on a 
palestinian work force of more than 100000 people most hold 
lowpaid jobs in construction restaurants and other fields 
but following a wave of stabbing attacks by arabs israelis have 
demanded the government limit the number of palestinians allowed to 
work in israel the stabbing attacks followed the oct 8 temple 
mount riot in which israeli police killed 17 palestinians 
the military government has increased to 10000 the number of 
palestinians considered a security risk and banned from entering 
israel many arabs have lost their jobs in israel following strikes 
and nationalist attacks linked to the 3yearold palestinian 
uprising against israeli occupation 
economics minister david magen said last week that he has won 
wide government backing for a plan to refuse entry to about 60000 
palestinians working in israel without a permit this would also 
reate employment for newly arrived soviet immigrants expected to 
reach in the hundreds of thousands 
haaretz noted the reason for encouraging the territories 
economy was the fear that rising palestinian unemployment coupled 
with lack of economic infrastructure could create a ticking time 
bomb in the west bank and gaza 
about 65000 gazans or half the local labor force are employed 
in israel if fired they stand little chance of finding work in 
the impoverished strip home to 750000 palestinians about 1 
million arabs live in the west bank

the main colors of 
christmas eve in bethlehem this year were purple red black and 
green the hues of the berets of hundreds of soldiers dispatched 
to provide security in the holy town 
only a few dozen tourists were seen as the roman catholic 
patriarch of jerusalem michel sabah arrived in bethlehem at 
midday to open the christmas season in the holy land 
a light drizzle fell as a procession of priests led sabah 
through manger square and into the church of the nativity built 
over the grotto where tradition holds that christ was born 
a strike called by the leadership of the palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip closed 
all shops and restaurants in bethlehem 
there were no holiday decorations as officials of this town of 
40000 canceled most celebrations in solidarity with the 3yearold 
revolt 
the tourism ministry predicted that fewer than 7000 people 
would visit bethlehem this year down from 10000 last year 
tourism in israel has been cut in half by the persian gulf 
crisis and many of the arab hotels in jerusalem that cater to 
christian pilgrims are shut because of too few guests 
bethlehems palestinian mayor elias freij issued a statement 
praying for peace on earth and goodwill toward all people and 
peace in the holy land between israelis and palestinians and peace 
amongst all the arabs 
freij however blamed the lack of tourists on a us state 
department warning for americans not to travel to the middle east 
it is the fault of the american greed to fight for the oil in 
kuwait and to disregard the human rights of all people here he 
said 
before the uprising thousands of pilgrims would gather for 
holiday festivities in bethlehem and elsewhere 
gabriele beitz a tourist from heidelberg germany was visiting 
along with her husband and 11yearold daughter and said she was 
frightened at finding the streets so empty it is a very very 
fearful situation 
we are very depressed about the place and about the whole 
political situation here she said for us christmas is an 
event of peace and here you cannot feel peace 
in manger square sabah was greeted by the israeli military 
governor of bethlehem dudu mufaz the greeting is a tradition that 
stretches back to the times when the turks and then the british 
ruled palestine 
as a christmas gesture the military announced it was releasing 
217 palestinian prisoners arrested during the uprising 
despite the lack of tourists an israelisponsored choir concert 
was going ahead but only one visiting choir from the first united 
methodist church of oklahoma city was to take part in the event 
security was especially heavy in bethlehem this year because of 
a wave arabjewish clashes following the oct 8 temple mount riot 
in which israeli police killed 17 palestinians 
thousands of israeli soldiers and police manned roadblocks and 
rooftop observation posts on roads leading to bethlehem and inside 
the town 
metal detectors were set up at the seven streets leading to 
manger square and everyone entering was searched 
army curfews were imposed on the three refugee camps in the 
area confining 15000 arabs to their homes 
last year some cars were stoned passing the camps

a conservative mentioned as a possible 
challenger to president bush in the 1992 presidential sweepstakes 
has set up a political action committee often an early step toward 
a presidential run 
but former delaware gov pete du pont told the union leader of 
manchester that the purpose of his committee for republican 
leadership is to fight taxes not launch a presidential bid 
du pont who ran for the republican nomination in 1988 said 
another prominent conservatives characterization of the 
organization as a campaign exploratory committee is off base 
thats plain wrong du pont said of the description by 
richard viguerie in a opinion piece last week in the new york 
times 
du pont said there is a legal difference between issueoriented 
political action committees like his and exploratory campaign 
committees 
this is the fourth organization like this ive started in my 
career and each time there has been speculation that this is just a 
shell this is a specific committee to deal with the economy 
he said 
he said the committee is not antibush but he remains staunchly 
opposed to the tax increases in the deficitreduction package 
passed with administration support in october it was an awful 
bill and we hope the administration will come home du pont said

anc leader nelson mandela 
celebrating his first christmas at home in nearly 30 years 
appealed to south africans today to work for peace so blacks never 
again spend the holiday in chains 
in pretoria anc president oliver tambo met for the first time 
with president fw de klerk today the meeting was described as a 
courtesy visit afterward tambo told reporters he hoped south 
africa would have a full recovery from apartheid by christmas 
next year 
an information ministry statement said de klerk wished tambo 
continued recovery from a severe stroke he suffered in august 1989 
and said both agreed violence must end for proper negotiations to 
begin 
speaking to reporters in his soweto home mandela recalled his 
first christmas in the notorious robben island prison where he was 
sent after being convicted of plottng against the government and 
sentenced to life in prison 
inmates were not permitted family visits and celebration was 
limited to eating sweets provided by the church mandela said 
he paused then said with a smile ive never cared for sweets 
in my life but in prison i thought that they were very delectable 
indeed 
as years went by he said conditions improved prisoners were 
allowed to order special groceries for the holiday and created 
their own celebrations 
but that is nothing compared to what i look forward to at the 
moment when i am able to celebrate christmas as a free man said 
mandela who was freed from prison in february 
mandela deputy president of the african national congress read 
a 2page message in which he lamented continuing political 
violence but expressed optimism for a peaceful future 
the south africa so many have sacrificed so much to achieve is 
in sight he said and he urged people of all political 
affiliations to persist in their noble efforts to solve the 
nations problems peacefully 
let us vow never to celebrate another christmas in chains 
he said 
mandela did not mention the government or de klerk but appeared 
to direct his message at them when he said 
our thoughts turn to all those others in the country who will 
not be with their families those who are still held as political 
detainees and prisoners i also refer to the thousands of our 
people who are still in exile who like the prisoners had hoped 
that in light of the changes taking place in our country they too 
would be spending christmas with their relatives 
in other developments today police said eight people died over 
the weekend in unrest in natal province including two people shot 
to death by police the unrest report did not specify exactly when

conservative lawmakers submitted a resolution to 
the national parliament today demanding daily government briefings 
on the persian gulf crisis and a vote before any soviet troops are 
sent to the region 
the resolution was put forward by col viktor alksnis on behalf 
of the increasingly vocal hardline soyuz faction 
the resolution says president mikhail s gorbachev needs 
permission from the supreme soviet legislature before he can send 
military forces abroad the independent interfax news agency said 
the supreme soviet is the standing legislature elected by the 
2250member congress of peoples deputies now holding its fourth 
session in the kremlin 
interfax said the resolution also calls for the foreign ministry 
to brief the supreme soviet daily on the gulf situation 
it also asks a special legislative session held on the topic 
jan 14 the day before a united nations deadline for iraq to 
withdraw from kuwait or face a possible military attack 
the soviet union voted for the un security council resolution 
authorizing use of force after the date but has not committed any 
troops to participate in an attack 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze who announced his 
resignation last week repeatedly denied there were any plans to 
send soviet troops to the region 
shevardnadze had accused alksnis the lawmaker who put forth the 
resolution of persecuting him alksnis was quoted today by the 
german newspaper stuttgarter nachrichten as calling for a 
parliamentary investigation of shevardnadze with what he called 
criminal consequences

for many christmas is a time of peace and 
religious celebration but for atheists it can be a time to protest 
nativity scenes in city halls or crosses in parks 
many such symbols of religion overlapping into secular society 
are disappearing as activists work yearround to build a stronger 
wall between church and state 
some targets are obscure like the notice for a church event 
posted on a park districts community event board others cant be 
missed such as the god reigns motto blazoned in a city seal 
across a 136foot water tower 
the crusade may not be vehement but constitutional wrongs must 
be righted said robert i sherman national spokesman for american 
atheists inc 
i dont go out trolling for crosses but often people will see 
a display and if it offends them theyll call me sherman said 
the constitutional separation between church and state has been 
a perennial battlefield for atheists and religious believers 
atheists have maintained that religious symbols have no place in 
government or on public property churches have argued that they 
have a right to express their beliefs in public forums and that to 
do so does not violate the separation of church and state 
the us supreme court has ruled several times on the issue 
most recently in october when it refused to allow the display of a 
christmas nativity scene on the lawn of a county government 
building in charlottesville va 
in other rulings however the court has ruled that religious 
symbols can be displayed in some cases when secular symbols are 
alongside them 
shermans group is one of the most active in opposing religious 
displays on public property 
in one case sherman challenged lighted christmas crosses on two 
water towers in wauconda although they were a 42year tradition 
the village backed down last december and quit erecting them 
many of the nations test cases stem from shermans vigilance 
including a fouryear fight against the town motto of zion god 
reigns a federal appeals court is reviewing an appeal by zion of 
a lower court ruling that the motto must go 
activists also have demanded that officials move nativity scenes 
off city hall lawns that pta officials stop saying prayers before 
meetings and that cities stop paying for community prayer 
breakfasts 
in utah the printing of in god we trust on us currency is 
again an issue and the practice of granting churches taxexempt 
status is being questioned in texas 
even the oath for the boy scouts of america has come under fire 
for requiring members to pledge to do my duty to god and my 
country objectors say the scouts are tacitly governmentlinked 
because some groups are sponsored by public schools 
what we are dealing with is a war of symbols said madalyn 
murray ohair founder of the texasbased american atheists which 
claims 50000 families as members 
if you accept the symbol you accept everything that goes with 
it she said broad symbols become a beckoning to breach the 
wall of separation between church and state 
another american atheists success came in downers grove where a 
high school football coach stopped leading a postgame prayer after 
sherman raised a challenge 
saying the lords prayer after games did represent a violation 
of the separation of church and state said school superintendent 
david hendrix we felt that we had erred 
some cities like zion would rather fight 
the town of fewer than 20000 about 50 miles north of chicago 
has spent more than 100000 defending the municipal seal 
officials said residents have donated about a third of the money 
the seal displayed on the citys water tower and vehicles 
features a cross a dove of peace and the motto 
zion officials argue that the seal has a historic rather than 
religious value in the city founded as a utopian community in 1902 
by a faith healer 
we are entitled to reflect the heritage of our town said 
mayor adeline geokaris the majority of our people support the 
seal 
but fighting the atheists challenges can be too costly for 
cities forced to hire expensive legal help while american atheists 
has a salaried inhouse attorney 
thats the beauty of the whole thing ohair said

chinese authorities have freed a university 
professor who had been under detention at a guest house in central 
china for 15 months a hong kong newspaper reported today 
the independent ming pao daily news said wen yuankai a 
chemistry professor at hefei university in anhui province was 
released on dec 17 
fang lizhi the exiled chinese dissident and astrophysicist 
taught at the same university before he was stripped of the post in 
early 1987 following studentled prodemocracy protests on the 
campus 
the paper quoted wen as saying that he was initially kept in a 
secret place in the campus area but later was transferred to a 
guest house run by police 
the report did not say why wen 44 was released he was 
arrested following the violent military crackdown on the 
prodemocracy movement in china last year when hundreds perhaps 
thousands of activists were killed 
after the repression the chinese authorities began nationwide 
arrests 
according to ming pao wen had been arrested for his stubborn 
insistence on bourgeois liberalization a term used by communist 
chinese authorities to criticize the capitalist western world 
the professor said that during his detention he was allowed to 
read newspapers and overseas science journals receive family 
letters and watch television but family members were not allowed 
to visit him the paper said 
during his confinement wen taught himself japanese and finished 
a 200000word research paper ming pao said 
wen said officials at hefei university told him he could return 
to his previous teaching and research post but that he has not 
received any formal notice as to when he might resume his duties 
the paper said 
i hope im not going to end up working as a cashier at the 
university canteen in that case id rather work as a hawker and 
sell boiled eggs on the street the newspaper quoted wen as 
saying 
wens reported release came as authorities in beijing prepared 
trials for activists considered the most serious offenders in last 
years prodemocracy turmoil several other dissidents have also 
been released recently they include wang zhihong wife of chen 
ziming publisher of a nowbanned journal who had been jailed for 
more than a year without formal charge 
her husband chen ziming is charged with trying to overthrow 
the government and could receive a maximum penalty of death

representatives of a nobel peace prizewinning 
group of physicians said the international embargo against iraq has 
gone too far causing the infant mortality rate there to double 
the embargo is not only working at this point it is 
inhumane said dr john pastore secretary of the international 
physicians for the prevention of nuclear war 
the blockade is total no vaccines no medicines are 
reaching iraq said william monning an attorney and executive 
director of the cambridgebased group 
monning also said that jordan which took in more than 700000 
kuwaiti refugees has had problems receiving aid 
pastore said sanctions against iraq have led to a shortage of 
milk for infants and medicines for the general public 
five members of the physicians group three from the united 
states one from the soviet union and one from germany took an 
eightday tour of medical and health centers in the persian gulf 
including centers in baghdad several participants returned to 
bostons logan international airport on saturday 
the group which received the peace prize in 1985 said 
embargoes against iraq have not been limited to economic and 
military supplies but also foods and medicines considered exempt 
for humanitarian reasons 
officially medicine is not embargoed under the un sanctions 
and food may be sent in if the un security councils committee on 
sanctions decides it is needed for humanitarian purposes the 
committee has allowed several shipments of food to foreign 
nationals who were running short on provisions but not any for the 
general public in iraq or kuwait 
the iraqis claim that despite the exemption of medicine the 
naval and air embargo is halting shipments of medicine and they 
say babies are endangered by shortages of formula 
some western diplomats in baghdad are skeptical about the iraqi 
claim on medicine suggesting that medicine is being diverted from 
the civilian population to the army 
dr bernard lown copresident of the physicians group said he 
realizes the un embargo does not include medical supplies but 
still they are not getting through 
we could see the end result he said too many doctors 
the red cross unicef do not have drugs in baghdad today 
lown said medical workers told him suppliers would not sell 
medicine to them nobodys stopping the drugs but nobodys 
selling them he added 
pastore said the physicians group will ask the united nations 
to reevaluate the embargoes 
we think the united nations should investigate the situation 
because its a violation of the geneva convention and all other 
humanitarian conventions to embargo humanitarian supplies 
pastore said saturday 
pastore said 32000 tons of dried milk paid for by iraq sits in 
turkey because of the sanctions he said the scarcity of milk has 
driven the price up to about 21 for two quarts 
the physicians group representatives met political leaders in 
jordan and spoke with parliament members in iraq they did not meet 
with iraqi president saddam hussein but we are hoping the 
physicians there will influence the iraq government lown said

against potential attacks on christmas eve as the military observed

source said 
iraq in a sign of rising tensions summoned its ambassadors to 
the united states and the united nations to baghdad for 
consultations with president saddam hussein the iraqi embassy in 
washington said 
the embassy spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said 
the envoy to washington mohamed almashat and un ambassador 
abdul alanbari were expected to remain in baghdad for a week or 
two he declined to elaborate 
saddam meanwhile told spanish television that tel aviv will be 
iraqs first target if war breaks out the iraqi president had 
threatened the jewish state even before the gulf crisis began 
nearly five months ago but it was the first time he said israel 
would be iraqs first target 
the spanish tv network summarized saddams remarks made 
saturday and said the interview with him would be shown on 
wednesday 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said in response that iraq 
would be harmed in a most serious way if it attacks israel 
asked whether war was likely he said on israel radio i would 
say the danger is very close 
a senior palestine liberation organization official was quoted 
today as saying the plo would fight alongside the iraqis if war 
breaks out 
we have coordinated our plans to fight with iraq in one 
trench hani alhassan plo chairman yasser arafats chief 
political adviser told the iraqi daily newspaper aljumhuriya 
gen norman schwarzkopf the commander of us forces in the 
persian gulf had told reporters last week the us troops would be 
ready to counter any military move by iraq over the holidays 
we are going to be on a heightened state of alert 
schwarzkopf said i dont tell the enemy anything but i will 
damn sure tell saddam hussein that he should not expect us to be 
al stood down on christmas and think that hes going to catch us 
napping and asleep on christmas day thats not going to happen 
a military source who spoke on condition of anonymity confirmed 
the heightened alert status today in saudi arabia sentries at 
military guardposts made more thorough checks than usual and saudi 
arabian police had checkpoints set up on highways 
however most troops had a lightduty day meaning they could 
sleep late or engage in sports activities

of 21 bodies of us troops killed in the sinking saturday of an 
israeli ferry the other bodies were being flown back to the united

behind closed tent flaps 
the sacrifices you make will never be forgotten america is 
behind you the world is behind you and history is behind you 
president bush said in a christmas message to us troops worldwide 
scheduled for broadcast today 
bush was meeting today with defense secretary dick cheney who 
ended a fiveday trip to the middle east on sunday 
cheney declined to say whether the united states has a timetable 
to attack iraqi forces if saddam ignores a unimposed jan 15 
deadline to quit kuwait last week lt gen calvin ah waller 
said american ground forces would not be ready for combat until 
about a month after the deadline 
but cheney said on sunday we would be prepared today if we 
were ordered today to take military action 
britains defense secretary tom king told the british 
broadcasting corp today that iraq would be very severely 
beaten if war breaks out in the gulf there will be no question 
about the outcome king said 
iraqs foreign minister tariq aziz was quoted in the los 
angeles times today as saying that iraqi officials were still 
willing to meet for talks with the bush administration on jan 12 
bush has rejected any date later than jan 3 as too close to the 
un deadline for secretary of state james a baker iii to visit 
baghdad as offered 
in other developments 
conservative soviet lawmakers submitted a resolution to the 
parliament today demanding daily government briefings on the 
persian gulf crisis and a vote before any soviet troops are sent to

legislative session held on the topic jan 14 the day before the 
un deadline for an iraqi withdrawal 
representatives of a nobel peace prizewinning group of 
physicians said the trade embargo against iraq has gone too far 
causing the infant mortality rate there to double dr john 
pastore secretary of the international physicians for the 
prevention of nuclear war called the embargo inhumane the 
embargo allows for humanitarian shipments and diplomats and some 
doctors in baghdad have said there was no shortage of basic food 
and medicines 
the saudis angered french defense minister jeanpierre 
chevenement by refusing to allow a french rock n roll star to 
perform for troops camped in the desert the french embassy said 
eddy schmoll mitchells 1950sstyle music apparently offends 
countrys strict moslem tenets the spokesman said chevenement

the increased demand for shipping to the 
middle east brought on by the persian gulf crisis has caused 
shipping costs paid by the pentagon to soar military and industry 
sources said today 
we walk with big feet in the market margaret b holtz a 
spokeswoman for the navys military sealift command said when 
you charter the number of ships that we charter its going to have 
an effect on the price 
its a question of supply and demand said robert w 
kesteloot a shipping consultant in reston va who retired in 
1986 after six years as the navys director of strategic sealift 
the shippers run a great risk if they accept cargo going out 
there kesteloot said 
he said that if shippers displace other cargo to take on the 
military loads they may not get the other customers back after the 
crisis in the gulf is over 
kesteloot said he knew of charter ships that were now bringing 
in more than 50 percent more than they could demand six months ago 
he said container rates have also risen sharply 
the new york times in an article published today said the navy 
has been paying nearly 8000 for each standard 40by8by 8 
12foot steel container used to send supplies to the gulf from the 
east coast the times said this is twice what some commercial 
shippers now pay 
the newspaper also said that the sealift command was paying 
7000 to 8500 a day to charter mediumsized multideck 
freighters that brought 6000 to 6500 a day last summer 
ms holtz said she could not comment on the figures which the 
times obtained from industry sources brokerage and shipping 
offices contacted for confirmation were closed for the christmas 
holiday 
in a statement supplied to the times vice adm francis r 
donovan the commander of the military sealift command said the 
rates being paid were not particularly high in light of the 
shortterm requirement diversion of ships from commercial 
employment and uncertain condition in the middle east

the congress of peoples deputies today endorsed 
the concept of a new union treaty designed to hold the 15 republics 
together and it voted to keep the word socialist in the 
countrys name 
the 2250member congress endorsed the idea of preserving the 
soviet union as a federation of equal sovereign states 
guaranteeing the rights of all nationalities 
the treaty must still be approved by the republics 
legislatures 
in the 1365to189 vote with 170 abstentions the deputies also 
agreed to retain the name union of soviet socialist republics 
a legislative committee had proposed changing the name to the 
union of sovereign republics to reflect the republics growing 
autonomy 
the soviet congress also gave a vague general endorsement to 
president mikhail s gorbachevs proposed changes in the structure 
of government constitutional amendments are needed to be approved 
by the congress before the changes can be put into effect 
the resolution did not spell out gorbachevs proposals which 
include creating a federation council made up of leaders of the 
republics a national security council and a vice presidency 
lawmakers also approved a resolution requiring all state 
enterprises to sign agreements to provide the government with at 
least the same level of supplies in the first quarter of 1991 they 
provided in the first quarter of 1990 
economic relations between regions and enterprises are being 
cut the relationship between goods and money is being broken 
inflation is rising prices are going up the provision of 
foodstuffs and industrial goods to the population is sharply 
worsening crime is growing and the standard of living is 
falling the resolution said 
earlier alexander zhuravlev a deputy from the byelorussian 
capital minsk set off a raucous debate by suggesting that the 
country call itself simply russia 
zhuravlev said our fatherland is russian and so i propose 
that we call ourselves as we did in the past russia 
his suggestion was greeted by a chorus of hisses in the kremlin 
meeting 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak proposed instead that the 
congress adopt the name favored by the late nobel prize winning 
dissident andrei sakharov the union of soviet republics of 
europe and asia 
other delegates chipped in with union of soviet republics 
and the treaty between russia and its colonies 
congress chairman anatoly lukyanov cut off the debate telling 
the deputies to put your emotion back in your pocket 
in a second nonbinding measure the congress voted 1491 to 88 
with 141 abstentions to back the union treaty which president 
mikhail s gorbachev has said is needed to keep the soviet state 
from breaking apart 
the congress the countrys highest lawmaking body began the 
second week of its session today and is expected to vote on the 
constitutional amendments to strengthen gorbachevs presidency 
gorbachev wants direct control over a reorganized executive 
branch of government to deal with a worsening economy and a 
fragmenting union 
he also is expected to make changes in the leadership before the 
end of the week is out including naming a vice president 
the union treaty which would replace a 1922 document would 
give more economic autonomy to the republics while the central 
government in moscow retains control over foreign policy banking 
taxation defense transportation and communications 
the treaty must be adopted by the 15 republics all of which 
have have declared some form of independence or sovereignty and 
seek first off to wrest economic control from central authorities 
the congress later voted to require every republic to hold a 
referendum asking its residents whether they want to remain in a 
restructured union and to approve gorbachevs proposal for a 
national referendum on private property ownership the supreme 
soviet the smaller standing legislature was asked to draft the 
precise wording of both referenda and set dates for voting 
gorbachev has said hed like a vote on both issues this winter 
the legislature of the russian federation which encompasses 
threequarters of the soviet land mass has already approved 
private property and russian president boris n yeltsin has said 
there is no need to hold a referendum 
on sunday tass quoted lithuanian president vytautus landsbergis 
as accusing the kremlin of attempting to impose the union treaty on 
the baltic republic through threats of bloodshed and use of 
violence and calling it essential to prepare means of 
resistance selfdefense 
about 1500 people on sunday marched in support of eduard 
shevardnadze who resgned thursday as foreign minister to protest 
the growing influence of hardliners and what he said was a coming 
dictatorship 
shevardnadze is with us gorbachev is against us 
shevardnadze stay with us pleaded one sign held aloft on a 
broken hockey stick

christmas can be a recurring nightmare for 
people who have lost close relatives to violent crimes 
we havent put up a tree in three years said rocky 
pennington whose two daughters cheryl genzer 25 and lisa 
pennington 16 were murdered sept 23 1987 we dont have any 
reason to celebrate 
to cope pennington and more than two dozen others met last week 
for a christmas gathering by a group called survivors of homicide 
at the gathering jerry and debbie maguire sat quietly grief 
and disbelief still frozen on their faces this will be their first 
christmas without children justin 14 and sammie 11 who were 
found shot and gagged in a closet in their el reno home on july 14 
this also will be the first christmas for ken busch without his 
7yearold daughter kathy who was stabbed to death and left in a 
trash bin in yukon last february 
busch said he would celebrate christmas if only for the sake of 
his two remaining children 
i wish i could sleep right through this busch said its 
going to be difficult and i really want kathy to be here but i 
have to go on for the living 
judy busch kathys grandmother acted as the groups moderator 
she founded the group sept 3 with the help of robert brown an 
oklahoma city counselor 
we need to realize we are doing all right that we are going 
to get through this mrs busch said its not been easy there 
are a lot of things to think about during this holiday 
pennington and his wife charlet are spending the holiday 
season in court taunted pennington says by the legal system 
the media and the man accused of killing their daughters 
we have to go into that courtroom and that creep just grins at 
us forcing us to brush past him as we walk in pennington said 
he claims he has religion he says god has forgiven him but i 
wont forgive him 
john and bonnie kruegers 31yearold son randy was found dead 
of a gunshot to the head june 9 they suspect randy was murdered 
were in total limbo krueger said emotionally you just 
cant cope the family tells you to forget but then the police ask 
you to remember every little detail 
how are you supposed to forget mrs krueger asked when i 
was putting up the christmas tree i found randys first grade 
pictures 
family members should not forget brown said 
something that we do different here is that we focus on the 
victims lives prior to the murder brown said 
so much of what they remember of the victim is the murder so 
much of what they are focused on is that dark day he said 
this helps them get the victims life into perspective

hes famous for his homespun eloquence 
and the puckish charm of his portraits of young americans making 
their way in the 20th century but even norman rockwell 
occasionally goofed 
from an unflattering portrait of a cows posterior to a baseball 
study with the umpire looking the wrong way works that rockwell 
banished to a drawer are getting a second look in a new exhibit at 
the norman rockwell museum 
its called flops 
it was sort of as a joke the idea started said curator 
maureen hart hennessey 
but after it began to take shape organizers realized the 
exhibit which takes its title from a chapter in rockwells 
autobiography showed a new side of the illustrator and shook up 
the museums routine 
i think sometimes theres a tendency to think that were some 
kind of shrine to rockwell and thats not true she said 
of his own work rockwell wrote that sometimes he found ive 
been molding a handful of air 
but some of the pictures hanging in a room of the little white 
house that houses the museum hardly seem to merit rockwells scorn 
were not saying that these things are flops hennessey 
said guides occasionally ask visitors if they agree with 
rockwells assessment of his work its raised a lot of good 
questions for us 
one piece dominates the room a large panoramic mural of the 
soviet british and us ambassadors sitting at a session of the 
un security council behind them crowd about 70 figures 
representing everyone from a typical us family to starving 
children of the world 
in his autobiography my adventures as an illustrator 
rockwell tells of his travails with the work he said he could not 
persuade us ambassador henry cabot lodge to smile and couldnt 
stop soviet delegate andrei vishinsky from beaming 
but eventually wrote rockwell the work seemed empty and 
pretentious 
for another flop rockwell went to the trouble of staging 
baseball players stan musial and joe garagiola for a picture of a 
burly umpire daintily sweeping home plate all went well until 
rockwell realized that a real umpire would never face the pitcher 
turning his backside to the grandstand 
one of the flops simply failed to find an audience 
for a saturday evening post cover that was supposed to be a 
whodunit rockwell posed several famous actors ranging from ethel 
barrymore to lassie all that was visible of the victim van 
johnson was a pair of legs with spats protruding from beneath a 
table visual cues tip off the astute viewer to the method and 
murderer 
but the post decided it just wasnt up to scratch rockwell 
wrote the movie stars kill it the editors said the readers 
will be so busy recognizing the stars that the idea will be lost 
what the failed pictures may show is an artist uncomfortable 
with famous subjects hennessey said 
he says in his autobiography that he was more comfortable 
staying in his own back yard and painting his neighbors she 
said 
out of a sevendecade career that produced more than 3000 
works rockwell spent the last 25 years of his life in stockbridge 
immortalizing the towns picturesque new england setting and 
several of its residents 
the small exhibit of flops which opened in november and runs 
through january 1992 has been getting a chuckle from very 
serious people said museum spokeswoman beatrice snyder 
perhaps the funniest picture in the room is a calendar 
illustration called mrs olearys cow the cow is craning its neck 
to peer at a lighted lamp within striking distance of her left hind 
hoof 
turned out to be my worst failure rockwell observed in his 
book not that it was a bad painting but who wants to look at 
the rear end of a cow for twelve months

the chapel is simple and the pews are 
planks propped on stones after nearly 26 years in jail in a 
country he calls the hell of the world a christmas dream has 
come true for the leader of albanias roman catholics 
for the first time since 1967 when albania became the only 
communist state to outlaw religion simon jubani and thousands of 
his flock can gather to celebrate the birth of jesus 
greek orthodox believers in southern albania have opened three 
churches 
moslems are repairing some of the few mosques that survived 
state efforts to wipe out religion moslems make up about 70 
percent of albanian believers another 20 percent are orthodox and 
10 percent are catholic 
the miraculous change in believers fortunes came in november 
after the ruling communists lifted the ban on religion as part of 
limited reforms in the isolated backward land of 33 million 
people 
young people in shkodra who had dared to preserve their catholic 
faith took over this small chapel in a rundown cemetery 
since nov 4 jubani said mass has been celebrated every day 
from 1000 to 2000 people flock daily to the chapel on the city 
boulevard named for the father of stalinist albania enver hoxha 
jubani was jailed eight times for nearly 26 years on charges of 
propagandizing against the atheist communism brutally imposed by 
hoxha 
he was surprised when the government freed him in april 1989 
and he began celebrating mass in secret in his home 
without the changes wrought in the communist world by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev jubani said he would have served 
out the remaining 20 years of his last sentence 
asked how he survived jails in which he said at least 100 roman 
catholic priests had died jubani said he was sustained by faith in 
the traditional catholicism of shkodra 
as byzantine power could not do anything to us for 900 years 
and ottoman power could not do anything for 500 years so the 
communists also could do nothing to us the 63yearold priest 
said with a smile shkodra he said is like an oasis in the 
albanian desert 
shkodra is reputedly one of europes oldest cities and was for 
centuries a center of catholicism under hoxha it decayed as funds 
flowed south to his hometown of gjirokaster near the greek border 
reported unrest in shkodra earlier this year and perhaps the 
influence of hoxhas successor ramiz alia a shkodra native have 
led the communists to pay more attention to albanias third city of 
about 80000 
but that was not sufficient to quell an explosion of popular 
anger this month after alia announced that other political parties 
would be permitted after 46 years of oneparty rule 
a hoxha statue was blown up local communist headquarters and 
the radio station vandalized and hundreds of windows smashed before 
security forces intervened 
we are living in political chaos said jubani referring to 
the turmoil and hatred that could be unleashed by the communists 
reforms 
his chapel is a haven of humanity and believers have given it 
the spirit of christmas 
one carefully painted a wooden altarpiece another brought 
virgin mary portraits and other artifacts jubani said were hidden 
from the communists by the religious spirit always in our 
hearts 
other believers proudly showed a nativity scene 
albania is the hell of the world jubani said referring to 
the communist rule of terror that he said extended even to pulling 
gold from the teeth of corpses in shkodra cemeteries 
the communists built here in albania their kingdom of 
ignorance their kingdom of poverty their kingdom of immorality 
jubani said 
now the first opposition group the democratic party has asked 
for his support jubani demanded in return that the new party 
pledge to help restore all churches schools and monasteries to 
catholics 
albanias believers also need bibles and money to restore 
churches that have survived 23 years as warehouses or cattle sheds 
shkodras roman catholics got back one church last week still to 
come is the former cathedral currently used as a sports hall 
adorned with communist slogans 
for now however it is enough simply to celebrate christs 
birth 
for the first time in 23 years there will be midnight mass 
jubani said beaming as he bade farewell to foreign reporters 
merry christmas

maine consumers will become the nations 
busiest recyclers next monday when the states bottle deposit law 
is expanded to include nearly all nondairy beverage containers 
even though maine residents will have to rinse save and return 
more bottles and cans than ever they seem to be taking the new law 
in stride 
it will probably be more of a nuisance in a sense said 
charlene haney of caribou i suppose once you get used to it it 
will be all right 
mrs haney said the need to reduce the mountains of throwaways 
filling landfills more than justifies the extra burden i 
understand why theyre doing this she said 
for more than a decade maine residents have been paying 
deposits on beer and soda containers under a law designed to reduce 
litter but with the advent of the solid waste crisis the law took 
on new meaning 
a comprehensive solid waste law expanded the bottle law to 
include liquor bottles as of jan 1 1990 and wine bottles on 
sept 1 1990 aseptic containers or juice boxes were banned 
in maine as of september 
as of dec 31 the bottle law will include all noncarbonated 
juice containers holding a gallon or less 
deposits are 5 cents except on liquor and wine bottles which 
carry a 15cent deposit 
excluded are containers for milk and other dairy products 
cider cough syrup sauces baby formula soup and vinegar 
maines new law considered the nations most expansive will 
increase by as much as 50 percent the 600 million tons of beverage 
containers already in the recycling stream according to denise 
lord of the maine waste management agency 
were geared up for it said gary hilliard president of 
returnable services inc whose company accepts pays refunds and 
sorts used bottles and cans before taking them to centers that 
recycle plastic metal and glass 
hilliard added space to his augusta warehouse by tearing out 
closets and using overhead room but he acknowledges that he may 
have to build an addition 
besides adding to the volume of containers being recycled and 
kept out of dumps maines law is also creating a new line of 
business for companies such as hilliards 
juice makers are hiring those companies to pick up their brands 
containers from restaurants and other retailers and take them to 
recycling centers beer and soda manufacturers in maine generally 
do that themselves 
ms lord said the law also has social benefits were seeing a 
real increase in the number of community organizations using bottle 
drives as fundraisers 
other states are watching carefully to see how maines law works 
out said pat franklin of the national container recycling 
coalition a washington dcbased advocacy group various 
components of maines law have been adopted in other states but 
maines law is the most comprehensive she said 
a few kinks in the law remain to be worked out its not clear 
for example whether grocers or companies hired to pick up empties 
must sort containers by manufacturer 
but that wont delay the new law even though a ruling by the 
state isnt expected until january said john joyce of the maine 
grocers association 
the law is expected to cause some manufacturers to pull products 
that sell poorly in maine said joyce other products may disappear 
briefly if manufacturers decide not to use temporary stickers while 
cans and bottles are being redesigned with marks showing they are 
returnable

when ha sinclaire eased his new 34000 
christmasred audi 100 quattro out of a northern virginia showroom 
recently he did so a few months earlier than he had planned and 
saved 400 in taxes 
all over the country welltodo people like sinclaire are 
rushing to buy before the federal government begins jan 1 imposing 
a new tax on fancy cars and other luxury items 
if i can avoid paying taxes i try said sinclaire a 
retired physician who lives in horse country around middleburg 
va just outside washington i dont like how theyre spending 
most of my money anyway 
as a gathering recession compels many americans to curtail their 
purchases some of the countrys tonier establishments are noticing 
a surge in spending among uppercrust shoppers eager to beat the 
tax 
the strength of the trend varies by product but luxuryitem 
retailers and manufacturers hope it will help sweeten what 
generally has been a lackluster buying season 
probably 30 percent of our customers are coming and saying 
its a factor in their decision said michael sclafani vice 
president of sovereign motor cars ltd in brooklyn ny which 
sells mercedesbenzs 
neiman marcus spokeswoman pat zajac says that sales managers at 
the companys 24 upscale department stores report increased 
purchases of expensive furs and jewelry both of which will be 
subject to the new tax at the firms dallas store recently she 
said a man ready to buy an 11000 fur decided to buy a 22000 
one instead when he learned of the tax savings 
the trend is most noticeable in the automobile industry where 
new levies will drive up the price of some cars by thousands of 
dollars independent auto analyst susan jacobs of little falls 
nj said topend cars are showing increased sales in november 
with bmw and jaguar sales up about 25 percent over october 
reversing a monthslong decline 
the swelling business is in part courtesy of a luxury tax in 
the budget package congress and president bush enacted in the fall 
beginning jan 1 it slaps a 10 percent tax on the amount paid 
above 30000 for cars 100000 for private boats 250000 for 
private planes and 10000 for jewelry and furs the government 
expects to reap 15 billion from the levy over the next five 
years 
the stakes are even greater for people shopping for cars that 
get low gasoline mileage which tend to be european imports the 
gasguzzler tax now ranging between 500 and 3850 will be 
doubled jan 1 
meanwhile many merchants especially auto and boat dealers 
are advertising that customers can avoid the tax by acting quickly 
on january 1 the tax man will be fishing for an extra 10 
percent announced hatteras yachts of high point nc in a 
recent wall street journal ad 
hatteras boats sell for 350000 to 6 million that means 
someone who buys before jan 1 will save at least 25000 in taxes 
the type of person in a position in life to buy our product 
didnt get there by taking money for granted said hatteras 
marketing director bryant phillips 
but not all luxury businesses are enjoying a prelevy rush of 
customers 
chairman michael roman of jewelers of america a trade 
association representing 13000 jewelry retailers says his 
industrys 20 billion annual income has been affected little by 
purchasers hoping to save money on the tax 
most jewelry purchases are to commemorate an event so youre 
buying with your heart roman said 
pittsburgh pa furrier carl herrmann said the slow economy and 
the uncertainty of the persian gulf crisis has canceled any 
business boost from buyers eager to avoid the tax 
theres a threeletter word sitting over peoples heads 
war said herrmann as for buying before the tax is imposed he 
said i havent heard that once 
the nations private aircraft makers seem barely affected by the 
new tax because about 90 percent of the 1500 planes sold annually 
will avoid the levy anyway said james gormley president of the 
industrys trade group 
planes that are used mainly for business or cost less than 
250000 will be exempt

after an emotional vote to keep socialist in 
the countrys name the soviet congress on monday endorsed the 
concept of a new union treaty to keep the nation from breaking 
apart 
the national parliament also voted to require every republic to 
hold a referendum asking its residents whether they want to remain 
in a restructured union 
lawmakers later approved president mikhail s gorbachevs 
proposal for a national referendum to decide whether to scrap 
communist ideology and allow private ownership of land 
the 2250member congress of peoples deputies charged the 
supreme soviet the smaller standing legislature which it elects 
to draft the precise wording of both referenda and set dates for 
them 
officials said votes on the private property referendum would be 
counted separately in each republic but it was unclear whether a 
few republics could permit private property if the majority did 
not 
the legislature of the republic of russia which encompasses 
threequarters of the soviet land mass already has approved 
private property boris yeltsin russias president and gorbachevs 
main political rival has said there is no need for a referendum 
alexander zhuravlev a deputy from the byelorussian capital of 
minsk set off hisses and a raucous debate by suggesting the soviet 
union rename itself simply russia 
a legislative committee had proposed changing the countrys name 
from the union of soviet socialist republics to the union of 
sovereign soviet republics to reflect the republics growing 
autonomy 
urging the congress to take a holy act the day before 
christmas zhuravlev said our fatherland is russian and so i 
propose that we call ourselves as we did in the past russia 
leningrad mayor anatoly sobchak proposed instead that the 
congress adopt the name favored by the late nobel prize winning 
dissident andrei sakharov the union of soviet republics of 
europe and asia 
other delegates chipped in with union of soviet republics 
and the treaty between russia and its colonies 
congress chairman anatoly lukyanov cut off the heated debate 
telling the deputies to put your emotions back in your pockets 
the congress then voted 1365189 with 170 abstentions to retain 
the name union of soviet socialist republics 
immediately after the vote a delegate who did not identify 
himself rose to object that it was meaningless 
we have voted for socialism but what kind of socialism he 
said 
stalinist socialism brezhnevtype socialism rationcard 
socialism or swedish socialism no matter what we name our 
country we still need to define its economic system 
the deputies paid no heed to his criticism and proceeded to 
endorse the general concept of a new union treaty proposed by 
gorbachev to hold the independenceminded republics together in a 
loose federation 
the congress vote of 149188 with 141 abstentions is not 
binding the treaty which would replace the 1922 document that 
formally created the soviet union must be adopted by the 
legislatures of the 15 republics 
in the past year all 15 republics have declared some form of 
political independence or economic autonomy in which their laws 
take precedence over national ones 
in the referendum envisioned by the congress citizens across 
the country will vote on the general question of whether their 
republics should stay in the soviet union and not on a specific 
treaty 
republics that vote not to remain in the soviet union still 
would not gain immediate independence gorbachev has insisted they 
follow a complicated secession law approved last spring that 
includes a waiting period of up to five years 
parliaments of several republics including georgia lithuania 
latvia estonia and armenia have said they will not sign a new 
union treaty 
gorbachevs proposed draft would give more economic autonomy to 
the republics while retaining a powerful central government in 
moscow with control over foreign policy banking taxation 
defense transportation and communications 
the congress also approved a resolution on the state of the 
union that included a vaguely worded nonbinding endorsement of 
gorbachevs proposed changes in the structure of government 
later in the week the lawmakers are expected to consider 
specific changes and constitutional amendments needed to put them 
into effect mondays resolution did not spell out gorbachevs 
proposals which include a national security council a vice 
presidency and a federation council made up of leaders of the 
republics

wilderness buffs worried about losing 
the arctic national wildlife refuges coastal plain to oil drilling 
have been visiting it in record numbers and may pose a threat of 
their own to the fragile area 
environmentalists fear the traffic is straining resources along 
the refuges major rivers 
commercial operators worry that hundreds of rafters hikers and 
photographers who come to see grizzlies caribou and untrampled 
tundra each summer are running into other people too 
rivers like the hulahula and the kongakut have lost some of 
their wilderness character said george heim of anchoragebased 
alaska river adventures 
youre not getting what you go up there for if you end up 
sharing the river with 20 other people and jockeying for 
campsites 
the us fish and wildlife service which has received 
complaints of crowding and litter from river users has started 
working on river management plans for the arctic refuge 
it took public comment through dec 15 on several plans phil 
garrett the assistant refuge manager said monday that a draft 
report on the agencys proposal should be done in several months 
and a final report should be issued by the end of september 1991 
its a complicated issue garrett said there are several 
different alternatives and a whole host of choices for each 
alternative they range from no regulation to no access by 
motorized vehicles 
fish and wildlife officials acknowledge that there may be 
problems in the the refuge 
when we took a look at the increase of use along selected 
rivers it became evident there was some reason for possible 
concern said tom edgerton the agencys fairbanksbased 
recreation planner for the arctic refuge 
he stressed that federal officials are trying to prevent 
potential problems and arent sure if higher visitor traffic 
actually is damaging wilderness 
i havent seen any documentation that shows damage to wildlife 
at this point but its one of the things that well be looking 
at said edgerton 
he said he has gotten reports of caribou harassed by airplanes 
and of litter along the rivers 
since 1985 commercial recreational use on the refuges three 
major rivers the kongakut hulahula and sheenjek has increased 
more than 500 percent from 355 visitors to 1794 in 1989 the 
number of visitors on private backpacking fishing or hunting trips 
isnt known edgerton said 
although those numbers are tiny compared to those at many 
national parks and refuges they have a stronger impact in this 
sensitive region of tundra and short growing seasons 
the farther north you go the slower it takes to recover 
edgerton said 
many of the environmental groups that oppose drilling on the 
coastal plain also are calling for greater recreational 
restrictions such as keeping group sizes to six and the number of 
river trips to one a week 
you certainly want people to be able to get out and enjoy 
their wilderness but the downside is people can love a place to 
death said sharon sturges of the environmental goup trustees 
for alaska 
some of the plans however would restrict access and activities 
not just by commercial recreationalists but by hunters trappers 
and others who use the arctic refuge 
ed grasser a hunting guide who visits the refuge in the 
offpeak months of august and september agreed river rafters 
perhaps should be restricted to ease crowding but he said his 
business shouldnt be limited unless wildlife populations are shown 
to have suffered 
its public land and as long as visitation is regulated to 
the point where habitat or wildlife arent being harmed i dont 
think its right to prohibit people from visiting simply because a 
small group of people have an aesthetic sense that they dont want 
to have violated grasser said 
if its actually doing environmental damage i sure havent 
been able to locate any thats a vast vast area 
the 19 millionacre refuge in the northeast corner of alaska was 
created by congress in 1980 but its 15 millionacre coastal plain 
was exempted from wilderness designation 
the oil industry believes huge oil fields lie beneath the 
coastal plain and has asked congress to approve drilling there

on the eve of his first free 
christmas in nearly 30 yearsnelson mandela on monday recalled 
bleak holidays in prison and expressed hope this holiday season 
will be south africas last under apartheid 
in a holiday message read at his soweto home the african 
national congress leader noted his brethren still in prison or 
exile and the political violence that has killed thousands of 
people in black townships 
this is a year that has been marked by moments both of hope 
and despair as it comes to its close the message we wish to 
convey is one of hope he said 
mandela 72 the ancs deputy president was freed in february 
after 27 years in prison 
shortly after he spoke anc president oliver tambo met for the 
first time with president fw de klerk tambo who ended 30 years 
in exile on dec 13 echoed mandelas desire that apartheid be 
abolished by christmas 1991 
the south africa so many have sacrificed so much to achieve is 
in sight mandela said in his message he urged people of all 
political persuasions to persist in their noble efforts to 
solve the nations problems peacefully 
asked to think back on his past christmases mandela recalled 
his first one at the notorious robben island maximumsecurity 
prison inmates were not allowed to have visitors and celebration 
was limited to sweets and biscuits provided by the church he said 
he paused then said with a smile ive never cared for sweets 
in my life but in prison i thought that they were very delectable 
indeed 
as years went by conditions improved prisoners were allowed to 
order special groceries for the holiday and created their own 
celebrations he said 
but that is nothing compared to what i look forward to at the 
moment when i am able to celebrate christmas as a free man said 
mandela seated in a highbacked leather chair in his lavish soweto 
home 
he did not mention the government or de klerk but appeared to 
direct his message at them when he said our thoughts turn to all 
those others in the country who will not be with their families 
those who are still held as political detainees and prisoners 
the government has agreed in principle to allow thousands of 
exiles to return and to free political prisoners but the anc has 
accused it of delaying the process 
mandela also decried what he called the unacceptable campaign 
of violence in black townships where eight more people died over 
the weekend 
most of the fighting involves xhosas and other supporters of the 
anc against backers of the zulubased inkatha freedom party 
both sides have accused security forces of playing a part in the 
unrest police deny the allegations 
mandela said a meeting between himself and inkatha leader 
mangosuthu buthelezi is crucial to peace and is on the cards 
the rival black leaders have not held peace talks this month they 
declined even to walk together through tokoza township during a 
tour by political and church leaders 
since being freed from prison mandela has met frequently with 
de klerk for talks aimed at setting up formal negotiations on a new 
constitution 
tambo met de klerk for the first time monday morning in 
pretoria the meeting was not announced in advance mandela 
mentioned it during his news conference and said no major political 
issues were expected to be discussed 
tambo later told reporters he hoped south africa would have a 
full recovery from apartheid by christmas next year an 
information ministry statement said de klerk wished tambo continued 
recovery from a severe stroke suffered in august 1989 and that 
both agreed violence must end for proper negotiations to begin

the state department said monday leftist 
rebels in el salvador are planning intensive military attacks in 
early 1991 as a followup to a nineday christmas truce they have 
unilaterally declared 
instead of negotiating to bring peace to el salvador in 1990 
the guerrillas have chosen to bring death and destruction to their 
country and its people department spokesman richard boucher 
said 
while professing to observe a truce they are preparing for 
more war he said 
he said the latest round of attacks by the fmln rebels caused 16 
civilian deaths and 108 civilian casualties the attacks on coffee 
and cotton farms public transport banks and other civilian 
property have put many poor salvadorans out of work 
these targets have no conceivable military value boucher 
said as the government has made more concessions at the 
bargaining table the fmln has stepped up violence and 
militarism

christmas is a solid and almost secular 
part of american life but it had to battle to establish itself in 
north america the holiday was banned in boston in 1659 and anyone 
caught feasting could be fined five shillings 
the ban was lifted 22 years later but two staunch puritan 
congregationalist scholars and clerics increase mather and his 
son cotton kept up the crusade against observing the holiday in 
new england 
increase thought christ probably had been born in september 
while cotton said the occasion in any event hardly justified 
mad mirth 
no such misgivings moved the south in virginia where 
anglicanism held sway there was no doubt christmas was meant to 
be celebrated 
john smith and his virginia companies recorded that they ate 
oyster fish meat wild fowl and bread on christmas day in 1608 
smith later recorded that wherever an englishman may be and 
whatever part of the world he must keep christmas with feasting 
and merriment 
in a new book keeping christmas the celebration of an 
american holiday historian philip reed rulon of northern arizona 
university recounts the battle christmas had to fight before it 
embedded itself into the marrow of the people 
the christmas chasm was largely a carryover from england where 
rulon notes episcopalians roman catholics lutherans members of 
the reformed sect and moravians kept the holiday while quakers 
scotchirish methodists baptists and the plain dutch 
mennonites brethren and amish joined congregationalists and 
presbyterians in rejecting christmas 
christmas was something the puritans wanted to purify the 
church of england from and the pilgrims founders of another 
american holiday thanksgiving intended to start fresh in the new 
world free of any of the roman catholic traditions that had been 
retained by the anglicans 
the name of christmas savors of superstition increase 
mather wrote in 1681 it can never be proved that christ was born 
on december 25 it is most probable that the nativity was in 
september the new testament allows of no stated holy days but the 
lords day 
cotton took a different tack he was willing to accept the 
notion of observing the birth of christ but thought christmas 
should have nothing to do with merriment 
can you in your conscience think that our holy savior is 
honored by mad mirth by long eating by rude revelling asked 
cotton 
but even in new england the battle was a lost cause 
against the iron will of the mathers pastor henry scougal 
preached a boston sermon that told the christmas story and made the 
case for celebration 
he askedcan we be insensible of our happiness when angels do 
so heartily congratulate it 
christmas suffered a setback in the revolutionary war it was 
associated with the defeated side the anglican english troops and 
their american tory sympathizers 
but thomas jefferson championed separation of church and state 
and that allowed christmas to become a festival free of both it 
was years later rulon says that baptists methodists and 
presbyterians brought the holiday back to the pulpit and pew

salman rushdie has embraced islam and promised not 
to authorize a paperback version of his controversial novel the 
satanic verses a group of islamic and egyptian officials 
announced today 
earlier this year rushdie had insisted on the need for a 
paperback version but a spokeswoman for his defense committee 
confirmed that the statement was genuine 
in a statement released by dr hesham elessawy president of 
the islamic society for the promotion of religious tolerance 
rushdie also declared that he did not agree with any statement 
uttered by characters in the book that cast aspersions on islam 
questioned the authenticity of the koran or rejected the divinity 
of allah 
he also agreed not to authorize any further translations of the 
work 
rushdie did not disavow the book but insisted today that it was 
a moral fable all the things that moslems found insulting he 
said take place in the dream of a man who has lost his mind he 
has lost his mind because he has lost his faith 
in a telephone hookup with a news conference organized by 
elessawy rushdie said it was up to the government of iran to 
remove the death sentence against him i feel a lot safer tonight 
than i felt yesterday he added 
rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since february 
1989 when iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said the 
writer deserved death as a blasphemer iran offered a 1 million 
bounty for rushdies death 
this is the way we hope that will earn rushdies release from 
his predicament this is how we intend to make him a free man 
said elessawy 
elessawy argued as he has in the past that rushdie could not 
be sentenced to death as an apostate because he was not a believing 
moslem 
now that rushdie has embraced the faith by declaring there is 
no god but allah and that mohammed is his last prophet elessawy 
said that the slate is wiped clean 
elessawy characterized rushdie as a convert and quoted the 
author as saying there is no difference between rushdie and 
islam 
other british moslems who have been prominent in the controversy 
demanded more from rushdie 
it puzzles me that he hasnt gone far enough to remove the 
hardback if thats the intention the moslem community has been 
suffering for a long time said sher azam of the council for 
mosques in bradford where the book had been publicly burned 
until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on 
azam said 
iqbal sacranie joint convener of the uk committee on islamic 
affairs said rushdies statement was a positive step however 
it seems to us that the most appropriate course of action is 
the withdrawal from circulation of this blasphemous book 
rushdie recently has come out of hiding for a television 
interview and on dec 5 he appeared at a london bookshop to sign 
copies of his latest book haroun and the sea of stories 
iran severed diplomatic relations with britain over the 
satanic verses but ties were restored in october after an 
18month break on dec 9 however iranian minister of culture 
mohammad khatami said the death sentence against rushdie could not 
be revoked 
elessawy said he met with rushdie on friday in a secure 
location 
he said they were joined at the meeting by dr mohammed ali 
mahgoub an egyptian government official who heads the supreme 
council of scholars of islamic affairs youssef ahmed el sharkawy 
2nd secretary at the egyptian embassy and two clergy from the 
regents park mosque in london 
according to elessawy rushdie made four points in the 
statement 
1 to witness that there is no god but allah and that 
mohammed is his last prophet 
2 to declare that i do not agree with any statement in my 
novel the satanic verses uttered by any of the characters who 
insults the prophet mohammed or casts aspersions upon islam or 
upon the authenticity of the holy koran or who rejects the 
divinity of allah 
3 i undertake not to publish the paperback edition of the 
satanic verses or to permit any further agreement for translations 
into other languages while any risk of further offense exists 
4 i will continue to work for a better understanding of islam 
in the world as i have always attempted to do in the past 
the satanic verses has sold more than 1 million copies in 
english almost threequarters of those in the united states and 
was on the sunday times of londons bestseller list for nearly a 
year it has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more 
than 20 countries 
rushdie born in bombay and now a naturalized british citizen 
has been in hiding since feb 14 1989 
moslems worldwide objected to rushdies use of the names of the 
prophet mohammeds wives for the prostitutes in his novel and the 
implication that mohammed wrote the koran islams holy book 
instead of receiving it from god 
in september 1989 a trade survey found booksellers in england 
divided on the question of stocking any paperback edition forty 
percent said they would not handle it 44 percent said they would 
according to publishing news 
a london newspaper the observer reported last year that viking 
penguin had decided to publish the paperback in 1990 but the 
company never made any announcement 
in january the company said it was unlikely to announce its 
plans in advance because of the security implications

the bush administration put thailand on notice 
monday that it will consider imposing retaliatory tariffs unless 
the country takes steps to improve the protection of american 
copyrights 
us trade representative carla hills announced that she had 
begun an investigation into thailands copyright enforcement 
practices 
we have repeatedly expressed our strong concern to thai 
officials at all levels that the rights of us copyright holders 
are not adequately safeguarded hills said 
unfortunately we have seen no improvement in thailands 
willingness to shut down the considerable illegal copying of us 
movies music books and computer software or to ensure that us 
companies obtain prompt and effective redress through thailands 
legal system she said in a statement 
the investigation was being conducted under a provision of us 
trade law known as section 301 that allows america to boost tariffs 
on a countrys imports if the administration makes a finding that 
american exports face unfair practices in another country 
hills acted after receiving a petition on nov 15 from the 
motion picture association of america the international 
intellectual property alliance and the recording industry 
association of america 
she said that her office wants to begin consultations 
immediately with the thai government in an effort to resolve the 
problem 
if those talks fail to produce an acceptable resolution of the 
case then the administration would have the power to target a list 
of thai exports to the united states for higher tariffs

israel will be iraqs first target if war breaks out the iraqi 
president was quoted as saying tel aviv would be targeted whether 
or not israel joined an international war effort against iraq 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir responded to the reported 
threat by telling israel radio that iraq will be harmed in a most 
serious way if it attacks israel 
 
a senior official of the palestine liberation organization 
israels most implacable enemy indicated in an interview that the 
plo would side with saddam if war broke out 
we have coordinated our plans to fight with iraq in one 
trench plo chairman yasser arafats chief political adviser 
hani alhassan told the iraqi daily newspaper aljumhuriya 
 
the readiness of us forces to fight was the topic as defense

day earlier from a fiveday trip to the middle east said american 
troops would be prepared today if we were ordered today to take 
military action

the state supreme court today struck down 
part of an anticrime initiative that would have stripped 
california defendants of any rights that are not provided in the 
us constitution 
the court upheld most of proposition 115 the socalled speedy 
trial initiative but struck down its broadest provision a 
repeal of independent state constitutional rights for criminal 
defendants 
the court ruled unanimously that the constitutional provision 
was such a fundamental change that it amounted to a revision of 
the state constitution which cannot be done by initiative 
the provision would have required california courts to follow 
us supreme court rulings in applying a long list of 
constitutional rights rather than more liberal rulings based on 
the state constitution 
but the court voted 61 to uphold the rest of the measure which 
was passed by voters in june and contained numerous provisions 
aimed at shortening trial and pretrial proceedings 
they included measures to reduce the length of preliminary 
hearings which can stretch for months and even years in 
california eliminating preliminary hearings after a grand jury 
indictment requiring judges rather than lawyers to question 
jurors and requiring defense lawyers to be prepared for trial in 
60 days 
the measure also expands the death penalty allows 16yearolds 
convicted of capital murder to be sentenced to life without parole 
and establishes penalties for a newly defined crime of torture 
in the opinion by chief justice malcolm lucas the court 
rejected the provision would have required state courts to follow 
us supreme court rulings in such areas as equal protection due 
process assistance of counsel speedy trial unreasonable 
searches privacy selfincrimination double jeopardy and cruel 
and unusual punishment 
california courts have interpreted many of those rights more 
broadly than federal courts for example state courts have 
construed privacy rights to limit police surveillance and have 
ruled some noncapital sentences to be cruel and unusual 
punishment 
in finding the proposed change to be a constitutional revision 
rather than an amendment the first such ruling since 1948 the 
court noted proposition 115 would have stripped state courts of the 
power to interpret fundamental defendants rights 
the only justice to vote against the majority ruling stanley 
mosk argued that the whole initiative should be thrown out saying 
its elements were so diverse that the measure violated the rule 
limiting initiatives to a single subject

a 51yearold elephant at the san diego zoo had 
to be killed because of injuries she suffered after falling 
headfirst into a concrete moat officials said 
maya an asian elephant who was the oldest mammal at the zoo 
apparently suffered torn ligaments in her legs sunday as she tried 
to climb out of the moat surrounding her enclosure said zoo 
spokesman jeff jouett 
veterinarians resorted to a fatal dose of sedative when maya was 
unable to stand on her own following a treatment of fluids 
painkillers and steroids 
i counted 27 people there trying to help jouett said 
when she would try to rock and stand up there was a lot of 
calling and urging to her 
elephants cannot convalesce while sitting or lying down because 
their weight exerts lifethreatening pressure on their lungs 
jouett said 
jouett said 51 is fairly elderly for an elephant but they have 
been known to live into their 60s in captivity 
maya who was captured in india and brought to the zoo nov 8 
1941 was bumped into the moat by another elephant two nearby 
keepers didnt see the fall but heard the commotion 
the 7100pound elephant was walking without difficulty in the 
moat but she apparently crippled herself while trying to climb out 
on bales of hay that zookeepers set up like steps jouett said 
maya then was fitted with a harness and lifted by crane into a 
sitting position but it was evident when workers tried to get her 
to stand that her legs wouldnt support her and she was then put 
to death 
elephants have been knocked into the moat before without 
suffering serious injury but jouett said mayas age may have made 
her accident worse tests after her death showed she suffered from 
degenerative arthritis in her legs 
he described her as a generally calm easygoing creature but 
one who often would assert herself to show she still led the herd 
theres some concern over how the remaining four elephants 
will react jouett said theyll notice shes gone and im sure 
it will be upsetting to them 
after the accident the zoos elephant mesa was closed to the 
public for the rest of the day

under the watchful eyes of 
israeli soldiers the roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem came to 
this biblical town monday to open the christmas season in the holy 
land 
hundreds of soldiers and police guarded bethlehem as a 
procession of whiterobed priests led the patriarch michel sabah 
into the church of the nativity built over a grotto where 
tradition holds that christ was born 
sabahs midnight mass in the neighboring st catherines church 
opened a holiday season in the holy land featuring three 
celebrations of christs birth the others are the greek orthodox 
christmas on jan 7 and the armenian orthodox celebrtion on jan 
19 
in past years bethlehems manger square would have been crowded 
and ablaze with lights but this year only a few dozen tourists 
wandered through manger square on christmas eve most visitors were 
scared away by the persian gulf crisis and the palestinian uprising 
against israeli occupation of the west bank and gaza strip 
father wally anthony a catholic priest from flint mich now 
with the church in rome noted the lack of tourists and the 
abundance of heavily armed police and soldiers 
sometimes when you read the scriptures you read about the 
soldiers there in the times of 2000 years ago and you can 
identify with that same kind of environment he said 
as in the past three years palestinian town officials canceled 
christmas celebrations the town had few decorations for the 
holiday and stores and restaurants were closed by a strike called 
by uprising leaders 
the israeli government sponsored a holiday choir concert but 
this year only one foreign choir from the first united methodist 
church of oklahoma city took part 
most color on the drab rainy day came from the red purple 
black and green berets of the israeli security forces 
soldiers and police guarded the five miles of roadway from 
jerusalem to bethlehem and hundreds stood around the square all 
visitors to manger square had to pass through metal detectors 
armed soldiers watched from atop the church of the nativity 
security was especially heavy because of a wave of stabbing 
attacks on israelis by arabs following the oct 8 temple mount riot 
in which israeli police killed 17 palestinians army curfews kept 
15000 arabs at home in three nearby refugee camps 
gabriele beitz a tourist from heidelberg germany was visiting 
with her husband and 11yearold daughter and said she found the 
situation in bethlehem very very fearful 
we are very depressed about the place and about the whole 
political situation here she said for us christmas is an 
event of peace and here you cannot feel peace 
in manger square sabah was greeted by the israeli military 
governor of bethlehem dudu mufaz in a tradition that extends back 
to the 19th century when palestine was ruled by the ottoman turks 
sabah the first palestinian to head the roman catholic church 
in the holy land wore purple robes he was led by hundreds of 
altar boys carrying candles as he went to pray in the grotto 
as a holiday gesture the military announced it was releasing 
217 palestinian prisoners arrested during the uprising 
bethlehems palestinian mayor elias freij told reporters he 
was praying for peace on earth and good will toward all people 
and peace in the holy land between israelis and palestinians and 
peace amongst all the arabs 
freij blamed the lack of tourists on us state department 
warnings for americans not to travel to the middle east 
the 25000strong arab christian community of nazareth 
meanwhile opened christmas celebrations monday with a traditional 
parade through the galilee town boy scouts from the towns 
different religious communities led the march along a 12mile 
route to the roman catholic basilica of the annunciation

the state department dismissed as unfounded 
and inaccurate on monday allegations by the soviet kgb chairman 
that western countries are attempting to weaken and subvert the 
soviet system under the guise of offering assistance 
we are concerned that such a senior soviet official would turn 
to this kind of outdated and inflammatory rhetoric which can only 
be described as inconsistent with the improvement that has taken 
place in both the substance and the atmosphere of ussoviet 
relations deputy spokesman richard boucher said 
on saturday kgb chairman vladimir a kryuchkov gave a speech to 
the soviet congress in which he warned that closer soviet links to 
the west posed hidden dangers for his country 
there are attempts from abroad to exert overt and covert 
pressure on the soviet union and to impose doubtful ideas and plans 
to pull the country out of the difficult situation kryuchkov 
said 
all these efforts often screen a desire to strengthen not so 
much us but their own position in our country specifically he 
accused the west of stimulating a brain drain and of sending 
contaminated grain 
in reply boucher said the allegations made the kgb chairman 
are completely unfounded and inaccurate the soviet unions 
internal difficulties as senior soviet officials themselves have 
readily admitted are the result of policies adopted in the past by 
the countrys leaders they can only be solved with fundamental 
political and economic reforms 
kryuchkovs speech occurred nine days after president bush 
approved us credit guarantees for soviet purchases of up to 1 
billion in american commodities he also proposed other ways of 
helping the soviets head off economic collapse including expertise 
in food distribution in addition he waived legislative 
restrictions on soviet access to us government credit programs 
bush said us policy is to help the soviet union stay the 
course of democracy and to undertake market reforms 
germany and other west european nations along with japan also 
are sending food to the soviets to help overcome growing shortages 
kryuchkov also generated concern here in his speech when he said 
that bloodshed may be required to restore order to the soviet 
union 
senate majority leader george mitchell dme said sunday a 
soviet crackdown along the lines threatened by kryuchkov could lead 
to a cutoff of us assistance to the soviets 
i dont think we should be providing any assistance if there 
is a crackdown and a return to authoritarian rule mitchell said

a special investigator on monday issued a 
warrant ordering former socialist premier andreas papandreou to 
testify in connection with a 210 million bank embezzlement 
scandal 
but legal sources said papandreou would not be arrested if he 
did not comply they said the warrant was a formality allowing 
investigator spyros spyrou to close his inquiry before handing it 
to a special court 
papandreou who governed from 1981 to 1989 and heads the 
opposition panhellenic socialist movement last month refused to 
testify he says his indictment by parliament last year is the work 
of his political rivals 
on monday his party said the warrant offers itself to obvious 
political exploitation by those who consider the process of a 
cleanup an exercise in political persecution and the elimination 
of their political rivals 
spyrou said last week that papandreous refusal to testify left 
the former premier in contempt of court media reported 
the warrant issued monday ordered that papandreou be forced to 
testify such warrants usually lead to a witness or a suspect being 
arrested if he does not comply 
vyron polydoras spokesman for the conservative leadership said 
the government had nothing to do with the warrant he said it was 
probably only a formality 
a conservativecommunist coalition government indicted 
papandreou and four senior cabinet ministers in 1989 on charges of 
authorizing and participating in an embezzlement scandal involving 
the privately owned bank of crete their trial date has not been 
set 
two conservative parliamentarians and a leftist lawmaker are 
acting as prosecutors in the case 
for the warrant to be carried out they must agree unanimously 
but one said in an interview published monday in the athens 
newspaper eleftherotypia that he did not support the warrant 
asked whether he thought the warrant would be carried out nikos 
galanos of the coalition of the left and progress said i 
consider it implausible

fellow authors supported salman rushdie on 
monday but worried about their profession after he promised not to 
authorize a paperback version of his novel the satanic verses 
rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since february 
1989 when iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said the 
writer deserved death as a blasphemer and iran offered a 1 million 
bounty 
his decision not to bring out a paperback edition and not to 
authorize any more translations was announced monday in london 
novelist hilma wolitzer said she was very sympathetic with a 
man who wants his life back 
im very sad about the tyranny that made him have to go into 
hiding and that makes him withdraw his book the freedom to write 
has been diminished she said 
faith sale a book editor and cochair of the freedom to write 
committee of pen the writers organization said the authors 
decision on paperbacks does not change the novel 
what he wrote stands but if there is some way that he can 
regain his life as a normal human being i have to support it 
said sale an acquaintance of rushdie 
this was one of the most horrendous things thats ever been 
visited on a writer she added pragmatism has to prevail here 
its unfortunate if the publishing arrangements have to be 
affected but hes already managed to reach an extremely wide 
audience with that book 
the satanic verses has sold more than 1 million copies in 
english almost threequarters of those in the united states it 
has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more than 20 
countries 
phones went unanswered monday at offices of vikingpenguin 
rushdies us publisher and its lawyer most publishing houses 
were closed until after christmas 
novelist allan gurganus said by telephone from chapel hill 
nc that the rushdie episode has been a setback for writers at 
a time when the first amendment is under siege from every 
quarter 
since every minority group has a subject that they find taboo 
to allow any group to exercise suppression is to suppress every 
subject since there is a group waiting to be offended by every 
interesting subject gurganus said 
its easy to judge rushdie in the abstract he said my 
sense is that if youre going to hide forever you might as well 
hide for a reason but i cant secondguess his motivation the 
truth is always unpopular in some ways

christmas isnt just christmas for vera wilcox 
its also the birthday of her daughter terry ann and daughter 
jean marie and daughter karen loraine 
all were born on dec 25 of 1951 1954 and 1960 respectively 
and now theres news from the youngest karen loraine hynes 
she said she was pregnant and the doctor said that our 14th 
grandchild was due on christmas mrs wilcox said i said oh 
my gosh wouldnt that be something 
that mrs wilcox would be something 
the three christmas sisters are among mrs wilcoxs six 
children another of whom came tantalizingly close to a christmas 
birth thats mary ellen born dec 20 1966 
brothers jim nov 18 1952 and lyle jr jan 23 1959 were 
further off the mark 
some people might feel sorry for terry jean and karen after 
all they went through childhood not only having to share their 
birthdays with each other but one might surmise receiving gifts 
on only one day a year 
but in fact their mother says the sisters didnt even 
celebrate their birthdays on their birthdays they celebrated on 
mary ellens birthday dec 20 mrs wilcox said that improved the 
girls chances of getting birthday gifts as well as christmas 
gifts 
 
tampa fla ap a florida national guard unit in saudi arabia 
is celebrating christmas in the desert with presents from strangers 
who know what its like to be on the front lines far from home 
an american legion post adopted the 810th military police co 
and for a month the veterans worked like elves packaging batteries 
soap razors and other items for the 160 mps 
with help from the ladies auxiliary and the post office an 
estimated 400 pounds of goodies were in saudi arabia waiting to be 
distributed monday and tuesday to the tampabased troops scattered 
across 100 miles of sandscape as part of operation desert shield 
the men and women of the 810th have already sent back a letter 
of thanks they included a poem written by spec murray n smith 
that reads in part 
we will not be home for christmas not with the ones we love 
whiskey rum beer and wine not one of the above 
i shed a tear of sorrow i feel the twists of pain i wish for 
many things to be i even wish for rain 
 
vicksburg miss ap mary louise caldwell solomon of 
vicksburg and jessie lee johnson coon of arcadia la are ending a 
48year christmas tradition this season 
the two friends have exchanged the same christmas card now 
yellowed and tattered on alternate years since 1942 but this 
year solomon received a phone call from coon asking her to keep 
the card and not return it to arcadia 
she has been in poor health solomon said she is afraid 
something will happen and the card will be lost at her house 
solomon said coon does not have any children 
i guess she feels like my children will keep it and cherish it 
after we are all gone because they have an idea of what it has 
meant to us through the years solomon said 
the first trip for the card occurred when coons husband leo 
purchased it at gowen air force base in boise idaho it went from 
the coons to the solomons in 1942 then from the solomons to the 
coons in 1943 
from then until now the coons and the solomons have exchanged 
the same card every christmas 
it makes me a little sad to think we wont be sending the card 
any more said solomon who has known her friend since the second 
grade i can understand how she must feel we are both 76 years 
old you cant help but think about the end after a certain age 
 
milwaukee ap albert rosen has been robbed at gunpoint 
reduced to tears by critics and teased about his jewish heritage 
during the 21 years he has volunteered as a substitute worker for 
christians on christmas 
but neither the negative experiences nor advancing age can stop 
the 72yearold retire housewares salesman from continuing the 
work that has earned him the title jewish elf 
rosen relishes the idea of giftgiving at christmas he proudly 
recounts some of the thanks he has received 
those he has helped tell him you are truly the spirit of 
christmas because you are giving of yourself rather than giving 
something material that doesnt have much value anyway he said 
rosens efforts earned him nationwide recognition in 1977 when 
nbc aired a hallmark christmas special about his work entitled 
have i got a christmas for you 
but rosen is quick to dispel thoughts that thanks and 
recognition are his motives 
brotherhood should be practiced as simple as buying a cup of 
coffee he said it should not require any recognition 
rosens volunteerism during past holiday seasons has landed him 
in such jobs as a bartender television news reporter gas station 
attendant mail clerk security guard and hotel bellhop 
this year rosen mulled retiring as a christmas elf he figured 
his efforts had promoted goodwill and his message had been spread 
but then his wife of 51 years sylvia stepped in and changed his 
mind 
theres never a time when its not important to help 
someone mrs rosen reminded her husband 
 
pompey ny ap all terry and ann christmas wanted for 
christmas was another christmas 
the suburban syracuse couple so named because terrys italian 
grandfather literally translated his last name natale into 
english after immigrating to the united states usually celebrates 
dec 25 in a big way they send their christmas cards via 
christmas fla or christmas mich for the postmark and they 
have a christmas license plate on their car 
but something had been missing for the christmases 
for the past five years the infertile couple have been futilely 
trying to adopt a healthy infant 
but by early saturday that miracle was completed as the 
christmases brought home a baby boy from romania 7weekold adam 
christmas 
we couldnt ask for a better present said ann 34 once 
we had the baby we wanted to be home by christmas i go to

a marines mother has a plan to form a christmas 
day link between us troops in saudi arabia and their families 
back home using the radio and the moon 
anne schiller of chicago says she got the idea for project 
monbeam shortly after her 21yearold son brian left for the gulf 
on oct 30 she said she was unable to reach him for about a week 
i was so upset she said but i was comforted by the fact 
that no matter where he was he could look up at the same moon i 
was looking at so when i finally talked to him again i told him 
that everytime he looks at the moon to let it remind him of all the 
love he has from home 
it really does make us both feel better she said 
schiller says she wants friends and families of us troops to 
join in singing christmas carols when the moon is visible in the 
united states and in the gulf at 3 pm est 
this is such a lonely time for them said schiller 44 
these kids are really down and i really think this might 
brighten their spirits 
in case moonbeams dont transmit the families messages to the 
gulf the armed forces radio and television network will air a 
recording of about 200 relatives and friends of gis overseas 
humming christmas carols 
at the same time about 5000 affiliates of five us radio 
networks will play a recording of the same group singing carols 
armed forces radio will play the hummed carols so saudis arent 
offended by the religious lyrics 
about 80 percent of the soldiers in the desert should be able to 
hear the braodcast at 11 pm saudi time 
armed forces radio has been advertising the simultaneous 
singalong and encouraging soldiers to look at the moon when it 
airs said lt col ray shepherd operations officer for the armed 
forces network based in alexandria va 
being a soldier away from home no matter where its nice to 
know someones thinking about you shepherd said

salman rushdie said monday that he has embraced 
islam and has given up his push for paperback publication of the 
satanic verses the book which brought him a death sentence from 
iran nearly two years ago 
he also pledged in a statement released by a local islamic 
leader that he would permit no further translations of the book 
however rushdie defended his book as a moral fable about a 
character who has lost his mind because he has lost his faith 
rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since february 
1989 when iranian leader ayatollah ruhollah khomeini sentenced him 
to death for blasphemy 
iran offered a 1 million bounty for rushdies death and 
iranian authorities reconfirmed the death sentence and the bounty 
earlier this month 
rushdies statement was released by dr hesham elessawy 
president of the islamic society for the promotion of religious 
tolerance he said rushdie typed the statement himself following a 
meeting with islamic scholars 
in his statement the author declared that he did not agree 
with any statement in my novel the satanic verses uttered by any 
of the characters who insults the prophet mohammed or casts 
aspersions upon islam or upon the authenticity of the holy koran 
or who rejects the divinity of allah 
rushdie said in a telephone hookup with a news conference that 
it is up to iranian leaders whether to withdraw the death sentence 
but he added i feel a lot safer tonight than i felt yesterday 
many moslems worldwide objected to rushdies use of the names of 
the prophet mohammeds wives for the prostitutes in his novel and 
the implication that mohammed wrote the koran islams holy book 
instead of receiving it from god 
elessawy said rushdie now had a clean slate with the moslem 
world because he had only now professed his belief that there is 
no god but allah and that mohammed is his last prophet 
in addition to elessawy rushdie met with two imams from the 
regents park mosque dr zaki badawi principal of the moslem 
college in britain and dr hohammed ali mahgoub egypts secretary 
of state for endowment and head of the supreme council for islamic 
affairs as well as yousef elsharkawy second secretary at the 
egyptian embassy 
rushdies statement was welcomed by other moslem leaders who 
nonetheless demanded that the book be withdrawn entirely from 
circulation 
until the book is completely removed our campaign goes on 
said sher azam of the council for mosques in bradford where the 
book had been publicly burned 
iqbal sacranie joint convener of the united kingdom committee 
on islamic affairs said rushdies statement was a positive step 
but also called for the withdrawal from circulation of this 
blasphemous book 
elessawy argued that rushdie could not be sentenced to death as 
an apostate because he had not been a believing moslem when he 
wrote the novel 
he characterized rushdie as a convert and quoted the author 
as saying there is no difference between rushdie and islam 
this is the community that is close to my heart rushdie 
told the news conference to come closer to it has given me a 
great deal of joy 
he said he would not permit any further translations of the book 
while any risk of further offense exists and added that he 
would continue to work for a better understanding of islam in the 
world as i have always attempted to do in the past 
no one was available for comment monday at viking penguin 
publishers the hardback book however the publisher had previously 
shown no enthusiasm for a paperback a position that had drawn 
criticism from rushdie 
if there was no paperback he said in an interview in january 
with the independent on sunday newspaper in a few years the book 
simply wont be there for anyone who wants to read it it will in 
all practical terms have been suppressed 
the satanic verses has sold more than 1 million copies in 
english almost threequarters of those in the united states and 
was on the sunday times of londons bestseller list for nearly a 
year it has been translated into 15 languages and banned in more 
than 20 countries 
rushdie born in bombay india and now a naturalized british 
citizen has been in hiding since feb 14 1989 his native country 
was the first to ban the book in october 1988 
in september 1989 a trade survey found booksellers in england 
divided on the question of stocking any paperback edition forty 
percent said they would not handle it 44 percent said they would 
according to publishing news

the state department on monday rejected 
charges by chinas communist party that the united states is using 
its human rights policy to subvert the chinese system of 
government 
responding to an editorial in the party organ peoples daily 
deputy spokesman richard boucher said the united states merely 
wants china to live up to internationally accepted human rights 
standards 
the harsh tone f the editorial contrasted sharply with the 
generally friendly reception given in beijing last week to richard 
schifter the assistant secretary for human rights 
boucher said needless to say we disagee with its the 
peoples dailys assessment of our human rights policy we 
dont seek to undermine the chinese government nor to interfere in 
its internal affairs 
rather he said the united states tries to point out to chinese 
authorities where they violate international human rights standards 
and to advise china of the likely consequences in terms of us 
policy 
boucher said the united states tries to persuade the chinese 
government to modify its practices to conform to international 
law 
the peoples daily editorial made sarcastic references to what 
it called the us guardians of human rights 
everyone can see clearly that human rights clamored for by 
these guardians have been used to suppress the masses interfere in 
others and protect the hegemony of rule by the bourgeoisie and 
dollar imperialists the editorial said 
after schifter left china last week a foreign ministry 
spokesman indicated a new openness to discuss rights issues 
schifter and us embassy officials said they detected a distinct 
thawing of chinese attitudes on such questions 
schifter submitted to chinese officials a list of 150 chinese 
prisoners believed held for political or religious activities and 
asked for a detailed description of their status 
schifter indicated that chinas softer attitude suggested they 
were anxious about the possibility congress might strip some trade 
benefits that china receives from the united states 
chinas economy has deteriorated and some analysts believe the 
country has become increasingly reliant on its trade with the 
united states which reportedly shows a 10 billion surplus in 
chinas favor 
us officials also have said that american support for chinese 
loan applications at international financial institutions is 
contingent on chinas human rights performance 
despite the evidence last week of a more flexible chinese 
attitude on human rights schifter said he would not recommend an 
easing of the remaining sanctions on china those sanctions were 
imposed after the massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators at 
tiananmen square 18 months ago 
among other sanctions the united states no longer permits large 
ceremonial visits by chinese and american delegations to each 
others capital

the pentagons top civilian and military 
officers brought president bush up to date on the tense situation 
in the persian gulf monday in a briefing at the presidents 
mountaintop retreat at camp david 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin l powell chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff returned to washington from a 
fiveday visit to saudi arabia on sunday and helicoptered monday to 
the camp about 60 miles north of the capital in western maryland 
neither the white house nor the defense department gave any 
details of their talks and cheney made no comments to reporters 
when he returned to the pentagon 
in saudi arabia cheney and powell met with senior commanders 
and some of the nearly 300000 american troops stationed in and 
around the desert kingdom 
the united nations has set a jan 15 deadline for iraq to 
withdraw from neighboring kuwait which the iraqis invaded on aug 
2 and later annexed 
cheney said during his mideast trip that the refusal of iraqi 
leader saddam hussein to withdraw as the deadline draws closer 
increases the likelihood of war 
each day that goes by each week without signs of an iraqi 
withdrawal moves us that much closer to the point at which we and 
other members of the coalition may have no other choice cheney 
said during a stopover sunday in cairo 
in the final days of their visit cheney and powell toughened 
their rhetoric against saddam apparently to counter statements 
made a us military official early in the trip that american 
ground forces might not be ready for comment until after the 
midjanuary deadline 
if i were saddam hussein i would take very seriously what the 
president said cheney said on the flight home that is that we 
are deploying the military capability to implement the un 
resolutions and to force him out of kuwait should that be 
necessary 
cheney also said during the visit in response to a sailors 
question that he was confident the allies that really count 
would not abandon the multinational military force if iraq withdrew 
only partly from kuwait he specifically mentioned the saudis 
egyptians and british 
on the flight home he said he was not trying to imply that 
syria and france were hedging their commitment to support their 
allies 
both cheney and powell said there was no timetable for attack by 
us forces which include marines stationed 50 miles from the 
iraqi border 
the defense secretary described the trip as enormously 
successful but gave no details of his meetings some of which 
even most of his top aides were not allowed to attend 
after his return from camp david cheney left for wyoming for a 
family vacation in his home state he is expected back in 
washington right after new years day

a homecooked meal a little gift a tour of the 
big city on christmas eve such simple gestures of good will 
captured not only holiday spirit but historic times 
eastern germans opened their doors to the soviet soldiers who 
once occupied the former nation the oncefeared red army paid a 
holiday visit bearing not arms but good tidings 
its hearttoheart contact people to people said klaus 
wuest the old regime was based on suspicion and hatred now we 
can be friendly 
wuest said he contacted the soviet command last week and asked 
if it would allow a soviet soldier to spend christmas eve with him 
his wife liane and their 5yearold son willi 
monday morning 19yearold nikolai showed up in uniform at the 
door of their home in bernau a small city just north of berlin 
nikolai from the ukraine city of lvov spoke only a little 
german the wuests spoke no russian yet they toured downtown 
berlin lingering a bit by a large memorial to the soviet soldiers 
who died while conquering nazi germany 
not too long ago neither of us could have come to this 
place said wuest a window washer 
the memorial a large statue of a helmeted soviet soldier 
stands in what used to be west berlin a short walk from where the 
berlin wall once kept wuest and his countrymen under soviet 
domination 
even though soviets lived in our city we had very little 
contact with them said wuest now we can see how hard it will 
be for these young men 
the family members said they were concerned about the unstable 
situation in the soviet union and they and nikolai did not want to 
reveal his last name 
even though his commander said it is ok to join the family 
he could have a new commander tomorrow who says its not wuest 
said 
this was one of several such meetings during the holidays two 
nationalities with a long tradition of animosity stopped and shared 
a moment as they hurtle in opposite directions 
eastern germans are experiencing tough times as they move to a 
radically different economic system but they face a brighter 
future as part of wealthy west germany 
soviet soldiers are preparing to return to a homeland also in 
turmoil unlike germany however the soviet unions very existence 
is uncertain 
earlier this month a german friendship society the german 
community urged eastern germans to invite soviet soldiers home for 
the holidays 
the society said late last week that it had received thousands 
of responses 
germany has been aggressive in collecting money and food to ship 
to the soviet union to help offset dire food distribution problems 
in the nation 
most of that aid has emanated from former west germany however 
many eastern germans still resent the fact that the soviet union 
imposed the communist system on their nation and kept 360000 
troops on their soil 
but good will does exist in eastern germany brandenburg state 
has sent gift packages of food to soviet bases news programs have 
shown young soldiers some looking a little embarrassed accepting 
them 
the images touched the members of the kiesov family they are 
expecting a soviet soldier christmas day 
our children are grown now and i saw these young men 18 19 
on television said siegfried kiesov 58 from the town of klein 
machnow outside berlin we had a lot of sympathy 
kiesov said he was alarmed by the overt hostility toward soviet 
soldiers after east germans threw off communism last year and began 
to freely express themselves 
the situation is hard there are a lot of people with nothing 
under the christmas tree he said but it is harder for these 
soldiers we can be optimistic about our future but i dont know 
if they can

the state supreme court on monday stripped 
a prosecutionsponsored crime initiative of its most ambitious 
provision a narrowing of many constitutional rights in criminal 
cases 
the court ruled unanimously that a portion of proposition 115 
approved by state voters last june made such a fundamental change 
in the structure of california government that it amounted to a 
revision of the state constitution which cannot be done by 
initiative 
the court upheld the rest of the measure on a 61 vote 
dubbed the speedy trial initiative by sponsors proposition 115 
contained numerous changes aimed at shortening court proceedings in 
criminal cases including restrictions on pretrial hearings 
continuances and questioning of prospective jurors it also 
requires defense lawyers to disclose evidence to prosecutors before 
trial 
one provision required state courts in criminal cases to follow 
us supreme court rulings in applying a long list of 
constitutional rights many of which have been interpreted by state 
courts as giving broader protection for defendants than federal 
rulings 
the court in an opinion by chief justice malcolm lucas 
declared the constitutional changes to be a revision rather 
than a valid constitutional amendment a revision can be submitted 
to voters only by the legislature or a constitutional convention 
california courts would lose power to interpret fundamental 
rights and ultimate protection of criminal defendants from 
deprivation of their constitutional rights would be left in the 
care of the united states supreme court lucas wrote 
the ruling keeps california at the forefront of the movement 
among state supreme courts across the country to give independent 
meaning to their state constitutions said gerald uelmen dean of 
the university of santa clara law school one of three lawyers who 
filed suit against proposition 115 
chief assistant attorney general richard iglehart whose office 
defended the measure said procedural changes remaining in the 
measure such as new time limits on hearings and trialsetting and 
the conduct of preliminary hearings are already quickening the 
pace of criminal cases around the state 
under proposition 115 preliminary hearings the 
sometimeslengthy sessions to determine whether a defendant should 
be held for trial are abbreviated the hearings are eliminated 
when a grand jury issues an indictment 
the measure also requires judges rather than lawyers to question 
prospective jurors requires pretrial disclosures of evidence by 
the defense formerly required only of the prosecutor requires 
defense lawyers to be prepared for trial in 60 days and makes it 
harder for the defense to get separate trials for multiple crimes 
the measure also allows 16yearolds convicted of capital murder 
to be sentenced to life without parole establishes penalties for a 
newly defined crime of torture and expands the death penalty

iranian officials and lebanese shiite 
moslem fundamentalists have said for months that western hostages 
would be freed before the years end but as the days dwindle so 
do hopes 
five hostages held by proiranian extremists were freed during 
the year but 13 remain in captivity and there is no indication 
they will be released by jan 1 
hopes that all hostages might be freed this year followed 
improvements in irans relations with the west following the death 
of revolutionary patriarch ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in june 
1989 
american educators robert polhill and frank reed were freed 10 
days apart in april swiss red cross workers emanuel christen and 
elio erriquez as well as irishman brian keenan were released in 
august 
that was a record for hostage releases in a single year since 
1983 when shiites launched their campaign of antiwestern 
kidnappings suicide bombings and aircraft hijackings 
many hoped there would be more releases to close the file of 
the hostages by the end of 1990 as many iranian and lebanese 
shiite officials have said 
but hussein musawi reputed mentor of hostageholding factions 
said us military intervention in the persian gulf following 
iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait hurt the chances for freedom for 
the six remaining american hostages 
musawi heads a prosyrian wing in hezbollah or the party of 
god irans main ally in lebanon and the umbrella organization of 
the shiite fanatical groups holding most of the westerners 
the longest held is american journalist terry anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press he was kidnapped 
on march 16 1985 
for anderson of lorain ohio and fellow american hostage 
thomas sutherland this christmas is their sixth in captivity 
it is the fifth for two other americans joseph cicippio and 
edward austin tracy and for british journalist john mccarthy 
anglican church envoy terry waite and american professors alann 
steen and jesse turner have spent four christmases in captivity 
american and british relatives and friends sent christmas 
greetings for publication in beirut newspapers hoping the captors 
would convey them to the hostages 
the messages included one from andersons sister peggy say and 
from his daughter sulome 5 whom he has never seen she was born 
four months after his abduction 
sulome on monday visited for the first time her fathers office 
at the ap bureau in beirut the office has been left as it was when 
anderson now 43 was kidnapped 
she sat on andersons desk and held his telephone his pictures 
in captivity hung on a board behind her 
i want to talk to daddy i want to kiss him sulome said 
andersons abduction has been claimed by islamic jihad or 
islamic holy war believed made up of proiranian shiite zealots 
the same group claims it holds sutherland 59 dean of agriculture 
at the american university of beirut who was kidnapped on june 9 
1985 
i dont really have any words left said sutherlands wife 
jean who has continued to live on the university campus i wish 
them all the merriest christmas and cant stop hoping they will be 
out this year 
waite 51 disappeared on jan 20 1987 after leaving a beirut 
hotel for a rendezvous with andersons and sutherlands captors no 
group has claimed it is holding him 
steen 51 and turner 43 were kidnapped four days later from 
the campus of the usaffiliated beirut university college a 
group calling itself islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine 
claimed responsibility 
cicippio 60 of valley forge pa was acting comptroller of 
the university when he was kidnapped on sept 12 1986 the 
revolutionary justice organization claimed responsibility for his 
seizure 
tracy 60 of burlington vt a writer was abducted on oct 
21 1986 and the same group that seized cicippio claimed 
responsibility 
mccarthy 34 a londonbased television journalist was kidnapped 
on april 17 1986 while driving to beirut airport to catch a 
flight for home no group has claimed responsibility 
recently freed hostages reed and keenan said mccarthy was held 
with them by shiite captors 
the other western hostages in lebanon are italian businessman 
alberto molinari 71 kidnapped on sept 11 1985 retired british 
pilot jack mann 76 and germans heinrich struebig 49 and thomas 
kemptner 29 
briton alec collett disappeared in 1985 a group that claimed to 
be holding him released a videotape purporting to show collett 
hanged but his death has never been confirmed

a judge ordered the federal government 
monday to pay more than 700000 to survivors of two pilots killed 
in a midair collision over a suburb in 1987 
survivors of the four pilots killed in the jan 15 1987 
collision two in each aircraft sued the federal government 
claiming negligence on the part of air traffic controllers at salt 
lake international airport the pilots were among 10 people killed 
in the accident 
us district judge thomas greene ruled that controllers were 51 
percent responsible for the crash and that the government should 
pay damages to the families of chester baker and paul lietz pilots 
of the smaller private plane 
controllers are federal employees 
greene awarded the baker family 387000 and the lietz family 
377000 the survivors of the skywest pilots settled with the 
government for an undisclosed amount in october 
in a 37page ruling greene said baker and lietz were partially 
responsible because they had entered restricted airspace moments 
before the crash 
the judge also concluded the controller in charge of a skywest 
metroliner which was on its final approach into the airport 
should have seen the smaller plane on the radar scope and alerted 
the metroliner 
the us attorneys office was closed monday and officials could 
not be reached for comment

el salvadors leftist rebel organization 
announced monday that at the urging of the united nations and the 
mexican government it had extended a holiday truce through jan 1 
earlier the rebel organization had said it would suspend 
operations only in san salvador on monday and tuesday and on dec 
31 and jan 1 
but a news release issued by the farabundo marti national 
liberation front or fmln said the guerrillas would suspend all 
attacks and economic sabotage in the country throughout the 
eightday period that began monday night 
the fmln said it was taking this step in response to proposals 
made by un secretary general javier perez de cuellar and 
the mexican government despite the hypocritical attitude 
adopted by el salvadors rightist government toward the holiday 
season 
it accused president alfredo cristianis administration of 
talking peace during the holidays while the army was invading 
guerrilla areas on one hand they talk about it and on the other 
they have undertaken great invasion operations in our territory 
the news release said 
about 800 soldiers from the salvadoran armys elite atlacatl 
infantry battalion are leading an operation against rebels holed up 
in the mountainous areas of northern chalatenango province 
the rebels had begun an offensive earlier this month after the 
latest of a series of peace talks with cristianis usbacked 
government became deadlocked 
the mexican government applauded the fmlns decision to extend 
the truce saying in a communique monday the foreign ministry 
congratulates the salvadoran insurgents for declaring a truce in 
the desired terms 
the bush administration accused the fmln of planning to 
intensify its offensive when the truce is over 
instead of negotiating to bring peace to el salvador in 1990 
the guerrillas have chosen to bring death and destruction to their 
country and its people state department spokesman richard 
boucher said in washington while professing to observe a truce 
they are preparing for more war 
five central american presidents concluded a threeday summit in 
costa rica last week with a statement condemning the fmln offensive 
and calling for an immediate ceasefire 
cristiani said last week that the guerrillas first truce 
offering fell far short of what people expected what the 
salvadoran people want and need are not two 2day truces but a 
definitive end to the war he said 
maria marta valladares a guerrilla commander also known as 
nidia diaz responded that the salvadoran government must treat the 
wars underlying problems of economic and social injustice before 
the rebels will put down their guns 
it does not make sense to call on us to abandon the armed 
struggle as long as the causes that gave rise to the armed struggle 
are not overcome she said 
the salvadoran government had no immediate comment on the latest 
truce announcment 
leaders of el salvador nicaragua honduras guatemala and 
costa rica are scheduled to meet with mexican president carlos 
salinas de gortari on jan 1011 to explore ways of achieving peace 
in central america through increased trade and economic 
development 
the foreign ministers of venezuela colombia and spain have been 
invited to attend the summit in the southern mexico city of tuxtla

albanias communist authorities on monday 
refused a request by the countrys first opposition party to 
postpone elections scheduled for february the state ata news 
agency reported 
the new democratic party of albania presented its request to the 
parliamentary presidium monday it was turned down on the grounds 
that the urgency of reforms required quick elections and the rapid 
formation of a parliament ata reported 
sihat tozaj secretary of the parliamentary presidium told a 
representative of the democratic party there was no objective 
reason to justify the postponing of elections ata reported in a 
dispatch monitored in vienna 
he rejected opposition claims the feb 10 election date left the 
new party insufficient time to organize against the powerful 
communists who have ruled unchallenged for 46 years 
the opposition sought to postpone the elections until april or 
may 
there are 40 days from today to february 10 tozaj was 
quoted as saying candidates are to be registered no later than 15 
days prior to the elections therefore the time at their disposal 
is enough he said 
the opposition had no immediate reaction to the refusal 
democratic party spokesman genc pollo reached by telephone in 
tirana said the party might have a statement tuesday 
under a new electoral law adopted last month which allows more 
than one candidate to compete for the 250 parliamentary seats 
candidates must collect at least 300 signatures from eligible 
voters in any voting district to run 
the democratic party was founded less than two weeks ago it 
faces numerous obstacles in making its program and candidates 
known 
the communists have used their power over official media to 
limit information on the new party meaning it must rely on word of 
mouth to propagate its cause in a backward nation with poor 
communications 
the party has announced plans to publish an opposition 
newspaper but it was unclear where it would get the equipment or 
funding for the project 
albanian president and communist party leader ramiz alia began 
introducing cautious reforms this year student protests over 
slumlike housing led two weeks ago to demands for democracy and 
helped force the ruling communists to permit the existence of other 
parties 
the balkan nation of 32 million is the last in europe to begin 
reforming hardline communist rule 
the greek government charged monday that albanian border guards 
had slain three ethnic greeks who tried to cross into greece 
government spokesman vyron polydoras in a statement in athens 
accused albania of extermination in the most revolting fashion 
the athens daily eleftheros typos claimed monday that albanian 
border guards shot and killed three ethnic greeks on dec 12 one 
of the victims was decapitated and the head paraded around a 
village the newspaper said 
the report couldnt be verified and it wasnt clear if the 
victims were the ones polydoras was talking about 
albanians have been trickling into greece over recent weeks 
including 100 over the weekend according to greek police ethnic 
greeks from albania are automatically granted asylum

under the watchful eye of 
israeli soldiers an unusually sparse crowd of worshipers 
celebrated christmas eve at the site of jesus birth 
a choir from jerusalem sang holiday carols in manger square 
under a light drizzle the festivities were subdued because of 
fears of violence raised by the 3yearold palestinian uprising and 
the persian gulf crisis 
german tourist gabriele beitz who came with her husband and 
11yearold daughter said the atmosphere in bethlehem was very 
very fearful 
we are very depressed about the place and about the whole 
political situation here she said for us christmas is an 
event of peace and here you cannot feel peace 
bethlehems palestinian town officials canceled christmas 
celebrations in solidarity with the uprising against israeli 
occupation uprising leaders had distributed leaflets prohibiting 
palestinians from celebrating publicly and ordering shops and 
restaurants to close for the day 
the town boasted few decorations 
the roman catholic patriarch of jerusalem michel sabah led a 
traditional procession to bethlehem before leading prayers at 
midnight mass in neighboring st catherines church 
sabah prayed for a peaceful resolution of the gulf conflict 
jesus shows u the way of love we need today on the eve of a 
world war especially under these circumstances we need peace 
he said in arabic and french 
our sins will be great if we are not brothers if our sons 
from both sides are brought up in hatred and violence we must 
build justice there must be a change 
about 2000 palestinians and european diplomats attended the 
midnight mass which opened a holiday season in the holy land 
featuring three celebrations of jesus birth the others are the 
greek orthodox christmas on jan 7 and the armenian orthodox 
celebration jan 19 
hundreds of soldiers and police guarded bethlehem as whiterobed 
priests earlier led sabah the first palestinian to head the roman 
catholic church in the holy land into the church of the nativity 
built over a grotto where tradition says jesus was born 
sabah wearing purple robes was greeted in manger square by the 
israeli military governor of bethlehem dudu mufaz the tradition 
dates to the 19th century when ottoman turks ruled palestine 
altar boys carrying candles then led sabah to pray in the grotto 
of jesus birth 
this year only one foreign choir performed in manger square on 
christmas eve that of the first united methodist church of 
oklahoma city 
the 19 singers wore green robes and sang gloria silent 
night and oh bethlehem as people in the crowd held lit 
candles 
nick harris senior pastor of the church said not all the group 
came on the trip because of menacing news from the middle east 
because of the gulf crisis and the uprising only a few dozen 
tourists wandered through manger square during the day though the 
crowd swelled to several hundred after nightfall 
in past years the square swarmed with people and was awash in 
colorful lights on monday most of the color was in the red purple 
and green berets of the israeli security forces standing guard 
around the square 
father wally anthony a catholic priest from flint mich now 
with the church in rome said of the scene sometimes when you 
read the scriptures you read about the soldiers there in the times 
of 2000 years ago and you can identify with that same kind of 
environment 
mayor elias freij a palestinian told reporters he was praying 
for peace on earth and good will toward all people and peace in 
the holy land between israelis and palestinians and peace amongst 
all the arabs 
freij blamed lack of tourists on a us state department 
advisory warning americans not to travel to the mideast or go to 
the occupied territories 
security was especially heavy because of a wave of arab attacks 
on israelis after the oct 8 temple mount riot in which israeli 
police killed 17 palestinians 
as a christmas gesture the military announced it was releasing 
217 palestinian prisoners most had less than a month to go in 
their sentences 
but curfews kept 15000 arabs inside their homes in three nearby 
refugee camps 
in the nearby hebron district soldiers fired on two arab 
suspects who resisted detention killing one and wounding another 
an army spokesman said 
the slain man not identified was suspected of killing an arab 
woman and shooting at israeli soldiers the spokesman said the 
national itim news agency said both men carried knives 
the death raised to 779 the number of arabs killed by israelis 
in the 3yearold uprising an additional 323 were slain by fellow 
arabs most as alleged collaborators with israel and 57 israelis 
also have died

prime minister omar karami formed a 
30man cabinet of prosyrian politicians and warlords monday to try 
to end lebanons civil war but its mission was imperiled by a 
rightwing christian boycott 
an official statement said president elias hrawi decreed the 
formation of the halfchristian halfmoslem government during a 
fivehour meeting with karami and parliament speaker hussein 
husseini 
the new cabinet includes seven militia chieftains as state 
ministers without portfolio an apparent effort to get their 
approval for a plan to disarm and disband all private armies in 
lebanon 
among them were druse warlord walid jumblatt whose progressive 
socialist party fielded the strongest moslem militia in the nearly 
16yearold civil war and his maronite catholic foe samir geagea 
jumblatt accepted his post apparently under syrian pressure 
despite earlier public criticism of hrawi for alleged corruption 
and favoritism 
but geageas lebanese forces the christians main militia said 
in a statement that geagea would not take up his cabinet post 
because the new government is heavily tilted toward syrianbacked 
leftists 
george saadeh also a maronite who heads the phalange party 
the nations largest rightwing political force rejected his post 
as minister of telecommunications on the same grounds a phalangist 
statement said 
the post of foreign minister in the new cabient went to hrwais 
soninlaw fares bweiz 
with jumblatt and geagea the other warlords in the cabinet were 
nabih berri head of the mainstream shiite moslem amal militia 
elie hobeika a maronite who heads a breakaway faction of geageas 
militia assaad hardan of the syrian social nationalist party 
suleiman franjieh of the prosyrian marada militia in north 
lebanon and abdulla alamin leader of the small alassad 
battalion named after syrian president hafez assad 
it was the first time that hardans nationalist party a 
leftist lebanese faction allied with syria has been brought into 
a lebanese government since lebanon gained independence from france 
in 1943 
the group advocates the merger of lebanon syria jordan 
preisrael palestine iraq kuwait and cyprus into a greater syria 
the rightist christian boycott cast doubt on the new 
governments ability to disband all militias 
geageas 6000strong heavily armed militia pulled out of 
beiruts christian districts last month to allow hrawis government 
to unite the capital and its environs in a militiafree greater 
beirut 
but geageas men are entrenched in the kesrouan and byblos 
provinces about 75 percent of lebanons christian hinterland 
north of beirut 
hezbollah or party of god irans main shiite fundamentalist 
ally in lebanon was excluded from the new cabinet 
hezbollah which controls one of lebanons three strongest 
militias had rejected the new government in advance saying it 
is certain to lack the vision and minimum degree of harmony 
required to resolve the nations woes 
karamis government succeeds that of outgoing prime minister 
salim hoss who resigned with his 14man cabinet on wednesday to 
make way for a broadbased government of national reconciliation 
karami said his cabinet would strive to bring about a lasting 
peace disarm all militias and launch a reconstruction campaign to 
shore up the countrys shattered economy 
we believe that all concerned will eventually join the 
government in order to achieve these national objectives said 
karami a sunni moslem

iraqi president saddam hussein reportedly threatened to make tel 
aviv his first target if war breaks out in the persian gulf and 
israel on monday promised swift and terrible retribution for any 
iraqi attack 
three weeks before the united nations deadline for iraq to 
withdraw its armies from kuwait or face a possible military strike 
the baghdad government recalled its ambassadors to the united 
states and some european nations for urgent consultations

television interview to be broadcast wednesday the journalist who 
spoke with the iraqi leader in baghdad on saturday said saddam told 
him tel aviv would receive the first blow in the case of a gulf 
war whether or not israel joined any multinational strike 
against iraq 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir responded to the reported 
threat by telling israel radio that iraq will be harmed in a most 
serious way if it attacks israel 
the new threat against israel appeared to be a fresh bid by 
saddam to divide the antiiraq coalition which includes some arab 
nations traditionally hostile to the jewish state 
a senior official of the palestine liberation organization 
israels most implacable enemy indicated in an interview published 
tuesday the plo would side with saddam if war broke out

council in qatar said it is braver to opt for peace than for 
war

reconciliation if he left kuwait urging that saddam know that 
the curtain is not yet drawn on the scorching war and that he 
can spare himself and his people its horror

the pentagons top civilian and military 
officers brought president bush up to date on the tense situation 
in the persian gulf monday in a briefing at the presidents 
mountaintop retreat at camp david 
defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin l powell chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff returned to washington from a 
fiveday visit to saudi arabia on sunday and helicoptered monday to 
the camp about 60 miles north of the capital in western maryland 
neither the white house nor the defense department gave any 
details of their talks and cheney made no comments to reporters 
when he returned to the pentagon 
however abctv said monday night and the new york times said 
in tuesday editions that bush was told senior officers shared the 
view of lt gen calvin waller deputy us commander in saudi 
arabia that it would be late february before the troops would be 
ready to attack iraqi forces 
in saudi arabia cheney and powell met with senior commanders 
and some of the nearly 300000 american troops stationed in and 
around the desert kingdom 
the united nations has set a jan 15 deadline for iraq to 
withdraw from neighboring kuwait which the iraqis invaded on aug 
2 and later annexed 
cheney said during his mideast trip that the refusal of iraqi 
leader saddam hussein to withdraw as the deadline draws closer 
increases the likelihood of war 
each day that goes by each week without signs of an iraqi 
withdrawal moves us that much closer to the point at which we and 
other members of the coalition may have no other choice cheney 
said during a stopover sunday in cairo 
in the final days of their visit cheney and powell toughened 
their rhetoric against saddam apparently to counter statements 
made a us military official early in the trip that american 
ground forces might not be ready for comment until after the 
midjanuary deadline 
if i were saddam hussein i would take very seriously what the 
president said cheney said on the flight home that is that we 
are deploying the military capability to implement the un 
resolutions and to force him out of kuwait should that be 
necessary 
cheney also said during the visit in response to a sailors 
question that he was confident the allies that really count 
would not abandon the multinational military force if iraq withdrew 
only partly from kuwait he specifically mentioned the saudis 
egyptians and british 
on the flight home he said he was not trying to imply that 
syria and france were hedging their commitment to support their 
allies 
both cheney and powell said there was no timetable for attack by 
us forces which include marines stationed 50 miles from the 
iraqi border 
the defense secretary described the trip as enormously 
successful but gave no details of his meetings some of which 
even most of his top aides were not allowed to attend 
after his return from camp david cheney left for wyoming for a 
family vacation in his home state he is expected back in 
washington right after new years day

a summary of developments in the news industry for the week of 
dec 1723 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the philadelphia inquirer apologized 
publicly for an editorial that had been attacked as racist because 
it linked a new contraceptive to efforts to reverse poverty 
the apology was contained in an editorial in the newspapers 
dec 23 edition 
the newspaper took the unusual step in response to criticism of 
a dec 12 editorial that suggested the contraceptive norplant 
recently approved by the federal government could help solve the 
problem of poverty among blacks 
the earlier norplant editorial undercut our credibility and 
our efforts to be a thoughtful responsible and compassionate voice 
on the complex issues of poverty the newspaper said we 
apologize to those we hurt and offended 
the apology said the newspapers own reporters editors and 
editorial board members were among those incensed by the original 
editorial it was printed alongside five letters to the editor 
containing both praise and criticism 
the original editorial discussed two stories in the previous 
days newspaper one was about norplant which prevents pregnancy 
through implants of tiny rods under the skin and stays effective 
for years and the other was about a research finding that nearly 
half of black children live in poverty and the situation is growing 
worse 
 
here is the text of the editorial headlined an apology and 
subtitled the editorial on norplant and poverty was misguided 
and wrongheaded 
 
its rare that we regret publishing an editorial from almost the 
moment it appears in print and its rarer still that we feel the 
need to apologize to our readers for a misguided and wrongheaded 
editorial opinion but such is the case with the editorial that 
appeared in this space on dec 12 entitled norplant and 
poverty great pain anger and controversy have resulted from 
that editorial and we deeply regret our decision to print it 
among the people who were incensed by the editorial were many of 
the inquirers own reporters editors and members of the editorial 
board in the days since it appeared we have been doing a lot of 
listening and soulsearching 
we realize now that we hastily and foolishly juxtaposed two news 
items that appeared in the inquirer the previous day federal 
approval of the longterm contraceptive norplant and the release of 
a research groups report that said nearly half of black children 
are living in poverty and that the situation is getting worse with 
time the editorial posed the question of whether encouraging women 
who are on welfare to use norplant could help reverse this bleak 
trend 
where did we go wrong lets begin with the headline which 
asked whether contraception could reduce the underclass and 
thus aroused peoples fears of something far worse than promoting 
birth control later we used the word eugenics as a way of 
explaining what we didnt mean but it only inflamed matters more 
most fundamentally in linking the issues of race and 
contraception we left too many people with the impression that our 
cure for poverty was to reduce the number of black people although 
that certainly was not what we meant to suggest the fact that so 
many people interpreted it that way is a clear indication that the 
editorial was fatally flawed therefore we failed in our effort to 
provoke thoughtful discussion on the issue of birth control and 
poverty 
its true that many single young women lessen their chances of 
escaping poverty by having children too early in life but itsalso true 
that the very hopelessness of their circumstances often 
underlies the decision not to postpone childbearing creating hope 
where none now exists must be the main tenet of any effective war 
on poverty 
in the previous editorial we said that women on welfare should 
be encouraged but not compelled to use norplant we suggested 
incentives such as an additional benefit of some kind our critics 
countered that to dangle cash or some other benefit in front of a 
desperately poor woman is tantamount to coercion theyre right 
we still believe that this new form of reliable birth control 
which is likely to have wide appeal to middleclass women should 
be equally available to poor women who want to use it but we also 
realize and should have been even clearer about it that this 
has to be a matter of personal choice we dont seek to limit the 
options of poor women but to empower them 
we remain committed to a whole host of strategies for reducing 
poverty from better schools to job training to radical welfare 
reform we think education about birth control is important and if 
norplant lives up to its advance billing it could be helpful to 
many women 
and we wish we had said it that way to begin with the earlier 
norplant editorial undercut our credibility and our efforts to be a 
thoughtful responsible and compassionate voice on the complex 
issues of poverty we apologize to those we hurt and offended

citing declines in advertising the boston globe 
announced it will reduce its work force by 100 fulltime positions 
through attrition over the next five years 
the 100 positions represent about 5 percent of the fulltime 
staff at the globe which employs 2075 fulltime and 500 parttime 
workers 
we are experiencing the same economic forces affecting other 
companies said william o taylor publisher of the globe and 
chairman of the newspapers parent company affiliated publications 
inc 
advertising is down significantly this year and the outlook 
is cautious at best he said we think this is the least 
painful way to address the need to be as costeffective as we can 
for the future 
the attrition program is another step in an overall costcutting 
effort at the globe which began with budget cuts in the spring of 
1988 it has also included reductions in department expenditures 
and in hours of some parttime staff 
taylor earlier said he expected earnings to be down 
significantly at affiliated publications and that the company 
planned to raise the price of the globe from 35 cents to 50 cents 
in april in areas 30 miles outside the city

financial news network and united press international said dec 22 
that it could not repay a 207 million loan that was called in 
early 
the lenders security pacific national bank and midlantic 
national bank now have the right to foreclose on infotechnologys 
46 percent stock interest in fnn a cable television network 
the fnn stock was placed as collateral for the loan which 
originally was due next july the banks did not say why they called 
in the loan early and would not say whether they would exercise 
their foreclosure option 
an infotechnology spokeswoman said the company did not believe 
the banks would foreclose on the loan and it would continue seeking 
buyers for its media subsidiaries to raise cash 
the development was the latest blow to infotechnology whose fnn 
subsidiary reported on dec 18 that it lost 725 million in its 
1990 fiscal year upi a news wire service reportedly has been 
losing as much as 25 million a month 
last month upi union and management employees agreed to a 35 
percent pay cut for 90 days to give the news service time to find a 
buyer upi has changed ownership three times in eight years 
fnn provides stock quotes business and financial news and 
sports information on a cable tv network to more than 35 million 
homes served by 3500 in the united states and canada 
fnn said its loss stemmed primarily from accounting changes 
totaling 65 million fnn said said the changes regarded improperly 
documented lease transactions new product development costs and 
payments to upi 
fnn said it was in the process of revising its quarterly reports 
for the first three quarters of 1990 to reflect a review conducted 
by fnn and its new accountants coopers amp lybrand 
in october fnn dismissed c steven bolen chief financial 
officer for improper financial dealings 
the fnn financial report said an investigation concluded bolen 
had payments made to himself totaling 794061 that were not 
properly authorized and not properly identified on fnns books 
through his counsel mr bolen claimed that such payments were 
earned by him as incentive compensation for arranging financing for 
the company the filing stated 
fnn said it was considering suing bolen to recover the money

after settling a shareholder suit 
with texas billionaire robert m bass and others the times 
publishing co has emerged with 81 million cash and a healthy 
balance sheet newly disclosed documents show 
the settlement reached in august specified that neither side 
would reveal any details but times publishing released some 
information dec 18 to satisfy requests from the state of florida 
the disclosure gave several details about the privately held 
company that publishes the st petersburg times but the amount the 
company paid bass to drop his suit was not reported 
under the terms of the settlement times publishing agreed to 
buy back a 40percent stake owned by the bass group the group had 
purchased the stake in august 1988 for about 28 million and had 
offered to buy the rest of the company for 270 million earlier 
this year 
the documents released dec 18 show total bank debt for the 
newspaper company as of nov 30 was 9 million 
the company is strong and vital and we can go on to other 
things chief executive and editor andrew barnes said 
according to treasurer catherine heron the companys cash 
position would cover the majority of existing bank debt 
the 9 million debt will be paid off by 1995 she said 
the documents were released to the florida attorney generals 
office which was concerned that the shareholder settlement could 
adversely affect the poynter institute for media studies in st 
petersburg 
the institute is the chief shareholder of times publishing 
after acquiring its stake the bass partnership had sued times 
publishing over dividend payments the bulk of which support the 
institutes educational programs 
under the settlement times publishing agreed to buy back the 
bass stake and redeem an issue of nonvoting stock which paid 
healthy dividends to the institute 
at the time of the settlement the company claimed the agreement 
would not hurt the institute it said the preferred shares held by 
the institute would be replaced by debt which would pay more in 
annual interest than the preferred stock once paid in dividends 
the company said the institute also could expect to receive 
dividends from the common stock it holds 
the latest disclosures show the institute eventually will own 
all of the times publishing common stock 
robert lanzillotti dean emeritus of the university of floridas 
graduate business school was hired by the institute to 
independently review the bass settlement 
he said it will make possible substantially greater financial 
support for the institutes operations and growth over the long 
run 
in addition to the st petersburg newspaper one of the largest 
and most prominent in the south times publishing runs 
congressional quarterly florida trend and georgia trend magazines

the daily news accused its striking unions of 
violating federal labor law by using a campaign of violence 
against the newspapers dealers and advertisers 
the allegations were contained in a lawsuit filed dec 17 the 
second filed by the news against the unions in us district court 
in manhattan since the strike began oct 25 
the first lawsuit was brought under the civil racketeering 
statute and accused the nine striking unions of coordinating a 
violent conspiracy to force a favorable labor settlement or the 
sale of the newspaper 
the new complaint claims the unions violated the 
labormanagement relations act which prohibits unions from 
interfering with the business of parties not involved in a labor 
dispute 
the defendants and agents acting on their behalf have mounted 
a campaign of violence and intimidation against the news dealers 
and advertisers in an effort to disrupt the publication and sale of 
the newspaper the lawsuit said 
the lawsuit asks for more than 50 million in losses that the 
news claims it incurred as a result of the campaign which it said 
included many hundreds of incidents of arson assault 
vandalism threats and harassment 
theodore kheel a labor attorney and adviser to the unions 
denied the allegations he cited recent testimony by senior police 
officials who said investigations found the violence was committed 
by individuals and was not part of a coordinated conspiracy 
kheel said the news lawsuits against the unions constituted 
harassment 
the news has published every day during the strike but the 
majority of the citys 12000 newsstands and vendors have stopped 
selling the paper and major advertisers have pulled their accounts 
before the strike it was the nations thirdlargest 
metropolitan daily with circulation of 109 million circulation 
has dropped to about 600000

national is planning to boost its cover price by a quarter to 75 
cents on jan 21 
in addition the sports newspaper said dec 21 that it would 
test a 1 daily price for one or two of its 10 metropolitan 
editions specific editions have not yet been selected for the 
test spokesman stephen hammond said 
the move comes as the 11monthold newspaper is trying to prove 
there are enough readers to sustain the first allsports daily in 
the united states it also comes when the weakest advertising 
market in 15 years is driving newspapers to find alternate methods 
of generating more revenue 
two weeks ago the national told advertisers it was reducing its 
circulation guarantee by 27 percent to 200000 copies the 
admission that it was not making its guaranteed average of 275000 
followed a review that resulted in elimination of its sunday 
edition the dismissal of the circulation manager and two other top 
executives and layoffs of 18 other employees 
the paper is now publishing five times a week monday through 
friday 
the national has editions in new york chicago los angeles san

businesses will have up to four years 
instead of two to provide safer equipment and working conditions 
for video display terminal users under a compromise mayor art agnos 
has agreed to sign his aides say 
what was hailed as the nations toughest vdt law won final 
approval from the city board of supervisors on dec 17 but agnos 
wouldnt commit to signing it until he talked to business and labor 
groups about its impact and cost 
after a weekend meeting with agnos the two sides agreed dec 22 
to several amendments one of which would extend the compliance 
period from two years to as many as four years the mayors aides 
said 
the compromise which agnos plans to sign dec 27 must go back 
to the supervisors for approval 
this is an example of what happens when both sides come to the 
table and we now have something that both sides can live with 
said claude everhart deputy mayor for government operations who 
mediated the negotiations 
the compromise measure still calls for frequent work breaks 
proper lighting antiglare screens adjustable computer furniture 
and equipment to make vdt use safer 
among the problems associated with regular work at a computer 
keyboard are nerve damage to the wrists and fingers back and neck 
strain eye strain sleep disturbances chronic headaches nausea 
and fatigue 
labor leaders hope the vdt law will be a model for other cities 
and counties in california and for the state and other states 
nationwide 
business groups have consistently opposed efforts to pass such 
legislation because of its expense and because some doubt vdt use 
causes health problems 
city budget analysts estimate businesses will spend as much as 
765 million and the city as much as 6 million to comply with the 
law

the parent company of the dallas times herald 
asked a state appeals court dec 19 to order a new trial of its 
antitrust lawsuit against the dallas morning news 
the dispute grew out of a deal in which the times herald lost 26 
features and comics including doonesbury and dear abby to its 
larger rival the times herald printing co unsuccessfully sued the 
morning news and its parent company ah belo corp for 33 
million 
the times herald claims in its appeal that state district judge 
david west erred when he told the jury to ignore potentially 
anticompetitive behavior by the morning news if it could be shown 
that the morning news also was pursuing a legitimate business goal 
the appeal also says west should have granted the times heralds 
motion for a new trial 
michael j mccarthy belo senior vice presidentsecretary and 
general counsel said he thought the judge acted correctly 
in the lawsuit the times herald accused the morning news and 
belo of violating state antitrust laws in a transaction reached 
with universal press syndicate in august 1989 
the lawsuit accused the times heralds larger rival of trying to 
force it out of business through the deal with universal which 
stripped the times herald of the features and comics 
during the trial belo and the morning news said the main reason 
for their deal with universal was to create a joint venture to 
develop television programming based on universal comics and 
features 
belo attorneys argued it made no sense for the joint venture to 
promote features appearing in a competing paper 
belo and the morning news have 25 days to respond to the appeal 
oral arguments could be held as early as june with no final 
decision likely before next december

this wont be a problem said terry savage who writes a

times herald and who appears regularly on chicago station wbbm 
savage 46 the first woman named to the companys board in 20 
years will receive 24000 a year from mcdonalds plus 2000 for 
each board meeting attended 
officials at the newspapers and tv station said savage promised 
to stay away from any issues that could be construed as conflicting 
with her role on the mcdonalds board 
we will make sure she does not write about the food industry 
and mcdonalds in particular said jim frisinger times herald 
business editor 
but george harmon who teaches business writing at northwestern 
universitys graduate school of journalism said it would be hard 
to avoid the apperance of a conflict because mcdonalds influences 
so much of the business world 
he said savage could be restricted from reporting on the beef 
potato and recycling industries and even the stock market because 
mcdonalds is among the 30 companies whose performances are 
reflected in the dow jones industrials average 
if somebody wanted to restrict terry from reporting on 
mcdonalds and be very strict about that it would restrain her 
considerably he said

arizona republic investigative reporter former plumber james 
robison was charged again in 1989 
john harvey adamson who was the prosecutions chief witness at 
the 1977 trial and then refused to testify after the convictions 
were overturned has been offered a deal and will take the stand 
once more attorney general bob corbin said 
corbin said this time he has a stronger case but he wouldnt 
say what evidence he has or why adamson whom he once derided as no 
longer a credible witness was working with authorities again 
but a criminal complaint filed dec 19 also accuses dunlap and 
robison this time of conspiring with others to obstruct justice and 
influence witnesses in the original case 
according to the complaint dunlap and robison were overheard 
talking about payments made to robison and adamson to keep them 
quiet over the last 14 years 
bolles died in 1976 11 days after a radiocontrolled bomb 
ripped through his car as he backed out of a hotel parking lot 
adamson testified that he planted the bomb under bolles car and 
robison triggered it on orders from dunlap he said dunlap wanted 
to ingratiate himself with land and liquor magnate kemper marley 
who had been the target of several critical stories by bolles 
marley died earlier this year 
bolles had won acclaim for his exposes on land fraud dog racing 
and organized crime 
robison and dunlap were convicted of murder and sentenced to 
death but the state supreme court reversed the convictions in 
1980 saying the defense had been unfairly prevented from asking 
adamson certain questions 
adamson a greyhound breeder and towtruck operator was 
originally allowed to plead guilty to lesser charges and sentenced 
to 20 years in prison in exchange for his testimony after the 
convictions were thrown out he refused to testify again unless 
authorities paid for his childrens education 
corbin said that destroyed adamsons credibility and he was 
then charged with murder he was convicted and is serving life in 
prison 
in exchange for his testimony this time his sentence will be 
reduced to a maximum of 20 years

about unpublished details of her interview with arnold during 
which he showed no remorse for the killing 
but in testimony during the penalty phase of the trial after he 
was found guilty arnold himself said that he had no remorse or

death he told the jury

the philadelphia inquirer asked a judge dec 
17 to dismiss a 6 million libel verdict a state supreme court 
justice won after the paper allegedly defamed him 
the verdict was against the evidence and improper contrary 
to law and fact according to a motion for a new trial by 
philadelphia newspapers inc which owns the inquirer 
attorney william hangley filed the motion which went to common 
pleas judge john lavelle of carbon county there was no indication 
when lavelle would rule or set a hearing 
inquirer reporter daniel biddle wrote a 1983 series of articles 
that questioned the ethical conduct of members of the states 
highest court 
justice james t mcdermott filed two lawsuits against the 
newspaper one for the original series and one for the reprint 
which went to the 1984 conference of the american judicature 
society 
the jury decided on dec 7 that biddles original series was not 
libelous but that portions of a february 1984 reprint were false 
the reprint contained the same text as the original series but was 
accompanied by an introduction two editorials and two cartoons 
that had not appeared with the original series 
there was no evidence that anyone at the ajs meeting actually 
read the articles in reprint form at the seminar or anywhere 
else hangley said in the motion 
hangley argued a new trial was warranted because the award of 
compensatory and punitive damages is so excessive as to shock the 
conscience 
the jurys verdicts were inconsistent and irreconcilable 
the motion said the court should correct and set aside such a 
verdict 
the ruling was the second libel judgment against the paper in a 
year in may an attorney won a record 34 million finding against 
the paper for a 1973 story criticizing his handling of a homicide 
case while he was assistant district attorney the paper is 
appealing that ruling as well

an appeals court has dismissed a libel case 
against san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen saying his 
item about a deputy sheriffs arrest on violence and drug charges 
was not libelous because it was true 
the state court of appeal on dec 18 dismissed the libel suit by 
former san francisco sheriffs deputy robert heimbaugh 
caen wrote in january 1987 that heimbaugh had been booked at 
city jail on charges of brandishing a gun beating his livein lady 
friend and possessing drug paraphernalia the district attorneys 
office wants to prosecute but is in a quandary because the 
allegedly battered nonbride will not testify against him heimbaugh 
is out on bail and on medical leave 
the appeals court said the deputy had indeed been arrested 10 
days before the column appeared on charges of corporal punishment 
of a cohabitant brandishing a weapon and possession of narcotics 
paraphernalia 
therefore the lawsuit was without merit the court ruled the 
charges against heimbaugh were later dropped 
caen has written a daily shortitem column featuring gossip 
jokes and tales about san francisco and its people for 52 years in 
a footnote the court characterized caen as the journalistic 
equivalent of the golden gate bridge 
heimbaugh did not dispute the facts in the item but argued that 
the column was untrue because the charges were later dropped and 
his bail was canceled the court ruled that those developments did 
not make the published item libelous 
heimbaugh resigned from the sheriffs department and works as a 
cab driver and bartender in san francisco he also has worked as a 
legal researcher 
he said that although he had not yet seen the courts opinion he 
intended to appeal

a judge who ordered a dozen people found 
guilty of drunken driving shoplifting and other misdemeanors to 
advertise their crimes changed his mind when the pensacola news 
journal refused to go along 
county judge william white ordered the offenders to buy space to 
publish their pictures charges and sentences 
the newspaper as a matter of policy does not wish to become a 
vehicle for courtordered public humiliation publisher kenneth 
andrews said dec 19 
the advertising columns of the newspaper are open for free and 
voluntary expression within reasonable bounds of propriety and if 
the ads ordered by judge white are accepted other courts may 
consider involuntary newspaper advertising as a potential method of 
punishing defendants 
the court order called for an ad at least one column wide and 2 
inches tall white said he considered the measure harsh but said 
it would help deter the holiday season rise in drunken driving 
theft and the spread of aids

a television interview with a man whose wife 
has been missing since dec 8 was seized by police who got a search 
warrant to obtain the tape from ktwotv managing editor charles 
brown said 
the womans husband had complained in the interview that police 
were spending too much time treating him like a suspect when they 
should be searching for his wife 
on dec 18 police seized the taped interview saying it 
constitutes evidence 
brown said the station decided not to challenge the warrant in 
part because the husband had approached ktwo on his own 
additionally station officials didnt think the interview 
contained any comments that the man hadnt already made to police 
he said 
our position was we take this on a casebybase basis brown 
said i think it just ought to be on a casebycase basis i 
dont think you should turn stuff over voluntarily but responding 
to a search warrant is different 
according to an affidavit that accompanied the warrant police 
wanted the tape because it contained statements made by the husband 
that they believe show he concealed a stolen gun and military 
equipment found when officers searched the couples house after she 
disappeared 
michael krampner a lawyer working with the wyoming press 
association said ktwo already had broadcast a portion of the 
interview and so there was little argument for confidentiality of 
the tape 
as the law now is in wyoming journalists are no different 
from any other citizens he said if they receive a subpoena to 
come to court and tell what they know theyre just like any other 
citizen they have the obligation to respond to that if a court 
issues a valid search warrant obviously they have to stand 
aside and let them search for it just like any other citizens

gov michael s dukakis on dec 17 signed 
into law a bill to reduce the secrecy of the states criminal 
records ending a threeyear struggle to overhaul the criminal 
offender records information law 
the revised law is a compromise between those who wanted the 
records opened completely and those who wanted the secrecy 
maintained it will keep records open from one to three years 
depending on the crime and prison sentence 
as passed in 1972 the law kept virtually all criminal records 
secret 
the drive to change it began in the wake of the willie horton 
case that became a major issue in the presidential campaign between 
dukakis and george bush 
the records law was little known to the public until horton a 
convicted firstdegree murderer from lawrence escaped from his 
10th prison furlough and went on to rape a young maryland woman and 
stab her fiance repeatedly in march 1987 
citing the law state correction officials refused to say why 
they gave horton weekend passes after he had been sentenced to life 
in prison without parole for the slaying of a teenager 
hortons records were released only after the lawrence

for the better ipi director peter galliner wrote in the report

spying 
iraqs invasion of kuwait silenced about 40 kuwaiti

der spiegel did a 13page cover story on 
allegations that one of its reporters was a spy for communist east 
germany 
the allegations concerning diethelm schroeder surfaced in a 
television expose and spiegel did its own story in the dec 17 
issue 
the hamburgbased newsweekly left schroeders name on te roster 
of its berlin bureau but noted he was on leave 
spiegel showed the drubbing it took from other german 
publications a headline in the masscirculation daily bild asked 
if schroeder was a traitor a cartoon republished from the 
rheinische post showed a spiegel sleuth following a spys tracks 
in a circle that became spiegels own trail 
i have to live with this story schroeder said in a 
telephone interview denying he had worked for the east german 
secret service or done anybody any harm 
the 60yearold native of eastern germany a military specialist 
who worked in the associated press germanlanguage service for 
five years in the sixties said his spiegel colleagues had 
explained that they had done major stories on other spy allegations 
and now we have to write a story about you 
i think its correct schroeder said adding with a laugh 
i would have had more fun if it was another story i think 
ard television named schroeder as having worked from 1964 to 
1987 for the stasi as the nowdefunct east germanys ministry for 
state security is called 
prosecutors confirmed that schroeder was under investigation 
though there was no word on how serious a case he might face 
conviction for passing state secrets can bring life in prison 
while a lesser charge of passing information to a foreign espionage 
agency carries a maximum 10year prison term 
as germany works to clear up the decades of crossborder spying 
prosecutors have already issued 61 arrest warrants this year 
spiegel which grew up with postwar west germany has been 
hitting the espionage issue hard along with other issues facing 
newly united germany 
only a week earlier spiegel had a scoop revealing evidence that 
east germanys first and only noncommunist prime minister lothar 
de maiziere had a stasi past de maiziere denies cooperating with 
secret police but quit as deputy head of the governing christian

at success magazine an editors mistakes are 
costly 25 for a mispelling er misspelling another 25 for 
poorlyplaced hyphens a whopping 500 for getting somebodys name 
wrong 
for the past two months sloppy copy has meant surrendering cold 
cash at success gleefully plundering inattentive editors is editor 
in chief scott degarmo who says he grew tired of making the same 
complaints to the same people about the same errors 
when my people see a typo anyplace i want them to step on it 
like a roach degarmo said dec 19 
but taking money for mistakes isnt that a little extreme 
no if you asked the average guy on the street he would say 
of course an editor should know how to spell degarmo said if 
a bricklayer made a crooked wall or an accountant couldnt add 
people would be angry but editors think its nothing to not know 
how to spell 
the walletlightening approach to achieving good grammar began 
nov 5 at the monthly magazine when degarmo fired off a memo to 
his six senior editors errors would no longer be tolerated fines 
would be levied 
degarmo in the course of his job would check all copy handed 
in by his senior editors if he caught any grammatical or 
typographical errors the person responsible would pay 25 for 
spelling mistakes the same for hyphens after words ending in ly 
highlysought for example 
the fines would come from the money budgeted for their raises 
the editors they were appalled and astounded degarmo 
recalled but all the socalled positive reinforcement hadnt 
worked 
how serious was degarmo ask senior editor michael maren who 
had a 600 lesson in how to spell epitaph guerrilla and 
prestigious among other words 
after watching degarmo take a big bite of his money maren was 
apologetic 
we probably didnt check things as carefully as we should 
have he told the wall street journal 
degarmos approach has paid off in more than one way in 
addition to collecting 625 he has not seen a glitch in copy since 
nov 29 
its not enough to ask people to do their best degarmo 
said youve got to tell them what you want in my case it was 
perfection

pink slips go out next month for about 1000 
employees of the canadian broadcasting corp the governmentowned 
network many see as the glue that holds together this vast and 
diverse nation of 26 million people 
the bad news comes from budgetcutters who are slashing 10 
percent of the corporations staff closing television stations and 
reducing services 
their goal is to make up a projected shortfall of 91 million in 
next years 935 million budget 
declining advertising revenues reduced government funding and 
rising tv production costs have hurt the network deeply about 75 
percent of production costs comes from the government 
angry public protests have occurred from newfoundland to ontario 
to the gaspe peninsula of quebec over what many feel are cuts in 
one of the few things that make canadians really different from 
americans 
the cbc will cut 1100 of its nearly 11000 permanent positions 
effective april 5 
in announcing the cutbacks and closures dec 5 cbc president 
gerard veilleux said they were permanent and would not be reversed 
even if there is a turn in the 54yearold corporations economic 
fortunes 
a major element in the costsaving program was closure of three 
television stations entirely and reducing eight others to small 
news reporting bureaus feeding their reports into regional and 
national centers 
the cbc also announced it no longer will operate the 
parliamentary channel which broadcasts debate in the house of 
commons or radio canada international the shortwave service that 
broadcasts in 14 languages abroad 
iqbal rahemtulla a spokesman for the corporation said the 
house of commons may take over the funding of the parliamentary 
broadcast and the ministry of external affairs because of 
international ramifications is considering ways to maintain radio 
canada internationals services 
if all that wasnt bad enough the cbcs projections show that 
there will be another shortfall of about 42 million in the 199293 
budget 
emerging relatively unscathed except for a 1 percent budget 
reduction is cbc radio broadcasting in both french and english to 
every canadian in this gigantic country 
the radio which carries no advertising features news current 
events talk shows and music to a wide range of audiences on both 
am and fm its northern service also broadcasts in english french

equipment company at a cost of about 1300 and then enter a 
contract with cnn to unscramble the feed 
although cnn does not now contract with individuals spokeswoman 
kitsy riggall said the company would certainly work with anybody

public television station kcet reversed 
itself dec 18 and decided to renew south africa now after a 
conservative media group that fought the show filed papers 
challenging the stations license 
the stations decision came one day after the committee on media 
integrity asked the federal communications commission to deny 
renewal of kcets license and a request for a new transmitter 
group spokesman david horowitz offered to withdraw the challenge 
if the station established an elected board of directors and hired 
an ombudsman 
kcet president william kobin called the demands preposterous and 
part of a longstanding effort to control the station 
south africa now which covers issues in that country from a 
black perspective was canceled in october after kcet judged it did 
not meet journalistic standards for objectivity 
the program is scheduled for sundays at 9 am the station said 
it will run with a disclaimer identifying it as a point of view

a fredonia ny radio station owner accused 
of discriminatory hiring and of holding a contest in which he kept 
the prize lost a bid dec 20 to renew his license 
the federal communications commission decided in march 1989 not 
to renew catoctin broadcasting corps license for the 250watt 
station wbuzam owner henry serafin appealed the decision to the 
us circuit court of appeals for the district of columbia 
we defer to the commissions expertise and judgment a 
threejudge panel of the court wrote 
this was the first time in a decade that the fcc had pulled a 
license on character grounds only about 100 stations have lost 
their licenses since the fcc was founded in 1934 
serafin who learned of the decision from the associated press 
said he did not know what he would do next 
im in shock right now he said from the station about 30 
miles south of buffalo i have to take a day or two to think this 
thing out 
in 1981 catoctins application to renew its license was 
challenged by the chautauqua county rural ministry inc the 
dunkirk ny chapter of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people and the local branch of the league 
of women voters 
among the charges against serafin was that he had discriminated 
against a black job applicant in 1980 
in running a contest at the station in 1982 serafin also 
allegedly kept the grand prize a stereo system for himself and 
gave another prize a trip to niagara falls to a favored 
advertiser 
in addition serafin repeatedly refused to make catoctins 
public file available to citizens the file contains a stations 
filings with the fcc and citizen complaints

miami herald executive editor janet chusmir who 
traded a housewifes apron for a climb to journalisms heights 
reached by few women of her generation died dec 22 of a brain 
aneurism she was 60 
we have lost a great friend and a great editor said 
publisher david lawrence what zest she had for good newspapers

marychapin carpenter writes true stories 
her characters are single women like herself theyre breaking 
up with a boyfriend or maybe just thinking about one from long ago 
they like to dance and they like quiet moments just talking on the 
phone with a close friend 
she named her second album state of the heart and the songs 
lived up to it a roulette wheel of emotions from lust to regret 
shooting straight in the dark is her new record but carpenter 
thinks human behavior might have worked better as a title 
a lot of the tunes are about human behavior kneejerk 
reactions to certain things carpenter said during an interview 
many are about me not so much about me but about feelings that i 
have and observations in people i know 
if id actually have to choose id have to say i like 
nonfiction more than fiction she said i like biographies 
im a history buff ive never been able to get into science 
fiction or fantasy i like things that are real 
carpenter tells of women frightened by love and frightened of 
being alone sometimes they get angry in the more things 
change a woman hears an old boyfriend is running round town and 
cant help remarking only the names have changed 
other times they let go down at the twist and shout is an 
oldfashioned saturday night dance song a release from all that 
tension in going out tonight the woman is by herself but 
not for long she has empty arms and perfume on her wrist when she 
leaves her apartment her meddling heart will stay behind 
shes basically saying ive had enough of this mourning 
its almost a mercenary kind of thing shes going out of spite 
carpenter said 
thats the one song that was cowritten with coproducer 
john jennings we really went at each other from a malefemale kind 
of thing he came with what i thought were male ways of looking at 
it and i had a female way of looking at it 
musically carpenter mixes country folk and rock n roll the 
lyrics are simple conversational like excerpts from a diary 
there are no metaphors or any other devices to draw attention to 
the writer precise details the color of a shirt are what 
matter just taking a series of facts and emotions and shaping them 
into a story 
i personally feel the best satisfaction i can get after 
working on a tune is using the most succinct language concrete 
images not being too obtuse i dont like too many farflung 
images i just wanted to be as accurate and direct as possible 
she said 
with some writers i want to pull that curtain away ive 
always been more drawn to writers who are concrete people like guy 
clark i also like bruce cockburn hes a very literate direct 
writer 
carpenter was born in princeton nj but spent most of her 
childhood in washington dc she listened to her sisters beatles 
and motown records and by age 9 was playing guitar and scribbling 
down poems 
she was 19 when she first started performing appearing on open 
mike nights at a local bar after graduating from brown university 
she continued playing at bars in washington and eventually gathered 
enough material to make a demo 
columbia records signed her and her debut album hometown 
girl came out in 1987 state of the heart was released last 
year 
fame has brushed against her and quickly sped away on her first 
record she covered tom waits downtown train and was surprised 
to hear it in a washington mall last year she was listening to rod 
stewarts hit version 
in 1988 she wrote the sexy read my lips and to her horror 
the same phrase became george bushs campaign theme for not raising 
taxes the promise of carpenters words has held up longer 
but her own name may soon be good enough state of the heart 
produced four hits on the country charts and you win again is a 
hit off the new album she also received a standing ovation at this 
years country music association awards ceremony for the not so 
tongueincheek opening act 
the moon and st christopher off her new album is her most 
personal song a story so true it almost frightened her off the 
character can only be carpenter and shes pouring a lifetime of 
confessions into 4 minutes and 21 seconds 
i pray for the heart and nerve she sings she kicks herself 
for being such a stubborn woman in such stubborn times she 
regrets the times she ran from lovers and friends 
if her other songs are bulletins from the front updates on 
women seeking middle ground then the moon and st christopher 
is a prayer that all the battles are worth fighting a moment of 
reflection before picking herself up and giving the world another 
chance 
the tune basically happened because a friend of mine had some 
news that changed his life and kind of changedmine those things 
force you to examine who you are why you ended up the way you are 
what your failures were she said 
i feel kind of exposed by that song and its very scary in a 
way but its also about the most satisfying thing i wrote because 
i really got down to the nittygritty people tend to come up to 
you and tell you they got it they related to it it makes me think 
the more personal it is the more universal

young pianist falls in love with his 
beautiful world famous instructor is the oneline synopsis of 
matters of the heart a madeforcable movie premiering tonight 
on the usa network 
its accurate but not true as they say and does a disservice 
to an unabashed romance that stars jane seymour who seems only to 
grow more beautiful as she matures and lends new grace to the term 
middleaged 
shes the soul of this movie in her role as worldclass pianist 
hadley norman a lonely troubled woman who seeks to compose and 
drink in seclusion in a gritty little upstate new york town 
seymour shows courage as an actress in her first scenes 
allowing herself to be photographed looking like an unmade bed 
shes pale without makeup her hair is stringy and unkempt and she 
wears a ratty bathrobe 
director michael rhodes in one brief throwaway shot also shows 
us that shes a woman who likes cigarettes instant coffee and gin 
handy when she works 
the other half of the romance is steven harper chris gartin a 
gifted young pianist stranded in his hometown because he cant 
afford music school he looks ahead and sees only an eternity of 
work in his fathers hardware store 
we spend most of the movies early scenes with steven whos at 
loggerheads with his father excellently acted by james stacy an 
embittered man who lost an arm and leg in vietnam 
instead of encouraging his sons passionate musical ambitions 
the father is hostile to them gartin never overplays his 
18yearold characters angst and frustration its a much more 
powerful performance because of that control 
when steven approaches her for an autograph her wretched 
appearance and harsh neurotic behavior are offputting his 
worship of her artistic ability changes into concern for her as a 
person 
as steven tries to break down the barriers between them showing 
her his passion for the music so too does hadley lower her guard 
finally she consents to teach him and he flourishes 
the dynamics of their relationship begin to evolve his growing 
confidence and musicianship let him see her as a woman and her see 
him as a man a rising glissando of sexual tension turns into a 
emotional and physical involvement 
note there is some of what is charmingly called partial 
nudity but its nothing you wouldnt see at a beach the 
lovemaking and pillow talk we see have an intimacy and sexy 
tenderness that can only be called healthy 
as their love affair intensifies steven matures as an artist 
and as a man hadley seems happy at last and yet there is an 
ominous note in all this thats not audible in the background 
music 
and speaking of music theres lots of luscious mozart chopin 
and tchaikovsky in the sound track thanks to mona golabek a 
worldclass pianist who coached the actors on keyboard technique 
and performed many of the solos 
kudos also to the tremendously talented james stacy a longtime 
character actor who plays the disabled father with a special fire 
and pain 
not every viewer will realize that there is no clever makeup 
effect or standin at work stacy actually is disabled his 
impairments may limit the roles he can play but not his range 
the strengths of matters of the heart are its actors they 
create people who are recognizable and human and their 
relationships begin evolve and end 
what weakens the movie is that cowriters linda bergman and 
martin tahses plot devices are shopworn youll say aha the 
old lost dog to reunite the lovers gag surely here well see a 
clever twist on the old old story 
you will wait in vain for such higher designs 
theres even one unforgivable scene in which the lovers frolic 
in the snow affectionately lobbing snowballs at each other it 
looks like a chewing gum commercial do you suppose the director 
said ok kids rollick 
matters of the heart is not sophisticated it doesnt 
advance the art of romance who cares its the day after 
christmas tuck the kids away put on your new bathrobe and bunny 
slippers and curl up with someone cuddly 
surely matters of the heart deserve some attention tonight 
 
elsewhere in television 
more drama in television news barbara eden and heather locklear 
star on new years day in the madeforcbs movie her wicked 
ways which is billed as a contemporary drama of 
behindthescenes power struggles in broadcast news 
miss eden plays a respected television network white house 
correspondent who is next in line for the allimportant network 
anchor chair miss locklear plays an ambitious reporter whose 
devious machinations threaten all that 
miss eden a clever comedian beloved for her work in i dream 
of jeannie is cast here in a fantasy without comedy miss 
locklear wellknown for her work on dynasty and tj 
hooker has her work cut out for her

assistant sheriff chuck wheeler 
remembers when a crime wave in rural kitsap county consisted of 
punks breaking into a few empty summer homes 
now reports of murder rape and assault crowd his desk and 
wheeler has little time for petty burglary emergency calls to 911 
have soared 160 percent since 1980 the caseload has doubled at 
superior court where prosecutors share desks in a cramped 
obsolete building 
one of the nations few boom areas is battling something people 
used to move here to escape crime this oncepeaceful corner of 
puget sound is waking up to bigcity woes never dreamed of 10 years 
ago 
back then if we had one or two murders a year that was 
big wheeler said last year we had nine and they were all 
bizarre 
while much of the nation grapples with recession kitsap county 
remains economically strong its low unemployment and reputation as 
a scenic affordable place to live have made it one of the 
northwests fastestgrowing counties 
but theres a flip side the crime rate is soaring even faster 
than the population courts are clogged sheriffs deputies are 
stretched dangerously thin and oldtimers are left wondering what 
happened to their piece of paradise 
its not the sleepy little rural county that it used to be 
said county clerk bob freudenstein a 40year resident i myself 
have been burglarized two times in the last four years 
kitsap county spreads across the forested hills and placid 
saltwater coves of the kitsap peninsula an arrowheadshaped chunk 
of land jutting into puget sound 
for years the sound acted as a moat around the county fending 
off the urban sprawl of seattle across the water but now as 
highways between booming seattle and its landlocked suburbs clog 
with commuters a halfhour ferry ride seems less inconvenient 
kitsap countys bainbridge island has filled with ferry commuters 
central kitsap county meanwhile has built a thriving economy 
around the navy which runs a trident submarine base at bangor and 
a shipyard in bremerton the countys biggest city 
signs of growth are everywhere fresh ranks of condominiums 
march up hills around the 128store kitsap mall which opened in 
1985 placards announcing new housing plats pop up like mushrooms 
along back roads county population now 188800 has jumped 28 
percent since 1980 
also growing are demands on law enforcement but the sheriffs 
department hasnt kept pace despite recent hires the 85officer 
department still has fewer officers per residents than any other 
washington county 
county officials say more money would help them handle rising 
crime but taxpayers are cool to such proposals in november 
voters rejected a 31 million bond for a new courthouse 
bainbridge island residents carried the snub even further they 
voted to annex their entire island to the onisland town of winslow 
and run their affairs locally instead of relying on county 
officials far away in port orchard the county seat 
islanders hope to beef up their police force and enforce zoning 
more strictly to head off development 
we think we can retain the islands rurality said norm 
wooldridge a leader of the island revolt the county wasnt 
doing a very good job of it 
wheeler attributes some of the excess crime to burglaries in 
poorly patrolled outlying areas but an increase in violent crime 
notably 26 homicides since 1987 has baffled me for a long 
time he said 
1989 was especially bloody in january a man was shot to death 
by four teenagers who had waited at his home calmly discussing 
how to kill him in march three youths were killed as they sat in 
a pickup truck on a bainbridge island road in april a drifter 
raped an 83yearold woman then beat her to death with a coffee 
pot and whiskey bottle 
investigating such crime straps an already overworked sheriffs 
department lesser crimes especially those without leads often 
are shoved aside wheeler said 
that was obvious to bob and evelyn linden who awoke one morning 
to find their house burglarized a stereo knife and clock worth 
2000 were gone the bainbridge island couple reported the theft 
immediately but no officer showed up they called again a week 
later still nobody showed mr linden complained to a county 
commissioner 
a detective called and said they couldnt show up for some 
little burglary mrs linden recalled we told him we were in 
the house at the time and he said oh thats different he said 
hed be right out 
that was three years ago she said he never did come

disabled veterans start the new year without 
any costofliving increase in benefits but key members of 
congress have pledged to change that 
ive talked to the speaker and he feels very strongly and told 
me to be sure the cola increase gets into the march checks of the 
veterans said rep gv sonny montgomery the chairman of 
the house veterans affairs committee 
an omnibus veterans bill that included the costofliving 
increase died in the last congress because of a dispute over 
benefits for vietnam veterans exposed to agent orange 
the bill would have required an outside panel to examine 
scientific evidence to determine if there are links between the 
dioxincontaminated herbicide and health problems experience by 
vietnam veterans 
the legislation provided for a 54 percent increase in benefits 
for the 22 million veterans and 300000 widows or children that 
receive the disability payments thats the same costofliving 
increase that social security recipients will receive 
speaker thomas s foley dwash has told montgomery dmiss 
to move quickly to get disabled veterans a costofliving increase 
theyll be beating each over the heads to get to that one 
said sen alan k simpson rwyo the republican whip whose 
objections blocked a vote on the veterans bill 
monthly disability benefits now range from 76 to 1537 based 
on a disability scale that runs from 10 percent to 100 percent 
payments may be higher up to 2679 for multiple disabilities 
involving loss of limbs sight or hearing 
even if a bill passes quickly veterans wont get their increase 
until march but the increase would be made retroactive to jan 1 
the question is what role the agent orange dispute will have 
the people who are polarized on this issue theres a handful 
of them said john heilman national legislative director of the 
disabled american veterans they were willing to put our 
entitlements at risk that tail should not be wagging the entire 
dog 
other veterans groups and lawmakers who have fought for official 
recognition of a connection between agent orange exposure and a 
variety of diseases say they will resist efforts to enact a 
costofliving bill free of agent orange provisions they are less 
than sanguine however 
im not optimistic that weve got the votes said paul s 
egan legislative director for the vietnam veterans of america 
i think the only game in town is the linkage between the cola 
and the agent orange he said 
egan is worried about the makeup of the house veterans affairs 
committee which in october overruled montgomerys opposition and 
voted for agent orange provisions it was a breakthrough vote in 
the 12yearstruggle by vietnam veterans advocates 
on the senate side veterans affairs committee chairman alan 
cranston dcalif supports the agent orange provisions several 
key supporters led by sen thomas a daschle dsd promise they 
will try to force a vote on the agent orange issue 
but even there the pressure by older veterans is strong sen 
bob graham dfla has told veterans in his home state he will 
introduce a cola bill free of agent orange provisions 
ive been meeting with veterans groups in florida and i 
havent found very many who liked what congress did this year as 
relates to the cost of living increase he said it has caused 
a great deal of anxiety and anger 
his state is home to 140000 disabled veterans

when the new years clamor is over consumer 
borrowers will face a somewhat harsher tax environment one in 
which the helping hand of uncle sam will have been removed 
no longer will any part of personal interest payments be 
deductible on income tax returns 
it isnt a small matter a total of 7374 billion in such loans 
were outstanding in september and the monthly totals were rising 
steadily since last march moreover rates on these loans generally 
are the highest 
the demise of personal interest tax deductions has been little 
noted of late because in a sense it is old news as late as the 
mid1980s all such interest was deductible but then congress 
changed the rules 
with the tax reform legislation of 1986 personal interest 
deductions were phased out falling to only 10 percent of the total 
this year next year none of that interest on credit cards car 
loans revolving credit can be deducted 
in certain respects the demise of the deduction can be viewed 
as one of the first attempts at reducing americas emphasis on 
consumption over production which was a major issue of the 1980s 
that old emphasis some critics say led to the assumption of 
too much credit cut into savings rates denied industrial america 
domestic funds for expansion and improvement and even helped 
worsen the foreign payments balance 
it was in such a mood that congress decided on the phaseout 
lower the tax benefits it was reasoned and people will cut back 
on their use of credit that faith was misplaced personal loans 
continued to climb 
in fact so strong have they been been that banks and other 
lenders have seen little reason to seek customers by lowering 
interest rates today with rates in general falling most personal 
loan rates remain very high 
some bank cards for example still charge close to 20 percent 
even more a finance company was accused in new york recently of 
deceptively promoting loans at an annual rate of close to 25 
percent 
of the total outstanding commercial banks have about 350 
billion and finance companies more than 140 billion with the rest 
split among credit unions retailers savings institutions 
gasoline companies and organizations that buy pools of loans from 
the original lenders 
why did loan demand remain high in spite of the lost 
deductibility the answer isnt clear but some students of 
consumer behavior say the penalty just wasnt enough to convince 
borrowers to adjust to simpler lifestyles 
meanwhile the home equity loan added to household debt burdens 
by allowing deductions of most interest on loans to 100000 taken 
out after oct 13 1987 the loans neednt be homerelated you can 
use the money to buy a car 
thus the intent of congress in removing personal interest 
deductibility was largely undermined by the home equity provision 
which allowed borrowers to simply transfer creditcard debt to 
deductible status 
one assumption made at the time was that homeowners most of 
them good credit risks to begin with would prudently avoid 
endangering their home ownership 
whether they have been prudent is open t question fears exists 
that a recession with high unemployment could mean foreclosures 
and declines in values could worsen the predicament for borrowers 
and lenders alike 
the brighter side of the picture is that some personal interest 
rates might decline might that is if consumer demand for loans 
slackens

winning the olympics alone would have given 
atlanta reason to crow this year but then the heavyweight 
championship and what about landing a super bowl and a spot on 
the most liveable list and now grits meets glitz jane 
fonda too 
this citys triumphs finally gave substance to its boosters old 
nickname in 1990 it was hotlanta indeed 
true the olympics fireworks burst over a city that would pass a 
curfew to save its children from drug dealers true the mayor had 
to challenge preliminary census figures indicating his city was 
losing people 
but even if the ticker tape snowed on a cooling economy and on 
troubles common to urban area atlanta celebrated as it hadnt 
since the curtain went up on gone with the wind half a century 
ago 
in september a few months after being picked as the site of pro 
footballs 1994 super bowl dark horse atlanta beat out athens 
greece as host for the 1996 summer olympic games the confetti was 
barely swept up when hometowner evander holyfield brought boxings 
heavyweight title to the city tagged losersville for its sorry 
teams 
billboards around the nations 13th largest metropolitan area 
saluted hard work and chutzpah headlines hollered its 
atlanta on sidewalks and in grocery lines natives beamed 
at the atlanta historical society executive director john ott 
didnt know of another time when two parades had streamed down 
peachtree street within six weeks 
it may make atlantans like texans you know were the best 
were the greatest were the biggest he said we do have the 
sense that we have the wherewithal to capture things 
a city of dreams proclaimed atlanta magazine profiling 
its own parade of locals who realized grand visions from martin 
luther king jr to ted turner 
the latters atlantabased cable news network which many credit 
with raising the citys profile marked its 10th anniversary in 
1990 and in december ted and jane fonda that is whose causes 
and caresses filled the daily people columns announced their 
engagement 
along the way there were high marks for atlanta from arbiters 
as different as the population crisis committee tied for second 
highest score on list of worlds most liveable cities and the 
fortune industrial survey first among executives likely picks for 
future plant sites 
only three us cities attract more conventioneers and 
atlantas high profile this year will only enhance that said john 
jackson vice president of the atlanta convention and visitors 
bureau 
a few years ago i was in london and a gentlemn told me we 
needed to get our boardwalks fixed people associated atlanta with 
atlantic city jackson said thats not going to happen 
anymore atlanta is on the world map 
the 1988 democratic national convention provided a smallerscale 
dress rehearsal for events the city is now committed to staging he 
said adding that atlanta managed the attention well then some 
15000 reporters descended on the city and 95 percent or more of 
the stories were positive 
in 1989 however atlanta led the nations large cities in 
serious crime according to fbi statistics even though the city 
has shed that dubious distinction as crime figures declined this 
year some reporters continue to cite it said angelo fuster press 
secretary for mayor maynard jackson its terribly frustrating 
he said 
in november the city council restored a curfew for children 16 
and under that hadnt been in effect in nearly a decade prompted 
earlier by the socalled atlanta child murders cases in 
calling for a new curfew a sponsor cited killings in her district 
including that of a 4yearold girl 
civil libertarians doubted the curfew was constitutional but 
the mayor said it would help us fight drugs and protect our 
children 
city hall damage controllers went to work after preliminary 
figures from the us census bureau said atlantas population fell 
from 425000 to 384000 between 1980 and 1990 the city contending 
it had grown to 437000 said census takers overlooked many and 
undercounted others it demanded a recount 
cracks even began to show in the smiling facade of unanimity 
that helped win the olympics residents near the proposed sites of 
certain venues protested that their neighborhoods would suffer 
some activists worried that officials would try to sweep 
lingering problems like homelessness from visitors view rather 
than working to solve them 
there are blighted neighborhoods in the path of stadiums all 
over atlanta that are going to have to be gentrified complained 
anita beaty director of the ctys task force for the homeless 
which counted 47000 individuals who sought emergency housing last 
year 
ms beaty said shes concerned that money which could go toward 
shelter and other needs will instead be used for superficial 
beautification she called for more public involvement in planning 
im no longer saying we dont want the olympics thats 
useless she said im saying how can we benefit how can 
we manage the impact 
the super bowl and the olympics are new chapters in an old story 
of selfpromotion and courting outsiders that has helped define the 
city that grew from a railroad terminus torched by gen william t 
sherman in the civil war atlanta adopted the motto resurgens 
latin for rising again and never forgot that goal 
after the civil war atlanta editor and orator henry grady 
trumpeted a new south less splendid on the surface but 
stronger at the core a hundred farms for every plantation and 
a diversified industry that meets the needs of this complex age 
northerners liked what they heard and yankee investment poured 
in to the new souths capital 
that typifies atlantas style welcome anybody particularly 
if theyve got a few dollars said jack spalding former editor 
of the atlanta journal 
people say the olympics good god how can you handle it 
spalding said but he cited precedents notably a civic showcase 
mounted just three decades after shermans destruction the 1895 
cotton states and international exposition it attracted 800000 
people nearly 10 times the citys population 
other than to get attention here was absolutely no 
justification for it spalding said a smile wrinkling his eyes 
atlantas always had a lot of imagination

abandoned by her mother raised in a small west 
virginia town by an abusive aunt and a lecherous uncle elizabeth 
didnt seem to have a chance 
but when her impoverished family couldnt even provide a 
bathtub and a school counselor complained she was dirty she made 
the swim team so she could get a daily shower 
too poor to ever dream of owning a clarinet or violin she 
joined the school band anyway playing whatever instrument the 
school had to offer 
for years psychologists studied children who crumbled under the 
weight of a traumatic upbringing reinforcing the notion that 
abused children become ruined adults 
but recently they have come to believe that the elizabeths of 
the world called transcenders by one researcher can yield 
clues on how to help all kinds of troubled children 
lessons learned from transcenders may be used to help those who 
cant rise above the circumstances of their lives said norman 
watt a professor of psychology at the university of denver 
in a sense they are experiments in natural therapy he said 
the kid whose mom is schizophrenic who still grows to be a rhodes 
scholar may tell us something about how nature works 
life for transcenders is often short sharp and brutish 
said karen northcraft a psychiatric social worker in evansville 
ind who taped 20 hours of conversations with elizabeth the 
subject of her doctoral dissertation 
but they do well in situations anyone else would find 
crushing she said if they had been born into different 
families they might have been prodigies 
elizabeth told northcraft of bonebreaking beatings by her aunt 
who she said once stripped her naked and dunked her in a vat of 
scalding water she told of the night when she was 8 that her uncle 
got into her bed and sexually molested her for the first time in 
what would be five years of assaults 
elizabeths aunt often told her that her mother had sold her for 
25 
her battle did not end with grade school she gained admission 
to college and was told she was dyslexic and should drop out but 
she worked her way through school earned a graduate degree and 
became a family therapist 
what happened how could she possibly have endured 
northcraft said elizabeth told her the turning point came in the 
4th grade one of her secret pleasures was her long blonde curls 
when her aunt shaved her head the well of pride anger and 
determination buried within her broke through 
after that she was able to reject what her aunt was saying 
and start making her life better said northcraft who met 
elizabeth through another professor familiar with her work 
transcenders are smart resourceful and independent thinkers 
they all have the potential because of family surroundings to 
suffer social or psychological problems but transcenders seek out 
other ways to live northcraft said 
they have selfconfidence and early on they think for 
themselves northcraft said they emotionally distance 
themselves from their parents and they choose their actions rather 
than do what would be expected in their environment 
northcraft cited one case study of a boy whose schizophrenic 
mother thought the familys food was poisoned the womans two 
daughters believed her delusions and would not touch the food but 
the little boy ate heartily 
asked why he responded well im not dead yet 
the sisters grew up neurotic the boy went off to college and 
was successful and happy 
in the worst of times transcenders envision themselves 
elsewhere imaginingthat they can do great things despite their 
surroundings northcraft said 
they include all kinds of people from the very obscure to the 
wellknown such as actress carol burnett the daughter of two 
alcoholics who as a girl dreamed of someday going to college 
richard rhodes in his new book a hole in the world an 
american boyhood details how he and his brother were viciously 
abused by their stepmother he went on to win a pulitzer prize 
and theyre like mary 25 who grew up with an alcoholic father 
who often flew into violent rages 
hed come home and accuse mom of having affairs she said in 
a telephone interview hed beat up people who drove too fast on 
our block 
amid a family life of constant crisis she felt always 
demoralized 
the hardest thing was to emotionally separate myself from the 
craziness that went on in my family she said it still goes on 
and it still hurts but when you separate yourself you dont get as 
involved with it 
she now is at the university of denver working toward a double 
major in psychology and sociology and maintaining a b average 
northcraft said she decided to join the small group of 
professors studying transcenders when she found volumes of research 
devoted to troubled children but little to those who succeeded 
most studies on such children have come only in the last 10 to 15 
years she said 
we know much more about the factors for failure then for 
success northcraft said its become conventional wisdom to 
say well i was battered as a kid so ill batter my kids 
now such attitudes may be changing said watt 
the ethos used to be that if your parent was schizophrenic 
the chances you will be too are high he said now thats 
changing we are starting to unlearn that previous message 
i think this is part of a movement to focus on health rather 
than pathology northcraft said my whole notion is if we can 
identify factors that enable transcenders to succeed then we bring 
them to bear on other children at risk 
the most important lesson any child may be able to transcend a 
hurtful home life if just one supportive stable adult a teacher 
friend or counselor is around to help said michael goldstein a 
professor of psychology at ucla 
one child we studied had a psychotic parent goldstein 
recalls but he built up a relationship with a neighbor who 
taught him electronics and how to fix things the kid went on to 
become an engineer and a relatively happy person 
adult transcenders still carry the emotional scars of their 
childhoods said northcraft who dubbed them transcenders because 
she disliked the moniker some psychologists gave them 
invulnerable 
theyre very hurt they do have scars no matter how 
successful they become northcraft said there are costs 
transcenders survive in spite of their pain 
elizabeth still hurts but she has helped heal herself 
i looked into my soul elizabeth said there is nothing 
that i am hiding

time was when 13 breweries bottled beer in 
new orleans for folks to wash down their jambalaya and gumbo 
brands like pelican union security and weckerling provided 
about 3000 jobs making new orleans the brewing capital of the 
south 
now the old falstaff building is little more than decaying 
bricks and peeling signs the jax brewery in the french quarter has 
been transformed into an upscale shopping mall and tourist 
attraction only dixie survives 
im committed to not letting this brewery die said kendra 
elliott bruno who bought the struggling brand for an undisclosed 
amount in 1985 
founded in 1907 dixie established itself as the frontrunner 
with new orleans beer drinkers after prohibition it once claimed 
as much as 29 percent of the local market 
then came the infamous bad batch of 75 
over the fourth of july weekend in 1975 dixie beer hit the 
stores tasting of phenol new floors in the brewerys cellars 
where brewing water was stored emitted the fumes they ended up in 
the water and then in the beer 
dixie was so much a part of neworleans such a familiar part 
of the way of life here people who bought a bottle or a sixpack 
of that batch remember where they were and what they were doing 
when they tasted it the way you remember where you were and what 
you were doing on the day john kennedy was shot said robert 
oertling then a dixie vice president 
from a yearly output of more than 200000 barrels dixie 
plummeted to 60000 the company came within a hair of joining the 
hundreds of small local breweries killed off by competitive wars 
with the beer giants 
since then four dixie presidents have tried everything to 
restore the market knocking on doors giving away free beer 
lobbying for tax breaks laying off workers none of it worked 
the day we bought it they told us if we didnt dixie beer 
would be dead in 15 minutes ms bruno said i guess it was the 
challenge that hooked me i always say i must have been very 
optimistic or crazy 
shes also a fighter 
i was a very shy person when we bought dixie she said 
now i just stick my hand out and start telling everyone i meet 
about this company 
ms bruno has done everything from ride the distribution trucks 
asking bar owners and markets to carry dixie beer to meeting with 
business leaders and state officials 
a state tax exemption given the brewery in 1982 that saved the 
company up to 750000 a year was rescinded after several beer 
distributors filed suit claiming dixie was getting preferential 
treatment 
in may 1989 dixie filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy court 
reorganization after the city gave the company 24 hours to come up 
with 375000 in overdue taxes dixie owed the state almost 16 
million in sales excise and unemployment taxes at the time it 
also owed more than 200000 in past due water bills 
since we filed weve made great progress up until now we 
were reacting to the problems that were here when we bought the 
brewery now we have the time to act ms bruno said 
since filing chapter 11 which allows the company to reorganize 
its debts while it remains open dixies finances have broken even 
several months ms bruno said 
the company employs 60 people and produces less than 50000 
barrels of beer a month 
we make beer the oldfashioned way ms bruno said many 
breweries are all automated now this one still uses people 
in addition to dixie which comes in longnecks cans and draft 
the company sells dixie amber light in 23 states and 10 countries 
dixie is more fullflavored than many beers said brewmaster 
guy hagner everything in new orleans is turned up a notch the 
music the food and the beer people here like flavor more people 
eat zips french bread than wonder bread dixie is made for people 
who want flavor i think more people have developed their palates 
for that today 
this fall the company introduced blackened voodoo lager an 
allmalt beverage that hagner describes as a flavorful speciality 
beer 
we did two barrels of it and put it in one bar it went 
instantly less than two days he said 
a company in england got wind of the new brew and ordered 1100 
cases without even tasting it ms bruno said

behind the pleas to save the trees and 
loggers cries for saving jobs millions of dollars are being 
wagered on a congressional fight for control of the nations oldest 
forests 
the timber and paper products industry contributed nearly 5 
million to presidential and congressional candidates over the last 
eight years including more than 775000 to current members of the 
senate and the house from five northwestern states according to 
federal records 
environmental groups countered with just over 2 million in the 
same period according to the records 
today politics is part of doing business says ned massee 
manager of government relations for westvaco corp one of the 
countrys largest producers of paper products 
the new yorkbased owner of 11 million acres of us 
timberlands led the industry with 716700 in political action 
committee contributions from 1983 through 1990 records at the 
federal election commission show 
ali webb of the league of conservation voters said we lost 
several elections this year because we couldnt help challengers 
with sufficient resources 
both sides seem likely to continue pressing their cause as 
congress struggles to decide on the best use for the countrys 
forests 
the two sides deny partisan preference in their political 
contributions yet 73 percent of the timber money went to 
republicans and 93 percent of the environmental contributions went 
to democrats according to election commission records 
envirnomentalists favor cutbacks in logging to protect the 
northern spotted owl and other threatened creatures to slow 
degradation of soils and streams and to enhance wilderness 
recreation 
industry says such a break from traditional timber practices 
would cripple logging communities cost tens of thousands of jobs 
and sharply raise prices for wood products 
the northern spotted owl has become the most visible symbol of 
this struggle with the bush administration working to develop a 
plan that can save the owl while limiting the loss of jobs in the 
lumber industry 
in a federally mandated effort to protect the threatened owl 
logging is expected to drop in the pacific northwest by about 20 
percent next year environmentalists have enlisted dozens of 
legislators in support of even broader forestprotection proposals 
which would cut harvests at least in half 
this year president bush also signed into law toughened 
restrictions on exports of unprocessed logs from federal and state 
lands several members of congress want a similar ban on exports of 
raw logs from private lands as a way of boosting jobs for domestic 
processors 
sen slade gorton rwash is the industrys favorite recipient 
of contributions with a total of 103413 sen mark hatfield 
rore is next with 68980 
neither could be reached for comment gortons press secretary 
kraig naasz said the money has not influenced gortons voting 
i think our level of contributions from the timber industry is 
more reflective of slades devotion to timber communities and their 
livelihood naasz said 
reps jim clarke dnc jim jontz dind and les aucoin 
dore were the financial champions of the environmental 
lobbyists clarke had contributions of 44331 jontz 31992 
aucoin 31896 
aucoin is one of five legislators who received at least 10000 
from each side the others are sens wyche fowler dga and john 
chafee rri and reps john miller rwash and richard 
stallings didaho 
since january 1983 industry donations have gone to four in five 
of the current members of the senate and more than twothirds of 
the current members of the house election commission documents and 
common cause reports show 
aside from westvaco other heavy hitters include international 
paper co union camp corp weyerhaeuser co georgiapacific 
corp boise cascade corp and the national forest products 
association 
when you analyze a company like boise cascade and the various 
businesses we are in the impacts that state and federal government 
can have on us are immense said kirk sullivan a vice president 
for the company in boise idaho the company owns or controls 62 
million acres of timberlands and manufactures and distributes paper 
and paper products and building materials 
the sierra club tops the contributor list for environmental 
groups spending 12 million over the last eight years the league 
of conservation voters is next with 701271 
eight other environmental groups registered with the fec spent a 
total of less than 300000 since january 1983 more than 40 forest 
and paper industry pacs are on file 
industry contributions have increased steadily in each of the 
last four twoyear election cycles from 1 million in 198384 to 
14 million in the last cycle the records show 
environmentalists spent about 425000 in 198990 according to 
the records their peak period was 734143 in 198384 about 
onethird of it directed against the reelection of president 
reagan 
more than 50 senators have received at least 10000 from the 
industry 20 received more than 30000 of the 435 house members 
68 got at least 10000 from the industry and 18 pulled in more 
than 30000 
fortyone senators and four in 10 house members picked up checks 
from environmental groups ten senators and 18 house members 
received more than 10000

consider the california condor the arabian 
oryx the guam rail the blue poison dart frog they are among the 
endangered species that have been successfully bred in captivity as 
zoologists take the offensive to save many forms of wildlife from 
extinction such conservation programs have now spread to more than 
150 zoos and aquariums 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
no longer mere display cases for natures 
creatures the nations zoos and aquariums are taking a more active 
role in trying to save species that are rapidly disappearing from 
the wild 
the american association of zoological parks and aquariums 
headquartered in bethesda md coordinates a captivebreeding 
program for more than 50 endangered species at more than 150 zoos 
and aquariums 
its not the same old zoo anymore its not the little guy 
with a mustache pushing a broom around says dick george 
spokesman for the phoenix zoo in arizona we have a 
responsibility to face up to in the next decade it looks like we 
are going to be perpetual hosts to these animals 
for example in steamy cinderblock rooms next to the rain forest 
exhibit at the national aquarium in baltimore curator jack cover 
heads the breeding of the threatened blue poison dart frog 
herpetologists at the aquarium in 1988 became the first to breed 
the species their success came after they spent five years 
carefully recreating the frogs natural environment only to find 
the tiny creatures prefer the bottom of a plastic 2liter soda 
bottle 
however the progeny have never lived up to their name the 
captiveborn frogs whose parents were found in the wild in 
isolated pockets of jungle in suriname have never produced the 
deadly poison researchers want to study 
many zoologists fear that they may become curators of living 
museum pieces that wont have a home to return to in the wild one 
of the biggest enemies of endangered species has been habitat 
destruction but overhunting pollution and introduced predators 
those brought by man have also taken a toll 
when you cut down a rain forest youre not just cutting down 
trees cover says youre cutting down the environment for 
thousands of species 
to avoid extinction an estimated 2000 species of large 
invertebrates will need to be bred in the next two decades says 
michael hutchins director of science and conservation for the zoos 
and aquariums association however only 900 species can be bred 
using current facilities he says 
space is extremely limited decisions we make now will 
probably doom some species to extinction and save others says 
hutchins who oversees the groups species survival plan the 
same kind of decisions will have to be made for wild animas 
some estimates are that 1 million species of animals and 
plants could go extinct in the next two decades we dont know what 
kind of impact that is going to have 
zoos may need to maintain captive populations for as long as 200 
years until world population growth can be controlled and native 
habitats restored some biologists say 
in addition zoologists may be forced in the future to move 
animals in the wild from place to place to maintain genetic 
diversity and veterinarians may need to make jungle calls to keep 
wild populations healthy hutchins says 
i tell people that zoos are going to have to change as much in 
the next 10 years as they have in the past 100 if they are to 
fulfill their role in conservation hutchins says 
to be selected for the species survival plan a species must be 
endangered and must be abundant enough in captivity to form a 
viable gene pool computer records are kept of every animal and its 
lineage to prevent inbreeding 
the aim of the program which began in 1981 is to create a 
selfsustaining captive population for each species the goal is to 
reintroduce the animals to the wild 
the phoenix zoo works with 14 species in the species survival 
plan and has successfully reintroduced the arabian oryx similar to 
an antelope to the deserts of oman and jordan the point defiance 
zoo in tacoma wash and the wild canid survival center near st 
louis have reintroduced red wolves to a north carolina wildlife 
refuge

the philadelphia zoo has bred the guam rail a small tropical 
bird that resembles a sandpiper the cincinnati zoo implanted an 
embryo from an endangered indian desert cat into a surrogate mother 
a domestic house cat that nursed the kitten as if it were her 
own 
at the aquarium in baltimores redeveloped inner harbor still 
one of the most polluted areas of the chesapeake bay a collection 
of crickets wax worms fruit flies and other insects are kept in 
rows of bottles on a shelf in a cramped pungent work area behind 
the rain forest exhibit 
above the bottles is a sign reading time flies like an arrow 
fruit flies like a banana 
what blue poison dart frogs like is a diet high in calcium and 
phosphorous humidity and privacy the threequarterinch 
blueandblack frog is sonamed because it secretes a deadly 
alkaloid similar to curare which south american indians use to 
make poison darts 
in the wild they lay their eggs under large jungle leaves 
cover says weve found the bottom of 2liter soda bottles are a 
real good breeding hut we put a plastic leaf in a petri dish and 
put the bottle over the top 
the male does a courtship dance the female if receptive 
follows him in and does an elaborate courtship dance with all kinds 
of stroking and spinning then she lays her eggs and hell 
fertilize them 
cover and his colleagues are still working on how to get the 
frogs to produce the toxin medical researchers want to study 
herpetologists and others have tried several unorthodox methods 
special diets didnt work nor did daily handling of the frogs 
they thought cold baths which would simulate the dangers of the 
wild might be the key 
we actually tested that hypothesis cover says but in the 
wild the frog would already have to have the poison the first time 
a predator comes down there wouldnt be a second chance so 
danger doesnt seem like it would stimulate production 
perhaps the mostnown endangered species is the california 
condor the largest land bird in north america which has a 
wingspan of up to 10 feet there are 40 california condors known to 
exist and all are in captivity 21 at the san diego wild animal 
park and 19 at the los angeles zoo 
the last condor known to exist in the wild was captured in 1987 
before 1985 scientists had hoped to breed them in captivity and in 
the wild but between 1984 and 1985 four of the last five breeding 
pairs in the wild were lost and presumed dead in 1985 federal 
officials decided to capture all remaining wild condors in a 
lastditch effort to save the species 
that effort drew criticism from several environmental groups 
but it appears to have been the right choice 
when we first hatched birds in captivity it was pretty 
exciting says dr michael wallace curator of birds at the los 
angeles zoo we were under a lot of pressure from outside groups 
to release the birds its good to see we could not only do it but 
do it fairly well 
four of the vulturelike chicks were hatched this year at the 
san diego park and four at the los angeles zoo that success has 
enabled zoologists to consider reintroducing some of the condors 
into the wild as early as next year several years ahead of 
schedule 
despite their successes zoologists are quick to remind that 
breeding programs are only part of the solution 
zoos are looking at being part of a holistic program 
hutchins says if we are going to save species we just cant 
save them in zoos but at least having these populations in 
captivity provides us with the option of reintroducing them

tea that no cabin numbers end in 13 and that the ships concert 
survives as the passenger talent show 
he would be particularly gratified to learn that when her 
majesty calls cunard ships still go off to war as the qe2 did 
with a helicopter pad covering its swimming pool in the falkland 
islands war after all he was knighted for deploying his entire 
eightship fleet to transport troops and horses to the crimean war 
sir samuel wouldnt be too upset at finding cunards main 
operations are now centered in new york and not london or 
liverpool halifax nova scotia was his birthplace and home port 
when the admiralty awarded him the contract to convey the mails 
from a point in england to halifax and back twice each month he 
ordered four steam and sail paddlewheelers built and began the 
service in 1850 with boston at the aft end of what cunard captains 
still call the western crossing 
but how in all thunderation did a cunard ship wind up with a 
name like the vistafjord or the sagafjord or seagoddess i or ii 
in sam cunards day and for almost 100 years all cunarders had 
names ending in ia saxonia media parthia lucania campania 
franconia caronia nearly 200 of them all the way from that first 
paddlewheeler the britannia to the elegant fourstackers like 
the aquitania the lusitania and the mauretania 
then along came the queen mary and that legend of how the litany 
ended cunard favored the name victoria for its first 
1000footlong superliner during a grouse shoot at balmoral 
castle company director lord rydon asked king george vs 
permission to name the new flagship for the most illustrious and 
remarkable woman who has ever been queen of england not thinking 
at all of his grandmother his majesty replied this is the 
greatest compliment ever paid to my wife ill ask her as soon as i 
get home 
a queens whim altered the name of cunards current flagship 
which was to have been called the queen elizabeth like its famous 
predecessor but at the moment of launching queen elizabeth ii 
impulsively christened her queen elizabeth 2 insisting on the 
arabic numeral to avoid any thought that she was naming the ship 
after herself 
the former norwegian american liners vistafjord and sagafjord 
ran up cunards familiar ensign of a lion rampant after their 
purchase in 1983 most of their officers signed on with the new 
owners so that now cunards fifth avenue headquarters is staffed 
by a number of norwegian vice presidents and a couple of swedes 
what we call the scandinavian mafia laughed capt sverre 
brakstad of the vistafjord who as a boy in oslo never dreamed of 
commanding a cunarder i thought you had to be born on the clyde 
or in bristol 
over a century and a half cunards teakwood decks have echoed 
to the tread of history and heaved and pitched with the waves of 
everpassing social change 
in samuel cunards lifetime his ships reduced from six to two 
weeks the time it took a letter to reach new york from london they 
carried the first great waves of irish and german immigrants and 
such illustrious passengers as charles dickens jenny lind and mark 
twain 
soon cunards transatlantic ships doubled and tripled in size 
the sophia was the first to boast electric illumination 
throughout before the turn of the century travel posters touted 
the lines floating cities the 600footlong campania and 
lucania with funnels as high as the eddystone lighthouse 
marconi conducted wireless experiments aboard the lucania enabling 
the first ships newspaper to be slipped under cabin doors 
in the early part of the 20th century british stately homes 
went to sea under the names lusitania mauretania and aquitania 
as one critic described the luxuriant fourstackers 
then suddenly the cunard saga was written in grim headlines not 
travel brochures the carpathia racing to pick up survivors of 
competing white star lines flagship titanic the lusitania going 
to the bottom in 18 minutes with a loss of 1198 lives torpedoed 
off the irish coast by uboat 20 on may 7 l915 
cunard lost 20 ships in world war i but won historys only sea 
battle between ocean liners when the carmania engaged the cap 
trafalgar off the brazilian coast capsizing the hamburg south 
american liner after a deadly exchange between gun crews 
prohibition ushered in the popular booze cruises with jazz 
age swingers such as zelda and scott fitzgerald sailing off to 
havana or nassau to slake their thirst

at john brown shipyard on clydeside in scotland the great 
depression halted work for two years on hull no 534 idling more 
than 3500 workers but the queen mary the mostbeloved of all 
cunard ships finally made her maiden voyage on may 27 1936 
when the ship reporters came aboard from the pilot boat there 
was never a shortage of royalty real or hollywood on the 
cunarders emperor haile selassie of ethiopia the shah of iran and 
the sultan of jahore favored the queen mary as did the exiled 
edward viii and the duchess of windsor who traveled with 75 trunks 
in the hold and 70 pieces of luggage in their suite 
film queens from mary pickford to elizabeth taylor climbed up on 
the rail wreathed in a life preserver for the requisite 
cheesecake publicity shot gertrude lawrence was in the captains 
doghouse for walking her pomeranian on the boat deck and not the 
kennel deck liberace in gold lame jacket scuttled protocol by 
insisting that cabin and touristclass passengers attend his 
concert mae west who got a life jacket named for her prow was 
beloved by the crew for her large tips and the final night party 
she threw for waiters and stewards who served her 
the evenlarger queen elizabeth down to two stacks made her 
debut in time to don gray livery and go off to war as a troopship 
zigzagging and outspeeding submarines the queens delivered 
millions of british and commonwealth soldiers to every war zone 
transporting whole us divisions for the normandy invasion 
the mary once packed 16683 aboard the queens in winston 
churchills estimation shortened the war in europe by at least a 
year the uboats never got close but there was one tragedy when 
the queen mary in rough seas collided with her escort hms curacao 
slicing the cruiser in half wartime rules did not permit 
endangering her prime cargo of 15000 soldiers by picking up 
survivors 
the united states paid cunard 91 million for deploying 16 
million gis on the queens a bargain rate of 57 per passenger 
considering that teak decks caked with chewing gum banned too late 
in the ships canteens had to be replaced along with miles of 
mahogany railings whittled away by initials unit numbers and 
visits from kilroy 
cunard hit its postwar peak in the 50s carrying onethird of 
all transatlantic passengers on 12 liners but on an october 
morning in 1958 bridge officers on the queen elizabeth saw the 
first commercial jet roar off from new yorks idlewild airport as 
jfk airport was then known soon the queens were each losing 1 
million a year when the queen elizabeth docked at hudson river 
pier 90 with 900 crew and less than 200 paying guests the end of 
the line for liners was gloomily predicted 
theyre always predicting the end of the line for us 
laughed capt barkstad during a cruise in the black sea yet 
more people travel by ship today than ever before competition has 
never been keener newer cruise ships holding 2500 or more are 
being launched the airplane has proved to be our best friend we 
could never operate cruise schedules around the world without it 
cunard has seven cruise ships calling at 240 ports around the 
world and the qe2 still keeps up a semblance of transatlantic 
service with 18 crossings a year 
contrary to an unsinkable legend cunard captains throughout the 
lines history have rarely been called on to perform marriages 
brakstad who has been a captain for half of his 56 years has 
yet to tie any marital knots but he does have a plaque in his sea 
cabin that reads all marriages performed by this captain are 
valid only for the duration of the voyage

to some the welfare systems in northern europe 
are the worlds most humane to others theyre a wasteful gravy 
train supporting thousands of people who could work if they had 
to now an economic downturn is threatening the generous systems 
and some people living off them will feel the pinch

some of northern europes welfare 
states wonder how to keep their cradletograve safety nets from 
fraying in the impending recession 
in the postworld war ii boom years the scandinavian countries 
the netherlands and west germany introduced programs that spend up 
to a quarter of the gross national product on welfare 
welfare spending now is outstripping the industrial growth that 
was supposed to pay the bill with growth slowing in many european 
countries some governments are considering cutbacks 
with less money available for welfare government officials 
complain more loudly about people abusing the system 
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers says his nations welfare 
system which will cost the government 1323 billion guilders 
796 billion in 1991 is out of hand 
in a recent report the organization for economic cooperation 
and development citing hollands high income taxes and generous 
welfare benefits concluded that incentives to work are low the 
nation has an 11 percent unemployment rate 
dutch authorities recently failed to lure jobless amsterdam 
residents to the understaffed flower industry even after the 
government offered a car for every four workers to use for 
commuting as well as personal use 
denmark spends 40 percent of its budget on the 14 million 
people 28 percent of the population who live on welfare the 
centerright coalition government of prime minister poul schlueter 
hopes it can reduce welfare dependency by stimulating private 
industry 
denmark has 20000 people under 40 years of age getting 
permanent government pensions of 3709 kroner 662 a month 
because of drug or alcohol problems 
in europe welfare helps the employed as well as the jobless 
the system commonly includes free medical insurance sick pay 
disability and old age pensions and childcare and unemployment 
benefits 
in sweden parents can qualify for benefits for taking time off 
to nurse a sick child 
the basic thing is that everyone should have basic 
opportunities to take part in all activities within our 
society said annchristen filipson of the swedish social affairs 
ministry 
scandinavian taxpayers can hardly be expected to dig deeper in 
their pockets to pay a greater share of the welfare costs their 
tax rates of more than 50 percent already are highest in the 
industrialized world 
last october swedens ruling social democratic party made the 
first cuts ever in a social welfare system now costing 25139 
billion kronor 4513 billion just over onefifth of the gnp 
the government is expected to cut 15 billion kronor 269 
billion dollars from the welfare budget in 1991 the government is 
also planning to cut sick pay rates from 100 percent to 75 percent 
of a workers salary for the first three days in an effort to 
discourage malingering workers take an average 25 days of sick 
leave a year 
the welfare programs are usually funded by taxes paid by 
employers and employees and some are getting fed up 
ove danemar of the swedish employers federation criticized 
the whole system because it stimulates people to work less 
and to take more leisure time 
the private sector cant bear it any longer he said its 
no longer consistent with a modern economy 
critics say many of the benefits were begun in good faith but 
have ended up being abused during more favorable economic times 
the abuse was widely tolerated but with the continent entering a 
recession there is more clamping down on wasteful spending 
lubbers has vowed to curb hollands unsuitability for work act 
under which nearly 900000 people get lifelong disability pensions 
of up to 70 percent of their lastearned pay in the late 1970s 
some companies used it by dismissing unproductive employees 
passing the social cost on to the government 
about onethird of the programs beneficiaries claim 
psychological reasons for being unable to work in a recent speech 
lubbers said wryly looking at the statistics one has to 
admit that ours is a sick nation 
this spring the dutch government is expected to make deep cuts 
in the housing education and cultural subsidies that complement 
the welfare handouts themselves equal to at least 70 percent of 
the minimum wage it has borrowed heavily and diverted money from 
other programs to cover welfare costs 
only germany is making large welfare increases to pay millions 
of former east germans who are unemployed 
norway is slightly expanding its 1258 billion kroner 21 
billion welfare system on which almost a quarter of the 
population depends in some form or other the labor government has 
added about one billion kroner 166 million to the bill since 
coming into office last month and even the rightleaning opposition 
progress party favors the expansion

new federal taxes will raise the price of 
tobacco beverage alcohol and some luxuries beginning tuesday while 
upperbracket americans will have to pay higher income taxes to 
help reduce the nations budget deficit 
the changes combined with the 51centagallon gasoline tax 
increase that took effect dec 1 will raise the average 
households federal tax bill by about 215 a year congress 
estimates the average family making less than 50000 will pay an 
extra 1 a week 
those with incomes between 50000 and 100000 will pay about 
278 a year more on the average the increase for the 
100000to200000 group will average 839 the richest 600000 
couples and individuals with incomes over 200000 will pay an 
average of 8598 more per year 
congress hit topincome earners to correct what many lawmakers 
perceived as overly generous tax cuts during the 1980s the new law 
boosts the top incometax rate on people at that income level 
restricts their itemized deductions phases out the value of their 
personal exemptions and subjects more of their wages to medicare 
payroll taxes 
on the other hand prior law will give all taxpayers bigger 
exemptions and other adjustments designed to prevent last years 
inflation from raising their income taxes 
the new year also brings a major increase in the earnedincome 
tax credit which benefits lowincome working families with 
children and expanded tax incentives for energy investment 
here are highlights of the changes 
tobacco taxes are rising by 25 percent meaning the 16cent tax 
on a pack of cigarettes goes to 20 cents other levies as much as 
30 per 1000 large cigars 1125 per 1000 small cigars chewing 
tobacco 12 cents a pound snuff 36 cents a pound pipe tobacco 
67 cents a pound 
alcohol the liquor tax goes up 1 to 1350 for a gallon of 
100proof 50 percent alcohol an extra 20 cents a fifth for 
100proof 16 cents for 80proof the beer tax is doubled to 32 
cents a sixpack the tax on wine is rising depending on alcohol 
content table wine now 17 cents a gallon goes to 107 the levy 
on artificially carbonated wine now 240 goes to 330 a gallon 
luxuries a new 10 percent tax applies to that portion of the 
price above 30000 for cars 100000 for boats 250000 for 
aircraft and 10000 for furs and jewelry vehicles including 
taxis and cruise ships used to transport people for hire are 
exempt 
the tax applies only to the first retail sale of an item 
however coopers amp lybrand accountants note for example that if 
stones from an antique bracelet worth 10000 were reset into a new 
piece of jewelry worth 15000 the tax would be levied against 
5000 
telephone service the 3 percent tax on local and longdistance 
telephone service which had been scheduled to expire dec 31 was 
made permanent 
gas guzzlers the penalty tax on fuelthirsty cars is doubled 
any new car bought in 1991 with an epa rating under 22 miles per 
gallon is subject to a tax ranging from 1000 for a 21mpg 
model to 7700 less than 12 mpg 
tax rates a quirk in the 1986 law that allowed some topincome 
people to pay a lower rate on part of their earnings than applied 
to those with slightly less income has been eliminated this 
results in a new top rate of 31 percent down from 33 percent the 
majority of americans will continue to pay a flat rate of 15 
percent on their taxable income 
because of the new law and the automatic inflation adjustments 
the new rate structure looks like this 
single people pay 15 percent of the first 20350 of taxable 
income after exemptions and deductions 28 percent on the next 
28950 and 31 percent on everything over 49300 
couples filing a joint return pay 15 percent of the first 
34000 of taxable income 28 percent on the next 48150 and 31 
percent on everything over 82150 
exemptions increased by 100 to 2150 once adjusted gross 
income agi exceeds 100000 for a single person or 150000 for a 
couple the exemptions are reduced gradually they are eliminated 
totally once income tops 222500 single or 272500 couple 
standard deductions go up from 3250 to 3400 for singles and 
from 5450 to 5700 for couples 
itemized deductions couples and individuals with agi over 
100000 will be allowed to use only 97 percent of otherwise 
allowable itemized deductions the limit does not apply to medical 
expenses investment interest or deductions for theft or casualty 
losses 
costs of cosmetic surgery will be allowed as a deductible 
medical expense only if the procedure is necessary to correct a 
deformity arising from a birth defect accident or disfiguring 
disease egoboosting tummy tucks and facelifts are out nobody can 
yet say for sure whether orthodontic braces will continue to be 
deductible 
social security taxes the 10 million workers who earn more than 
51300 a year will pay a higher social security tax the rate 
remains 62 percent but will apply to the first 53400 earned in 
1991 up from the maximum 51300 in 1990 
the 145 percent tax generally lumped together on paycheck 
stubs with the social security tax that finances medicare hospital 
benefits will apply to the first 125000 earned in 1991 up from 
51300 in 1990 
workers social security and medicare taxes are matched by their 
employers 
capital gains although higherincome people will pay a tax rate 
of 31 percent on some of their income the top rate applying to 
capital gains which are profits from the sale of stock and other 
investments is 28 percent 
minimum tax this 21 percent levy aimed at ensuring that 
higherincome people pay some tax regardless of how many legitimate 
deductions they have goes up to 24 percent 
earnedincome credit the maximum credit rises to 1192 for a 
onechild family and 1235 for a family with two or more children 
there is a new supplemental credit of up to 357 if a child is 
under the age of 1 and another credit of up to 428 to help 
lowincome families buy health insurance 
energy new tax incentives of about 500 million a year are 
designed to encourage investment in exploration and production of 
oil gas and alternative fuels these include a 15 percent tax 
credit for costs of expensive oilrecovery techniques and drilling 
when world oil prices drop 
art contributions for 1991 only a highincome person who is 
subject to the minimum tax may donate an artwork to certain 
charities and deduct the full market value rather than just the 
cost

for three years the tobacco lobby has worked 
hard to influence an environmental protection agency report on the 
risks tobacco smoke poses to nonsmokers using the freedom of 
information act the associated press obtained documents that 
reveal details of this classic confrontation between science and 
big business 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
when the environmental protection agency 
convened a panel of scientific experts to rule on whether 
secondhand cigarette smoke causes lung cancer in nonsmokers both 
sides arrived fully armed 
most of the megatonnage belonged to the tobacco industry which 
employed an army of public relations people brandishing bulging 
reports ebutting everything ever said about the dangers of passive 
smoking 
antismoking scientists and activists unable to match the 
industrys fire power relied on carefully timed press releases and 
other surgical strikes 
but this gathering in arlington on dec 45 was just the latest 
most visible battle in a war that had gone on quietly in epa 
offices and lawyers conference rooms for three years 
correspondence and memorandums obtained by the associated press 
under the freedom of information act reveal strenuous efforts by 
the tobacco industry to influence the epa deliberations on 
secondhand smoke 
the stakes were obvious and enormous 
if secondhand smoke is officially listed as a class a 
carcinogen a known cause of human cancer it is the end of 
smoking in any public place said julia carol of americans for 
nonsmokers rights in berkeley calif 
certainly this was an important issue to us said brennan 
dawson a spokeswoman for the tobacco institute the industrys 
trade group in washington dc what we have tried to do is stay 
in the process 
the industry has proven adept at that it has not only been with 
the process but ahead of it 
in october 1987 industry lawyers met with robert axelrad 
director of the epas indoor air division before the epas study 
of passive smoke and cancer had even begun 
they were correctly guessing we might get into tobacco 
smoke said axelrad it was a get acquainted 
in a march 18 1988 letter to the epa samuel chilcote 
president of the tobacco institute laid out the industrys 
position the evidence doesnt show tobacco smoke causes lung 
cancer in nonsmokers 
two years earlier both the us surgeon general and the 
national research council had concluded that passive smoking does 
cause lung cancer the tobacco industry didnt accept the 
conclusions of either report 
chilcote went so far as to suggest the phrasing the epa ought to 
use he warned against the terms passive smoking and 
involuntary smoking 
they could cause confusion and lead to a mistaken view that 
exposure to ets environmental tobacco smoke is in fact 
involuntary smoking chilcote wrote these terms should 
simply be avoided 
the industry also argued that ventilation not restriction of 
smoking is the best way to clear the air 
the epas position is that all indoor air pollutants including 
cigarette smoke are best removed by elimination of the source not 
by ventilation 
the epa said so in letters to the tobacco institute and its 
lawyers the industry repeated its assertions again and again for 
two years 
by june 1989 william rosenberg the epas assistant 
administrator for air and radiation had had enough in a letter to 
a tobacco industry lawyer he criticized the industrys insistence 
that the evidence linking passive smoking to cancer is 
controversial 
the fact of the matter is we find the surgeon general and the 
national research council reports to be highly credible 
rosenberg wrote 
frankly the tobacco industrys argument would be more 
credible if it were not so similar to the tobacco industrys 
position on direct smoking despite the estimated 50000 studies 
linking smoking with disease in humans 
the tempo of the exchange between the epa and the industry 
picked up last june a draft copy of the epa report was leaked and 
then officially released to the press unflinchingly it concluded 
that secondhand smoke is a known cause of lung cancer 
the industry stepped up its lobbying when the epa appointed the 
panel of scientific experts that would meet in arlington the 
industry worked ard for the dismissal of dr david burns the 
senior editor of the surgeon generals report on passive smoking 
the effort succeeded but not for long when word of his 
dismissal got out burns was reappointed 
us rep thomas bliley of richmond va where philip morris 
is the largest private employer took up the industry cause 
he wrote to the epa to say that the reappointment of burns 
raises serious questions about the overall integrity of the 
selection process 
the charge was that burns was an activist and therefore 
couldnt be impartial burns denied the charge and many other 
scientists said he was one of the nations leading authorities on 
the subject of passive smoking 
subsequent news reports revealed that six of the 16 scientists 
on the panel had ties to a tobacco industry research organization 
one of the six was also negotiating for a 12 million research 
grant from philip morris while serving on the epa panel a seventh 
was recommended by the tobacco industry 
the loudest outcry over those revelations didnt come from 
antismoking activists it came from bliley the industry ally 
the selection process has become so deeply enmeshed in 
political and media controversy that an objective review by the 
present panel is no longer possible he wrote on nov 23 he 
urged the epa to select a new expert panel a move that would have 
delayed completion of the final epa report 
the entire process has drawn criticism from all sides its 
not the first time the industry has tried to influence science 
said dr alan blum the founder of doctors ought to care an 
antismoking group 
he said he was puzzled by the publics apparent lack of concern 
if the toxic waste people tried to do something like this they 
would be blasted by everyone in the country when the tobacco 
industry does it we look at it as business as usual 
dawson of the tobacco institute blamed the disruption of the 
scientific process on antismoking advocates there has been a 
lot of involvement by the antismoking community that we dont 
think should be there she said if youre going to pursue 
science it ought to be without advocacy 
we dont have lobbyists everywhere protested carol at 
americans for nonsmokers rights we have not felt that it was 
our business to tell the epa what the science is

cmdr william booth said the numbers are deceptive because 
police today can better identify gang members and investigators 
are more likely to call a murder gangrelated than they were in the 
past even so gang violence is increasing he said 
they have the weapons and they have the mobility plus they 
simply have little reverence for human life somebody elses 
life booth said its almost an animal kind of syndrome that 
prevails with the gang mentality 
the stories behind the statistics illustrate the heartbreak and 
terror of gang violence 
a 5yearold south los angeles girl was killed by a stray 
bullet as she joined friends to sing happy birthday at a party 
in eastern los angeles county albert domingo simenia 36 was 
fatally stabbed while battling eight gang members in his front 
yard 
in suburban la puente worried school officials canceled a 
high school football game following 16 gangrelated shootings in 
two weeks 
fourteen people including two toddlers were wounded in a 
nov 30 driveby attack during a family party in valinda 
the carnage has overshadowed the success of an antigang pilot 
program in a south los angeles area controlled by the crips and 
bloods two predominantly black gangs 
the violence is not even personal said the rev gregory 
boyle a roman catholic priest who has buried 10 gang members this 
year from his east los angeles parish the war were having right 
now there are even brothers flesh and blood brothers on 
different sides 
police most often blame the increased violence on easytoget 
weapons and the release of hundreds of older latino gang members 
imprisoned since the mid1980s 
youth workers however say an influx of central american 
immigrants has changed the nature of hispanic gangs traditional 
neighborhood gangs that fought over neighborhood boundaries are 
giving way to more pragmatic groups trafficking in drugs and 
prostitution said steve valdivia director of community youth gang 
services 
in the latino community the warriors have changed but the 
war goes on valdivia said 
it has a direct correlation with the political and economic 
upheaval in other countries a lot of them come over with a violent 
history the law enforcement here is no match for what they saw 
over there over there the police cut off an arm or slit your 
throat here they put you in jail and feed you well he said 
but others argue that police have been too heavyhanded in 
dealing with gangs as the violence increases so has the criticism 
of the rough shakedowns and neighborhood sweeps that have been law 
enforcements primary tool 
police themselves are saying that social programs are needed to 
turn youths away from gangs 
were arresting more people were prosecuting more people 
said sheriff sherman block the problem is the law enforcement 
workload continues to grow because of failures in other 
institutions were talking about school dropout rates alternative 
programs that will offer the same kind of need satisfaction that 
the gangs offer 
of the estimated 100000 gang members in los angeles county 5 
percent to 8 percent are hopetodie killercriminals who 
should be in jail valdivia said the rest he said probably can 
be turned away from gangs if they realize there is an alternative 
the same things work in any community those are prevention 
mobilization community action and law enforcement opportunity is 
a nice thing to throw in also he said youd be surprised how 
people behave when you treat them as human beings 
valdivia said a onetwo punch of tough law enforcement and 
social programs reduced violence in two south los angeles 
neighborhoods which until last year had been the nations worst 
for gang violence 
while police confronted gang members in the streets youth gang 
services organized basketball and softball leagues and offered 
classes to teach young people how to prepare for job interviews 
parttime jobs were offered through the department of public works 
as a result the southeast precinct reported just 17 
gangrelated homicides during the first eight months of 1990 
compared to 39 the previous year in the 77th precinct 
gangrelated killings dropped from 42 to 27 according to police 
statistics 
folks will tell you theres a different feeling said 
charles norman youth services director in the southeast precinct 
if we can do this the negative element is just going to move 
on 
norman said some youths joined gangs to avoid becoming their 
prey 
take away the jungle atmosphere most kids wont join a gang 
they dont need it he said 
but for those already in a gang loyalties run deep nightowl 
said police crackdowns just make them deeper 
he said authorities would stand a better chance of staunching 
the bloodshed by providing educational opportunities and jobs 
like most of the locos nightowl is a high school dropout 
steady jobs are hard to find 
the teenager whose father also was a gang member soon will 
become a father himself the cycle he said is tough to break 
you know what scares me most is the thought that my little 
kid is going to grow up and be a gang member he said it 
scares the hell out of me but you know what can you do about 
it

in a neighborhood numbed by murderous gang 
warfare the rev gregory boyle battles the violence with what he 
considers the voice of reason and the love of god 
since arriving at the dolores mission five years ago boyle has 
persuaded mothers to take guns away from their gangmember sons and 
coaxed dozens of gang members to attend the missions alternative 
high school 
but in gaining the trust of young gangsters boyle has roused 
the suspicion of police who say his openarms approach gives the 
gangs legitimacy they dont deserve 
boyle in turn has become a sharp critic of antigang 
strategies that rely on force and intimidation 
the image for me always is symptom vs problem said boyle 
the police dont have a clue to what the problem is so what hope 
do we have that they will be part of the solution the problem is 
dysfunctional families and poverty and boredom and jobs you 
address that and the gang mess will dry up 
a los angeles native boyle 36 was ordained to the jesuit 
order in 1984 after graduating from the weston school of theology 
in boston he spent the next year working in an impoverished 
village in the bolivian highlands where he was converted to 
religious activism 
when boyle arrived at dolores he began searching for a solution 
to the bloody warfare waged by 11 gangs that operate in the parish 
soon he decided he could accomplish more by working with the gangs 
instead of against them 
it is a strategy police dislike capt bob medina commander of 
the los angeles police departments hollenbeck division said boyle 
has undermined police efforts to convince young people that gang 
membership in itself is bad 
he permits them to congregate over there to wear their 
colors i think thats contrary to what were trying to do 
medina said were trying to dissuade youngsters from joining 
gangs the actions he has taken gives them some credibility and 
makes them proud to be in gangs 
boyle turned dolores mission a parish church and school about 
two miles east of downtown los angeles into a sort of nomans 
land where gang members are welcome to congregate provided they 
leave weapons drugs and liquor outside 
boyle acknowleded his strategy hasnt stopped the killing so 
far this year he has buried 10 gang members and attended services 
for even more 
but he points out that more than a decade of aggressive police 
crackdowns has failed to stem a steady increase in violence 
during 1990 gang killings have increased more than 30 percent 
in the hollenbeck division which includes boyles parish 
according to police statistics overall gangrelated violence in 
the area is up more than 50 percent 
boyle blames the carnage on poverty and despair in his parish 
a mostly hispanic area of public housing projects and aging 
woodframe houses jobs are scarce and teens frequently drop out of 
high school long before graduation 
its all despair so threats of any kind all those things 
that would work in someone who cared it doesnt cut it for kids 
who dont have a sense of hope for a better future boyle said 
earlier this year medina asked boyles superiors in san 
francisco to transfer the priest out of east los angeles church 
officials declined medina said since then archbishop roger 
mahony in los angeles has reaffirmed his support for boyles 
campaign 
boyle said that so far he has been unable to achieve one of his 
major goals to arrange a lasting ceasefire among warring gangs 
but at times his approach pays off 
last summer boyle found temporary jobs for about 40 gang 
members so long as they were working they refrained from 
gangbangings or launching attacks on rival bands he said 
several gang members interviewed in the missions small 
recreation room said there was less temptation to fight when they 
were employed 
when you get a job you change because youre making money you 
can go places you dont have to stay around here said one gang 
member who refused to give his name you dont have to steal you 
dont have to sell dope you got a job it does change a lot of 
people 
boyle said he believes his approach despising the sin but not 
the sinner will work in the long run but that is not why he 
employs it 
the stand this church has to gang members is what jesus would 
do that its morally correct and based on the gospel he said 
to work with them and find jobs for them and lovingly accept them 
is what jesus would do whether any of that works is not my 
concern i think it works but thats not the point

babies sell like pretty girls they are used to 
peddle everything from suntan oil to automobile tires in tv 
commercials but capturing those few seconds of charm can be a 
nightmare for the directors and cameramen heres a peep behind the 
scenes at a shooting 
 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the meter is running clicking off thousands of 
dollars an hour in expenses 
camera crews and lighting technicians dawdle the standins the 
mothers the baby handler the attending nurse are transfixed the 
advertising man paces the directors anxious eyes flit from his 
watch to the nondeveloping scenario before him 
center stage is the star a baby 
they are probably the most difficult commercials ive ever 
shot says mike rogers senior vice president to the creative 
director for ddbneedham he handles tire commercials 
nonetheless babies are great for the advertising business no 
one can say how many commercials babies make or what percentage of 
the business infants command but they sell 
from the time the puppy tried to pull a tykes bathing suit down 
in the ads for suntan oil to todays tiny tots with adult voices 
talking about fastfood restaurants they are a sure vehicle for 
merchandising 
john hicks has a company called baby wranglers that casts 
babies maybe its just the innocence he says theres a 
vulnerability and theres an exuberance i dont want to get too 
philosophical about it but i do think were living in a pretty 
jaded world and when we see something like that it attracts you 
it may attract the viewer but it is a major headache for the 
adults who do the filming 
youre helpless rogers says you go through a lot of 
nailbiting and hairpulling because there is absolutely nothing 
you can do you can do everything possible to create an environment 
and cast the right baby but if that baby isnt feeling well or is 
a little bit cranky youre out of luck 
never mind that there are seven standin babies waiting in the 
wings 
a baby might be cast in the morning and is fine in the morning 
but when it comes to shooting the scene it is afternoon and maybe 
that baby is not an afternoon baby 
you have a baby you want to use and hell come to the set 
that morning with a rash rogers frets or at some point in a 
production schedule youll say bring that baby in and youll find 
out all of a sudden she has a cut lip because she was playing with 
a toy 
one commercial for michelin tires started with a hand drawn 
pinup of a bigeared baby in a tire and a line so much is riding 
on your tires the campaign has been running six years now much 
longer than normal gone through some 40 babies and still garners 
awards at the same rate as it did the first year more than 30 in 
all 
theres great money in it for the babies too if they hit get 
on air last a while otherwise they make the screen actors guild 
minimum of about 265 a day which barely pays for the gas and the 
wearandtear on mother 
if the commercial goes through the cycle then the baby stands 
to make 6000 to 10000 
there are instances of babies making much more kathy jennings 
hicks partner cites the case of a baby who worked maybe five 
minutes and made 40000 
then there was another case of a baby who was chosen to be the 
spokesbaby for a certain product the baby was put on a retainer 
nobody took into consideration that babies change both 
physically and temperamentally jennings says so by the time 
they went to film a second commercial not only didnt the baby 
look the same the baby wasnt temperamentally suited they tried 
a second baby and then dumped the commercial 
but the first baby worked two days and made 60000 
hicks is a whirlwind of action during the casting call what 
actors call the cattle call running out of the audition room to 
give a baby back to mother running back with another putting the 
baby on the mat with a bunch of toys playing peekaboo making 
strange noises blowing bubbles

he may seem quite mad but he is carefully assessing this baby 
measuring attention span independence good humor energy level 
he will see 150 babies a day cut the lot to some 30 three will 
eventually be chosen the star and two standins 
he meets one mother in the waiting room she hands the baby over 
to him and the baby cries he hands the baby back says the baby is 
lovely but a little nervous today the mother cries 
she knows its over and she wanted another try hicks says 
i was trying to be real nice and you have to try to explain that 
if i brought the baby into the audition room id only be appeasing 
them i know they have unrealistic expectations they drove a long 
way and i feel bad for them 
one of the toughest things we have to do is to hand a baby 
over to an actor or an actress hicks adds in an audition all 
i have to do is get a baby to perform and they can do some pretty 
amazing things but when i have to hand that baby to an actor or an 
actress ive lost control and its unnerving 
an actor may be able to fool the creative execs but he cant 
fool the baby the baby can tell by the touch its instinctual 
and the kid will scream its the best alarm system for bad acting 
youll ever find 
hicks remembers one commercial involving three babies in 
costume one of whom kept falling asleep then someone got the 
bright idea of putting a pair of sunglasses on the dozing child and 
it actually added to the commercials charm 
one of the toughest commercials we did was with a tire covered 
with a blanket rogers says 
they wanted a baby to walk up to the covered tire stand there a 
couple of seconds and then whip off the blanket and they wanted 
to shoot it in one take when you want a baby to do something 
thats what they wont do rogers says we couldnt get a baby 
to do it theyd walk in take a few steps then crawl and crawl 
right past the tire 
finally on one of the last shots of the day one of the babies 
did it perfectly 
one commercial will linger in mike rogers memory forever 
the commercial was to feature a baby in a tire and a dog sitting 
next to him the dog was to get up walk offstage and return with a 
puppy held by the scruff of his neck the dog would deposit the 
puppy in the tire next to the baby 
but the crew worried over the safety of the baby you cant 
control the little puppy and we were all concerned it would bite 
the baby rogers says 
so they put up a partition which the camera could not see 
between the baby and the puppy the dog dutifully dropped the puppy 
into its compartment in the tire then rogers says the 
unexpected 
the baby reached over picked it up and started to bite the 
puppy

recycler warner bros zz top 
 
billy gibbons dusty hill and frank beard still are mining the 
old boogie rock to which they first staked their claim to stardom 
more than 10 years ago 
and it still works the style wears as well as a pair of boots 
that never seem too tired for another stomp around the dance floor 
the texas trio owe their durability partly to their choice of 
classic timetested rhythms but just as much to their ability to 
keep their locomotivelike sound fully stoked and running at full 
tilt 
there are no surprises on recycler just another heaping 
helping of what zz top fans have come to expect from the biggest 
little band in texas

ragged glory reprise neil young and crazy horse 
 
neil young continues to change musical personae more often than 
most guitarists change strings 
youngs 25album catalog includes country rockabilly synthpop 
and some of the most beautiful ballads of his generation but 
ragged glory as the title would suggest is an hour of rock 
n roll as only young can play it 
paired with crazy horse a threepiece band that has 
intermittently backed him since 1969 young delivers a raw 
scorching set dominated by guitar solos 
he draws from an immense vocabulary of riffs built up over two 
decades the fretboard workout includes crunching chords ringing 
melodies bent notes and feedback occasionally the energy flags 
when a break runs a little long four of the 10 songs clock in at 
more than seven minutes but youngs playing never sounds 
methodical 
the garageband sound is matched with lyrics that have this 
child of the 60s sounding nostalgic theres a mansion on the 
hill young sings psychedelic music fills the air peace and 
love live there still theres a mansion on the hill 
even when waxing sentimental young sings with the energy of a 
teenager his casual relationship with the proper key is 
dylanesque and he doesnt think twice about roaming an octave 
above his range 
ragged glory is a stark contrast to youngs marvelous 1989 
album freedom which contains angry more polished music but 
if you need a guitar fix this neils for you

shyness admits she was scared to death at her first meeting with 
weir i wanted to do this film so badly and i wanted to make the 
proper impression any time you want to make the proper impression 
you usually dont she said with a laugh 
i left that meeting going over every word that i had uttered 
every movement that i had made i guess it worked i got the job 
her first meeting with depardieu was easier gerard said in an 
interview that i was nervous and i was i was more nervous meeting 
with peter than with gerard hes very charming you know and you 
can see immediately how easy and comfortable he is with himself 
about the language problem i can get by in french i would 
say that gerard speaks better english than i speak french we did 
all right a lot of times he would speak french to me because i 
can understand it peter speaks perfect french 
andie macdowell was born in the small mill town of gaffney 
sc and grew up on both sides of the border between the 
carolinas the urge to act came early 
even as a child i loved to entertain i loved to make people 
laugh i used to put on shows in my garage i danced in front of 
the tv look at me look at me a little bit of a ham i guess 
i did theater when i was in college she said 
my mother who is no longer alive was very happy that i 
wanted to act and she gave me great confidence she sustained me 
my father i think at the beginning was a bit frightened only 
because of the possibility of danger that i was going to the big 
city he had plans for his daughter he wanted me to be a nurse 
get my education marry a doctor and have children now he seems 
very proud that im happy 
macdowell did go to the big city where she studied in a 
repertory theater playing jane to lamberts tarzan seemed like a 
starmaking turn but it wasnt her only memorable role afterward 
was an unobtainable love in the yuppie melodrama st elmos 
fire then came sex lies and videotape in which she played 
the frustrated wife of a philandering husband 
i would say it was the beginning of my career she 
commented i didnt know how it would turn out it was such a 
lowbudget film with a new director stephen soderbergh when i 
met him i had complete trust in him 
but you just dont know it might get made and never 
distributed that was my fear i thought i would have something on 
tape to show casting directors what i was capable of i knew that i 
finally had a role that i could do very well 
i had confidence in myself as far as the role i didnt think 
that anybody knew her as well as i knew her it touched me in a 
very deep place 
she feared that people might be narrowminded about the films 
explicit talk not until sex lies won first prize at the park 
city film festival did she think that it might be distributed after 
all then it won big at cannes and she thought well it really 
will get distributed 
macdowell lives with her husband paul qualley and their two 
children in a farmhouse outside new york city i wanted to move 
further into the country and live on a farm she said but this 
career has sort of taken over my life this year i lived in 
budapest and rome and london and new york i did three films 
i dont think i plan to do three films next year after so 
many years of wanting to do good work to all of a sudden have the 
opportunity to work on three such interesting and different 
projects it was too tempting to pass up i hope i dont do that 
again

the lone star brewery folks surely never 
would have imagined it 
their beer factory the biggest in texas when it opened more 
than a century ago is a cozy museum these days commanding the 
attention of art experts worldwide 
just a decade old the san antonio museum of art is creating a 
noticeable niche for itself with a collection of greek and roman 
antiquities a burgeoning egyptian art display and a big mexican 
visiting art show 
weve received very high praise from our colleagues both here 
and abroad said gerry scott the museums ancient art curator 
people came through and said my goodness look what you have 
here in san antonio 
the current cheers are for the museums ewing halsell wing for 
ancient art unveiled in november with much fanfare and a symposium 
by appreciative experts 
among those attending were former san antonio antiquities 
curator carlos picon now with the metropolitan museum of art in 
new york cornelius vermeule of the museum of fine arts in boston 
marion true of the j paul getty museum in california and dietrich 
wildung director of the egyptian museum in berlin 
the new wing features the arnold and marie smith schwartz 
gallery for ancient glass the estelle blackburn gallery of greek 
and roman decorative arts and the gilbert denman gallery for 
ancient sculpture 
though some pieces are on loan most come from an extensive 1986 
donation by denman and the museums acquisition of the 
starkwillson antiquities collection 
a highlight of the antiquities collection is an eightfoot 
marble sculpture of the roman emperor and philosopher marcus 
aurelius dating to 140 ad excavated in 1771 it reveals the trend 
of that time replacing pieces missing from the original 
the sleeping ariadne a roman sculpture copying a greek 
original dating from the 2nd century ad once was in a private 
collection in england its history is traceable to the 1600s 
the roman deer hunter sarcophagus a marble case for burying 
the dead dates from the 2nd century and features intricate 
carvings 
a sculpture not on display also has generated news 
connoisseur magazine reported this fall that a roman sculpture 
of a woman was smuggled out of turkey along with a handful of 
other art objects and allegedly ended up at the san antonio museum 
of art 
museum officials contend the article was sensational and 
insist no evidence has been found that the museums 8foot statue 
was illegally brought into the country 
the museum is cooperating with the us customs service and the 
us attorneys office in an investigation scott said the statue 
lent by an anonymous donor was noticeably absent when the 
antiquities exhibit opened 
we didnt want to have a situation where people were coming in 
simply to see that sculpture and missing the other 96 pieces 
scott said 
he added that its size would have made it more difficult to 
remove and return to the owner and said its period in art history 
already was represented in the exhibit 
the denman gallery pieces range from the 6th century bc to the 
3rd century ad while the blackburn gallerys pottery and vases 
demonstrate the development of decorative arts in the classical 
period from 2000 bc to 300 bc 
the schwartz gallery described as one of the top six nationwide 
devoted to ancient glass shows the development of glass from early 
stages in the near east through later roman and islamic periods 
while the antiquities collection has been praised for its range 
the museum isnt claiming to rival the encyclopedic collections 
of the boston museum of fine arts or new yorks metropolitan museum 
of art 
boston and the metropolitan both opened their doors in 1870 
so they had plenty of years of collecting on us scott said 
adding that the advantage of the san antonio collection is its 
human scale 
the antiquities collection isnt all thats publicizing the 
museum which previously was best known for its folk art 
collection 
it is one of three nationwide playing host to mexico 
splendors of thirty centuries the exhibit will be here four 
months between stops in new york and los angeles and will be 
greeted in san antonio by mexican president carlos salinas de 
gortari the week of its april 4 opening 
the exhibit will occupy 25000 square feet and construction 
workers are busy renovating another building of the old brewery to 
accommodate it two galleries of egyptian art adjoining the new 
halsell wing also will close temporarily to make room for the 
mexican show 
scott said the museums antiquities collection is what attracted 
him to san antonio this year after earning his doctorate at yale 
university working in two yale art museums and working at a 
development company on grant writing 
as an egyptologist scott said he was thrilled with the 
challenge of helping to build an egyptian art collection 
i believe that the museum itself while its made tremendous 
progress in the last 10 years is poised to make some tremendous 
leaps forward he said

the secret is out and remember that you heard it 
here first arlo guthrie never really wanted to be a folk singer 
forget for a moment that hes the son of woody guthrie who 
wrote more than 1000 songs or that hes written a sizable number 
of memorable tunes himself forget all those great interpretations 
of goodnight irene amazing grace stealin and this 
land is your land that youve heard him do over the years dont 
even think about alices restaurant that epic tale of youthful 
rebellion and antiwar protest 
what arlo guthrie really wanted to be was a newspaper reporter 
yeah there must be a repressed reporter in one of my hidden 
personalities because i love to write laughs guthrie whose 
musical career has seen him evolve from the 60skid protest singer 
with a sense of humor to one of the preeminent voices in american 
folk music 
but he says i didnt become a folk singer because i wanted to 
be i ended up doing this because i didnt know how to do anything 
else 
and that hasnt changed much he adds with that quick 
goodnatured laugh that his fans have heard so often over the 
years its the one that sometimes surfaces right on stage in the 
middle of a song when something strikes him so funny that he has 
to stop and tell everyone about it 
but now the funny stories the wry asides the general 
observations on the oddities of life are as apt to go down on paper 
as over a microphone in a concert hall 
the ones that are written go into guthries newsletter the 
rolling blunder review an espistle written in a style that evokes 
rollicking images of the kind of oldtime journalism chronicled in 
such movies as the front page 
but the newsletter never started out to be a newsletter 
it sort of came about by accident guthrie says 
in the mid70s he began collecting addresses of people who 
might want a schedule of his shows but he never really got around 
to sending them one 
people started asking us when are you going to send us 
something theyd say i signed up 14 times and i never got 
anything he recalled 
so with a great sense of guilt the rolling blunder review was 
born guthrie and his wife jackie typed it on a single sheet of 
paper made copies and mailed it from their home in washington 
mass early issues contained only the longsought schedule and a 
few funny comments on alices restaurant and other songs 
but as word spread the newsletter grew five years later its 
an eightpage quarterly containing stories letters to the editor 
and information on how to buy guthries albums tshirts and other 
merchandise theres even a cooking column by alice brock you 
remember alice theres a song about alice 
some 60000 to 70000 people pay 3 a year for it although it 
goes free to people in hospitals and prisons 
among the stories in recent issues are reports on concerts to 
benefit the environment and in support of student protests in china 
and elsewhere but somehow almost everything no matter how 
serious comes out funny sort of like an arlo guthrie concert 
he notes that one role of a folk singer is to comment on 
political events of the day as his father pete seeger joan baez 
and so many others have done 
but its not the only job and it may not even be the most 
important job he said the most important thing for me 
personally is maintaining a sense of humor in an oftenhumorless 
world 
for guthrie the laughs have been frequent only he for 
example could show us in alices restaurant how to use a 
litterbug arrest as a reason to stay out of the army during the 
vietnam war only he has dared speculate in the pause of mr 
claus that santa claus might enter houses late at night because 
hes a dope fiend or that a delightful folk ditty about the joys 
of tilling the earth the garden song should be played 
backward in search of evil messages 
the laughs have been so frequent that theyve allowed some to 
overlook the musical talent guthrie is more than proficient on 
guitar piano harmonica and banjo as well as a singer of some 
range and a writer whose best songs evoke strong images of joy and 
sometimes sorrow 
alices restaurant started it all in 1967 making him an 
overnight star at age 20 
who could have ever imagined it he says of the way the 
youth culture embraced his 18minute guitaraccompanied monologue 
on how he used a thanksgiving day arrest to stay out of the army 
the song also helped him escape early comparisons with a legendary 
father 
and although guthrie has almost always included a woody guthrie 
song or two in his concert repertoire he downplays the fatherson 
connection 
for whatever cosmic reasons and who really understands those 
things i ended up similar to my dad in some ways he says 
but were vastly different in other ways 
but the connection also brings up another inevitable question 
woody guthrie died in 1967 of the debilitating neurological 
disorder huntingtons chorea it has a 5050 chance of being passed 
from parent to child it strikes in middle age and arlo guthrie is 
43 
but he dismisses such inquiries goodnaturedly im not dead 
yet he says does that answer your question 
he is also not through working yet continuing to tour regularly 
and making plans to record again after several years without a new 
album 
ive written some new songs he says ive got enough for 
a totally new record 
hes also thinking about an animated version for children of 
alices restaurant which was made into a movie in 1969 
it would focus more on the thanksgiving part and less on the 
littering and draft parts he says 
he notes that the idea of dumping a half a ton of garbage by 
the side of the road isnt as popular as it once was even if the 
dump was closed on thanksgiving and youd never heard of a dump 
closed on thanksgiving before 
littering isnt such a good idea anymore he says a bit 
sheepishly but then he adds with that quick laugh i sure had a 
lot of fun on that day though

after four novels polite reviews and paltry 
sales as byatt has emerged from the shadow of her younger more 
prolific sister novelist margaret drabble 
byatts fifth and latest novel possession scooped up 
britains and irelands top literary awards and the hefty hardback 
sold strongly leading up to christmas 
but the 54yearold author is taking fame and fortune in stride 
im too old to get awfully changed yet young enough to enjoy 
it byatt said in an interview 
she has however become more wary when possession began 
collecting rave reviews she welcomed journalists into her home 
but after a catty comment or two about her housekeeping appeared in 
print she insists on doing interviews by telephone 
some of the 39200 from the british booker prize and the 
45000 from the irish timesaer lingus international fiction prize 
have been spent on a few good suits and a london taxicab account 
the remainder will build a swimming pool at the authors house in 
southern france and maybe buy a couple of pairs of shoes 
possession in the tradition of john fowles french 
lieutenants woman intertwines past and present a modern 
romance grows as two literary scholars discover through poetry and 
fragments of letters an unknown relationship between two victorian 
poets 
in her previous novels byatt worked with material from her own 
life 
it was a sort of pleasure not writing realistically about 
anything i had actually experienced or knew the 19th century i 
had to invent she said 
antonia susan byatt was born in 1936 into the puritannical 
household of a yorkshire judge john drabble she went to a quaker 
school then to cambridge where she graduated with honors she 
earned a masters degree at bryn mawr college in pennsylvania 
i was very unhappy there i wanted something different and 
got more of the same i thought america would be big and modern 
with chrome on everything moving at twice the speed instead i was 
in a victorian building and a victorian library with not a man in 
sight she said 
byatt taught american and english literature including 
victorian poetry at university college in london until 1983 when 
she quit to write full time 
thirty years years ago she gave the name antonia to her first 
daughter and began calling herself as byatt 
when i had my first child i was in a fit of despair i was 23 
and i thought she had better have this good name antonia and 
carry it on for i shall never write a book byatt said 
she and her first husband ian byatt also had a son who was 
killed in an accident at age 11 she and her second husband 
investment adviser peter duffy have two daughters 
byatt published her first novel in 1964 and three more 
followed she also wrote a critical study of william wordsworth and 
samuel taylor coleridge and another on novelist iris murdoch and 
edited george eliots the mill on the floss 
but it wasnt until her daughters had grown and she had 
foresaken academia that she wrote possession with its strong 
plot line and sexual tension 
i had a very puritanical background and was taught to think 
very hard about what was valuable in life and from that background 
novels arent very valuable at all she said 
its difficult to try and put anything first if you have 
children and until recently i wasnt at all quite sure that i 
could put it first 
the author said her american publishers random house were 
concerned that possession at 511 pages and more than 1700 
lines of victorian poetry would be too academic for a broad 
audience 
people have made too much out of the fact that im an 
academic i am an artist not a career academic but because i 
talk about things as one knows things people assume i am trying to 
impress 
that impulse showed in her fourth novel still life 
published in 1985 about a playwright who becomes absorbed in his 
subject the painter vincent van gogh 
you couldnt do it without doing the research so i read the 
letters just reading a biography doesnt do it byatt said she 
also went to amsterdam to study his paintings 
van gogh appealed to byatt because of their mutual passion for 
light she suffers from seasonally adjusted depression and must 
sit in front of a bright light during winter 
he is a paradigm of myself i am obsessed with the sun and in 
the south i start going too fast when i am slightly on the edge of 
being mad i get terribly speeded up like him i know what he feels 
like she said 
after years of comparisons with her younger sister byatt shrugs 
off the reports of antagonism between the two 
we get on fine we dont see each other much and we dont look 
for the worst in each other byatt said she lives in cozy putney 
in south london while her sister settled in tony hampstead to the 
north 
critics lazily tended to compare the two sisters byatt said 
when there are other writers more interesting to be compared to 
i dont mind being compared to iris murdoch i learned a lot 
from her and i admire her

sonny lemaire of the band exile figures 
no one can match the groups diversity as an opening concert act 
weve opened up for aerosmith and george jones he says i 
dont think anybody in music can lay claim to that kind of 
pedigree 
twelve years ago the band hit the top of the rock n roll 
charts with kiss you all over a 1978 flash in the pan that 
sold 5 million copies thats when the group did concerts with 
arrowsmith six years later the band developed a growing following 
as a sizzling country music group with soaring harmonies and superb 
instrumentation 
it was the period in which the group opened concerts for jones 
a country music legend 
weve got a vault full of experiences lemaire says its 
been amazing i ought to write a book about it 
however theres little time to write a book the fivemember 
group sidetracked in the past two years by the departure of three 
members and the loss of a recording contract is back with renewed 
enthusiasm 
with two replacements on board and a third coming in soon exile 
has rejoined the ranks of country music kingpins 
weve let people know that exile never left and were back 
stronger than ever lemaire said 
the group put out no new songs for about two years until 
mid1990 this followed the loss of their recording contract and 
the disruption caused by the departure of marlin hargis jp 
pennington and les taylor who are now working independently in 
music 
but exile signed with arista records and filled the vacancies in 
the band with lee carroll paul martin and mark jones 
their comeback album still standing has produced two top 
10 country hits yet and nobodys talking 
this album should be multiplatinum millions sold lemaire 
said id put it up against any of the others song for song 
exile of lexington ky became a sensation when the 
littleknown band released the controversial kiss you all over 
after followup rock n roll records fizzled the group returned 
to lexington and began playing regularly in a bowling alley lounge 
lemaire even took a job in a pizza restaurant because he needed 
money 
it was a real difficult time i cooked the pizzas and made the 
strombolis he said 
at the bowling alley exile began perfecting a country sound 
that earned them a recording contract with epic records in the 
mid1980s they were a dominant country band with an impressive 
list of no 1 records woke up in love give me one more 
chance crazy for your love shes a miracle hang on 
to your heart i could get used to you and shes too good 
to be true 
exile has been around for 26 years and the three new members 
are the 19th 20th and 21st to join 
its been cycle after cycle said lemaire now the groups 
bassist and lead vocalist you get up and then youre down for a 
while and then you find some way to bring it back 
no one promises you if you want to be in music that its 
going to be an easy ride because its not its difficult but 
gratifying if you achieve any success at all 
lemaire said hes never considered kiss you all over 
offensive even though some radio stations refused to play it 
because of the suggestive title 
the only thing that disturbs me is that the band is remembered 
for that song only he said 
exile he says has a lot more to offer good songs good 
playing good harmony and a tremendous live show

the disposition of an individuals estate need not 
be a guessing game 
yet many people are unaware that by establishing a sound estate 
plan they easily may shelter many holdings from probate still more 
dont know the principles behind assessing their estate but by 
better understanding how the federal government governs estate 
taxes people may avoid or reduce the future federal tax 
liabilities 
this tax savings can preserve assets in the estate that 
otherwise might be used to pay death taxes these assets then may 
be passed on to a spouse children or charity 
there are several steps to take in evaluating your estate 
first determine the nature and the value of your estates assets 
assts may include your residence other property such as a 
vacation home household furnishings savings bonds stocks 
checking and savings accounts pension benefits life insurance 
policies automobiles 
for federal tax purposes there are several exceptions to 
determining the value of an asset 
for jointly owned assets held by spouses only half the value 
of the asset is included in your estate if you are the first spouse 
to die 
for life insurance policies the amount included in your 
estate is the face amount of the policy rather than its replacement 
cost or present cash value if whole life at the date of your 
death 
if you die before retirement you receive none of your 
pension however half the value of the pension is payable to your 
spouse and half the vested plan benefits what would have been 
available to you had you lived to retirement are included in your 
gross estate 
finally series ee bonds are included at their present value 
when they mature 
all other assets generally are included at fair market value 
second determine your deductions when calculating federal 
estate tax include funeral expenses costs of the last illness of 
the decendent if applicable unpaid debts and mortgages and 
administrative expenses for the estate 
youll incur fewer administrative expenses for assets 
transferred outside of the probate to avoid probate you may set 
up a living trust although it will create some trust 
administration costs 
in addition property held in joint tenancy with right of 
survivorship automatically passes to the surviving joint tenant 
outside the probate process other property of a contractual nature 
such as life insurance policies or qualified pension plans also 
will transfer to the beneficiary outside of probate 
step three determine which property qualifies for the marital 
deduction or charitable deduction three factors make a difference 
if your will transfers property to your spouse this property 
qualifies for the marital deduction 
if any property is held in joint tenancy with right of 
survivorship the property passes to the surviving spouse and 
qualifies for the marital deduction 
if any life insurance or qualified pension plan names your 
spouse as policy beneficiary or plan benificiary this too 
qualifies 
the same kinds of arrangements will qualify property for the 
charitable estate tax deduction if property is left to the charity 
as a result of a will a specific property designation such as a 
joint tenancy or a contractual benificiary designation 
any property qualifying for the marital deduction or the 
charitable deduction is not subject to federal estate tax 
liability remaining property is referred to as the taxable estate 
the fourth and final step is to determine estimated federal 
tax liability on the taxable estate the unified estate and gift 
transfer tax rates apply to the taxable estate when calculating the 
amount of federal estate tax 
every individual regardless of the size of his or her estate 
is entitled to a unified credit of 192800 that absorbs dollar 
for dollar the amount of that individuals federal estate tax 
liability up to that amount this assumes that you did not make any 
lifetime gifts to an individual in any one year while alive that 
exceeded the amount of the gift tax annual exclusion amount of 
10000 
here a rule of thumb applies for your federal estate tax 
liability to be greater than 192800 your taxable estate must be 
greater than 600000 
as long as a husband and wife each hold 600000 in separately 
owned assets the couple can own a total of 12 million in assets 
and the entire amount for both estates avoids federal estate tax 
liability the process of rearranging property ownership for estate 
assets so that each spouses estate takes maximum advantage is 
known as estate equalization 
many people assume they wont have assets exceeding 600000 
but in these days of appreciated home values and sizable pension 
plans or life insurance policies estates are often of surprising 
size

estate planning division of the college for financial planning in

carefully kept records of triumphs mistakes and 
possibilities for better things may be the easiest way to 
greenthumb results in gardening and the start of the new year is 
perfect for launching such record keeping or improving the present 
system 
for years i used a dozen 10by12inch envelopes labeled by 
the month to accumulate notes things like the queen sophia 
marigolds started in april did better than those started a month or 
so later 
placed in the april envelope this was a memoryjogger the 
following april to plant queen sophia seeds as soon as possible 
this system worked well but since retiring i switched to a computer 
and if forced to make the choice would rather give up my 
favorite 35yearold shovel 
a neighbor nailed a 3by4foot white cardboard to an inside 
wall of her garage and ruled it off by months now she pencils in 
or erases instructions such as prune the roses under january 
or plant pepper transplants in late february 
another friend can garden mainly on saturdays an engineer he 
built a computer program based on his gardening experiences and 
each friday asks the computer what to do the next day it responds 
with instructions such as sow seeds of chard eggplant leaf 
lettuce radish spinach and tomato 
whether that elaborate or like mine quite simple a computer 
program does a remarkable job in keeping gardening records 
the most detailed ive seen from jeff ball and gary gack is 
distributed by rodale press emmaus pa for ibm computers and 
compatibles it keeps track of available space in the garden 
creates planting and harvesting dates estimates seeds needed 
tells how to thin resulting plants and even provides a way to 
advise the best times to turn the compost pile 
ortho also distributes an interesting commercial program there 
must be others 
information accumulated over the years in my dozen dogeared 
envelopes was entered into an elementary database system known as 
file folders dont let the idea of a database scare you there 
is just one form to handle at a time with blanks to fill in for 
things such as plant name date planted date of first bloom date 
of first harvest merit assessment colors exposure location 
culture tips etc 
my form has nearly 50 permanent entries but rarely are more 
than a dozen or so spaces filled in a given year for any plant so 
that much detail is overkill however a printout will provide a 
composite assessment say of the potatoes tried in the past 10 
years or when the first rose is likely to bloom 
each weekend scatchpaper notes are entered onto each applicable 
form updating records weekly becomes an easy routine 
a couple cautions first the reason for gardening should be to 
relax and enjoy yourself so if the computer becomes work 
reevaluate second be sure the file folder system allows a 
sentence to expand wrap to the next line and doesnt limit 
entries to a certain number of predetermined characters 
my first attempt at computerization limited the space for an 
individual entry and had to be abandoned after a year 
now for example when asked for february weather the print out 
will say water needs increase as temperatures warm and day 
length increases deep infrequent watering is best frost 
precautions will be needed through the first three weeks the 
same question in july will get triple digit all month 
when asked the program will say what vegetables or flowers must 
be planted by midfebruary advise what trees should be fertilized 
in january and how much to apply recommend annuals that produce 
yellow flowers no taller than 24 inches or say that some valencia 
oranges should be ready for harvesting late in february everything 
is based on whats happened in my garden 
too elaborate sure a looseleaf notebook or the old envelope 
system might do as well but the computer is fun keeps everything 
quickly available and updating takes only a few keystrokes 
and keeping adequate records actually simplifies things a few 
years ago tired of hearing that tomatoes cant be grown in this 
desert climate between winters infrequent frost and summers high 
temperatures i experimented with a dozen nationally touted 
varieties they were grown in daylong sun morning sun afternoon 
sun and under a shade screen some were mulched some were staked 
all received the same supplemental irrigation and fertilizer 
clearly superior were celebrity and small fry ive never 
planted any others since as the historians like to say or is it 
the philosophers those who forget the lessons of history are 
doomed to repeat the mistakes

a stroll through the lanes 
of this mountain town is a return to the past neighbors know each 
other and each others business the air is pungent with sweetsour 
drying rice stalks 
the walk also gives a glimpse of japans future more than one 
in four people in minamishinano is 65 or older roughly double the 
national rate in 30 years one in every four japanese will be old 
and the nation will face the struggle to care for them that now is 
confronting this village 
japans rapid industrialization drained the countryside of 
youth most of the people on minamishinanos narrow streets and 
tilling the rice and vegetable fields are elderly 
of the 775 people 65 or older in the village several hundred 
live isolated high on the mountainsides others live along steep 
paths that are treacherous in winter they face a daily struggle to 
bathe and feed themselves 
the struggle to keep up their spirits is even harder 
embarrassed by his failing health an 81yearold widower has 
retreated into his home refusing to talk to neighbors or visit the 
village twice a week fukumi nagusawa visits to cook and clean 
now im the only person hell talk with all day he just lays 
in his bed says mrs nagusawa 35 
an woman in a spotless white apron wanders along the side of 
the road a younger woman at her elbow shes senile she spends 
all day wandering around and her daughterinlaw is with her all 
the time a villager explains 
i live all by myself all alone says one 72yearold 
woman my body aches so badly that sometimes i just want to kill 
myself 
eleven elderly villagers reportedly committed suicide last year 
thirtyfive years ago this village deep in the mountains 100 
miles southwest of tokyo had thriving lumber and silk industries 
and 6563 residents 
but many businesses have closed unable to compete with imports 
hillside homes were abandoned young people headed for japans 
urban areas and the population dwindled to 2882 
by the 1970s the social impact of the drain to the cities hurt 
more than the economic consequences said shousuke sakurai a local 
official in charge of services for the elderly 
we began to notice many social problems old people were 
depressed quite a few committed suicide sakurai said it was 
a very dark time 
looking after his own bedridden mother convinced sakurai the 
community would have to be aggressive five years ago he got 
permission to develop a welfare program aimed at helping older 
residents live comfortably at home 
the village hired four parttime home helpers for housework 
and cooking it also built a center where the villages elderly can 
bathe socialize get medical attention and eat a hot lunch for 3 
one recent day two old men gazed out a window of the centers 
cafeteria at workers building a hostel for bedridden elderly and an 
apartment building for the aged who require little help 
theyre as excited as if theyre watching their own house 
being built sakurai says 
the government plans similar facilities for the entire country 
by the year 2000 there should be 10000 apartment buildings for 
older people no such buildings existed last year 
the government also plans to increase the number of day service 
centers from 1080 in 1989 to 10000 in 2000 and to provide 50000 
hostel beds for short stays up from 4274 last year 
minamishinanos new facilities already are improving life says 
yoko arai one of the centers eight staff members 
before there was nothing for them now many have become much 
more cheerful they sing and dance and make friends for the people 
living off by themselves in the hills its the only chance they 
get to talk she says 
the 18 men and women in the centers sunny activities room were 
chatting playing chess and making handicrafts at other times a 
rehabilitation specialist lectures on posture while explaining the 
sources of various aches and pains 
the elderly have refused to follow their children to the big 
city unwilling to give up their lives amid the mountainsides 
yielding lush crops of rice barley vegetables and fruit living 
space is plentiful air is unpolluted and the village river runs 
fast and clear 
but those attractions are lost on many young people so at a 
time when japan is fighting in international arenas to maintain its 
ban on rice imports the number of farmers who benefit from such 
policy is declining 
in 1965 68000 graduates of high school and college became 
farmers but by 1989 the number was 2100 each year the number of 
farmers who quit far exceeds those who start 
the lack of young successors to continue farming is the single 
biggest problem facing japans farm sector today says munetoshi 
wada an official in the agriculture ministrys successor policy 
division 
special schools and startup grants have done little to persuade 
young japanese to chose farming over whitecollar work wada says 
those who remain traditionally the oldest child inherits the 
home have trouble finding wives few young women welcome the 
burden of farmwork in addition to caring for children husband and 
aging parents 
minamishinano is trying to replace the disintegrating old social 
structure with a new one says iju katamachi an energetic doctor 
who visits five or six homes daily 
he says medicine has made it possible to keep bodies alive 
longer but psychologically and socially we havent caught up with 
those advances

americans live longer than in any other period of the nations 
history they are also ironically it seems more obsessed about 
age and growing old than ever 
look in any card shop for evidence row upon row of birthday 
cards offer congratulations for every age group from newborns to 
90yearolds cards for people reaching the current landmark 40th 
birthday particularly abound as the baby boom generation enters 
middle age 
but it wasnt always so even in this century prior to major 
advances in medicine and education growing old was not something 
to be feted said dr gene cohen deputy director of the national 
institute on aging in bethesda md 
today there is a growing number of people who are aging 
well cohen said earlier when large numbers of people did not 
age well people expected a traumatic and dismal later life 
in fact the american tradition of celebrating birthdays is 
itself only about 100 years old according to howard p chudacoff 
a professor of history at brown university chudacoff has traced 
the evolution of age consciousness in this country in how old are 
you princeton university press 1990 
chudacoff who specializes in the history of urban society 
writes that the arrival of the first birthday cards around the turn 
of the century coincided with a growing emphasis on age it was at 
this time that children first were grouped into classes by age and 
that pediatrics was established as a separate medical specialty 
scientific advances improved nutrition and changes in 
demographic patterns as society became more urban also played a 
role in enhancing the importance of age chudacoff said 
death could have come anytime in life 200 to 300 years ago 
chudacoff said in an interview death was part of everyday life 
people accepted it now we have confined death more to later 
stages of life 
the annual marking of ones birthday became not only a personal 
milestone but a way for a person to relate to society 
for trivia buffs hudacoff also pinpointed the birth of happy 
birthday the most popular tune in the american repertoire to 
1934 happy birthday itself has thus only reached middle 
age a term which gained currency only after world war i 
chudacoff writes 
but the widespread celebration of birthdays and growing 
awareness of age had its downside 
ageism is a discriminatory shorthand for representing certain 
abilities in society chudacoff said adding that lumping people 
together according to age is too artificial as well as unfair 
like gender and race the 47yearold author writes age 
cannot be changed to disadvantage individuals merely because they 
possess a particular characteristic one for which they cannot be 
held morally responsible offends traditionally american 
sensibilities of fairness 
chudacoff reiterated in the interview that age 65 does not 
mean you lose all talents or productivity 
there are now more than 30 million people over 65 in the united 
states cohen said that is more than the population of canada 
the fastest growing segment of the population is the age group 
85 and over the average life expectancy in this country is about 
75 years for men slightly higher for women 
while americans remain preoccupied with their individual 
biological timeclocks societys view of growing old is changing 
experts agree chudacoff also thinks age consciousness may have 
peaked that society is possibly entering into an era of age 
irrelevance 
by the latter part of the 20th century amercians had become 
more sensitive to the consequences of using age as a criterion for 
social status and as a norm for behavorial expectations 
chudacoff says at the end of his study perhaps as with racism 
and sexism this recognition also represents the peak of age 
consciousness in the course of american cultural history 
cohen agrees and describes this trend as the blending of 
generations 
the blending of generations is escalating maintains cohen 
whose institute conducts research on aging you look at someone 
who is 65 and you dont think of them as old 
chudacoff however argues that american society will still rely 
on age as a tool to gauge achievement or buttress certain mores it 
will still be taboo or at least frowned upon for a 65yearold to 
marry a 25yearold he said

as allen furfine is finding out its never too 
late to change the world 
im going to do it one student at a time said furfine 63 
a member of a tutoring program in which senior citizens help teach 
youngsters to read 
from all accounts the program in its second year has been a 
success for pupils and tutors 
we have just begun to scratch the surface of what this 
population can do for this country said marylen mann national 
director of the st louisbased oasis or older adult service and 
information services which sponsors the program 
we are developing a model of productive aging she said 
this is the time to discover who you are and what you can do 
oasis a nonprofit organization for people older than 60 was 
founded nine years ago it provides educational cultural and 
wellness programs for 120000 members in 20 cities 
the tutoring program began in st louis and denver last year and 
is expanding to phoenix and rochester ny this year ms mann 
hopes to add two or three cities a year 
this is a tremendous program and we are delighted to see it 
flourish said david mahan interim superintendent of st louis 
public schools mahan said the tutors may prevent a lifetime of 
pain and frustration that comes along with illiteracy 
tutors are trained for 18 hours then work with children ages 6 
to 9 tutors must commit to at least one hour of instruction a week 
throughout the school year 
furfine one of 40 people in the st louis area to volunteer 
retired from his engineering job at mcdonnell douglas corp three 
years ago he also had worked as a substitute teacher 
in one way or another i consider myself a teacher furfine 
said ive always thought it was a ball 
celeste felton 69 worked with four children in st louis last 
year a retired registered nurse she said the experience has 
broadened her horizons 
its not an overnight thing she said you just cant run 
in there and start motivating and teaching you first have to find 
out what the child likes 
ms felton said she has used math drawing and many other 
doors to involve the child 
these kids are supposed to be our future leaders she said 
the more they learn the better off they will be whatever im 
able to give im happy to help out

american consumers are telling it like it is 
you cant even find a job if you want a job you cant find 
one this here messenger i dont like it complains miguel 
torres of new york 
we were thinking about buying a second car but well have to 
hold off frets patti johnson a canton ga housewife and 
mother 
we were planning to go to naples fla for awhile and were 
not going to do that says erica grasman a retired travel agent 
in deer park long island 
however they phrase it many consumers believe the economy is in 
a recession or about to enter one and these perceptions determine 
their buying habits habits which until now have been the driving 
force behind eight years of economic growth 
and theyre not buying according to government statistics and 
surveys of retail stores 
consumer spending accounts for twothirds of all economic 
activity if that declines it often is enough to throw the us 
economy into a tailspin 
the commerce department said last week that consumer spending 
declined in november for the second straight month when adjusted 
for inflation 
retail sales also fell in november and are sluggish this month 
despite the holidays even before christmas retailers are putting 
merchandise on sale 
economist allen sinai of the boston co says consumers are 
hunkering down because of declining incomes and job losses 
and i think that hunkering down will extend through almost all of 
1991 
the growth in personal income stalled in november except for an 
increase in farm subsidies the commerce department says and 
according to labor department statistics 900000 people have lost 
their jobs since last summer helping to push the jobless rate to 
59 percent many who remain employed are working fewer hours 
peoples purchasing power is being squeezed says economist 
sandra shaber of the futures group in washington 
adding to the consumers plunging confidence in the economy are 
worries about a possible war in the middle east and the initial 
surge in oil prices after iraq stormed kuwait and disrupted the 
world market 
inflation has since moderated but consumers continue to be 
cautious often avoiding expensive purchases and looking for sales 
susan naujokaitis of san diego says she has postponed her 
shopping because retailers seemed frightened that spending was 
falling as long as the stores are scared im waiting 
definitely for endoftheseason sales she says 
some however havent waited for markdowns at major retailers 
shopping instead at discount stores 
for instance darlene waldrop a pasadena calif accountant 
cut her christmas budget from 500 to 200 this year doing all 
her shopping at bargainclub warehouse stores 
although ms waldrop says her job at a health maintenance 
organization appears secure california aerospace companies have 
cut employment severely this year and this could eventually have an 
impact on her employer 
it makes you more careful she says 
some consumers have become more creative 
actress lyndsay dawkins says hollywood appears to be 
belttightening too so this year ive thought of gifts that i 
can make 
wyn smith of woodstock ga who just found another job after 
being laid off says shes cut back her christmas spending by about 
25 percent ive made a lot of stuff this year crafts she 
explains 
but its not just christmas shopping thats been devastated by 
consumer concern automobile sales remain dismal the housing 
industry is in its deepest decline since the 198182 recession 
i postponed the purchase of a new automobile for my wife at 
least until june 1991 and even then i will be very critical of the 
economic picture before making a purchase says buck buchanan who 
lives in the exclusive hollywood hills section of los angeles 
for donald hirsch a san bernardino independent auto wholesaler 
the tough times started three years ago when retail sales of new 
cars fell and used cars rose that prompted dealers to buy more 
secondhand cars leaving fewer for the independents 
the wholesale market has dried up and those guys are out there 
fighting for cars said hirschs wife karen i think they 
should stop calling it a recession and start calling it a 
depression 
rick williams and his wife waiting at a tulsa shopping mall 
while their daughter posed with santa claus said theyve delayed 
buying their house because of economic uncertainty 
even those consumers whose jobs are intact express concern over 
the economy 
im starting my eleventh year at the firm and this would be 
the first year i havent received a holiday bonus frets july 
huffman a los angeles legal secretary 
i have a steady income but i know others who dont have a lot 
put away says cody payne of tulsa okla theyll be having 
trouble making payments 
some of the more fortunate still express concern over the 
growing number of jobless and homeless people 
a new york television producer who asked to remain anonymous 
was telling a reporter that his planned christmas caviar 
splurge for his parents has been cut in half when he 
interrupted himself in midsentence 
this sounds so awful he resumed there are poor starving 
people everywhere its horrible out and i am worrying about these 
things 
bob halliday a stratford conn professor who says his income 
is not threatened nevertheless is cutting back on his spending too 
so that he could contribute more to the salvation army and other 
charitable causes 
its not a big deal he says but its something on a 
professors salary it is something there are some beautiful 
people on the street that deserve a better way

store shelves and long lines can it be that even the russian 
version of santa claus will be carrying an empty sack 
da humbug 
shoppers complain bitterly that they cannot find the toys their 
children so desperately want for new years day the giftgiving 
holiday most soviets celebrate instead of christmas 
on the morning of jan 1 soviet children will wake up early and 
receive their presents from ded moroz or grandfather frost a 
jolly old whitebearded elf similar to santa claus 
but the evening moscow newspaper wrote this month that the 
soviet economy was so bad not even ded moroz with his magic 
powers can solve the shortages and his sack may be empty 
in the selection of toys at detsky mir the cavernous 
fivestory childrens store adjacent to kgb headquarters in 
dzherzhinsky square theres not much that would hold a childs 
interest for long 
there were lots of inexpensive crude plastic items such as 
lambs elves and rabbits best suited for playing with in the 
bathtub simple trucks and cars toy guns tambourines and small 
toy soldiers for sale there seemed an oversupply of toy men with 
headbands and spears in a box marked simply indians 
but there were no batteryoperated toys or electronic games and 
no dolls for sale even though some were displayed in the stores 
huge picture windows 
marina a 30yearold muscovite who wouldnt give her last name 
was near tears as she explained her desperation in one of the 
stores dingy corridors 
there are absolutely no presents for children she said i 
have a daughter and two nieces and i wanted to buy new years 
presents for all three of them but i couldnt find anything 
my daughter is 7 she wants a barbie doll marina said her 
voice breaking with emotion i am ready to pay 100 rubles for a 
barbie but it is impossible to buy it even for 100 rubles i feel 
very bad about it 
one hundred rubles is more than a weeks salary for an average 
soviet worker 
olga kirianova who has sons aged 9 and 4 said her oldest child 
wanted a tabletop hockey game from grandfather frost but i cant 
find it for him 
i was here a couple of days ago and there were no toys at all 
in the whole shop she said 
the faltering economy was spoiling the holiday for everyone 
said ms kirianova 30 
in general the mood of the people is very low she said 
we dont feel that the new year holiday is coming we are 
concerned only with problems of what and where to buy 
her shopping companion tugged at her sleeve and said 
encouragingly come on lets try to find that hockey game 
a wearylooking nadia strastnichuk paused at a counter that sold 
holiday decorations and said she was frustrated in her search for a 
remotecontrol car or construction set for her 10yearold son 
my child thinks that grandfather frost will bring him a 
present ive been looking for a week already but without any 
success and here there are only some plastic toys which no 
one needs said strastnichuk 30 
i cant say any more she said i am so tired 
yelena ilyinichna a graying sales clerk in department no 136 
at detsky mir for 25 years said the best toy she had for sale was 
a small jeeplike car made in smolensk she touted to a 
customer rolling it on the glass countertop 
she said most shoppers were looking for electronic games model 
trains mechanical or batteryoperated playthings interesting 
and complicated toys and not these simple cars she said 
i feel very sorry for our customers and for myself as i cant 
unfortunately offer them anything worth buying she said

the rural cooperatives that provide power to 
25 million americans are massing a defense against bush 
administration attempts to cut off the billions in federal dollars 
that subsidize them 
administration strategists looking for ways to trim the 
mushrooming budget deficit are quietly trying to pull the plug on 
federal subsidies to electric cooperatives 
but powerful rural interests and their congressional supporters 
are marshalling forces to keep those subsidies in place without 
federal help they argue some of the nations 1000 or so electric 
coops could go under 
well go to the congress and well open political fire on 
president bush said bob bergland executive vice president of the 
national rural electric cooperative association the industrys 
lobbying group 
the focal point of the fight is the rural electrification 
administration the federal agency that funnels billions of dollars 
in lowinterest loans and loan guarantees to electric cooperatives 
across the country 
a handful of the coops are in default on 23 billion in loans 
from the rea three of them are in chapter 11 bankruptcy 
reorganization coloradoute electric association inc wabash 
valley power association inc and eastern maine electric 
cooperative inc 
the rea is working with another seven troubled coops to help 
restructure their debts 
while only a small fraction of the coops are in serious 
trouble nearly all of them have borrowed from the rea which they 
now owe some 36 billion rea administrator gary c byrne said 
recently the agencys lending program must be tightened to make it 
more responsible 
cheap federal loans and loan guarantees have been the backbone 
of the rural electrification program since it began 50 years ago 
under the new deal the program changed the face of american 
agriculture by providing cheap power that allowed farmers to 
modernize 
but critics including strategists in the white house office of 
management and budget say it has outlived its purpose and 
shouldnt be subsidized by taxpayers 
around 98 percent of us farms had electricity by 1964 
compared with only 95 percent in 1929 before the rea was 
established 
the program has long since achieved its goals and the 
continued federal assistance is both costly and unjustified 
economist ronald utt asserted in a study published in june by the 
conservative heritage foundation he said the electric coops 
should become entirely reliant on privatesector sources of 
credit 
the omb recently sent a memo to the energy department outlining 
a proposal to cut federal subsidies to the big public power 
marketers such as the tennessee valley authority and the 
bonneville power administration included in the memo was a 
recommendation to phase out all rea subsidies to electric 
cooperatives over 10 years 
that recommendation is likely to be the flashpoint early next 
year when bush submits his annual budget proposal to congress 
where rural democrats sympathetic to the coops control reas 
funding observers believe there is a strong chance the omb 
proposal will be included in the budget package omb spokesman tom 
bruce declined comment on the matter 
joelle ziemian a spokeswoman for the energy department would 
only say that the recommendations had been forwarded to bush 
ombs idea isnt new the nixon and reagan administrations 
espousing a freemarket approach tried to gut the rea and force 
the coops to borrow in the private market but the attempts were 
roundly defeated by the power of the coops lobby and their 
congressional supporters 
many observers expect the bush administrations initiative to 
meet the same fate 
its not going to happen the congress wont go for it said 
david freeman a former tva head who now is general manager of the 
municipal utility district in sacramento calif 
bergland who was agriculture secretary in the carter 
administration is plugged into the washington power grid and is 
considered a highly effective lobbyist he has led the national 
rural electric cooperative association since 1984 
the nreca is one of the most powerful lobbies in the world 
said fred smith president of the competitive enterprise institute 
a washington think tank 
through its political action committee the nreca contributed a 
total 577975 to the congressional campaigns of 242 democrats and 
126 republicans who ran in last months elections most of the 
money went to incumbent senators and representatives federal 
election commission records show 
we take a very hard uncompromising view on maintaining the 
rea bergland said in an interview at his washington office 
while admitting that reas original mission of electrifying 
farms has long been accomplished bergland and congressional 
supporters insist the subsidies are still needed to maintain the 
service they say some bankers are reluctant to make loans to 
electric coops 
most rural cooperatives buy electricity in bulk from other 
companies and distribute it to customers the biggest financial 
losses have been sustained by some of the larger coops that have 
built plants to generate their own power 
if the government stops making and guaranteeing loans to 
cooperatives the generating coops would be crippled bergland 
said there isnt a chance in the world they can survive he 
warned adding that 20 billion in rea loans to generating coops 
would be put at risk 
if that happened taxpayers likely would have to bail out the 
rea as they did when the federal farm credit system lost billions 
of dollars in the agricultural slump of the mid1980s 
the rea program has potent supporters on capitol hill most 
notably rep jamie l whitten dmiss chairman of the house 
appropriations subcommittee on rural development 
whitten declined to be interviewed until he had been briefed on 
current developments by the subcommittee staff his spokesman steve 
burtt said 
but rep glenn english dokla chairman of the house 
agriculture subcommittee on conservation credit and rural 
development said congress will ask very deep and probing 
questions of the administration on the rea budget issue 
english said the administration might be able to pull a fast 
one with rea funding on the house floor he contends that the 
opposition to coop aid is really ideological but has been 
disguised as concern about the budget deficit

the rows of honeycured hams waiting to be 
stacked aboard federal express jets gave a clear message to those 
in the know it was christmas time and time was running out 
when it gets late they go for things like hams packaged 
foods things you can order from a catalogue or a store thatll 
send them straight to us said dan copp a federal express 
spokesman and makeshift tour guide for the airlines sprawling 
cargo hub at memphis 
with the largest cargo airline in the world federal express 
stays busy year round but the basic organized madness of its 
memphis hub gets even brisker as the christmas deadline nears 
the holiday season starts making itself known in november when 
the package delivery company typically handles 15 million items 
worldwide this years oneday record was over 2 million on dec 
20 
the company guarantees overnight service anywhere in the united 
states but for the standard lastminute holiday shoppers friday 
was the deadline for prechristmas delivery 
federal express was founded in memphis on a hub system that 
brought all packages here from throughout the country before 
reshipment to their final destinations the system has been 
modified somewhat over the years but 65 percent of federal 
express packages still move through memphis the companys 
superhub 
it is aptly named 
with some 14 million square feet of covered space the total 
hub takes up 295 acres more than 5500 workers labor in the hub 
when its humming and 35 miles of conveyor belts carry thousands 
of packages through a stainless steel network of platforms stairs 
and observation towers 
hallways throughout the hub are dotted with closedcircuit tvs 
broadcasting a constant flow of information for workers from 
weather reports and package volumes to the latest employee stock 
options 
federal express has 94000 workers worldwide 
at the memphis hubs first level for separating the thousands of 
items from around the country hustling workers put packages on a 
conveyor belt and key their zip codes into a computer the computer 
times a packages movement along the belt and a mechanical arm 
swings out at the appropriate moment to move it from one belt to 
another depending on the code 
before long all items for california end up heading to one 
general area while those for say north carolina take another 
route the hub has 19 substations based on zip codes 
teams of workers at those various stations make finer 
destination distinctions once selected for a particular route an 
item is then packed with hundreds of others in enclosed shipping 
containers that link up to move through the hub like small trains 
led by tractors the trains then head outside to the jets

from the weakened bank of new england to the 
neighborhood savings bank experts say the regions financial 
institutions are limping into a recession they helped cause 
the economic slowdown sweeping new england is part cyclical but 
bankers and economists say it also reflects the extraordinary 
overoptimism displayed by lenders in the booming 1980s optimism 
rivaled only by that of the southwests savings and loan managers 
bankers are just scared stiff that they are in a texasstyle 
freefall that could envelop all the regions banks said paul 
getman an analyst with regional financial associates a banking 
consultant based in westchester pa 
this is a bankingled recession theres no question about 
that getman said that is why it is particularly bad in the 
new england area and why that area is the worst in the nation 
new englands economy is far more diverse and able to absorb a 
slump than was the oilbased economy of texas in the 1980s and 
strict zoning laws in new england acted as a brake on 
overdevelopment texas had no such restrictions and left itself 
wideopen for the inevitable bust following the boom 
every major bank holding company in texas essentially 
failed said ken guenther of the independent bankers association 
of america a washingtonbased banking association thats not 
going to happen in new england but there wont be a light at the 
end of the tunnel until real estate values stabilize 
statistics generated by the federal deposit insurance corp bear 
out the weakened condition of banking in new england 
massachuesetts connecticut new hampshire and maine were among 
the top six states in terms of commercial bank losses in the first 
three quarters of the year 
the fdic reported that there is little prospect of nearterm 
improvement in the northeast 
in a sign that banks expect times to get leaner the 180 
commercial banks in massachusetts rhode island and connecticut 
sharply increased their reserves for bad loans this year 
savings banks which were once limited to smallscale loans 
much like the savings and loan institutions dominate new england 
banking and they too are in trouble threequarters of the 
nations 471 savings banks are in new england 
a recent house banking subcommittee report referred to severe 
weakness among savings banks and to earnings that had 
nosedived 
even some bankers admit that lending practices by their 
colleagues contributed to the economic slide 
i believe that it was an overextension of credit in commercial 
real estate said jasper j jaser president of prime bank in 
orange conn banks were lending against equity which did not 
exist said jaser who is also chairman of connecticuts 
independent bankers association 
the situation in connecticut jaser said is still in a state 
of deterioration he predicted that several banks would close 
or be swallowed up by larger banks 
the nations banking community is closely watching the bank of 
new england which is based in boston and also owns connecticuts 
largest bank connecticut bank and trust 
not one banker wants to see bank of new england fail because 
it will cast a pall over all of them said getman of regional 
financial associates 
anticipating a possible spate of closures the fdic has opened a 
field office in franklin mass with 350 employees ready to handle 
the work that goes along with a bank failure 
not everyone blames the banks for causing the economic downturn 
lawmakers from the region have been harshly critical of what they 
call excessive federal regulation of new england banks others have 
blamed overly restrictive laws 
michael devito of the rhode island bankers association said 
federal tax reform in 1986 made real estate a less attractive 
investment and contributed to the downturn in new england where 
real estate is an important part of the economy in addition 
devito said the 1980s saw the growth of investment firms that 
could offer mutual funds and compete with banks for depositors 
dollars 
but state and federal officials may be in no mood to ease 
restrictions on banking as devito advocates if anything the 
pressure may be in the opposite direction according to jaser 
prime banks president the errors of banks over the past several 
years may lead to reforms that more strictly control lending 
i dont believe this is going to be looked at in the future as 
a cyclical situation jaser said i believe there are going to 
be some serious ramifications

the state bank warned foreign banks and financial 
institutions monday not to accept illegal payments in rubles from 
soviet banks and businesses 
the central bank said soviet enterprises recently have tried to 
make tens of billions of rubles worth of payments to foreign 
companies claiming they have the governments backing 
but soviet law forbids either individuals or businesses from 
exporting more than 30 rubles without special permission 
the ruble is not convertible and soviet businesses and joint 
ventures pay foreign bills either with hard currency through bank 
transfers or by barter arrangements 
there have been numerous reports recently by various sources 
about the emergence of payment documents in rubles payable 
checks bills letters of guarantee issued by soviet banks and 
enterprises for tens of billions of dollars the bank said in a 
statement carried by the tass news agency 
the statement did not identify the companies 
it is claimed that some of these commitments have been 
guaranteed by the ussr state bank neither the ussr state 
bank nor the soviet finance ministry has given such permission to 
soviet banks and enterprises it said 
the soviet union is concerned about an accumulation of rubles 
abroad which could be dumped back into the economy without notice 
or at some inconvenient time such as when the ruble is made 
convertible 
the state bank on monday also warned that some soviet companies 
are making deals to import goods and pay foreign companies more 
rubles than the governmentset exchange rate 
the foreign firms are using these rubles to buy large quantities 
of soviet goods preferably raw materials export them and make 
huge profits the bank said 
this practice undermines money circulation increases 
inflationary processes in the country and postpones the 
convertibility of the soviet currency the statement said

years died saturday at his home in east aurora outside buffalo 
mastercard was started in 1966 as a competitor to the card 
issued by bank of america after that bank which was licensing 
other banks to issue its card refused marine midland a license 
because marine was too big 
hinke then executive vice president of the buffalobased marine 
midland persuaded marine to start a credit card association in 
competition with bank of america 
the trial credit card operation was started in binghamton and 
spread to jamestown syracuse rochester and buffalo it then 
attracted other east coast banks including chase manhattan mellon 
bank and the bank of detroit which formed the interbank card 
association in 1966 
by the end of 1967 there were 150 members and interbank 
eventually overtook bank of america which consolidated its efforts 
and became a member of interbank its credit card originally was 
named master charge and later was renamed mastercard

are receiving more than 250000 a year each but the firm said the 
salaries were set early in the case are necessary to manage its 
business and are on a par with compensation elsewhere on wall 
street 
a drexel spokesman steven anreder said the firm was trying to 
control expenses for its own benefit and that of creditors who 
stand to gain more money in a reorganization if the firm can hold 
down costs 
the report comes as salaries and compensation fall at major wall 
street firms during an industrywide recession 
drexel documents show the firm is paying a total of 35 million 
to its sharply reduced staff of about 290 employees or an average 
of 121000 a year of that 211 million is for 73 officers and 
1405 million for the rest of the staff 
two traders robert beyer and mark attanasio who are managing 
directors in capital markets are receiving 145 million each 
according to the documents which first were reported in the new 
york times and confirmed by the firm 
the confidential documents which were given to several 
creditors committees detail drexels finances through october the 
firm said the compensation figures are annualized 
david boies an attorney representing government thrift agencies 
suing drexel for alleged fraud in the sale of junk bonds said the 
salaries and other expenses such as legal costs were depleting 
drexels estate 
boies said that while some salaries obviously were needed to run 
drexel during its chapter 11 proceedings we dont believe the 
amount is being kept to a reasonable necessary minimum 
every dollar that is paid out unnecessarily is potentially a 
dollar less for the taxpayers to recover he said boies 
represents the federal deposit insurance corp and resolution trust 
corp in claims against drexel 
drexels parent filed for bankruptcy reorganization in february 
and the brokerage subsidiary followed suit in may the firm has 
stated it plans to emerge as a reorganized entity that would among 
other things be involved in restructuring distressed companies 
boies said drexels listed assets about 2 billion fall far 
short of covering the firms liabilities including lawsuits 
seeking tens of billions of dollars in alleged damages drexel last 
year admitted to six criminal counts related to illegal trading 
the fdic and rtc lawyers have called for liquidating the firm 
saying there was no chance drexel could reorganize as a viable 
business two judges involved in the case have balked at supporting 
a liquidation 
the drexel spokesman said the firm independently had asked us 
bankruptcy judge francis conrad for permission to hire a firm to 
review its compensation structure and help set payouts for 1991 
the report is due in janaury 
these compensation levels have been under careful and 
continuous oversight by the board of directors by the creditors 
and by the equity committee anreder said drexel has been 
living in a fishbowl as far as its expenses and compensation is 
concerned 
this notion that were excessively paying people is 
inaccurate he said 
anreder said drexel needed to pay competitive salaries to 
executives and top traders to keep them at the firm to help devise 
a reorganization plan and manage its large but toughtosell 
portfolio of junk bonds 
he also said some executives are crucial to the firm retaining 
an institutional memory so it can respond to about 13000 civil 
claims filed in the bankruptcy 
for instance anreder said the presence of some longtime 
executives has been critical in helping drexel increase receipts 
from other bankruptcy cases in which the firm is a creditor 
the debate is not the first one involving compensation at 
drexel questions over some 260 million in payments made by the 
firm shortly before it filed for chapter 11 still are unresolved 
drexel during the 1980s was known as the highest paying firm on 
wall street where compensation routinely was in the millions of 
dollars best known is the firms 550 million 1987 compensation 
for nowconvicted financier michael milken

dawson complained that theepa didnt appoint six scientists the 
tobacco institute had proposed for the expert panel i think a 
strong argument can be made that the deck is stacked against us 
she said 
but richard daynard an attorney and chairman of the tobacco 
products liability project in boston said he didnt understand why 
the tobacco industry had been made a party to the deliberations 
nobodys talking in these proceedings about regulating the 
tobacco industry he said theyre talking about regulating 
individual behavior they basically have no business being in there 
at all and instead theyve been given a preferential window into 
the private deliberations of the epa 
epa officials denied the industry was given special access and 
they gamely proceeded with the meeting of the expert panel in 
arlington 
the result was a stronger affirmation of the epas conclusions 
than the agencys staff expected 
we are persuaded that the evidence exists for considering 
that ets does cause lung cancer in nonsmokers said the panels 
chairman morton lippmann of new york university 
the tobacco contigent was somber the outcome has certainly 
not been entirely to our satisfaction said dawson 
the panel must now prepare a written summary of its comments for 
the epa staff to serve as the underpinnings of a final version of 
the passivesmoking report 
agency scientists said it is now almost certain the final report 
will retain the conclusion that passive smoking causes lung cancer 
but the tobacco industry isnt finished 
im not willing to concede that this is over yet said 
dawson

bond prices fell in thin preholiday trading 
monday on pessimism over heightened middle east war talk 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond dropped 2532 point or 
781 per 1000 in face amount its yield which rises when the 
price falls rose to 835 percent from 829 percent late friday 
market analysts said increasing war talk over the weekend from 
us and iraqi officials sent down the price of the key bond at the 
start of trading 
before concluding a visit to the gulf region defense secretary 
dick cheney said the clock is ticking toward war with iraq 
cheney declined to say whether the united states has a timetable to 
attack iraqi forces if saddam hussein ignores a unimposed jan 
15 deadline to leave kuwait 
meanwhile saddam iraqs president said tel aviv will be 
iraqs first target if war breaks out it was the first time he had 
threatened to make the jewish state his first target 
war in the middle east likely would push up the price of oil an 
inflationary event that would erode the value of treasury 
securities 
it is nothing more than a continuation of the war jitters we 
saw that began to dominate trading last week said william v 
sullivan director of money market research at dean witter reynolds 
inc 
also traders were selling to square their positions before the 
end of the year and to avoid losses should the situation in the 
persian gulf change on christmas day when the nations financial 
markets are closed 
sullivan said trading was extremely light in an abbreviated 
trading session 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds shortterm 
maturities fell 332 point to 932 point intermediate maturities 
declined 1116 point to 916 point and longterm issues were off by 
up to 2732 point the telerate inc financial information service 
reported 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the lehman brothers daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer was down 454 to 117745 
yields on threemonth treasury bills were down to 672 percent

sixmonth bills rose to 693 percent as the discount increased rose 
2 basis points to 662 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 
698 percent as the discount gained 4 basis points to 655 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was trading at 7 percent down from 7 percent late friday 
in the taxexempt market the bond buyer index of 40 actively

the us dollar is rapidly becoming the currency 
of choice in the soviet union due to growing confusion over the 
value of the ruble during the countrys struggle to become a 
marketdriven economy 
rubles are worth nothing outside the soviet union because the 
government refuses to back them with hard currency gold or silver 
but inside the country tourists can walk up to a moscow hotel 
currency booth and buy six rubles for one dollar or 16 cents each 
if they use a credit card they get 18 rubles for that same 
dollar the socalled commercial rate 
on the black market a dollar fetches about 20 rubles 
confusion reigns everywhere said andy rafalat deputy 
general director of moscows two pizza hut restaurants 
more and more firms have been switching as many transactions as 
possible to hard currencies the favorite being the us dollar 
leaders of the huge russian republic who want to make the ruble 
the only legal currency in the country have coined a word for the 
trend dollarization 
barter deals from pepsicos vodkaforoil tankers deal to 
using the instantly recognizable redandwhite marlboro cigarette 
package to flag a cab are also becoming more popular 
until recently foreign businesses had dealt in the official or 
hard ruble known in russian as valuta their price tags and 
restaurant menus were printed in official rubles but payable only 
in hard currency or credit cards at the official rate 
this rate was effectively replaced in november with a new 
commercial exchange rate devaluing the ruble to 18 rubles to the 
dollar from 16 rubles 
in his decree president mikhail s gorbachev indicated this 
rate was to cover all international commercial transactions by 
soviet companies as well as joint ventures with foreign firms and 
foreign residents in the soviet union 
the official rate was retained only for international currency 
comparisons and to protect third world countries whose debts are in 
rubles 
finland the soviet unions closest western trading partner was 
so confused that its central bank stopped clearing ruble 
transactions for nearly one week 
in moscow the swisssoviet joint venture sadko kept its staff 
on overtime one night to change all its price tags ruble prices 
were tripled but since the new ruble was worth only onethird of 
the old one the hard currency price remained the same 
pizza hut immediately started writing its credit card bills in 
us dollars to avoid any risk of customers being charged the 
higher exchange rate by banks ignoring the new rules 
explanatory notes have been stapled to all hard currency menus 
and rafalat said the company is considering reprinting them in 
dollars instead of rubles next month to make them easier to 
understand 
we were quite happy to use the hard ruble rate but only if 
theres an acceptable clear definition for our business use which 
at this moment hasnt been the case he said in an interview 
the only 100 percent clear road i can see is by quoting prices 
in another currency as we receive most of our hard currency in 
dollars dollars seem to be the most obvious thing to quote 
stockmann a finnish firm with grocery and department stores in 
moscow kept its price tags in the old official rubles and posted a 
notice on its front door advising customers but on jan 1 it will 
close its two moscow outlets to switch all prices and credit card 
transactions to dollars 
in this confusing situation we find it better to change the 
prices directly to dollars store manager ilkka arvola said 
these continuous questions and explanations between us and our 
customers is completely unnecessary and customers do not like 
this uneasy feeling neither do i he said 
customers sort of think we might be cheating them somehow 
which were not 
switching to dollars should also prevent disruptions the next 
time the ruble rate is changed he said 
western diplomats and businessmen say the new rate is a 
tentative step toward making the ruble convertible as it inches 
the soviet currency closer to its real value 
the soviet government has given no firm indication when or how 
it plans to make the ruble convertible

rarely has something so green made marketers so 
blue 
in the past year manufacturers have crammed supermarket shelves 
with everything from degradable plastic bags to 
ozonefriendly hair sprays in hopes of cashing in on the 
growing concern about the environment 
but the socalled green revolution one of the most powerful 
marketing machines since oat bran hit the dietary scene is 
grinding its gears lawsuits legislative proposals and consumer 
boycotts have led many companies to stop claiming broad 
environmental benefits for their products 
the major manufacturers have backpedaled because they are 
leery of getting caught in making claims that through no fault of 
their own they cant substantiate said robert mcmath a consumer 
products expert and director of the new products showcase and 
learning center in ithaca ny 
mobil chemical corp said last spring it would refrain from 
promoting its hefty plastic bags as photodegradable after 
consumer and government groups complained the bags wouldnt degrade 
anytime soon inside the darkened recesses of landfills where most 
trash ends up 
seven states subsequently sued mobil this summer saying the 
company hasnt removed all of the existing products that still 
contain those criticized claims 
whats happened is that the hefty incident has really made 
manufacturers go back to square one said simon williams 
president of michael peters design a new york consultant firm that 
specializes in earthfriendly packaging 
retreats from biodegradable claims have since become widespread 
following mobils announcement last spring first brands corp of 
danbury conn and webster industries inc of peabody mass 
said they would also refrain from degradability claims for their 
glad and good sense plastic bags 
american enviro products inc of placentia calif agreed to 
stop promoting its bunnies disposable diapers as biodegradable 
after attorneys general in 10 states threatened to sue 
more recently willamette industries inc of portland ore 
one of the nations largest paper bag manufacturers eliminated the 
words biodegradable and recyclable from the bottom of its 
paper bags distributed at supermarket checkout counters in 17 
western states 
green cross certification co an independent certification firm 
hired by willamette said most consumers will not recycle the 
product and that the bags will take years to degrade in most 
landfills 
willamette still hypes the bags recycled content but green 
cross has verified it is composed of a minimum of 40 percent 
recycled consumer paper 
seventh generation a burlington vtbased mail order firm 
specializing in earthfriendly products announced a new policy 
regarding socalled degradable plastic bags in last springs 
catalog we suspended sale of these bags because we are no longer 
confident they are beneficial to the environment 
large manufacturers feel somewhat caught between the need to 
do something and the fear of figuring out the right thing to do 
while avoiding adverse implications for their current product 
line said jeffrey hollender chairman and chief executive 
officer of seventh generation 
to be fair the green flood has hardly subsided the number of 
new products hyping their ecological soundness nearly tripled this 
year to 751 according to marketing intelligence service ltd a 
research firm in naples ny 
but product consultants say they expect fewer new claims next 
year and they expect more of them to be of the provable kind 
critics say their next area of attack are supposedly 
earthfriendly aerosols whose ozonedestroying chlorofluorocarbons 
have been replaced by other suspect chemicals the biggest new 
growth area are household products ranging from paints to 
cleaners 
weve got to make sure consumers are not going to feel that 
every ad and every bit of labeling is to be disregarded because it 
is false and deceptive said new york state attorney general 
robert abrams in a telephone interview en route from his albany 
office 
indeed state officials praised a recent move by proctor amp 
gamble co to offer wasteefficient refillable containers for 
its downy fabric softener 
early this month at hearings in san diego a group of state 
attorneys general proposed nationwide minimum standards for 
environmental claims consistent with national and state legislation 
currently in draft form 
they also called for reduced use of general hardtodocument 
terms like environmentally friendly instead manufacturers are 
urged to be as detailed as possible when describing claims like 
recycled content telling precisely what percentage of the 
content is recycled 
states including new york connecticut iowa minnesota and 
texas are pressing for legislation that would bar manufacturers 
from using degradable on packages before more research is 
available on just how long it takes these products to decompose a 
new york bill failed to win approval this session 
for the first year there was no guidance said linda brown 
a spokeswoman at green cross which is based in oakland calif 
now companies are taking a closer look to see if any of these 
claims are falling into gray zones

the winter wheat crop after nearly a week of recordbreaking frigid 
weather in the great plains said victor lespinasse an assistant 
vice president in the grain trading division of dean witter 
reynolds inc 
a lot of winter wheat areas dont have adequate snow coverage 
which could increase winterkill if this weather continues and it 
looks like its going to for several days he said

changes in the soviet union could lead to civil unrest a military 
crackdown and a cutoff in us food aid he said

perceptions that beef consumption will increase with retail 
promotions after the holidays

northwest airlines has arranged for a 
portland ore utility to buy the pan am shuttle and allow 
northwest to operate the shuttle with an option to buy according 
to a published report monday 
northwest would not comment on the report in the wall street 
journal the newspaper said pacificorp would buy the bostonnew 
yorkwashington shuttle for about 150 million 
we cant comment on that as to whether we are in negotiations 
or struck a deal said doug miller a spokesman for northwest 
the nations fourth largest airline theres no announcement to 
make and we dont have any comment on it 
pacificorp and new yorkbased pan am also declined to comment 
pacificorp is the third largest utility in the west holding 
pacific power of portland and utah power of salt lake city a 
subsidiary pacificorp financial services inc has 17 billion in 
assets and has interests in 50 aircraft it reported a 1989 
aviation finance portfolio of 244 million spokeswoman caroline 
petrich said 
pacificorp finance inc a subsidiary of pacificorp financial 
services inc took preliminary steps nearly two years ago to 
acquire hal inc the parent of hawaiian airlines the deal never 
was completed 
marc robins an analyst who follows pacificorp for capital 
consultants inc of portland said he was unaware of the 
pacificorpnorthwestpan am deal but he said it sounded like a 
good opportunity for pacificorp financial services 
the portland companys interest likely would remain purely 
financial he said pacificorp executives probably are not 
interested in running an airline robins said 
the journal quoting unidentified sources familiar with the 
arrangement said union leaders were told this month that a sale 
was imminent but later were told it had been delayed 
leaders at three pan am unions could not be reached for comment 
no one answered phones in their offices 
guy cook head of the largest union at northwest said he knew 
nothing about the reported deal but he said such an acquisition 
could make sense for northwest 
ive heard a lot of rumors about an east coast shuttle said 
cook president of the international association of machinists 
district lodge 143 i knew there was an interest and from a 
shuttle standpoint for northwest there would be no problem 
cook said northwest might be able to run the shuttle without 
adding a lot of workers because it already has bases in new york 
boston and washington he speculated that pan am could use the cash 
from a shuttle sale to stay afloat and clear the way for a proposed 
buyout by trans world airlines inc 
henry pete dodge chairman of the northwest airlines chapter 
of the air line pilots association said he probably would have 
been informed by northwest chairman al checchi if such a deal for 
the shuttle were imminent 
dodge said he had no knowledge that a transaction was in the 
works but said he would welcome such a move 
it doesnt totally surprise me dodge said anything to 
help strengthen our domestic market certainly cant hurt 
checchi who led a 365 billion buyout of northwest last year 
repeatedly has said he wants to expand his airline through 
acquisitions he had expressed interest in the former eastern 
airlines bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle before it was sold 
last year to donald trump for 365 million 
northwest has hubs in detroit minneapolisst paul and memphis

brown amp williamson tobacco corp will not 
appeal a new jersey supreme court decision that health warnings on 
cigarette packs do not protect tobacco companies from liability 
suits the firm said monday 
in a statement louisville kybased brown amp williamson said it 
is confident it would win if any liability cases are presented and 
would not ask the us supreme court to review the new jersey 
decision 
the new jersey ruling flew in the face of a series of federal 
decisions that gave tobacco companies immunity from smokerdeath 
lawsuits after 1966 when congress ordered the labels placed on 
cigarette packs 
the ruling stemmed from a lawsuit filed by claire dewey of 
wyckoff in 1982 her husband wilfred dewey had died a year before 
on his 50th birthday from lung cancer after smoking for more than
