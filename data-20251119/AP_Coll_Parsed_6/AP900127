young marriages face tough odds but 
todd and bonnie longsine seemed off to a good start and headed away 
from some of the troubles of their adolescent years 
the two teenagers owned a threebedroom mobile home a car and 
a pickup truck and had a happy 14monthold son josh whose blond 
hair and blue eyes charmed their friends 
but longsine 19 turned against his family this week fatally 
shooting 18yearold bonnie setting a fire that killed josh and 
then ending his own life their bodies were found thursday by a 
repairman making a service call to their trailer 
no suicide note was found leaving their neighbors in the 
country estates mobile home park in greenville a town of 225 in 
northeastern wisconsin without explanations 
from what i could tell from todd and bonnie everything seemed 
to be fine neighbor kathy nichols said it seemed like he had 
it together he was happy to be a father 
the couple married in october 1988 a month or so before josh 
was born and bought their trailer home a year later todd 
graduated from menasha high school in 1988 worked at a warehouse 
for a brief time and then enrolled in a trade school to learn metal 
welding bonnie was a waitress in nearby appleton hoping to move 
up to management 
their actions seemed to be cutting a path away from their rocky 
adolescence when todd had some skirmishes with the law and bonnie 
dropped out of menasha high before her junior year 
but not everybody believed that all was well with the couple 
wendy reiland a friend of mrs longsines said the young 
mother wanted out within months of the marriage then changed her 
mind the couple filed a joint divorce petition a year ago then 
withdrew it last summer 
a neighbor krista vollmer saw a for sale sign in the 
window of their trailer one day earlier this month officials at 
fox valley technical college said todd failed to register jan 19 
for the spring semester 
outagamie county sheriff thomas drootsan said the 22caliber 
rifle that longsine used was bought just this week he shot bonnie 
set the fire outside joshs bedroom that asphyxiated the toddler as 
he slept and then shot himself authorities said the deaths went 
undetected until the repairmans call thursday because the fire 
burned itself out 
sheriffs capt gary barrington said friday that longsine had a 
juvenile record including an arrest for disorderly conduct but 
had not been in major trouble there were no reports of wife or 
child abuse during the marriage authorities said 
i wish we had a real good motive to lay on you but right now 
we dont barrington said 
longsines stepgrandmother irene stoeger said she remembered 
her grandsons being in trouble while growing up his mother 
reported him to the police department a lot ms stoeger said 
quite a few years ago todd went on a rampage he got mad 
police in menasha said they investigated longsine to see if he 
was helping bonnie hide when she ran away from home in spring 1988 
at age 17 he was not charged with anything and she eventually came 
back home 
mrs longsines mother barb godeck said friday that the family 
had reservations about longsine when the two married later that 
year the couple had met at a dance she said 
there were probably a lot of things we werent pleased 
about she said sometimes you think you know someone and you 
really dont 
bonnie was a very loving person her mother added anyone 
who knew her liked her she had no enemies 
mrs longsines boss at marcs big boy restaurant dave 
anderson called her a hard worker he said she seemed quieter 
somewhat tense the last two weeks 
we had ideas she was having marriage problems but to what 
extent everybody goes through marriage problems he said as 
far as we knew they were doing ok financially

when the editor of the sunday times sues the 
former editor of the sunday telegraph for libel fascinating issues 
are aired in court 
does it behoove hommes serieux to be seen in nightclubs 
should two editors pursue the same woman 
if a bimbette is a younger bimbo then what is an aging 
bimbette 
those issues arose this week as andrew neil editor of the 
sunday times waged his libel suit against peregrine worsthorne 
former editor of the sunday telegraph 
its jam for the tabloids of course but the usually sober 
quality papers also are enjoying a wallow in a case rife with the 
personal and professional passions of fleet street londons 
historic newspaper district 
neil alleges that worsthorne and the sunday telegraph falsely 
implied that he knew that pamella bordes his girlfriend for four 
months in 1988 was a prostitute 
miss bordes a former miss india was a lowpaid researcher in 
the house of commons a year ago when a tabloid broke the story of 
her other life 
that created a hot market for photos of miss bordes including 
one of her on the dance floor with neil and another of her holding 
hands with neils sunday competitor donald trelford editor of the 
observer 
in an editorial titled playboys as editors in the march 19 
sunday telegraph worsthorne thundered that anybody who finds the 
company of bimbos indispensable to their professional 
fulfillment might do well to conclude that editorial chairs were 
not designed for them 
neil a stocky 40yearold bachelor alleges that the 
editorial a cartoon and a subsequent article by another writer 
falsely implied that he knew that his girlfriend was a prostitute 
the principals in the case are all wellacquainted rupert 
murdoch owns the sunday times as well as the news of the world 
which broke the bordes story after worsthornes editorial neil 
acknowledged the sunday times had tried to hire him and it has 
hired the author of the other sunday telegraph article cited in the 
suit 
the defendants say worsthornes editorial was fair comment and 
not as opposing counsel suggested an overwritten piece of 
humbug 
newspapers are not in the business of being particularly 
tolerant or understanding about public figures when they get into a 
scandal testified worsthorne a patrician figure with flowing 
silver hair 
neil met miss bordes at a club called tramp which worsthorne 
regards as no fit milieu for the editor of the sunday times 
it is not a place where one is apt to meet the archbishop of 
canterbury the prime minister or even an archdeacon 
worsthorne said but a place where most men go for one reason 
to pick up girls at least he said on crossexamination thats 
why he used to go to nightclubs 
editors worsthorne said once were hommes serieux serious 
men who frequented learned seminars european chancelleries 
establishment dinners 
neil said he had become aware that trelford also was interested 
in miss bordes but neil warned trelford away because i thought 
no newspaper could resist a story of two editors and the same 
woman 
after a headline in the sun murdochs bigselling daily called 
trelford dirty don trelford publicly wondered why there was no 
mention of randy andy neil 
the sun made amends with thursdays screamer headline 
dirty don tried to pull my pam says randy andy 
earlier in the week mr justice michael davis was puzzled by 
the terminology in the gossip columns mr neil the judge 
interjected we heard yesterday the word bimbo i presume a 
bimbette is a young bimbo but can you help us what is an aging 
bimbette 
neil said he did not know 
worsthorne was at least prepared to define a bimbo an 
obviously very attractive young girl who tends to bat her eyelids 
and has a very attractive frontal whatever the correct word is

the defeat of us legislation that would have 
helped chinese students extend their stays in the united states is 
not likely to reverse chinas course of tightening exit controls 
the door already has closed significantly on what had been the 
freest period for exit from china in its 40 years of communist 
rule during which almost anyone who could get a scholarship abroad 
and a foreign visa was able to go 
regulations being circulated internally bar anyone under 30 or 
with less than five years of work experience from obtaining 
official sponsorship to study abroad sources in the education 
bureaucracy said this week 
other measures have made it harder for students to take tests 
for study abroad and obtain passports without official sponsorship 
fear of its students not returning home is only one reason for 
chinas shift in policy 
more basic is the governments fear that too many students are 
returning with antisocialist ideas that could undermine their 
hardwon communist revolution 
in september premier li peng set out the new policy 
henceforth those being sent to study abroad should mainly be 
visiting scholars and researchers because these people are older 
and more mature politically 
more than educational exchanges were at stake in the showdown 
between the us congress and president bush however 
a biting frontpage editorial friday in the party newspaper the 
peoples daily said if the legislation passed the united states 
shall be held responsible for the grave consequences 
it called the bill a naked expression of power politics and 
said its supporters were antichina addicts who hoped to coerce 
china into giving up socialism 
the bill would have waived a requirement the estimated 32000 
chinese in the united states as official exchange students return 
home for two years before seeking new us visas to work or 
continue study its goal was to protect students who feared 
retribution for protesting chinas crackdown on prodemocracy 
demonstrators in june 
both houses of congress passed the bill in november but bush 
vetoed it the house of representatives voted thursday to override 
the veto but the senates 6237 vote friday in favor of the bill 
fell four short of the necessary twothirds margin for an override 
china did not comment on the bills defeat although it was 
reported on national television and radio 
bushs veto of the bill was one of a series of conciliatory us 
steps that halted the serious deterioration in uschinese 
relations after june after the december visit of bushs national 
security adviser brent scowcroft china softened its comments on 
dissidents fang lizhi and his wife li shuxian who have been 
hiding in the us embassy in beijing since june 
however bushs success in quashing the controversial bill does 
not guarantee a speedy solution to the fangs dilemma china has 
little reason to push for a resolution which would require 
compromise on its part indications are that china continues to 
insist the fangs promise not to make political statements if they 
are allowed to go to a third country a promise that those who 
know fang believe he will not make 
moreover the strong support for the bill in congress and among 
the american public reveal ideological tensions that will prevent 
bilateral relations from returning to their rosy prejune state 
americans have been awakened to the harsher side of chinas 
communist rule and chinese leaders have stressed the need for 
vigilance against what they consider subversive american notions of 
democracy 
china wont stop sending students abroad they are vital to its 
plans for absorbing advanced technology but it will take 
strenuous measures to ensure that those who go abroad are loyal 
socialists and return that way

romance and femininity were in the air and on the 
runways as top designers unveiled their summer haute couture 
offerings 
short skirts curvy silhouettes swooping decolletes and 
charming colors were the most striking messages in the week of 
shows if the top designers have guessed right women want to be 
more feminine than ever as the new decade begins 
there were also plenty of wellcut pants for daytime or evening 
as an alternative to women who would rather hide than bare their 
legs 
it was a roller coaster week the grandmasters like yves saint 
laurent hubert de givenchy karl lagerfeld at chanel and new 
master christian lacroix triumphed 
paco rabanne a 56yearold spanishborn designer won the 
golden thimble award having worked in paris for nearly 40 years 
rabanne finally overcame his metallic sculptor image to receive 
the coveted prize awarded twice yearly by fashion writers 
but things didnt go so well in houses with new couture creators 
drawn from the ranks of readytowear the inventive claude 
montana who took over as lanvins haute couture designer drew 
sullen reviews 
although purely montana his clothes featuring mainly skinny 
pants with various toppers looked too selfconsciously 
futuristic for the moneyed set thats used to feminine clothes 
from lanvin 
another flop was angelo tarlazzis second collection for guy 
laroche although he had some zingy raffiabordered southofthe 
border stuff plus cute stitched peasant dresses and gringo pants 
the show didnt quite make the couture grade 
but there was much to remember elsewhere and the beauty of 
couture is that each client and those who are inspired by couture 
looks can opt for skirt lengths longer than the sensational 
runway models 
whos going to wear this wonder bemused tv spectators treated 
to snippets of the spectacular shows the answer is hardly anybody 
the outfits costing around 10000 and bought by only a handful 
of women are mainly moneylosers for the bigname houses but the 
designers renown serves to give the houses big publicity and 
promote sales of the real moneymakers perfume and cosmetics 
readytowear and accessories 
gossamerlight luxury fabrics made these clothes look lighter 
than ever though yves saint laurent won kudos for his sleek white 
suits in heavy pique ridged tussore and shantung silk 
memorable styles included the lolita charmers at chanel though 
most real women couldnt wear the teeny hintofchiffon skirts in 
delightful shades of coral and pink peeping under the sharply 
fitted long jackets 
christian lacroix had a field day with the light fabrics 
mounding clouds of organza lace or faille on wrapped or puffed 
skirts under skimpy or decollete tops for his incomparable 
highwaisted trapeze look of luxury 
the shoulder issue is irrelevant because saint laurent and 
givenchys boldshouldered daytime silhouettes still look elegant 
while at lacroix chanel dior and elsewhere they are mainly hidden 
under big organza collars or discreetly small and rounded by 
minimal padding 
as in readytowear thats already appearing in the shops the 
bosom is a big couture winner many suits or draped dresses have 
slashed decollete effects 
and transparent blouses are around although far from 
exclusively for those who want seethrough chic 
evening wear inevitably bares shoulders pushing up bosoms under 
strapless bustiers or daring decolletes a la belle epoque or the 
18th century look of marieantoinette 
other outstanding couture offerings included jeanlouis 
scherrers repeat trip to the fabulous india of the raj his 
jeweled laceembroidered light silk draped dresses or trouser 
outfits in white or tender pastels were an exercise in opulent 
beauty 
ungaro made a hit by trimming down his line to the couture 
basics his line of colorful short coatdresses and suits combining 
arabesques of several bright colors were a delight to the eye 
typical of the haute couture were sophisticated draped and 
splitskirt models in sumptuous light fabrics at balmain by 
designer erik mortensen 
fabric trends for the new soft looks include gabardine 
cashmere raw silk and textured linen as well as shantung silk 
crepe and cotton pique for daytime to the cocktail hour 
for evening romance came out in silk faille satin and clouds 
of organza and chiffon theres also lots of delicate or heavier 
guipure lace plus reembroidery and appliqued motifs pearls 
sequins and feathers 
the color palette includes lots of white and ivory regulation 
spring navy and brighter peacock blues khaki tobacco desert 
beige and chartreuse flash into sunbursts of yellows and mandarin 
orange with gleaming lashings of gold brocade and lame for evening 
pastels range from flesh tones to the most delicate eggshell 
pinks and blues and absinthe green violet salmon flame and 
fuchsia reds were outstanding in a brighter vein 
to go with this couture splendor there were all kinds of 
eyecatching headgear from satin turbans to enormous circular 
haloes at cardin funny visored pillboxes and piecrustcrimped 
crowns at givenchy 
chanel showed new boaters with bows under the brims and 
valentino topped many of his sophisticated models with hats that 
had trellisstyle woven brims matching latticework on some of the 
dresses

manuel noriega may have tried to put a curse on 
us attorney general dick thornburgh and the judge in his case 
federal prosecutors suggested friday at the deposed panamanian 
leaders bond hearing 
when invading us troops raided a noriega office now referred 
to as the witch house a room in his headquarters at fort 
amador just outside panama city they found black magic 
paraphernalia including an altar 
one soldier described signs of animal entrails and vats of 
blood as well as a portrait of adolf hitler 
on friday deputy assistant us attorney myles malman asked 
us district judge william hoeveler to deny bond to noriega 
because he was a danger to the community citing among other 
reasons a white sheet of paper with four names on it that the 
troops found with the other items in the witch house 
the list consisted of thornburgh charles sapho the head 
justice departments drug section mark schnapp a former miami 
federal prosecutor partly responsible for the noriega indictment 
and hoeveler himself 
malman did not mention a curse but such lists are sometimes put 
on altars by practitioners of voodoolike afrocaribbean religions 
to place a hex on those named 
maybe i better not enter it into evidence the judge joked 
as malman handed him the list 
hoeveler later denied bond to noriega

the suspended superintendent of the camp 
hill prison was fired friday for his actions during a threeday 
riot last year that left 123 people injured and more than half the 
institution in ruins 
the dismissals of superintendent robert freeman and one of his 
deputies were based on a recommendation by gov robert p casey 
who said friday that freeman was among the officials with primary 
responsibility for maintaining order 
casey concluded that those having responsibility for security 
should be held accountable for their actions 
three days of rioting at camp hill in october left 123 inmates 
officers and firefighters injured and caused an estimated 14 
million in damage administrators declared the prison secure after 
a first night of rioting oct 25 but inmates were able to free 
themselves and continued their rampage through oct 27 
on nov 1 just days after the rioting ended the associated 
press reported that guards had complained that prison officials 
ignored warnings of celllocking mechanisms being broken after the 
first night of rioting on oct 25 
freeman was suspended without pay the same day attempts to 
reach him for comment on his firing were unsuccessful because his 
telephone number is unlisted 
also fired was camp hills deputy for operations robert smith 
said corrections department spokesman kenneth robinson the 
spokesman said the dismissals were ordered by state prison 
commissioner david s owens jr on the governors recommendation 
terry henry camp hills deputy for treatment will be 
reassigned within the department robinson said the governor said 
he would have recommended the dismissal of maj john stover 
captain of the guard but stover had resigned 
in a news release casey cited the findings of an independent 
threemember investigative commission that concluded management at 
camp hill had failed to adequately search the prison after the 
first night of rioting management also failed to assure that cells 
were locked despite warnings that they werent secure the 
commission found 
the commission which presented its report in december also 
said that supervisory personnel had failed to keep an adequate 
force of state troopers at the prison to prevent a second night of 
rioting and that ample time was available for management to 
reconsider its decisions 
the panel criticized owens the prison commissioner for his 
handsoff dealing with the riots but the governor said he had 
confidence in owens 
the commission recognized that direct and primary 
responsibility for the security at camp hill did not rest with 
him casey said i have concluded that commissioner owens 
carried out his responsibilities in a competent and professional 
manner 
robinson said acting superintendent jeffrey beard would remain 
in place at the prison

bigcity mayors disappointed with president 
bushs antidrug efforts are asking the administration and 
congress to cut defense spending and raise taxes to finance 
solutions for innercity problems 
the us conference of mayors ended its threeday winter meeting 
friday after the president urged them to support his new drug 
strategy and proposal to increase federal antinarcotics drug 
spending by 11 billion 
but the mayors had more money in mind and the groups 
policymaking executive committee adopted a resolution urging the 
immediate use of a peace dividend in conjuction with increased 
revenues for an injection of new aid for americas cities 
the bush administrations approach is to force the poor people 
to decide between heating and eating said newark nj mayor 
sharpe james a democrat i think they need both 
the resolution was proposed by madison wis mayor paul soglin 
it repeats the mayors longstanding call for more federal taxes to 
finance urban needs it adds the socalled peace dividend saying 
the lessening of world tensions and crumbling of communism in 
eastern europe should leave military money available for such 
pressing domestic needs as poverty homelessness aids and drugs 
new york mayor david dinkins in backing the proposal said 
the peace dividend is not the entire answer but it is a good 
start a mere 5 percent savings in defense spending will yield 15 
billion that could be used for muchneeded urban programs 
bush appealed to the overwhelmingly democratic conference of 
mayors one day after unveiling his revised plan for fighting drugs 
he offered the mayors no specifics and no other initiatives on 
urban problems 
he repeated his call for more private efforts pledging to use 
his bully pulpit to ask for volunteers 
lets join hands to inspire the millions of americans who want 
to help america get clean and stay clean he said together 
lets defeat public enemy no 1 
but some mayors questioned whether the administration was really 
making drugs its top priority and faulted bush for failing to 
provide enough money to make drug rehabilitation treatment 
available to any drug user who wants it 
we have not yet seen a level of commitment in line with the 
size of the problem said mayor kathyrn whitmire of houston 
president of the conference and the elected leader of bushs 
adopted hometown we have not yet seen it move to the top of the 
agenda in the federal government 
mayors interviewed after the speech said they appreciated the 
symbolic support his appearance provided but that bush had offered 
the cities little that was new 
i guess you have to give the president a b for showing up 
said boston mayor raymond l flynn a democrat 
i think there is strong disagreement as to how to proceed to 
address some of the issues of urban america that have been ignored 
for such a long period of time he said 
i like what he said about education said mayor karen vialle 
of tacoma wash but we need the bucks to do it

a group of disgruntled residents of 
this desert resort city has abandoned a recall effort against mayor 
sonny bono 
ron winkler a member of save palm springs said the recall 
basically just died out one group member said more than 2000 
signatures had been gathered about half the number needed to 
trigger a special election 
the group accused bono 54 of using the office to revive a 
flagging show business career among other things 
we thought sonny bono was a joke when we started and he is 
still a joke said dick sroda another member of save palm 
springs at the present time he is laying a little low which is 
good 
i think the campaigning for signatures had some effect on him 
he seems to be a little more conscious of the people

efforts to revitalize the citys image could not be reached by 
telephone at city hall after business hours on friday

us sen dave durenberger repaid 11005 to 
the senate on friday returning money he received from the 
government to make payments on a minneapolis condominium the 
minnesota republican said in a statement 
durenberger said he was notified by the senate rules committee 
on thursday that he was not entitled to the money because it was 
paid from october 1983 to november 1989 at times when the senate 
was not in session 
it was the latest bad news for durenberger the senate ethics 
committee also is investigating him for arrangements involving his 
minneapolis condominium in addition to a book deal and 
lobbyistpaid trips to boston hes scheduled to go before the 
ethics committee next month 
he has apologized to minnesotans for what he said were mistakes 
and lapses in judgement but has denied any wrongdoing 
two recent statewide polls show that durenbergers popularity 
has plummeted since the investigation began last year and as many 
as 76 percent of minnesota adults want durenberger to resign if the 
ethics committee finds significant ethics violations 
the senator said he asked the rules committee in december to 
review his receiving per diem reimbursements for daily rental 
payments for the minneapolis condominium which he uses when on 
official business in minnesota 
the committee ruled he was not entitled to reimbursements for 
daily expenses while using the condo during august recesses and 
recesses between congressional sessions in the years 198389 
durenberger said 
this is a firstever ruling the senator said in nearly 
seven years of submitting these expenses for reimbursement i 
have never been notified by either the senate disbursing office or 
the senate rules committee audit staff that the expenses where not 
reimbursable 
the associated press was unable friday night to contact rules 
committee staff members friday night to confirm whether it was a 
firsttime ruling 
durenberger said he calculated that the total amount of 
reimbursements received for per diem expenses during those recesses 
was 11005 and he submitted a check for that amount to the 
financial clerk of the us senate 
when there is an official determination of the amount of 
interest that is due i will also pay that he said in the 
statement 
because his condo in mclean va is considered his usual place 
of residence during congressional sessions durenberger can claim 
expense reimbursement for time spent at the minneapolis condominium 
during sessions said carrie collins his press secretary

many of the 250000 listeners who tune in 
to michael feldmans nationwide whadya know program saturday 
mornings on american public radio beg to hear about his personal 
life 
but hes not talking about that anymore 
do you bother your minister or rabbi with that question 
feldman shot back at a caller on a recent show who asked how 
feldman spends his time when hes not on the air 
when i first started i talked about my divorce said 
feldman who said such talk was therapeutic now i figure its 
none of their business 
you have to save some for yourself 
the 40yearold bespectacled feldman known for his dry 
offbeat humor started whadya know in 1985 after working as 
a high school english teacher and experimenting with other radio 
jobs the program has developed a loyal following it airs on 103 
stations 
hes one of the most popular radio personalities on american 
public radio said dan jensen aprs marketing director in st 
paul minn 
whadya know airs before a live audience and features 
music a callin quiz and the town of the week a feature in 
which a town chosen by throwing a dart at a map is critiqued 
serious subjects are off limits on feldmans show instead the 
host prefers to ponder callers questions like if prunes are 
dried plums where does prune juice come from and do radio 
show hosts get dressing rooms 
not this one feldman replied to the latter query during a 
recent show i come dressed 
feldman said he hosts the show because its fun and he only has 
to go to his madison office twice a week 
im very lazy conceded feldman who spends much of his free 
time researching questions for the shows quiz or just doing 
nothing 
i hate working for a living he said my main concern was 
doing something fun 
feldmans growing popularity has earned him a chance to take his 
wit quizzes and other innovations on national television the 
disney channel will air four taped segments of whadya know in 
march 
he said he presently makes as much money as a bad lawyer 
but if the television debut proves succesful his salary could jump 
to that of an average lawyer 
he began working odd jobs in radio in 1977 but his first big 
shot came in 1984 when he was hired for a show at wgn in chicago 
but he and his cohost clashed and both were fired 
when the offer to host whadya know came in 1985 feldman 
was reluctant to leave chicago i wanted to stay and get my 
revenge he quipped 
but he went and his show now is heard around the nation 
including back in chicago where feldman recently did a live remote 
show that drew a sellout crowd of 1300 
im surprised sometimes at the dedication people tell me 
about he said im a little embarrassed by it all but im 
glad for it 
his show is usually aired from madison and people sometimes 
arrive two hours early to get a seat 
we have enjoyed michael feldmans zigzag humor for more than 
10 years said sandra larson who has been attending feldmans 
show with her husband since the days he broadcast from the madison 
diner 
hes refreshing she said he has that sort of boyish 
charm that lets people open up 
feldman doesnt spend a lot of time pondering his future 
i have an internal unattainable level of success he said 
in some ways i think its morally wrong to want to be successful 
but on the other hand i dont want to fail because ive done that 
and its not fun

president bush is proposing 3033 billion for 
defense in a new budget that would increase spending for the 
strategic defense initiative and calls for five b2 stealth 
bombers say congressional sources and pentagon documents 
the budget plan to be released formally on monday also would 
cut military personnel by 38000 fund two landbased nuclear 
missiles and cancel a number of weapons programs including another 
attempt to scrap the marine corps v22 osprey aircraft 
the plan would add 7 billion to the military budget bringing 
it to 3033 billion for the 1991 fiscal year a 24 percent 
increase from this years 2963 billion but about 2 percent less 
than what the pentagon would need to keep pace with inflation 
the figure includes 2921 billion for pentagon spending up 
from 2868 billion with the rest representing energy department 
spending for nuclear programs according to documents made 
available to the associated press friday by congressional sources 
total budget authority for the military in the year beginning 
oct 1 would be 3069 billion up from 3016 billion also 
including energy department money 
the budget figures come amid dramatic changes in eastern europe 
where nations are pushing towards democracy and administration 
officials concede the soviet threat has lessened 
this budget represents the first steps in responding to 
changes in eastern europe and the soviet union as well as tighter 
budget constraints defense secretary dick cheney said in 
comments included in the documents 
the budget total for sdi commonly known as star wars is 45 
billion in pentagon spending adding approximately 300 million in 
energy department money the program would get 48 billion 
the total is a 1 billion increase over what congress approved 
last year and reflects strong support for a vigorous sdi program 
that includes the brilliant pebbles technology for spacebased 
interceptors the pentagon said 
brilliant pebbles is a system composed of many small ground and 
spacebased interceptors that would sense enemy ballistic missiles 
the interceptors would ram the missiles causing them to explode 
a number of democrats in congress question the system and favor 
longterm research on directed energy weapons 
the budget proposal also includes 55 billion for five b2 
bombers the radarevading batwinged aircraft that has come under 
attack on capitol hill for its high price of about 530 million 
apiece last year congress gave the bush administration two of the 
three bombers it sought and this years total of five is certain to 
be attacked 
another thorny issue is the administrations plan to fund two 
landbased nuclear missiles the singledwarhead midgetman and the 
multiplewarhead mx missile the budget proposal calls for 202 
million for the midgetman and 28 billion for the mx 
among the other highpriced strategic programs in the budget is 
15 billion for one trident submarine and 17 billion for 52 
trident ii nuclear missiles 
the budget also includes plans to mothball two battleships the 
uss new jersey and the uss iowa and cancellations of various 
weapons programs some of which were on the chopping block last 
year 
among the programs terminated are the marine corps v22 osprey 
tiltrotor aircraft the navys f14d jet fighter the phoenix and 
maverick missiles the apache helicopter the army helicopter 
improvement program ahip the f15e fighter and the m1 tank 
congress last year rejected the administrations attempt to 
eliminate the osprey 
the budget calls for a reduction in active troop strength by 
38000 from nearly 21 million and cuts in civilian forces of 5000 
and reserves by 3000 
at the pentagon a senior administration official said the 
spending would represent a decline in purchasing power after 
inflation is taken into account 
it means that we will be able to buy fewer planes tanks and 
ships and support fewer troops said the official who spoke 
only on condition he not be named

the energy department is dropping plans to 
build a plutonium refinery in idaho that the reagan administration 
had called essential to modernizing the nuclear weapons complex 
according to department sources 
the decision reflects the bush administrations reconsideration 
of nuclear arms priorities in light of democratic reforms in 
eastern europe and domestic budget pressures 
the decision to end financing for the special isotope separation 
plant planned for construction at the idaho national engineering 
laboratory near idaho falls will be part of the fiscal 1991 budget 
president bush sends to congress monday according to sources who 
spoke friday on condition of anonymity 
the plant was expected to cost at least 12 billion but 400 
million already has been spent on design and related work and 
construction has not started 
just 13 months ago in an official blueprint for modernizing the 
nuclear arms production complex the reagan administration called 
the idaho project timecritical and essential it was to have 
been the first new atomic weapon plant since the n reactor which 
produced plutonium at the hanford nuclear reservation near 
richland wash was put into operation 27 years ago 
the projects refining technology which uses lasers to vaporize 
plutonium so that it can be used in nuclear warheads has been 
criticized as unduly hazardous by environmental groups 
energy secretary james d watkins strongly backed the idaho 
project in congressional testimony early last year but has been 
reconsidering for several months 
phil hamric manager of the energy departments idaho field 
office declined to confirm the decision 
the department announced friday however that it had 
indefinitely postponed a series of public hearings that would form 
part of the foundation for a study of the environmental impact of a 
prototype for the idaho plutonium refinery 
the postponement which was not explained by the department 
apparently resulted from watkins decision to drop the idaho 
project watkins had announced last year that the department would 
prepare an environmental impact report on plutonium refining 
experiments with the prototype which is at livermore calif 
the hearings were to have been held feb 2 and 3 at livermore 
and feb 7 at idaho falls 
on wednesday sens james mcclure and steve symms republicans 
of idaho issued a joint statement saying they expected the 1991 
budget to contain no money for the project both were strong 
supporters of the project 
if what we have learned is correct it appears that there will 
be zero funding in the budget for construction of the plant the 
senators said adding that they accepted the decision based upon 
a variety of global developments and budgetary issues 
the snake river alliance a boisebased environmental group 
said they interpreted the idaho senators statement as meaning the 
project was dead 
we believe that construction funds for this porkbarrel relic 
of the cold war will never be seen in the federal budget again 
said elizabeth paul the groups executive director 
in a related development friday the energy department announced 
it was replacing the manager of the troubled rocky flats plutonium 
processing plant near denver which has been closed since november 
to review management and safety procedures 
watkins said robert m nelson jr deputy manager of the 
departments nevada field office in las vegas would take over at 
rocky flats for david p simonson who will move to the deputy 
managers slot there

manuel noriega must remain in jail despite his 
claim that he is a prisoner of war and should be moved to a neutral 
country a judge ruled 
us district judge william hoevelers decision on friday came 
after prosecutors portrayed the fallen panamanian ruler as a 
wealthy and dangerous man with cash and armed supporters 
potentially hidden around the world 
mr noriega is a danger to the community said deputy 
assistant us attorney myles malman said during the bond hearing 
he is a military man trained and skilled in the use of 
counterterrorism covert actions and weapons 
prosecutors said the 145year sentence noriega could be given if 
convicted of drug trafficking coupled with his extraordinary 
wealth made it likely he would flee the country if released on 
bond 
investigators and us troops who invaded panama found up to 30 
million in noriega assets including homes in panama a condominium 
in france sports cars and bank accounts malman said 
on noriegas ranch soldiers found envelopes marked 
confidential for my general and stuffed with 58 million in 
cash he said 
but defense attorney frank rubino insisted the court has no 
jurisdiction in noriegas case and refused to participate in the 
bond hearing 
to the best of my knowledge this is the first time the united 
states has invaded a country toppled its government and put its 
leader on trial rubino said outside the courthouse 
rubino told the judge that a letter from noriega to president 
bush was delivered friday to the white house and the state 
department claiming status as a prisoner of war under the geneva 
convention 
the defense contended that an international tribunal perhaps 
the world court at the hague or geneva must automatically be 
invoked by noriegas alleged pow status 
hoeveler did not consider the motion immediately 
prosecutors emphasized noriegas alleged dark side in their 
effort to keep him in jail saying he was known for torturing 
opponents and personally ordered the execution of the leader of the 
failed october coup attempt against him 
they also said soldiers found the names of the four people on a 
sheet of paper in noriegas fort amador office which contained so 
much black magic paraphernalia us soldiers called it the witch 
house 
malman implied that the list was part of a curse against the 
four men the judge himself us attorney general dick 
thornburgh charles saphos head of the justice departments drug 
section and mark schnapp a former miami federal prosecutor who 
helped bring about the noriega indictment 
maybe i better not enter it into evidence the judge joked 
malman said noriega 51 has a 400000 condominum in paris and 
a 500000 threestory home in panama the prosecution introduced 
photos of deposit slips showing that noriegas 17yearold daughter 
deposited 13 million in panamanian banks in september 1989 
the us government also has frozen 20 million in noriega 
assets scattered in bank accounts the prosecution maintained that 
noriega also transferred about 19 million from an account in 
london to one in luxembourg after the indictment was unsealed it 
was unclear whether the deposits and seizures were duplicated in 
the prosecutions listings 
in addition to those sums noriega was said to have friends in 
countries at odds with the united states including cuba and libya 
he noted that moammar gadhafi had presented noriega with his and 
hers gadhafi watches 
asked by hoeveler at the end of the session if he wished to 
rebut prosecution arguments rubino replied by reciting noriegas 
name rank and serial number 0001

jackaroos and jillaroos who are fair dinkum 
are sidling up to elkos billabongs trying their hands at being 
spruikers instead of ringers and drovers 
thats the australian version of events at the sixth annual 
cowboy poetry gathering that winds up today in this town between 
reno and salt lake city 
what the aussies mean is that male and female ranch hands who 
are the real thing are going to elko watering holes to become 
reciters of poetry instead of cowboys 
six balladeers from down under joined some 70 american cowboy 
poets from 16 western states in this years celebration of poetry 
readings 
cowboy poetry was spawned around nighttime campfires on the open 
range 
i think people will be surprised to find australians 
basically have a parallel tradition to our cowboy poetry 
tradition said hal cannon cofounder of the elko event they 
have a similar stockman tradition and their history of settling the 
outback is similar to our settling the west 
elko declared friday australia day in honor of the first 
european settlers who landed in sydney on jan 26 1788 
in celebration the elko high school band played the star 
spangled banner and a version of australias national song 
waltzing matilda written by bush poet andrew barton banjo 
patterson 
more than 7000 people were expected to visit elko population 
25000 through the weekend to hear the lyrical tales

rep augustus f hawkins one of the last new 
dealera liberal democrats still in office is retiring after 
pressing to help the needy during his 27 years in congress 
maybe i can do a better job calling attention to my concerns 
on the outside than on the inside the 82yearold chairman of 
the house education and labor committee said in an interview after 
announcing he would not seek reelection next november 
hawkins the longestserving black in congress said he made the 
decision thursday night with his wife and did not consult with 
party leaders before making the announcement friday 
he said he considered retiring before but there was always 
another project another bill i wanted to see passed so i just 
kept going on 
hawkins has represented the primarily black and hispanic watts 
area of los angeles and surrounding hispanic suburbs since 1963 
when he became the first black elected to congress from california 
before that he had been a member of the state legislature since 
1934 
in 1984 he replaced the late rep carl d perkins dky as 
chairman of the education and labor panel his most likely 
successor as the panels chairman is rep william d ford dmich 
sen edward m kennedy dmass who chairs the senate labor and 
human resources committee called hawkins a tireless champion of 
a better and fairer america 
few if any members of congress have done more over the past 
quarter century to fulfill the nations commitment to those who 
need our help the most kennedy said 
narrowing the disparity between rich and poor has always been 
the focus of hawkins agenda 
a year after entering congress he coauthored the 1964 civil 
rights acts title vii which created the equal employment 
opportunity commission and mandated fair employment practices 
in 1978 he was the coauthor with the late sen hubert humphrey 
of the humphreyhawkins full employment bill which officially 
targets an unemployment rate of 4 percent as the nations goal 
but for most of the past decade hawkins was forced into a role 
of tilting at windmills as a critic of the socalled reagan 
revolution 
the adamant liberal with a 100 percent favorable voting record 
from the aflcio six of the past eight years has often taken a 
pragmatic approach in forging alliances with conservatives to 
advance his agenda 
in 1982 he worked with dan quayle then a conservative 
republican senator from indiana and sen orrin hatch rutah to 
assure unions and community activist groups a voice in allocating 
wage subsidies to businesses under the job training partnership act 
i never tried to play the role of superstar thats just not 
my nature hawkins said friday my approach has always been to 
get some tangible results you cant let your ego stand in the 
way 
last year he and hatch joined to emphasize early schoolbased 
education for 3 and 4yearolds as part of a multibilliondollar 
child care bill that remains stymied because of opposition from 
bush and conservative democrats 
hawkins said he fears a compromise may produce two systems 
one in which the poor will go to inferior care facilities and the 
wealthy will be able to take care of their own children 
hawkins complained that bush while touting himself as the 
education president has consistently opposed appropriating the 
money needed to carry out an 83 billion school improvement act 
that hawkins wrote and former president reagan signed two years ago 
its the same old story theres just no money he said 
if we only implemented that law as it should be education would 
be at the top of the agenda instead were moving in just the 
opposite direction fooling around with fads

of the proposal were disclosed friday in advance of president 
bushs release of the fiscal 1991 budget 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate veterans 
panel added he would strongly oppose all changes in the 
fundamental nature of this important veterans benefit

to boost health care spending for veterans to 123 billion health 
care is the most expensive service provided to the nations 27

according to the veterans department 178000 guaranteed loans 
will be closed in this fiscal year va borrowers may make a form of 
down payment in order to bring the loan down to an amount they 
can afford or if the home purchase should exceed 184000 
according to warren lasko executive vice president of the 
mortgage bankers association of america 70 percent of va loans 
have no down payment lasko said the proposal is part of an attempt 
that began in the reagan administration to throttle the 
program but the down payment proposal is a new wrinkle 
if the 4 percent proposed down payment to the va home loan 
above 25000 is part of the budget it represents a drastic change 
in the very concept and intent of the 45yearold va home loan 
program said larry w rivers executive director of the veterans 
of foreign wars 
he called it an unreasonable an unfair proposal which dashes 
the dreams of countless veterans of participating in the american 
dream of home ownership 
lasko said he was equally disturbed by a proposal to raise the 
mortgage indemnity fund fee for borrowers to 175 percent of the 
mortgage from 125 percent that fee which took effect this month 
to provide a new fund to insure against bad mortgages replaces a 1 
percent borrowers fee that went to the va 
its a standard user fee story comparable to the social 
security airport and highway trust funds lasko said critics say 
the government uses those funds to finance the deficit 
veterans organizations were not happy with the health care 
increase arguing 134 billion is needed to keep services in line 
with 1988 levels 
but cranston and montgomery were satisfied 
montgomery said the proposal for health care funding was fair 
and realistic and one of the best weve seen in years

education secretary lauro cavazos is trying to 
put aside rumors of his imminent departure declaring im the 
right person for the job 
never once never once has the president expressed 
dissatisfaction at the way im doing my job or the quality of work 
that is coming out of this department cavazos said friday the 
day the president says pack it up its done ill say yes 
mr president 
the education secretary said in an interview with the cable 
television network the learning channel that he was disappointed by 
criticism about his lowkey management style and his distaste for 
publicity 
if this secretary of education can move this nation into 
thinking about what it must do in the coming decade about 
education what difference does it make whether you have someone 
who shouts yells screams and tears their shirt cavazos said 
i expect them to understand what im saying rather than 
worrying about style style gets you nowhere if shouting and 
carrying on is what they want they got the wrong person for the 
job he said but i know im the right person for this 
job 
criticism of cavazos focuses on his unwillingness to argue for 
raising federal education spending and to use his office as a 
bully pulpit as did his flamboyant predecessor william 
bennett 
since his first day in office cavazos professorial style 
which he said evolved through many years as dean of a medical 
school and president of texas tech university has been compared 
with that of bennett 
cavazos said improving americas schools is a massive project 
that includes giving parents a choice of where to send their 
children to school allowing local officials to manage their own 
affairs and using alternative methods to certify some teachers 
in order to bring this about it means a total restructuring of 
the educational process said cavazos

the picture at new yorks picture newspaper is 
not pretty a costcutting management is set to take on the unions 
in negotiations that could decide the fate of the daily news 
contracts with the papers 10 unions expire march 30 despite 
protests from the unions that they have no intention to strike 
news executives have done little to hide their extensive 
preparations to handle a walkout 
john t sloan the news vice president of human resources 
called it the most critical negotiations in our history 
the fundamental issue in these contract negotiations revolves 
around the survival of the new york daily news because over the 
last 10 years we have lost over 115 million in over 4 billion in 
revenue he said 
sloan said the paper wants to cut labor abuses that exist in 
our contracts and has submitted proposals to two unions that 
would cut manpower reduce insurance coverage freeze wages remove 
foremen from the union and eliminate seniority rights except for 
vacations 
the unions are placing equal emphasis on the negotiations 
theodore kheel the unions adviser said it was of critical 
importance to the whole labor movement 
the unions have been unreceptive to daily news proposals 
if they need relief let them come up to the bargaining tables 
like men and say to us where they need the relief said michael 
alvino president of the newspaper and mail delivers union if 
theres waste let them prove where the waste is 
both sides acknowledge that the daily news founded in 1919 
needs to replace aging machinery with automated equipment and color 
presses 
both sides know that the news which still sells more 
newspapers than any other locally circulated general interest 
newspaper in america has lost readers the news once sold more 
than 2 million papers a day it now sells 12 million weekdays and 
14 million on sundays 
analysts say the threetabloid city the new york post and new 
york newsday are the other two can support only one or two 
and both labor and management know that advertising is harder to 
come by as many of the citys big department stores closed in 
recent years 
the concord ends there 
the unions claim the real goal of the news chicagobased 
parent the tribune co is to sell the paper something it tried 
to do in 1982 or fold it news officials deny it 
the news said it wants to spend 300 million to 500 million on 
plants and equipment to replace machinery more than 30 years old 
but labor leaders say the company already has reneged on a 1987 
promise that if the unions made concessions of 30 million it 
would invest 300 million in plants and presses sloan said that 
pledge was never made 
the two sides even dispute whether the newspaper is losing money 
edward atorino an analyst for salomon brothers said the news 
has made a marginal profit of a few million dollars in recent 
years but he said that is not enough the news must streamline its 
operations build a new plant and get rid of inefficiencies in its 
labor contracts 
before the tribune co starts writing some checks they want 
to get a return for their money otherwise they will keep it in 
the bank he said 
if you look at the last two or three years the newspaper 
business has had very good economic periods and many newspapers 
have made a lot of money the news hasnt why because the costs 
are too high 
managements preparation for strife includes the hiring of two 
law firms that unions regard as union busters the news also has 
put up reinforced glass blocked off its composing room with a 
doorway and issued new card keys to employees that limit their 
access to areas they once could enter freely 
the newspaper bought 22 acres in north bergen nj and said it 
intended to use it and 39 acres in syosset ny for future 
expansion 
but the unions say buildings on the new jersey acreage have been 
used to train people on news machinery and would serve as a barbed 
wireenclosed enclave protecting a makeshift newsroom during the 
strike the news acknowledged that training has taken place there 
but said no more 
the news success in weathering a strike would depend on whether 
deliverers worked despite an enticing news proposal that would 
make the drivers into independent operators who could make up to 
250000 a year drivers leader alvino insisted that my union 
will stick 
the new york daily news wants a strike and we have no 
intentions of getting suckered into that alvino said we will 
negotiate negotiate negotiate we have no intentions of putting 
our people in the streets

a federal judge has lifted a ban on drug 
testing for 19 employees in the executive office of the president 
who have top secret security clearances but has continued to 
bar the tests for 10 others with secret clearances 
the employees have filed a lawsuit challenging random mandatory 
urinalysis called for by bush administration officials who declare 
that the employees hold sensitive positions and should be tested 
the employees are in the office of management and budget the 
office of administration and the office of the us trade 
representative 
us district court judge louis oberdorfer said friday that it 
is unlikely that those with top secret clearances will prevail 
in the case although he allowed that portion of the lawsuit to 
proceed 
the judge said the permissibility of subjecting the 10 
others to drug tests is less clear and he kept the ban in place 
the government contends in effect that information classified 
as secret is by definition as truly sensitive as top secret 
information noted the judge 
a 1982 executive order draws the distinction between top secret 
and secret information by saying that disclosure of the former 
could reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave 
damage to the national security disclosure of secret information 
could reasonably be expected to cause serious damage says the 
executive order

gubernatorial candidate john silber said he will 
not apologize for remarks he made about immigrants to massachusetts 
that his opponents and other state officials have labeled as racist 
i think anyone who raised the suggestion that i was either 
hostile to immigrants or in any sense a racist definitely owes me 
an apology silber said friday adding his father was a german 
immigrant 
asked if he owed anyone an apology silber said certainly 
not 
gov michael s dukakis called silbers comments about 
immigrants to the state offensive and pressed him to apologize 
and two of silbers democratic opponents state rep john flood 
and lt gov evelyn murphy renewed their criticism friday after 
expressions of outrage the day before 
it is insidious to make unfair and unwarranted generalized or 
stereotypical comments especially at a time when massachusetts is 
engaged in the delicate task of restoring racial harmony flood 
said 
i would have hoped he could have found an apology today 
murphy said i was offended i think he ought to be reflecting on 
all this long and hard 
silber the president of boston university called the news 
conference friday after controversy arose from an interview 
published in the telegram amp gazette of worcester in which he 
questioned whether the state has become a welfare magnet 
why has massachusetts suddenly become so popular for people 
who are accustomed to living in the tropical climate silber told 
the newspaper 
he also told the newspaper why should lowell be the cambodian 
capital of america it is extraordinary why should they all be 
concentrated in one place this needs to be examined 
at the news conference silber said opponents have taken my 
remarks out of context and twisted them beyond recognition some 
have even suggested that i am racist and hostile to immigrants 
like sen joseph mccarthy who smeared his opponents with the 
charge of communism they have attempted to smear me with the 
charge of racism 
but he did not back away from his views that some people come to 
massachusetts to collect welfare 
some come because of the accessibility and elevation of 
welfare payments that is not a criticism that is a description 
silber said sometimes we have to look at the facts people who 
want to avoid the facts are not going to solve the problems of 
massachusetts 
in addition he accused the news media of poor reporting 
people ought to know the distortion of reporting is so great 
they would be well advised to hold their piece until they could get 
a complete transcript of what one is alleged to have said he 
said

although hes considered a longshot for 
winning his partys gubernatorial nomination miami democrat alcee 
hastings is willing to bet the state is ready to legalize casino 
gambling 
hastings a miami attorney who became floridas first black 
us district judge only to be impeached by the us senate last 
year said friday he favors changing the florida constitution to 
allow casino gambling with profits helping the state meet its 
growth needs 
similar efforts to legalize casino gambling failed in 1978 and 
1986 
its a new idea one that will at least meet with some 
resistance but i believe with some favorable responses as well 
said hastings 
one of those resisting is us rep bill nelson one of three 
democratic gubernatorial hopefuls 
you look at the other states that have horse racing and then 
you look at the states that have casino gambling and theres a 
distinct attitude atmosphere and element that is attracted to 
casino gambling that i dont think fits the familyoriented high 
technologyoriented businessoriented atmosphere of our state 
nelson said friday 
hastings plan would locate casinos in 10 regions of the state 
blocking out only a threecounty area around walt disney world 
because of its reputation as a family recreational center 
we have serious revenue needs said hastings who will seek 
his partys nomination in a sept 4 primary against nelson and 
state sen george stuart 
he said half of the casino profits would go to education with 
the other half split between crime prevention and general revenue

portauprince haiti ap haitis military ruler lt gen 
prosper avril says he is lifting a 30day state of siege under 
which security forces rounded up dozens of political activists and 
forced at least seven into exile 
in a speech friday night carried live on state radio and 
television avril said the state of siege would be withdrawn 
tuesday 18 days early in view of the positive results already 
obtained 
it was unclear whether avril was bowing to diplomatic pressure 
or simply felt he had effectively stifled open opposition to his 
16monthold regime 
the announcement came the same day the french government said it 
was suspending economic assistance and talks on a 500 million aid 
package for haiti one of the worlds poorest nations to protest 
avrils crackdown on his political opponents 
the 12nation european economic community also issued a strongly 
worded protest friday 
avril has also been under pressure from the bush administration 
which denounced the state of siege as a blatant assault on basic 
civil liberties the united states suspended 60 milion in annual 
direct aid to haiti after an election massacre in 1987 
in his speech avril did not say whether the seven exiled 
opposition leaders would be allowed to return however the 
interior and defense minister brig gen fritz romulus said 
earlier in the week that the seven could take part in elections 
scheduled for next fall 
avril also did not say whether censorship imposed on independent 
radio and television stations would be lifted along with the siege 
declaration 
the military leader wearing his uniform and sitting at his desk 
at the national palace addressed the nation before the start of 
the 10 pm news on state tv he read from a prepared text in 
french rather than creole the language of 90 percent of haitis 
57 million people 
the state of siege was imposed on jan 20 one day after 
unidentified gunmen killed army col andre neptune his wife and 
their housemaid 
avril who attended neptunes funeral friday blamed the 
assassination on unspecified terrorists and anarchists in 
apparent reference to the exiled opposition leaders avril said 
political demagogues had helped create a climate of insecurity 
in the country 
among the politicians forced into exile were dr louis roy one 
of the main authors of the 1987 constitution and hubert de 
ronceray a prominent conservative and former presidential 
candidate 
they were among an estimated 50 activists arrested and 
reportedly beaten in the military sweep last weekend 
although he did not acknowledge mistreatment by the military 
avril said the furor of the soldiers after neptunes killing 
was understandable 
he said the security forces had been hamstrung by certain 
constitutional guarantees such as a 48hour limit on holding 
suspects without bringing charges 
extraordinary measures were necessary avril said to 
safeguard our young tottering stammering democracy 
critics have accused avril of using the colonels assassination 
as a pretext to suppress opposition and renege on his pledge to 
turn over power to a democratically elected government elections 
are scheduled for oct 28 
but avril reiterated his pledge to hold elections 
the democratic process will not be put into question he 
said on the contrary in a more serene climate the electoral 
machine will advance more securely 
avril gained power in september 1988 when a soldiers rebellion

after waiting more than a year william 
and aleta heidt were ecstatic to learn last week that their plans 
to adopt two children from colombia had finally been approved 
but the joyous anticipation turned into hours of hellish 
desperation for mrs heidt when avianca flight 52 crashed with her 
husband and new son and daughter aboard 
mrs heidt of wyckoff nj went to john f kennedy 
international airport on thursday night carrying two small parkas 
blue and purple for her new children and a camera to take their 
pictures 
the adoptions had taken more than a year to set up and she knew 
her son and daughter blanca beltron 12 and her brother pedro 
10 only from a snapshot 
but avianca flight 52 never arrived and friday morning after a 
night of telephone calls mrs heidt learned that her husband and 
the children were being treated for serious injuries of three 
separate hospitals 
her husband william 51 was in critical condition early today 
at nassau county medical center blanca was moved out of intensive 
care and was reported in stable condition at glen cove hospital 
pedro was in stable condition at north shore university hospital 
adoption agency officials say blanca and pedro may have been 
among many adoptive children aboard the plane 
changes in colombian law that took effect jan 20 have made 
adoption more difficult and there has been a rush among adoptive 
parents in the past week to adopt children there and bring them 
home 
all the orphanages are rushing people through said cheryl 
simon a leader of the latin american parents association a group 
that helps people adopting latinamerican children we have 15 
families down there now due to a combination of new adoption laws 
and courts opening up after christmas break 
hospitals reported treating at least 25 injured children among 
the 89 people who were injured aboard the avianca plane it was not 
clear how many of those children might have been adopted however 
mrs heidt eyes ringed by streaked mascara and clutching a 
silver crucifix said her husband had flown to colombia on sunday 
after they met the jan 20 deadline with help from us rep marge 
roukema in whose district they live 
im selfemployed and we couldnt afford to take the time 
mrs heidt said he went and took vacation from work 
numbed and distracted mrs heidt retreated into silence 
when hes up and healthy and i see his beautiful brown eyes 
then ill feel like talking she said 
she was so excited she has their room ready she left the 
christmas tree up and everything said lucy ferguson a 
travelers aid director who befriended mrs heidt at the airport 
during the desperate hours following the crash 
ms roukema called the air disaster an ultimate irony for 
the heidts 
they have worked so hard over the past year to get these 
children here now to have this tragedy is just unbelievable 
irony

the coalition government has announced 
that parliamentary elections will be held april 8 ending an 
administration that united leftists and conservatives in an uneasy 
partnership 
fridays announcement came after a meeting of the heads of the 
conservative socialist and communist parties with premier xenophon 
zolotas it did not mention whether a caretaker government would 
oversee the vote 
the three parties put aside their differences in november to 
form a temporary goverment and avoid calling immediate new 
elections after inconclusive national voting june 18 and nov 5 
constantine mitsotakis leader of the conservative new democracy 
party insisted that the coalition be shortlived saying it could 
not cope with the pressing economic and foreign policy issues 
facing the country 
the socialists and communists wanted a longerterm government 
but they were unable to muster a parliamentary majority without the 
conservatives 
the government is struggling with 148 percent annual inflation 
and a budget deficit estimated at 16 billion for 1989 
the political deadlock developed when the socialists after 
eight years in office lost the election june 18 amid charges that 
premier andreas papandreou and senior ministers were involved in 
financial and wiretapping scandals 
papandreou has been indicted in connection with the scandals 
but no trial date has been set

the military police and other armed 
units will no longer be under the control of the communist party 
the government and the army announced 
the announcement friday on national television appeared to be an 
effort by the communists who still control the goverment to 
bolster their sagging image before a key party congress starting 
jan 30 
on thursday night the policymaking central committee approved 
a platform for the congress that commits the communists to 
pluralism and social democracy the official bta news agency said 
a showdown is expected at the upcoming congress between 
reformers and more orthodox communists many of whom kept the 
powerful local posts they gained under former leader todor zhivkov 
who was ousted nov 10 and replaced by party leaader petar mladenov 
a 12party coalition of opposition groups the union of 
democratic forces is negotiating with the communists for a greater 
share of power 
on friday bta quoted the unions chairman zhelyo zhelev as 
holding out the possibility his alliance would enter a coalition 
with the communists but only if it were made clear the union did 
not share responsibility for past mistakes under communist rule 
we do not want to share responsibility with people who are 
guilty zhelev told bta 
according to a decree made public friday no political parties 
will be allowed to operate in the future in the army and in 
subdivisions of the interior ministry including the police 
in practice that means abolition of communist party control 
because it has been the only party allowed to function in those 
organizations 
the decree by the state council bulgarias collective 
presidency made clear that individuals in the army and police 
force may continue membership in the party at their place of 
residence 
defense ministry spokesman radnyu minchev disclosed under a 
resolution of the partys eightmember politburo dated wednesday 
all communist political organs and komsomol or communist youth 
organizations are being abolished in the army 
this is proof of the partys renunciation of its monopoly on 
power he declared 
minchev said that under an emerging multiparty system it is 
inadmissible to wage a political fight within the army 
lyuben gotsev first deputy interior minister said all 
committees and organizations of the communist party and komsomol 
that are under his ministrys control will be dissolved such as 
the police border troops and fire departments 
also friday a oneweek strike of virtually all bulgarian mines 
was suspended pending negotiations involving the official trade 
unions the independent union podkrepa and mining management 
the tv report on the suspension did not say how many miners 
struck but noted that 14 strike committees joined in the protest 
for higher pay better retirement terms and greater safety on the 
job 
numerous strikes have increased social tensions in this balkan 
nation as it moves toward democracy

the crew of a colombian jetliner was 
worried about running low on fuel just before the plane crashed 
killing 72 people federal investigators say 
national safety board member lee dickinson told a news 
conference friday that the crew on a voice recorder recovered from 
the wreckage expressed concern several times about fuel levels 
after an aborted landing attempt 
but the pilot did not declare an emergency landing priority that 
would have required controllers to immediately clear avianca 
airlines flight 52 for a landing thursday night he said 
although many clues indicate the plane had little or no fuel 
when it crashed into a hill on the north shore of long island 
federal investigators would not say that the crash was caused by 
the plane running out of fuel 
no homes were hit and there were no casualties on the ground 
though one part of the plane came to rest on a homes patio 
dickinson said 89 people survived the crash 
investigators picking through the wreckage of the boeing 707 in 
the woods of the isolated wealthy suburb of cove neck said the 
fuel gauges indicated the jet had 10000 pounds or 1500 gallons 
of fuel dickinson said investigators had not yet checked the 
tanks 
boeing spokesman jack gamble in seattle said that could have 
been enough fuel to fly the jet from the crash site to its 
destination kennedy international airport but not much more 
the airport is about 15 miles away 
the flight from bogota tried to land in fog and rain at 924 
pm but aborted the attempt because of electronic warnings that 
the plane was sinking too fast and approaching at an improper 
angle dickinson said 
the crew asked the airports traffic controller for permission 
to try again 
they said they were running out of fuel or they were low 
on fuel dickinson said 
the tower gave directions the crew repeated that the plane was 
running low on fuel the crew then reported two engines out 
the jet disappeared from the radar screens at 934 pm he said 
the colombian radio network rcn has reported that the 
23yearold plane had been sent to the maintenance shop 37 times in 
the past four months dickinson said he had no information to 
confirm the planes maintenance record 
more than 12 hospitals worked friday to treat survivors at 
least 25 of the injured survivors were either in serious or 
critical condition and more than two dozen children were among the 
injured 
dickinson said only nine of the dead had been identified only 
one member of the crew the chief steward survived the crash 
survivors said the plane circled for more than hour before the 
crash 
nbc news reported that the plane ran into delays along the east 
coast and was put in a holding pattern over norfolk va and twice 
over new jersey for 75 minutes dickinson and a faa spokeswoman 
said they could not confirm that 
one passenger colombian businessman jorge lozano said there 
was no warning before the crash 
i had time to say a prayer in about five seconds we were 
crashing into the trees said lozano who suffered a cracked 
spine 
scores of emergency workers from as far away as new york city 
laid ladders up the steep wooded hillside where part of the 
fuselage came to rest then passed survivors down 
what a way to come to america one of the passengers told 
rescue worker jay krul 30 of oyster bay 
several factors show the plane may have run out of fuel no fire 
on impact the lowspeed landing the lack of fuel odor and the 
angle of the nose wings and body which came down level instead of 
thrusting forward as they would have if the engines were running 
among the injured were a number of children who were bound for 
adoption in the united states 
a lot of the kids we got out alive said rescuer charles 
harris 
the crash occurred a quartermile from the home where the 
parents of tennis pro john mcenroe live their lawn was used as a 
makeshift morgue 
dickinson said there was no evidence thus far of sabotage 
one victim of thursdays crash appeared to have a cocaine 
connection however daniel rossett a spokesman for north shore 
university hospital said surgeons at work on a 30yearold victim 
who suffered abdominal injuries found condoms believed packed with 
cocaine in the mans intestines 
the man was in critical condition

a nobegging rule in the subway is 
unconstitutional because the first amendment applies to panhandling 
as much as any other form of speech a federal judge declared 
us district judge leonard sand invalidated regulations of the 
transit authority which runs the subways and the port authority 
of new york and new jersey which prohibits begging in the world 
trade center and the port authority bus terminal 
he ruled friday that the bans should be rewritten to include 
reasonable time place and manner restrictions 
the authorities can forbid begging on moving vehicles and near 
token booths narrow platforms and on stairs and escalators sand 
said 
it is the total prohibition of all begging on all of the 
defendants facilities which is constitutionally impermissible 
he said 
the lawsuit was brought by two homeless men who beg in the 
citys subway system their lawyer george summers said the ruling 
was the first time a federal court had determined that begging is 
protected by the first amendment 
summers had argued that begging is nothing more than one person 
asking another a question the judge adopted that approach sand 
wrote 
the simple request for money by a beggar or a panhandler 
cannot but remind the passerby that people in the city live in 
poverty and often lack the essentials for survival 
even the beggar sitting in grand central station with a tin 
cup at his feet conveys the message that he and others like him are 
in need while often disturbing and sometimes alarmingly graphic 
begging is unmistakably informative and persuasive speech 
douglas lasdon an attorney with the legal action center for the 
homeless said the judges ruling reaffirms the principle that in 
this country you cannot solve a social problem by silencing poor 
people 
sands ruling stemmed from a classaction lawsuit filed nov 28 
by lasdons group on behalf of homeless and needy people 
spokeswomen for the transit authority and port authority 
declined to comment saying their lawyers were reviewing the 
decision 
the transit authoritys begging ban was part of its program to 
enforce set rules for subway conduct the lawsuit claimed the 
program was designed to roust the homeless from the subway 
the judges decision came at a time of heightened scrutiny of 
safety issues raised by the presence of homeless people in the 
subway 
on sunday a man who was waiting with his 3yearold son at a 
manhattan station was spat at and punched by a homeless man police 
said he turned on the homeless man hit him on the head and beat 
his head on the platform killing him the man was charged with 
firstdegree manslaughter

rat is 
the march and subsequent rallies at the picket site and a union 
camp were the largest gatherings of umw miners since june when a 
rally in charleston attracted more than 1000 miners the union 
said

day during june and july more than 43000 miners in 10 states 
walked off their jobs in violation of other union contracts many 
took days off work on friday 
miners struck rum creek in midaugust after it reopened the 
preparation plant with nonunion contractors 
state troopers had advised the miners not to block the public 
road 
the union already was under court order not to block an adjacent 
private road leading to the plant many of the miners said they 
were prepared to be arrested 
two umw members were charged on wednesday with assaulting 
federal officers and released thursday three other miners have 
been charged with violating a court order 
the rum creek strike is not related to the 9monthold strike 
against the pittston coal group which was tentatively settled jan 
1 the proposed pact has not yet been submitted for ratification by 
the rank and file

with 12 chimes of a 500yearold bell the beat 
of a drum and a deafening roar of firecrackers beijing welcomed 
the year of the horse today 
at the stroke of midnight the citys mayor chen xitong struck 
the 500yearold bronze bell chinas largest and heaviest a 
dozen times residents set off a hail of firecrackers and fireworks 
to greet the lunar new year which in china is called spring 
festival 
each lunar year is represented by one of 12 animals of the 
chinese zodiacal calendar the year of the horse follows the year 
of the snake 
as the mayor struck the bell a worker and a soldier nearby beat 
two large red drums atop beijings drum tower but both the drums 
and the bell were drowned out by the cacophony of firecrackers that 
lasted unbroken for about 15 minutes 
the sounding of the bell and drum revived an imperial tradition 
and the official xinhua news agency said they would be sounded on 
the eve of every spring festival the bell and drum towers were 
timekeepers for imperial beijing but neither has been used for 66 
years since the last emperor left the imperial palace 
in the old society thats how we knew the time said a 
60yearold native of beijing who lives near the two towers the 
woman who did not give her name said it was the first time she 
had heard the bell or the drum since 1949 when the communists took 
power 
also at midnight premier li peng and communist party chief 
jiang zemin gave their holiday greetings on television the unusual 
appearance was part of an annual prerecorded fourhour new years 
eve variety show one of chinas mostwatched television shows 
the chinese leadership earlier this week traveled to the 
provinces to bring spring festival holiday greetings to workers and 
to thank soldiers for their role in putting down last springs 
prodemocracy movement 
during a sixday tour of shanxi province in northern china 
jiang emphasized the role of the working class and said socialism 
will triumph in china if we learn from their spirit of fearing 
no hardship and quietly contributing to the country and the 
people 
such exhortations have been common in the wake of last years 
prodemocracy movement which was violently crushed by the 
military hundreds perhaps thousands of people died 
this years spring festival celebrations in beijing seemed more 
subdued than in past years when the sound of firecrackers could be 
heard all night long 
traditionally chinese set off firecrackers for almost any 
special occasion but especially at the lunar new year because it 
is supposed to ward off evil spirits 
beijing was bustling for most of the day as shoppers made their 
final purchases for the long weekend 
huge quantities of food have been brought into the capital to 
ensure bounty for the holiday and in recent days the chinese 
media have been filled with reports of an abundent food supply 
throughout the country 
beijing stores were stocked with 370 million worth of food and 
other unspecified commodities xinhua reported 
fruits from temperate climates like oranges and bananas and 
even kiwi were on sale and xinhua reported that more than 50 
kinds of vegetables have been shipped from southern china 
the news agency said prices for some fruits was down by 20 
percent from last year inflation which peaked at an annual rate 
of 36 percent in 1988 has been a major complaint among the 
chinese and the government has scrapped plans to cut back on 
subsidies 
tens of thousands of people turned out for the first day of the 
longtan park temple fair according to a woman at the ticket 
window but inside vendors selling toys and snacks complained that 
the turnout was lower than expected 
the fair offered a variety of beijingstyle snacks from 
spicy pancakes to small deepfried eggs on a stick to candied crab 
apples as well colorful plastic trinkets and household goods 
gamblers could try their hand at a portable roulette table 
which offered lux soap and hilton cigarettes as prizes and 
children could ride in a dogdrawn cart for about 20 cents

the highflying blackbird 
spy plane which flew faster than a bullet was officially grounded 
after a quartercentury of service 
the sr71 is an aircraft that has truly reached out and 
touched the face of god gen john chain jr chief of the 
strategic air command said friday referring to a famous poem 
about flight 
the crews who took the plane to record heights at speeds of 
2100 mph are true american heroes chain said at blackbirds 
retirement ceremony attended by about 1000 people 
the daggershaped planes which the air force calls the worlds 
fastest and highest flying airplane were permanently grounded in 
november 
the unarmed twinengine planes capable of photographing a 
vehicle license plate from 15 miles above the earth will be 
exhibited at museums across the nation 
for me its a sad day said ben rich a lockheed corp vice 
president who helped design the blackbird 
i was there at its birth rich said im here at its 
retirement we gave the world its finest but we must go on 
a federal budget measure signed last year by president george 
bush deleted more than 200 million for the aging blackbirds 
critics in congress said the loss of the more versatile sr71 
will leave a gap in us surveillance capabilities 
its not that theres no need for it its just that were 
constrained by money lt col rod dyckman said after flying an 
sr71 this will all hit me a little later that this was my last 
flight 
the nine existing sr71s surrounded the stage at the ceremony 
originally the air force had 30 blackbirds officials said some 
crashed and others simply wore out 
the blackbirds destinations include the national air and space 
museum in washington dc and the air force museum at 
wrightpatterson air force base in ohio 
other air force base museums scheduled to receive the blackbirds 
will be offutt in nebraska lackland in texas robins in georgia 
and edwards march and castle in california

northeast of san francisco the aircraft also operated out of air 
fields in mildenhall england and kadena air base in okinawa 
its pilots and navigators who wore spacesuits during flight 
say they have been attacked numerous times by missiles fired from 
ground forces or jet fighters 
the plane was the first to employ the stealth or radarevading 
technology that is the hallmark of the nations newest military 
aircraft 
nearly three decades after the first blackbirds were built by 
lockheed the jets still hold world records for speed and altitude 
the blackbirds top capabilities remain secret but the air 
force says it flies to more than 85000 feet at more than 2100 mph 
or over three times the speed of sound thats roughly 35 miles a 
minute faster than a bullet fast enough to streak from san 
francisco to new york in 1 hour 45 minutes

he embraced the notion of selfreliance put forth by whitman and 
emerson he also was inspired by melville and thoreau who stressed 
the virtues of humanism and a personalized society 
the test of maturity for nations as well as individuals is

return to human feelings and moral values

wanted to destroy machinery with the hope of bringing back a 
preindustrial society 
what he feared he said was science without conscience and a 
dominant minority of those people who had mastered high 
technology holding power over others as a result

scottish town planner whose influence he called the most important 
in his life

a circuit court jury has found a tampon maker 
responsible for a womans death from toxic shock syndrome in 1978 
and has ordered it to pay her family 905750 
the jury deliberated 11 hours over two days before deciding on 
friday that johnson amp johnson consumer products inc maker of ob 
tampons was responsible for the death of donna marie davis of 
decatur 
ten years ago toxic shock syndrome was linked to dozens of 
womens deaths and studies suggesting that tampons were a major 
cause prompted scores of lawsuits against tampon makers 
ms davis 31 was using the ob tampons just prior to her 
death said attorney john nickley who tried the case for the 
womans estate 
spokesmen for johnson amp johnson said the company will appeal the 
verdict the spokesmen said the company believes the tampon brand 
is safe and was no factor in the womans death 
toxic shock syndrome is a rare but sometimes fatal condition 
linked to tampon use the common bacterium staphylococcus aureus 
can use tampons as a breeding site in the body and produce 
poisonous waste which can enter the bloodstream and cause the 
illness 
ms davis died sept 2 1978 after suffering from vomiting 
diarrhea fever and a rash all are symptoms of toxic shock 
syndrome 
the verdict means more to me than the award does said ms 
davis husband harold 46 who owns and operates a service 
station we have tried to find an answer to why she died for 12 
years we wouldnt rest until we found the answer and now we feel

the states corrections commissioner 
fired the suspended superintendent of the camp hill prison for his 
actions during a threeday riot that left 123 people injured and 
much of the institution in ruins 
the dismissal of robert freeman on friday came shortly after 
gov robert p casey recommended the action citing a commission 
report that was sharply critical of management decisions during the 
riot in october 
in addition to the injuries the rioting caused about 14 
million in damage 
prison administrators declared the prison secure after a first 
night of rioting oct 25 but inmates were able to free themselves 
and continued their rampage though oct 27 
on nov 1 the associated press reported guards had complained 
that prison officials ignored warnings of celllocking mechanisms 
being broken after the first night of rioting 
freeman was suspended the day the report was made his telephone 
number is unpublished and he could not be reached for comment 
the extreme seriousness of the camp hill incident requires 
that those having responsibility for security at camp hill be held 
accountable for their actions casey said 
corrections department spokesman kenneth robinson said the 
dismissal was effective immediately he said acting superintendent 
jeffrey beard would remain at work at the prison 
prison commissioner david s owens jr acting on caseys 
recommendation also fired camp hills deputy for operations 
robert smith terry henry deputy for treatment will be reassigned 
within the department an action also taken at caseys request 
robinson said 
casey said he also would have recommended the dismissal of maj 
john stover captain of the guard but stover had resigned owens 
who had been criticized in the commission report for a 
handsoff approach to dealing with the riot was not sanctioned 
by casey 
the governor on friday cited the findings of the adams 
commission an independent threemember panel that concluded 
management at camp hill failed to adequately search the prison 
after the first night of rioting and failed to assure that cells 
were locked when the guards said they werent secure 
the commission which presented its report in december also 
found that supervisory personnel failed to keep an adequate force 
of state troopers at the prison to prevent a second night of 
rioting and that ample time was available for management to 
reconsider its decisions which did not happen 
state rep jerry l nailor said he was perplexed if the firings 
were based on the commission report because the panel recommended 
no dismissals 
conflicting testimony during house and senate hearings from 
guards and officials at camp hill have raised more questions than 
theyve answered he said 
im wondering what information the governor has now that the 
rest of us havent heard nailor said

a new treatment for aids that involves 
removing stimulating and then reinjecting certain white blood 
cells has the potential to stabilize patients immune systems a 
researcher said 
its taking advantage of ones natural defense against the 
virus said dr monto ho chairman of infectious diseases and 
microbiology at the university of pittsburghs graduate school of 
public health 
ho who is heading what is believed to be the nations only 
clinical trials of the new treatment said researchers plan to 
remove white blood cells that attack cells infected with the aids 
virus the removed cells will be treated with stimulants and 
incubated for two weeks so they can multiply 
the activated cells called killer tcells then will be 
injected back into the patient from whom they were taken 
the treatment is being administered to only one person although 
the sixmonth study calls for six to be tested 
the purpose is to really see if its toxic ho said if 
its not toxic a bigger program will be initiated to find out if 
it will really kill the infected cells whether it will do that we 
dont know 
researchers hope the activated killer tcells or cd8 cells 
will kill or at least inhibit the growth of aidstainted cells and 
fight other infections afflicting aids patients the national 
institute of allergy and infectious diseases is financing the study 
what happens to the immune systems in aids patients it keeps 
going down and eventually they die ho said if you can 
stabilize the immune system by restricting the infected cells then 
you have something 
the patient who has undergone the treatment was diagnosed about 
a year ago with aids and has received three infusions in the past 
six weeks he has shown no signs of acute toxicity ho said 
dr jeffrey laurence director of the laboratory for aids 
research at cornell university said researchers must make sure the 
removed cells cannot harbor the virus 
if they make certain theyre not multiplying the virus along 
with the killer cells it sounds like a very good idea and 
something worthy of a clinical trial laurence said 
some aids patients however already have an expanded pool of

the colombian jetliner that crashed on 
long island ny killing 72 people was 23 years old and had been 
sent for maintenance 37 times in the last four months a national 
radio network said 
the rcn network quoted unidentified airport sources in its 
report friday on the maintenance problems of the fourengine boeing 
707 
colombias civil aviation authority does not permit news media 
to review aircraft maintenance records but rcn indicated it spoke 
to someone with access to the records 
it gave no further details on the maintenance records such as 
what the problems were and whether any regulations had been 
violated 
the plane which had 161 people on board crashed thursday night 
in cove neck long island as it was approaching john f kennedy 
international airport in new york the flight originated in bogota 
and stopped in medellin 
avianca and airport officials have declined to comment on the 
possible cause of the accident 
some reports said the plane had lost use of an engine but 
alfredo parra a airline pilot instructor inteviewed in bogota 
said the aircraft could have continued to fly even if it lost two 
engines 
why the aircraft didnt try to land at an alternate airport 
even if one or two of its engines was inoperative is an important 
question to be asked in the investigation parra said in an 
interview with the caracol radio network 
colombian aviation experts said investigators should try to 
determine why the plane which some reports said ran out of fuel 
was circling new york instead of heading for an alternative airport 
where weather conditions were better it was raining the night of 
the crash 
a veteran avianca pilot noted the pilot had to abort his first 
landing attempt he said that when this happens and the 707 must 
gain altitude quickly without much fuel left the remaining fuel 
is forced to the back of tanks and may cause engines to shut off 
he spoke to the associated press on condition of anonymity 
however a preliminary investigation showed that 10000 pounds 
of fuel were left in the airplane tanks national transportation 
safety board spokesman lee dickinson said friday night in new york 
dickinson said there were indications that at least three of the 
four engines were not working at the time of the crash 
an avianca spokeswoman who would identify herself only as 
mercedes told the ap by telephone that the 52yearold pilot 
laureano caviedes worked for avianca since 1962 the copilot 
mauricio klotz 27 for 3 years and the flight engineer matias 
moyano rojas 44 for 24 years

defense attorneys in the mcmartin preschool 
molestation case blasted the prosecutor judge and news media after 
winning acquittals in the nations longest criminal trial 
attorneys daniel g davis and dean r gits who represent ray 
buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey said friday they 
plan to file misconduct complaints with the state bar association 
against the chief prosecutor 
they accused deputy district attorney lael rubin of unfairly 
blocking bail for mrs buckey 
shes not fit to have a license to practice law davis said 
of ms rubin i am the prosecutor now 
ms rubin said davis has a history of making outrageous 
unfounded and unproven allegations 
i look forward with a lot of good feelings about mr davis 
claiming hes going to refer an investigation to the state bar 
she said i think its a wonderful idea and i look forward to 
complete vindication 
the defense lawyers also said the news media reported the case 
inaccurately they said they believed that the reports led some to 
conclude the defendants were guilty 
gits said he counted 19 people who heard every day of evidence 
in the case twelve were jurors the rest were lawyers the judge 
and court personnel 
but he noted that tv stations which took polls of their viewers 
found that 70 percent to 80 percent believed the verdicts were 
wrong 
what the viewers were reflecting was media dissemination of 
the case he said the public had made up its mind the 
defendants were guilty thats a terrible terrible thing 
the buckeys were cleared of 52 molestation charges last week 
the jury deadlocked on 13 other charges against buckey 
the district attorneys office must decide by wednesday whether 
it will retry the former preschool instructor on those charges 
rubin said she has been consulting with children and their 
parents on the matter 
davis also criticized the posttrial tv appearances of superior 
court judge william pounders 
i am saddened to see the trial judge in this case with 
litigation still pending trooping about in television land like 
a lightweight bit actor making comments about the children 
davis said 
pounders could not be reached for comment by telephone after 
business hours friday

an elementary school principal whose drug arrest 
touched off investigations into city school boards has been 
convicted of crack possession 
it was not unexpected said matthew barnwell as he left the 
court after the jury convicted him he faces a year in jail and a 
1000 fine when judge william leibovitz sentences him on march 9 
this was a sad duty said hope hagler 43 an attorney and 
teacher who was on the manhattan criminal court jury that convicted 
barnwell we were all upset he was a fine gentleman who gave in 
to a weakness 
civil liberties attorney william kunstler who represented 
barnwell said there are enormous grounds for appeal he cited 
leibovitzs refusal to permit the jury to visit the site of the 
alleged crack purchase 
the judge allowed the visit in the last trial which ended with 
a jury hung 42 for acquittal barnwells first trial ended in a 
mistrial before testimony began 
barnwell 56 was arrested on nov 11 1988 minutes after he 
bought two 2vials of crack from a new york street dealer 
his arrest sparked an investigation of local school boards when 
it was revealed that he had kept his job as principal of public 
school 53 in the bronx for 16 years despite a long record of 
absenteeism and tardiness 
barnwell was fired two weeks ago by his local school board 
which carried out the recommendation of a disciplinary panel that 
found barnwell had betrayed his pupils and the enormity of his 
act is clear

pope john paul ii told 
citizens of this impoverished island nation today that there is 
no shame in being poor 
later he left for guineabissau the second country on his tour 
of africas subsaharan nations 
in a farewell speech to president aristides pereira other 
officials and hundreds of faithful the roman catholic leader said 
i know the difficult problems that cape verde like other 
countries of this region has to solve and solve urgently 
but i also know you can count on the tried and tested spirit 
of your people who hold no illusions that the fight against the 
inclement climate and adverse social conditions will be easy 
he reminded the people of this atlantic island nation of a local 
proverb there is no shame in being poor 
in his final speech friday to tens of thousands in this onetime 
slavetrading center the pontiff appealed for an end to 
discrimination and modernday slavery of all kinds 
the pontiff was on his first visit to this 10island archipelago 
about 380 miles west of senegal in west africa he is on an 
eightday tour of africas subsaharan sahel region which has long 
been plagued by drought famine and the spread of the desert 
the 45th trip of the popes 11year papacy will also take him to 
mali burkina faso and chad 
speaking at an openair mass on quebra canela beach near the 
capital cidade da praia the pontiff said the former portuguese 
colony still bore historic scars from the abominable commerce of 
human beings 
looking down from a custombuilt altar onto the crowded black 
volcanic beach john paul said his message was no to 
discrimination of any kind never slavery of man by man never 
again any form of violence that degrades human dignity 
this island nation although arid and poor appears more 
prosperous than other countries of the region thanks mainly to 
foreign aid and money sent back by thousands of islanders who live 
and work abroad 
the united states provides 6 million a year to cape verde 
making it the secondhighest recipient per capita of us foreign 
aid in africa after egypt diplomats said 
up to 700000 cape verdians nearly double the island 
population of 360000 live and work abroad mainly in the united 
states portugal france the netherlands and italy up to 400000 
are estimated to live in massachusetts and rhode island 
the islands of cape verde first prospered in the 16th century as 
a major post for the portuguese empires slave trade between africa 
and the americas with the demise of the slave trade the largely 
desolate islands slid into decline as a colony of an increasingly 
isolated empire 
cape verde gained independence from portugal in 1975 
speaking in wind and rain the pontiff also warned thousands of 
young islanders gathered at praias sports stadium against another 
form of slavery 
he cautioned against moral slavery that threatens you most 
when you are the least aware persuaded by the subtle 
influence of the latest fashion or the dominant opinion 
john paul urged youths not to follow the idols of personal 
success power riches and eroticism

black workers of the state 
transport company today halted one of south africas most violent 
strikes a 12week walkout marked by widespread sabotage and more 
than 35 killings 
the union failed to win even part of its requested 150 percent 
pay increase but south african transport services agreed to 
recognize the union and rehire all of the more than 23000 strikers 
who were fired 
officials of the company and the south african railway and 
harbor workers union signed the settlement today at a ceremony in 
johannesburg afterward they said they hoped for smoother 
relations after two strikes in a threeyear period 
in the latest strike the workers walked out nov 2 demanding 
that the minimum monthly wage be increased from 240 to 600 
numerous battles between strikers and nonstrikers followed 
including one clash between hundreds at a train station near 
johannesburg railway coaches and tracks were sabotaged in dozens 
of incidents and the company said it suffered property damage of 
16 million 
one key issue in the dispute was whether the transport service 
would officially recognize the strikers union the company 
maintained the union had not followed proper procedures for 
recognition and insisted on bargaining with a smaller black union 
not tied to the militant congress of south african trade unions 
jay naidoo general secretary of the congress said at the 
signing ceremony today that the settlement laid the basis for a 
sound relationship between the union and the transport service 
however the conservative partys transport spokesman jurg 
prinsloo said it is shocking that after one of the most violent 
strikes the strikers have again been installed in their 
posts 
the walkout was illegal under legislation that bars strikes in 
essential services the transport company employs about 170000 
people and runs rail and harbor operations nationwide

troops arrested suspected moslem 
militants and searched houses today as they continued a weeklong 
crackdown on secessionist violence in indianheld kashmir that has 
killed more than 70 people 
sporadic gunfire was heard late friday night but there was no 
word of new casualties 
a senior police official said soldiers in the northern indian 
city of srinagar were still looking for diehard terrorists who 
slipped in despite a tough 24hour curfew 
at least 72 people mostly curfewdefying protesters have been 
killed since jan 20 in srinagar and surrounding towns the 
separatists want to secede from predominantly hindu india and 
establish an independent kashmiri nation or join the neighboring 
islamic country of pakistan 
the situation is well under control said jitendra narain 
saxena the top police official in jammukashmir state by 
telephone we have enforced very strict curfew because we have 
information that diehard terrorists have infiltrated into 
srinagar 
as a result of search operations friday night and early today 
some arrests have been made saxena said he refused to give 
any numbers 
a virtual news blackout was imposed thursday night when local 
officials rescinded journalists curfew passes and warned them that 
they risked arrest or getting shot if they tried to leave their 
hotel most communication with the hotel was cut off at the same 
time 
on friday while most of india celebrated the 40th anniversary 
of the constitution that marked the founding of the indian 
republic srinagar resembled a ghost town with only military 
patrols and a few officials allowed on the streets 
a gasoline bomb was thrown at soldiers but no one was injured 
according to police sources in jammu the winter capital of 
jammukashmir state 
across the frontier the leader of pakistanheld kashmir 
threatened friday to launch a jihad or islamic holy war unless

sikander hyat khan demanded the united nations take action on 
its 1948 resolution calling for kashmiris to vote on whether they 
want independence or union with either pakistan or india 
the plebiscite was never held and the kashmir question has 
simmered for four decades india and pakistan have gone to war 
twice over kashmir since they became independent from britain in 
1947 
jammukashmir is the only state in india with a moslem majority 
moslems make up 64 percent of the states 5 million people but

east germanys communists today said foreign 
observers should be invited to monitor the nations first 
competitive elections in may as an additional safeguard to 
ensure free balloting 
also today the propaganda chief under ousted communist leader 
erich honecker was arrested and officials were investigating 
charges of high treason against him the official news agency adn 
a frontpage editorial in the party daily neues deutschland said 
having a team of foreign observers monitor the campaign and 
elections would be good and practical 
the paper urged opposition groups to accept the proposal which 
has been proposed to parliament by interim president manfred 
gerlach a member of one of the noncommunist parties in communist 
premier hans modrows coalition government 
even if all precautions are taken for free and fair elections 
an additional safeguard cannot hurt neues deutschland said 
the development is the latest effort by the communists to buoy 
their standing since a prodemocracy revolution toppled honecker on 
oct 18 opened the berlin wall and set up the coalition government 
adn said former propaganda chief joachim herrmann was arrested 
and it quoted the chief prosecutor as saying he was also being 
investigated for his alleged responsibility for the 
unconstitutional media policy of past years 
herrmann 61 was the top propaganda official in the 
nowdissolved communist party central committee a post through 
which the communists controlled national media including 
television and radio 
the office also ordered the arrest of gerhard schuerer former 
head of the state planning commission on corruption charges adn 
said 
herrmann and schuerer the latest officials under honecker to be 
ordered arrested were kicked out of the party jan 20 
new forum the largest opposition movement but one of its most 
diffuse began a twoday congress in east berlin today 
about 150 delegates of a breakaway group today gathered in 
karlmarxstadt to form the german forum party a delegate 
frankthomas heinze said the party will advocate freemarket 
concepts and german unity according to adn 
on friday opposition groups agreed to join modrows shaky 
government in an effort to keep it afloat until scheduled elections 
in may 
but the reform forces said they will participate only if all 
members of modrows coalition cabinet renounce their party 
loyalties it was not immediately clear if modrow or the other 
ministers were willing to serve in such a nonpartisan capacity 
the show of unity from a splintered opposition suggested that 
the reformists feel the risk of domestic chaos outweighs their own 
concerns of being tainted by association with the current 
leadership 
it is simply becoming clear that our responsibility is to keep 
the country governable wolfgang schnur chairman of the 
conservative democratic awakening movement said on west germanys 
zdf television 
in joining the government the opposition also seems to be 
hoping it will benefit from any national exposure and get some 
credit for guiding the country through an uncertain reform phase 
until the may 6 vote 
opposition representatives declined to say which ministerial 
posts they will demand when they open talks with modrow on sunday

soviet forces found a weapons arsenal and captured 
azerbaijani nationalist leaders accused of trying to seize control 
of the tense republic soviet media said today 
forty leaders of extremist groups allegedly linked to the 
nationalist azerbaijani peoples front were being held 
komsomolskaya pravda said quoting lt col a sorokovikh a police 
official 
the daily trud said more than 1000 uniforms and a large cache 
of arms were found in the fronts headquarters the newspaper said 
that some leaders of the front had gone underground and were 
preparing new mass disorders 
the tass news agency said that rakhmi gadzhiyev identified as 
one of the leaders of the front had been arrested 
nearly 150 people were detained overnight in the azerbaijani 
capital of baku by soviet troops who intervened last week in an 
effort to quell ethnic bloodshed between christian armenians and 
moslem azerbaijanis 
defense minister dmitri t yazov told soviet journalists in baku 
on friday that troops were forced to enter jan 19 because 
nationalists were trying to take control of the republic earlier 
reports had suggested the occupation was designed to stop attacks 
on minority armenians in baku 
also friday baltic activists said azerbaijani and armenian 
representatives tentatively agreed to negotiate their ethnic 
dispute next week in riga latvia 
however romaldus razhukas a director of the latvian peoples 
front said in a telephone interview from riga that the 
azerbaijanis will hold direct talks only if the armenians renounce 
their claim to part of azerbaijans territory 
the armenians have demanded that the nagornokarabakh region of 
azerbaijan a predominantly armenian enclave be united with 
armenia 
the azerbaijanis want to limit the talks to refugees 
humanitarian issues and securing the withdrawal of soviet troops 
activists in the baltic republics have something of a stake in 
peacefully resolving the ethnic strife in azerbaijan they fear 
that the continued use of force by moscow could set the stage for 
similar intervention in their own proindependence republics of 
latvia lithuania and estonia 
the tass news agency said today it is becoming more difficult to 
find housing for growing numbers of refugees from azerbaijan it 
did not give the nationalities of the refugees but it recent days 
more russians have been fleeing in the face of growing antirussian 
tension 
baku the scene of heavy fighting earlier in the week was 
reported to be calmer today stores were beginning to open 
although there were shortages and long lines trud reported 
strikes continued to paralyze the region with 400 enterprises at a 
standstill in baku alone komsomolskaya pravda reported 
the soviet military intervened after azerbaijani extremists 
began killing armenians living in baku on jan 13 the military 
raid has drawn criticism and support in the country and abroad as 
president mikhail s gorbachev struggles with perhaps the most 
difficult of the nations many crises 
in remarks published by the government newspaper izvestia yazov 
appeared to stress that controlling the political situation was the 
reason for the soviet military action 
he said the peoples front had declared its own state of 
emergency in baku a full day before the soldiers moved in and in 
many regions of the city soviet and party organs had ceased to 
control the situation 
previously gorbachev and other top officials have cited public 
safety dozens of people were killed during antiarmenian riots in 
baku as the reason for the military assault but critics of the 
military move have contended that most of the armenians had been 
evacuated before the army moved into baku azerbaijani nationalists 
have accused moscow of trying to crush their movement 
tass said today that 125 people including 27 soldiers and 
police had died during the assault by soviet forces on baku and 
the ensuing battle with nationalists 
in an interview published today in komsomolskaya pravda yazov 
said that an estimated 40000 weapons were in the hands of the

communist leaders met today to dismantle 
their faltering party and replace it with a prodemocracy group 
party chief mieczyslaw f rakowski announced that he will not lead 
the new organization 
rakowski said it was time for a new generation to take over 
the party which this year relinquished power to the solidarity 
movement after a disastrous defeat in polands freest elections 
since world war ii 
the weekend congress planned to expunge the party of its of 
communist ideology endorse parliamentary democracy and create a 
new social democratic organization 
the party formally known now as the polish united workers 
party hopes its new incarnation will become the main leftwing 
party in a new democratic political spectrum 
i consider it appropriate to pass over the helm to a new 
generation said rakowski at the close of an hourlong speech 
reviewing the partys past and the future at the start of the 
congress i personally am not going to run for leadership of the 
party and i think that comrades of my generation will not do so 
more than 1600 delegates gathered at congress hall in warsaws 
imposing stalinistera palace of culture and science 
the party now claims 2 million members but the group that 
emerges from the congress will be much smaller said party 
politburo member janusz reykowski in an interview thursday 
a schism is possible with either orthodox communists or 
progressives leaving to form their own parties he said 
rakowski appealed to delegates to prevent a split if we want 
to exist as a real force in the polish political scene we should 
not leave the congress hall through different exits he said 
rakowski said he struggled to reform the party since the stalin 
era ended in 1956 but failed because many members clung to old 
ideas and the soviet union interfered with reforms until the 
emergence of mikhail s gorbachev in 1985 
its true that we deserved a good whipping he said of the 
past 
but he said the polish party also deserved credit for being 
braver than its east bloc counterparts in carrying out reforms 
he praised president wojciech jaruzelski the former party chief 
for the decision a year ago to lift the ban on solidarity 
lech walesa leader of the solidarity trade union movement that 
forced polands changes and the communist partys delegation in 
parliament have supported parliament deputy tadeusz fiszbach 54 
to be the reformed partys new leader fiszbach is a former gdansk 
party chief ousted from official positions in the 1980s because he 
opposed the 1981 imposition of martial law 
rakowski 65 said early in january that he also would run for 
the top spot but he appeared to be reconsidering this week in the 
face of opposition from those who argued that the new party stands 
no chance unless it introduces an entirely new leadership 
reykowski had also said it might be time for a clear 
generational change possible candidates include slawomir wiatr 
37 the founder of a liberal faction in the party aleksander 
kwasniewski 35 who is in charge of national sports and 
recreation and leszek miller 43 a party secretary and rakowski 
loyalist 
the communist party was a merger forced by soviet leader josef 
stalin of the communist polish workers party and the polish 
socialist party a leftwing party dating from the 19th century 
that enjoyed broad popular support 
now the party says it wants to give up the communist part of 
that heritage and build on the old socialist tradition

a nationally televised trial began 
today for four former associates of dictator nicolae ceausescu 
charged with participating in a crackdown that led to thousands of 
deaths during the revolution 
one of those on trial former poliburo member ion dinca 
testified he helped ceausescu put into practice the criminal 
measures to suffocate in blood the justified revolution of the 
people 
the four were being tried by a panel of five uniformed military 
judges in a hall seating hundreds of people at the romanian 
military academy in bucharest 
the trial is the first of top associates of ceausescu whose 
brutal 24year rule ended in a popular revolution in december 
prosecuting ceausescu loyalists is a key test of the provisional 
government which is struggling to gain the support of the people 
and has promised free elections in may 
the trial opened one day after the vice president of the 
provisional government resigned claiming that stalinistic 
methods are being used by the nations new leaders 
those on trial include former party secretary emil bobu no 3 
under ceausescu and his wife elena former interior minister tudor 
postelnicu who headed the hated secret police and expolitburo 
members manea manescu and dinca if convicted they could receive 
20year prison sentences 
the four sat together in a box in the courtroom with two 
uniformed guards behind them the trial began with each of the 
defendants asked to list his age background and education the 
charges were then read as the four defendants listened impassively 
then the questioning began 
the charges referred to ceausescu and his wife as the 
authors of the genocide but said the four defendants did not 
act to block the ceausescus from taking illegal actions and 
therefore were guilty of complicity 
the ceausescus were found guilty of grave crimes and 
executed dec 25 among those charges was genocide which officials 
said referred to 60000 people slain during the communist 
dictators regime 
the defendants were not asked at first to plead to the charges 
but were questioned about events leading to orders for the security 
forces to open fire on unarmed demonstrators during the revolution 
the order was given by ceausescu at a meeting of the political 
executive committee of the communist party or politburo on dec 
17 while demonstrators in the western city of timisoara were 
demanding the dictators ouster 
dinca said ceausescu wanted soldiers to fire in the air over the 
heads of demonstrators and at the legs of those who broke into 
stores party headquarters or other institutions 
he said ceausescu then asked if those at the meeting had other 
opinions 
nobody had any other opinions dinca recalled 
he did not make clear how the orders were expanded to shots 
fired at the heads and bodies of demonstrators but accepted 
responsibility for what he called criminal measures 
i gave my help to ceausescu to put into practice the criminal 
measures to suffocate in blood the justified revolution of the 
people he said 
when asked why the revolution was justified dinca said the 
people suffered a lack of constitutional rights human freedom 
a lack of food and medication 
the charge was read out as falling under the section of the 
romanian penal code that says genocide constitutes the action of 
destroying a nation a community or an ethnic group by murder 
western diplomats in bucharest citing witness accounts and 
their own assessments believe 10000 people died in the uprising 
when he resigned friday vice president dumitru mazilu said 
stalinist methods and practices are still being used by the 
provisional government and the press is still directed to destroy 
some people and promote others 
i am convinced that those who have carried out the revolution 
will never accept that it be taken over by people who havent given 
anything of themselves to it he said after reading his 
resignation on radio free europe

a car bomb exploded near the home of 
lebanons top shiite moslem cleric today but the assassination 
attempt failed when the vehicle hit a pile of sand and blew up 
before reaching its target police said 
a police statement said an unidentified driver jumped out of the 
explosivepacked renault12 sedan as it moved into the alley toward 
a west beirut building housing the thirdfloor apartment of sheik 
mohammed mehdi shamseddin 
the car drifted to the left hit a sand rampart roadblock and 
exploded about 150 yards from the house causing no casualties or 
serious damage said the spokesman who cannot be named under 
standing rules 
shamseddin 55 is vice chairman of the higher shiite islamic 
council which leads daytoday spiritual affairs of the 12 
million shiite moslems who make up lebanons largest sect 
shamseddin took over after the councils chairman imam moussa 
sadr mysteriously disappeared in september 1978 during a visit to 
libya 
the police statement said the car was rigged with 55 pounds of 
explosives it exploded at about 630 am in the residential 
district of tallet khayat 
several cars parked in the area were damaged in the explosion 
which also shattered window glass no casualties were reported 
the sheik was at home at the time of the explosion but he was 
not hurt the statement said 
no one claimed responsibility for the car bomb by police count 
80 people were killed and 342 wounded in nine car bombings in 
lebanon last year 
security sources speaking on condition of anonymity said they 
believe the car bombing attack might be an offshoot of the power 
struggle within the shiite community between proiranian 
fundamentalists of hezbollah and the syrianbacked secular amal 
militia 
shamseddin is a moderate who sympathizes with amals chief nabih 
berri who is also minister of water and hydraulic resources in the 
government of president elias hrawi and prime minister salim hoss 
berri is locked in a war of words with former iranian interior 
minister ali akbar mohtashemi the hardliner who founded hezbollah 
when he was ambassador to syria in the early 1980s 
the police spokesman said amal and hezbollah fighters skirmished 
today with machine guns in south lebanons iqlim altuffah 
district but no casualties were reported by police count 98 
people have been killed and 286 wounded since the latest round of 
amalhezbollah clashes began in the province dec 23 
todays explosion came a few days after hrawis government said 
it had worked out a security plan for west beirut calling for the 
withdrawal of all militias broad lines of the plan were worked out 
in three days of talks between hrawi and syrian president hafez 
assad in damascus 
in a joint news conference with assad on tuesday hrawi said the 
security plan would turn beirut into an oasis of peace 
hrawi leads a christianmoslem government that is backed by 
syria which has the largest military presence in lebanon 
christian gen michel aoun whose forces control the christian 
enclave refuses to recognize the government and has vowed to drive 
the syrians from lebanon 
the security plan according to government sources is to be put 
into effect early next week 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said the plan 
calls for troops loyal to hrawis government and lebanese police to 
join and then replace syrian troops in most of west beirut 
no lebanese or syrian forces will deploy in the heart of south 
beiruts slums where underground proiranian factions holding most 
of the 18 western hostages in lebanon are based the source said 
there are eight american hostages including terry a anderson 
41 chief middle east correspondent for the associated press who 
was kidnapped march 16 1985 he is the longest held western 
hostage 
syrian troops moved into west beirut to end three years of 
militia anarchy in february 1987 the militias including 
hezbollah moved out 
however militias streamed back into west beirut last summer 
during six months of artillery duels between the syrians and the 
20000 soldiers of aoun the private armies are blamed for the 
robberies car thefts and holdups that have plagued west beirut 
since their return

winnie mandela said today that 
complications have arisen that may affect the expected release of 
her imprisoned husband african national congress leader nelson 
mandela 
it is quite clear there are a lot of hurdles along the way it 
is quite clear problems have cropped up about his immediate 
release mrs mandela told journalists after a fourhour visit 
with her husband 
she appeared pensive and uneasy in contrast to her exuberance 
three weeks ago when she emerged from a visit beaming with optimism 
that his freedom was imminent 
mandela 71 has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for helping to plan the start of the ancs antigovernment 
sabotage campaign he is the countrys bestknown black leader and 
the government has expressed interest in his offer to mediate in 
negotiations with the anc 
mrs mandela declined to discuss the new complications saying 
im in no position to explain the governments problems 
mrs mandela declined to say whether her husbands status had 
been affected by the publication thursday in an antiapartheid 
newspaper of a lengthy policy statement he wrote last year the 
document defended longterm anc positions including the use of 
violence and urged the government to open negotiations that would 
lead to full political rights for the black majority 
all we can say at this stage was that the release of the 
document was not according to his plan she said 
the government and mandela have confirmed the authenticity of 
the document but justice minister kobie coetsee said friday the 
government is treating with greater importance a secret peace plan 
presented to him and president fw de klerk by mandela in december 
the anc which has the largest following of any black 
organization in south africa has said it would enter negotiations 
if de klerk frees mandela and other political prisoners lifts bans 
on the anc and other outlawed groups ends the state of emergency 
imposed in 1986 and halts political trials and executions 
de klerk has said he would like to remove obstacles to 
negotiations and is expected to address parliament feb 2 about 
the ancs conditions 
despite the complications mrs mandela said arrangements for 
her husbands release were continuing

the release here of the film the 
naked gun has drawn the ire of the iranian embassy which 
demanded it not be shown because of a scene that mocks the 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
a letter sent by the embassy friday to the department of foreign 
affairs said the paramount pictures film insults the memory of 
irans late spiritual leader 
in this film the great personality of our respected leader 
who was the leader of the moslem world has been disgraced the 
letter said the embassy expects the department of foreign 
affairs to stop the showing of this film as well as its 
rescheduling or reshowing in the philippines 
the 1988 movie whose complete title is the naked gun from 
the files of police squad stars leslie nielsen as the incredibly 
incompetent detective lt frank drebin 
in one scene drebin punches a character made to look like 
khomeini and reveals a spiked punk hairdo under his turban 
the philippine daily inquirer on saturday quoted manuel morato 
chief of the movie and television review and classification board 
as saying he had ordered local cinemas to cut the scene 
morato was further quoted as saying that his office had 
initially approved the scene being included because it was done 
in jest and therefore not offensive 
khomeini who died in june 1989 is not the only world leader 
mocked in the movie 
in another scene the police detective grabs a character made to 
look like soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev and rubs off the 
birthmark on his head

furhatted muscovites have been peering through 
the construction fence for weeks at the glowing golden arches 
shimmering in the winter gloom 
a glittering mcdonalds is just about ready to open and it is 
more than a big mac and fries although thats a lot in a country 
of food shortages 
the mcdonalds also is a first taste of what mikhail s 
gorbachevs perestroika can offer it is capitalism and consumerism 
in the middle of moscow its western efficiency friendly service 
a clean brightly lit place to eat things communism hasnt 
offered many soviet citizens 
the grand opening is wednesday and 18yearold oleg mukhin is 
learning how to smile 
were supposed to smile all the time people will think weve 
gone loony said mukhin one of the 630 people hired to run the 
restaurant 
they also are being drilled in such strange western habits as 
actually greeting customers and saying thank you 
the restaurant near pushkin square was 14 years in the planning 
but gorbachevs encouragement of warmer eastwest relations 
foreign investment and modernization made it possible 
if all goes well mcdonalds will show some soviet people that 
life is not all dim cafeterias with greasy tables where rice and 
fatty meat are sold by surly workers 
mcdonalds says mukhin is for people to see how its 
possible to live 
it may also teach mukhin something he thinks he needs to know 
for his future where else can you study capitalism and get paid 
for it he asks 
unlike nearly every other foreign firm that has come to moscow 
since the cold war started warming up mcdonalds will be for 
soviet citizens not just privileged foreigners with hard currency 
lets put a sign right here for rubles only said george 
cohon chairman of mcdonalds of canada and the man behind this 
14year quest as he stepped through the lastminute sawdust 
just like the ones they have on the dollar stores that say for 
foreign currency only 
mcdonalds of canada says it spent 50 million to enter the 
soviet market building not just a restaurant but its own dairy 
bakery sauce kitchens and meatprocessing plant to ensure steady 
supplies primarily from soviet sources 
cohon said customers will pay about three rubles about two 
hours pay for an average soviet worker or a starting mcdonalds 
employee for a famous beeg mak 
for foreign tourists thats cheap about 50 cents at the 
special tourist exchange rate 5 at the official commercial rate 
but even the king of the fastfood franchises cant promise 
muscovites a quick bite to eat police maj gen nikolai myrikov 
better known in the neighborhood for directing roundups of 
dissidents on pushkin square stopped by this week to plan crowd 
control for a line expected to stretch so far that it will take a 
couple of hours to get to the door 
still it will be a real line in soviet parlance a line 
that moves as opposed to the dozens that just keep people waiting 
forever such as the 17year wait for a phone as the biggest 
mcdonalds in the world it is designed to serve 1250 people an 
hour 
a second mcdonalds out of a planned 20 will sell for hard 
currency and cater to a foreign community that would rather pay 
more than stand in line 
the hamburger chain also will give hundreds of young people 
unique experience in the management and sales techniques of the 
capitalist west 
dont ask the customer if he or she wants a large or a small 
drink a youthful soviet crew chief tells his trainees say 
large to encourage greater spending he explains 
everyone learns every job in the store something that would 
boggle the mind of the aeroflot cashier who is incapable of quoting 
a price on a flight because her only job is accepting money 
if i want to take a screwdriver from the storeroom i dont 
need six papers and five signatures marveled dairy manager 
alexander omenchenko 
it is people like omenchenko who will make or break mcdonalds 
this is a country in which the greatest consideration in taking a 
job is often not the salary but the opportunity for theft and 
bribetaking 
yet cohon and his staff say they have managed to find the best 
after an ad in a moscow newspaper swamped the local post office 
with 25000 applications for the 630 jobs 
still purchasing manager vladimir boras a veteran of 
mcdonalds first venture into the communist world in yugoslavia 
predicts that 240 of the young people will quit within a month in 
the face of the capitalist concept of hard work and the flood of 
hungry customers 
despite the 12hour days omenchenko is putting in just prior to 
opening hes glad he made the switch from his old job in a 
scientific institute 
i want to see modern technology he said and i want to 
show myself i want to see what i can do

the hopes of herbert and jutta 
schreiber soared when the berlin wall opened but after a couple of 
months they left east germany rather than wait for a good life 
that might never come 
the government talks about everything but nothing has really 
changed mrs schreiber 46 said of her homeland 
they are among the 850 new arrivals temporarily housed in 
emergency quarters aboard seven rhine river tour ships at 
duesseldorf 
since jan 1 more than 33000 east germans as many as 2000 a 
day have demonstrated what they think of prospects for significant 
improvements in their homeland they left 
some west german politicians fear the yearend tally could reach 
1 million 
those are figures that once caused the berlin wall to be 
built a west german magazine quoted interior minister wolfgang 
schaeuble as saying 
west germany is helping rebuild east germanys economy not only 
in hopes closer ties will lead to eventual german unification but 
in a bid to give east germans good reasons to stay at home 
the east germans know they have some leverage a week ago about 
60000 suitcasecarrying east germans marched into west germany in 
a symbolic exodus staged to show their dismay with conditions at 
home 
they stayed in the west just a short time but carried posters 
warning the next time it will be for real 
the unending stream of east germans is raising concern about how 
long east germany can withstand the drain and how long west 
germany can withstand the enormous burden on its social services 
and housing market 
more than 340000 east germans moved to west germany last year 
east germanys communist party made a bold gamble nov 9 when 
it opened its borders to show that a more democratic state was in 
the making the flow of skilled workers to the west slowed then 
but the departures have picked up in recent weeks as the communist 
government hangs on to power and bleak living standards persist 
resettlers give a litany of reasons for leaving total mistrust 
of the communist partys promises for real political change 
frustration over the lack of a unified opposition doubts that 
economic conditions will ever be seriously improved or a 
conviction that the only hope for resuing their homeland is 
reunification 
i had hopes that things would really change said 
22yearold torsten herz a east german resettler aboard one of the 
tour ships but the changes arent occurring fast enough 
herbert schreiber a 42yearold laborer complained about low 
salaries and a severe shortage of consumer goods in east germany 
consumer goods are exhorbitantly priced and the ones 
available are junk its been this way for years and i dont see 
any changes he said 
west germany has a serious housing shortage and east german 
resettlers can expect a wait of up to three years in temporary 
quarters before they move into permanent lodgings 
but west germanys prosperous economy offers them greater 
prospects than in east germany and while theyre adjusting to 
their new surroundings the resettlers are cradled by bonns social 
welfare net 
east germans resettlers are automatically given 200 marks 118 
in bridgingover money when they arrive in west germany 
they also are eligible for the same state pensions as west 
germans 
in addition an unemployed resettler can collect integration 
money of 647 a month for one year according to the west german 
interior ministry 
that may not sound like much but its higher than the average 
monthly east german salary of about 530 and compares to an 
average monthly salary of 1882 in west germany 
many west germans still resent the expenditure of their 
hardearned tax money on those flooding in from the east 
according to an opinion poll released jan 22 by west german 
television 52 percent of those questioned think the state funds 
should be scaled back 
with federal elections slated for december west german 
politicians themselves are starting to talk about trimming benefits 
for east germans and ethnic german emigres from eastern europe 
west german officials fear there could be an even greater surge 
of resettlers if east germanys may 6 elections should put the 
communists back in power 
there must be a lot of people waiting with packed suitcases to 
see if there will be positive signals on may 6 said hansjoachim 
muehlhaus a duesseldorfbased official for the german red cross

since jan 20 when troops and police officers fanned out in the 
northern valley to counter militants demanding secession of 
predominantly moslem kashmir from mostly hindu india

fomenting the trouble and appealed to the united states and several 
other countries to ensure the situation does not get out of hand 
pakistan has denied fueling the secessionist movement

anonymity 
the last break in the roundtheclock curfew was thursday the 
curfew was abruptly imposed again after police said moslem 
militants killed four air force officers on the outskirts of the 
city

tegucigalpa honduras vice president dan quayle began his 
fencemending trip to latin america today by assuring leaders that 
the last of the us forces who invaded panama will leave that 
country within weeks 
quayles first stop was the honduran capital where he had 
breakfast with salvadoran president alfredo cristiani both leaders 
were in honduras to attend the inauguration of rafael callejas the 
nationalist party leader who won last novembers presidential 
election 
details of the meeting with cristiani were not immediately 
known but it had been expected that the two would talk about 
economic policy human rights in el salvador and progress on the 
investigation into the slaying of six jesuit priests cristianis 
government has arrested and charged a group of military officers in 
the case 
in this case he is doing the right thing quayle said we 
are encouraged by the progress he is making 
quayle also praised cristiani for recognizing guillermo endara 
the panamanian president installed after the us invasion of 
panama on dec 20 
quayle said friday he expected to listen to objections from the 
latins especially president carlos andres perez of venezuela who 
are upset that much of the us force remains from the invasion 
the vice president also scheduled private meetings today with 
leaders of guatemala belize venezuela and costa rica who were at 
the inauguration 
quayle said he hoped for a positive reception from the latin 
leaders but conceded the bitter taste left by the invasion but 
quayle said en route that he believes he can assure them the troops 
will soon be gone 
he predicted it will be a matter of weeks rather than months 
before the troop strength is back to the normal 12000 from the 
high of 26000 that were there for the invasion 
i hope the reception is a good one quayle told reporters 
before leaving friday my message will be one of friendship 
consultation where do we go from here how do we build democracy 
in panama how do we build democracy in our western hemisphere 
tonight quayle flies on to panama where he will meet sunday 
with endara and will watch the super bowl on tv with us forces 
quayle will discuss with endara the details of bushs new 1 
billion aid package to help panama recover from invasion damage 
bush announced the package thursday and on friday he took 
another step to help boost panamas economy which was devastated 
by economic sanctions against the regime of gen manuel antonio 
noriega and by government corruption 
bush told congress friday that panama is now cooperating in 
international antidrug efforts and requested a resolution enabling 
panama to receive benefits withheld as part of the us economic 
sanctions aimed at toppling noriega 
the administration moved the drug certification up from its 
scheduled review in march as part of its effort to bolster the 
endara government 
governments that are deemed uncooperative on the drug front 
cannot receive certain us preferential benefits 
in his letter to congress bush said panama is fully 
cooperating with us on the war on drugs in addressing the urgent 
issues connected with rebuilding virtually every aspect of 
panamanian society since coming into office the government of 
president guillermo endara has made the war against drugs a 
centerpiece of its program 
bush has said he wants quayles talks to help soothe the anger 
that remains over the panama invasion widely viewed in the region 
as a violation of panamas sovereignty in addition the latin 
countries objected when us troops surrounded the vatican embassy 
where noriega initially took refuge and disapproved of the 
intrusion into the home of the nicaraguan ambassador

the countrys top shiite moslem cleric 
escaped an assassination attempt saturday when a car packed with 
explosives struck a pile of sand and blew up just before reaching 
his home police said 
sheik mohammed mehdi shamseddin was at home but unhurt when the 
red renault12 sedan carrying 55 pounds of explosives blew up about 
150 yards from his thirdfloor apartment a police statement said 
before the blast a man jumped out of the car and fled as the 
vehicle rolled into an alley toward shamseddins 10story apartment 
building the statement said 
the car drifted to the left hit a sand rampart roadblock and 
exploded causing no casualties the police statement said 
shamseddin 55 is vice chairman of the higher shiite islamic 
council the supreme religious body that handles the daytoday 
spiritual affairs of the 12 million shiites who make up lebanons 
largest sect 
shamseddin took over after the councils chairman imam moussa 
sadr mysteriously disappeared during a visit to libya in september 
1978 
police said several parked cars and windows were damaged by the 
blast 
there was no claim of responsibility nine car bombs exploded in 
lebanon in 1989 killing 80 people and wounding 342 by police 
count 
moslem security sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they believe the attack was part of a shiite power struggle 
pitting the proiranian hezbollah militia against the syrianbacked 
amal 
shamseddin a moderate supports amal chieftain nabih berri who 
also is minister of water and hydraulic resources in the government 
berri is at odds with former iranian interior minister ali akbar 
mohtashemi the hardliner who founded hezbollah when he was 
ambassador in damascus in the early 1980s 
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani dismissed mohtashemi as 
interior minister in august but mohtashemi later won election to 
parliament 
the hardline leader surfaced in lebanon late last year and held 
talks with officials of hezbollah which is believed to be the 
umbrella group for shiite factions holding most of the 18 western 
hostages in lebanon 
a police spokesman who cannot be named in line with 
regulations said amal and hezbollah fighters traded gunfire in 
south lebanons iqlim altuffah district saturday but there were 
no casualties 
by police count 98 people have been killed and 286 wounded 
since the latest amalhezbollah clashes broke out dec 23 
the explosion came a few days after president elias hrawis 
government said it had worked out a security plan for west beirut 
calling for the withdrawal of militias 
the plan was agreed upon during talks between hrawi and syrian 
president hafez assad in damascus 
in a news conference with assad on tuesday hrawi said the plan 
would make beirut an oasis of peace 
hrawi leads a christianmoslem government that is backed by 
syria which has the largest military presence in lebanon 
christian gen michel aoun whose forces control lebanons 
christian enclave refuses to recognize the government and has 
vowed to drive the syrians from lebanon 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said the plan 
calls for troops loyal to the government to replace syrians in most 
of the capitals western sector which is moslem 
but both lebanese and syrian soldiers will not be deployed in 
the heart of south beiruts slums where most of the western 
captives including eight americans are believed held the source

dug into trenches and trading cannon 
bombardments with the enemy guerrillas unaccustomed to 
conventional warfare claim they are holding firm against an 
offensive by government forces 
more accustomed to hitandrun tactics during a 15year war 
rebels of the national union for the total independence of angola 
are battling to protect the administrative and farming center of 
mavinga which they captured in 1981 
during the week sovietmade jets dropped bombs near villages 
and in cornfields around the district which is home to 20000 
people 
mavinga is about 135 miles northwest of jamba headquarters of 
the guerrilla group known by its portuguese abbreviation unita 
the guerrillas have been fighting for a share of power since 
marxists took control of the government following independence from 
portugal in 1975 
unita officers say the government launched the offensive last 
month to embarrass guerrilla leader jonas savimbi on his first 
visit to portugal since independence portuguese officials have 
agreed to meet savimbi although they recognize the angolan 
government 
they wanted to sabotage the trip of our president to say 
youre in portugal but were in mavinga said gen arlindo 
pena benben unitas military chief of staff 
savimbi postponed his trip originally set for jan 12 to lead 
12000 guerrillas against the offensive at least 9000 government 
troops accompanied by tanks had driven through 75 miles of 
guerrillaheld territory 
at that time we were not in control of the situation now we 
are said benben 
he said the forces of the government known as the popular 
movement for the liberation of angola were running low on 
supplies harassed by guerrillas attacking the convoys and unable 
to make accurate bombing runs because of the danger of guerrilla 
antiaircraft missiles supplied by the united states 
the jets make up to six flights across the river each day at 
altitudes of 20000 feet dropping two bombs at a time 
craters from phosphorous and shrapnel bombs within a few hundred 
yards of villages indicate the targets of recent bombing runs 
a woman who was seven months pregnant lost her baby and suffered 
severe cuts when a phosphorous bomb landed outside her house and 
several women were hurt by shrapnel when a bomb landed in a 
cornfield said lt col cristiano sussula 
they were aiming at the villages but flew away because of our 
antiaircraft defense they had to drop the bombs abruptly said 
sussula 
the guerrillas say the planes also drop chemical bombs which 
send up a grayishgreen smoke villagers attracted to the smoke on 
jan 17 collapsed coughing vomiting and losing control of their 
bowels when they approached said doctors at mavinga 
three died in two days and others were transferred to jamba for 
more sophisticated treatment doctors said 
journalists taken to a site near mavinga saw a circle of dead 
bushes with leaves turned yellow on the stem a week after the 
bombing a strong metallic taste lingered in the mouths of those 
who went close enough to inhale the air around the site 
the pounding from multiplefiring cannons the thuds of mortar 
shells and the rumble of tanks reverberate day and night through 
the bush 
rainyseason offensives are rare in angola benben said the 
government launched this one in desperation seeking a position of 
strength because it is under pressure from other african countries 
to negotiate a settlement 
savimbi and angolan president eduardo dos santos agreed to a 
truce in june but it collapsed within weeks 
as of jan 10 the guerrillas say they had 46 dead and 149 
wounded and had killed 207 government soldiers wounded 175 and 
injured four soviet advisers there are no firm figures on civilian 
casualties but unita reported at least 17 deaths and dozens of 
injuries from bombs 
benben said cubans are also participating in the battle in 
small numbers but he cant prove it unless he captures one a 
cuban presence in southern angola would violate a december 1988 
agreement with south africa that calls for all foreign troops to 
withdraw from angola and for south africa to grant independence to 
neighboring namibia 
last week cuba suspended the withdrawal of its remaining 19000 
troops out of anger over a guerilla attack that killed four of 
them unita said it did not know cubans would be stationed at the 
water purification plant that was attacked 
unita was not a party to the 1988 accord but savimbi said last 
year his soldiers wouldnt attack retreating cubans only those who 
continued fighting

fresh from a narrow victory in his first fight 
with congress this year president bush returns to capitol hill 
this week to lay out his policy agenda in an atmosphere that points 
to more skirmishing ahead 
the president won in a showdown with the democratcontrolled 
senate on thursday over his policy toward china but he had just 
three votes to spare as he prevented the twothirds majority needed 
to override his veto of legislation shielding chinese students in 
the united states from deportation 
following that display of political muscle bush will send his 
budget proposals to congress on monday then take the podium in the 
house chamber on wednesday night to deliver his first state of the 
union address 
the 12 trillion budget continues bushs nonewtaxes pledge 
trims pentagon spending by about 2 percent after inflation and 
boosts spending on foreign aid education drug programs and the 
environment 
bushs victory on the china bill came a day after the house 
overwhelmingly rejected the veto on a vote of 390 to 25 taken 
together the votes represent less than an overwhelming endorsement 
of bushs policy and came at considerable political expense to the 
president as well as senators who supported him 
we knew this was going to be a tough vote from the time we 
asked for it said janet mullins chief state department 
operative on capitol hill 
the china issue returns to the senate floor briefly this week 
when the chamber takes up a bill authorizing activities of the 
state department it includes a series of trade sanctions aimed at 
beijing 
the measure is expected to pass easily and the administration 
will not oppose it because the sanctions can be waived if bush 
determines doing so is in the national interest 
republicans believe bushs victory last week stunned democrats 
even if only briefly and will dissuade those looking for political 
opportunties to embarrass bush at least in the near term bush 
himself said the win would be helpful in reaching accommodation 
with the senate and house on other matters 
but the president was able to win only after several days of 
intense lobbying that included personal appeals and entreaties to 
party solidarity much of the debate in the senate focused not on 
the merits of the legislation but on whether congress was 
wrongfully trying to wrest away bushs foreignpolicy role 
it is an election year as well and congress will be looking 
impatiently for the payoff from bushs lowkey efforts to coax 
chinas government into moderation 
without a major new gesture or concession from beijing two 
enduring television images will remain in lawmakers minds 
lawmakers believe 
one is the student standing in front of a line of four tanks in 
tiananmen square before the june 4 crackdown and national security 
adviser brent scowcroft toasting the leaders who sent in the tanks 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan said last weeks 
skirmish amounted to the opening day of the 1990 election 
season and surmised that the vote to uphold the bush veto will be 
used against republicans in 30second democratic political spots 
come campaign time 
on his overall agenda before congress bush will be hoping to 
fare better than he did last year when he recorded unusually low 
overall support scores in congress for a honeymooning firstyear 
president 
a suvery by the journal congressional quarterly found that bush 
got his way just 63 percent of the time in 1989 the secondlowest 
firstyear success rate since the publication began compiling 
statistics in 1953 only president ford was lower with a 58 
percent rate in the watergate year of 1974

soft money the kind that seeps through 
the limits in federal election campaign laws flourished as never 
before in the 1988 presidential race a new survey shows 
and the results support claims by critics that many wealthy 
donors contributed the money with an eye to helping the 
presidential candidates of their choice thus getting around 
restrictions imposed by federal law 
federal law limits the size of individual contributions made to 
candidates but puts no restriction on the size of soft 
donations designed to help state party organizations register 
voters and similar activities 
the center for responsive politics sent its questionnaires to 
donors of soft money identified by the parties only 19 responded 
a small fraction 
eleven said their primary aim was support of presidential 
candidates 
contributors were promised confidentiality in the survey last 
year and its results have not previously been released 
the center a private bipartisan group that wants soft money 
contributions brought under federal control made copies of the 
questionnaires available to the associated press after deleting the 
donors names 
soft money may not legally be used in campaigns for federal 
office critics however say it was widely used by both parties in 
1988 to evade the contribution limits and pump large amounts into 
key presidential states 
figures on exactly how much soft money was contributed are not 
available the center basing its figures on public disclosures by 
the two national parties has used a total of 45 million 
but that was brought into question by its own survey of reports 
filed under state disclosure laws in nine presidential battleground 
states which counted money received by state parties through their 
national committees and in direct donations that survey showed 
285 million in those states alone 
the democratic national committee said it received 116 million 
in soft money in the three months before the election and disbursed 
157 million 
one donor who gave 100000 to the democratic national 
committee told the center he was asked to contribute by dukakis or 
his fundraisers and intended his money to be used to support the 
national democratic ticket 
he said he had no intention of contributing to other activities 
such as voter registration or getoutthevote drives others 
donors of between 35000 and 100000 excluded from federal 
limits gave similar answers 
eight of those responding said they did want their contributions 
to be used for such activities 
thirteen of the donors said public disclosure of soft 
contributions should be required by law several also said they 
should be prohibited or restricted 
fifteen gave to the democratic party and four to the republican 
party 
fundraisers for both parties defend their role in soliciting 
soft money during the presidential campaign season 
i refuse to apologize for trying to create a level playing 
field in 1988 for the first time with the republicans said 
robert farmer treasurer of the democratic national committee he 
said republicans outspent democrats heavily in the 1984 campaign 
through use of soft money 
i do not kid myself farmer said in an interview the 
reason such a flood of money comes in is because of the 
highprofile nature of a presidential campaign but i think the use 
of the money is very clear the fact of the matter is the money is 
used for party building activities 
farmer said party fundraisers working for dukakis told him in 
the heat of the campaign that we really need help in a key state 
or two and if you are talking to anybody important and can 
encourage them to give directly to that state that would be 
helpful 
i know that some people were encouraged to give directly to 
state parties at the end farmer said 
former republican national chairman frank fahrenkopf said the 
democrats never had done it before 1988 the reason they did it was 
pretty clearly that they wanted to impact the presidential race we 
had done it every year it has an incidental benefit to the 
presidential campaign even though it is not designed that way 
anyone who followed what i did knows that my entire focus was 
to build the local parties fahrenkopf said but you are never 
going to convince the people who believe it that every nickel of 
soft money isnt just a circuitous way to aid the presidential 
campaign 
congress is considering campaign reform legislation as part of 
the agenda for its forthcoming session 
i think the house and senate are going to pass campaign 
finance bills and i think as part of them we are going to deal with 
soft money said fred wertheimer president of common cause the 
selfstyled citizens lobby that advocates federal controls 
ellen s miller director of the center for responsive politics 
said she did not think the political signs are as optimistic as 
common cause thinks members are so relucant to change a system 
that benefits them in so many ways 
the federal election commission will meet jan 24 to consider 
new rules for allocating funds between state and national party 
committees in presidential election years common cause seeks to 
have the fec tighten its regulations and the agency was ordered by 
a federal judge last year to speed up action on the matter 
a group of grass roots political activists many of them 
veterans of the nuclear freeze movement are also getting into the 
act the study group on electoral democracy based in deerfield 
mass will hold a conference feb 24 in waveland miss to 
explore ways of generating public interest in campaign reform 
randy kehler former national coordinator for the nuclear freeze 
proponents said the question is can this issue which tends to 
be complex boring removed from everyday life for most people be 
made into an issue that a significant number of the american people 
can care about

the cleanup from a devastating storm that killed 
95 people in europe has barely begun but weather forecasting has 
already become a political issue in britain 
opposition politicians accuse the government of failing to give 
enough publicity to forecasts of thursdays storm which caused 46 
deaths and an estimated 16 billion damage in britain 
official reports said another 19 people died in holland 10 in 
belgium eight in france seven in west germany four in denmark 
and one in east germany 
the storm with winds up to 110 mph knocked out power and 
communications in large areas of britain and the continent 
severely disrupted transportation and uprooted millions of trees 
if we see the kind of hurricane warnings that occur off the 
coast of the united states the way that people are alerted the 
way that dangerous structures are shored up the way that people 
are warned in terms of transport or getting people off early we 
can see a very big difference indeed david blunkett a lawmaker 
from the opposition labor party said in an interview carried 
saturday by bbc radio 
on friday night a group of labor parliamentarians submitted a 
motion in the house of commons condemning the governments response 
to the storm 
when a storm of that magnitude threatens all or major parts of 
the country the government has a duty to ensure that full and 
frequent warnings are carried on tv and radio it is deplorable 
that the government completely failed to do this the motion said 
unlike the detailed weather forecasts featured on us 
television british tv seldom devotes more than a minute to a 
climate that generally drones along between warm and cool and 
usually wet 
roger hunt of the meteorological office said the storm was 
accurately forecast but the problem was getting people to pay 
attention 
we would like to get to the position where at least the public 
didnt travel as much as they might otherwise have done if we issue 
a warning to the effect that we expect driving conditions to be 
extremely hazardous said hunt 
that he said may take a good few years of education 
speaking in the house of commons on friday local government 
minister david hunt insisted that the government responded 
swiftly and immediately 
i understand all affected police forces issued through the 
media warnings about the dangers of travel he said 
the storm moved across the baltic on friday and into the soviet 
republics of lithuania and latvia where it tapered off 
forecasters said another severe storm was expected to hit 
ireland and britain on monday but winds were not expected to 
exceed 60 mph 
as the cleanup continued saturday bbc tv said 200000 customers 
were still without electricity the forestry commission estimated 
that 3 million trees were down 
french coast guard aircraft resumed a search off the brittany 
coast for the five crew members of the trawler la fayette which 
sent a distress signal thursday and has not been seen since then 
belgian insurance companies estimated saturday that damage from 
the storm will exceed 79 million in their country 
insurers in denmark estimated that damage there would total 
192 million 
east germanys one fatality was in the southern city of 
karlmarxstadt where a man was fatally injured when his motor 
scooter hit a tree uprooted by the storm

the amateur bowlers tour unlawfully 
discriminated against a chippewa indian by barring him from a 
tournament because of his long hair worn in a pony tail a judge 
has ruled 
ramsey county district judge roland faricy on friday ruled in 
favor of joe big bear of st paul and turned down the tours appeal 
of a decision by the st paul human rights commission 
in september the commission said the tour discriminated against 
big bear on the basis of sex and awarded him 3000 in damages the 
commission also ordered the tour to pay 1300 in costs incurred by 
the city in investigating and prosecuting big bears complaint 
big bear ran afoul of a rule that male bowlers cannot have hair 
below the bottom of the normal collar and cannot wear braids 
ponytails hair curlers head bands or hats the commission noted 
that there were no rules governing the length of the hair of female 
entrants 
the tours attorneys contended that it is not a public 
accommodation in which the law forbids discrimination because 
it is selective in admitting members faricy rejected the argument 
noting that the competition excludes only very highscoring bowlers 
from amateur status 
with the support of its cosponsor bud light beer the tour has 
paid more than 40 million in prizes to bowlers since 1977 
questioning the tours argument that its grooming standards are 
necessary to attract sponsors faricy cited a bud light commercial 
in which two men are captured by an army of scantily clad amazons 
they discover they cannot leave but are told they will get an 
unlimited supply of bud light 
if that level of bad taste sexism and excess is acceptable to 
bud light he wrote perhaps the amateur bowlers tour does not 
need to worry about establishing very high standards for its 
members

reinforced concrete slabs from the berlin 
wall should be used for building silos and dung storage containers 
the east german farmers party said saturday 
prized wall graffiti would not have to vanish if the concrete 
were put to such use the democratic peasant partys official 
newspaper said 
valuable paintings would certainly face outward and would thus 
be maintained for future generations the paper said why 
shouldnt villages also have such a tourist attraction 
since communist authorities opened the wall nov 9 after 28 
years east german officials have said the border barrier will be 
dismantled and sold by the slab to foreigners paying hard currency 
east german border guards removed a first 320yard stretch of 
the 100mile wall in west berlin last week and carted the pieces 
off to a depot 
the farmers party is one of several small parties that was 
aligned with the communists during their 40year hold on power 
before the fall prodemocracy revolution 
despite the dismantled walls suitability to agrarian uses 
farmers are not likely to be able to compete with cashbearing 
westerners who have been paying as much as 29000 for slabs from 
the infamous cold war symbol

bissau guineabissau ap pope john paul ii on saturday urged 
rejection of ideologies and respect for human rights as he came to 
this poor marxistoriented country on his african pilgrimage 
the pontiff said the church realized the difficulties of trying 
to find the best political system to improve living conditions in 
guineabissau one of the worlds 15 poorest countries 
the average life expectency in this former portuguese colony on 
the west african coast is 39 the lowest in the world and annual 
per capita income is around 190 
in an airport speech after his arrival on the second leg of his 
eightday tour of the sahel region the pope said the pillars of 
a truly human model of society should be freedom justice and 
fundamental rights 
the pope criticized education based on ideology vatican 
officials said this was in reference to complaints by the local 
church that the oneparty state imposes marxistoriented teaching 
in schools 
john paul said education should be global cautioning 
against teaching that turns students into objects and leads them to 
uncontrolled productionism guided only by national interests 
in such cases you run the risk of evasion and the search for 
escape perhaps in violence with all its evils he said 
speaking in portuguese 
i pray that the education process here has complete success 
starting with a real literacy campaign 
the pope arrived in bissau in sunshine and sweltering heat a 
striking contrast with the rain and wind that marked his two days 
in the barren cape verde islands 
the pope later addressed clergy in the bissau cathedral and 
celebrated mass at the sept 24 stadium named after the date in 
1973 when the country gained independence 
in his homily during the mass john paul made another reference 
to marxist ideology saying people should be spared from 
everything which seeks to crush or eliminate them in the 
anonymity of collectivity 
he said the local church promotes the fundamental rights of 
man and rejection of static and conditioning ideologies 
be vigilant and dont let yourselves be won over by the 
temptations of corruption and abuse of power and wealth he told 
the faithful 
touching on a common theme of his papacy john paul warned 
against materialism consumerism and forms of development that 
favor a mere expansion of technologies for economic growth 
despite the churchstate dispute over education the government 
of president joao bernado vieira who took power in a 1980 coup 
has sought to shed some of its marxist practices 
it has liberalized the economy lifting price controls and trade 
restrictions at the behest of the world bank and international 
monetary fund 
in its latest report the human rights organization amnesty 
international accused the government of holding about 30 political 
prisoners in connection with an alleged 1985 plot to overthrow 
vieira the report said they had received an unfair trial 
in what was seen as a gesture to the pope the government last 
week freed 16 people who were convicted in the alleged conspiracy 
six others convicted in the same case were executed in july

joe poole stood in the rain outside the 
downtown woolworth store and recalled what it was like in 1960 for 
a black man to try to get a meal at some lunch counters in the 
south 
there was a time when they wouldnt wait on you said poole 
who is 85 weve come a long way but it wont be perfect until 
we get to heaven 
thursday will be the 30th anniversary of sitins which began 
when four freshmen from thenallblack north carolina agricultural 
and technical college sat at the woolworth stores whitesonly 
lunch counter and asked for service 
their refusal to leave when they were denied service sparked 
similar sitins at other segregated lunch counters and helped 
established passive resistance as a tool of the 1960s civil rights 
movement 
the state since has erected a historical marker at the site and 
on wednesday greensboro begins five days of activities 
commemorating the anniversary with a panel discussion at the 
university of north carolinagreensboro 
not only was the south in for a time of change more 
important the terms of that change would no longer be dictated by 
white southerners wrote william h chafe a duke university 
historian in his 1980 book civilities and civil rights 
when the four students david richmond franklin mccain ezell 
blair jr and joseph mcneil planned the sitin greensboro was a 
segregated city 
public buildings had separate water fountains for whites and 
blacks theaters had separate entrances for blacks who were forced 
to sit in balconies blacks also were required to step to the rear 
on city buses 
the first sitin will be reenacted at 730 am thursday a 
plaque and footprints will be dedicated in front of the store and a 
sculpture will be unveiled at north carolina aampt state university 
all four demonstrators are expected to attend the celebration 
which will include symposiums an awards banquet a performance of 
alice walkers down a lonesome road and a jazz concert 
featuring dizzy gillespie 
before going to woolworth on feb 1 1960 the four students 
agreed they would be courteous and would not miss any classes they 
also agreed it would be a nonviolent demonstration 
they targeted woolworth because it was a national chain that 
allowed its lunch counters to be segregated only in the south 
we fully talked about the prospect of going to jail mccain 
said in an interview five years ago in fact we didnt think 
wed come back to campus 
they were allowed to go back to school and news about the 
sitin flashed across campus the next day more than two dozen 
male and female students showed up at the lunch counter they too 
were denied service 
on the third day the demonstrations spread to the kress 
fiveanddime store down the street the sitins quickly became 
national news 
gov luther hodges called the sitins counterproductive and 
a threat to law and order soon crowds began gathering to watch 
the students hecklers including ku klux klansmen taunted the 
students 
the sitins quickly spread to other north carolina cities 
one week to the day after the demonstrations had started in 
greensboro black students in winstonsalem and durham held sitins 
at local lunch counters chafe wrote the next day 
demonstrations began in charlotte and the day after that in 
raleigh by the end of the week students were sittingin across the 
state 
restaurant owners resisted efforts to persuade them to change 
their policy saying they feared integration would drive away white 
customers 
on july 25 1960 nearly six months after the first sitin 
woolworth agreed to allow blacks at the lunch counter later 
accounts reported the chain lost about 200000 in business during 
the sitins 
today the lunch counter looks about the same as it did in the 
30yearold news photographs but black and white customers sit 
side by side on red vinyl seats eating and talking about sports 
and events of the day 
its the way it should be said one white customer mary lou

an 11yearold girl who recanted 
testimony that she was raped by her mothers boyfriend had 
fabricated her story after watching a television police drama 
lawyers said 
her testimony given when she was 9 helped convict ivie cornell 
norris who spent 513 days in pinellas county jail and could have 
faced life behind bars the girl recanted friday and norris is a 
free man 
he didnt do it she told circuit judge raymond ulmer jr 
her voice barely audible her eyes downcast prosecutors then asked 
that the case be thrown out 
i thank the lord this kid came up and told the truth a 
tearyeyed norris 55 said as he left court 
i cant understand it the childs mother said she 
convinced me she convinced a jury she convinced my parents she 
went through the whole bit 
attorneys in the case said the girl based her testimony on an 
episode of the television drama 21 jump street that depicted a 
rape case 
her mother told the judge that the girl admitted a couple of 
months ago she had fabricated the story with the idea of getting 
norris out of the way because the couple fought and she just 
wanted him away from me 
mary c orendorf a juror at norris trial recalled friday how 
the girls credibility was the central issue during four hours of 
deliberations at the trial in 1988 there was no physical evidence 
she said only the girls word 
we really went over it and over it to see is she making this 
up is she telling the truth ms orendorf said 
on the stand the girl appeared calm even a little timid she 
recalled it just didnt seem like she was lying 
investigators with the state department of health and 
rehabilitative services were asked to assess the girls claims 
shortly after she reported the attack they too believed her but 
noted there was no medical confirmation 
according to the trial testimony the alleged attack took place 
in march 1988 soon after the girls mother entered the hospital for 
a threeweek treatment for cocaine addiction and left the girl with 
norris 
norris was found guilty nov 9 1988 but won a new trial on the 
grounds that his attorneys should be allowed to crossexamine the 
girl about her claim of molestation by another of her mothers 
boyfriends 
the second trial was set to begin earlier this month thats 
when the childs mother first told prosecutors for the first time 
that her daughter had recanted the rape story 
some jurors said the fact norris didnt take the stand in his 
own defense an option guaranteed defendants under the 
constitution worked against him assistant public defender scott 
schiltz said keeping norris off the stand was a tactical move he 
now regrets 
when you get a defendant on the stand you just dont know what 
theyre going to say the attorney said 
norris said his time behind bars cost him his job friends and 
time with his son i lost everything he said 
he said he bears no anger toward the girl only saying shes 
a good liar always was

rocky balboa filmdoms most famous boxer 
ran up the great stone steps of the philadelphia art museum on 
saturday for what may be the last time 
i think this is the final chapter my legs are going joked 
actor sylvester stallone during a break in filming rocky v 
stallone who was a nearunknown when he first played the boxer 
who rose from the slums of philadelphia to become world champion 
said his next challenge would be getting down the steps without 
falling hes 43 
stallone and his crew filmed what he called the turning 
point in his latest rocky film at dawn saturday the 
actorfilmmaker promises it will be an aweinspiring segment 
the original rocky winner of the 1976 academy award for 
best picture showed philadelphias cityscape to millions as boxer 
rocky balboa trained by running through the citys italian market 
and up the steps of the museum 
the city figured less prominently in three sequels and none of 
rocky iv was filmed here by contrast filming for rocky v 
began jan 10 and is expected to last about six weeks in 
philadelphia 
stallone said that while rocky represents a fantasy for 
everyone the role remains intensely personal for him 
its a time when i reflect on my life he said my life 
has been facing an uphill climb and when i get to the steps its a 
very humbling experience i mean i really did make it but its 
very easy to fall down again 
stallone and the city have ended an 8yearold dispute over a 
10foot bronze statue of rocky that he left atop the art museum 
steps in 1982 
the statue was returned earlier this month for the filming after 
museum officials got a written contract assuring them that the 
bronze would be returned to the spectrum the citys indoor sports 
arena 
the last time the statue stood in front of the museum officials 
spent 12000 to move it saying the statue wasnt art 
stallone has said little about the sequels script which he 
wrote 
rocky v with a 40 million budget is said to have 
heavyweight champion balboa retiring from the ring and running the 
gym where he once trained he takes under his wing an exconvict 
to be played by boxer tommy morrison 20 a greatgrandnephew of 
the late john wayne 
talia shire is back as rockys wife and burt young again 
portrays rockys brotherinlaw and john avildsen director of the 
original movie is back behind the megaphone

balloons wafted skyward and 
helicopters hovered overhead saturday as a colorful caravan of 
camels cars and a horsedrawn cart kicked off a middle east 
campaign against drugs 
saudis in the parking lot of the malaz sports stadium cheered as 
the caravan began its fiveday tour of the capital it is to 
continue on to 11 other saudi cities and then begin touring other 
arab countries in the region 
the riyadh vice governor prince sattam and us ambassador 
charles w freeman jr took part in the festivities 
the 600yard caravan is made up of five trucks 25 sedans an 
armored vehicle a horsedrawn cart carrying a marching band eight 
camels and police cars 
the stadium parking lot was filled with white tents containing 
visual displays books stickers and pamphlets on drug abuse the 
us information service helped provide antidrug leaflets for the 
helicopters to drop 
heliumfilled balloons brightly colored flags and streamers 
brightened the atmosphere helicopters circled overhead 
leaflets will be distributed to the public and theatrical 
events with drug abuse as the main them will be performed by 
saudi actors 
while saudi arabias drug problem is minor in comparison to most 
western countries the kingdom has responded swiftly to curtail 
drug imports three years ago king fahd issued a royal decree 
mandating the death penalty for drug smugglers 
since then 21 people have been publicly beheaded for drug 
offenses and according to the national commission for combating 
drugs drug abuse and trafficking have decreased by 50 percent 
the decision to execute drug smugglers has had a major 
impact said maj gen ibrahim almaiman acting director of the 
commission 
in interviews with local press almaiman has expressed hope 
that the caravan organized by his office will help educate saudi 
citizens about drugs 
parades festivals shows competitions and gifts will ensure 
bigger attendance to the caravan and will hence enable us to 
distribute more pamphlets and books against drugs said almaiman

iron bars parted and bishop austin vaughan 
walked out of the albany county jail last week to hugs applause 
and even an autograph seeker antiabortion crusaders had a new 
hero 
vaughan a 62yearold auxiliary bishop of the roman catholic 
new york archdiocese had served a 15day sentence for blocking the 
entrance of a planned parenthood office in a protest organized by 
operation rescue 
but what vaughan said while in jail attracted far more attention 
than what he did to get there 
the bishop said gov mario cuomo risked going to hell for his 
prochoice views vaughan described the new york democrat as a 
sunday catholic who has done more than anybody in the state to 
promote abortion and vaughan said hed be happy to see cuomo 
excommunicated from the church 
cuomo considered a potential 1992 democratic presidential 
candidate has said he accepts the churchs teaching on abortion in 
his personal life but that abortion is a matter of a womans own 
conscience he budgets about 15 million a year in state funds to 
pay for abortions for poor women he received warm ovations for a 
speech at a prochoice conference last week 
the governor who termed vaughans remarks intemperate said 
hell eventually be judged by a higher and wiser power 
vaughans colleagues havent rushed to his defense 
bishop francis mugavero head of the brooklyn diocese said 
vaughans statement that cuomo risks eternal damnation troubles 
me 
i do not think that we are in the position to judge the final 
punishment a person will receive because of that individuals 
actions in this life mugavero said we must leave that 
judgment in the hands of a merciful god 
bishop edward head of the buffalo diocese said he doesnt want 
to debate an individuals personal relationship with god in 
public but head said he cannot accept cuomos stand on abortion 
cardinal john oconnor vaughans boss said hed withhold 
comment until he spoke to the auxiliary bishop an oconnor 
spokesman said he didnt know when that would happen 
vaughan said he understands why other church leaders have been 
reluctant to make such public warnings but hes not backing down 
when he left jail wednesday morning five friends were there to 
applaud him one wore a silver pin of tiny babys feet on his 
lapel another asked vaughan to autograph a copy of the new york 
post frontpage with its headline jailed bishop to cuomo youre 
risking hell 
vaughan taught theology for nearly 20 years at st joseph 
seminary in yonkers and became a bishop in 1977 as an auxiliary 
bishop he serves as an assistant to oconnor and has been assigned 
as pastor of st patricks church in newburgh 
his activism he said began when he noticed none of the 
candidates in the 1988 new york democratic presidential primary 
were addressing the abortion issue 
he joined operation rescue and has since served separate 
twoday jail sentences for trespassing at abortion clinics in 
pennsylvania and westchester county with time off for good 
behavior he had to spend 10 days behind bars in albany 
vaughan is one of two catholic bishops who have been jailed for 
participation in operation rescue demonstrations said barbara 
duffy a spokeswoman for the organization 
vaughan said does not encourage his parishioners to risk arrest 
with operation rescue but he wants them to put justifiable 
pressure on public officials 
one of the states leading prochoice activists predicted the 
church would seek to dissociate itself from vaughans statements to 
head off a backlash similar to what happened last fall when san 
diegos bishop refused to give communion to a prochoice california 
state senate candidate she went on to win the election 
i bet theyre going to run for cover said shirley gordon 
executive director of the family planning advocates of new york 
state 
vaughan said its never been catholic custom to publicly warn 
politicians of their potential fate for espousing prochoice views 
by hindsight its a mistake he said but im not 
surprised if other bishops dont jump on the bandwagon and go along 
with that the fact that this is now an issue of public discussion 
the very circumstances are going to force bishops to face up to 
whether or not this is the direction they want to go in im not 
sure what theyre going to say on that

former secretary of state henry a kissinger 
says the united states will have to support reunification of the 
two germanies despite hopes to the contrary on the part of soviet 
leaders 
the secret dream of the soviet union is that we will prevent 
the unification of germany kissinger said in a interview taped 
for airing sunday on nbc televisions john mclaughlins one on 
one 
the germanborn kissiner said he personally would have been 
satisfied if the reunification issue had not come up in my 
lifetime 
but it has come up and it has come up in a way that makes it 
unavoidable and it makes it important for the united states to get 
behind it or else german nationalism is going to turn against the 
united states he said 
kissinger said visible major steps will be taken within two 
years toward german unification 
after upcoming elections east germany is likely to follow 
czechoslovakia hungary and poland in requesting withdrawal of 
soviet forces from its territory kissinger said 
he urged demilitarizing east germany and creating a nonaligned 
military status like that of austria for former satellite 
states 
he said east germany will come under intense pressure to raise 
its economic level to that of west germany or lose much of its 
population through the open border this will mean forming a 
common economic unit with west germany kissinger said 
kissinger predicted that a unified germany economically 
will tilt west while militarily the new situation will require 
complex arms talks 
i do not agree that you can demilitarize a whole country of 
the size and economic potential of the federal republic of all of 
germany of some 80 million people he said 
he said the most dangerous situation for both east and west 
would be to have a neutral germany unattached to anybody because 
that would restore european politics to what it was before the two 
world wars of a germany looking for its own security entirely to 
itself in the center of the european continent 
kissinger gave gorbachev at best a 5050 chance to survive 
the nationality and other crises threatening his rule the kremlin 
leaders greatest assets he said are that he has established an 
extraordinary position in the outside world and secondly the mess 
inside the soviet union is so great that no alternative leader 
wants to take over 
kissinger said in a tv interview earlier this month gorbachev 
might survive secession of the baltic states but not the loss of 
more central soviet republics now shaken by an upsurge of 
nationalism 
he said the kremlin currently is using more force than needed to 
quell clashes between armenians and azerbaijanis in the soviet 
unions southern republic of azerbaijan 
kissinger said the real motive for the massive soviet 
intervention is to keep azerbaijan in the soviet union to 
demonstrate that the center cannot be defied with impunity

trial begins tuesday in a unique race 
discrimination case with legal and social implications a black 
woman fired by the irs is suing her boss a darkerskinned black 
woman claiming discrimination because of color 
tracy lynn morrow would become the first black worker to collect 
damages from a black supervisor because of skinshade 
discrimination according to her attorney and federal equal 
opportunity officials 
us district judge charles moye ruled last spring that such 
light vs dark blackonblack discrimination is possible and that 
the issue should be decided in court 
ms morrow contends that she was targeted for harassment because 
of her skin tone her boss ruby lewis contends that ms morrow 
then tracy lynn walker was errorprone belligerent frequently 
late and dishonest 
ms morrow a former internal revenue service temporary employee 
in seattle was hired in atlanta as a clerktypist in 1985 she 
entered probation for a permanent position on dec 9 1985 but was 
fired on march 14 1986 
a race relations expert in atlanta charles king believes ms 
morrow will have a tough time proving discrimination because both 
sides acknowledge the position eventually was filled with another 
black woman 
the whole thing is lamentable that the courts would accept 
this as discrimination said king nationally known for his 
confrontational race relations seminars to me its interesting 
but logistically and logically theres no case 
ms morrows attorney stephen katz disagrees the judge he 
noted has already ascertained that ms morrow is a member of what 
is known in the law as a protected class now he said she 
must prove that she was improperly replaced by someone outside the 
protected class or show direct evidence of discrimination 
katz declined to discuss his evidence before trial but said he 
is confident he can prove discrimination the nonjury trial is 
expected to take about four days 
ms lewis and ms morrows earlier boss a white woman virginia 
fite gave depositions indicating ms morrow was repeatedly cited 
for tardiness and poor work 
ms fite said the employee showed an inability to write had 
a stubborn or immature attitude and prompted the personnel 
office to report she was driving them crazy complaining about 
things her work was just adequate ms fite said 
ms lewis contended that ms morrow became more demanding 
after she was made a permanent employee made increasing errors 
amid a further deterioration of attitude and conduct after a 
leave request was denied and finally lied about crucial mistakes 
she had made 
ms lewis said she has never been prejudiced on the grounds of 
race or color ms fite backed her up saying ms lewis was not 
someone who would discriminate for any reason and certainly not 
for race 
and ms lewis said she never regarded ms morrow as fairskinned 
anyway rather as medium brown the same as she is 
katz said ms morrow would prefer not to discuss the case before 
trial but he said he would show the unfavorable reviews of ms 
morrows job performance are not accurate 
ms morrow is seeking reinstatement and up to 60000 in back 
pay and other payments she has since found employment with a car 
rental agency but would prefer to resume her job in government 
katz said 
its good work if you can get it he said 
the judge in certifying the case for trial said there is 
evidence that ms lewis might have harbored resentful feelings 
towards white people and therefore by inference possibly towards 
lightskinned black people 
king said blackonblack discrimination has its basis in 
blacks adapting white institutional attitudes and behavior 
patterns its not that blacks are discriminating against blacks 
but they try to conform to white standards and procedures 
also there is a class struggle within the black race based 
upon complexion he said he said darker complexioned blacks may 
transmit hostility they have toward white people toward 
lightcomplexioned blacks who display conformity to white 
behavioral patterns

budget director richard g darman will liken 
the federal budget to a voracious cookie monster in a fanciful 
message to congress that also will warn lawmakers against expecting 
a peace dividend from reduced tensions in eastern europe 
the budget for all its intimidating detail might be seen 
as the ultimate cookie monster darman will assert in an 
introduction to bushs 12 trillion fiscal 1991 budget 
its excess tendencies toward consumption are not exactly 
ennobling but at the same time its underlying motivation is 
clearly not malevolent what harm it might cause is largely 
unintended darman writes 
darman in the introduction to be formally released with the 
budget on monday tells congress that the job of responsible public 
officials is to seek to get the cookie monster under control 
darman also will caution lawmakers against seeking a 
wonderland in which military savings can be diverted to 
domestic programs 
the nearterm peace dividend is likely to be smaller than 
commonly assumed darman says in his introduction 
some members of congress have proposed that the reductions in 
military tensions in eastern europe can be turned into a socalled 
peace dividend and spent on expanding social programs 
darman however tells congress it would be naively euphoric 
to expect that the crumbling of the soviet empire will spell a 
final end to eastwest tensions 
still bushs budget will propose an austere 2921 billion in 
pentagon spending for the fiscal year that begins next oct 1 
representing the lowest increase in more than a decade and an 
actual reduction of about 2 percent if inflation is taken into 
account according to administration sources 
excerpts from darmans introduction were first published in 
saturdays editions of the new york times and later confirmed by 
administration officials 
darman asserts that the great historical shift in eastern 
europe has been almost trivialized in its translation into public 
debate about the budget the issue has been framed as how big is 
the peace dividend and in effect how can i get mine 
he said the prime objective of the budget was not to find other 
ways of spending military savings but how can it best preserve 
and build on americas strengths 
darman asks in his partly whimsical introduction how big is 
the deficit and paraphrasing elizabeth barrett browning he 
answers the question let me count the ways 
darman also will tell congress that many programs in the budget 
are like the hungry monsters in pac man the popular video game 
waiting to spring forward and consume another line of resources 
dots in the budget maze 
but then he adds at some point it is appropriate to put 
games aside at least for a while at some point there is an 
obligation to be serious 
at some point partisan posturing must yield to the 
responsibility to govern 
darman also weighs in on the current controversy over social 
security funding 
bushs budget proposes no change in either benefits or taxes 
but would use surpluses in the system after the year 1993 when 
the annual budget is required to be balanced under the grammrudman 
law to help pay off the national debt 
by contrast a popular proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan 
dny would roll back the social security tax increase that took 
effect in january and reduce it further next year 
darman calls the moynihan plan a superficially attractive 
proposal 
but the budget director asserts that in reality cutting the 
social security tax at this time would either force the government 
to raise other taxes to offset the loss in revenues or lead to a 
reduction in benefits 
the presidents proposal is a responsible way to protect 
the future interests of todays workers darman says 
however he concedes social security is a notoriously 
volatile subject when it enters the political domain and whether 
rationality will prevail remains to be determined 
this years budget meets the responsibility to be serious 
darman says in his notcompletelyserious introduction this of 
course is not to assert that the budget will be treated seriously 
in the very next beatthebudget game it is simply to suggest 
that it should be

president bush is dealing with the reconvened 
democratic congress from a position some of his predecessors would 
have used to get votesor get even it doesnt seem to work that way 
for bush 
lyndon b johnson twisted congressional arms to gain support for 
his proposals and called it reasoning together ronald reagan said 
that if congress didnt see the light his way he would make them 
feel the heat 
their hardball lobbyists offered political rewards threatened 
punishments using the popularity of their presidents and warning 
that straying members might pay at the polls 
bush opens the 1990 campaign year with job approval ratings that 
surpass the firstyear standing of those predecessors and that 
havent been matched since john f kennedy but so far at least 
his personal popularity has not been convertible into lobbying 
clout in congress 
the president did use some oldfashioned lobbying to get his way 
in the first test of the year finding three votes more than he 
needed on thursday to sustain his veto of a bill to extend the 
visas of chinese students a step he said he already had taken with 
presidential powers 
hed been told he would lose on the veto even by the 
headcounting republican whips of both the house and the senate 
they were half right the house overrode 390 to 25 the senate 
failed to do so 62 to 37 
bush and his lobbying allies used party loyalty presidential 
prerogatives and the argument that the vetoed bill was redundant in 
the twoday drive that turned it around 
because the issue was a veto the president needed only a 
minority to keep the senate count below the twothirds it takes to 
override thats enough when the objective is to stop something 
from happening it takes majorities to change things or to start 
new ones 
bush has the poll numbers but he doesnt have the coattails 
reagan showed in his first presidential election reagan had 
grounds to claim a mandate for major change in government and he 
had a conservative movement behind it that gave his lieutenants a 
network that could apply pressure from home districts on wavering 
congressmen as the administration built its coalition of 
republicans and conservative democrats in the house 
reagan also had the most saleable of issues in his first year 
the income tax cut that had been a centerpiece of his campaign 
enacting it and pruning down the size and power of government were 
his mandate 
bush was elected to carry on to make it all work despite giant 
budget deficits left in part because taxes were indeed cut but 
government shrank little if at all under reagan 
bush has a leftover tax cut to push a capital gains reduction 
that is likely to be passed this year but he also is confronted 
with the risk of a runaway toward the social security tax cut 
proposed by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny 
his state of the union address on wednesday night is likely to 
restate familiar proposals and priorities rather than seek new 
ones and to be coupled with a renewed call for bipartisanship 
with neither the money nor the inclination to undertake major new 
programs at home bush is sure to emphasize successes abroad as he 
keynotes the electionyear congressional session 
seeking to head off the inevitable pressure for peace dividend 
cuts in the defense budget bush said in advance that he will soon 
present a new military plan of his own to restructure americas 
defenses in the wake of the dramatic changes that are taking place 
abroad 
the defense budget he will present on monday seeks an increase 
in pentagon spending but bush said it will begin the transition 
to a restructured military a new strategy that is more flexible 
more geared to contingencies outside of europe while continuing to 
meet our inescapable responsibility to nato and to maintaining the 
global balance 
bush also will ask congress to promote the environmental 
protection agency to cabinet rank that will be the 15th seat at 
the cabinet table 
overall it is a managers agenda not a script for dramatic 
change or a catalog of republican issues for the campaign year 
bush said going in that his agenda was not one of drastic change 
but of building on eight years of republican administration under 
reagan 
the major arena of change in 1989 was outside his reach 
although it certainly worked to his benefit the administration and 
congress could only react and respond to the largely peaceful 
revolution that undid communist dominance in eastern europe 
for a while democratic leaders criticized bush saying he was 
too timid and too passive but the issue didnt take 
republicans are trying to make eastern europe into a 1990 issue 
on their own terms contending their military and foreign policies 
created the conditions for change 
freedom and democracy are breaking out across this entire 
planet republican national chairman lee atwater told party 
leaders i guarantee you that would not be happening today if it 
were not for a decade of leadership by ronald reagan and george 
bush 
the guarantee is debatable but there is no question that bush 
has been buoyed by those changes and by public support for his 
intervention in panama 
for all of that there is no sign that his current popularity 
will enable the administration to move many votes or to build a 
reaganstyle coalition in congress 
that has more to do with the last election than with the latest 
polls in winning the white house bush saw his republican ticket 
lose strength in congress democrats gained three seats in the 
house one in the senate 
a winning presidential candidate usually leads his party to 
congressional gains but bush did not he ran weaker than 
congressional candidates in 389 of the 435 house districts 
offyear elections historically are difficult for the presidents 
party the white house party hasnt gained house seats in an off 
year since 1934

the white house is receiving a lot of phone 
calls urging president bush not to go to a drug summit in 
colombia but he has decided that any risks to his security are 
outweighed by other factors his chief of staff says 
he understands the pluses and minuses there are a lot of hard 
decisions in this and not every decision is all plus said 
john sununu 
colombia has been wracked by bombings shootings and kidnappings 
ever since president virgilio barco declared war on the countrys 
cocaine drug lords last year 
by some accounts drug barons have put out a 30 million 
assassination contract on bush and are trying to buy surfacetoair 
missiles to shoot down his plane when he travels to cartagena for 
an meeting feb 15 with barco and officials of bolivia and peru 
while reaffirming that bush will attend the summit sununu said 
the white house is taking extraordinary steps for his protection 
this is critical enough that whatever we decide in terms of 
logistics and timing we will probably keep as close to the vest 
until the very last minute he said in an interview friday with 
five reporters 
we have three or four alternatives that are reasonably 
comfortable alternatives and were trying to work with all the 
south american countries involved to make sure that everybody feels 
comfortable with the options were looking at he said 
well pick probably at the last minute one option he 
said 
for example sources say the travel arrangements are being 
reviewed rather than go into cartagena on air force one bush 
might fly somewhere else perhaps spend some time on an aircraft 
carrier and then take a helicopter to the summit 
sununu said all of the options involve going to colombia he 
said bush weighed the risks and determined the pluses outweigh 
the minuses we ought to be going to cartagena 
acknowledging apprehensions about bushs trip sununu said i 
told the president were getting a lot of phone calls and i 
communicated that to him 
another security issue being examined is where to put the press 
corps and white house press staff that traditionally accompany the 
president 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said last week the 
press operation probably would be based in another country such as 
costa rica venezuela or panama 
however a number of reporters and news organizations have 
objected to that idea and fitzwater now says the decision could go 
either way 
commenting on that topic sununu said frankly the hard part 
that we have to deal with is that we really dont have a 
structure for full protection of people beyond the president 
thats a real concern that we dont have a security structure 
that extends that far out in the circle of the onion layer he 
said and so we are looking for combinations that allow us to 
use the inherent security we have for the president and if you 
will the logistics and the geography to the best benefit of 
everybody else that is there

advocates of statehood for the nations 
capital plan to make sure their message will not be lost in the 
turmoil caused by mayor marion barrys cocaine possession arrest 
any tourists wishing to visit the vista hotel where barry 
allegedly smoked crack cocaine first will have to pass signs 
advising them that they are entering the nations last colony 
barrys arrest jan 18 on a federal charge of possessing cocaine 
has focused attention on his crumbling political fortunes and a 
possible mayoral candidacy by jesse jackson but it has also 
stirred a quieter debate over the impact on a longmoribund drive 
to make the city the 51st state 
clearly this sets that back rep stan parris rva a city 
critic said last week after barrys arrest there is not an 
organized crescendo against home rule he said there is an 
increased discussion about whether this thing is really working 
jackson has taken up the statehood cause regardless of whether 
it leads to a personal candidacy 
maryland was not disenfranchised when gov marvin mandel 
went to jail the twotime democratic presidential hopeful said 
last week there is no valid argument for denying statehood to 
the nearly 700000 people who live here 
residents of the district of columbia have no voting 
representatives in congress even though the city claims a larger 
population than either delaware north dakota vermont or wyoming 
the citys budget must be approved by congress and the house and 
senate have permanent committees to oversee the districts affairs 
congress approved home rule in 1974 barry is only the citys 
second mayor to be elected but took back some of the powers 15 
years later 
both houses passed a proposed constitutional amendment for 
statehood in 1978 but it expired seven years later when only 16 of 
the required 38 states ratified it 
new legislation is expected to be introduced in congress again 
in the near future 
but before the districts chances for statehood are improved 
touchy issues having nothing to do with the mayor need to be 
resolved one is the question of whether the city should still get 
an annual payment from the federal government another is the 
difficulty of winning republican support for statehood when the 
district with its overwhelmingly black population almost 
certainly would wind up with two democratic senators 
the view from the prostatehood forces not surprisingly is 
that barrys arrest will not do lasting harm 
we will persevere said josephine butler chairwoman of the 
districts statehood commission 
his arrest is important but it is a shortterm thing while 
statehood is enduring statehood has been a long and tedious 
process and we will overcome this and our other problems 
the board is advertising the citys unique status with road 
signs that say welcome to the nations last colony all 
residents must leave their rights at the border dc statehood 
now 
walter fauntroy the citys nonvoting delegate in the house 
sees a possible silver lining in barrys difficulties envisioning 
a city with a new mayor fauntroy said members of congress who 
would use a man who admittedly has a problem no longer have 
that excuse 
whatever the impact on the city there is no doubting the effect 
on barrys fortunes 
longtime barry fundraiser robert johnson president of black 
entertainment television said he would not back any reelection 
effort by the mayor several influential ministers said likewise 
as did a prominent business group that has supported the citys 
leader in the past 
barry who entered a private treatment facility in west palm 
beach fla for what an aide said was treatment of alcoholism has 
not said publicly what his political plans are but sources have 
said he has said he would not seek a new term 
with each new sign that barrys political career may be doomed 
more attention is paid to jackson whose move to the nations 
capital last year fueled rumors that he might make a bid for the 
mayors chair 
through the week the mystery surrounding jackson remained the 
same he said time and again that he is not interested in running 
for mayor he also repeatedly refused to rule out the possibility 
that he might get into the race if barry bows out 
a public servant never says never jackson said 
meanwhile a group of prominent local labor leaders and 
businessmen held a pair of meetings to devise a draftjackson 
strategy a separate group of attorneys did the same thing

a real estate agent dubbed robin hud after 
admitting she stole millions of dollars in federal housing funds 
and gave some money to the poor says she has decided to accept a 
bargain with prosecutors and plead guilty to two counts 
i dont want to spend taxpayers money in a court 
proceeding marilyn louise harrell told the sun in baltimore on 
friday 
harrell 46 of waldorf has admitted taking millions in us 
department of housing and urban development money and said she has 
prepared herself for imprisonment since 1985 when she first 
started diverting hud funds 
scheduled to appear monday in us district court harrell said 
she hopes to be sentenced to perform community service but regards 
prison as a chance to get a college degree 
i told the kids her son john and his wife vicki just 
think of it as mom going away a few years for college said 
harrell who will become a grandmother sometime next month 
in a deal with the us attorneys office harrell said she will 
plead guilty to stealing government property and failing to report 
income for taxes 
in return prosecutors will drop two other tax counts two 
counts of lying to hud and one count of lying to a bank on a loan 
application harrell said 
she was to go to trial on those charges monday if convicted on 
all counts she would have faced a maximum of 31 years in prison 
and more than 1 million in fines 
the two charges she says she will admit to monday carry a 
maximum sentence of 13 years in prison but under federal 
sentencing guidelines she could serve 2 to 3 years in prison 
harrell said 
harrells attorney anthony r gallagher declined to comment 
friday as did gary p jordan first assistant us attorney the 
newspaper said attempts by the associated press to reach them by 
telephone saturday were unsuccessful there was no answer at their 
offices and their home numbers are unlisted there was no answer at 
harrells home saturday 
harrell who confessed her crimes to government officials in 
december 1988 became a symbol of mismanagement at hud when scandal 
erupted there last summer following her indictment last november 
us attorney general richard l thornburgh said the case was the 
single largest involving the theft of federal funds by an 
individual 
harrell went against the advice of her attorney and freely 
discussed taking the money in testimony before congress and in 
several nationally televised interviews 
i never did have a problem with pleading guilty on no 1 the 
embezzlement charge harrell said obviously thats something 
thats known nationwide 
prosecutors say harrell took at least 567 million from sales 
of hud properties she handled as a private escrow agent 
prosecutors acknowledge that some money went to charities but say 
much of it went to harrell and her family 
harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only 475 
million in hud funds and that less than 6 percent of the money 
benefited her family 
many charities and individuals acknowledge having received 
thousands of dollars in gifts and donations from harrell but she 
has said she does not want those people to testify on her behalf 
i really truthfully consider it an honor to give up years of 
my life to help some of the people ive helped she said

keson kaleu was able to save 
three of her own children and four of a strangers but when she 
arrived in this ivorian village she broke down and cried for the 
son she said was shot by liberian soldiers 
they killed my child the young woman wailed as she limped 
into kanta yole ending a twoday trek through dense forest and 
across the cavally river 
here 300 ivorian villagers are sharing their homes and meager 
food supplies with more than 900 people who say they survived a 
massacre by liberian government troops 
bloodshed began dec 24 when rebels supporting former civil 
servant charles taylor tried to overthrow the government of 
president samuel doe 
government troops were sent in to put down rebel attacks in 
eastern liberia and a western diplomat and an ivorian official 
said thursday the soldiers had killed about 500 civilians 
liberian officials say troops shot some civilians but only 
armed civilians who attacked them 
the western diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
rebels retaliated by moving south and slaughtering citizens from 
does krahn tribe one of several ethnic groups in liberia 
ivorian officials and international aid agency workers visiting 
kanta yole when mrs kaleu arrived during the weekend asked her to 
describe the killing of her son but she was too distraught even to 
repeat his name 
they just shot him down as we ran to hide she kept saying 
as she nursed a crying baby 
later she told a reporter it was samuel does soldiers who 
killed my baby 
mrs kaleu has three daughters but male children are valued 
above females in africa 
in her misery she failed to see the happy reunion of moses duo 
and his four children mrs kaleu hid the children in the thick 
bush every time she heard the gunfire that still echoes from across 
the liberian border 
english teacher john m layweah 44 who fled the liberian town 
of kahnplay on jan 3 said the sounds of battle reached kanta yole 
on tuesday 
new refugees say the rebels pushed the government forces out 
of the town he said 
layweah said nearly 192 residents of the town of 3000 
including mrs kaleu have found their way to kanta yole kahnplay 
is 60 miles from the border and kanta yole is five miles beyond 
refugees have crowded into the small thatched huts of the 
villagers many have relatives here 
forty and 50 people are sleeping headtotoe in huts designed 
for 10 said the rev gnalla henri a roman catholic priest who 
came from the nearby town of danane with 25 blankets 
reunited with his three daughters and son duo took them to a 
halffinished hut of sticks and palm fronds he began building when 
he arrived wednesday 
he said he lost his children in the chaos of trying to dodge 
bullets 
first we hid under the beds when the firing stopped for 
awhile my daughter started crying that a child was dead i crawled 
to the hallway and saw the body of a neighbors child thats when 
we ran for the bushes even though there was still gunfire and the 
next thing i did not know where my children were 
fears that haunt the refugees surfaced at kanta yole when 
villagers accused two new arrivals of being collaborators who led 
government troops to hiding places of some victims and helped 
soldiers set homes ablaze 
they gathered in muttering groups around a hut where the accused 
men were dragged before a village headman he struck one of them 
with a belt when the man tried to declare his innocence the 
headman said he would hand over the two men to the ivorian military 
layweah described the beginning of the conflict which has 
forced more than 72000 liberians to flee to ivory coast and guinea 
in kahnplay we were celebrating new years day when we heard 
gunfire we ran into our homes then the rebels moved in and 
demanded that we cook them food 
later that night the soldiers came we fled into the bush to 
escape and watched them just rattle off their guns into peoples 
homes god knows how many innocent people died 
layweah said he did not know the aims of the rebels but said 
it is obvious that does soldiers are out to kill off the gio and 
mano people how else can you explain such barbaric and unprovoked 
attacks 
liberia has more than 15 ethnic groups the guere gio and mano 
tribes who live along the eastern and northern border long have 
complained of oppression by does krahn people who comprise about 
5 percent of the population but dominate positions of power 
doe seized power in 1980 from the descendants of freed american 
slaves who founded liberia in 1847

allow foreigners to leave and emergency supplies to be brought in 
in a broadcast monitored in london on saturday the sudan 
peoples liberation army or spla said the ceasefire was agreed 
upon during a meeting with an unidentified us diplomat 
representing the united states britain and international relief 
agencies 
it said the meeting took place friday in the ethiopian capital 
the broadcast said rebels agreed to stop shelling juba for 12 
hours monday to allow evacuation of foreigners the only foreigners 
known to be in juba are relief workers 
there was no immediate comment from sudanese government 
officials 
the government suspended international relief flights to 
waraffected areas in southern sudan on nov 3 raising fears that 
hundreds of thousands of malnourished sudanese would die of famine 
in 1988 the united nations estimated that 250000 people died of 
starvation in the wartorn area others put the figure at twice 
that 
on wednesday the government said it would allow relief 
organizations to airlift 5000 tons of food donated by the european 
economic community from nairobi kenya to juba 
the government also said it had given permission to the 
international committee of the red coss to airlift relief supplies 
to juba and rebelheld areas the red cross said it hopes to begin 
relief flights monday 
within that period the spla would not shell juba nor would 
it shoot at the planes evacuating these foreigners the broadcast

should any military plane fly into juba at times not within 
the specified hours these agreements will be rendered null and 
void the broadcast warned 
juba has been under periodic artillery bombardment from the 
rebels

town of umm dawrayn and assumed full control of the entire umm 
dawrayn district

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi 
arrived here saturday to discuss the civil war in his country and 
to ask portuguese officials to help mediate the conflict in their 
former colony 
the war between the ussupported guerrillas and marxist 
government forces began when angola became independent from 
portugual 16 years ago 
portugal had refused savimbi an entry visa until peace talks 
began in earnest in june with the signing of a shortlived 
ceasefire agreement 
the nineday visit takes savimbi away from the battlefront 
where 12000 of his guerrillas are holding off what rebel officers 
describe as the biggest government offensive ever mounted against 
the rebel movement 
a few hours before savimbi landed in lisbon angolan deputy 
defense minister colonel antonio paulo kassoma arrived for an 
official visit that will include talks on military cooperation 
between the two countries 
hundreds of supporters many from the 150000strong angolan 
community shouted viva savimbi and waved rebel flags as the 
guerrilla leader arrived at lisbon airport aboard a private jet 
i hope my contacts in portugal will help open a new chapter in 
which our two peoples can move forward together toward peace in 
angola savimbi said in brief remarks at the airport he then drove 
in an armorplated limousine through streets lined with posters 
calling for peace and democracy in angola 
in a later speech to a group of prominent political figures he 
said portugal could serve as a link between the rebels and the 
government serving as a moderator helping to bring about a 
sincere and honest dialogue savimbi said president mario soares 
would receive him in an unofficial capacity prime minister anibal 
cavaco silva and other government leaders have declined to confirm 
reports they will also meet savimbi in a private capacity 
alcides sakala a spokesman for the guerrillas known as the 
national union for the total independence of angola or unita 
said of savimbi no important political figure will fail to meet 
him 
savimbi has said that portugal the colonial ruler of angola for 
four centuries could play a more important role in peace talks 
portugal needs to be better informed about what is happening 
in angola so that it can better fulfill the role of a mediator 
savimbi told a portuguese newspaper before his visit without the 
portuguese the reconstruction of angola will never be possible 
zaires president mobuto sese seko is the official mediator of 
peace efforts in angola but unita and the angolan government have 
both said portugal has a part to play in furthering the peace 
process 
savimbi said discussions on angola between cavaco silva and 
president bush in washington earlier this month show that portugal 
has a role to play 
western diplomats in lisbon said cavaco silva had urged the 
united states to take a more evenhanded approach to the angolan 
conflict giving greater recognition to the angolan government 
washington has repeatedly refused to recognize the angolan 
government and reportedly supplies savimbi with 50 million a year 
in military aid

rafael leonardo callejas was sworn 
in saturday as president and pledged to work for peace in central 
america where he said people live with machinegun fire and 
terror 
vice president dan quayle and four latin american presidents 
were among dignitaries from 60 nations at the inauguration which 
marked honduras first peaceful transfer of power to an opposition 
party in 57 years 
callejas urged central americans to unite to fight for dignity 
and progress in our republics because nobody in the world has the 
right to choose our destiny searching for greater progress and 
winning dignity and honor 
he also outlined goals of raising the life expectancy and 
literacy rates creating more jobs reducing the nations debt 
selling off stateowned companies and improving public health in 
one of the poorest nations in the western hemisphere 
we are confronting our worst economic problems honduras has 
faced in its history as a republic however it will not discourage 
us because we are convinced that by adopting adequate measures in 
an opportune manner and rousing up national willingness we will 
move ahead callejas said 
callejas 46 comes from a landholding family and was trained as 
an agricultural economist at mississippi state university he was 
not expected to change honduras strong ties to the united states 
the national party candidate won the election nov 26 by beating 
carlos flores of the governing liberal party he replaces jose 
azcona hoyo 
the new president of the legislature rodolfo irias navas 
placed the presidential sash on callejas whose term runs through 
january 1994 among the 40000 people attending the ceremony at the 
national soccer stadium were presidents vincio cerezo of guatemala 
carlos andres perez of venezuela alfredo cristiani of el salvador 
and oscar arias of costa rica 
callejas said peace will come to the region only through 
cooperation with other governments 
lasting peace in central america will come only when it is 
built through the reduction of armies and the elimination of 
offensive arms he declared 
we must systematically apply democracy so nobody in central 
america is threatened by tanks and solders and so nobody believes 
that the opportunities for personal development are available only 
for the few he said 
our central american sister countries still live with 
machinegun fire and terror he said 
relations between honduras and nicaragua have been tense for 
years because honduras has allowed antisandinista contra rebels to 
set up bases on its territory 
callejas has said he wants the usbacked rebels removed but 
wants to keep close military relations with the united states 
which maintains an air base in honduras he made no specific 
mention about the contras or us base in his inaugural address 
 
the new president has promised to decentralize the government 
sell some stateowned companies and create incentives for 
investment and exports 
honduras has a per capita income of about 500 
honduras principal exports are bananas coffee beef lumber 
metals and sugar its major trading partner is the united states 
honduras returned to elected government in 1980 after nearly 20 
years of military rule 
the last time there was a partytoparty transition came in 
1933 when tiburcio carias andino of the national party took over 
from liberal vicente mejia colindres carias didnt allow another 
vote until 1948

id like to get rid of the misconception that i got drunk ran 
the ship aground and just shrugged my shoulders and walked away 
because thats just not what happened hazelwood said in an 
interview with the associated press last week in his new york 
lawyers office 
the 43yearold former captain of the tanker exxon valdez is 
scheduled to go on trial monday in anchorage superior court 
judge karl johnstone expects to spend at least the first day 
briefing news media representatives about courtroom rules and 
considering motions before jury selection begins in what could be 
at least a sixweek trial 
hazelwoods attorneys recently submitted motions after losing 
several efforts to have charges dismissed in various courts 
including johnstones there are new analytical twists to the 
latest motions but essentially they are the same as earlier 
requests 
one challenges the states jurisdiction in the case and another 
seeks to prohibit as evidence the results of a bloodalcohol test 
that hazelwood failed about 10 hours after the exxon valdez ran 
aground 
the hull of the tanker ripped open march 24 on a charted reef in 
prince william sound and gushed nearly 11 million gallons of alaska 
crude into the pristine waters the oil blackened shores in the 
sound and the gulf of alaska killed thousands of animals and 
disrupted commercial fishing seasons exxon says the cleanup has 
cost 2 billion 
hazelwood who was not on the bridge when the crash happened 
faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges 
of operating a vessel while intoxicated reckless endangerment and 
negligent discharge of oil 
the charges carry combined maximum penalties of seven years 
three months in prison and 61000 in fines 
defense attorney dick madson is expected to argue that hazelwood 
left sound instructions for members of the crew and cannot be held 
criminally responsible for their actions third mate gregory 
cousins was at the wheel of the 987foot tanker when it ran into 
bligh reef after leaving designated shipping lanes 
anchorage assistant district attorney brent cole would not 
discuss the prosecutions plans in the past prosecutors have said 
that hazelwood should have been at the helm since he was the ships 
only authorized navigator for prince william sound his lawyers say 
the coast guard relaxed the rules in 1986 
in an affidavit accompanying a subpoena served friday on cousins 
in tampa fla cole said hazelwood put the tanker on a southward 
course to avoid ice and set the automatic pilot before he left the 
ship in cousins hands 
cousins said he would not talk to reporters before testifying at 
hazelwoods trial ill be saying it all in anchorage probably 
over and over cousins said 
madson said witnesses will include a computer expert who will 
discuss a computer simulation for the ships course the witness 
will testify the ship would have cleared bligh reef had hazelwoods 
instructions been followed madson said 
he also plans to call crew members and experts on naval 
architecture and the physical effects of alcohol 
hazelwood is expected to be in the courtroom for the whole 
trial the seaman has been living with his wife and teenage 
daughter in huntington ny on long island and working as a 
lobsterman in the months since exxon fired him 
before his tanker ran aground the longest he had been ashore 
since he was an adolescent was two or three months 
i get stark crazy when i am too far from the salt water he 
said chainsmoking at the interview in manhattan 
hazelwood said he is confident that once alaskans hear the case 
against him they will agree that this was a tragic accident 
nothing more 
his trial originally scheduled for october in valdez the port 
town from which the tanker sailed a few hours before the accident 
was delayed as the court system reassigned judges and processed 
thick stacks of motions 
the trial was moved to anchorage on grounds a fair proceeding 
could not be obtained in valdez and because alaskas largest city 
has a substantial jury pool and facilities needed for extensive 
media coverage 
court officials said it could take at least a week to screen 
about 75 prospective jurors for 12 jury positions plus those of 
alternates

nelson mandela does not want 
to be freed from jail until the government ends its state of 
emergency and legalizes the african national congress the wife of 
the antiapartheid leader said saturday 
winnie mandela also said her husband wants the government to 
allow exiled african national congress officials to return home as 
a condition to his freedom 
previously mandelas colleagues have said the anc leader was 
eager to go free as soon as the government approved his 
unconditional release 
however mrs mandela returning to johannesburg after a 
fourhour visit to victor verster prison farm near cape town said 
her husband would refuse freedom until the government ended the 
state of emergency lifted the ban on the anc and allowed exiled 
anc officials to return 
i think the government has serious problems meeting the 
demands the government has to meet before his release she said 
there is no question of him walking out of victor verster without 
those demands having been met 
the demands she mentioned have also been listed by the anc as 
conditions the government must meet before the guerrilla movement 
agrees to negotiations mandelas release was widely expected to 
precede any lifting of the ban on the anc 
it is quite clear there are a lot of hurdles along the way 
mrs mandela told journalists when she emerged from the prison 
it is quite clear problems have cropped up about his immediate 
release 
mrs mandela appeared pensive and uneasy after visiting her 
husband 
three weeks ago she emerged from a visit brimming with optimism 
that his freedom was imminent she said mandela was in lower 
spirits on this visit 
mandela 71 has been jailed since 1962 and is serving a life 
sentence for helping plan the start of the ancs antigovernment 
sabotage campaign he is the countrys bestknown black leader and 
the government has expressed interest in his offer to mediate in 
negotiations with the anc 
president fw de klerk has said he would like to remove 
obstacles to negotiations and is expected to speak about the ancs 
conditions in an address to parliament on feb 2 
in other developments saturday officials of the staterun south 
african transport services and the south african railway and harbor 
workers union signed an agreement ending one of the countrys most 
violent strikes 
the union failed to win even part of its requested 150 percent 
pay increase but the company agreed to recognize the union and 
rehire all of the 23000 strikers who were fired 
the workers had demanded that their minimum monthly wage be 
increased from 240 to 600 
numerous battles occurred between strikers and nonstrikers 
railway coaches and tracks were sabotaged with a loss to the 
company estimated at 16 million the company employs about 170000 
people and runs rail and harbor operations nationwide

mixedrace residents arrived at a whitesonly lakeside park for a

the park was declared whitesonly in late 1988 after the 
farright conservative party took control of the city council in 
municipal elections 
no serious injuries were reported in the clash

the street names are the same the 
faces familiar gossip still makes the circuit drugs sometimes 
change hands and families still struggle to get by 
this is no longer the el chorrillo neighborhood however but 
its essence distilled down by an invasion and filtered into an 
airplane hangar at albrook field a jointuse air base used by us 
and panamanian forces 
we paid the highest price for the invasion says francisco 
martinez we had little but we lost it all 
martinez is among the estimated 16000 refugees from el 
chorrillo the neighborhood with the bad luck to be the home of the 
panamanian defense forces headquarters the us armys main target 
during the invasion of panama on dec 20 
president bush on thursday proposed giving 1 billion in 
economic aid to panama and local officials said they are 
discussing plans to provide new homes for the refugees 
but despite those good intentions the refugees most likely will 
be living in tents or in small cubbyholes in a big hangar for at 
least a year 
it is unjust things ought to move a lot faster these people 
need a home said sergio galvez director of the camp sheltering 
3500 refugees on the northwestern edge of panama city 
a us civilian affairs group is working with panamanian 
officials trying to determine how to house the homeless while 
rebuilding goes on 
we can only make recommendations said vince ryan a houston 
city councilman who is a member of the group the panamanian 
government must make a decision they are talking about different 
things that could be done ranging from building apartment 
buildings giving each family credit to build a home or turning 
this area into a commercial area 
but anyone who tells you they can rebuild in nine months is an 
optimist said ryan 
families live in partitions made of wooden frames and canvas 
some of the alleys have been given names of streets from the old 
neighborhood less than two miles away 
no gossips allowed reads a piece of canvas that serves as a 
door on one of the partitions 
gossip and disinformation are some of the problems said 
galvez people get desperate there are nearly 6000 unemployed 
among those who lost their homes some people go around telling 
others that the us army is giving cash to every family and 
within minutes you have a mob asking for the money 
everybody is looking out for himself said miguel martinez 
23 we were not a very united community back in el chorrillo 
martinez was working as a helper in a home for the elderly next 
to el chorrillos church when the us effort to oust gen manuel 
antonio noriega began at 1230 am us officials say most of the 
damage wasnt caused by the attack itself but by fires set by 
noriega supporters 
we got everyone out safely the next morning martinez said 
the church did not burn down 
i guess i could go back but im trying to help here some of 
us get together and do volunteer work distributing medicines food 
cleaning up and doing other jobs we are here sharing the suffering 
of our brothers he said 
polio left manelis sanchez 19 without the use of his legs he 
was a popular figure in el chorrillo moving around on his crutches 
doing odd jobs or going to a busy corner downtown where he stopped 
cars and asked drivers for money for an operation 
he lived in a shack next to the church 
i was in bed when they started shooting he said my 
friend told me this is bushs christmas gift for noriega 
there are problems at the camp a security officer said there 
was some lowlevel drug selling and consumption 
remember a lot of the people in el chorillo lived off the sale 
and distribution of drugs and contraband said the officer who 
refused to give his name 
this week the us army stopped distributing ration packages to 
the refugees from now on food will have to come from private 
donations 
us soldiers still provide security but camp administration is 
being taken over by the panamanian red cross with help from the 
us agency for international development caritas a roman 
catholic charity and other charities 
it was a tough neighborhood they are boisterous complain 
about things want their own kind of food and are always arguing 
you have to understand them galvez said you must understand 
the trauma of an invasion the desperation of living in a refugee 
camp while others are discussing how long you are going to stay 
here and you hear them saying a year 
el chorrillo has been leveled and cleared by us army 
engineers most of the wooden threestory structures dating back to 
the beginning of the century are gone still standing are three 
concrete apartment buildings in need of extensive repairs 
estimates of the cost of rebuilding el chorrillo alone range 
from 30 million to 50 million the white house said thursday that 
it was earmarking 42 million in aid for housing emergency public 
works small business rehabilitation for looting victims and 
technical assistance to the government 
it is not certain congress will approve everything bush wants 
even though president guillermo endara said even 1 billion is only 
half what panama needs

president bushs 123 trillion federal budget 
for fiscal 1991 will contain a warning to congress from budget 
director richard g darman against seeking a wonderland in 
which military savings can be diverted to domestic programs 
administration officials said today 
the nearterm peace dividend is likely to be smaller than 
commonly assumed darman tells congress in an introduction to the 
budget document the officials said 
bushs budget plan will propose a reduction of the federal 
deficit to 631 billion roughly half as much as the current 
expected deficit through a series of austere military and domestic 
programs said the officials who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity 
bush will propose total spending of 1233 trillion and will 
project revenues to the government at 117 trillion 
the budget includes an austere 2921 billion for the pentagon 
which works out to a slight increase over current spending but a 
reduction of about 2 percent after inflation is taken into account 
the sources said 
some members of congress have proposed that the reductions in 
military tensions in eastern europe can be turned into a socalled 
peace dividend and spent on expanding social programs 
darman however will tell congress it would be naively 
euphoric to expect that the crumbling of the soviet empire will 
spell a final end to eastwest tensions 
in his preface to the budget to be formally submitted on 
monday darman will compare the federal budget to the ultimate 
cookie monster a reference to the character in the popular 
childrens television show sesame street the officials said 
speaking on the condition of anonymity 
its excess tendencies toward consumption are not exactly 
ennoblingbut at the same time its underlying motivation is 
clearly not malevolent what harm it might cause is largely 
unintended 
excerpts from darmans introduction first published in todays 
editions of the new york times were confirmed by administration 
officials 
darman also will tell congress that many programs in the budget 
are like pacman in the popular video game waiting to spring 
forward and consume another line of resources dots in the budget 
maze 
details of the budget were surfacing on friday in advance of the 
formal submission to congress 
bush himself tipped his hand on one major program increase 
announcing the proposal for the increase in spending on the head 
start program for lowincome children he said every youngster 
deserves the opportunity for a full and happy life 
bush said the new funds would permit head starts enrollment to 
grow to 667000 children or 70 percent of the nations 
disadvantaged fouryearolds currently it reaches 39 percent of 
eligible youths 
however the budget will also contain spending cuts and program 
slowdowns 
veterans will be among the victims of bushs proposed cutbacks 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the budget 
would require veterans to make down payments on va loans for the 
first time 4 percent on loans of over 25000 
larry w rivers executive director of the veterans of foreign 
wars called it an unreasonable proposal that dashes the 
dreams of countless veterans of participating in the american dream 
of home ownership 
bush who frequently says he wants to be remembered as the 
education president was proposing a 500 million overall 
increase in education spending but at the expense of some programs 
for instance the budget would reduce the guaranteed student 
loan program by 500 million sources said another 155 million 
would be cut from the perkins loan program for lowincome college 
students 
and although bush will call for longterm increases in pell 
grants another source of money for lowincome students his budget 
will reflect a cut in the grants by some 665 million for this 
coming fall as a result more than 13 students will either have 
their stipends reduced or eliminated the sources said 
overall its an inadequate investment said gerald morris 
deputy director of legislation for the american federation of 
teachers 
according to administration and congressional officials the 
budget will also include 
the most austere pentagon budget in more than a decade bush 
will propose 292 billion in new outlays up slightly from current 
spending but representing a 2 percent cut after adjusting for 
inflation however the budget will include a request for increased 
spending on the strategic defense initiative to 48 billion up 
from 38 billion this year 
more money for fish wildlife and recreation plus a cutback in 
federal timber sales 
a new family savings account that would allow people to 
earn taxfree interest and dividends on money that is squirreled 
away for at least seven years with contributions of up to 5000 
per year per family 
no new general tax hikes and a renewal of bushs call for a 
lower capital gains tax rate a tax credit for adoptions and one 
for child care 
a 85 billion slash in medicare funds 
bush has also announced that he will seek a 11 billion 
increase to 106 billion for the war on drugs 
some 24000 of the bluejacketed 1592page budget documents 
are being printed and they will go on sale on monday at government 
bookshops for 38 apiece 
but a new government economic report was already raising doubts 
about the administrations assertions that the bush budget would 
lower the federal deficit to 64 billion as required by the 
grammrudman budget balancing law 
the commerce department reported friday that economic growth in 
the last three months of 1989 fell to an annual rate of 05 percent 
when adjusted for inflation considerably worse than projected by 
the office of management and budget as it put together the economic 
assumptions for the new budget 
the economic figures will make total hash of the 
administrations claims that its spending outline can significantly 
reduce the budget deficit said michael evans president of a 
washingtonbased economic forecasting service

the cold muddy water of the swollen 
amite river began receding saturday from washedout roads bridges 
and flooded homes and officials said they expected heavy damage in 
its wake 
itll be a while before we have any good estimates we still 
cant get into a lot of the places because theyre still flooded 
said red cross disaster director bob hernandez 
all i can tell you is that a lot of people are comparing it to 
1983 which was the worst we ever had and the red cross spent 
125 million in that one he said 
in 83 the amite crested at 405 feet near baton rouge the 
highest crest in 100 years the river crested at 395 feet 
saturday hernandez said 
no injuries or deaths had been reported in the flooding by 
saturday 
the floodwaters receded in baton rouge and nearby denham springs 
in the morning to the south in ascension parish water didnt 
begin falling until later in the day 
the flooding resulted from heavy rains wednesday and thursday 
over the amite river basin primarily north of baton rouge 
also 12 to 15 inches of rain fell in 36 hours last week in the 
upper comite basin in southwestern mississippi which drains to the 
amite and comite rivers said malcolm moreau of the national 
weather service in baton rouge 
more than 30 roads and highways in southeastern louisiana were 
closed saturday because of flooding 
in the denham springs area almost 150 singlefamily homes and 
house trailers were damaged an early survey revealed hernandez 
said 
we know itll be more than that he said weve just 
started looking most of what were seeing is major damage we had 
water up to the tops of trailers in the second floor of 
splitlevel houses 
about half of the approximately 50 homes in one east baton rouge 
subdivision flooded with up to 3 inches of water homeowners 
estimated thousands of dollars in damage 
most residents left the subdivision late friday either taking 
their possessions with them or mounting what they could on cinder 
blocks 
people knew this flood was coming and prepared for it 
beforehand said hernandez thats going to help keep the 
damage to possessions down 
the national weather service predicted a 20 percent chance of 
rain saturday night and sunday but state department of public 
works officials did not expect new problems 
about 38 people spent friday night in shelters in denham 
springs said don eisenberg director of the baton rouge chapter of 
the red cross he said the shelter would stay open until residents 
can make their homes habitable

an environmental group on saturday urged the 
government to protect penguins and other antarctic wildlife by 
regulating companies that take tourists to that icebound continent 
repeated tourist visits will cause animals to abandon their 
breeding sites or increase the vulnerability of their eggs and 
young to predation environmental defense fund attorney bruce 
manheim said in a statement 
the new yorkbased group issued a report calling on the national 
science foundation the state department and the coast guard to 
establish a licensing system to ensure no damage to antarctica from 
tour groups 
although remote and generally inhospitable antarctica is now 
visited by thousands of tourists each year who wish to see the 
continents pristine environment before it could be despoiled 
the report said 
it said most tourists are seriously concerned about protecting 
antarctica but their visits are often localized repetitive and 
frequently occur at breeding grounds for penguins seals and other 
seabirds 
the report said frequent helicopter visits by the first 
tourists to antarctica diplomats and dignitaries visiting mcmurdo 
station quickly resulted in a 50 percent reduction in the 
southernmost adelie penguin rookery at cape royds 
it said antarctic tourism is growing and one australian company 
hopes to develop and a hardsurface runway and luxury hotel on the 
continent 
currently however most of the tour companies are american and 
thus the federal government could do much to limit environmental 
damage it said 
the group urged a ban on aircraft overflights within 1500 
meters of wildlife sites guidelines on government observation of 
wildlife management plans for wildlife sites advance information 
requirements for expeditions and coordination of tour visits to 
wildlife areas 
it also called for a monitoring program to assess the impact of 
such visits a ban on the disposal of oil plastics and garbage 
from tour vessels and strict regulation of vessel operations in 
waters off antarctica 
the report was released on the first anniversary of the 
grounding of the bahia paraiso an argentine tour vessel that 
spilled more than 180000 gallons of oil into wildlife breeding 
areas the report said a year after antarcticas most 
significant environmental disaster we still dont have regulations 
to prevent similar catastrophes it said

four men who were highranking 
officials in nicolae ceausescus regime went on trial saturday on 
charges they contributed to the deaths of hundreds of people during 
last months revolution 
one of the four former politburo member ion dinca told the 
court he was an accomplice to criminal measures ordered by 
ceausescu to try to crush the uprising 
dinca was the only one of the defendants called to testify 
during saturdays fourhour session but the prosecution presented 
declarations it said were from each of the defendants admitting 
their guilt 
on trial are former communist party secretary emil bobu former 
interior minister tudor postelnicu and former politburo members 
manea manescu and dinca 
they are charged with complicity in genocide in connection with 
the deaths of hundreds of people during the december revolution 
that ousted ceausescus government and face life in prison at hard 
labor if convicted 
the military prosecutor col aurel cosma said each man could 
have prevented the killings of at least 689 people shot to death by 
troops by asking ceausescu to resign instead they backed his 
order to shoot protesters cosma said before presenting the 
declarations purported to be from the accused 
cosma did not say when the declarations were given 
i was a beast because i agreed to the orders of nicolae 
ceausescu said a statement attributed to postelnicu 59 who 
partly controlled the securitate secret police i decided to 
fight alongside him until the end he said 
bobu considered the no 3 official in the government behind 
ceausescu and his wife elena was quoted as saying i didnt 
take a position my attitude was contemptible i was the one who 
suggested cremation of the victims in timisoara to hide evidence 
of the military action 
the revolt began in the western city of timisoara 
manescu 74 was quoted as saying i asked nicolae ceausescu 
not to resign i ordered fire with war munitions i agreed with the 
armys repression 
everyone with no exception proved to be cowards we carried 
out ceausescus orders said dinca 62 
hundreds of people crowded into a hall at the romanian military 
academy in bucharest to view the trial the first of former 
ceausescu associates since the dictator and his wife were tried in 
secret on genocide charges and executed christmas day 
the defendants entered the dock without handcuffs guarded by 
two armed policemen postelnicu appeared on the verge of tears 
prosecuting ceausescu loyalists is a key test of the provisional 
government which is struggling to gain the support of the people 
before free elections in may 
the trial opened one day after the vice president of the 
provisional government resigned claiming that stalinist 
methods were being used by the nations new leaders 
the charges referred to ceausescu and his wife as the 
authors of the genocide but said the four defendants did not 
act to block the ceausescus and therefore were guilty of complicity 
one of the issues raised at the session was of the events that 
led to security forces being ordered to open fire on demonstrators 
dinca in his testimony said he and four other politburo 
members opposed the presidents demand that they shoot at 
protesters and told ceausescu so at a politburo meeting dec 17 
it was the first time that ceausescu met with opposition from 
the politburo he said he got up from the council table very 
nervous and said will you please elect another general secretary 
if you dont agree with me 
dinca said some politburo members then gave their support to 
ceausescu who went ahead with the orders to shoot protesters 
i consider myself his accomplice in what he did dinca said 
if any of us had tried to oppose him others would have allied 
with us and we would have managed to convince him to give up such 
an order 
he added i didnt have the courage i didnt do it because of 
cowardice 
i gave my help to ceausescu to put into practice the criminal 
measures to suffocate in blood the justified revolution of the 
people he said 
the revolution was justified he said because romanians were 
deprived of basic human rights food medicine and energy to heat 
their homes 
ceausescu forced romanias 23 million people to endure 
hardships exporting food and energy supplies for heating as he 
sought to pay off romanias 10 billion foreign debt 
on dec 22 dinca said ceausescu called an emergency politburo 
meeting and asked if anyone objected to the steps he was taking to 
crush the revolt which by then had spread to bucharest and other 
cities 
everybody there said they would fight to the end dinca said 
by then defense minister vasile milea who had refused to shoot 
at protesters had himself been shot to death by proceausescu 
forces 
the ceausescus boarded a helicopter to flee bucharest on dec 
22 they were caught and executed christmas day after being 
convicted of genocide and ruining the economy the death penalty 
has since been outlawed 
under questioning from cosma dinca said milea told ceausescu on 
dec 17 that he had examined all the military regulations and 
didnt find anywhere that the armed forces should shoot the 
people 
before dinca finished testifying his three codefendants were 
asked if they had any questions for him manescu and bobu said no 
but postelnicu referring to shorthand transcripts of the 
politburo meetings said i think there are many lies in these 
papers 
the tribunal president col andrei nitoui said postelnicu 
could say more about that when he testifies 
nitoui adjourned the tribunal until monday

welders on saturday cut down the word 
lenin from the sign over the gates to the shipyard where the 
solidarity movement was born and removed a statue of the soviet 
communist founder from the plant 
the tributes to vladimir i lenin had remained at the 
stateowned shipyard even after solidarity had forced the 
communists to give up power in poland following parliamentary 
elections last year 
workers laughing and applauding removed the lenin sign as the 
polish communists were gathering in warsaw for a last national 
congress that is expected to create a new party with a new name and 
program 
may this symbolic act be proof of the irreversibility of the 
changes in our country a warning for those who led us to so many 
disasters said zbigniew lis head of the solidarity commission 
at the yard 
we got rid of a symbol the working class never identified 
with he said 
the solidarity committee decided to restore the old name the 
gdansk shipyard as part of plans to create a joint stock company 
at the complex the yard had been renamed the lenin shipyard 23 
years ago 
the thencommunist government announced in 1988 that the yard 
would be closed because it was unprofitable lech walesa the 
shipyard electrician who has led the union since 1980 denounced 
that decision as politically motivated 
plans for a polishborn american heiress barbara 
piaseckajohnson to invest up to 100 million in the yard fell 
through when workers would not agree to her offer 
the solidarityled government now announced plans to create a 
stock corporation from the stateowned shipyard whose shares would 
eventually be sold to investors

earlier saturday ethnic albanian opposition groups had demanded 
an end to police repression and appealed for demonstrations to 
stop saying they would only give authorities a justification for 
more repression 
in their crackdown against the protests kosovo authorities 
have once again demonstrated the lack of minimal willingness to 
tackle social problems through dialogue said a joint statement 
by the regions three newlyformed independent opposition groups 
about 100 kosovo albanians were arrested in the wake of this 
weeks unrest protesters were demanding the release of political 
prisoners and the lifting of a partial state of emergency in the

prime minister yitzhak shamir promised saturday 
to withstand us pressures for concessions on middle east peace 
issues 
he also threatened for the second time in a week to resign 
from his job if he loses a party vote of confidence 
in the west bank soldiers shot and killed two palestinians on 
saturday in a clash with stonethrowers in the village of abu dis 
arab reports said 
the army confirmed a clash in the village and said it began when 
border guards came upon masked activists at least one 
protester was wounded an army spokesman said 
officials at muqassed hospital in east jerusalem confirmed the 
deathsarab reports identified the victims as abdullah nabil 
halabiya 16 and his uncle mohammed dahoud halabiya 45 
their deaths raised to 651 the number of palestinians killed by 
israelis in the 25monthold uprising against israeli rule another 
174 arabs have been slain by fellow palestinians for alleged 
collaboration with israel and 43 israelis have died in the 
violence 
soldiers also clashed with protesters in the gaza strip and 
arab reports said five palestinians were shot and wounded 
an unidentified reservist combat captain was dismissed saturday 
after an investigation found he violated regulations in the 
shooting of a 5yearold palestinian boy jan 23 near the west bank 
town of jenin israel tv said 
the boy mohammed kadaha was seriously wounded by a rubber 
bullet that hit him in the head as soldiers dispersed

interview he understood that if the top institution of likud 
doesnt accept the policy of likuds leader then i can no longer 
fill this position 
shamir leads the rightwing likud bloc 
the likud meeting has been called for feb 7 by industry 
minister ariel sharon to debate his objections to israels plan to 
hold elections in the occupied west bank and gaza strip as part of 
an interim peace settlement 
sharon holds that the usbacked plan could jeopardize israels 
claim to these lands captured in the 1967 middle east war 
shamir said last week he would step down if sharon and his 
backers undermined party support for israels peace plan 
this time shamir added he would insist on a separate vote for 
his proposals suggesting that rejecting sharons recommendations 
would not be enough to satisfy him

james a baker iii to convene egyptian and israeli foreign 
ministers in washington 
bakers planned meeting is supposed to help prepare 
israelipalestinian dialogue in cairo on israels election proposal 
for arabs in the occupied lands 
also delaying bakers plans is disagreement over which 
palestinians may participate in peace talks israel has ruled out 
any role for the palestine liberation organization but 
palestinians consider the plo their sole representative 
shamir said highranking american officials have assured him 
that the bush administration never authorized recent published 
suggestions to reduce financial assistance to israel 
senate minority leader bob dole introduced the idea of cutting 
aid to israel at a news conference jan 16 dole suggested a 5 
percent cut to large recipients including israel which receives 
3 billion a year 
doles remarks were interpreted in israel as new pressure on 
shamir to ease his stand on peace talks

air disasters such as the avianca airlines 
crash on long island last week are becoming more survivable in 
part because design and technical advances have made jet travel 
safer many air safety experts say 
the accident rate is improving its not more dangerous its 
getting better says s harry robertson director of the crash 
research institute in tempe ariz airplanes are getting safer as 
the newer generations come along the rate of improvement is very 
significant 
capt ed arbon who flew for 22 years with twa and is now an 
official of the flight safety foundation agrees 
some of the recent improvements do make the modern aircraft 
more survivable arbon says 
eighty to 85 percent of recent crashes are survivable says 
drucella anderson a spokeswoman for the national transportation 
safety board a lot of safeguards have been built into the 
planes 
eightynine of the 161 passengers more than half survived 
the crash of avianca flight 52 into a hill on the north shore of 
long island 
preliminary inquiries suggest the craft had either run out of 
fuel or had a very low supply when it crashed thursday night on its 
way to john f kennedy international airport there was no fire 
when the 23yearold boeing 707 crashed 
but many of the experts say that the battle for air safety is 
far from over even though air travel on the whole has become 
amazingly safe and millions of passengers are transported each year 
without incident 
under new rules issued by the federal aviation administration 
and prompted by the investigation of air crashes passenger seats 
are being strengthened and have been covered with fire blocking 
material the allowable level of toxic smoke and fumes from burning 
aircraft materials also has been reduced and exit doors have been 
made more reliable to avoid jamming 
faa spokesman fred farrar said avianca like other foreign 
airlines would have been required to make some safety upgrades 
such as providing fireretardant seat covers and lavatory smoke 
alarms but it would not have been required to strengthen seats 
the latter requirements still are being adopted for foreign 
airliners farrar said 
arbon says that by the nature of its technology the modern jet 
passenger liner is a far safer plane than the piston aircraft it 
replaced 
we used to lose engines frequently he said the jetliner 
has a very reliable power plant it also has a good guidance 
system a good auto pilot the electronics are much more reliable 
robertson says improvements are continuing on the ways in 
which airplanes are informed as to what is going on and how people 
on the ground control them 
an example he says is the wind shear blamed for the august 
1985 crash of a delta airliner near the dallasft worth airport 
the people in the tower had no idea of what was going on he 
contends today they have better sensors out there so that is 
improving 
arbon said some 70 percent of todays accidents are due to the 
human factor adding that it is there that the strongest efforts 
for improvement are now being made 
ms anderson says the ntsb dates many of the improvements in air 
safety to the recommendations made after its investigation of the 
deadly fire on june 2 1983 aboard an air canada jetliner en route 
from texas to toronto 
twentythree people died aboard the plane which made an 
emergency landing at the greater cincinnati airport some suffered 
fatal burns others died of smoke inhalation 
the recommendations led to the installation of fire blocking 
covers on passenger seats on all commercial aircraft with 30 or 
more seats automatic fire extinguishers in lavatories halon fire 
extinguishers in the cockpit smoke detectors in lavatories and new 
rules on cabin materials to make the cabin interiors more flame 
resistant and less likely to emit toxic gases ms anderson said 
but there are some clouds on the safety horizon 
for example robertson said that while seats have been made 
stronger to resist the impact of a crash the floor beneath them 
has not 
before the changes the seats were folding over he said 
but when the seat is stiff it makes it easier to break it off the 
floor 
so they sometimes do pop off the floor he said and added 
maybe this step in the right direction is going to backfire 
modern technology may also have reduced the protection offered 
by the protective cocoon or fuselage of a jetliner robinson 
says 
todays planes are made from highstrength aluminum to hold down 
weight but robertson says the resulting fuselage is brittle 
they shatter and sharp fragments lie all over the crash 
site he says earlier generations of aircraft would crush 
buckle and wrinkle but the box was still there they are losing 
that cocoon protection 
robertson whose institute has been engaged in the study of air 
crashes for more than 30 years says air disasters can be divided 
into three categories 
these range from the airborne equivalent of fenderbenders 
posing small risk to those on board to deadly accidents in which 
all or most of the passengers and crew are killed 
but it is the third category middleground accidents in which 
some are killed but many survive which pose an opportunity the 
safety experts say 
the aim is to take that middle ground and expand it thus 
reducing the number of totally deadly accidents robertson said 
it is in fact being expanded 
robertson cites recent studies in which experts were asked what 
could be done to significantly improve air safety in the year 2000 
and beyond 
they said you could probably make the best contribution to 
safety if you can figure out a way to slow the planes enough to 
allow them to land at half the speed you do now robertson said 
adding that might prove difficult to achieve 
but if you can cut the speed in half you can make the greatest 
contribution to safety thats absolutely correct he said

dinkins and yankees owner george steinbrenner met friday at city 
hall and agreed to renew discussion of the fate of the team that 
steinbrenner has hinted at moving to new jersey when the yankee 
stadium lease expires in 2002 
lets face it the public perception is that there isnt 
enough parking ingress and egress is too slow and there is even 
perceptions about safety dinkins said 
we have to do some new and unique things to get people there 
one of which is to give them a winning team dinkins said 
former mayor edward i koch had all but nailed down a 30year 
extension on the yankee lease but steinbrenner said they could not 
agree on such amenities as vip suites and a restaurant with a view

government 
like many other leftists he fled el salvador after the coup but 
returned in 1987 to participate in politics

lewis mumford a critic of architecture and 
urban planning whose writings warned of the decline of cities and 
the dehumanizing influence of technology has died at age 94 
mumford who died in his sleep friday afternoon was frail 
but there was no sickness it was simply a matter of old age 
said his grandson james morss 
mumford best known for his writing on the subject of cities and 
culture was the author of more than 30 books including the city 
in history for which he received the national book award in 1961 
morss said his grandfather spent the last few years quietly 
passing the days with his wife and doing some light reading 
mumford was among 12 artists including composer aaron copland 
and film director frank capra awarded the national medal of arts 
by president reagan in a white house ceremony in 1986 recipients 
were honored for their lifetime contributions to american arts 
the illegitimate son of a businessman mumford was born in 
queens on oct 19 1895 but grew up on the west side of manhattan 
he attended city college but ill health prevented him from 
completing his degree instead he took graduate courses at 
columbia university and at the new school for social research 
it was then that he discovered the works of sir patrick geddes 
a scottish town planner whose influence he said was the most 
important one in his life 
after serving as a naval radio technician in world war i 
mumford became associate editor of the dial magazine his essays on 
housing and urban matters led him to become acting editor of the 
sociological review 
mumford cofounded the regional planning association of america 
in 1923 and served on the staff of the new york housing and 
regional planning commission 
in 1938 mumford published the culture of cities a book 
that traced the history of cities in the modern world and set forth 
proposals for their improvement the book made his international 
reputation and put him on the cover of time magazine 
he was among the earliest and most prescient critics of highways 
in manhattan in 1943 he wrote that express highways would be 
admirable if they were related to anything except the desire on 
the part of the more prosperous to get out of new york as fast as 
possible actually their function is to increase the planless 
decentralization of the metropolis and thereby pile up such a load 
of decaying properties in the center as to hasten the final 
exodus 
in addition to his writings on urban issues he wrote a weekly 
art column for the new yorker at the same time he published the 
first of four volumes in what became known as the renewal of 
life series 
a social philosopher and educator mumford implored people to 
place a higher value on human feelings and morals than on 
dehumanizing technology he feared that science and technology 
would eventually lead to a uniform allenveloping superplanetary 
structure designed for automatic operation 
man he said will then have not only conquered nature but 
detached himself as far as possible from organic habitat 
he is survived by his wife sophia daughter alison mumford 
morss of amenia and two grandchildren james of new york city 
and elizabeth of troy ny

president bushs 123 trillion budget due to 
be unveiled monday will seek to slash the federal deficit in half 
in 1991 administration sources said saturday in a spending plan 
based on pareddown defense outlays and optimistic economic 
assumptions 
bush sticking to his campaign pledge will meet his deficit 
goal without a general tax increase opting instead to save 
billions of dollars through trimming a variety of government 
programs ranging from medicare to college student loans 
the budget document bushs first solo effort to reorder the 
governments spending priorities also will contain a somewhat 
whimsical overview written by budget director richard g darman 
who likens the federal budget to the ultimate cookie monster 
the voracious gremlin on the sesame street television program 
with a generally rosy set of assumptions about economic growth 
and with a host of proposed cuts in military and domestic spending 
programs the administration projects that the deficit for 1991 
will be reduced to 631 billion just under the 64 billion 
deficit target established in the grammrudman deficit reduction 
law 
the administration projects a deficit for the current fiscal 
year of 1238 billion far above the grammrudman target of 100 
billion according to officials who have seen the budget 
projections and who spoke on condition that their names not be used 
the budget forecasts the deficit will be reduced to 251 
billion in 1992 and will actually show a surplus of 57 billion in 
1993 the year the grammrudman law calls for a balanced budget it 
projects further surpluses of 107 billion in 1994 and 94 
billion in 1995 
former president ronald reagan also submitted budgets showing 
surpluses down the road but the surpluses never materialized 
because the economic assumptions upon which the revenue and 
spending forecasts were based proved too optimistic and congress 
balked at going along with many of the program cuts 
many analysts believe a similar fate will befall the 1991 bush 
budget the presidents first complete spending blueprint last 
february he released a 193page set of amendments to reagans 
final budget 
even before its release the bush administrations assumptions 
about economic growth were being called into question the 
congressional budget office projecting lower economic growth and 
thus lower government tax revenues is estimating higher deficits 
and thus the need for sharper cuts for 1991 and following years 
bushs 1991 budget for the fiscal year beginning next oct 1 
proposes total spending of 1233 trillion and expects government 
receipts will total 1170 trillion leaving a deficit of 631 
billion 
in his budget bush will propose using a portion of the surplus 
revenues in coming years to set up a social security integrity 
and debt reduction fund which would reduce the 28 trillion 
federal debt and thus leave a more manageable financing burden 
for future generations according to darmans overview 
the fund is the administrations effort to derail a politically 
popular proposal by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny to roll 
back social security tax increases this year and in 1992 
the budget does not include any proposed general tax increase 
continuing to honor bushs nonewtaxes campaign pledge to honor 
another 1988 pledge bush will once again seek to slash taxes on 
capital gains the profits resulting from the sale of stock or 
other assets that effort is certain to generate partisan wrangling 
on capitol hill 
to deflect arguments that the capital gains reduction is a tax 
cut for the wealthy bush will unveil a proposed family savings 
account which would allow people to earn taxfree interest and 
dividends on money invested for at least seven years with 
contributions of up to 5000 per year per family 
among the budget cuts bush will propose to trim 85 billion 
from projected spending on medicare the huge health plan for 
social security recipients the money would be saved by lowering 
payments to hospitals and doctors not by curbing patient benefits 
seeking to capitalize on the lowered eastwest tensions the 
administration is proposing a pareddown pentagon budget with 
outlays totaling 2921 billion up slightly from this year but 
representing a 2 percent cut after adjusting for inflation 
the 1991 budget proposes reducing active duty military personnel 
by 38000 cutting civilian defense department employment by 5000 
and reducing the reserves by 3000 while protecting some of 
administrations pet programs such as the strategic defense 
initiative the nuclear shield in space commonly called star wars 
by 1995 defense spending will be at its lowest level 
measured either as a share of the total economy or as a portion 
of total federal spending since before world war ii defense 
secretary richard cheney said in a pentagon budget document 
obtained by the associated press from congressional sources 
to help meet the trimmed down spending levels cheney is 
scheduled to unveil on monday a sweeping list of proposed military 
base closures and reductions over the next five years targeting 
installations from philadelphia to long beach calif 
cheneys moves have already prompted cries of protest from 
members of congress who have been briefed on which installations 
are on the hit list 
darman complains that congress has widely inflated expectations 
of how much in government resources will be freed up from the 
socalled peace dividend resulting from the reduced soviet threat 
in eastern europe 
this great historical shift has been almost trivialized in its 
translation into public debate about the budget the issue has been 
framed as how big is the peace dividend and in effect how 
can i get mine darman wrote in his essay first reported in 
saturdays new york times 
darmans colorful essay titled the directors introduction to 
the budget offers a tour of the budget wonderland with 
references to the budget as the ultimate cookie monster 
its excessive tendencies toward consumption are not exactly 
ennobling darman writes 
he also likens many huge government spending programs to the 
popular video game pac man as they wait to spring forward 
and consume another line of resource dots in the budget maze 
the 1592page bush budget bound with a blue cover will go on 
sale monday at government bookstores for 38

the peoples front offered to negotiate with soviet officials a 
spokesman for the movement said by telephone late saturday from 
baku the republics capital it offered to maintain order call 
off strikes and get workers to work double shifts to make up for 
lost production 
it was unlikely that the soviet government would agree to those 
terms however 
the soviet defense minister dmitri t yazov said last week 
that soldiers and security forces were intent on rooting out a 
nationalist network from factories and staterun institutions 
but another leader of the peoples front kh hajizade said in 
a telephone interview from baku that the groups loose structure of 
small independent units was keeping the front alive the peoples 
front continues to operate whether or not its leadership is 
arrested he said 
hajizade said the front also stood ready to discuss the removal 
of soviet soldiers the fate of reform in the republic and other 
issues

withdrawal of soviet soldiers who entered the city jan 20 
tass quoted bakus military commandant lt gen vladimir

have died since troops seized control in baku that raised the 
death toll since ethnic violence began jan 13 in baku to 197 
dubnyak did not provide further details on the figures it was 
not clear how many of the deaths occurred in the assault on baku on 
jan 20 or whether the figures included the five deaths in the 
battle in the southern region of gaftona 
one soldier was among those killed in the clash between soldiers 
and armed nationalists near the caspian sea tass said four others 
were wounded and 54 people were arrested tass said it did not say 
what day the clash occurred 
tass also reported the arrests of 80 people in lenkoran and 22 
in nearby neftechala another 35 people armenians and 
azerbaijanis were arrested outside kirkidzhan the main city of 
the disputed nagornokarabakh region in azerbaijan tass said 
the national daily newspaper trud quoting military reports 
said more than 1000 military uniforms and a large cache of arms 
were seized in headquarters of the peoples front along with 
telephone lists bank passbooks passports and other belongings of 
armenians who were victims of ethnic attacks 
those attacks evolved into a fight for secession by militants in 
azerbaijan a predominantly shiite moslem republic 
rakhmi gadzhiyev identified as a leader of the proindependence 
azerbaijani peoples front and a member of the national defense 
committee the fronts militant wing was among those arrested the 
news agency tass said 
forty more members of nationalist groups linked to the peoples 
front were arrested another newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
quoted police lt col a sorokovikh in baku as saying 
but newspapers said front leaders had gone underground and were 
preparing new mass disorders 
nearly 150 people were detained in baku overnight most for 
violating curfew the reports said 
tass reported that negotiators meeting along the border between 
armenia and the nakhichevan region of azerbaijan had agreed to 
remove all armed men by sunday morning 
the two sides may have unarmed patrols of no more than 10 men on 
the roads nearby according to the agreement meeting in the 
armenian border town of eraskh the two sides agreed thursday on a 
ceasefire 
tass said the two sides exchanged 17 armenian hostages for 22 
azerbaijani hostages 
but rafael popoyan an armenian delegate reported from the 
armenian capital yerevan that shooting from the azerbaijani side 
had been reported saturday during a continuation of the talks 
the ethnic attacks in baku on jan 13 started the latest 
flareup in violence in the caucasus republics of armenia and 
azerbaijan which are disputing control of the mountainous 
nagornokarabakh region of azerbaijan 
the population of nagornokarabakh is predominantly armenian and 
is demanding to be united with armenia 
officials of the peoples front organizations of the three 
baltic republics announced that officials from analogous movements 
in armenia and azerbaijan had agreed to travel to latvia for 
possible peace talks 
but the azerbaijanis said they would negotiate only if the 
armenians did not bring up claims to nagornokarabakh 
defense minister dmitri t yazov told soviet journalists on 
friday that the army had moved into baku past barricades of heavily 
armed nationalists to stop a drive to transfer power to the 
peoples front 
he said the soldiers and security forces were intent on rooting 
out a nationalist network from factories and state institutions 
yazov said the soviet military estimates there are 40000 
wellarmed nationalists still loose in the republic 
five hundred buses were back on the road in azerbaijan and the 
restoration of full service was expected soon it said 
in baku some stores were beginning to open although there were 
shortages of supplies and long lines television broadcasts resumed 
for the first time in a week but more than 400 enterprises were at 
a standstill reports said

construction work that goes on even at night at a 
federal prison southwest of miami has sparked rumors that manuel 
noriega will be moved there from his courthouse basement quarters 
lawyers visiting clients at the suburban metropolitan 
correctional center said they have seen work being done under 
floodlights and two windows have been filled with cinder blocks in 
an interview room 
a prison official who spoke on condition of anonymity said a 
holding area intended for noriega has been under construction was 
being painted saturday and could be ready for his transfer as early 
as sunday 
but angel montalvo a prison duty officer said the construction 
was routine and part of ongoing expansion at the 280acre facility 
which houses about 1200 prisoners 
federal prisoners held for trial in miami normally are held at 
the fenced center run by the us bureau of prisons but the 
deposed panamanian leader has been confined in a courthouse 
apartment since he was flown from panama jan 4 
the us marshals service which holds responsibility for 
noriega in the courthouse and federal prison officials refuse as a 
matter of policy to publicly discuss any prisoner moves 
defense attorneys have been assured ready access to their 
highprofile client but they are barred from divulging any 
confidential matters in the case such as preparations for a move 
noriega dressed in his generals uniform appeared before us 
district judge william hoeveler on friday claiming he was a 
prisoner of war illegally captured in the us invasion of panama 
the legal argument is given little chance of success because 
courts have consistently upheld the governments right to prosecute 
foreign defendants once they are in this country no matter how 
they were brought to the jurisdiction the doctrine outlined in 
1856 was based on a capture by a bounty hunter in peru 
in another development two codefendants named with noriega in 
a february 1988 drug indictment planned monday to renew their bids 
for release on bond before hoeveler 
the government is appealing a 1 million bond set for accused 
drugmoney pilot daniel miranda who had a bondsman on hand to 
obtain his release at a hearing jan 12 miranda remained in 
custody when the prosecution appealed 
in the other case an attorney representing luis del cid a 
former noriega aide accused of money laundering will argue that 
the government has confused him with a different man named mario 
del cid 
luis del cid appears in a photograph with noriega and cuban 
president fidel castro in havana but his attorney samuel burstyn 
argues the government knows del cid never took part in any 
conferences in which castro purportedly acted as a mediator in 
talks between noriega and colombian cocaine cartel leaders

would welcome international supervision to ensure fairness in the 
countrys first free elections

a member of one of the noncommunist parties in premier hans 
modrows coalition government 
even if all precautions are taken for free and fair elections 
an additional safeguard cannot hurt neues deutschland said

arrested a week after his expulsion from the communist party

president bush hoping to derail support for a 
social security tax cut will offer as an alternative a proposal to 
use the growing social security surpluses to reduce the national 
debt administration officials said saturday 
the officials said the administration would spell out the 
workings of the proposal as part of bushs 1991 budget which will 
be released monday 
according to the officials who spoke on condition that their 
names not be used the debt reduction would work in the following 
way 
the budget will call for creation of a social security 
integrity and debt reduction fund to be administered by the 
treasury department 
the money for the fund would come from revenues collected by the 
government beginning in 1993 the year the administration projects 
the budget will finally enjoy a small surplus of 57 billion 
the bush proposal would call for the fund to receive an amount 
equal to 15 percent of the surplus that year in the social security 
trust fund the contribution would rise to 50 percent of the social 
security trust fund surplus in 1994 to 85 percent in 1995 and 
finally 100 percent from 1996 through the year 2000 
the congressional budget office estimates that the social 
security surplus the amount collected in payroll taxes above what 
is paid out in benefits will total 98 billion in 1993 rising to 
112 billion in 1994 and 128 billion in 1995 
the portion of the surplus funds flowing into the debt reduction 
account would be used to reduce the federal debt which now stands 
at 28 trillion 
by reducing the debt budget director richard g darman writes 
in a budget overview to be released monday policymakers would be 
leaving a more manageable financing burden for future 
generations 
the federal debt is the sum of all of the annual deficits since 
the government has not had a surplus for 30 years the treasury 
must add to the national debt by borrowing more each year 
the administrations plan assumes that the deficit reduction 
targets spelled out in the grammrudman law will be met and the 
government will start running surpluses in 1993 
however former president reagan also forecast surpluses in 
future years only to see those assumptions fail to occur because of 
slower economic growth and the unwillingness of congress to go 
along with his recommended cuts in domestic programs 
the administrations proposal for dealing with the social 
security surpluses is a recognition of the growing support for a 
proposal by sen daniel moynihan dny to reduce the social 
security tax paid by workers and their employers by 62 billion 
over the next two years 
moynihan wants to cut this years 765 percent social security 
payroll tax back to last years 751 percent rate and also cancel a 
further increase scheduled for next year 
bush has called the moynihan proposal a charade that could 
lead to an eventual reduction in social security benefits or force 
a general tax increase something the president has vowed to oppose 
moynihan has argued that the social security payroll tax should 
be reduced since the growing surpluses in the social security tax 
were not being saved to pay for the retirement of the baby boom 
generation but were instead being used to mask the governments 
real budget deficit

central beijing 
the national television news saturday evening showed each of 
them shaking hands making jokes and hugging babies in a 
campaignstumping style that has become common here only in the 
past few years 
the official term for such visits to homes and factories is 
going to the grass roots and it is an axiom of maoist 
communism that uniting with the masses is the only way to stay 
in power 
the leaders schedules were planned to include visits with 
peasants workers and soldiers the three red or 
revolutionary classes 
in tiananmen square li saluted men of the peoples armed

recent years and shook hands with shanghai officials with a fixed 
smile on his face 
deng customarily spends the lunar new year in shanghai 
officials in beijing gathered at the great hall of the people 
for a party at which li gave a speech reaffirming the governments 
determination to continue its drastic austerity policy 
sharp reductions in credit and construction have slowed 
inflation but also have forced the closure of millions of rural 
factories urban factories remain open but in many the workers sit 
around playing cards and drinking tea because they lack electricity 
or raw materials 
li pledged the governments unremitting efforts to educate 
chinese in patriotism collectivism socialism selfreliance and 
hard struggle 
the year 1989 was an unusual year he said the chinese 
people withstood a severe test and achieved a great victory in 
quelling the antigovernment rebellion in beijing last june he 
was referring to the massive prodemocracy demonstrations that were 
crushed by the army leaving hundreds and possible thousands dead 
we believe that the progressive cause of socialism has a 
bright future in spite of twists and turns along its advance he 
said 
li condemned what he called a trend in taiwan toward seeking 
independence from the mainland the island province has been 
isolated from the mainland since 1949 under rule of the rival 
nationalists but both sides have always regarded it as part of 
china 
we will not sit idly by and will not keep silent if taiwan 
works for independence li warned

vice president dan quayle said 
saturday after meeting with latin heads of state that the us 
invasion of panama has created no sour note in uslatin 
relations despite their earlier comments deploring the military 
action 
quayle said however that the heads of state with whom he met 
did voice concerns and made it clear they want to see us invasion 
troops withdrawn from panama 
yes it will help when were able to reduce our troops 
quayle told reporters after a lunch with the presidents of costa 
rica venezuela guatemala honduras el salvador and the prime 
minister of belize that will be a positive contribution toward 
the building of democracy in panama 
did they express concern certainly concern was expressed 
quayle acknowledged but he and his aides reported an upbeat 
atmosphere nonetheless 
quayle had said earlier in the day that the additional troops 
would be withdrawn in a matter of weeks not months 
a senior administration official traveling with quayle said that 
the sense was many latin countries would not recognize the 
usinstalled government of president guillermo endara in panama 
until the troop levels are down from the current 17000 to the 
preinvasion force of some 13000 at the invasion there were a 
total of 27000 us troops 
however the official insisted there was no resentment 
expressed at the luncheon at the home of newly inaugurated honduran 
president rafael callejas 
panama was the dog that didnt bark the official claimed 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
quayle was sent by president bush to explain the invasion 
rationale to the regional leaders most of whom expressed dismay at 
the invasion of panamas sovereignty in the dec 20 military action 
i am convinced that this decision by the president will 
not be any type of sour note and we will be able to continue with 
the good relations we have had quayle told reporters there is 
no strain in the relationship 
quayle talked at some length privately with callejas about 
economic issues aides said and also for about 25 minutes with 
costa rican president oscar arias about the upcoming presidential 
election in neighboring nicaragua 
he later held a lengthy session with venezuelan president carlos 
andres perez whose government was among the most offended by the 
invasion of panama 
a senior official traveling with quayle subsequently 
characterized perez position as he regretted the us had to 
take this action however it was done 
venezuela was among the countries that signaled to quayle that 
resentment against the invasion was so intense that it would not be 
opportune for him to visit there now 
the official in the quayle party said perez explained that a 
quayle visit would be an excuse for the left to stage 
antiamerican demonstrations 
however the official said perez said he would welcome a visit 
by quayle soon and that it would be a very positive situation 
when the additional us troops are out of panama 
it is necessary for the united states to withdraw its troops 
from panama as soon as possible arias said at a news conference 
it is also necessary for the us and latin america to undertake 
a joint effort as soon as possible to help in the total 
reconstruction of panama 
the leaders were in honduras for the inauguration of callejas 
quayle speaking briefly to reporters after the breakfast at the 
home of ambassador chris arcos acknowledged the panama invasion 
was not without controversy 
we have certainly read the public pronouncements today and 
tomorrow and monday my mission will be private consultations not 
in the nature of apologizing but in the nature of where do we go 
from here how can we work together to build democracy 
as to the 17000 troops remaining in panama down from about 
27000 at the height of the invasion quayle said he would tell the 
latin leaders bush is committed to reducing the level to the 13000 
preinvasion strength 
he would not give a timetable but said it was a time period of 
weeks rather than months we are moving in a downward direction 
before the inauguration quayle met with el salvadors president 
alfredo cristiani in a session that focused mostly on human rights 
and the need to move expeditiously to prosecute military officers 
charged in the nov 16 slaying of six salvadoran jesuit priests 
quayle was applauded and cheered where he entered the outdoor 
stadium where the inaugural ceremony was held he later commented 
i was impressed by the enthusiastic response president callejas 
got during his lengthy inaugural speech 
following the ceremony quayle met with the presidents of 
venezuela costa rica guatemala and belize in addition to 
callejas 
they attended a luncheon hosted by callejas that included a 
minister of nicaragua miguel descoto nicaraguas president 
daniel ortega did not attend the inauguration of his neighbor 
as quayle arrived at callejas home he told a handful of 
onlookers that it was a great day for democracy 
at lunch quayle planned to discuss bushs rationale for the 
panama invasion his aides said 
quayle and his party which included sen richard lugar rind 
and rep gv sonny montgomery dmiss strongly urged 
cristiani to keep pressing on that case said one official in the 
quayle party 
they impressed on him the high level of interest in congress 
where the jesuits case revived rumblings about cutting the 15 
millionperday us aid to el salvador 
talking briefly with reporters quayle said cristiani had 
assured him of his steadfast conviction to seeing justice in 
the case he praised cristiani for doing the right thing in 
arresting four officers and four soldiers in the killings 
cristiani assured quayle and his party that he will pursue 
this investigation to its conclusion the vice president said 
cristiani said we are very well on our way in the 
investigation 
testimony by the soldiers has pointed to col guillermo alfredo 
benavides who is charged in killings as the one who gave the 
orders 
if they come to trial it will be the first trial of officers in 
connection with a human rights case in el salvador 
quayle aides said the vice president also was prepared to 
discuss concerns by the small countries of the region who stand to 
see their us aid packages cut even as bush puts forward a 1 
billion plan to help panama recover from the invasion 
in honduras the united states withheld some 70 million in 1989 
aid because outgoing president jose azcona did not implement 
promised economic reforms 
callejas leader of the national party succeeds azcona after 
winning the election last november it was the second time callejas 
was the top vote getter in a presidential contest the other was in 
1985 when he was prevented from victory by election rules that 
allowed azcona to take office 
callejas has promised to implement economic reforms that the 
united states has been pushing 
also of concern to the bush administration is how the new 
government will deal with the nicaraguan contra rebels encamped 
along the honduran border azcona periodically has demanded the 
usbacked rebels be removed from honduran territory but us 
officials have urged honduras not to boot them out 
traveling with quayle for all or part of his threeday trip to 
panama saturday night and jamaica on monday are lugar montgomery 
republican political consultant mitch daniels assistant secretary 
of state bernard aronson as well as quayles staff

for six months jeff yoder and deborah 
werksman have been hunting quayle in the newspapers and are 
displaying their catch in a new publication devoted exclusively to 
the vice president 
the quayle quarterly went out in the mail last week to its first 
500 subscribers offering a generous mix of satirical and serious 
news about the man whos a heartbeat away from the presidency 
articles include the quayle trail a sampling of quayles 
verbal gaffes travel tips for number twos and here but 
still forgotten along with a quiz cartoons and letters 
theres an advertisement for a dan quayle doormat and a list of 
quayle statistics like the number of house small business 
committee meetings he missed in one session 10 of 14 
subscriptions have been sold so far to citizens political 
consultants and the democratic national committee no senators and 
congressmen have signed on but i think a lot of their aides 
did said werksman 31 
she runs the desktop operation with her husband from his 
bridgeport home they have a commuter marriage and werksman lives 
in new york city both are registered democrats and did not vote 
for quayle and his running mate 
that quayle is vice president means hes grooming for the 
presidency hes being groomed and the american public is being 
groomed to accept him werksman said 
americans have a short memory and we would just like to keep 
the focus we dont want it to just happen and everybody turn 
around and say how did this happen she said 
yoder 35 got the idea for the quayle quarterly while driving 
to his job at a stamford computer software firm 
he heard on the radio this was back in september that 
william bennett was being named drug czar and it registered in his 
mind that that was a job bush mentioned as quayles job all through 
the election werksman said 
he wondered well what is quayles job and he thought others 
were probably wondering as well she said 
werksman and yoder figure theyll have to sell 2000 
subscriptions to break even four issues cost 12 
is quayle a subscriber 
we sent him a complimentary copy of the first issue we only 
sent it yesterday bulk mail werksman said with a laugh on 
tuesday in fact we debated whether we should make him buy it 
quayles spokesman dave beckwith said he has yet to see a 
copy but knew it was coming because his office answered questions 
from the publishers 
im not exactly sure who they are but we tried to answer 
their questions as well as we could he said it seems to be a 
mixture of fun which i have no objection to as long as theyre 
fair about it and serious scholarly work

the same day gubernatorial candidate john silber 
found himself defending remarks viewed as racist he caused further 
controversy with his comments on alcohol abuse 
you can live with alcohol abuse and still achieve at a high 
level said silber speaking to a group of milton high school 
teachers friday 
silber who is on leave as president of boston university 
described a former boss who drank a pint of whiskey or enough 
until he put himself to sleep every night but awoke to function 
fully 
several teachers criticized his remarks which came in response 
to a question about what the faculty should do about increased 
drinking by students 
silber said alcoholics do not burden society in the same way as 
drug addicts and should not be lumped together with them 
he is downplaying the ramifications of alcoholism said mary 
cobb president of the teachers union the horror and 
destruction alcoholism causes may not be as flashy but they can be 
just as devastating as drug abuse 
michal regunberg a silber spokeswoman said saturday the 
democratic candidates remarks were not controversial and stressed 
that he did not discount the dangers posed by those who drive after 
drinking alcohol 
i think what he was saying is that in comparison with the 
scourge of drugs you cant compare the two alcohol whether we 
like it or not has been a part of society for a long time she 
said 
silbers remarks friday came during a day when he had to defend 
himself in the face of charges that he had made racist remarks 
about welfare in massachusetts in a published interview he had 
questioned whether the state has become a welfare magnet 
i think anyone who raised the suggestion that i was either 
hostile to immigrants or in any sense a racist definitely owes me 
an apology silber said friday adding that his father was a 
german immigrant 
gov michael s dukakis who is not seeking reelection called 
silbers comments about immigrants to the state offensive and 
pressed him to apologize

of the amazon jungle home to thousands of species of plants and 
animals and a major source of earths oxygen 
archie carr blamed the brazilian government saying it 
complained about efforts to protect its rain forest instead of 
cooperating to save the jungle the worlds largest wilderness 
he spoke to the associated press at a congress on conservation 
at this field research station 70 miles west of caracas the 
capital 
us and latin american field biologists and educators have 
gathered in the rain forest to discuss ways to instill a 
conservation ethic in young people 
most us participants said they were surprised at how much 
conservation was taught in a school they visited in the catia slums 
of west caracas and how much grassroots support for conservation 
exists in the region 
many of us were not even aware of our own prejudices said 
ann berkovits director of teaching programs at the bronx zoo in 
new york city 
the first panamerican congress on conservation of wildlife 
through education is sponsored by the new york zoological society 
through its field research wing wildlife conservation 
international 
carr is regional coordinator of the societys field programs in 
mexico and the caribbean 
brazilians say their struggling economy benefits from 
development work in the amazon 
president fernando collor de mello told a news conference friday 
in washington where he was visiting president bush that his 
government is aware of environmental concerns but he said any 
actions brazil decides to take will be because the government 
believes it is in the best interests of brazil not because of 
outside pressure 
carr said in the interview at the present time i see no 
reason not to foresee an amazon basin that is totally deforested 
populated from end to end and the scene of a whole host of 
environmental problems that would constitute a planetary disaster 
of historical dimensions 
he said brazils recent efforts to overturn legislation giving 
tax breaks to settlers clearing the land were not enough to save 
the immense region almost as large as the continental us 
the only thing thats saving the amazon at present is its 
magnitude he said 
carr said brazil in the mid1970s instituted a tax program to 
encourage slum dwellers in major cities to emigrate to the scarcely 
populated northern and western amazonian states but that the soil 
there is not able to support agriculture and settlers were left 
worse off than before 
thats what galls conservationists if were going to help 
poor people lets help poor people not try to solve a momentary 
crisis by invading nature he said 
i just wont accept that saving the amazon basin is an 
imperialistic solution the urge to conserve the environment is a 
universal need and it is growing carr said 
he was answering criticism that industrialized nations are 
hypocritical in urging the amazon nations of brazil venezuela 
ecuador colombia and peru to conserve the jungle instead of 
cleaning up their own backyards 
the five countries recently formed an amazonian nation pact to 
study the littleknown region and come up with solutions to save 
its resources 
but carr warned that because of a delicate environmental balance 
in the amazon tampering with the region could lead to severe 
flooding and droughts that would change the entire planets weather 
patterns 
he said creating a national park would not solve the problems 
facing the amazon basin because of the sheer vastness of the 
region 
scientists say destruction of the rain forest adds to the 
greenhouse effect which traps the suns rays and causes global 
warming 
the brazilian government says only 5 percent of its rain forest 
has been destroyed the world bank however says 12 percent has 
been cut and burned

quaker oats co is using fullpage newspaper ads 
to sprinkle some salt on the credibility of a recent medical study 
that found oat bran supplies no special cholesterollowering effect 
the cereal manufacturer has bought fullpage ads in seven major 
newspapers nationwide to cite 10 previous studies supporting its 
claim that eating oat bran helps reduce bloodcholesterol levels 
and the risk of heart attack 
the plain blackandwhite ads published friday in some papers 
list the studies individually by author title publication and 
date 
quaker oat bran can help reduce cholesterol look at 27 years 
of research say the ads which ask consumers who want details on 
the research to write to the chicagobased company 
the ads were bought in usa today the wall street journal the 
new york times the washington post the boston globe the chicago 
tribune and the los angeles times 
quaker holds about 70 percent of the oat bran cereal market its 
sales of oat bran original hot cereal went from 1 million pounds in 
all of 1987 to 2 million pounds per month in 1989 
in all 218 new oat bran products were introduced last year 
alone according to gormans new product news an industry 
newsletter 
but some analysts predict the oatbran boom will go bust or at 
least be deflated because of a harvard study published last week 
saying oat bran has no special cholesterollowering properties 
the study which appeared in the new england journal of 
medicine said the apparent cholesterolreducing benefits of eating 
oat bran resulted from its replacement of fatty foods in peoples 
diets not from a special property of the grain itself 
other cereals work just as well to reduce arteryclogging excess 
cholesterol in the bloodstream said the authors 
kellogg co another major cereal manufacturer that makes oat 
products such as common sense oat bran cereal has no plans to 
change our marketing strategy and no plans to change our 
advertising spokeswoman nancy roach said from the companys 
headquarters in battle creek mich 
quaker spokesman ron bottrell said his company has no plans to 
run additional ads or to change its marketing or advertising for 
quaker oat bran hot cereal oat bran cold cereal or oatmeal 
products 
the company has research findings indicating the harvard study 
hasnt swayed people away from using oat bran but we wanted to 
reinforce with those customers the fact that a large body of 
research existed bottrell said 
bonnie liebman director of nutrition for the washingtonbased 
consumer group center for science in the public interest agreed 
scientists are used to having studies with opposite results 
and they know that over time the truth emerges ms liebman 
said consumers have only recently accepted science and health as 
news and they arent used to that

the communist partys plan to dissolve 
itself and form a single new party with broader appeal was 
threatened saturday when a group of renegade members accused the 
leadership of making only cosmetic changes 
the communist party opened its final congress saturday to form a 
new party that it hopes will stand a better chance of winning power 
in an increasingly democratic poland 
after heated debate most delegates voted to suspend the congress 
of the polish united workers party the partys formal name and 
immediately open the founding congress of the new stillunnamed 
party 
but a leading progressive tadeusz fiszbach and about 100 
others refused to join saying no authentic reform had emerged and 
that the new party must shed part of its old conservative 
membership to draw support 
its not our goal to break up the party but we all are not 
going the same way fiszbach told about 200 delegates at a 
meeting early sunday after the congress recessed for the night 
fiszbach a communist parliamentary leader with backing from 
solidarity leader lech walesa was enlisting supporters for another 
new party to be called the social democratic union of the 
republic of poland 
communist leaders sought to negotiate with fiszbach in hopes of 
avoiding a split 
first secretary mieczyslaw f rakowski opened the threeday 
communist party congress with a surprise announcement that he would 
not try to lead a new party 
during the afternoon riot police clashed with hundreds of 
anticommunist demonstrators saturday outside congress hall no 
arrests or serious injuries were reported 
the agenda of the communist party congress called for dissolving 
the 41yearold party with a resounding condemnation of its 
ideology and endorsement of parliamentary democracy the starting 
work on the new party 
but the more than 1600 delegates voted overwhelmingly to change 
the order by proceeding with forming the new party before 
dissolving the old one 
fear about what would happen to the partys assets was a focal 
point of much of the debate over issues involved in the dissolution 
the legal status of buildings companies car fleets and other 
property amassed by the communist party during its long control is 
under review by a commission established last week the 
solidarityled government is trying to defuse public clamor to 
nationalize the communists holdings 
after the vote suspending the communist party congress 
delegates began signing cards making them founding members of the 
new still unnamed party which is likely to follow the social 
democratic model 
the delegates then quickly approved a 44member presidium for 
the new party and bylaws that had been prepared in advance 
but fiszbachs absence became public when his seat on a 
committee had to be reassigned 
he wanted immediate dissolution of the communist party and his 
backers said unless there was evidence of deep reform people would 
not believe a truly new party had been formed 
i havent seen manipulation of such a kind for a very very 
long time said communist parliament deputy wlodzimierz 
cimoszewicz 
mr rakowski should get a prize as the best magician of the 
year in one speech he turned communists into social democrats 
everything going on in that room is too good to be true 
rakowski and other leaders hope the new party will become the 
main leftwing party in polands widening democratic political 
spectrum 
the communist party ceded governing power to the solidarity 
movement after disastrous defeat last year in the freest elections 
here since world war ii 
poland since has plunged into economic reforms aimed at swiftly 
converting the system to free enterprise 
the nations communist party would become the second in the east 
bloc to reconstitute itself the hungarian socialist workers party 
transformed itself into the hungarian socialist party in october 
as delegates met more than 500 demonstrators from 
anticommunist groups gathered outside chanting communists must 
go they burned a red flag 
riot police moved in to push them away with a few police using 
truncheons one demonstrator was seen with a bloodied face 
the police moved the protesters a block away where 
demonstrators continued to hurl stones bottles firecrackers and a 
few gasoline bombs 
the delegates gathered in warsaws imposing stalinistera palace 
of culture and science where rakowski opened the meeting with a 
speech reviewing the partys past and discussing the future 
in announcing he would not seek a leadership role in a new 
party rakowski 65 said i consider it appropriate to pass over 
the helm to a new generation the delegates responded with a 
standing ovation 
rakowski appealed to the delegates whose opinions range from 
orthodox communism to extreme liberalism not to split into more 
than one party 
if we want to exist as a real force in the polish political 
scene we should not leave the congress hall through different 
exits he said 
rakowski said he had struggled to reform the party since the 
stalinist era ended in 1956 but failed because many members clung 
to stalinist ideas and the soviet union continued to interfere with 
polish reforms until the rise of mikhail s gorbachev in 1985 
referring to the past he said its true that we deserved a 
good whipping 
the party now claims 19 million members but the one that 
emerges after the congress will be much smaller politburo member 
janusz reykowski predicted in an interview 
walesa and the communist partys delegation in parliament have 
supported fiszbach to lead the new party fiszbach is a former 
gdansk party chief ousted from official positions in the 1980s 
because he opposed the 1981 imposition of martial law 
possible candidates include aleksander kwasniewski 35 now in 
charge of national sports and recreation or leszek miller 43 a 
party secretary and rakowski loyalist 
another potential candidate slawomir wiatr 37 founder of a 
liberal party faction on saturday announced his support for 
kwasniewski to be leader 
the communist party was founded in 1948 in a merger forced by 
soviet dictator josef stalin of the small communist polish workers 
party and the polish socialist party a leftwing party dating from 
the 19th century that enjoyed broad popular support 
now the party says it wants to give up the communist part of 
that heritage and become a social democratic group building on the 
old socialist tradition

the sunday correspondent newspaper quoting 
unidentified senior proiranian shiite moslem sources reported 
sunday that western hostages held in lebanon are alive 
the report said sources in hezbollah a shiite fundamentalist 
faction had confirmed that the hostages numbering 17 according to 
the newspapers information are fit and well 
the newspaper reported the hostages are kept in small groups and 
moved regularly from one safe house to another in west beiruts 
suburbs 
the frontpage story quoted a conversation heard by londonbased 
reporter hala jaber at a wake she attended recently in beirut of a 
hezbollah member killed in south lebanon 
the lebaneseborn journalist said she heard a wellknown 
hezbollah member tell her unidentified contact he had guarded 
hostages john mccarthy and thomas sutherland in the basement of a 
house in the southern suburbs of west beirut 
the paper quoted the hezbollah member as saying the guards had 
instructions to keep the hostages healthy 
most western hostages in lebanon are believed to be held by 
factions of hezbollah or party of god that receives considerable 
financial support from iran 
hezbollah works closely with units of the iranian revolutionary 
guards stationed in lebanon since israels 1982 invasion to build 
influence among the countrys 12 million shiites lebanons 
largest sect 
the longest held hostage is terry anderson 42 chief middle 
east correspondent of the associated press who was kidnapped on 
march 16 1985 
mccarthy 33 a british television journalist was kidnapped 
april 17 1986 as he drove to beirut airport to flee the country 
scottishborn us citizen sutherland 57 the acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university in beirut was abducted june 
9 1985 
this was not the usual beirut talk rumor mingled with 
speculation masquerading as fact ms jaber wrote about the 
conversation at the wake 
these were two friends talking privately after a funeral in 
the heartland of hezbollah nor did it seem likely that hezbollah 
was deliberately leaking information they could do that far more 
effectively by sending a photograph or a videotape of the hostages 
to a western news agency or a local newspaper 
the sunday correspondent said the conversation was confirmed by 
a senior unidentified member of hezbollahs security network who 
said mccarthy and sutherland were held together 
they are in the same cell all the other hostages are alive 
and well the newspaper quoted the source as saying they are 
not held in the same place for security reasons they have been 
split into small groups in various parts of the suburbs 
jill morrell the tv journalist who has campaigned for 
mccarthys release said the report matched information she had 
received from french hostage paul kauffmann released in spring 
1988 the sunday correspondent reported 
it is the most encouraging news we have had for a long time 
there have been so many stories but this one sounds as if makes 
sense the sunday correspondent quoted miss morrell as saying 
the newspaper quoted british government sources as saying the 
report was interesting and possible 
the foreign office had no comment 
in its total of 17 western hostages the sunday correspondent 
did not include alec collett 67 a british new yorkbased writer 
who was on assignment for the un relief and works agency when he 
was kidnapped on march 25 1985 
the revolutionary organization of socialist moslems said it 
kidnapped and killed collett a video was released purporting to 
show his body hanging from a scaffold no body was found

hotel workers struck binions horseshoe club on 
saturday with hundreds of angry pickets chanting slogans and 
taunting tourists who entered the hotel and casino 
come on out losers one picket yelled at tourists entering 
the casino shame on you you slimy scabs we dont need you 
here 
about 300 pickets fanned out at entrances to the hotelcasino 
which covers a square block in the heart of the citys downtown 
glitter gulch the casino is the first to be struck since union 
contracts expired june 1 
later saturday organizers said about 2000 people showed up at 
a rally in front of the hotel police put the crowd estimate at 500 
dozens of police were stationed throughout the area and security 
guards blocked each entrance of the casino allowing gamblers in 
and keeping strikers out there were no arrests 
about 1000 kitchen workers bartenders porters and other 
workers were expected to join in the strike at the horseshoe which 
has long been one of the desert resort citys most popular downtown 
hotelcasinos 
the strike is the first by the 28000member culinary union 
since 1984 when its citywide walkout paralyzed many major las 
vegas resorts and cost millions of dollars in lost revenues 
the horseshoe is one of 14 resorts that have not reached new 
pacts with the union but 20 resorts including most major casinos 
along the strip a couple of miles from downtown agreed several 
months ago to new fiveyear pacts 
inside the casino was crowded with gamblers but some tables 
and gaming machines were empty the hotels coffee shop was closed 
but a buffet remained open security guards kept an eye on pickets 
and several police cars were stationed around the block 
culinary union local 226 secretarytreasurer jim arnold said 80 
percent of the workers left their jobs when the strike mainly over 
wages and benefits began at 5 am saturday 
he said the union had been trying to avoid strikes at major 
resorts since the union contract expired we didnt want any 
problems arnold said the last thing we wanted to create was 
another 1984 
he said the strike date was moved up following thursdays 59070 
strike authorization vote because of alleged harassment of union 
workers by hotel officials 
horseshoe president jack binion who did not return phone calls 
for comment has said he plans to replace union workers with new 
employees and keep the hotelcasino operating most casino workers 
do not belong to unions 
arnold said horseshoe negotiators and the unions were far apart 
in talks that ended in december and that the hotel refused a union 
request earlier in the week to resume negotiations 
arnold predicted the strike would cut heavily into horseshoe 
business which he said included many local residents who would 
refuse to cross the picket lines 
he said the resort also will find it hard to hire replacement 
workers at a time the las vegas economy is expanding and hotel 
workers are at a premium 
many pickets would probably begin looking for other jobs while 
picketing and receiving 150 a week in strike benefits arnold said

that his wife donna be dismissed as a defendant 
the elder macdonalds lawyer joe keilp argued that the tribe 
has fought for its sovereign rights for years but now is risking 
them by allowing its chairman to be sued in state court 
the tribes lawyer phillip weeks said the case was filed in a 
state court because it involves both indians and nonindians and 
relates to acts that occurred both on and off the navajo 
reservation 
the lawsuit claims the navajo nation was defrauded by macdonald 
in a multimilliondollar land deal and seeks to overturn the 
tribes 1987 purchase of the 491000acre boquillas ranch in 
northern arizona 
on thursday navajo district judge robert yazzie granted a 
prosecution request to delay a hearing set for monday for macdonald 
sr 
the hearing was scheduled to determine whether there is cause to 
try macdonald on more than 100 criminal counts involving alleged 
corruption in tribal government and in macdonalds 1986 election 
campaign 
yazzie granted the delay because prosecutors said they were 
unable to get all of their subpoenas served on witnesses in time 
for the hearing

thousands of people in the eastern united 
states reported seeing a strange blueishgreen light in the sky 
saturday night which some experts said could have been an unusually 
large meteorite 
we are quite confident it was not a manmade object 
reentering said maj dick adam public affairs officer for the 
north american aerospace defense command norad in colorado 
springs colo we have no idea what it was 
robert gribble of the national ufo reporting center in seattle 
a private group reported receiving dozens of calls 
based on descriptions that have been given id say were 
dealing with a very large solid a very large meteor said 
gribble 
descriptions run from a bluegreen to a bright green coming 
down in an angular descent leaving a short tail behind it said 
gribble he said everyone who had telephoned the center described 
the object as coming down and hitting the ground in their area 
which is very common in something like is 
among the people who reported seeing the object was david 
arnold an area air traffic control supervisor at dulles airport 
where the sighting occurred at 710 pm est 
we dont know exactly what it was a meteor or a satellite 
said arnold who has been an air traffic controller for 25 years 
it lasted 25 to 30 seconds and went from brilliant white to an 
orange as it broke up 
weve seen things like this before but much higher this was 
quite brilliant it appeared to have dissipated completely 
however not all witnesses saw the object change color and 
appear to disappear 
a television reporter in oak hill w va one of the places 
where there was a flurry of initial sightings was at the home of 
one of the first witnesses nearly three hours after the initial 
sighting and reported the light was still hovering in the sky 
kitty harrison assignment editor for woaytv in oak hill 
wva said what she saw was absolutely not a meteorite 
ive seen meteorites before and this doesnt resemble the type 
of meteorite ive seen she told the associated press in a 
telephone interview from the home of elizabeth gray and her son 
chris in stanaford west va 
what we are seeing is a very bright bluish white object that 
appears to be moving downward toward the horizon in an erratic 
spiraling motion harrison told the ap it is very slow you 
have to keep your eye fixed to something stationary in order to see 
its progress 
chris gray 13 was carrying firewood to the house when he saw 
the object 
i saw the sky light up and then i didnt pay no attention to 
it until my brother said he saw the same thing said the 
teenager i was looking in the binoculars and i saw this 
purplish football with rings around it and it was going around in 
circles and stuff 
i saw the sky light up for the meteorite and then about half 
an hour later i saw what ill call a ufo and then when the 
television station called me back they told me to tape it on my cam 
corder and while we were taping it was changing colors and it 
started separating and going back together said chris gray 
among the witnesses in the washington area was andrew guthrie a 
news editor at the voice of america since 1983 
it was a dramatic thing to see said guthrie i almost 
drove off the road he said the object appeared to be 
threeorfour times treetop level and about the size of a 
grapefruit with an incandescent bright light at the center like a 
magnesium flare 
an ap reporter walking along pennsylvania avenue in the foggy 
bottom section of washington recalled thinking initially that it 
was some type manmade firework similar to flares shot into the sky 
on the fourth of july because it was very bright and distinct 
appeared to be moving across the sky at about the same speed 
typical of such displays seemed to have a tail and appeared to be 
low enough to have been shot from the balcony of one of the 
multistory apartment buildings in the area 
however the light remained on a flat trajectory moving rapidly 
across the sky without fading in intensity of falling 
the witness then surmised that it could have been a fogshrouded 
light on a fastmoving helicopter until realizing the night was 
clear and that the telltell chopper sound of a helicopter so 
near was absent 
a photographer driving in the same area at the time reported 
similar observations but also saw the object appear to change 
color and break up it looked like it was really chose he 
said it looked like it was really there 
sightings were reported from an area ranging from west virginia 
and along the eastern seaboard from virginia to new york 
norads adam said the air force was getting calls from all of 
those areas 
we cannot correlate the sighting with any of the information 
of the objects we are tracking in space said adam we are 
tracking approximately 6800 objects our mission is to keep track 
of whats in space whatever it was it wasnt one of the objects 
were tracking

defense attorneys for a man cleared in the 
shootings of carol and charles stuart have criticized a prosecutor 
for fostering an impression their client is still somehow linked to 
the crime 
suffolk county district attorney newman flanagan has stated 
publicly that william bennett is no longer a suspect but an 
appellate court brief opposing the release of police videotapes of 
stuart picking bennett out of a police lineup suggested a link 
might still be under investigation the boston herald reported 
saturday 
the prosecutors brief stated that the tapes should be impounded 
because the man reportedly identified in the lineup may yet turn 
out to have some connection with the case 
bennett was placed in the lineup after he was arrested on an 
unrelated charge 
as far as im concerned any attempt to try to indict bennett 
in this case would be an attempt to cover up the blame for their 
botched investigation said bennetts attorney robert george 
stuart told police that a black mugger shot him and fatally 
wounded his pregant wife oct 23 after they left a childbirthing 
class at a boston hospital ten weeks after the shooting stuart 
apparently committed suicide after one of his brothers implicated 
him in the shootings 
the herald quoted police sources as saying that investigators 
will not concede that bennetts remarkable resemblance to the 
description stuart gave of his attacker is a coincidence

after eight hours and 2500 miles avianca 
flight 52 fell from the sky but not apparently because of wind 
shear sabotage a collision or any other violent exotic or 
complicated peril of modern aviation 
it may simply have run out of gas 
fuel exhaustion as the experts call it rarely causes airline 
crashes but investigators were trying to determine if that was 
really what sent flight 52 into the long island woods thursday 
night killing 73 passengers and crew members and injuring the 86 
others 
here insofar as it can be determined is what happened 
flight 52 a boeing 707 left el dorado international airport in 
bogota capital city of colombia at 130 pm est after a stop in 
medellin capital city of the cocaine trade the plane headed for 
new york 
the plane according to colombian radio reports had been having 
maintenance problems over the past four months it had been hauled 
back into the shop for repairs 37 times 
it also was heading into rough weather a slowmoving front was 
dumping rain all along the east coast grounding many planes but 
flight 52 was already on its way and its passengers enjoyed a meal 
of chicken and rice and a film starring sean connery 
the travelers included young blanca and pedro beltron who were 
traveling with their newly adoptive father to a new home in 
suburban new jersey a 30yearold man with more than a dozen 
golfball sized packets of cocaine hidden inside his bowels and 
jorge lozano a grayhaired bogota resident working for american 
cargill a large grain company he had made this flight many times 
before 
the plane was scheduled to land at kennedy international airport 
at 8 pm but air traffic was backed up all along the east coast 
and controllers forced flight 52 to wait en route for about 75 
minutes then as the plane neared new york the passengers were 
told that because of congestion there would be an additional wait 
before landing at least 45 minutes before the crash the crew told 
air traffic controllers that they were low on fuel 
as the plane circled overhead a woman waited at the gate at 
kennedy barely able to contain herself 
aleta heidt carried two small parkas blue and purple for the 
two orphans who had become her children she knew blanca 12 and 
pedro 10 only from pictures but she loved them and she was 
looking forward to seeing her husband again 
at around 920 pm in rain fog and low clouds the pilot 
prepared to land on runaway 22 left visibility was less than a 
half mile 
suddenly the plane was dropping too fast and at the wrong 
angle pull up pull up intoned the recorded voice of the 
planes automatic warning device glide slope glide slope 
looking out the window lozano could easily recognize the 
highways below then with no explanation from the cockpit the 
plane rose and banked it was 924 
the pilot told the tower the 707 was low on fuel running out of 
it 
the tower asked the pilot if he wanted to try another approach 
yes he said but were running out of fuel the tower gave him a 
flight pattern and asked if it was ok ok the captain responded 
the words fuel emergency which might have produced a 
speedier landing plan were never spoken 
the plane swung east out over the atlantic and then north across 
long island part of a great circle that would bring it back to 
kennedy but this maneuver also consumed vast amounts of precious 
fuel at 932 the pilot had more bad news two engines were out 
that was the last the tower heard from flight 52 at 934 it lost 
contact 
in the cockpit the voice recorder stopped the plane began to 
shake the lights inside the cabin went off as did those on the 
wings the only illumination came from emergency lights over the 
doors the passengers were frightened some especially the 
children started to cry or scream 
were descending realized one woman who knew the area but 
theres no airport below 
in the affluent suburban neighborhood below rick robinson a 
53yearold sportswriter was watching the dave thomas comedy 
show on television with his 79yearold mother 
dr bruce rebold a 42yearold physician was talking on the 
telephone with a friend 
jeff race a 26yearold emergency medical technician was 
eating a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and watching television 
in the kitchen of his familys house 
overhead lozano had realized the plane was going to crash the 
shaking was much worse and the craft was dropping fast worst of 
all the engines were silent even though the fuel gauges would 
show that the planes tanks still held 1300 gallons 
there had been no explanation from the crew but lozano thought 
he knew the problem were out of fuel 
he said a prayer and lacking a pillow laid his attache case 
over his knees then he bent over in the crash position and waited 
to die five seconds later the dark silent plane hit the tree 
line 
robinson heard something outside a scraping noise like a 
tree falling or a snowplow dragging along the road 
rebolds house shook when the flue came crashing down the 
chimney he figured it was time to get off the phone i told my 
friend i had to go that something was happening the house was 
falling apart 
race saw the kitchen lights flicker switched on his police 
radio and heard a report of a crash he ran out the door 
forgetting to trade his docksiders for boots 
the 707 mowed a path through the trees some 100 feet tall 
before hitting an embankment the right wing broke off and the 
cockpit was crushed everyone and everything was thrown forward 
those in front died faster and in greater numbers 
the plane had crashed onto a steep wooded slope a few feet from 
the deck of a large modern house the captain was dead or dying 
as were the two other officers in the cockpit 
robinson got a flashlight and went out for a look a wire burst 
into flame showing the outline of the plane he could hear a voice 
crying feebly for help 
inside lozano looked at the wreckage that surrounded him and 
realized he was still alive there was a lot of screaming and 
groaning around me i was hoping people would help this little 
girl she was screaming for her mother please help my mother 
shes stuck under the seat 
rescue workers brought in spotlights to cut through the fog the 
scene reminded robinson of the war of the worlds the martians 
had invaded 
lozano could see the lights too but it might have been 30 
minutes until firemen arrived carried him out of the plane and 
rested him on the ground outside 
i laid there counting my blessings it was a miracle 
race one of the first people to reach the plane found bodies 
on top of bodies on top of bodies he pulled about six children 
and a dozen adults from the wreckage and then set up a triage area 
as reinforcements arrived soon the one access road was jammed with 
vehicles including those of the merely curious some doctors 
nurses and technicians had to walk miles to reach the injured 
there were unforgettable images dozens of bodies covered by 
white plastic sheets lying on the welltended lawn of tennis star 
john mcenroes parents a priest holding an iv bag with one hand 
and administering the churchs last rites with the other a woman 
who had been given up for dead and covered with a sheet stirring 
back to life 
at a hospital a dozen miles away mrs heidt clutched a silver 
crucifix her husband her new son her new daughter were in 
critical condition at three hospitals with a variety of broken 
limbs 
she was asked about her husband who went alone to colombia to 
get the kids because they couldnt both afford to take the time off 
from work 
when hes up and healthy and i see his beautiful brown eyes 
she said then ill feel like talking

investigators confirmed saturday that 
none of the four engines was running when avianca flight 52 crashed 
into a hillside killing 73 of the 149 people on board 
the national transportation safety board had reported earlier 
that three of the four engines werent running the fourth was dug 
out of the mud by workers saturday 
ntsb spokesman lee dickinson also said saturday that the 
jetliners crew expressed concern to air traffic controllers that 
the plane was low on fuel 45 to 50 minutes before it crashed and 
the boeing 707 was kept in holding patterns for nearly 90 minutes 
however it was unclear whether the plane had been put into any 
of three separate holding patterns before or after the crew 
complained of low fuel dickinson said 
the ntsb previously reported that the crew had expressed 
concerns about low fuel just 30 minutes before the crash and that 
the plane had been kept in holding patterns for about 45 minutes 
the revised estimates came after investigators interviewed air 
traffic controllers dickinson said at the news conference at a 
hotel in nearby melville 
earlier in the day dickinson spoke at a briefing at the wooded 
accident site where investigators painstakingly examined the 
wreckage focusing especially on the broken planes fuel tanks 
lines and gauges the 
we did a quick cursory inspection and there was no power on 
these engines when the accident did occur he said 
investigators determined the engines were not rotating because 
debris inside of them had not been chewed up he said fan blades 
in the engine did not show damage that would have indicated a 
working motor he added 
residents in the affluent long island north shore neighborhood 
reported that the plane made no sound until it hit the trees 
thursday night the crew had radioed that it was low on fuel 
shortly before the crash and there was no explosion upon impact 
the absence of an explosion saved lives authorities said most 
of the 86 survivors remained hospitalized saturday at least 29 of 
them in critical condition one person who survived the crash died 
saturday said nassau county police spokesman peter franzone but 
he had no details 
the number of people aboard was revised from 161 to 159 when 
discrepancies were settled among flight lists and patient counts 
dickinson said 
dickinson said it is still unknown how long it was from the time 
the engines lost power to impact 
the plane had aborted its first landing at john f kennedy 
international airport when an automatic warning device in the 
cockpit said it was dropping too fast and at the wrong angle among 
factors under study dickinson said was whether the aborted 
landing affected the planes fuel system 
in bogota a veteran avianca pilot speaking on condition of 
anonymity said that when a 707 is low on fuel a steep climb after 
an aborted landing may force the fuel away from its engines 
causing them to stall 
boeing spokesman tom cole said saturday he did not know if that 
was the case however he said just on the face of it you 
wouldnt design an airplane like that because you have to make 
goaround attempts sometimes or take other avoidance measures 
he said boeing sent three investigators to the crash site 
including a fuel expert 
the new york times quoting inidentified pilots reported in 
sundays editions that fuel gauges on 707s are often imprecise 
unlike newer planes the 707 has no warning lights to indicate that 
the plane is running critically low on fuel the times said that 
the first warning light seen by the flight engineer would have been 
a lowoil pressure light and by then the engine would already 
have begun to flame out 
cole however said that in his 25 years with boeing he had 
never heard of a problem with a fuel gauge on a 707 
only one of the boeing 707s seven fuel tanks was intact 
dickinson said investigators will inspect the tanks to see if any 
fuel remained inside he said 
the ntsb has said that indicators showed the plane had about 
10000 pounds of fuel or nearly 1500 gallons of the 23855 
gallons of fuel a 707 can carry 
two fuel gauges indicated there were between 2300 and 2400 
pounds in at least two tanks but another gauge that measures fuel 
among all seven tanks showed a total of only 1100 to 1200 pounds 
of fuel dickinson said it was not clear if those were accurate 
readings or whether the needles locked into that position on 
impact he said 
one of the things we have not been able to do is physically 
determine how much fuel was in each tank he said 
the flight from bogota and medellin colombia was making its 
second approach to land at kennedy airport when it crashed 15 miles 
away shortly before 945 pm on a rainy foggy night 
because of badweather delays the plane from bogota and 
medellin colombia was put into a holding pattern for 89 minutes 
two times by controllers in norfolk va once for 16 minutes and 
a second time for 27 minutes and finally 46 minutes some 40 miles 
south of kennedy dickinson said 
records were being checked in colombia to see how much fuel was 
loaded in medellin he said 
after aborting its first landing attempt the crew told air 
traffic controllers the plane was low on fuel but the crew did not 
declare a fuel emergency which would have given it landing 
priority ntsb officials said friday 
i remember the plane making all kinds of noises after the 
pilot tried to land at the airport and didnt make it passenger 
gloria restrepo who suffered fractured legs said from her 
hospital bed i was scared because it didnt sound good i knew 
something was wrong then all the lights went out 
the cockpit crew members including capt laureano caviedes 
52 a 28year avianca veteran were killed in the crash 
an avianca spokesman jaime marriaga said he would have no 
comment on the possible cause of the crash until its investigation 
was completed 
the 23yearold plane had been sent to the maintenance shop 37 
times in the past four months the colombian radio network rcn 
reported

the crew of a colombian jetliner was 
worried about running low on fuel just before the plane crashed 
killing 72 people federal investigators say 
national safety board member lee dickinson told a news 
conference friday that the crew on a voice recorder recovered from 
the wreckage expressed concern several times about fuel levels 
after an aborted landing attempt 
but the pilot did not declare an emergency landing priority that 
would have required controllers to immediately clear avianca 
airlines flight 52 for a landing thursday night he said 
although many clues indicate the plane had little or no fuel 
when it crashed into a hill on the north shore of long island 
federal investigators would not say that the crash was caused by 
the plane running out of fuel

manuel noriega must remain in jail despite his 
claim that he is a prisoner of war and should be moved to a neutral 
country a judge ruled 
us district judge william hoevelers decision on friday came 
after prosecutors portrayed the fallen panamanian ruler as a 
wealthy and dangerous man with cash and armed supporters 
potentially hidden around the world 
mr noriega is a danger to the community said deputy 
assistant us attorney myles malman said during the bond hearing 
he is a military man trained and skilled in the use of 
counterterrorism covert actions and weapons 
prosecutors said the 145year sentence noriega could be given if 
convicted of drug trafficking coupled with his extraordinary 
wealth made it likely he would flee the country if released on

the environments importance as an issue shaping 
the business landscape of the 1990s was brought into sharper focus 
when two major oil companies took hefty slices from earnings to pay 
pollution costs 
exxon corp said 500 million was to remedy damage already done 
while chevron corp said 325 million was for future cleaning costs 
at its us refining marketing and chemicals sites 
oil industry experts say the charges announced this past week 
highlighted what is expected to be the biggest single concern 
facing business and the oil industry in particular in the 1990s 
under any scenario were going to be spending more on the 
environment clean air waste management oil spill legislation 
a whole series of things will impact the corporate bottom line as 
never before said terry f yosie vice president for health and 
environment for the american petroleum institute the trade 
association representing major oil companies and refiners 
outside the oil industry environmentalism already has become a 
byword for conducting business 
walmart stores inc for example has become a leader in 
pushing suppliers for more recycled or recyclable products 
mcdonalds corp promotes recycling in advertising while polaroid 
corp is emphasizing waste reduction and consolidated natural gas 
co is focusing on cleanburning technologies 
observers say the environment as a cost in planning organizing 
and setting corporate strategy is the reality of the future 
we should as shareholders and investors become used to 
environmental charges as a semipermanent part of the financial 
landscape for a long time said bernard picchi analyst and a 
managing director for salomon brothers inc 
picchi said that while the words ecology and environment 
scarcely existed in the oil industry lexicon throughout most of its 
150 year history its a fact of reality in late 20th century 
america that citizens government and corporations are becoming 
aware of their environmental responsibility 
exxon has been dangled before the public as an example of a 
company that seemingly failed to recognize that responsibility 
despite spending 2 billion to clean the alaska oil spill exxon 
still has not mended its reputation and remains the target of 
rebuke everywhere from capitol hill to the tonight show 
the march disaster the nations worst oil spill blackened the 
image of the entire industry 
the public in general believes the industrys behavior and 
goals still differ substantially from what they ought to be and i 
think thats an untenable position for an industry to be in 
yosie said 
that is changing sobered by exxons experience other oil 
companies are taking the initiative the environment has become a 
more central component of business strategy and is managed at a 
higher level than before 
in announcing its 355 million charge against fourthquarter 
earnings for anticipated environmentrelated expenses earlier this 
month texaco president james w kinnear said the company is 
committed to its role in safeguarding and maintaining the 
environment in which it operates 
phillips petroleum co exxon and other companies recently 
created new seniorlevel executive positions to bring the issue 
closer to the seat of corporate decisionmaking amoco corp which 
had had a corporatelevel environmentalist for three years 
atlantic richfield co british petroleum co and others are 
changing management structures to deal with growing environmental 
concerns 
furthermore public and regulatory pressure is changing the 
industrys products as the environment becomes a competitive issue 
gasoline and the processes used to make it for example are 
expected to undergo major changes in the 1990s to minimize 
pollution 
still critics contend the oil industry has a long way to go in 
most instances it still reacts to problems instead of preventing 
them which creates the perception of footdragging 
that too is untenable yosie said if that doesnt 
change the industry will lose control of the way it manages its 
business and ceos are acutely aware of that 
in other business news this past week 
the stock and bond markets fell rattled by fears of higher 
worldwide interest rates meanwhile new economic reports raised 
recession fears in this country 
the nations top life insurer prudential insurance company of 
america said it plans to allow terminally ill policyholders and 
those permanently confined to nursing homes to tap into death 
benefits while they are still alive providing them cash to cover 
the enormous cost of dying 
a suspended graduate student faced five years in prison and a 
250000 fine after he was convicted on federal computer tampering 
charges robert t morris was accused of unleashing a worm that 
crippled a nationwide network of thousands of computers

bankruptcycourt refuge from debts incurred in a leveraged buyout 
announced plans to sell 712 of its 1873 stores in a costly

as they pore over charts of the early1990 slide 
in stock prices some wall street analysts say they are starting to 
see the telltale tracks of a potentially nasty bear market 
veterans of the financial forecasting game caution that such 
phenomena are notoriously tricky to identify for sure at least 
until well after they have come and gone 
furthermore the species has grown unfamiliar given that the 
stock market has not experienced a longterm decline since the 
early 1980s 
but with those qualifications many marketwatchers say there 
have been several developments to suggest that a new generation of 
wall streeters might be headed for its first facetoface encounter 
with an oldfashioned bear 
bearishness can build and it can build to an extreme says 
joseph feshbach technical analyst at prudentialbache securities 
a bear markets purpose after all is to purge the extremes of 
the prior bull market 
before it runs its course this bear market will challenge and 
ultimately destroy the longterm case for equities 
those are strong words for a world that has weathered in recent 
times both the crash of 1987 and the big break in stock prices that 
occurred last oct 13 
pessimists point out however that both those declines were as 
short as they were severe and soon gave place to recoveries that 
carried stocks to new highs 
what is more they say the sudden 1987 and 1989 declines could 
be seized upon as an opportunity for bargain hunting in stocks 
where earnings prospects hadnt materially changed 
now many analysts argue stock prices may be falling without 
getting much cheaper because corporate earnings are slumping 
badly too and interest rates are rising at the same time 
rising rates increase yields on interestbearing securities that 
compete with stocks for investors favor and thus reduce the 
relative appeal of stock dividend payouts 
recent price declines have not restored fair value to the 
stock market argues abby joseph cohen strategist at drexel 
burnham lambert in a current market commentary 
corporate profit reports for the fourth quarter of 1989 have 
thus far contained more disappointments than positive surprises 
and consensus expectations for 1990 continue to move lower we 
nonetheless believe that these profit forecasts are still too 
high 
amid such gloomy appraisals the dow jones average of 30 
industrials skidded 11867 points in the past week to a sixmonth 
low of 255923 
the new york stock exchange composite index dropped 735 to 
18021 the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market 
fell 1955 to 42133 and the american stock exchange market value 
index was down 1521 at 35087 
volume on the big board averaged 18119 million shares a day 
against 17226 million the week before 
for a prime example of a modern bear market many analysts cite 
the 45 percent drop in stocks over a span of more than 20 months 
from january 1973 through early december 1974 
in the subsequent recovery it took the dow jones industrial 
average nearly 10 years to surpass its early1973 peaks 
even in that relatively recent era wall street communications 
and orderprocessing systems were primitive by todays standards 
analysts see other reasons as well why a bear market at the 
outset of the 1990s if one is undeed underway need not take so 
long to complete 
for one thing they say markets command greater attention from 
government policymakers these days as a deregulated influence on 
the wellbeing of the country as a whole 
should the economy slump further along with the stock market 
say the economists david a levy and s jay levy in chappaqua 
ny its carnage and the resulting financial crisis would 
command the federal reserves attention ahead of all other 
concerns
