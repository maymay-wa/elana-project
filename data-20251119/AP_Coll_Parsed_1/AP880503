the united methodists voted tuesday to write 
mankind out of their hymns in favor of people and include 
portrayals of god as a feminine figure but the denomination didnt 
tamper with psalms 
the nations secondlargest protestant body overwhelmingly 
adopted a new hymnal that generally shifts to inclusive language 
for humans such as using all for men and people for 
mankind 
but members decided to retain masculine pronouns for god in the 
books psalms denying the request of several delegates to use 
genderneutral nouns such as gods rather than his 
delegates of the 96 millionmember denomination whose 
founder john wesley exhorted followers to sing lustily and with 
full courage approved the new hymnal by 893 to 69 
an exciting and historical moment proclaimed the rev c 
rex bevins of lincoln neb after applause quieted in the 
cervantes convention center packed with about 3000 visitors and 
observers 
it was the eighth day of the churchs 11day quadrennial 
governing conference delegates also approved a major revamped 
summary of doctrine reflecting a conservative shift in church 
attitudes 
it gives scripture a firmer primacy and eliminates an explicit 
acceptance of pluralism in concepts a key shift away from a 
recognition of divergent theologies including some embraced by 
feminists and leftist liberation movements 
but the new hymnbook replacing the old edition of 1966 
provided the zestful note of the day with several interludes of 
rousing song from the book and deliberations about it 
the hefty 960page volume combines ritual psalms and 625 
songs compared with 552 in the old book 
the hymnal has 330 songs new to methodists including gospel 
songs spirituals ethnic hymns and new compositions 
some hymns such as faith of our fathers and dear lord and 
father of mankind were not changed at all because they are 
imprinted deeply in peoples memories 
but the most popular easter hymn christ the lord is risen 
today was given a revised first verse changing sons of men and 
angels say to earth and heaven in chorus say 
the book also includes good christian friends rejoice 
instead of the old good christian men rejoice and substitutes 
god of the ages for god of our fathers 
the rev carlton young of nashville editor of the new hymnbook 
said the revision offered a chance to address god in alternative 
terms other than masculine but we backed off because of 
controversy 
as a result he said only three hymns offer feminine images of 
god several others were rejected 
those three include wonder of wonders and how can we name 
a love by british poet brian wren which portay god both as 
mother and father the third song the care the eagle gives her 
young compares god to a mother eagle 
the hymnal also retains many popular mainstays including many 
of wesleys 
at one point in the books genesis a massive reaction by 
members overturned a committee decision to delete onward 
christian soldiers and the battle hymn of the republic 
because of their militaristic metaphors it also keeps familiar 
revival hymns such as in the garden and jesus calls us 
often frowned on by musicologists 
tuesdays only substantial debate concerned the use of masculine 
pronouns for god in the books psalms they had been substituted 
with genderneutral nouns initially but a legislative committee 
recommended that masculine pronouns be restored and the conference 
agreed despite the opposition of some delegates 
bishop reuben p job of des moines who chaired the 25member 
committee that worked four years in compiling the volume said the 
voice of the whole church was involved in the process 
job told a news conference the new book will serve to draw 
this denomination toward its center toward christ it also will 
serve to open us to people and cultures to which we havent been 
sensitive

banks will reopen for nearly normal 
operations next monday after being closed for two months because of 
panamas economic and political crisis the president of the 
bankers association announced 
earlier tuesday the roman catholic church said it will not 
mediate the crisis until the civilian government that does gen 
manuel antonio noriegas bidding has a change of attitude 
edgardo lasso the bankers association president said in a 
television interview tuesday that to avoid a run on the banks the 
amount of cash depositors can withdraw will be restricted 
we are trying to reactivate the economy of the country 
lasso said 
we will take care of the public in all banking activities 
within the restrictions set by the governments banking commission 
late in march he said 
conditions for reopening the banks limit withdrawals to 25 
percent of checking account balances as of march 3 the day the 
government ordered banks closed it sets a maximum of 10000 with 
the rest frozen for 90 days 
withdrawals of up to 50 may be made from savings accounts one 
month after banks reopen 
payment of interest is restricted and subject to cash 
availability in each bank 
the commission has promoted a gradual reopening of the banks on 
april 18 it let them begin accepting deposits because of limits 
on withdrawals however about 75 percent of the checks deposited 
bounced analysts and business people said 
a week later about a dozen additional services were resumed 
including handling letters of credit collecting outstanding loans 
transferring funds within panama and making foreign exchange 
transfers but business people said the operations were largely on 
paper and did little to help resolve their problems of liquidity 
and credit 
the association represents 93 of the 117 banks operating here 
most of them foreign 
both the march 3 closing and the reopening applied to the 67 
banks holding licenses to conduct both local and international 
banking business 
others also closed their doors because of the impact of the 
crisis 
some closed as early as late february after noriega ousted 
president eric arturo delvalle following the presidents attempt 
tried to fire the military strongman 
the political instability us economic sanctions and the lack 
of banking facilities brought panamas economy to a nearstandstill 
the banking commission had urged the banks to reopen with some 
restrictions intended to maintain the cash position of the banks 
and protect depositors 
the church agreed at the end of march to mediate talks between 
the government and noriegas opponents it suspended the effort a 
week later 
in a statement issued tuesday the church accused the government 
and official news media of personal and institutional attacks 
on it and archbishop marcos gregorio mcgrath 
since the attacks have proliferated in government news media 
we assume the government rejects the mediation of the church it 
said 
monsignor jose maria carrizo villarreal vice president of the 
panamanian conference of bishops signed the statement 
the bishops had offered to seek an honorable way out for gen 
noriega as commander of the defense forces the opposition 
demands noriega leave as a condition for further talks but the 
government said it would not accept conditions for negotiating 
in washington guillermo cochez a spokesman for panamas 
opposition christian democratic party said noriega is considering 
stepping down on aug 12 which cochez said is noriegas fifth 
anniversary as defense chief 
noriega is under federal indictment in the united states on drug 
trafficking charges which he denies in its attempt to remove him 
the reagan administration imposed sanctions that include blocking 
panamanian assets in the united states and prohibiting us 
payments to panama 
the church has held the government responsible for the crisis 
but also blamed the economic domination of foreign powers and 
the corruption in the public and private sectors 
leaders of the opposition said tuesday they had held their first 
meeting aimed at establishing common objectives 
alfredo ramirez president of the liberal republican movement 
said the objectives include democratization of the country and 
the search for a solution to the economic and political crisis 
the united states still recognizes delvalle as panamas chief 
executive

less than two weeks after creating a potential 
new source of federal tax money the supreme court is denying a 
similar opportunity for state treasuries 
the justices on monday refused to let states tax pension fund 
income from investments in federal government securities 
on april 20 the court had ruled that the federal government may 
tax the interest earned on state and municipal bonds 
although congressional leaders say there is no plan to impose 
such taxes the courts ruling last month cleared away a 
constitutional hurdle in the event congress some day changes 
federal tax law 
justice william j brennan writing for the court on april 20 
said giving the federal government power to tax state and municipal 
bonds does not suggest that states should have reciprocal power 
states can never tax the united states directly he said 
the federal tax immunity has always been greater than the states 
immunity 
that opinion was reinforced indirectly monday as the court 
rejected an appeal by vermont officials seeking to tax income from 
such federal obligations as treasury bills and shortterm borrowing 
vermont officials said they should be allowed to tax the income 
after it is distributed to retirees 
the vermont supreme court last december upheld a ruling by a 
state judge who said the pension fund money is taxexempt 
superior court judge matthew i katz of windsor county ruled 
that interest on federal obligations is immune from state taxation 
even when the income is passed on by a pension fund to a retired 
investor 
in practical operation the tax in question was in fact a 
state tax on interest derived from federal obligations katz 
said the fact that pension money was passed on to someone other 
than the fund itself does not eliminate the exemption enjoyed by 
investments in federal securities he said 
the judge rejected arguments by state officials that interest on 
a government security is exempt only in the hands of the original 
recipient unless there is a specific federal statute to pass 
through the taxexempt character of such income 
katz ruled in favor of loren d keys who when he retired in 
1981 received a lumpsum distribution of 141000 from a savings 
plan in which he had invested 
the money included 35000 in interest on federal securities 
vermont officials said keys owed an additional tax of 1246 on 
the income from the government obligations the court rulings in 
keys favor meant he received a tax refund of 203 plus interest 
vermont officials said a lot more was at stake they said the 
state court rulings could force them to examine the source of 
payments from pension and mutual funds corporate dividends and 
even bank deposit interest and then eliminate from the states tax 
base any income traced to investments in federal obligations

it happened in england and the plot reminded 
the congressman from missouri of the title of an imaginary horror 
film the bullfrogs that ate britain 
according to rep jack buechner rmo british gardeners who 
raise goldfish in ornamental pools were looking for a way to scare 
off marauding cats that scooped the goldfish out of the pools and 
had them for lunch 
the solution a british pet store imported missouri tadpoles 
which are said to grow into footlong missouri bullfrogs large 
enough to give a british cat the fight of his or her life 
but said buechner alarmed environmentalists saw in all of this 
an unintended consequence 
ecologists protested that the carnivorous amphibians would eat 
native frogs and newts and wreck the areas ecological balance 
he said 
so the pet store recalled 400 missouri bullfrogs as a threat to 
the nativeborn inhabitants of british gardens buechner said and 
added this 
after hearing this i hopped over to the house floor to 
deliver this sad news to my colleagues 
lest the tiny creatures of britain croak it is far better 
that our missouri bullfrogs be recalled sounds like a horror film 
the bullfrogs that ate britain 
and so my colleagues i stand before you warts and all 
as a responsible missourian i believe that although we should 
not leap to conclusions we must ensure our frogs do not cause any 
undue harm in the land of thatcher 
so we welcome our british brethren to send back both our 
tadpoles and footlong bullfrogs back home 
imagine a footlong frog 
who would believe it 
its no wonder they call missouri the show me state

lady bird johnson was in washington last week to receive house 
and senate tributes on the 20th anniversary of the launching of her 
campaign to beautify the capital and the nations highways 
the celebration took place at a season appropriate to the 
occasion 
the flowers of spring most of them planted as a result of her 
labors were bursting like an explosion in a paint factory 
but the occasion perhaps inevitably also brought forth 
memories of president lyndon b johnsons legendary style and 
towering ego 
some went to the point of how lady bird coped with it all 
rep jake pickle dtexas who said he had been proud to call 
himself lbjs congressman told the house of the time mrs 
johnson had prepared dinner for guests at the lbj ranch only to 
find her husband was driving some of the guests around the ranch 
to show them the deer and the antelope and where the buffalo do 
not roam 
three times he said mrs johnson radioed the car using the 
secret service code names for the presidential couple 
volcano this is volunteer she said when can we serve 
dinner 
finally pickle said after hours of waiting lady birds 
voice came over the radio volcano this is volunteer our guests 
and i are sitting down at the table goodbye 
whereupon without a word the president wheeled his car 
around and returned to the ranch house so quickly he not only got 
there in time for dinner he got there in time to say the 
blessing 
another texan remembered a hunt at the lbj ranch for which 
johnson had made some unusual preparations he had hired an artist 
to record the results 
after it was over the artist produced five identical paintings 
showing johnson in the foreground bringing down a bird 
when johnson saw the results this texan said he sent it back 
for retouching 
the new version showed the president bringing down two birds 
not just one 
another tale teller told of a johnson friend using his car phone 
to call lbj who was riding in his car 
the purpose was to show he had his own car phone and he 
started bragging about it to johnson he said 
johnson produced an immediate display of oneupmanship 
johnson said let me put you on hold for a moment someones 
calling on my other line

a soviet scientist says that despite the delay 
in us space exploration caused by the challenger disaster his 
country is not ahead in space 
albert galeev cochairman of the ussr space research 
institute said monday that the soviets have taken advantage of the 
two years that the united states has not been able to launch 
satellites easily but he said both countries could learn from the 
other 
we never have had the illusion that we were ahead said 
galeev at a news conference at the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
temporarily youve lost launch capability but if you take 
into account the satellites waiting to be launched the 
understanding is that youll easily catch up he said 
the united states has not had regular space launches since 
challenger exploded and killed its seven crewmembers on jan 28 
1986 since then the space shuttle fleet which was the main us 
launch system has been grounded flights are scheduled to resume 
in august 
we took advantage of this delay said galeev we are still 
leading in a few fields 
he noted however that the soviet union has to launch more 
satellites because its equipment is not as durable as american 
models 
we launch a lot of satellites but their lifetime is shorter 
he said that means we dont get as much data 
a soviet astronomer rashid sunyaev also a cochairman of the 
ussr space research institute said scientists everywhere 
keenly felt the challenger accident 
challenger was a tragedy for astronomers he said because 
the space telescope is still on the ground 
sunyaev said astronomers are anxious for the americanmade 
telescope to be placed into orbit and to start bringing back new 
visions of the universe the telescope is to be the most powerful 
astronomy instrument ever placed into space 
in answer to a question sunyaev admitted that some of the 
scientific information gathered by the soviet space program has 
been used for military purposes but he said this can be said of 
many things learned by scientists 
even some of the work of issac newton has been used for 
military purposes he said newton formulated basic principles of 
gravity and motion 
galeev and sunyaev answered questions at a news conference that 
marked the end of a week of meetings with american colleagues who 
are members of the ussoviet joint working groups on astronomy 
and astrophysics representatives of the two spacefaring nations 
met to work out ways to exchange data from their space science 
programs 
nasa officials said the working groups arrived at an agreement 
but the plan will have to be approved by leaders of the two 
governments before it is released publicly

james traficant jr an ohio congressman 
waging an onagain offagain campaign for president is hoping to 
pick up a few delegates today in his home state but admits his 
chances of winning even his own congressional district are slim 
traficant a democrat from suburban youngstown who also is 
seeking his third term in congress announced last summer that he 
would run for president to attract attention to the problems of his 
congressional district which has been hard hit by the decline of 
the steel industry 
traficant said he would run a national campaign for the 
democratic presidential nomination but it never materialized he 
blamed a lack of money 
if i had the same amount of money these other candidates had 
in the state of ohio and could have come on tv the past two weeks 
there would have been a fight he said 
leesa brown of the ohio secretary of states office said 
traficant met the qualifications to get onto the ballot in 12 of 
ohios 21 congressional districts 
a former sheriff traficant is best known for successfully 
defending himself against charges that he accepted 163000 from 
mobsters in 1980 but he had little name recognition outside his 
own district 
william binning chairman of the political science department at 
youngstown state university said traficants presidential 
candidacy was actually given some credence early on because so many 
of the democratic candidates were not well known nationally 
but ultimately binning said i think traficant would have to 
win a major statewide office in ohio in order to be considered a 
viable candidate for president 
a survey conducted by youngstown states center for urban 
studies suggested residents of his district favor traficant as a 
congressman but not as a presidential candidate 
the poll commissioned by the youngstown vindicator indicated 
38 percent of the 697 people surveyed favor michael dukakis the 
democratic frontrunner with traficant supported by 14 percent and 
jesse jackson backed by 11 percent nearly a quarter of the 
participants were undecided 
however more than 70 percent of the same respondents supported 
traficants bid to a third term in congress 
the poll was conducted between april 11 and april 20 and had a 
margin of error of 56 percentage points

attorney general edwin meese iii is the 
apparent target of anonymous graffiti artists who have left 
inscriptions such as sleazy and resign on the walls of the 
main justice department building 
the graffiti began appearing at about the time two top aides to 
meese resigned march 29 due to concern about problems associated 
with the criminal investigation of meese 
the word sleazy last week was scrawled in black 4inchhigh 
letters on a secondfloor staircase in the middle of the building 
the stairwell is far from meeses fifthfloor office but is heavily 
traveled 
employees first noticed the graffiti there friday said a 
justice department lawyer who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the basement and firstfloor levels of the staircase are heavily 
traveled because they lead to the cafeteria 
in another instance the word resign was scribbled on a wall 
near meeses office but it was cleaned off quickly said department 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
such graffiti started appearing around the same time that deputy 
attorney general arnold burns and criminal division chief william 
weld submitted their protest resignations march 29 the course said 
burns and weld quit out of concern that meeses continued tenure 
as attorney general was hurting the justice departments operation

more areas violated federal clean air 
standards last year for ozone a principal part of smog while 
fewer violated the carbon monoxide standard the environmental 
protection agency said today 
sixtyeight urban and rural areas failed to meet the limit for 
ozone up from 62 last year fiftynine urban areas failed to meet 
the carbon monoxide standard down from 65 last year 
there is substantial overlap between the two lists and all the 
nations 24 largest metropolitan areas are on one or both the 
largest urban area not on either list is kansas city 
we had a hot dry summer in the east which tends to push up 
ozone levels said epa spokesman chris rice it was much like 
the summer of 1983 except confined to the east 
the decline in carbon monoxide was expected as more and more 
cars made before 1981 are junked cars made before then had to meet 
less stringent standards for exhaust pollution 
in addition the same weather that elevates ozone tends to 
depress carbon monoxide epa noted 
the carbon monoxide list is based on data for two years looking 
only at 1987 readings 37 cities would have failed to comply while 
50 would have flunked in 1986 
motor vehicle exhaust is the primary source of carbon monoxide 
which can interfere with the oxygencarrying capacity of the blood 
in most areas motor vehicles also are the major source of a key 
raw material for making smog unburned gasoline from both exhaust 
pipes and natural evaporation from the fuel system 
those gasoline vapors react in sunlight with oxides of nitrogen 
also present in exhausts as well as in power plant emissions to 
produce ozone the brighter and sunnier the day the more ozone 
that is produced 
ozone is the part of smog that interferes with breathing and 
makes the chest feel tight 
winds can blow the raw materials for ozone away from the source 
but they may still react in sunlight which accounts for violations 
in several rural counties in maine epa says the chemicals that 
made their ozone were emitted in the bostonwashington corridor 
because weather has such an influence on ozone epa judges 
compliance in threeyear blocks this years compliance is based on 
ozone readings for 19851987 
but weather can still push areas into and out of compliance for 
example pittsburgh detroit grand rapids mich and richmond 
va are listed as violators this year but were not last year all 
four were on the 1986 list using 19831985 data 
the relevant ozone readings for those four cities for 19851987 
are similar to those for 19831985 possibly because the summers of 
1983 and 1987 were similar rice said 
los angeles is far and away the national leader in ozone 
pollution with an average of 1435 days out of compliance per year 
over the threeyear period elsewhere only houston atlanta and 
philadelphia showed 10 or more estimated days per year in which the 
ozone standard would be exceeded on last years list houston new 
york much of urban connecticut dallas and el paso texas showed 
such days 
epas lists were produced three months early this year to help 
congress decide what to do about areas that fail to meet the 
standards 
congress has prohibited epa from taking any action against 
noncomplying areas until aug 31 while it debates the issue 
epa had planned penalties for some areas for failure to comply 
with planning requirements 
the turnover of the motor vehicle fleet will eventually bring 
all but a handful of areas into compliance with the carbon monoxide 
standard epa believes rice said agency analysts now estimate that 
just four to six cities would not comply eventually 
for ozone however 25 or more cities will not comply without 
more stringent control measures epa says

manslaughter in the death of their 2yearold son who died after 
they refused to seek medical help for him because of their beliefs

magistrate gary wilson set a pretrial conference for june 1 and 
ordered the twitchells who have two other sons released on their 
recognizance 
the twitchells are the second christian science parents to be 
prosecuted in massachusetts and the first since 1971 when the 
state amended the child abuse and neglect law to recognize 
spiritual healing as an alternative to modern medicine 
followers of christian science refuse medicine or other health

ancient custom permits one woman in kenya 
to take another as a wife but a divorce case involving two 
such women has thrown up a challenge to kenyas westernstyle legal 
system 
the case involves wanjiru gutu a barren widow who 10 years ago 
took mary njeri macharia as a wife to bear her the children she 
desperately wanted 
the relationship went sour and the women have asked a 
westernstyle divorce court to sort out their broken marriage 
including the question of alimony child support and property 
settlement 
we dont have a precedent for this case said paul mberi 
ms macharias lawyer 
the problem we have is that our legal system as practiced in 
the courts is changing to the western legal system but at the same 
time in the village we are living with people whose arrangements 
are based on customary law concepts 
marriage between women is not uncommon in kenya and neither is 
divorce 
but this case is unique because the couple has turned to western 
laws instead of adhering to custom and letting tribal elders 
decide the issue 
barren women such as ms gutu often take one or more fertile 
women as wives to bear children which the female husband 
then claims as her own even married women make such arrangements 
with the husband of the barren woman fathering children by his 
spouses wife 
barren women often are ostracized in africa where wealth and 
prestige still are measured by the number of children a couple has 
since both ms macharia and ms gutu were single ms macharia 
was entitled to choose the man to father the children 
for the surrogate mother such an arrangement offers the 
security of a home and income 
ms macharia in her late 20s was a single mother of two 
children aged 12 and 10 when she married ms gutu and took her 
surname she brought them to ms gutus home and had two more 
children now 7 and 5 
after a fierce quarrel in january 1986 ms gutu chased her 
wife from their matrimonial home in the western kenyan town of 
nakuru according to court records 
before turning to the westernstyle courts ms macharia twice 
went to a court of tribal elders asking for alimony and child 
support or a share of ms gutus property including a small 
grocery store 
ms gutu about 60 complained that ms macharia beat her 
threatened her life and stole from the business 
both times the elders ruled that ms macharia could keep the 
children but should receive nothing else 
this was not a hardship in the past as the woman would go 
back to her father and his community which jointly owned and 
shared land and resources explained gibson kamau kuria a 
nairobi lawyer who specializes in family law 
ms macharia did return to her father a peasant farmer near 
nakuru but when she felt that she and the children were a burden 
she sued her former husband for divorce in the district 
magistrates court again demanding alimony and child support or a 
share of ms gutus property 
she filed suit in august 1986 but the case has been delayed by 
a backlog and is expected to be heard soon 
ms gutu had told the tribal courts ms macharia had no money or 
property when they married and that the relationsip gave her 
status and a comfortable lifestyle 
odhiambo ochieng ms gutus lawyer argues in an affidavit 
that because the marriage is recognized only by customary law only 
a traditional solution is possible for ms macharia to return to 
her fathers family with nothing 
kenyas very diversity is at the root of the nowbudding legal 
problems 
the east african nations 22 million people are divided among 
dozens of ethnic groups who abide by islamic hindu and various 
tribal customary laws in addition to the statutory western laws 
inherited from british colonizers at independence 25 years ago 
a case last year pitted the widow of a prominent lawyer sm 
otieno against his luo clansmen in a tussle over whether the widow 
or the tribe should bury him the high court ruled that in the 
absence of written law customary law prevails 
otienos widow lost 
these problems are going to have to be tackled and will not go 
away until kenya is lived in by an overall younger and more modern 
generation ochieng said

gov michael s dukakis who has made his 
efficiency as a manager one of the key selling points in his 
presidential campaign is struggling to balance his state budgets 
for this year and next year 
dukakis budgetbalancing efforts are turning into something of 
a balancing act because his status as the democratic frontrunner 
puts him under intense scrutiny 
supporters of republican rival george bush are hoping the 
situation will provide them with ammunition they can use against 
the governor 
dukakis boasts that he has given massachusetts nine balanced 
budgets as governor including the current one for fiscal 1988 and 
that he will do the same for the coming fiscal year 
but hell have to find some way to make up a 77 million revenue 
shortfall this year and already has proposed 233 million in 
additional cuts to offset supplementary spending 
we will make the necessary adjustments which will make it 
possible for us to live within our income dukakis said last week 
he said there are a number of ways to do that but hasnt 
said exactly which way he favors 
bush backers were rubbing their hands in anticipation 
i think it raises a credibility issue for the governor said 
sen paul cellucci george bushs state campaign chairman he has 
talked about balancing a federal budget yet it appears he is going 
to have difficulty with a fiscal 1989 state budget 
dukakis said he will work matters out with the legislature but 
some lawmakers are grumbling that that hasnt happened yet 
you are telling us you are going to work with us and you 
havent worked with us rep christopher hodgkins a democrat on 
the budgetwriting house ways and means committee told dukakis 
budget chief frank keefe during an appearance before the 
committee last week 
no one doubts that the budgets ultimately will be balanced 
because they must be under the state constitution but how dukakis 
does it could become a campaign issue 
he is either going to have to raise taxes or cut human 
services spending neither of which he wants to do so its 
something we republicans are obviously going to watch very 
carefully said cellucci 
advocacy groups fighting to keep funding for their programs are 
mindful of dukakis status as a presidential candidate 
i think the governor running for president has created a 
situation where the advocates feel that they can leverage his 
cooperation more that they can make him look bad if they dont 
get what they want said barbara salisbury the state budget 
director 
dukakis and his aides have consistently said he will not cut 
existing services to balance this years budget but will instead 
clamp down on program expansions primarily in human services but 
even that tactic is bringing complaints 
people were promised they were going to get this service 
and they still havent gotten it yet said deborah weinstein 
executive director of the massachusetts human services coalition 
that is suffering and you cant take that away 
the dukakis administration had projected 66 percent revenue 
growth but this week reduced its estimate to 57 percent even so 
house ways and means chairman richard voke says the 
administrations revenue estimates are too optimistic 
a large part of the shortfall is blamed on smallerthanexpected 
corporate tax collections due to a state law allowing state 
companies to use losses on outofstate subsidiaries to reduce 
their massachusetts tax bill 
dukakis has proposed changing this measure meanwhile the state 
has an appeal pending with the massachusetts supreme court 
the governor has proposed a 700 million package of savings and 
revenue increases to balance his fiscal 1989 budget some of the 
controversial features include 
recouping 70 million in unclaimed bottle deposits from 
beverage wholesalers that issue is also before the courts 
spending 22 million for more tax collectors some of the 
nearly 1600 new jobs contained in the budget to raise 190 
million in new revenue 
raising 55 million by requiring applicants for medicaid 
nursing home coverage to agree to a state lien on their homes for 
reimbursement after they die the administration has modified the 
proposal to say medicaid eligibility will be delayed after 
applicants transfer assets to others depending on the size of the 
transfers

vice president george bush says michael 
dukakis is displaying his lack of experience on foreign affairs 
with macho talk about how to oust panamas dictator 
bush was headed to morgantown wva today to visit research 
facilities at west virginia university before returning home for a 
belated victory party this evening to celebrate his clinching the 
number of delegates needed to win the gop presidential nomination 
west virginias primary is a week from today 
on a primaryeve campaign swing to ohio and indiana on monday 
bush ridiculed both dukakis and jesse jackson for what the vice 
president said was naivete about how panamans strongman manuel 
antonio noriega should be dealt with 
youd think its a cinch listening to these guys throw out 
noriega do this do that bush said 
noriega is under a us drug indictment in pressuring him to 
step down bush said the united states must avoid moves that hurt 
the panamanian people or seem like some great bullying 
gringosofthenorth kind of overstatement of power 
bush told high school students in vandalia ohio that were 
still living down past military intervention in central america 
ninety percent are now living under democracy in this 
hemisphere we dont want to set that back by some kind of macho 
statement out of harvard bush said dukakis was a lecturer at 
harvards john f kennedy school of government 
even with the nomination all but in hand bush was continuing to 
campaign in primary states on wednesday he heads to california 
which votes june 7 
bushs celebration tonight comes a week after he actually 
obtained his mathematical lock on the nomination he secured the 
last few delegates he needed in the pennsylvania primary on april 
26 
aides had thought it would take todays round of contests in 
ohio indiana and the district of columbia to put him over the 
top 
bush told 1200 supporters at the canton civic center monday 
evening they say what in gods name are you doing in canton 
ohio when you got this republican nomination wrapped up i will 
not project in overconfidence i will not project in arrogance 
i will work right down to the republican convention and with 
your help in the fall will be the next president of the united 
states he said he predicted a classical confrontation in 
the general election with a liberal democrat nominee 
stephen hart a bush spokesman said president reagan is not 
expected at tonights over the top celebration at a posh 
washington hotel there had been speculation that reagan who has 
stayed neutral during the gop primaries would use the occasion to 
formally endorse bush 
bush said in mishawaka ind on monday i had the feeling the 
president did endorse me at lunch the other day 
that was a reference to a private white house meeting with the 
president at which reagan congratulated him for his pennsylvania 
win and the white house indicated a formal endorsement would come 
soon 
bush seemed exasperated when the question was raised again by 
local reporters in canton 
do you think theres any doubt in any credible persons mind 
about who hes for so whats the big deal he said youll see 
an endorsement soon so stay tuned

the political joustings coded language and 
sophistictated election arguments of paris fade long before they 
reach this french provincial capital 
to the residents of foix president francois mitterrand and 
challenger jacques chirac are just about the same 
do you know what bof means asks 80yearold roger boy a 
retired draftsman as he sipped his morning coffee on the main 
square of this lovely town nestled in the foothills of the pyrenees 
bof is a french expression that amounts to a verbal shrug and 
thats exactly how boy and many other inhabitants of foix view 
sundays election runoff between the socialist president and the 
conservative premier 
whether its one or the other things will continue just the 
same said boy its le bof in general 
foix a town of about 10000 residents 500 miles from paris is 
the capital of the ariege department one of the least populated 
districts of the country it is dominated by the 11th century 
chateau of the counts of foix perched on a massive rock overlooking 
the town 
the area has a long socialist tradition and because of this 
mitterrand is favored but with more resignation than enthusiasm 
on april 24 in the first round of voting the ariege gave 
mitterrand 41 percent of its vote seven points above the 
presidents national score and 18 percent to chirac two points 
under his overall showing 
mitterrand no doubt will win again here sunday but it will be a 
gut vote more than a carefully reasoned choice 
jacques doumenc who for the past 25 years has been the local 
correspondent for the toulouse newspaper 50 miles away put it best 
when he said the things people here really care about are 
television reception and a proposed tunnel to spain 
mitterrand doesnt have a program for after may 8 said 
gerard firon a local homebuilder really there is no 
fundamental difference between the two and they both need the le 
pen vote 
jeanmarie le pen leader of the extreme right national front 
won 144 percent in the first round stunning many political 
observers le pen campaigned hard on a platform of ridding france 
of its immigrants and cracking down on law and order 
in the ariege despite its leftist tradition le pen won 103 
percent its hard to find somebody who will own up to voting for 
the extreme right and many fuxiens as local residents are called 
were looking suspiciously at their neighbors last week 
bernard rouch lounged on a bench in foixs packed criminal 
court wearing the traditional black bailiffs robe a crowd waited 
for the jury to return its verdict in a sensational local murder 
case 
the ariege is a place where we live well he said there 
is no pollution no racism there is unemployment yes but we 
live well i dont know about le pen its a rejection phenomenon 
despite the lack of enthusiasm for mitterrand polls after the 
first round show him winning the runoff by scores ranging from 
5347 percent to 5743 percent 
mitterrand still represents a popular image that no other 
political group can match said defense attorney yves saez just 
before the jury convicted his client and sentenced her to 12 years 
in prison for bludgeoning her husband to death 
in the cafe de la mairie on the night of the great debate 
between mitterrand and chirac most of the clientele sat in the 
back room drinking and socializing up front where the debate was 
on the television only a few folks paid attention 
lined up on a bench were four workingclass men in their 30s and 
40s stonefaced arms crossed after the twohour debate they got 
up as a unit and left one of them in another typical french 
mannerism expressed his opinion by filling his cheeks with air and 
letting it out with a soft puff 
theyre all the same 
the next morning at the farmers market a peasant selling her 
cheese declared herself for mitterrand but was hard put to explain 
why 
we live on agricultural subsidies she said for peasants 
its an absolute necessity 
has chirac threatened to cut subsidies 
well you have the feeling that you are listened to under the 
left under the right decisions are made without consultation and 
thats it

president reagans advisers are recommending 
that he veto a bill which would grant some new benefits to atomic 
veterans the american servicemen exposed to radiation in the 
1945 occupation of japan or during postworld war ii tests of 
nuclear weapons 
the bill was sent to reagan after the house approved it monday 
on a 3262 vote which would be far above the twothirds majority 
needed to override any veto 
however the senate margin last week was just 4830 indicating 
that a veto could be sustained there 
the veterans administration opposes the bill and says there is 
no direct evidence proving that the veterans exposure is causing 
current health problems 
the bill was part of a larger measure authorizing benefits for 
some 27 million veterans but it was stripped out after 
administration officials said they would recommend a veto of the 
overall bill because of the atomic veterans provision 
the measure would cover an estimated 250000 us military 
personnel who were in hiroshima or nagasaki after us atomic bombs 
were dropped on those japanese cities in august 1945 or who took 
part in openair tests of us nuclear weapons in the southern 
pacific ocean or in nevada after the war 
many have health problems which they say are related to their 
radiation exposure but the veterans administration says they cant 
get disability benefits unless they can show a direct link to their 
service duty 
the bill establishes a presumptive link and sets out 13 types of 
cancers for which the veterans could receive disability payments 
according to rep j roy rowland dga the va has only allowed 
44 of the 6000 claims filed by atomic veterans 
the chairman of the house veterans affairs committee rep gv 
montgomery dmiss said the vas standard cant be met because 
the level of exposure cannot be verified 
he said that during the tests some personnel didnt wear 
radiationmonitoring badges other servicemen lost their badges and 
some badges were found to be ineffective 
rep bob mcewen rohio called the bill a reasonable and 
modest approach to the problem if we err in our approach and 
i think we do not then we err on the side of compassion he said

the chairman of a soviet delegation says 
prospects are good for collaboration with a us company to develop 
new nuclear power reactors 
the company ga technologies of san diego calif built the 
only working commercial gascooled reactor in the united states 
the fort st vrain plant of colorado public service co near denver 
a joint ussoviet committee on peaceful uses of atomic energy 
last week visited ga technologies for talks on development of 
socalled modular hightemperature gascooled reactors 
in a ceremony at the state department on monday in which the 
heads of both delegations signed a document recommending renewal of 
the cooperation agreement the soviet chairman alexandor n 
protsenko said we think the prospects are very good for 
collaboration with ga technologies in this area as well as with 
other companies 
the agreement was begun by president nixon and soviet leader 
leonid brezhnev in 1973 it was renewed in 1983 and 1985 
asked just what form cooperation with ga technologies might 
take protsenko who is chairman of the state committee for the 
utilization of atomic energy said through an interpreter the 
soviet and united states delegations were discussing a possible 
collaborative program with the company in the context of the 
general agreement 
but he added we dont exclude the possibility that our 
cooperation will lead to a time where we might have a separate 
agreement with ga technologies 
gascooled reactors have been widely used in europe but neither 
the soviet union nor the united states has favored them for 
civilian power 
they do offer certain safety advantages such as slow reaction 
to disturbances modular designs which could be built efficiently 
in small sizes so utilities could add generating capacity only as 
needed have attracted increasing attention both in the united 
states and the soviet union and the soviets plan to complete 
construction of two in 1995 
the modular hightemperature gascooled reactor is a good 
example of a safe economically feasible new generation of 
reactor protsenko said

democrat michael dukakis is looking ahead to the 
november election with calls for vice president george bush to 
provide more information about his role in the irancontra affair 
and the reagan administrations dealings with panama 
the democratic frontrunner also turned aside criticism from 
jesse jackson but continued to avoid any sharp attacks on his 
democratic rival 
dukakis was back home in boston today after a day of 
primaryeve campaigning in ohio and indiana where he held a 
substantial lead in the polls the district of columbia is holding 
a primary today too with jackson seen as sure to win there 
dukakis trying to prevent overconfidence in his camp urged 
supporters to disregard the polls in ohio and indiana 
this is not over he said its very very important that 
we get a big turnout 
at the same time though the democratic frontrunner was 
warming up for a fall campaign against bush 
bush has been criticizing dukakis for foreign policy 
inexperience and did so again monday dukakis in turn questioned 
the administrations dealings with panamanian strongman manuel 
antonio noriega who is under us indictment on drug charges and 
bushs role in other foreign policy matters including the 
irancontra affair 
this administration for the past 7 years has broken the law 
i think the vice president has to address the issue he said 
in an interview with the associated press 
i want to know why we were doing business with noriega why 
they were paying off noriega why they were doing business with a 
drugrunning panamanian dictator he told reporters in cleveland 
thats the first thing we need a full explanation and i think 
the people of america are entitled to it 
earlier dukakis said bush was promising to be the education 
president without saying whether he opposed administration 
cutbacks in college financial aid programs 
i dont know where the vice president stands on education 
dukakis said i dont know if he has a program 
in addition to criticism from bush dukakis has come under 
increasing fire from jackson in recent days but dukakis refused to 
respond directly 
i hope we can keep it positive he said upon arriving in 
boston while we have some differences we respect each other 
in cleveland responding to jacksons suggestion that he lacks 
leadership dukakis ticked off his administrations 
accomplishments including his states 29 percent unemployment 
rate and legislation providing health care for all workers 
thats a lot of fire and a lot of productivity dukakis 
said im not just a talker im a doer theres no question 
about my record 
in an interview with japanese television dukakis said he would 
try to negotiate a trade agreement with japan that accommodated 
both nations he also called on japan to increase its aid to 
developing nations 
i would also hope that japan could do a great deal in third 
world countries with its surpluses he said

audrey deetz thought her traveling days were 
over when she was diagnosed as having emphysema but this week 
shes packing for her third caribbean cruise accompanied by a 
hospital medical team 
for the third year university hospitals of cleveland is sending 
a doctor nurses and therapists on a weeklong cruise with a group 
of people with chronic lung diseases the trip begins sunday from 
fort lauderdale with ports of call including jamaica and grand 
cayman 
you might say were all in the same boat said the 
73yearold ms deetz we all have something in common we 
understand each others problems 
dr michael nochomovitz medical director of the hospitals 
pulmonary treatment center said many people with breathing 
problems are afraid to travel because of their unstable health 
they live for years with the anxiety of something happening 
suddenly said nochomovitz who went on the first two trips 
cruise lines are not equipped to handle complex medical illnesses 
and you cant expect them to be 
he said the hospitalsponsored cruise developed after a patient 
brought up the problem of traveling besides the patients fear 
theres the problem of carrying oxygen supplies and other medical 
equipment along he said 
some airlines and cruise lines wont allow the equipment a 
situation that nochomovitz wants changed 
somehow weve got to set up a system to accommodate these 
people so they can live as near as normal lives as possible he 
said 
university hospitals plans the cruise with a supplier of home 
medical equipment that publicizes the trip among its customers the 
first cruise drew about 25 people including 17 patients last 
year the group swelled to 80 people about half patients from 
more than a dozen states 
the cost of the cruise ranges from 1600 to 2000 
nochomovitz said this years trip was almost canceled because of 
coast guard restrictions on portable oxygen tanks on cruise ships 
but nochomovitz said an exemption was obtained to allow about three 
dozen to make the trip 
some past participants hadnt traveled for years because of 
their health problems said nochomovitz for many of the 
patients this is a goal he said 
the trip has many side effects as well he added 
its humbling to see how this experience improves on the 
patients sense of well being achievement and independence 
nochomovitz said 
ms deetz said the first hospitalsponsored cruise gave her the 
confidence to continue traveling 
she was found to have emphysema about four years ago after 
returning from a trip to stockholm the cruise was her next trip 
i thought my travels were over and thats why i jumped at 
the first cruise said ms deetz of suburban berea 
next weeks cruise will be her fifth in three years and shes 
planning a trip to europe this summer with one of her three sons 
she takes along a breathing machine for daily treatment 
i enjoy the cruises theyre really wonderful for people like 
me she said

one day after a water rationing plan took 
effect decorative fountains fell idle bar tabs grew and plumbing 
supply stores reported brisk sales of watersaving devices 
san francisco residents have been told to cut consumption by 25 
percent in response to the areas most severe water shortage since 
the 197677 drought but many of the cutbacks will be highly 
visible to the hundreds of thousands of tourists who crowd the 
citybythebay each summer 
only fountains that use recycled water like the one in front 
of city hall continued to flow monday others were still filled 
with water but no longer sprayed it into the air or let it tumble 
from sculpted waterfalls 
restaurants no longer serve water to diners automatically many 
like maxwells plum at ghirardelli square have posted signs 
advising diners of the regulation 
i would say right now about onequarter of the customers have 
asked for water said dining director robert stewart as he 
observed the popular restaurants luncheon crowd 
if one person at a table asks for water only he gets water 
said stewart 
business at the bar was up stewart said 
at lunch most people have a beverage they have a drink they 
have a little wine he said the only people who might complain 
are usually from the midwest you know they dont generally drink 
alcohol as much 
homeowners were snatching up plumbing supplies such as sink 
washers and flowrestricting shower heads 
at the supermarketlike goodmans lumber store plumbing manager 
andy pappas said he was especially busy sunday afternoon as 
customers sought ways to cut water use in their homes 
he said people were especially interested in watersaving shower 
heads which goodmans stocks at prices ranging from 5 to 40 
the expensive ones have more adjustments for the spray pappas 
said 
we carry a flow restrictor kit for about 3 but it seems 
like theyre more interested in putting on a new head he said 
were also selling a lot of washers 
were getting a lot of questions on what to do to save 
water he said theyre bugging us pretty good on that 
meanwhile city officials confirmed that 12 million gallons of 
water per year enough to supply 30000 households are wasted 
cooling city hall computers without any recycling system the water 
is pumped continuously through four huge air conditioners that keep 
the temperature cool for the basement computers city engineers 
said 
the city public works department will ask the board of 
supervisors this week for an emergency fund to buy a water tower 
that would recycle the waste said richard evans public works 
director 
the water has been dumped down the drain after one pass for 22 
years he said explaining why no tower was built into the design 
with technology what it is a water cooling tower 10 years ago 
might have been the size of city hall said evans 
residents wont know exactly how much water they need to save 
until midmay city officials will send a notice to each household 
telling them how many gallons they used during an average month 
during the past year and hence how much they need to save 25 
percent 
city officials actually expect people to cut their personal use 
by 10 percent and reduce outdoor uses like car washing and lawn 
watering by 60 percent 
residents who dont save enough will pay premium prices for the 
extra water they use anyone who doesnt think their allotment is 
fair can appeal 
although there was a chance of rain in the forecast for today 
water officials said its highly unlikely northern california will 
get enough rain this season to make up for its extremely dry winter

some people write as a hobby 
scribbling in journals or dashing off verse and short stories for 
nothing more than their own pleasure 
others be they authors of flashy ad campaigns creators of tv 
sitcoms or this years hemingway are blessed with enough talent 
and good fortune to do it for money 
but van garner a mental patientturnedpoet and songwriter 
uses his typewriter to exorcise the demons that led him to two 
nervous breakdowns and a bout with alcoholism 
its been the real savior for me writing he says 
because it gave me a chance to bring out my inner feelings 
garner 55 of chattanooga is the author of deep within a 
recently published collection of poetry and a gospel music album 
polished by the master to be released this month 
his voice deliberate and thoughtful his eyes lively theres 
little in garners demeanor to suggest his rocky past but his work 
is the culmination of a journey that began 28 years ago at warner 
robins air force base in georgia 
thats where garner was stationed when he suffered his first 
nervous breakdown although granted an honorable discharge after 
observation by military officials he soon checked into a veterans 
administration mental hospital in murfreesboro 
the doctors diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic he 
suffered from feelings of persecution marked by flights of fantasy 
illogical thinking and hallucinations 
i would be depressed one moment then id go to another 
extreme and be as high as a kite he said 
he spent three months in locked confinement then another 
patient suggested he enter a hospitalized veterans writing project 
contest reluctantly he submitted an article 
then another and some short stories and poetry nearly all 
focused on his illness one poem the apple read in part 
take an apple from a tree 
pretend that apple is me 
now cut the apple in half 
hear one part cry one part laugh 
he won some prizes but that wasnt the important thing putting 
the words down seemed to release something within him 
the more i wrote the better i felt garner said 
in 1965 after five years of hospitalization he was discharged 
i literally wrote myself out of the hospital he said 
two years later he met and married helen his wife of 21 years 
he suffered another nervous breakdown and was hospitalized for 
three months in 1972 but he hasnt been back in the hospital 
garners work has appeared in numerous poetry anthologies and 
he has published two collections of short stories 
dick green whose gampg publishers of nashville published deep 
within remembered his first impression of garners poetry 
he was almost like an inner soul crying out green said 
there was something there that really sort of got to me 
garner doesnt expect his efforts to make him rich but he 
figures hes already done pretty well 
i want to tell people what i went through so it may help 
someone else who may say well this is the end i had a nervous 
breakdown and this is the end of the world he said 
but it isnt the end its just the beginning

japanese authorities on tuesday investigated the 
apparent engine failures that caused a united airlines jumbo jet 
with 258 people aboard to make an emergency landing with only one 
of its four engines working 
the plane landed safely monday after two of the engines stopped 
over the pacific and the third stopped just before the landing an 
airline official said 
kyodo news service quoting airport and airline officials it did 
not identify said the pilot shut off the engines after noticing 
problems with fuel gauges it was not known if that meant the plane 
was running out of fuel 
united spokesman katsuro isa said emergency vehicles stood by at 
the new tokyo international airport in narita 40 miles northeast 
of tokyo but the boeing 747 taxied to the terminal under its own 
power 
none of the 239 passengers and 19 crew members on the los 
angelestokyo flight was injured he said 
ual flight 97 was 39000 feet above the pacific and about 125 
miles from narita when the first engine stopped kyodo reported 
isa said that half an hour later 45 minutes before landing the 
second engine stopped and the pilot radioed the narita control 
tower for an expedited approach the third engine stopped 
shortly before the plane landed at 317 pm 
passenger shinobu murota 21 said flight attendants ordered 
people to put on life jackets as the plane approached japan and 
said they might have to make an emergency landing 
a few minutes later the sound of the engine suddenly stopped 
and i felt as if the plane was floating in the air like a hang 
glider ms murota told the associated press 
passengers cheered and applauded when the boeing 747100 settled 
on the runway kyodo said 
i expected death at any moment it quoted kazuko kato as 
saying mrs kato who was returning from her honeymoon shouted at 
her husband when the plane landed thank goodness we didnt die 
boeing spokesman david jimenez in seattle wash said the safe 
landing did not surprise him 
almost any aircraft we have is capable of operating on one 
engine he said jimenez said he did not know of another 747 
losing power in three engines 
a tokyo newspaper the yomiuri shimbun said in its tuesday 
editions that while the jumbo jet was some 120 miles from narita 
control tower authorities at the airport received the following 
message from the pilot out of the four main engines the 
condition of no 1 and no 4 engines at both ends is bad and i want 
to make an emergency landing 
the newspaper account added according to the transport 
ministry the narita airport office and the airline during the 
flight the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the 
engine from the fuel tank showed there was almost no fuel going 
into engines number 1 and 4 and that the no 3 engine was also 
malfunctioning 
for this reason the pilot turned off the number 1 and 4 
engines at about 200 pm and 240 pm tuesday local time 
consecutively after requesting emergency landing permission from 
control authorities he turned off engine 3 just before beginning 
to glide in for a landing 
a statement released by united airlines in chicago said in part 
that about one hour and 15 minutes before the jetliner landed it 
lost power in one of the four engines about 30 minutes later they 
lost power to a second engine and just before landing they lost 
power to a third engine the plane landed safely and taxied to the 
terminal under its own power where the passengers deplaned in a 
normal fashion the cause of the incident is still under 
investigtion 
the mishap occurred several hours after the government urged 
japanese airlines to ground and do maintenance checks on boeing 737 
jets of the model that lost part of its fuselage last week on an 
interisland flight in hawaii 
an official of the transport ministrys engineering deparment 
said the 21 boeing 737s in japan are operated by all nippon 
airways air nippon and the airline nansei koku

police say theyll try to work with groups 
planning demonstrations during this summers democratic national 
convention but warn that space is limited and that protests will 
have to be scheduled 
only five groups have applied so far for demonstration permits 
during the july convention but many more are expected 
we assume well have a lot of diverse groups here and to the 
extent we can accommodate them we plan to said deputy chief 
wj taylor we dont want anyone to feel they are not welcome 
however the american civil liberties union charged last week 
that was exactly what was happening and threatened legal action 
unless the city clarified the procedures it intends to follow for 
handling protest groups 
the aclus key complaint is that the city has not adopted rules 
and procedures for permitting demonstrations margaret l dudney a 
staff attorney for the organizations georgia chapter said monday 
she also contended that the city has not said whether it intends 
to adhere to existing rules requiring seven days notice for street 
marches and 30 days notice to hold political gatherings in parks 
in addition some city officials have indicated that downtown 
parks will not be available for demonstrations she said 
taylor said those problems are being addressed 
the problem is theres not that much available space he 
said 
taylor said the city is trying to secure two parking lots 
directly across from the omni the convention site to serve as 
staging areas for demonstrations some downtown parks also may be 
used he said 
the advancenotice rules for street demonstrations and park use 
will be waived he said so long as organized groups have obtained 
permits 
no applications have been processed yet and none will be acted 
on until june he said 
those already seeking permits are the international society for 
krishna consciousness the lenora fulani committee which supports 
ms fulanis new yorkbased new alliance party campaign for the 
presidency a committee supporting legislative equality for 
homosexuals a local group calling itself arts pluribus unum 
and another local group called alternative 88 the group was formed 
by the owners of the metroplex nightclub in atlanta 
partner james fleter said the group is designed to serve as a 
loose coordinating group for different groups that will be raising

the stalemate that doomed opecs latest 
meeting also dimmed prospects for creating a new global alliance of 
oil producers 
the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries says 
it will press ahead with efforts to establish closer ties with 
other oil producers but the going is likely to be slow 
opec wants to persuade as many independent producers as possible 
to join the cartel in restraining production as a means of getting 
prices up to opecs official target of 18 a barrel 
hisham nazer the oil minister of saudi arabia said on monday 
in vienna there was unanimous recognition in opec that opec 
alone cannot keep supplies low enough to prevent prices from 
lagging 
last week a group of six independent producers led by mexico 
met with a committee of six opec oil ministers and presented an 
offer well cut our oil exports by 5 percent if you do likewise 
the two groups issued a joint communique declaring the 
beginning of a new stage of cooperation among some of the biggest 
oilproducing countries in the world but thats as far as it went 
the nonopec officials left town and all 13 of the opec 
ministers spent four days debating the offer only to suspend the 
talks after falling into a bitter impasse 
cartel leaders said they were not explicitly rejecting the 
nonopec offer they just wanted more time to think it over 
the offer by mexico egypt china oman malaysia and oman was 
for two months of production cuts only starting may 1 
now that the starting date has passed and the opec leaders have 
gone home there is little chance the two groups will get back to 
considering joint production cuts before next year thats because 
oil demand is expected to rise in the second half of this year 
eliminating the incentive on both sides to grapple with the problem 
of sharing any cutbacks 
this is likely to be welcomed in washington energy secretary 
john herrington has publicly campaigned against what he called 
efforts to create a world opec 
even so opec says it will try to keep alive a dialogue with 
nonopec exporters including the soviet union which ranks as the 
worlds largest oil producer the united states is the no 2 
producer 
it is important that we keep talking to them rilwanu 
lukman the opec president said of the six independent exporters 
who met in vienna the opportunity given to us is one that we 
cannot take lightly 
the reasons are obvious opecs capacity for influencing oil 
prices has been gradually eroded by the emergence of new oil 
producers in all corners of the globe 
ironically it was the sudden and severe increases in opec oil 
prices in the 1970s that created the financial incentive for 
countries to step up the search for oil in recent years norway 
china angola colombia and many other nations have joined the 
ranks of oil exporters 
as production outside its control steadily rose opec 
reluctantly chose to cut its output in a vain attempt to prevent 
prices from falling 
today the cartel pumps about 175 million barrels a day 
compared with a peak in 1978 of 31 million barrels daily in that 
same period nonopec output has jumped from about 22 million 
barrels daily to more than 28 million 
this year alone nonopec oil output is expected to rise by 
800000 barrels a day opecs probably will not grow at all 
all oil exporters naturally want to get as much for their 
product as possible but they seem to have little prospect for 
overcoming the political and economic differences that make formal 
cooperation with opec hard to achieve 
there just isnt a community of interest between them said 
paul mcdonald a londonbased oil consultant youre either a 
member of opec or not nobodys knocking down the door to join 
opec

a government scientist says researchers have 
found that the bone marrow can become a quiet haven for the deadly 
aids virus adding to the types of cells in the body known to be 
attacked by the virus 
anthony s fauci director of the national institute of allergy 
and infectious diseases said monday that the bone marrow which is 
the bodys bloodmaking organ can be a reservoir for the virus 
it the aids virus can reside in the marrow but not be 
detected in the peripheral blood he said 
the finding demonstrates just how challenging it will be to 
develop an antiviral drug or vaccine to defeat the aids virus said 
fauci in order to effect a cure some way will have to be found to 
seek out and destroy the virus wherever it hides

the world bank has placed its loans to panama

country has paid nothing for six months on the 502 million it owes 
the change in status announced monday means the bank no longer 
includes on its own statements the interest and other charges due 
from panama until money is actually received 
placing loans in a nonaccrual status is an accounting action 
which does not reduce in any way the countrys obligation to the 
bank or the banks ability to assist the country in formulating 
policies to help redress its economic difficulties the 
announcement said 
the bank owned by 151 countries is the biggest single source

scientists have developed eggs that dont 
raise human cholesterol levels like regular eggs and are trying to 
prevent heart disease by identifying food chemicals that reduce 
blood cholesterol 
both efforts at making diets healthier were outlined monday at 
the annual meeting of the federation of american societies for 
experimental biology 
suk y oh an associate professor of nutrition and colleagues 
at the university of utah added fish oil to chicken feed hens that 
ate the oilenriched feed for eight weeks laid eggs that reduced 
blood pressure and blood fats in a group of 12 people and unlike 
regular eggs didnt raise cholesterol levels 
the eggs taste and smell like fish but oh said that can 
probably be avoided by feeding hens deodorized fish oil 
if ohs preliminary findings are confirmed in a larger study 
consumption of such eggs will not increase the risk of developing 
coronary heart disease no matter how many are consumed he said 
oh said fish oilenriched eggs could join existing 
lowcholesterol egg substitutes in markets by summer 1989 but 
because of the price of fish oil the eggs would probably cost 
about 40 percent more than regular eggs 
the american heart association recommends people eat no more 
than 300 milligrams of cholesterol daily because high levels of the 
fatlike substance in blood are linked to increased risk of 
hardening of the arteries heart attacks and strokes a regular egg 
averages 274 milligrams of cholesterol 
in the other study nutritional sciences professor charles elson 
and colleagues at the university of wisconsin found that daily 
consumption of 140milligram capsules of lemongrass oil a spice 
common in thai food reduced blood cholesterol more than 10 percent 
in more than onethird of a small group of people with unhealthy 
high levels 
elson now is testing other foods containing chemicals called 
isoprenoids to learn if they also can inhibit the bodys formation 
of cholesterol from simpler fats 
were looking in beer wine citrus peel and oats he said 
weve found a compound in barley any green plant has similar 
compounds and some also are in milk if were correct we could 
create a diet composed of a variety of foods containing factors 
that work together to control cholesterol 
for now people should eat a wide variety of vegetables and 
fruits to have ready access to compounds that will help block or 
reduce cholesterol synthesis in the body elson said 
oh and his colleagues fed hens fish oilenriched chicken feed 
because the oil contains omega3 fatty acids previous studies 
suggest people who consume coldwater fish which contain omega3 
fatty acids enjoy a lower risk of heart attack and stroke 
in ohs study 12 healthy people with normal blood levels of 
cholesterol and triglycerides fatty substances that also 
contribute to heart disease were divided into two groups each 
person ate four eggs daily for eight weeks 
the first group ate fish oilenriched eggs for the first four

an iranian attack on a united arab 
emirates offshore oil field in the persian gulf has shut it down 
for at least two months the middle east economic survey said 
the weekly newsletter said the mubarak oil field had been 
producing between 8000 and 9000 barrels of oil a day during 
recent months 
the iranian naval attack on april 18 came after us forces 
destroyed two iranian oil platforms in the gulf in retaliation for 
irans alleged sowing of a mine that damaged a us warship the 
previous week 
gulfbased shipping executives were puzzled by the attack 
because iran receives half the net revenues from the oil field

north carolina today and in ohio they are expected to nominate 
sen howard metzenbaum for a third term pitting him against 
clevelands republican mayor george voinovich in november 
presidential primaries are being held in ohio and indiana and 
in washington dc 
north carolina did its presidential primary voting as part of 
the super tuesday on march 8 
with indianas gop gov robert orr forced by law to retire after 
two terms the governors race is viewed by democrats as a golden 
opportunity to recapture an office they have not held in 20 years 
secretary of state evan bayh 32yearold son of former sen 
birch bayh is the leading contender opposed only by former kokomo 
mayor stephen j daily senate minority leader frank l obannons 
name was put on the democratic ballot by bayhs campaign when it 
appeared bayh might be held in violation of the states fiveyear 
residency requirement but the state supreme court ruled last week 
that bayh could run 
lt gov john m mutz who is the only republican candidate has 
pointed to his own experience as a 20year veteran of the general 
assembly and executive branch and tried to make an issue of bayhs 
age 
were not talking about electing somebody class president 
here said mutz 52 
age is not relevant countered bayh its ability its 
ideas its where you hope to lead indiana 
indiana also has a senate race this year with republican sen 
richard g lugar unopposed for nomination to a third term the lone 
democratic contender is indianapolis attorney jack wickes formerly 
with gary harts campaign staff 
in north carolina gov jim martin is unopposed for renomination 
as he tries to become the first republican in the state to serve 
consecutive terms as governor this century 
leading a field of five democrats is lt gov bob jordan who

take credit for democrats accomplishments 
north carolina doesnt need a governor who is content to be a 
passenger or a backseat driver jordan said in january after 
driving an 18wheel truck from his family lumberyard in mount 
gilead to raleigh to dramatize his handson management style 
opposing jordan are billy martin a servicestation employee not 
related to the governor bruce friedman an antinuclear activist

ku klux klan in 1987 but remains sympathetic to some of its causes 
and james t lloyd of salisbury 
in ohios senate race the popular voinovich is unopposed on the 
gop side while metzenbaum is heavily favored over ralph applegate 
a political newcomer from columbus who has hardly been heard from 
since filing in february 
the fall campaign promises to be a highspending one with 
federal election commission reports showing that metzenbaum had 
raised 44 million as of march 31 thats the thirdhighest amount 
of any incumbent senator seeking reelection this year 
voinovich who raised 29 million by the same date had 
initially criticized his rival for collecting money out of state 
but he recently announced his own fundraising drive in major 
cities around the country 
ohio also two congressional races of note gop rep delbert 
latta is retiring in rural northwest ohio and the republican 
candidates include his attorney son robert state senate president 
paul gillmor of port clinton and rex damschroder of fremont

the citys finest probably wont win any fashion 
contests with a new uniform theyre testing but at least they 
wont have to shine their shoes crease their pants or polish their 
gunbelt buckles 
its quite different but it doesnt look that different 
police commissioner benjamin ward said monday as two 
nervouslooking police officers modeled the new threads 
the new uniform will be worn by 135 officers citywide for the 
next year if it passes final inspection the duty jacket 
raincoat shirt trousers gunbelt and shoes will become mandatory 
for the citys 27000 police officers 
the changes reflect new yorks busy lifestyle that calls for 
minimal upkeep and includes machine washable shirts pants with a 
permanent crease shoes that dont need to be shined and a gunbelt 
with a nontarnish buckle 
the new jacket a lightweight polywool blend has four 
goldplated buttons to give it the appearance of a dress coat but 
is actually closed by a concealed plastic zipper with a velcro 
closure 
you dont lose the buttons and yet you have the traditional 
appearance of the buttons ward said approvingly 
the most visible change is the placement of the police 
department patch on both sleeves of the duty jacket raincoat and 
shirts currently officers wear the patch only on their right 
shoulders 
on the old uniform if you happened to be facing the wrong 
way you wouldnt know whether this was a police officer or a 
private security guard in a dark suit ward said 
as usual convenience doesnt come cheap the new uniform costs 
476 versus the 350 for the current uniform 
this is a great improvement over what i wore ward said 
recalling that his leather uniform coat was heavy and it wasnt 
warm

technique doesnt count for much when 
throwing fish but kissing may help says the winner of the fourth 
annual interstate mullet toss 
steve king of pensacola fla won the mens division sunday by 
tossing a mullet 111 feet 7 inches across the state line from 
florida to alabama 
we bought a couple of mullet last week king said we 
tried to make them spiral and be aerodynamic but it didnt work 
you just gotta grab it and throw it 
a day earlier in the preliminaries king got off a toss of 171 
feet 6 inches about 30 feet farther than the record set in 1986 
but it wont go into the record books because only final round 
throws qualify 
i know what happened king said after his shorter toss into 
a strong head wind i didnt kiss the mullet today yesterday 
i kissed him that helps 
vickie andrews of thomasville won the womens competition with a 
toss of 72 feet 1 inch 
i throw one every day ms andrews said the first thing i 
do when i get up is throw a mullet 
about 200 people attended the competition as part of the greater 
gulf coast beach party 
mullet are about 8 to 10 inches long and popular for fish fries 
along the florida panhandle and alabama coast appropriately 
enough mullet are related to flying fish

researchers seeking to cure crippling 
diseases like arthritis and multiple sclerosis in humans say 
theyve taken an early important step by isolating the gene that 
causes a form of arthritis in mice 
we are on the way to finding the cure for this type of 
arthritis in mice tariq m haqqi a molecular biologist at the 
mayo clinic in rochester minn said monday 
if the same kinds of arthritiscausing genes or inherited 
blueprints can be identified in humans we are one step closer 
to the cure and prevention of human rheumatoid arthritis and other 
human autoimmune diseases in which the body apparently is 
attacked by its own diseasefighting immune system haqqi said 
discovery of the gene vb6 that causes mouse arthritis was 
outlined by haqqi during the annual meeting of the federation of 
american societies for experimental biology which drew 22000 
scientists and exhibitors 
the discovery is very exciting because it is the first time 
scientists have isolated a gene that causes arthritis said dr c 
garrison fathman an immunologistrheumatologist at stanford 
university 
but he said it still will take scientists years to find a cure 
for rheumatoid arthritis which afflicts 7 million americans or 
any of the other 100 forms of arthritis and related diseases such 
as lupus multiple sclerosis and juvenile or insulindependent 
diabetes 
fathman recently used what are called monoclonal antibodies 
proteins made in the laboratory to target specific types of cells 
to attack t cells a type of white blood cell in the immune system 
that cause diabetes in mice the mice were cured he reported 
friday in the journal science 
haqqi is now trying to cure mice of arthritis by using other 
tailormade monoclonal antibodies to attack the t cells responsible 
for that disease without harming other white blood cells which are 
needed to defend the body against infection 
t cells normally help fight infection by recognizing an invading 
germ or foreign substance and then triggering production of 
antibodies to combat them but bacterial and viral infections also 
can trigger autoimmune diseases 
haqqi and his colleagues identified and isolated the gene that 
codes for production of a certain receptor on the surface of t 
cells in mice 
haqqi said this receptor causes the t cells to lose their 
ability to distinguish foreign collagen or connective tissue from 
the collagen naturally found in cartilage tendon and skin 
so the t cells attack collagen in cartilage in the mices 
joints causing the inflammation swelling and pain known as 
arthritis 
scientists from the howard hughes medical institute at 
washington university in st louis and from the university of 
tennessee in memphis also worked on the study in which mice 
developed arthritis when injected with collagen from cows the 
disease is similar to crippling rheumatoid arthritis in humans 
if researchers can identify the genes for human t cell receptors 
that go awry to cause human arthritis and other autoimmune 
diseases then we can cure the disease and prevent it by 
producing monoclonal antibodies to attack the culprit t cells while 
leaving other white blood cells unharmed haqqi said 
but he cautioned the antibody that works in mice may not 
work in humans so well have to find the antibody that works in 
humans 
fathman agreed saying different monoclonal antibodies would be 
needed not only for every form of arthritis and autoimmune 
disease but possibly for each individual human

pharmaceutical co received a permit to manufacture and export 
azidothymidine azt 
but domestic sales of the drug will not be allowed until 
clinical tests are completed the ministry said 
the drug first developed in britain as an anticancer drug can 
lengthen the lives of patients suffering from acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome by restraining development of the virus that 
causes the disease 
export plans call for producing the drug at about half the 
international price of 155 for 100 milligrams officials said 
exports to the united states and western europe are expected to

the president of the vietnam veterans memorial 
fund said today that scratches found in the memorial one 
resembling a swastika appear to be random vandalism and not the 
work of someone trying to make a political statement 
it looks like the random defacement that happens to memorials 
in washington from time to time said jan scruggs the memorial 
has had about 24 million visitors and only one bad egg 
the vandalism is the first since the memorial opened in 1982 
national park service officials said monday the 493foot granite 
wall inscribed with 58156 names of those killed in the southeast 
asian conflict has become the most visited monument in the nations 
capital 
the wall itself has such great respect that we have never had 
problems with damage said bill ruback superintendent of 
national parks in downtown washington it had to be someone crazy 
to do this 
ruback said he believed the marks were an act of vandalism 
someone stood here and did this on purpose he said noting 
that hard objects such as cameras and womens purses often strike 
the wall without causing any damage 
the scratches about eight inches long were discovered on a 
center panel and on a panel near the east end of the memorial early 
last month 
we worried about vandalism from the time we began to talk 
about a memorial said scruggs head of the organization that 
raised money to build the memorial 
scruggs said he has contacted a specialist in polished surfaces 
to come to inspect the scratches which he said are not deep any 
necessary repairs will be the responsibility of both the fund and 
the federal government said scruggs 
scruggs said he will also offer a 1000 reward for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever committed the 
vandalism

a proposed bypass road in eastern england has 
caused a battle between conservationists who want to save the 
habitat of a rare moth and people who want heavy traffic diverted 
from their village 
six hundred residents from the village of dersingham marched 1 
miles on monday to queen elizabeth iis sandringham estate in 
norfolk to demand that work begin on the bypass which they first 
called for 25 years ago 
after pressure from conservationists environment secretary 
nicholas ridley said he would consider revoking planning permission 
for the bypass which would cut through a bog on the royal estate 
that is home to the moth 
a group called the nature conservancy council said the road 
could wipe out the moth choristoneura lafauryana by destroying 
the bog where it breeds 
but the demonstrators doubt there are any moths left 
a big survey by the nature conservancy council led to nothing 
they couldnt even find the damn moth said one marcher james

an engineer studying the sunken civil war ship 
uss monitor says it could cost 20 million to raise the ironclad 
vessel from its 125yearold grave off north carolina 
but james jenkins a corrosion and metallurgical engineer with 
the navy civil engineering laboratory in port hueneme calif also 
said that federal officials are uncertain whether to raise the ship 
personally id like to make sure anything done there is done 
carefully so we dont waste the 120 years that its been down 
there jenkins said monday at the offshore technology conference 
here we really dont know today what could or should be done 
already 3 million has been spent on research and estimates of 
costs to raise the ship range from 10 million to 20 million he 
said 
there are major structural components like the armored deck 
the turret the guns the engine and the boilers that appear to be 
relatively intact and probably could be retrieved he said 
on new years eve 1862 the uss monitor sank in a storm off cape 
hatteras 
nine months earlier on march 9 1862 it battled the 
confederate vessel merrimack to a draw in the first combat between 
two ironclad ships neither ship was able to inflict serious damage 
on the other in the battle which occurred at hampton roads off 
virginia 
the merrimack renamed the virginia by the confederates was 
scuttled two months later when southern forces abandoned the 
norfolk navy yard the merrimack was discovered in 1910 its 
armored plates retrieved and sold as souvenirs jenkins said 
we dont want that to happen to the monitor to have pieces of 
it on the end of keychains he said we dont want people going 
in and we dont want souvenir hunters a la the titanic 
the monitor suffered extensive damage while being depthcharged 
during world war ii when it mistakenly was believed to be a german 
submarine it was not until 1973 that duke university researchers 
said they believed the wreck was the monitor photographs made two 
years later confirmed that 
last year jenkins coordinated a corrosion survey of the 
monitor using norwegianmade electronic probes attached to 
remotecontrolled underwater gear the probes normally are used to 
test the corrosion of offshore drilling rigs and the investigation 
of the monitor marked one of the first times oilfield technology 
was applied to marine archeology he said 
the monitor is in about 230 feet of water upside down with its 
twogun turret made of footthick wrought iron and weighing 120 
tons supporting about 90 feet of the deck above the sea floor 
although corrosion has set in jenkins said its important to 
note that less than onehalf inch of material has been lost 
corrosion rates tend to drop over long periods of time he 
said 
as an engineer jenkins said the wreck is significant because it 
provides corrosion data over 120 years 
the wreck in 1975 was designated the first national marine 
sanctuary 
jenkins said technology exists to preserve what it left of the 
ship or the debris around the vessel could be retrieved or 
officials can take no action at all 
we have a lot more plans than money he said its value is 
as a fingerprint of society and a fingerprint of shipbuilding in 
the 1860s

opposition party leaders said they 
were alarmed by reports of a us deal that would force gen manuel 
antonio noriega to resign as head of the military but allow him to 
remain in panama 
in another development an official of the bilateral commission 
that runs the panama canal said the waterway continues to do a 
thriving business despite the nations protracted economic and 
political crisis 
the opposition leaders discussed the reported deal monday at 
what they called their first meeting since panamas crisis began 
nearly a year ago 
we met to discuss jointly the grave situation of our country 
and what we may do together to find a democratic solution for our 
country said ricardo arias calderon who held the twohour 
meeting at his home 
the opposition wants noriega the power behind the civilian 
government to resign as commander of the 15000member defense 
forces and leave the country 
the united states has imposed economic sanctions on panama 
designed to oust noriega and has called for him to leave panama 
some us political leaders say it would be a mistake if the united 
states backed off that stance 
the sanctions which have caused an economic crisis in panama 
were imposed after noriega was indicted in february on us drug 
trafficking charges 
following mondays meeting some of the opposition leaders said 
they were alarmed by reports of a deal that would allow noriega to 
remain in panama 
the leaders discussed everything that has to do with the 
serious crisis including the reported arrangement between 
washington and noriega said one source at the meeting who spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
us officials in washington have said noriega agreed to step 
down as commander of the defense forces but refused to leave 
panama treasury secretary james a baker said on sunday that us 
talks with noriega continued during the weekend and that progress 
is being made noriega denied on saturday he had reached any 
agreement with the united states 
sources in the opposition say their leaders are afraid the 
united states is bypassing them and ignoring promises to them they 
say if noriega quits but remains in panama he will continue to 
wield power through the defense forces he would continue to be a 
focus of controversy arias calderon said monday 
the christian democrats the second largest opposition party 
called mondays meeting also attending were representatives of the 
authentic panamanian party the republican party of ousted 
president eric arturo delvalle the liberal republican nationalist 
movement and factions of the liberal and labor parties the 
authentic panamanian party is the largest opposition party followed 
by the christian democrats 
delvalle was deposed feb 26 the day after he tried to fire 
noriega 
such concerns have not reduced traffic in the panama canal 
business is almost embarrassingly high said richard a 
wainio chief of economic research and market development for the 
panama canal commission he said on monday that the canal is 
running smoothly because neither the united states nor panama 
wants to jeopardize operation of the canal 
five americans and five panamanians make up the commission 
established under 1977 treaties that will turn the canal ove to 
panama at the end of 1999 
during the first five months of fiscal 1988 toll revenues came 
to 1436 million 46 million higher than anticipated 
wainio said he expects income to match expenses the rest of the 
year

oliver north used his first speech as a 
civilian to blast his critics while the rev jerry falwell 
compared norths criminal indictment to the persecution and 
crucifixion of jesus christ 
north a former marine lieutenant colonel who is accused of 
illegally diverting money from iranian arms deals to the nicaraguan 
contras delivered the commencement address monday at falwells 
liberty university 
hes already been convicted in much of the national media 
falwell told a cheering crowd of about 12000 hes already 
guilty the first questions always asked why are you having an 
indicted man to speak to the students of liberty university i 
said well we serve a savior who was indicted and convicted and 
crucified 
north told the crowd that he had asked his daughter to forgive 
his accusers and said he never intended to get caught in a 
political war between president reagan and congress 
from certain commentaries in the media it is clear that some 
believe once a man is accused hes branded forever north said 
well ive been accused of helping the brave young men and 
women of the nicaraguan resistance in their struggle for the very 
liberties we claim as birthright 
ive been accused of trying to rescue american hostages held 
captive and trying to prevent other terrorist attacks those 
accusations are not a brand they are a badge of honor 
the crowd chanted ollie ollie as north wearing a black 
and purple academic robe marched to the stage placed in front of a 
huge american flag in libertys baseball park he was given an 
honorary doctorate in the humanities 
conservatives seeking to draft north for virginias us senate 
seat being vacated by republican paul trible listened for clues 
that north might like the idea they thought they had one when 
north said we need a better congress 
that was a signal for all of us in the commonwealth of 
virginia to go at it said jamey r wheeler head of a committee 
seeking to draft north for the senate 
north whose retirement from the marine corps became effective 
this week told the students they should be grateful for the 
opportunities they have as american citizens 
as you leave liberty university you can be anything you want 
to be north said as your counterparts are graduated from the 
university of moscow they can be anything the state wants them to 
be 
while north addressed the audience peace activists staged an 
antinorth demonstration in downtown lynchburg 
also members of people for the american way came to liberty to 
hand out a statement saying they opposed falwells effort to get 
north pardoned 
falwell said monday he has collected 600000 of the 2 million 
signatures he wants for a petition calling on reagan to pardon 
north 
the issue isnt whether ollie north is innocent or guilty 
its whether the president and his staff are above the law said 
the groups president arthur j kropp

the number of white blood cells infected 
by the aids virus rises sharply in the year before virusinfected 
males actually develop the disease says a study that may lead to 
speedier treatment for aids victims 
while the existing test to detect the increase in aidsinfected 
cells is too timeconsuming and expensive for routine use the us 
centers for disease control is trying to develop a simpler test 
that could predict when an infected person will get fullblown 
aids said the cdcs janet nicholson 
such a test would help doctors decide when the benefits of 
giving patients certain toxic antiaids drugs outweigh the risks 
said dr paul volberding associate professor of medicine at the 
university of california san francisco and aids program director 
at san francisco general hospital 
if we knew that somebody was getting close to the point of 
developing aids we would want to treat the person at that point 
even if he hadnt developed fullblown aids he said 
nicholson the cdcs clinical immunology chief presented her 
findings monday during the annual meeting of the federation of 
american societies for experimental biology 
she and her colleagues spent three years regularly testing blood 
cells from 15 homosexual atlanta men who were infected by the virus 
and had chronic swelling of lymph glands but didnt suffer aids 
six of the 15 subsequently developed aids nicholson said 
she said in the year before those symptoms became apparent the 
six showed a 25fold increase in the number of aids virusinfected 
peripheral blood mononuclear cells a class of white blood cells 
if a simple test could show that someone infected with the virus 
soon will get aids doctors could better decide when to prescribe 
azt and antibiotics that prevent pneumocystis pneumonia and other 
infections that kill aids patients once the virus has crippled 
their immune systems volberding said azt or azidothymidine is 
believed to slow progression of aids 
from a scientific standpoint learning what a persons risk of 
developing aids is over time is a very important one he said 
but nicholson and volberding acknowledged that some 
aidsinfected people may not want to learn that they soon will 
develop disease symptoms 
nicholson said researchers previously knew that people infected 
with aids show reduced numbers of one type of diseasefighting 
white blood cell called t4helper cells while the infection 
progresses 
her study found that the number of helper cells decreases more 
quickly and the number of aidsinfected cells rises sharply in 
infected patients who go on to develop overt aids symptoms 
its not clear yet whether everyone who is infected will 
develop disease she said adding that her findings point the way 
toward determining which patients are likely to do so 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a 
virus that damages the bodys immune system leaving victims 
susceptible to death from infections and cancer 
the cdc estimates that 1 million to 15 million americans have 
been infected with the virus and of that total 20 percent to 30 
percent will develop aids by the end of 1991

the cocainesmuggling trial of reputed 
colombian drug lord carlos lehder rivas could go to the jury next 
week after his lawyers shocked the courtroom by resting their case 
without calling witnesses 
us district judge howell w melton scheduled closing arguments 
to begin next monday and attorneys estimated they could last up to 
three days 
the judge also denied a defense motion monday to sequester the

colombias medellin cartel believed to be responsible for 80 
percent of the cocaine smuggled into united states a bonanza 
worth 8 billion each year 
defense attorney edward r shohat stunned the courtroom monday 
when he announced the defense would rest without calling any 
witnesses to counter the 115 prosecution witnesses who testified 
during a 22week period he refused to discuss the move with 
reporters 
you could honestly say i looked surprised and stunned 
assistant us attorney ernst mueller said later the jury did not 
show any visible reaction 
stephen weinbaum an attorney for codefendant jack carlton 
reed also rested without calling any witnesses 
that tactic is used by defense attorneys to keep the 
sufficiency of the governments case at issue weinbaum said 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise reed 57 of san pedro calif is 
charged with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy 
if convicted of all 11 counts lehder could be sentenced to a 
maximum sentence of life plus 165 years reed would face a possible 
15 yearsentence

a former wedtech corp official says the 
exchairman of the scandalplagued defense contractor once 
suggested killing another official insured by the company for 15 
million 
but lawrence shorten testifying monday at the racketeering 
trial of rep mario biaggi dny and six others said he never 
took the suggested murder plot seriously 
shorten once wedtechs chief financial officer is one of four 
former company officials to plead guilty to state and federal 
charges and was the second to testify at the trial in exchange for 
leniency 
biaggi wedtech founder john mariotta and five others are 
accused of turning wedtech now in bankruptcy proceedings into a 
racketeering enterprise that made millions of dollars in payoffs to 
secure government contracts 
under crossexamination by the defense shorten admitted that 
after he and other wedtech executives forced mariotta out of the 
company in 1985 they kept paying premiums for a 15 million 
insurance policy on mariotta despite wedtechs financial problems 
shorten however denied that another wedtech executive anthony 
guariglia wanted to keep up the policy because it might come in 
handy 
but he did say that if john mariotta died the company could 
use the 15 million pressed mariotta attorney jeffrey glekel 
he did make that statement yes said shorten 
the witness said guariglia called him in late 1985 to talk about 
a conversation with thenwedtech chairman fred neuberger 
i think he said to the effect wait till you hear this one 
i said what he said freddie came up with the bright idea to 
knock off john mariotta 
i said to him you are not serious he says no i just 
thought youd want to know that freddie made that statement 
guariglia and neuberger are expected to testify for the 
government 
the defense has been trying to depict them and other former 
wedtech officials as liars and thieves who have admitted crimes far 
more serious than the ones biaggi and his codefendants are accused 
of 
mario moreno another one of the four cooperating wedtech 
officials testified earlier that neuberger suggested hiring an 
israeli hitman to kill mariotta 
shorten said neuberger often boasted of having connections with 
an israeli hitman 
he said he could take care of everything he could hire a 
consultant from israel but it had nothing to do with john 
mariotta it was more joking than anything else said shorten 
shorten said later that local teamsters officials suggested 
killing mariotta in march 1986 
they said it could be done for 50000 said shorten we 
rejected it out of hand that it was a crazy thought that we 
wouldnt get involved in anything like that 
moreno has testified that wedtech paid off teamsters officials 
for labor peace and that a union leader offered to eliminate 
mariotta because they were afraid he might spill the beans on 
the payoffs 
moreno also testified that most of the executives rejected the 
idea although he said neuberger complained they were acting like 
boy scouts

florida state university ordered a 
fraternity to disband for five years for a rape of a teenage 
student at the fraternity house and subsequent coverup officials 
said 
i hope what were doing sends out a message we do take this 
very seriously dean of students james hayes said monday the 
nature of the whole incident was so serious that to be responsible 
you have to take action 
university officials accepted a recommendation after a fourday 
hearing by an administrative hearing panel made up of a student 
faculty member and staff representative 
hayes announced the sanctions just 10 days after a strongly 
worded grand jury interim report urged university officials to 
crack down on pi kappa alpha fraternity where the woman was 
allegedly raped march 5 by two fraternity members 
the grand jury report issued last month said the 18yearold 
victim was raped by more than one person and left in a 
lifethreatening condition of intoxication she suffered several 
scratches and abrasions and had crude words and a fraternity symbol 
scrawled on her thighs 
other fraternity members allegedly tried to block the 
universitys investigation which led to the arrest of three men 
the question of not cooperating was a pretty serious one 
hayes said 
the fraternitys president brant byrd of belleair denied 
claims that the fraternity failed to cooperate 
i know that we cooperated with the fsu police from the 
beginning and well continue to byrd said 
the fraternity which has about 170 members has until may 15 to 
appeal the sanctions 
fraternity members daniel g oltarsh 23 of fort lauderdale and 
byron l stewart 21 of orlando were charged with sexual battery 
jason j mcpharlin 19 of plantation a pi kappa alpha member at 
auburn university was charged with being an accessory to a felony 
and failing to report a sexual battery 
oltarsh and stewart were freed on 10000 bond last week while 
mcpharlin was freed on 6000 bond 
the pi kappa alpha chapter at stetson university in deland 
about 250 miles southeast of tallahassee was suspended for one 
year by school officials last week following rape allegations no 
criminal charges were filed

the ailing mother of deposed 
president ferdinand marcos today slipped into semiconsciousness 
after asking president corazon aquino to allow her son to return as 
my dying wish 
there was no reaction from mrs aquino to the request of 
95yearold josefa edralinmarcos who was hospitalized sunday with 
pneumonia and diabetes the military chief hinted the armed forces 
command opposed a marcos return 
dr sergio brillantes director of the veterans medical center 
said mrs edralinmarcos condition had worsened in the past 24 
hours he said her kidneys were failing but that her blood pressure 
was too low for dialysis 
dona josefa marcos has deteriorated quite rapidly since 
yesterday brillantes told the associated press her level of 
consciousness is deteriorating she is semicomatose 
later brillantes told radio station dzxl that mrs 
edralinmarcos condition was very very bad and the prognosis is 
very poor at the moment 
mrs edralinmarcos stayed behind in february 1986 when a 
militarycivilian uprising drove her son to exile in hawaii and 
brought president aquino to power mrs aquino has refused to allow 
marcos to come back 
mrs aquinos staff said the presidential palace received a 
letter today from mrs edralinmarcos asking that her son be 
allowed to return to be with her in her final hours 
my end beckons me said the letter the text of which was 
released by the presidential palace i know i am about to render 
my own accounting with my maker i leave our world content 
my dying wish the one thing that will put a smile upon my 
lips when i leave this world is to see my ferdinand by my bedside 
as i say goodbye to all of you who have been part of my mundane 
existence 
may god bless you with all the compassion understanding and 
the undying love of a mother to her own child especially at the 
sunset hours my being pray grant me this wish as one mother to 
another for the love of all

edralinmarcos thumbprint and was written monday they said mrs 
aquino had not been shown the letter

edralinmarcos hospital room but dozens of marcos supporters 
jammed an adjacent room where they watched mrs edralinmarcos 
through a small window 
outside the hospital about 100 marcos supporters held a 
candlelight vigil and prayed for her recovery 
earlier brillantes said the patient was not responding to 
medication because of her advanced age he said the former 
presidents brother dr pacifico marcos and his sister mrs 
fortuna barba were at their mothers bedside 
in honolulu marcos spokesman gemmo trinidad said the former 
president was aware of his mothers condition 
mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos to come back saying his 
return would not be good for the country marcos supporters have 
been linked to several previous coup attempts 
marcos was not allowed to return for the funeral of his sister 
elizabeth keon who died in the philippines in december 1986 
military chief of staff gen renato de villa today said that if 
mrs edralinmarcos died the cabinet would be consulted on whether 
to allow the former president to attend the funeral 
we will have to assess at this point in time whether 
conditions in the past are still the same de villa told 
reporters we still have certainly a serious threat situation in 
the country coming from communist rebels and we dont want 
additional problems if its possible at this time

israeli security forces raided a palestinian 
newspaper and detained the managing editor police and newspaper 
officials said today 
hannah siniora editor of the arab and englishlanguage al fajr 
newspaper in east jerusalem sharply criticized the monday night 
raid it followed the closing monday of the palestinian weekly al 
awdah and was the latest in a series of measures taken against 
journalists 
i feel all these oppressive measures will backlash against the 
peace process he told the associated press today journalists 
apparently are being singled out for special attention 
a police official confirmed that israeli authorities carried out 
the raid and security sources said managing editor hatem abdul 
khader would be jailed for six months without trial under israeli 
emergency regulations the officials spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
since unrest began in the occupied territories dec 8 israeli 
authorities have shut two propalestinian newspapers and a press 
agency arrested 22 reporters most of them arabs and lifted the 
credentials of two american correspondents 
the authorities said they closed al awdah the only 
englishlanguage weekly magazine published in east jerusalem 
because it received funding from terrorist organizations the 
magazines publisher ibrahim karaeen denied the charge 
siniora said it was not clear why al fajrs managing editor was 
detained 
we are making inquiries with our lawyers today about what 
actions to take siniora said 
the army also has periodically closed large areas of the 
occupied territories to journalists and empowered local commanders 
to chase them from the scene of trouble spots 
israeli officials have blamed television cameras for stoking the 
fires of the uprising and accused the press of maintaining a double 
standard taking israel to task for actions that are overlooked 
elsewhere in the world 
a sort of paranoia has developed about the media said yariv 
beneliezer a professor of film and communications at telaviv 
university soldiers always ask why is the media against us 
and students ask the same question 
prime minister yitzhak shamirs spokesman avi pazner 
acknowledged israelis feel resentment toward the media 
the media have given us the short end of the stick they 
didnt tell the whole of the israeli side of the story pazner 
said no wonder there is resentment 
he stressed however that israel has made no changes in its 
policy of freedom of the press 
we scrupulously maintain our principle of safeguarding the 
freedom of the press in the country pazner said there are 
very few countries in the world that would allow this kind of 
freedom in the situation we have been in during the last months 
mondays actions followed the sixmonth closure in march of al 
awdahs sister organization the englishlanguage palestine press 
service a key source of information on the occupied territories 
israel also shut down a leftwing proarab israeli newspaper 
derech hanitzotz the press service and derech hanitzotz were 
charged with maintaining links with terror organizations 
since its february closing four editors of the israeli 
newspaper including three israelis have been arrested and accused 
of membership in guerrilla groups 
at least 18 palestinian journalists are in jail many held under 
administrative detention orders which allow imprisonment for up to 
six months without trial according to a representative of the arab 
journalists association who asked not to be identified for fear of 
reprisals 
israel has also periodically barred the distribution of 
arabiclanguage newspapers in the occupied territories 
last month the government suspended the press credentials of 
foreign correspondents glenn frankel of the washington post and 
martin fletcher of nbc news after they published details of the 
assassination of a plo leader without submitting them to military 
censorship 
since the uprising began the foreign press association which 
represents 200 foreign journalists working in israel has received 
between 100 and 150 complaints of harassment and physical attacks 
by israeli troops and jewish settlers said robert slater the 
groups chairman 
there is a feeling among many people that the media should be 
taken out of the territories that if you dont see it it isnt 
there beneliezer said

a communist party member harshly criticized his 
comrades in a letter to pravda saying their careerist ambitions 
and conformity made the party into a mere instrument of josef 
stalin and his successors 
the letter from a government official v selivanov to the 
party daily differed markedly from the usual criticism now seen of 
the soviet past which blames former party leaders themselves for 
excesses or departures from marxistleninist orthodoxy 
selivanov deputy chief of administration at the ministry of the 
aviation industry criticized the 19million member party itself 
and its role in his countrys political life since the death of 
vladimir i lenin in 1924 
selivanov a party member since 1972 wrote the party is the 
mind honor and conscience of our epoch those words of vi 
lenin unfortunately cannot be applied to all members of our party 
at the current time 
his letter frontpaged in pravdas monday editions appeared the 
day after may day the workers holiday and its prominent place was 
clearly designed to give its contents maximum exposure 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev has told party members to 
back his ambitious program for perestroika or social and 
economic restructuring or get out of the way for those who do he 
is expected to use a party conference on june 28 to set his stamp 
even more firmly on the party which holds the monopoly on soviet 
political power 
the main question of perestroika is the democratization of 
society and this is not feasible without democratization of the 
party selivanov wrote in this letter to that end he called for 
reviewing each communists past performance to see whether 
membership should be extended or revoked 
the nations criminal code now being rewritten should be 
modified so communists who commit crimes get a more severe sentence 
than nonparty members he said party leaders up to the level of 
regional chief should be elected for a set term by secret ballot 
he said top local party officials are now appointed by moscow and 
the appointment ratified by a ritual vote 
gorbachev himself floated the idea of a more democratic 
selection process for local party officials at the party central 
committees meeting in january 1987 the idea was not repeated in 
the central committees report indicating a defeat for gorbachev 
but it has resurfaced in speeches by soviet officials 
analyzing the often troubled role of the party during 70 years 
of soviet history selivanov wrote that during the internecine 
ideological battles of the late 1920s and 1930s the party 
leadership pursued unity at any price 
the result he said was the spread of the opinion that the 
gensec party general secretary is always right that his speeches 
are the truth down to the last detail it is only necessary to 
correctly quote the leader 
during their tenures as party leader stalin nikita s 
khrushchev and leonid i brezhnev all had no intention of modifying 
the party structures that concentrated so much power in their 
hands selivanov wrote 
for many communists and their families the careers awards 
benefits and contacts with influential people they could obtain 
from their party membership became the chief goals in their lives 
he said 
in the 1970s when brezhnev was in power selivanov said some 
people told him that having intelligence and a conscience was 
incompatible with being a member of the communist party

pfister spokesman for the us pacific command said the team 
included an anthropologist experienced in identifying human remains 
and two weapons disposal experts in case any live munitions 
remained at the site 
the team is from the us joint casualty resolution center and 
the army central identification laboratory honolulubased agencies 
entrusted with resolving the fates of americans missing in action 
from the vietnam war the war ended in 1975 with the defeat of the 
usbacked south vietnam government 
the us team led by lt col joe harvey the resolution center 
commander will be working with officials from laos defense and 
foreign ministries pfister said 
the savannakhet province is in the southern panhandle area 
between thailand and vietnam the crash site is 95 miles east of 
the city of savannakhet 
pfister said the remains of 11 missing americans were recovered 
in the first joint excavation in the communist country in 1985 and 
eight others in a 1986 project 
on previous excavations the workers went down on their hands 
and knees to dig out plane wreckage and sift for bone fragments 
with fine metal screens a number of unexploded shells were found 
at savannakhet the americans hope to resolve the fates of two 
soldiers reported missing after heavy ground fire struck the mohawk 
march 15 1966 
pfister said another us aircraft on that mission reported that 
one crewman parachuted out but landed in the area where the plane 
crashed 
us military experts said they saw no trace of remains during a 
preliminary inspection of the site last week serial numbers found 
on some wreckage were confirmed by the aircraft manufacturer the 
grumman corp as belonging to an ov1a mohawk 
details of the mohawks mission were not available but a number 
of us planes were shot down in eastern laos while trying to 
disrupt traffic on the ho chi minh trail which north vietnamese 
communists used to bring men and supplies into south vietnam 
laos agreed in august 1987 to devote more effort to the mia 
issue after the united states pledged to respond to its calls for 
humanitarian assistance

south africa cuba and angola today began 
ussponsored negotiations aimed at the withdrawal of foreign 
troops from the civil war in angola the us embassy said 
the embassy said the scheduled twoday talks had begun but 
refused to disclose where representatives are meeting in london 
the british foreign office said the nations also would discuss 
independence for southwest africa or namibia which south africa 
controls 
the talks come after an eightyear us effort to secure the 
withdrawal of 40000 cuban troops sent in 1975 to defend angolas 
marxist government against prowestern rebels 
chester crocker us assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs led the american delegation to the negotiations 
cuba was to be represented by its foreign minister raul roa 
kouri and angolas foreign minister alfonso van dunem also was 
to attend 
south africa sent a delegation headed by a neil van heerden 
director general of the department of foreign affairs 
crocker made no comment before the talks they were announced on 
friday in a brief british statement after crocker conferred in 
london with soviet deputy foreign minister anatoly adamishin 
adamishin told a news conference on friday that moscow supported 
the political dynamism behind the talks 
south african troops are in angola to attack bases of the south 
west africa peoples organization which seeks independence for 
southwest africa and to support the angolan rebels known as the 
national union for the total independence of angola 
south africa acknowledges up to 3000 troops in southern angola 
while angola says there are 9000 south africans there backed by 
heavy artillery 
in return for a cuban withdrawal angola and the soviet union 
want south africa to give namibia independence as demanded in a 
1966 un resolution 
the british foreign office said the talks will cover both the 
troop withdrawals and independence for namibia 
but the exclusion of namibian and angolan rebels appeared to 
indicate the emphasis will be on getting the south africans and 
cubans out of angola rather than namibian independence 
previous attempts at settlement have foundered partly on the 
reagan administrations demand that cuban troops leave before 
namibia becomes independent president pw botha of south africa 
repeated that demand in johannesburg on monday 
in recent months the south africans and cubans have been bogged 
down in heavy fighting around the strategic southeastern city of 
cuito cuanavale 
the war is a heavy burden on the already strapped angolan 
economy and the cubans have sustained high but undisclosed 
losses 
south africa acknowledges that more than 50 of its troops have 
been killed in angola since september

a judge said he was sending a warning to 
landlords when he sentenced a russian emigre violinist to 15 
years to life in prison for hiring arsonists to burn an occupied 
apartment house he owned 
the landlord gregory gelman 39 who has performed at carnegie 
hall insisted at his sentencing monday that he was innocent 
the truth did not come out at trial people lied under oath 
gelman protested when state supreme court justice jeffrey atlas 
sentenced him 
gelmans lawyer irving cohen asked the judge for leniency and 
said his client had been frustrated and financially hobbled by the 
complexities of the citys housing laws gelman who came to this 
country 10 years ago is a graduate of the juilliard school of 
music 
gelman married and the father of a 2yearold daughter was 
unable to make an adequate living at his profession according to 
cohen so he became a landlord he owns four buildings 
atlas who heard gelmans twomonth trial without a jury told 
the defendant that he convicted him only after finding him guilty 
beyond a reasonable doubt the judge also said he could not believe 
gelmans assertion that virtually every prosecution witness had 
lied 
the judge said the sentence imposed under a recently enacted 
arsonforprofit law should be a warning to landlords that 
their financial problems will not be solved by burning down their 
buildings 
atlas convicted gelman on oct 6 of firstdegree arson 
seconddegree conspiracy and firstdegree reckless endangerment for 
torching his fivestory building in the chelsea section of 
manhattan on feb 24 1986 while a rent strike was on 
assistant district attorney suzanne flamm said gelman wanted to 
burn the 15 tenants out so he could collect 250000 in insurance 
money and then rent to tenants who would not be covered by rent 
control or rent stabilization laws 
gelman hired four men to torch the building but two were 
seriously burned when the 40 gallons of gasoline they had brought 
into the building ignited the four pleaded guilty to thirddegree 
arson and are awaiting sentencing 
the buildings occupants escaped the blaze without injuries and 
moved back into their apartment after repairs were made 
ms flamm observing that the value of gelmans building 
increased after he bought it said he could have made a handsome 
profit without arson but profit was not enough 
gelman blamed the tenants for his troubles the tenants did 
not pay for two years he said in new york being a landlord 
you can never win

two fuselage panels on an aloha airlines 
jetliner that ripped open at 24000 feet had several rivets showing 
signs of cracking but officials are not sure if the cracks were 
present before the accident 
more electronic tests of rivets along a key strip of the planes 
structure were scheduled for today as investigators near the end of 
their field work joseph nall a member of the national 
transportation safety board said monday 
a 20foot section of the boeing 737s upper fuselage ripped off 
as it flew across the hawaiian islands on thursday killing a 
flight attendant and injuring 61 of the 89 passengers 
tests were done on 760 rivets and 30 were found cracked he said 
none of the bad rivets were next to each other and they were 
randomly scattered along the length of the aircraft he said 
in normal maintenance rivets usually are checked visually for 
cracks resulting from metal fatigue and a focus of the 
investigation will be whether that method is adequate nall said 
the pilot of alohas flight 243 capt robert schornstheimer 
and copilot mimi tompkins returned to maui from honolulu on 
monday to look at the crippled plane they managed to land 
they had not seen the floor beams and were just as amazed as 
the rest of us our investigators have been scratching their heads 
that the aircraft held itself together nall said 
nall said he hopes the accident forces the airline industry to 
reassess its maintenance methods and take another look at high 
cycle aircraft meaning older heavily used planes 
the federal aviation administration has ordered the oldest 
versions of the boeing 737s not to fly above 23000 feet 
meanwhile family members friends and hundreds of fellow 
workers at aloha airlines gathered in a hangar at honolulu 
international airport on monday for a memorial service for missing 
flight attendant clarabelle cb lansing 57 who was swept 
out of the plane when it tore open 
seven injured passengers remained hositalized in maui memorial 
hospital in stable condition according to a nursing supervisor

the soviet union could limit terms 
of office of highranking officials and develop a twoparty system 
in the near future a panel of soviet officials said during a 
conference on usussr relations 
american participants at mondays conference appeared skeptical 
upon hearing those and other statements from their russian 
counterparts who outlined plans to revitalize soviet society after 
what they called 10 years of stagnation 
we are only in the beginning of the process said nikolai 
shislin a member of the central committee of the communist party 
the soviet unions only political party 
in five seven 10 years i dont know how many parties 
there might be he said 
id like to see more evidence said george kessinger 
president of goodwill industries of orange county he said hed 
like to visit the soviet union to see such changes for himself 
if half of what they say is true theres an amazing thing 
going on said kessinger 
sergei plekhanov deputy director of the soviet institute for 
usa and candada studies said a greater separation of power is part 
of the goal 
we are talking about introducing the rule of law in the soviet 
union he said but do we want to turn into a litigious society 
we want the judiciary empowered to pass judgment on laws 
and a legislature with more independence plekhanov said but 
do we want to create a class of professional politicians 
the panel discussion was one of many events at the annual 
weeklong conference here which is now in its 28th year it brings 
together experts on american and soviet affairs 
in june the central committee will hold a party conference and 
will consider many new laws to promote change and create what 
shislin called a state of citizens rights 
one issue will be rules to promote rotation in the party he 
said including limiting the general secretariat to two or three 
5year terms 
alexander kislov a political scientist with the soviet academy 
of sciences said such a system is necessary because we have to 
get rid of the people who are afraid of change

service lines although the report did not detail costs charged for 
calls on the states widearea bulkcalling service

solidarity chief lech walesa today told 
thousands of cheering workers at the lenin shipyard that they must 
find another union leader as a strike took hold at the birthplace 
of the outlawed labor federation 
strike leaders said 80 percent of the 12000 workers had dropped 
their tools 
the yards giant cranes were idle and a large poster at the 
gate listed the strikers demands higher pay reinstatement of 
solidarity nationwide release of political prisoners and 
reinstatement of fired activists 
thousands of workers gathered in the factorys courtyard and 
perched on rooftops and fences heard walesas speech 
we dont want to be the beggars of europe and of the world 
walesa told the shipyard workers as he endorsed the strike that 
began monday 
walesa who headed the august 1980 strike at the shipyard that 
gave rise to the east blocs first independent labor movement 
received a loud cheer from the workers when he entered the yard 
this morning 
the 44yearold electrician had been on sick leave this week 
complaining of back pains and low blood sugar 
walesa told workers that polands labor struggle had exhausted 
him 
i am not your leader i am tired you have to find for 
yourself a new walesa he said 
he also told the workers they were taking up the same cause he 
fought for in 1980 
we lost eight years he said speaking through a loudspeaker 
here in the birthplace of solidarity i state to the 
authorities that they are deepening the losses they are forcing 
solidarity to lead the nation onto the road to reforms said 
walesa winner of the 1983 nobel peace prize 
the work stoppage at the shipyard was at least the fourth strike 
in communist poland in a week and contributed to the worst wave of 
labor unrest since the governments december 1981 military 
crackdown on solidarity 
in wroclaw today workers at a railroad car plant stopped 
production for about an hour and a bitter strike at the lenin 
steelworks in southern poland entered its eighth day 
about 1000 workers laid down their tools for several hours at 
the pafawag railroad car plant in wroclaw said solidarity 
spokeswoman barbara labuda but they resumed work after a promise 
for talks with management government spokesman jerzy urban 
confirmed the stoppage 
alojzy szablewski 62 a 36year veteran of the shipyard who led 
a strike at the lenin shipyard when martial law was imposed in 
december 1981 has emerged as the leader of the strike committee 
the nation has to believe somebody it will believe only 
solidarity szablewski said in a speech today at the shipyard 
gate 
walesa supports us szablewski told the strikers we 
listen to him and follow his advice 
walesa endorsed the strike when it began monday but he stayed 
off the local strike committee to coordinate solidarity activities 
nationwide activists said 
strikers slept outside in the shipyard overnight and police 
detachments roamed the city but were not near the shipyard gate 
when the strike began monday police surrounded the shipyard 
and authorities reportedly rounded up regional solidarity leaders 
nevertheless solidarity adviser jack kuron said management had 
agreed to talk today to the shipyards newly formed strike 
committee 
a spokesman for the shipyard was unavailable today and a 
secretary said shipyard director czeslaw tolwinski was in a meeting 
the news of the strike heartened the steelworkers in 
southeastern poland 
we feel better now said jan ciesielski a member of the 
steel strike committee at the lenin steel works in nowa huta 
outside krakow 
a solidarity communique signed by walesa and issued late monday 
said a strike wave is covering the country they are not just 
local conflicts they are across poland because the cause is the 
economic crisis and the lack of convincing reform policies that 
would offer prospects for the future 
workers want pay raises of up to 60 percent because prices have 
risen about 40 percent this year due to reductions in government 
subsidies 
kuron said police arrested nine regional representatives on the 
13member solidarity national executive commission bogdan lis a 
gdansk solidarity leader was detained said solidaritys chaplain 
the rev henryk jankowski 
polands latest labor trouble began april 25 with a wildcat 
action by transit workers in bydgoszcz it was settled the same day 
with pay raises of at least 50 percent thousands of workers at the 
stalowa wola heavy machinery plant struck friday and ended the 
action saturday after promises of higher pay 
about half the 3500 workers at the dolmel electronics plant in 
wroclaw southwestern poland stopped work monday josef pinior a 
solidarity leader said the job action ended when management 
promised a raise

entering his third month as postmaster 
general anthony m frank today shook up the management of the 
postal service with a series of personnel shifts 
frank named two associate postmasters general kenneth j 
hunter to supervise technology and operations and edward e 
horgan jr to handle international affairs 
in addition consumer advocate ann robinsons department was 
expanded to include supervision of measuring the performance of the 
mail service and mitchell h gordon was placed in charge of 
administrative services he was promoted from marketing and 
communications 
frank who had been known as an innovative manager in the 
banking business before taking over the postal job also announced 
that he was shifting the postal services planning operations to 
report directly to him and separating them from the finance 
operation 
also at todays meeting of the postal services board of 
governors it was announced that the agency had rejected a 
recommendation for lower postage on preprinted return envelopes 
the independent postal rate commission had recommended cutting 
prices for items such as utility bills that are mailed back to post 
office boxes the governors concluded however that most of the 
savings in such a case is achieved by the use of a post office box 
rather than the preprinted envelope and they felt it would be 
unfair to offer lower postage to some letters going to post office 
boxes but not to all 
the postal service announced that it had suffered a loss of 635 
million for the accounting period from dec 19 to march 11 the 
postal service had anticipated a lost of 586 million for that 
period higher postage rates intended to put the service back in 
the black took effect april 3

ousted moscow communist party boss boris n 
yelstin today said the soviet leadership cannot afford to 
disappoint the nation in the application of its reform campaign 
this hope must not be deceived or then it will not be easy to 
restore faith to the people to elevate them to great tasks 
yeltsin told the daily stroitelnaya gazeta construction newspaper 
in an interview 
yeltsin 57 once considered a protege of soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev was fired as moscow party chief nov 11 after 
criticizing the slow pace of reform and the partys style of 
leadership at a party meeting 
one week after his ouster yeltsin was named first deputy 
chairman of the state construction committee a government job that 
carries the rank of minister but that is clearly inferior to the 
post of moscow party boss 
stoitelnaya gazeta sought yeltsins comments in connection with 
a frontpage article on woes in the soviet contruction industry 
which is having to conform to the same costcutting and efficiency 
measures as the rest of the economy 
the situation here is serious in effect yeltsin said 
thus cardinal changes in our branch are especially needed 
he said gorbachevs economic and social reform program known as 
perestroika or reconstruction had reached a decisive 
phase 
its success yeltsin added depends on the support of the wide 
masses of workers who hope for changes for the better in their 
lives and link them with perestroika 
yeltsin who graduated as a construction engineer in 1955 from 
the ural polytechnical institute in sverdlovsk said the reform 
program could bring quick beneficial changes in construction 
what is reconstruction in a position to give people in the 
near future i think first of all an improvement in housing 
conditions growth in the number of uptodate medical 
installations schools and kindergartens yelstin said 
housing is an acute problem in the soviet union where one 
family in five lives in dormitories or communal dwellings a party 
program has called for the construction of enough new housing so 
each family will have its own home or apartment by the year 2000 
although the article printed in stoitelnaya gazeta made no 
reference to yeltsins stormy political career he defended the 
criticisms he had made at the october meeting of the central 
committee in an interview published abroad last month 
i spoke in a straightforward manner and said what i felt and 
thought was correct yeltsin said someone said correctly each 
must think independently so that later not all suddenly see the 
light at once 
that interview was published in the inaugural edition of a 
germanlanguage version of the staterun weekly moscow news which 
was printed and distributed in west germany 
yeltsins comments were not reproduced in moscow news russian 
editions

the pilot and copilot of a race 
balloon that floated perilously for hours above a jagged island in 
the gulf of california landed safely today and were declared the 
races winners officials said 
joe kittinger and sherry reed both of orlando fla were 
declared the unofficial winners of the annual gordon bennett 
balloon race after they touched down at 343 am on angel de la 
guarda island said race spokeswoman mildred brodbeck 
their balloon had floated about 365 miles southeast from its 
starting point in palm springs ms brodbeck said 
the pair had declared an emergency shortly after 1 am and 
called for assistance when their helium balloon began descending 
over the rough uninhabited island ms brodbeck said 
they ran out of ballast to throw overboard and began dropping 
about 100 feet a minute she said thats a lot 
ballast is made of weights used to control the altitude of such 
balloons when the helium in the craft cools it contracts and 
loses its lift said jacques soukup an official with the balloon 
federation of america 
to counteract the sinking you have to throw ballast in this 
case sand and water overboard he said 
a us coast guard jet and a us customs plane spotted the 
balloon at about 3 am and stayed nearby in case of a crash 
landing upon touchdown the jet dropped supplies including a raft 
food and water the spokeswoman said 
the couple were believed to have landed near the beach but that 
was unconfirmed ms brodbeck said 
the official winners will be announced saturday night during a 
survivors banquet and will receive a trophy designed by los 
angeles times editorial cartoonist paul conrad she said 
the other six balloons in the race which left here between 11 
pm sunday and 2 am monday all landed by monday afternoon 
the winning crew is the one whose balloon lands farthest from 
the start of the race 
restaurateur rocky aoki holds the record for the race which is 
named after new york newspaper publisher james gordon bennett who 
founded the event in paris in 1906 aoki flew 1346 miles to 
millarton sd in 1981 fickle winds held last years winner to 
just 49 miles 
of the other entrants this year distances ranged from 247 miles

a couple has won 75 million in a 
malpractice suit against a psychiatrist whose patient killed their 
23yearold daughter 
shelly rotman daughter of phyllis and alfred rotman was 
fatally stabbed july 17 1978 by dennis gould who was later found 
innocent of a murder charge by reason of insanity 
dr steven m merin had treated gould during the three years 
before the killing when he was medical director of a private 
psychiatric hospital 
merin called the verdict shocking and regrettable because he 
said he believed he had done everything i humanly could do with 
the resources available to me to make sure dennis gould did not 
kill shelly rotman 
his lawyer charles reidy said he may appeal 
merin said a number of psychiatric hospitals had treated and 
discharged gould between the time he was diagnosed as psychotic in 
1973 and the slaying 
according to testimony merin warned ms rotman in a letter in 
august 1976 that gould had talked of harming her gould had dated 
her for about one year before his breakdown 
he believed he was a messiah and that he had to kill ms rotman 
to save the jewish people according to testimony 
he continuously tried to contact her between 1973 and 1978 but 
she did not return his telephone calls and tried to avoid him said 
paul r sugarman the rotmans lawyer 
sugarman argued that merin should have hospitalized gould while 
he had psychotic delusions about ms rotman and that his letter of 
warning should have been stronger and more explicit 
ms rotman was stabbed when she arrived at a quincy nursing home 
where she worked 
the rotmans were awarded 45 million by a middlesex superior 
court jury interest payments will add 3 million to the award 
gould has been a patient at bridgewater state hospital since the 
slaying

israeli tanks pushed to within a few 
miles of syrian troops today reinforcing heavily armed israeli 
soldiers as they searched for palestinian guerrillas in the rugged 
hills of south lebanon 
syrian forces went on full alert 
helicopters flew in about 500 israeli troops to the northern 
edge of ain ata in the foothills of mount hermon before dawn 
lebanese police said 
the troops then fanned out around the area and began their 
search 
several hours later six israeli tanks and nine armored personnel 
carriers rolled into the village police said 
it seems the israelis are reinforcing their positions said 
a police spokesman who cannot be identified under standing 
regulations 
he said the syrian command ordered its estimated 16000 troops 
in the bekaa valley north of the village on maximum alert 
shortly after the israeli operation started 
in ain ata israeli troops distributed leaflets calling on 
residents not to cooperate with palestinian guerrillas the village 
of about 3500 people has been a stronghold for the guerrillas and 
their lebanese allies 
before the helicopter landing israeli artillery shelled areas 
around ain ata and several nearby villages there were no reports 
of casualties 
the operation occurred north of israels selfdesignated 
security zone in south lebanon israel created the zone in 1985 
after it withdrew most of its forces which had occupied lebanon 
since 1982 
the police spokesman said israeli troops had not clashed with 
the syrians 
but the syrians have their tanks dug in on hills overlooking 
the israeli operational zone the spokesman said 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir indicated his government 
was not seeking a confrontation with syria i dont think there 
is such a danger he told israel radio today 
he described the operation as part of israels ongoing policy of 
conducting sweeps in south lebanon and added it is a usual 
action of watching and securing the area from attacks of 
terrorists 
the operation began monday night the israeli army censor held 
up initial reports for hours 
acting lebanese prime minister salim hoss instructed its 
ambassador at the united nations rashid fakhoury to lodge a 
complaint against the israeli action 
this new aggression by the israeli occupation forces 
violates the un charter hoss said 
an israeli commander in lebanon not identified by name told 
israel radio he instructed his soldiers that the operation was a 
complicated one 
dont be speedy in pressing the trigger but if you do 
shoot you mean it seriously and shoot in order to kill 
maj gen yossi peled head of northern command told israel 
radio the operation sought to deliver a message to residents of 
the villages outside the security zone that we would not agree to 
an increase of hostile activity against the state of israel 
the operation was israels largest in lebanon since feb 17 
1986 when more than 1000 troops and dozens of tanks pushed into 
south lebanon to search for two soldiers captured by lebanese 
guerrillas 
during that operation israeli troops detained more than 100 
suspected guerrillas and questioned 3000 lebanese civilians two 
israeli soldiers and eight lebanese were killed the missing 
israelis were not found 
timur goksel spokesman for the un force in south lebanon 
said it appeared 1500 to 2000 israeli troops were involved in the 
current operation israeli sources said fewer than 1000 soldiers 
were taking part 
two guerrilla infiltrations into israel last week brought to 12 
the number that have taken place since nov 25 when a palestinian 
guerrilla landed a hang glider near an israel military base and 
killed six israeli soldiers before being shot to death 
israeli officials say the increase in crossborder raids is 
linked to the fivemonth palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
goksel said soldiers had rolled into three villages in armored 
personnel carriers and a few tanks ordered residents out of their 
homes then searched village houses the israeli newspaper maariv 
quoted an army spokesman as saying bulldozers were brought in to 
wreck houses of collaborators 
another lebanese police spokesman said reports from lebanons 
arkoub region in the foothills of mount hermon indicated israeli 
troops seized at least three suspected guerrillas 
an israeli army spokeswoman who cannot be identified according 
to israeli law said searches by the armored column were being 
concentrated in the lebanese villages of kfar chouba chebaa and 
hebbariye all within three miles of the israeli border and inside 
the 6to10mile wide security zone 
the area was once known as fatahland because fatah the 
largest palestine liberation organization faction controlled it 
before israel invaded lebanon in 1978 the israelis withdrew about 
three months later they invaded lebanon again in 1982

the chairman of the house space committee 
proposed today that congress and industry explore setting up a 
trust fund to finance future american ventures in space 
such a fund said rep robert a roe dnj chairman of the 
house science space and technology committee would work like the 
highway trust fund that financed the interstate highway system 
roe also said that the nasa budget authorization bill which a 
subcommittee will take up wednesday will for the first time 
include a multiyear authorization 
it stands to reason that any good and reasonable plan must 
have a duration of longer than a year roe told the american 
institute of aeronautics and astronautics at its annual meeting in 
nearby alexandria va we insisted on the absurdity of funding 
our plans in oneyear cycles 
he said that had worked against rational planning because you 
cannot devise a longterm research and development program hold a 
tactical team together and keep your facilities and equipment up 
to date if your primary concern is what next years budget is going 
to be 
roe said the subcommittee will authorize spending for the 
national aeronautics and space administration for fiscal 1989 
through fiscal 1991 
he said there was a great need for innovative space financing 
methods 
how about developing a national space trust fund he asked 
we have built and maintained our countrys highway system 
through the highway trust fund 
he said that nasa which will probably get 105 billion to 11 
billion for the next fiscal year needs at least 3 billion more 
he said a national space development bond program could raise the 
money 
would the people of america buy bonds for their space 
program he asked im sure they will if somebody asks them 
roe said he may hold hearings to explore public and industry 
reaction to his suggestion

reds manager pete rose called his 30day 
banishment from baseball for shoving an umpire excessive and 
says hell fight the longest suspension handed a manager in 41 
years 
national league president bart giamatti ordered the suspension 
monday two days after the incident he called one of the worst in 
baseballs recent memory 
during the ninth inning of saturday nights game rose rushed 
from the dugout to argue a delayed call by first base umpire dave 
pallone that allowed the new york mets to score the winning run in 
the 65 game 
rose said he pushed pallone twice after the umpire poked him in 
the cheek 
the game was delayed 15 minutes and pallone was forced to leave 
after fans at riverfront stadium showered the field with debris 
the game was completed with three umpires 
coach tommy helms managed the reds to a 32 victory over 
montreal on monday 
rose said he was shocked by the length of the suspension and 
would challenge it while i expected to be suspended i feel that 
this unprecedented 30 days is excessive he said 
rose will ask giamatti to reconsider and will be allowed to 
manage the team pending the outcome of the appeal giamattis 
decision would be final 
the suspension was the longest for a manager since leo durocher 
of the thenbrooklyn dodgers was suspended the entire 1947 season 
for allegedly associating with gamblers 
giamatti also said he had summoned two cincinnati broadcasters 
marty brennaman and former reds pitcher joe nuxhall to new york 
for inciting the unacceptable behavior of some of the fans by 
criticizing pallone for the call

michael dukakis steadily building his delegate lead over 
democratic presidential rival jesse jackson was heavily favored to 
score victories in ohio and indiana today while jackson urged 
ministers in the district of columbia to vote with a passion 
considered a certain victor in the nations capital but given 
little chance in ohio and indiana jackson campaigned in washington 
as the first votes were being cast and then plunged ahead on the 
campaign trail heading for appearances in atlanta and west 
virginia 
early turnout estimates varied 
in ohio there were reports of heavier than normal turnout in 
black precincts 
they are out for jesse said jim dellick director of the 
mahoning county board of elections 
in washington where jackson received twothirds of the vote in 
the 1984 presidential primary the turnout was described as 
moderate 
turnout was light in indiana where both republican and 
democratic officials said interest had been affected by the lack of 
close races it takes the excitement out of it said kurt wise 
press secretary for the indiana democratic party 
vice president george bush his claim to the gop nomination 
secure was hammering away at dukakis as inexperienced on foreign 
policy dukakis shot back with a swipe at attorney general edwin 
meese iii and criticism of the reagan administration for failing to 
provide sufficient funding for day care 
but the massachusetts governor was also being criticized by 
jackson who called dukakis a teflon candidate not being forced 
by the media to spell out the cost of his proposals 
however dukakis held to his refusal to respond directly to 
gibes from his democratic rival 
im not just a talker im a doer he said repeating a line 
he has used for months in response to jackson attacks 
dukakis was expected to capture at least 200 of the 254 
delegates at stake in indiana ohio and the district of columbia 
that harvest would place him fewer than 600 delegates shy of the 
2081 needed for the nomination and about that many ahead of 
jackson 
ohio offered the days biggest prize with 159 democratic and 88 
republican delegates at stake in indiana were 79 democratic and 30 
republican while the district of columbia offered 16 democratic 
and 14 republican 
bush surpassed the 1139 delegates needed for a gop convention 
majority last week in pennsylvania and was celebrating his victory 
at an over the top rally in a washington hotel tonight 
bush campaign manager lee atwater said president reagan would 
formally endorse the vice president in the next couple of 
weeks reagan stayed neutral while there was still a contest for 
the gop nomination 
asked if the bush attacks on dukakis represented a pattern for 
the coming months atwater said thats not the thrust of his 
campaign but hes not going to shy away from talking about that 
kind of thing either you are going to see him running an 
aggressive campaign 
campaigning in ohio on monday bush responded sharply to 
dukakis criticism of administration policies in central america 
and his charge that the us was paying panamanian strongman manuel 
noriega 200000 a year 
i cant wait for mr dukakis to discuss the noriega matter 
bush replied and id say what would you do about it its 
fine sitting out there you see you can make a lot of unfounded 
criticism but whats his suggestion whats he going to do and do 
it in a way that handles the delicate central american 
relationships that were building 
were moving towards democracy ninety percent are now living 
under democracy in this hemisphere we dont want to set that back 
by some kind of macho statement out of harvard bush said 
dukakis also was in ohio and spent part of his day visiting a 
day care center at an innercity high school as part of an attempt 
to court more black support he also told reporters he had no 
intention of criticizing jackson whose black supporters will be 
essential to any democrats chance of success in the fall 
but he had no such hesitancy toward the republicans 
we want an attorney general that you and i can be proud of 
not ashamed of he said in a reference to meese 
he also said that in his administration there wont be any 
robert borks nominated to the supreme court 
he added we cant have two and a half million people without 
a home in this country and young families who cant afford a 
home he said thats not the american dream 
jackson in a luncheon speech to the city club in cleveland 
called for a substantial increase in the minimum wage and for a 
corporate code of conduct to press companies benefiting from 
federal help to invest in america and not take jobs outside the 
country 
jackson said he would raise the minimum wage of 335 an hour to 
half the average hourly wage of production workers which is 919 
jacksons staff said he gradually would increase the wage 
standard to 550 an hour by 1993 
the democratic candidate also complained he was being held to a 
different standard by the media than was dukakis 
so far the media is allowing him to have teflon jackson 
said a reference to a situation in which opponents criticism 
slides right off 
in time that will change jackson said the media 
challenged me to show how i would pay for my dreams i have done 
just that

the third convoy of usflagged kuwaiti 
tankers in five days headed up the persian gulf today as the us 
navy tried to make up for time lost to a mine threat and fighting 
with iranian forces 
the convoy got under way as adm william h crowe jr chairman 
of the us joint chiefs of staff arrived in the gulf to inspect 
navy operations and confer with rear adm anthony a less 
commander of the joint task force middle east and other senior 
officers 
crowe was expected to meet with top officials of arab 
governments in the gulf to outline the latest change in us policy 
that will permit american warships to respond to requests for help 
from nonus flag vessels under attack by the iranians 
shipping industry and government officials in general have 
reacted favorably to the change in the us rules of engagement 
these had previously restricted commanders to protecting only 
americanflagged ships and giving only humanitarian aid to 
others if requested 
the latest convoy was confirmed by a us military spokesman 
hours after shipping executives reported it sailing through the 
strait of hormuz into the gulf for kuwait 
it included the 294739ton townsend and the 81283ton sea isle 
city both oil products tankers escorted by the destroyer uss 
merrill and the guided missile frigate uss john h sides 
the convoy was the 28th this year and the 50th since the united 
states agreed last summer to reflag and escort 11 kuwaitowned 
tankers to protect them from iranian attack 
the tankers scheduled movement had been disrupted after the 
missile frigate uss samuel b roberts was severely damaged by a 
mine in the central gulf april 14 
the united states retaliated four days later by destroying two 
iranian oil platforms and sinking or disabling six armed vessels in 
daylong fighting 
the united states accused iran of laying mines including the 
one that nearly sank the roberts and wounded 10 crewmen 
the convoys resumed after american and european minesweepers 
found and destroyed several more mines in international shipping 
lanes 
although us officials in washington denied there was any 
postponement six of the 11 tankers were backed up in the convoy 
staging area in the gulf of oman outside the gulf 
three of those the gas queen chesapeake city and surf city 
reached kuwait on friday the first convoy to make the 550mile 
trip up the gulf since the usiran clashes 
the merrill and the john h sides escorted a second convoy out 
of the gulf monday it comprised one kuwaiti tanker the 46723ton 
gas carrier gas king the us navychartered freighter rover and 
the golden monarch a privately owned us tanker 
the sea isle city was making its first return trip to the gulf 
since it was knocked out of service last oct 16 by an iranian 
missile 
the tanker was waiting to load at kuwaits main terminal when a 
chinesemade silkworm missile hit the bridge and crews quarters 
severely wounding the american captain and 17 others 
the sea isle city left the gulf march 11 after nearly five 
months in a repair yard

the federal arts agency today recommended that 
high schools require students to complete two years of arts 
instruction to help keep american children from growing up 
culturally illiterate 
a report by the national endowment for the arts on the state of 
arts education in the united states set a national goal of making 
the arts an integral part of the school curriculum from 
kindergarten through the 12th grade 
the problem is basic arts education does not exist in the 
united states today said the endowment an independent federal 
agency which underwrites a wide variety of artistic projects with a 
budget of 167 million 
the arts are in triple jeopardy the endowment said in a 
report requested by congress in 1985 they are not viewed as 
serious knowledge itself is not viewed as a prime educational 
objective and those who determine school curricula do not agree on 
what arts education is 
the endowment prescribed a series of steps including stiffer 
curriculum requirements teacher training testing and evaluation 
to provide all students not just the gifted and talented with a 
thorough education in their artistic heritage 
without knowledge and understanding of such supreme 
achievements we are culturally illiterate the report said 
endowment chairman frank hodsoll said he will lead a series of 
regional meetings with state and local arts and education officials 
around the country to make a case for the study of the arts 
the first starting next monday in st louis will include 
officials from missouri arkansas oklahoma kansas nebraska and 
texas 
hodsoll acknowledged at a news conference that his emphasis on 
arts education will be a problem in some school districts that 
favor equipping students to compete in science and technology but 
he reminded questioners that the arts are part of the basic school 
curriculum in hightech japan 
study of the arts he said helps us to be masters not 
servants of technology 
the endowment suggested doubling education secretary william j 
bennetts proposal last december for one year of art and music 
history as graduation requirements under his model high school 
curriculum 
instead the endowment proposed requiring two years of art 
courses or other approved courses that incorporate the arts to 
obtain a high school diploma and said high schools might consider 
extending the class day to seven periods to accommodate the new 
requirements 
high schools also should offer optional courses in each of the 
arts such as dance theater or films for talented students who 
wish to pursue their interests beyond the required courses the 
report said 
currently the endowment said high school graduation 
requirements in 29 states include some form of the arts but 13 of 
those states allow such courses as homemaking or industrial arts as 
substitutes and only nine require arts courses specifically 
the endowment said junior high schools grades 6 through 8 
should require all students to take arts instruction for at least 
15 percent of the school year with specific emphasis on the 
oftenneglected areas of design and media arts such as television 
and movies 
for elementary schools it recommended a fairly minimal 
guideline of 4 hours of arts instruction in a 30hour school week 
the endowment urged the states to stiffen their credentials 
requirements for arts teachers and consider using qualified 
professional artists to help fill the ranks where there are 
shortages of arts teachers 
noting that only 6 percent of school districts require 
competency tests in the arts for promoting pupils to the next 
grade the endowment said that until testing and evaluation of arts 
instruction is improved arts courses will continue to be 
considered extracurricular and unimportant 
the report concluded that the artistic heritage that is ours 
and the opportunities to contribute significantly to its evolution 
is being lost to our young people 
it cited a survey conducted three years ago which found that 61 
percent of american adults had not attended a live cultural 
performance or visited an art gallery or museum in the previous 
year 
the cultural heritage and most contemporary expression outside 
the popular culture of the moment is not part of the lives of most 
americans the endowment said but added there is evidence 
that arts education can make a difference

a guerrillaimposed road 
transport ban the third this year drastically curtailed traffic 
nationwide today 
not a single city bus was seen circulating downtown in a 
rushhour tour of the capital san salvador buses are by far the 
most important mode of public transport in el salvador 
circulation of privately owned cars was a fraction of that on a 
normal day 
thousands of workers left home early and walked often several 
miles to their jobs many owners of vans and pickups converted 
them to public transports charging 40 cents about six times the 
average bus fare 
virtually all of the pickups and vans were overcrowded during 
the previous transport ban in march the overcrowding caused 
several accidents that killed at least one person and injured 
several others 
leftist guerrillas waging an 8yearold war against the 
usbacked government called the indefinite ban in response to 
what they say is an increase in repression by police and the armed 
forces 
no time limit was put on the measure although previous bans 
have lasted two or three days the guerrillas enforce the ban by 
firing on or burning buses trucks and private cars 
on their clandestine radio venceremos they warn drivers that 
guerrillas and their supporters will be taking down license plate 
numbers and that retaliation could come at any time in the future 
dispatchers at the capitals two main intercity bus terminals 
said no buses had arrived from or left for provincial cities 
gen adolfo blandon chief of the joint chiefs of staff said 
monday night that all leaves for members of the 56000strong armed 
forces had been canceled to provide security along the nations 
roads and highways 
in previous strikes the army has put its trucks into service as 
public transport a few were seen on city streets this morning but 
not as many as in previous bans

men who answered ads in homosexual 
magazines were the primary victims of a 330000 postal money order 
scam run by seven current and former mississippi state penitentiary 
inmates officials said 
the inmates and four other people including several relatives 
of the prisoners have been charged by the federal government in 
the scam 
the april 22 indictments resulted from a probe by baltimore 
postal inspectors that began in 1986 the scheme officials said 
involved the changing of 800 us postal money orders between 
september 1986 and last month 
mississippi inmates using similar scams have cleared 5 million 
over the past six years officials estimate and the schemes have 
spread to other state prisons in los angeles indianapolis and 
michigan city ind there have been 35 convictions connected with 
the scams 
according to the recent indictments inmates wrote to those who 
had either placed or responded to personal advertisements in 
magazines inmates used fake names and claimed to be in prison on 
minor charges such as drunken driving 
two inmates would then call the individuals who responded and 
pose as the inmates case worker social worker or lawyer 
eventually victims were asked to cash money orders from the case 
worker and send the money to a third party 
the noninmates involved in the scheme would buy money orders 
for between 1 and 5 then deliver them to the inmates who would 
alter the value to amounts up to 700 
the people who received the money orders never knew they had 
been altered officials said they would cash them for the altered 
amounts and mail the money the noninmates involved would then 
forward it to the inmates 
of more than 25 victims caught in the scheme by inmates 
baltimore postal inspector jr argubright said the majority of 
victims were from homosexualoriented magazines 
for the last three years the mississippi state penitentiary at 
parchman has stamped all prisoners letters with the warning that 
recipients should not cash any money orders enclosed state 
corrections department ken jones said 
however prisoners circumvent this precaution by sending letters 
to coconspirators outside prison who mail them in other envelopes

a man convicted for a second time in the 
1973 murders of six members of a family faced a possible death 
sentence as the sentencing phase of his trial began today 
a dekalb county superior court jury on monday found wayne carl 
coleman guilty in the slayings of ned alday his brother aubrey 
neds sons jimmy jerry and chester and jerrys wife mary 
the sentencing phase of colemans trial opened today with 
testimony by police officials who investigated a maryland slaying 
allegedly committed by coleman and his codefendants 
defense attorneys said they plan to call colemans mother and 
sister to testify about mitigating circumstances in his early life 
the slayings took place may 14 1973 colemans original conviction 
was overturned on appeal 
when the verdict was announced coleman standing with his hands 
in his pockets shifted his weight from one leg to another but 
otherwise showed no reaction 
prosecuting attorney charles ferguson has said he will seek the 
death penalty 
west expressed disappointment at the verdict but said there was 
a good chance coleman 41 could receive a life sentence because 
the jury took about 3 hours to reach a verdict 
theyre taking this very carefully one of the jurors was 
crying the jury seems to be sympathetic to wayne west said 
coleman his halfbrother carl isaacs and a third man george 
dungee were convicted and sentenced to death in 1974 for the 
slayings 
the victims had interrupted a burglary at jerry aldays trailer 
in the southwest georgia town of donalsonville the five alday men 
were shot to death one by one at the trailer and mary alday was 
killed in a nearby field after being raped repeatedly according to 
testimony 
a federal appeals court ordered new trials in 1985 ruling that 
excessive publicity made it impossible for the three to get fair 
trials in seminole county site of the murders and first trial 
isaacs was convicted of murder and again sentenced to death at 
his retrial in perry in january dungee is to be tried later this 
year in columbus 
coleman did not testify at his trial psychologist howard 
albrecht said coleman was a depressed passive individual with 
few leadership capabilities and would suffer a severe anxiety 
attack if called to testify 
in closing arguments west portrayed coleman as a passive 
dimwitted accomplice of clever murderers 
he also attacked the testimony of billy isaacs carl isaacs 
brother who turned states evidence in the original trial and 
testified against coleman last week 
billy isaacs was 15 at the time of the killings and received a 
40year sentence 
defense attorneys called carl isaacs to the stand monday but he 
refused to testify

mayor eugene sawyer has accepted an apology from 
an aide accused of making slurs against jews and christians but 
the mayor later said the apology might not be sufficient 
in this administration with this mayor we will not tolerate 
any individual who has views of this type sawyer said monday 
night at a reception given by a jewish group 
we are reviewing the situation and we will have something to 
say about it in the near future sawyer added 
his remarks came at the end of a day of demands that he fire the 
aide steve cokely for remarks in four lectures before the 
chicagobased nation of islam between august 1985 and november 1987 
in the lectures taped and later sold at the nations bookstore 
cokely who is black variously contended that jews are conspiring 
to gain world control and that the crucifix is a symbol of white 
supremacy 
i humbly apologize to chicago residents of all races and 
religious groups who were offended by remarks made prior to my 
ascension to the mayors office cokely 35 said monday in a 
signed apology 
at the time of the lectures cokely was an aide to thenalderman 
sawyer who became mayor after the nov 25 death of mayor harold 
washington 
i have since working in the mayors office respected all 
those i have had the privilege to serve said cokely who makes 
35000 a year 
sawyer said monday night that cokelys apology might not be 
sufficient he made that comment at a downtown reception for 300 
people celebrating the 40th anniversary of the state of israel 
sawyer had answered questions about cokely earlier in the day by 
saying i dont think its necessary to fire him hes got a wife 
and family he needs the income so ive asked him to tone down his 
rhetoric 
a telephone call to cokely at his city hall office monday was 
not returned 
a guest at monday nights reception state sen howard carroll 
of chicago said an apology is not enough 
it wasnt an accidental speech made in the heat of the 
moment carroll said of cokelys remarks 
alderman bernard l stone called for cokelys ouster and 
alderman edwin eisendrath said the city council would take up the 
matter next week if the mayor fails to act 
eisendrath said he had drafted a resolution asking that cokely 
be fired if sawyer has not already done so by the next regularly 
scheduled city council meeting on may 11 
im shocked that he hasnt already been told to pack his 
bags eisendrath said 
groups denouncing cokelys remarks and demanding that he be 
removed included the antidefamation league of bnai brith the 
american jewish committee the community renewal society an urban 
mission agency and the illinois ethnic consultation which

today surgically separated 17monthold twin girls joined at the 
head since birth

mphonyana mathibela early today and completed the surgery 7 hours 
later 
baragwanath hospital reported late this afternoon that both 
girls survived the operation and described it as successful no 
other details were available immediately 
about four hours into the surgery hospital officials described 
the black girls as stable and said doctors were very happy with 
progress so far 
last september doctors at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore 
separated west german twins joined at the head the boys benjamin 
and patrick binder survived and were released in march but they 
reportedly are suffering physical and mental problems 
the baragwanath medical team headed by dr robert lipschitz 
performed two operations on the black girls last october to prepare 
for todays surgery 
the girls share a major blood vessel in their heads which 
doctors partially clamped in the earlier operations in hopes lesser 
blood vessels would take over the functions of the shared vein 
this is going to be a long lengthy intricate operation which 
carries many dangers with it lipschitz said last week of todays 
surgery the prognosis is still very grave 
sophie mathibela the girls mother attended a prayer service 
at the hospital chapel this morning about 100 people mostly 
nurses and patients said prayers and sang hymns for the girls

a computer expert who worked for a 
company that helps operate the pennsylvania state lottery printed a 
fake ticket so that he and a friend could share a 152 million 
jackpot state officials said today 
henry rich used a computer at his firm control data corp to 
print a copy of the winning ticket then gave it to mark s herbst 
state attorney general leroy s zimmerman said at a news conference 
today 
the ticket listed the winning numbers for the super 7 lottery 
drawing last july 15 one winning ticket to that jackpot was sold 
statewide but the winner had never claimed the prize 
when he came forward last week herbst claimed he had kept the 
ticket in a cigar box then used it as a bookmark until recent 
stories about the unclaimed prize led him to doublecheck the 
numbers 
herbst cashed the ticket last thursday and received a 469989 
check for the first installment state officials quickly detected 
the attempted fraud however and the money was never paid 
zimmerman said 
rich a computer expert at control data which works with the 
state lottery has been charged with theft by unlawful taking 
theft by deception conspiracy forgery tampering with public 
information and unlawful use of a computer zimmerman said rich is 
being held in dauphin county prison 
zimmerman said herbst was in custody this morning and would be 
charged later in the day 
james scroggins executive director of the lottery said the 
forgery was traced because herbsts ticket was printed on paper 
that was returned to the state by a lotteryticket agent in 
scranton while computer records showed the unclaimed winning 
ticket was actually sold in bucks county 
scroggins admitted that some lottery officials had doubts about 
the validity of the ticket but he said he decided to award the 
prize anyway because the computer validation code on the bogus 
ticket was accurate 
by 430 pm thursday zimmerman said lottery officials knew the 
ticket was fake and stopped payment on the check which herbst had 
deposited in several accounts at a local bank 
agents from zimmermans office confronted herbst on sunday 
zimmerman said herbst told the agents rich was expecting 5000 
from him monday 
on monday night zimmerman said herbst gave rich 5000 
provided by the state rich who was armed tried to flee when 
agents moved in but he was captured without incident the 
prosecutor said 
this is the second fixing case to plague the pennsylvania 
lottery the april 24 1980 drawing of the daily number was fixed 
by altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits 
the socalled 666 case named after the winning numbers also 
resulted in tighter security procedures for the televised drawings 
scroggins said new procedures would also be implemented because of 
the new case

a french mathematics professor has 
turned down a 136000 prize for theoretical research because he 
earns enough as a teacher an award spokesman said tuesday 
alexander grothendieck wrote to the committee for the 
prestigious swedish craaford prize to reject the prize 
we were aware he had opinions but the letter did come as a 
bit of a surprise said tord ganelius of the royal swedish 
academy of sciences which awards the prize 
it was a very polite letter with beautiful french ways of 
expression he said he did well on his professors salary and that 
others get less if one single person gets more said ganelius 
this kind of beautiful idealism is rare 
the committee announced april 13 that the germanborn 
grothendieck of the southern university of science and technology 
in montpellier would share the prize with pierre deligne of the 
institute for advanced study at princeton nj they were cited for 
fundamental research in algebraic geometry which has practical 
applications in satellite communications and other fields 
ganelius said deligne was expected to attend the prize ceremony 
in stockholm sept 21 to collect his half of the prize the other 
half will be returned to the prize fund

the united states and laos began a 
search tuesday for remains of two us soldiers shot down 22 years 
ago on a reconnaissance mission in a remote area of laos a us 
military spokesman said 
a 14member us military team flew from bangkok on two c130 
transport planes to meet a group of laotian officials at the crash 
site in savannakhet province of southern laos said maj tim 
pfister a spokesman for the us pacific command 
the two aircraft carried electric generators metal detectors 
and tools to excavate the site where the mohawk ov1a airplane 
crashed 
the joint search is the third in a us effort to account for 
about 2400 americans who did not return from the indochina war 
the wars in laos vietnam and cambodia ended in 1975 with victories 
of communist forces but some americans lost in the early 1960s 
were listed as missing in action 
a preliminary ground search involving us military experts last 
week failed to locate any human remains at the site in southern 
laos 
the american team which includes an expert in identifying human 
remains and two explosive disposal specialists will live in tents 
during the weeklong search pfister said 
the team is from the us joint casualty resolution center and 
the army central identification laboratory the honolulubased 
agencies are working to resolve the fates of amerians missing in 
action in vietnam cambodia and laos 
the us defense department lists 555 mias in laos mostly 
pilots who went down on missions over the ho chi minh trail the 
vital communist supply line which funneled men and material from 
north vietnam to south vietnam 
pfister said the laotian and us teams hope to discover the 
fates of two soldiers reported missing after heavy ground fire 
struck their airplane on march 15 1966 
another us aircraft on the same mission reported that one 
crewman parachuted out but landed near where the plane crashed 95 
miles east of savannakhet city and 25 miles west of the main 
section of the ho chi minh trail 
serial numbers found on wreckage last week were confirmed by the 
aircraft manufacturer the grumman corp as belonging to an ov1a 
mohawk a us embassy spokesman said famlies of the two crewmen 
have been notified but the names of the mias have not been 
publicly released 
the remains of 11 americans were recovered in the first joint 
excavation in laos in 1985 and eight other sets of remains were 
found in 1986 
on previous excavations the workers went down on hands and 
knees using small shovels and other hand tools to dig out plane 
wreckage and fine metal screens to sift for bone fragments a 
number of unexploded shells were found prompting the addition of 
explosives experts to the new team 
us experts say chances of uncovering remains grow smaller with 
the passage of time in the harsh tropical climate they say looting 
by local people also takes a toll

a skeptical eighthgrader analyzed her 
school lunches for nutritional value and says the meals did not 
make the grade 
thirteenyearold lauren pratt has been carrying her own lunch 
to school for some time taking salads fruits vegetables an 
occasional sandwich and is big on raisins her mother megan 
pratt said today 
i was always skeptical of school lunches said lauren pratt 
a shawnee junior high student who won state recognition for her 
experiments 
they tell you they are nutritional and i suppose they are 
from the standpoint of the basic food groups but it seemed to me 
that there was an awful lot of fried food and salt if everything 
is fried then the food group balance doesnt matter that much 
miss pratt said 
miss pratt recently froze five school lunches and extracted or 
calculated their fats proteins sodium cholesterol and 
carbohydrates using equipment at the oklahoma food laboratory in 
oklahoma city 30 miles west of here 
she did the analysis as a project for the oklahoma science and 
engineering fair her effort was recognized by the oklahoma section 
of the american chemical society as a firstplace project in the 
junior high division 
the meals were high in sodium calories and cholesterol 
miss pratt said they do have a high level of protein as well 
but its unhealthy to go through school eating that kind of diet 
eating habits that are formed in early childhood have been 
found to be extremely resistant to change and seem to affect 
individuals the rest of their lives the teenager said 
state officials said students wouldnt eat more nutritious fare 
when it was offered and often threw the food in the trash 
if the schools are to change well have also have to change 
the likes and dislikes coming into the cafeteria said tom 
freeman assistant superintendant and director of child nutrition 
programs for the state department of education 
the days of liver and spinach are past freeman said

punishment appropriate 
the agreement came three weeks after the commission found 
officer james horka the senior officer outside the apartment 
guilty of five misconduct charges and voted 21 to fire him 
rather than kick down the doors of the apartment horka waited 
for the landlord to arrive with a key he testified at his hearing

an unlocked back door however and rescued the girl as she was

a woman who says she had an affair with cook 
county board president george dunne has denied that she got her 
county job because of the relationship 
the better government association a private watchdog group has 
demanded that dunne board president for 19 years and cook county 
democratic party chairman resign for giving county government jobs 
or preferential job treatment to women who agreed to sexual trysts 
but marie perkins 35 said monday she apologized to dunne for 
bringing the affair to the associations attention 
if anyone should resign from a job it is me said perkins 
a police officer with the forest preserve district she said she 
got her job not through sex but through proper channels 
the bga contends that dunne a 75yearold widower engaged in 
sex with four women between 1980 the year his wife died and 
1986 
dunne has said he is guilty of nothing more than extremely 
poor judgment and having relationships with the opposite sex 
which hurt no one 
leading democrats have rallied behind the veteran politician and 
members of the cook county board gave him a heros welcome monday 
illinois house speaker michael j madigan and senate president 
philip j rock were among officeholders saying dunne should remain 
at the helm of the countys democratic party organization 
but not all of his colleagues agreed the matter should be 
dropped 
when you have such allegations i think its the duty of the 
states attorney and the us attorney to investigate said

the boeing 747 that landed outside tokyo with 
only one engine operating had run out of fuel for the other three 
aviation sources in and out of the us government said today 
the sources who asked not to be identified said that the tanks 
supplying fuel to the three dead engines were found to be dry when 
the plane landed 
the fourth tank had about 20000 pounds of fuel remaining and 
was in no imminent danger of also going day 
it was not known whether the fuel problem had been caused by a 
pilot error or by a mechanical problem with the planes 
fuelswitching equipment on a boeing 747 fuel is routinely 
transferred from tank to tank during a long flight to balance the 
aircraft 
one source said it is possible that a fuel line or filter could 
have kept the fuel from being shifted properly or the flight crew 
by mistake might have shifted too much fuel into the fourth tank 
and not been able to shift it back in time 
the boeing jumbo jet has a variety of gauges to tell the flight 
crew how much fuel has been burned and how much is left the flight 
engineer in the threeperson cockpit normally performs his own 
calculations as to fuel burn and availability as well 
either one of two things happened either the crew messed up 
or the transfer pumps or valves or lines were not working 
properly said the source 
a boeing 747 has a maximum fuel capacity of 320000 pounds and 
burns about 23500 pounds of fuel per hour while cruising with all 
four engines operating according to the manufacturer 
the plane united airlines flight 97 from los angeles to tokyo 
with 239 passengers and 19 crew members aboard first lost the use 
of one engine at 39000 feet over the pacific ocean about 75 
minutes from the airport a second engine failed about 30 minutes 
later 
pilot jack harper radioed the control tower at 249 pm that he 
had shut down two of the four engines due to malfunctions and asked 
permission to land a third engine failed shortly before landing 
the plane touched down safely at the airport in narita 40 miles 
northeast of tokyo 
the washington post reported the fuel starvation problem in 
todays editions 
a tokyo newspaper yomiuri shimbun said that during the flight 
the gauge that indicates how much fuel is feeding into the engines 
showed there was almost no fuel going into engines one and four and 
that the no 3 engine was malfunctioning

the reagan administrations new policy of 
extending naval protection to neutral ships in the persian gulf has 
been formally implemented the pentagon said today 
under the new policy announced last friday us warships in the 
gulf may come to the aid of any neutral friendly commercial ship 
not serving ports in iran or iraq if the ship comes under attack in 
international waters 
defense secretary frank c carlucci said last friday the new 
policy would be implemented once we have informed those free 
world nonbelligerent countries that maintain shipping interests 
in the gulf 
dan howard the pentagons chief spokesman said the 
appropriate people have been notified and the new policy was now 
in effect 
howard said the policy applied equally to both iran and iraq 
when it came to breaking up attacks on merchant ships 
if it meets the criteria then the rules are the same for 
whoever the attacker might be howard said 
the spokesman noted however the united states did not expect 
any confrontations with iraqi forces because that country has 
limited its attacks to ships steaming inside certain declared 
exclusion or war zones 
the pattern is pretty clear said howard the exceptions 
the attacks have been for the most part by iran outside the 
exclusion zone 
we are prepared under certain circumstances to offer 
assistance to nonbelligerent vessels serving neutral ports 
that are attacked by anyone outside the exclusion zones

east berlin jews said today a chicago rabbi had 
been chosen to head their community on an interim basis but the 
rabbi said he had yet to receive an invitation and didnt know 
whether he would go to east germany 
american jewish committee also denied that such an arrangement 
had been made 
however rabbi ernst m lorge contacted in chicago said he 
would be willing to consider a shortterm arrangement 
i have not yet received an official invitation to come to east 
germany and if i do i would have to think about it said lorge 
71 i might accept something shorter in term my life is here 
in chicago i imagine with some understanding we could come to some 
kind of agreement 
at issue is a successor for rabbi isaac neuman who is leaving 
east berlin after an eightmonth tenure marked by several disputes 
with the citys jewish community president 
sources within the east berlin jewish community told the 
associated press that president peter kirchner had received a 
letter from the american jewish committee naming lorge as interim 
successor for neuman 
kirchner has confirmed that lorge is going to be the new 
rabbi but he will be a rabbi on an interim basis until a 
permanent rabbi can be found sources close to the jewish 
community president said 
they said jewish leaders have in mind a rabbi in his 30s as a 
permanent successor but declined to elaborate the sources spoke 
on condition of anonymity 
eugene dubow director of community services for the american 
jewish community denied that such an arrangement had been made 
with lorge 
there is no truth to the report that he is coming dubow 
said in a telephone interview from new york 
he said lorge had been a guest rabbi in east berlin during the 
high holidays in the past 
lorge who was born in mainz germany and emigrated to the 
united states to flee nazi persecution in 1936 said he wanted to 
help east germanys jewish community 
i have a philosophy that hitler should not get a posthumous 
victory that there should not be any country where jews are not 
able to have any kind of community he said 
neuman complained last weekend of interference from leadership 
of the local jewish community and outlined differences with the 
communist government over funding he said he would leave east 
berlin on may 16 and might return in september but not to work 
jewish leaders in a statement to the official east german news 
agency adn denied they meddled in neumans activities 
the assertion that rabbi neuman was hindered in carrying out 
his functions by members or the community representatives or 
other people must be rejected with emphasis the statement said 
it said neuman told community members last month that he was 
returning to his champaign ill home for medical reasons 
his current assertion that antisemitic tendencies in the 
press of the german democratic republic east germany have caused 
his return were never raised in his discussions with the 
community the statement added 
in explaining why he was leaving in an interview at his east 
berlin home last weekend neuman 65 talked of differences with 
the east german press over coverage of israel and attitudes toward 
jewish issues 
the east german jewish community has fewer than 350 officially 
registered members and about 100 others last september neuman 
became the first rabbi assigned to east germany in 21 years

the united methodist church upheld bans on 
homosexual activity by clergy and others but left the way open for 
americas secondlargest protestant denomination to gain more 
knowledge on the subject 
some leaders said the approval monday at the denominations 
governing convention of a fouryear study on homosexuality had left 
the reaffirmed bans in question 
its a tacit recognition that there is some legitimacy to 
various points of view said the rev george mcclain of new york 
city executive of the methodist federation for social action 
the churchs ninemember judicial conference a church court 
must rule by wednesday whether the study can be funded under a rule 
that bars funding of any homosexual group or promoting acceptance 
of homosexuality 
delegates overwhelmingly approved that action along with 
continuation of the bans on active homosexuals in the clergy and 
condemnations of such activity generally then authorized the study 
united methodists often called those singing methodists 
today began consideration of a new 625song hymn book that 
contains 330 new numbers including spirituals and gospel songs 
the hymnal however also retains a heavy sprinkling of numbers 
by the methodists hymnwriting founder john wesley 
friction over homosexuality has continued for two decades in the 
96 millionmember united methodist church largest in us 
protestantism after southern baptists and has troubled other 
denominations 
homosexuality has proved to be particularly troubling to 
conscientious christians of differing opinion the methodists 
declared in authorizing the study of the origins and nature of the 
practice biologically psychologically and sociologically 
delegates voted 676 to 293 to maintain the restriction on 
ordained clergy and even more strongly 765 to 181 for the 
expanded blanket rejection of homosexual practice 
the restrictions expressed uncertainty about homosexuality and 
during a nearly fourhour debate some delegates charged they were 
based on shaky ground 
we admit we lack understanding of homosexuality and yet we 
are willing to condemn those who some say by gods choice are 
homosexual and who are living a homosexual lifestyle said the 
rev betty jane young of maplewood nj 
the rev richard timberlake of knoxville tenn said there were 
hundreds of petitions urging the restrictions and that not 
upholding the bans would break faith with our constituency 
others said not keeping the bans would drive thousands out of 
the church 
during a break in the debate about 150 members of a homosexual 
caucus called affirmation gathered around the podium we are a 
gentle angry people and we are singing singing for our lives 
they sang 
although the reaffirmed restrictions were tempered to some 
extent affirmation leaders denounced them 
its a terrible thing that the church wants to cut itself off 
from a whole class of people by calling them secondclass 
citizens said the rev morris floyd of minneapolis 
the rev julian rush an avowed homosexual minister from denver 
called the votes distressing 
i remain convinced that the longer we put off really facing up 
to this issue the deeper and deeper the polarization in our church 
will become rush said 
while it is widely recognized that countless clergy and others 
during christian history have been homosexuals most churches 
reject homosexual activity particularly among the clergy 
however in many cases dealing with the matter is left to 
regional units or dioceses 
in issuing its marginally modified blanket position in the book 
of discipline on monday the denomination declared 
although we do not condone the practice of homosexuality and 
consider this practice incompatible with christian teaching we 
affirm that gods grace is available to all 
the latter phrase was added to previous phraseology along with 
other appended portions emphasizing the churchs care and ministry 
to all persons 
new material also acknowledged our limited understanding of 
the complexities of sex and said the church should take the lead in 
exploring this most complex issue 
delegates also set a theme for the churchs next four years of 
celebrate and witness to christ in connection with a stress on 
evangelism to stem a gradual shrinkage in membership 
the conference also authorized the board of higher education to 
seek to raise a 100 million fund for scholarships for needy 
students

i could feel the plane lose the power and start floating in 
the air like a hang glider i thought we are going to crash she 
said 
united airline spokesman robert leu said ua flight 97 from los 
angeles to tokyo with 239 passengers and 19 crew members aboard

preparation for an emergeny landing

a mass recall of pet missouri bullfrogs is under 
way prompted by fears that when they mature they may gobble up the 
gentler denizens of british garden ponds 
in washington a missouri congressman says he can already 
imagine the movie version the bullfrogs that ate britain 
peter barratt who owns a garden supply center in newcastle 
northern england says about 200 of the 400 tadpoles he sold have 
been returned since he put out the recall notice 
theyre still coming in as we speak he said in a telephone 
interview 
but is it too late 
missouri bullfrogs can grow to a foot long raising mayhem in 
garden ponds four to six years from now when they reach maturity 
if you put an american bullfrog on one side of the ecological 
scales everything is going to fall off the other side because it 
will gobble it all up tony tynan the naturalist who alerted the 
garden center was quoted as telling the daily telegraph 
at the time they went on the market the bullfrogs seemed like 
no more than a novelty item something to scare off cats or herons 
on the prowl for goldfish 
barratt said an outbreak of marauding missouri bullfrogs in 
italy several years ago set off the fears 
we were fairly ignorant on this subject he said 
hindsight is a wonderful thing 
once we heard the full facts and were aware of what could 
happen we took a decision straight away to recall them he said 
barratt thinks people may be leaping to conclusions about the 
threat so long as the bullfrogs arent released into the wild he 
doesnt see them going on the rampage 
nonetheless he has put up signs in his store apologizing to 
froglovers for the inconvenience and offering to refund them the 
185 price of each tadpole 
us rep jack buechner rmo says the news made him jump 
after hearing this i hopped over to the house floor to 
deliver this sad news to my colleagues he said recently in 
washington 
lest the tiny creatures of britain croak it is far better 
that our missouri bullfrogs be recalled sounds like a horror film 
the bullfrogs that ate britain 
and so my colleagues i stand before you warts and all 
as a responsible missourian i believe that although we should 
not leap to conclusions we must ensure our frogs do not cause any 
undue harm in the land of thatcher 
so we welcome our british brethren to send back both our 
tadpoles and footlong bullfrogs back home 
imagine a footlong frog 
who would believe it 
its no wonder they call missouri the show me state 
barratt said the recalled tadpoles are being returned to the 
supplier who imported them from st louis but he did not know 
whether they were being shipped back to missouri

michael dukakis looked to lengthen his delegate lead over a 
contentious jesse jackson in indiana and ohio primaries on tuesday 
as the democratic presidential campaign turned predictable jackson 
sought a consolation prize in the district of columbia primary 
dukakis held a large lead in preelection polls in the two 
midwestern states jackson was favored even more strongly in the 
heavily black nations capital 
but the days delegate arithmetic clearly favored dukakis now 
seemingly the prohibitive favorite to lock up the nomination weeks 
before the democratic national convention convenes in july in 
atlanta ohio picked 159 delegates to the democratic national 
convention indiana 79 and the district of columbia 16 
the massachusetts governor whose candidacy has been embraced in 
recent days by a slow but steady trickle of democratic party 
leaders began the day with nearly 1300 of the 2081 delegates 
needed to clinch the nomination a lead of nearly 450 in the 
associated press count over his sole remaining rival 
dukakis aides conceded jacksons victory in the district of 
columbia in advance but said they hoped it would be his last of 
the primary season 
if the democratic primaries seemed to hold little suspense 
there was absolutely no mystery at all on the republican side 
vice president george bush faced no active ballot opposition in 
ohio indiana the district of columbia or elsewhere he arranged 
an over the top victory celebration at a washington hotel to 
celebrate the mathematical lock he gained on the gop nomination 
last week 
despite his certain nomination bush campaigned energetically in 
ohio and indiana previewing campaign themes for use in the fall 
against the democrats 
he accused dukakis of foreign policy inexperience and sought to 
depict him and jackson as advocates of policies that hearken back 
to the jimmy carter era 
on the left dukakis was being squeezed by jackson who turned 
up the heat on his democratic rival after last weeks landslide 
loss in pennsylvania 
he outspent dukakis in ohio television campaigning by a margin 
of 4to1 and roughed up the massachusetts governor for the first 
time in a broadcast commercial 
bush wants to stay the course michael dukakis wants to manage 
the damage said the commercial jesse jackson wants to change 
the course of america 
dukakis declined to be drawn into a battle with jackson as he 
campaigned with his attention divided between the primary calendar 
and the general election campaign in blue collar precincts he 
sharply criticized president reagans decision to veto trade 
legislation over a provision requiring notification to workers 
before a plant can be closed

the massachusetts governor spent four days campaigning in ohio 
and indiana but figured only a twoday swing through next weeks 
primary states in west virginia and nebraska would be sufficient to 
move them into his column 
a new poll in california showed dukakis with a handsome lead in 
the state which selects 314 delegates the largest single prize in 
the nation in a june 7 primary 
rep richard gephardt one of several campaign dropouts was 
quoted by one of his own supporters as saying the time had come to 
rally around the massachusetts governor 
a few delegates backing sens paul simon and albert gore both 
of whom have suspended their campaigns converted to the dukakis 
side as well 
as dukakis nomination moved toward the inevitable jackson for 
the first time lashed out at his opponent 
the massachusetts governor turned aside jacksons criticism by 
saying im not just a talker im a doer and criticized the 
reagan administration and bush instead 
he frequently mentioned the plant closing legislation and bushs 
support of reagans intended veto 
he said secretary of state george shultz a labor economist by 
training had once suggested in a book that displaced workers need 
up to a year to adjust maybe the secretary can help the white 
house understand the trauma and agony and pain of being laid off 
he said 
he criticized the administration on foreign policy as well 
i want to know why we were doing business with manuel 
noriega why they were paying off noriega why they were doing 
business with a drugrunning panamanian dictator he said 
thats the first thing we need a full explanation and i think 
the people of america are entitled to it 
while dukakis turned his attention increasingly to the fall 
campaign jackson decided to step up his challenge for the 
nomination 
he squelched campaign aides who were uttering semiconcessions 
of defeat in the nominating race and began demanding that dukakis 
be bolder and more specific in his campaign 
so far dukakis has operated with caution when we must operate 
with courage clarity and candor he said at one point pressing 
his rival to speak out on southern africa and economic issues 
bush devoted more time than dukakis did to campaigning in ohio 
and indiana saying he didnt intend to project overconfidence 
he criticized the democrats wherever he went scorning dukakis 
at one point for heeding macho advice from harvard university 
on foreign policy 
i cant wait for mr dukakis to discuss the noriega matter 
and id say what would you do about it 
he sought to link dukakis and jacksons views to the tough 
economic times found by the reagan administration in 1981 the 
country wants to move ahead not go back to the misery we 
inherited he said 
bush also said he was prepared to fire back if dukakis sought to 
make an issue of meese and his legal difficulties 
there is plenty of evidence to kind of go into a 
guiltbyassociation mode where we can find in massachusetts 
politics or campaign stuff or things of that nature he said i 
hope we dont have to do it

deter her by blocking access mrs page said 
karen rood a member of the new york chapter of the national 
organization for women said they had about 50 people outside the 
doctors office to help people get access to the clinic and 
escort women inside

across the street from the antiabortion demonstrators but no 
patients tried to enter the small residential building housing the 
doctors office before the demonstration ended early in the 
afternoon

counseling was unable to open his office because of the

united states said the worst scenario would be a trade war 
between the major trading powers avoiding trade confrontation 
is now a high priority for all governments 
in remarks that could be interpreted as criticism of some 
provisions of the trade bill reagan plans to veto holkeri urged

a special grand jury today called city 
officials conduct in the 1985 move siege that led to 11 deaths 
totally unacceptable but returned no criminal indictments in 
what it called the citys greatest tragedy 
eleven people died and 61 homes were destroyed on may 13 1985 
when police dropped a bomb on a barricaded west philadelphia row 
house occupied by the radical group move 
applying the law to the facts as we find them no charges are 
warranted yet we do not exonerate the men responsible for this 
disaster the grand jury said in its 279page report rather 
than a vindication of those officials this report should stand as 
a permanent record of their morally reprehensible behavior 
this city its leaders and citizens must never forget the 
terrible cost of their misjudgments 
the confrontation started after neighbors who had been targets 
of threats and harassment for several years told authorities they 
would try to evict move themselves unless the city acted 
the grand jury report released this afternoon denounced the 
citys planning for and actions in the siege as incompetent and 
inept it especially castigated mayor w wilson goode 
as the citys chief executive officer and the man legally 
responsible for law enforcement in the city goode delegated too 
much deferred too often and asked too few questions the report 
said 
the move group championed backtonature rituals lived in filth 
with rats and other animals refused to send their children to 
school and disobeyed health and safety laws it was decimated by 
the disaster and most of its living members are now in jail 
the report said other top officials also were uninformed 
including the citys no 2 executive at the time former managing 
director leo brooks 
during the confrontation when police gunfire failed to drive 
out the move members goode approved a plan to drop an explosive 
device on the row house from a helicopter 
the bomb started a fire not immediately fought that eventually 
destroyed 1 city blocks and killed 11 people five of them 
children in the fortified move compound damage caused by the 
police action already has exceeded 20 million including 
rebuilding the burneddown neighborhood 
the grand jury said it considered criminal charges involving 
conspiracy murder involuntary manslaughter aggravated assault 
and other charges it determined in not bringing charges that 
goodes conduct was not reckless under the law that is that he 
did not consciously disregard a substantial and unjustifiable risk 
that people would be placed in danger of death or serious bodily 
injury by the dropping of the bomb 
a federal grand jury which has been probing for more than a 
year whether the civil rights of the 11 victims were 
unconstitutionally violated is nearing the end of its work 
a report from the federal panel with a possibility of 
indictments is expected in a few months possibly by the start of 
summer 
beside police participants others criticized by the mayors 
investigating commission were brooks who ran operations at the 
move scene former police commissioner gregore samborwho planned 
the bombing and fire commissioner william richmond accused of 
delaying fighting the blaze because officials allegedly hoped the 
flames would drive out the occupants

congress should pass a universal health 
insurance plan similar to the one signed into law last month by 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis former cabinet member joseph 
califano said tuesday 
califano who was secretary of health education and welfare 
during the carter administration said all other industrialized 
nations make health care or insurance available to their citizens 
he said his son is working and studying at a west german 
hospital and receives full health coverage for 45 a month 
we can do it in this country the dukakis plan provides a 
model califano told the joint economic committees subcommittee 
on education and health at a hearing on the future of health care 
in america 
the plan advanced by dukakis the likely democratic presidential 
nominee gives tax incentives to employers who offer health 
insurance to their employees and sets up a state fund to help the 
unemployed the selfemployed and others buy insurance for 
themselves at subsidized rates the cost is estimated at 645 
million over the next five years 
universal health insurance was one of three changes which 
califano said he would make if he were trying to improve us 
health care and had no limits on what he could spend 
he said he would also mount a huge health education and disease 
prevention campaign and spend an enormous amount of money on 
research into addiction and the afflictions of the aged 
particularly incontinence immobility and memory loss 
califano said at least 1 billion a year should be spent on 
aging research and a new institute on addiction should be created 
at the national institutes of health to study all forms of 
substance abuse including smoking 
the cost of addiction in health care alone easily exceeds 50 
billion yet out of a total health research budget of 6 billion 
the government spends less than 200 million to learn about 
addiction said califano 
califano also offered ways to hold down health care costs among 
them capping malpractice awards and setting treatment standards 
based on what is proven to work the latter would help reduce 
unnecessary procedures and hospital admissions he said 
authorities also need a sea change in community attitudes to 
help them start eliminating 400000 excess hospital beds that are 
costing 12 billion a year to maintain califano said 
closing hospitals is hard labor califano acknowledged 
everyone admits we have too many hospital beds in america 
theyre just all in someone elses town city or neighborhood 
califano author of a 1986 book called americas health care 
revolution said the major stumbling block to his recommendations 
is the health care industry 
for these efforts to succeed to have any hope of restraining 
costs the political system has to free itself from domination by 
health care providers califano said he said their political 
action committees spent more on congressional races in the last 
election cycle than any other industry except financial services 
daniel waldo of the governments health care financing 
administration said the trend toward higher spending on health 
care is inevitable and desirable he said more and more money is 
becoming available for health care as national income increases 
the aging of the population also contributes to higher 
expenditures he said as does the willingness of people to pay for 
more care demonstrated by the rise in adult orthodontia

the state may not tax the potawatomi 
indians for cigarette sales to tribal members at the tribes store 
near shawnee a judge has ruled 
us district judge lee west ruled recently that the tribe must 
work with state officials to set up a system for charging taxes on 
purchases made by people who do not belong to the tribe 
i think this will apply to any sales made at their store 
david miley state tax commission general counsel said tuesday 
we will have to see the wording in the final judgment but from 
reading the order i think it would apply to all their sales 
the tax commission billed the citizen band potawatomi indian 
tribe in march 1987 for 2691470 in taxes it said were owed on 
cigarettes sold since 1982 at the gallery trading post 
the tribe sued contending such taxes violated tribal 
sovereignty 
miley said the commission would decide whether to appeal after a 
final judgment is issued

the army wants to go ahead and build a new 
biological warfare test laboratory in utah despite strong public 
opposition administration officials said tuesday 
the army has temporarily shelved its proposal to construct the 
facility at dugway proving grounds but plans to seek the money 
again next year the officials testified to a trio of house 
subcommittees 
they said the united states has unilaterally renounced any use 
of biological weapons but still needs to conduct research in the 
field because of germ weapons that might be developed by nations 
like the soviet union 
we certainly have the responsibility to the soldier to protect 
him and her against those who would use biological weapons said 
thomas welch deputy assistant secretary of defense we must 
provide the masks detectors vaccines and so on 
the controversy involves army plans to build a 54 million lab 
which would have a biosafety level four b4 the highest 
standard of protection 
rep wayne owens dutah who represents the area noted that 
the lab would have the capability to convert these lethal 
pathogens into aerosol form 
and it is this dangerous aerosol capability that is setting 
off alarm bells throughout the scientific community both 
internationally and in utah as to the public safety and wisdom of 
building the dugway facility owens said 
officially the united states shut down its biological weapons 
program which was based at fort detrick md in 1969 and 
announced that future research in the field would be limited to 
defensive purposes 
the united states is also a party to a 1972 treaty banning 
possession of biological weapons but the pact lacks enforcement or 
verification provisions 
welch and other administration officials repeatedly emphasized 
tuesday that the armys research program was only defensive and the 
united states would not use germ weapons 
it would be impossible for us to use biological weapons 
because we dont have them said welch we would never use 
biological weapons against anybody 
but legislators questioned welch closely about the army research 
program rep dante fascell dfla noted that the line between 
offensive and defensive biological agents seems fuzzy at best 
welch noted that while the lab would be constructed to a b4 
standard the armys planned experiments could be done in a b3 
lab the higher safety level is sought as a public protection he 
said 
army col walter busby who oversees the testing program said 
there are no plans to use genetically engineered material in 
the dugway facility 
some of the biological agents tested at dugway are shipped 
through regular mails officials said 
lynn hansen assistant director of the arms control and 
disarmament agency said the soviet union has an active research 
program to build germ weapons 
in contrast to the openness we have practiced regarding our 
military programs the soviets to date have never officially 
acknowledged even having a biological weapons program hansen 
said 
welch also said the us program is open to inspection but some 
parts of it remain secret because we do not want to expose our 
vulnerabilities in any area he said 
the officials testified at a joint hearing of the house foreign 
affairs arms control subcommittee the interior subcommittee on 
energy and the environment and the armed services subcommittee on 
military installations and facilities

you the astrological guide to health and diet and the 
astrological guide to marriage and family relations 
pierson said righter who never married predicted his own death 
he knew it would be difficult because the sun had gone into 
the sign of taurus a difficult period for an aquarius pierson 
said he admitted he probably wouldnt get through

members of illinois innovators and 
inventors or icubed say theyre just ordinary folks unlike the 
mad scientist stereotypes who often appear on the big screen 
through the groups exposure some members say they hope to 
change the image of inventors as eccentric hyperactive wildeyed 
and wildhaired people in unkempt clothing bursting with ideas but 
absentminded 
susan burgess of icubed which provides pointers and business 
information for inventors recently said the biggest misconception 
people have about inventors is theyre all weirdos and theyre 
not 
they dont all sit around in their basements and shout 
eureka all the time ms burgess said 
but group members do come up with novel ideas 
take robert biby of troy for instance who created a portable 
quiet air conditioner to keep police officers cool on hot 
stakeouts and theres mark derby of ofallon who invented a 
bearproof foodstorage box for campers 
author and group member dennis shinn who has compiled two books 
of 1001 names for your pet thats 2002 names said

dallas billionaire ross perot says he asked the 
rev jesse jackson to help free american hostages held in beirut 
and financed a 1985 trip by the democratic presidential contender 
according to a report published today 
perot said the national security council asked him to contact 
jackson to negotiate for the hostages release 
we had one hostage cia agent william buckley who knew too 
much and it was very important to get him back somebody asked who 
had a track record on getting somebody out of beirut and jackson 
was the only one who had perot told the dallas morning news 
perot said he met with jackson before the chicago civil rights 
leader left on his misson to london and rome perot paid jacksons 
expenses roughly 30000 and sent an associate along to make 
sure he had everything he needed 
the dallas businessman and philanthropist praised the democratic 
presidential candidate for his efforts 
the list of people who take a chance like this is very 
short perot said the list of people who have news conferences 
and shed tears is very long he never blinked he went 
an account of the deal between perot and jackson is contained in 
guts and glory the rise and fall of oliver north a new 
biography on the former nsc aide 
the biography by ben bradlee jr a reporter for the boston 
globe says that north and perot sought out jackson because he had 
successfully persuaded syria to release navy airman robert goodman 
in 1983 
on several other occasions north enlisted perot to help ransom 
american hostages in iran but nsc officials did not want to 
approach jackson for help perot said 
jackson told perot shortly after his return that one of the 
american hostages would be freed soon perot said a few days 
later jeremy levin the beirut bureau chief of cable news network 
escaped from his captors 
the guy did what he was asked to do by our government and he 
never grandstanded perot said his record is twofortwo 
in december 1986 the detroit free press reported that perot 
financed jacksons trip but perot would not confirm it at the time

the everglades will disappear if the melaleuca tree 
is not curbed but an experimental herbicide program could help 
stop the spread of the thirsty australian import experts said 
tuesday 
aerial spraying began last week in the loxahatchee national 
wildlife refuge in palm beach county but will take up to 10 months 
to evaluate said the parks chief biologist mark maffei 
the melaleuca was imported in 1906 to sow in the everglades 
which was then seen as just a mucky wasteland said biologist 
julia morton of the university of miami those bringing in the tree 
hoped it would turn the land into a productive timbering area 
the idea worked only too well and by the time scientists and 
the public realized the enormous environmental value of the 
everglades the melaleuca was beginning to wipe parts of the 
habitat out 
the thirsty australian tree soaks up water rapidly and thrives 
in fertilizerenriched waters that now flow into the everglades 
the proliferation of melaleuca crowds out the native plants which 
evolved in an era when the water had few nutrients 
its now invaded a halfmillion acres and 40000 acres are 
solid melaleuca ms morton said she refers to the tall thin 
trees with papery bark as weed trees 
if the tree is not stopped the everglades will eventually 
disappear under a forest of melaleuca biologists fear the tree is 
hard to control because it grows rapidly and because it has an 
unusual defense mechanism it sends out a load of airborne seeds at 
the first sign of heat from a fire or even the chop of an ax 
maffei said the melaleuca and the deteriorating water quality 
are the everglades two biggest environmental problems 
since 1985 loxahatchee and other evergladesarea parks have 
been using hack and squirt methods to control the tree said 
maffei 
that laborintensive process involves hacking each tree and 
injecting an herbicide trees are also uprooted and seedlings are 
pulled and burned 
the method has eliminated about 50000 melaleuca but maffei 
estimates hundreds of thousands remain in his park alone 
last weeks spraying test could be a first step in finding a 
cheaper faster method of controlling the melaleuca utility 
companies have been using the spray to control growth along their 
transmission lines with good results maffei said 
but a refuge is not a utility company and the effects of the 
aerial spraying must be carefully evaluated he said 
we have to worry about the other plants the wildlife and the 
period of time the chemical stays in the habitat maffei said 
something must be done however he said 
if we dont stop the melaleuca we are going to lose all the 
native habitat anyway said the biologist

israeli tanks and troops pushed 
unchecked through arab villages and towns to within four miles of 
syrian positions tuesday in israels largest incursion into lebanon 
in two years 
the tanks rolled north of israels selfdesignated security zone 
and backed up hundreds of heavily armed troops who combed lebanons 
rugged southern foothills searching for palestinian guerrillas 
lebanese police said syrian forces went on maximum alert as 
israeli fighters neared syrian troops no clashes were reported 
the operation was part of a push into the southeastern arkoub 
region that began monday evening the army said the incursion aimed 
at smashing antiisraeli guerrilla groups responsible for recent 
raids into northern israel 
in the predawn darkness before helicopter gunships began troop 
transport israeli artillery shelled areas around ain ata and 
several nearby villages no one was reported hurt 
then about 500 israeli soldiers armed with automatic weapons 
and rocket launchers were flown to the northern edge of ain ata a 
police spokesman said 
six israeli tanks and nine armored personnel carriers later 
rolled into the town about 1 miles north of israels 
selfdesignated security zone in south lebanon 
israel created the zone in 1985 after it withdrew its army 
which had occupied lebanon since 1982 
israeli troops conducted what appeared to be a housetohouse 
search in the town said the spokesman who spoke on condition of 
anonymity in line with standing regulations 
before the search began israeli troops sealed off all approaches 
to ain ata and five surrounding villages helicopters dropped 
leaflets calling on the population to cooperate in the search for 
guerrillas 
only villagers who work for the lebanese regular army were 
allowed to leave this reporter who lives in ain ata was also 
allowed to leave after he showed his associated press card 
israeli troops also entered five other arkoub villages policed 
by a norwegian battalion of the un peacekeeping forces in south 
lebanon and conducted a 10hour search for guerrillas un 
officials said 
they said the israelis finished the search in the midafternoon 
it was not clear whether anyone was detained 
later tuesday about 400 ground troops were seen entering 
lebanon from metulla in the far northeastern corner of israel 
some flashed v for victory signs others sang israeli 
nationalist songs 
a police spokesman said the syrian command ordered its estimated 
16000 troops in the nearby bekaa valley on maximum alert ain ata 
is four miles from syrian positions 
there have been no clashes but the syrians have their tanks 
dug in on hills overlooking the israeli operational zone the 
police spokesman said 
israeli prime minister yitzhak shamir said israels military 
operation in lebanon would not lead to a prolonged entanglement or 
provoke a confrontation with syria 
theres totally no danger of entanglement in lebanon shamir 
told israel radio i am certain that the israeli army took into 
account all the possibilities 
he described the operation as part of israels policy of 
conducting sweeps in south lebanon and added it is a usual 
action of watching and securing the area from attacks by 
terrorists 
in new york un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar said 
in a statement that he deplores this further violation of 
lebanese sovereignty he also called for the withdrawal of 
israeli troops 
in washington the reagan administration called for withdrawal 
of all foreign forces from lebanon 
lebanons central government in beirut its power eroded by 13 
years of civil war between prosyrian moslems and israelallied 
christians ordered its un ambassador rashid fakhoury to lodge 
a strongly worded complaint against the israeli action with the 
security council 
an israeli commander in lebanon who was not identified by name 
said on israel radio that he told soldiers 
this operation is not a nightlong operation in which you go 
in now and return in the morning dont be speedy in pressing the 
trigger but if you do shoot you mean it seriously and shoot in 
order to kill 
timur goksel spokesman for the united nations force in south 
lebanon said it appeared 1500 to 2000 israeli troops were 
involved in the operation but israeli sources said fewer than 
1000 were taking part 
the operation was israels largest in lebanon since february 
1986 when it sent more than 1000 troops and dozens of tanks into 
south lebanon to search for two soldiers captured by lebanese 
guerrillas the soldiers were never found 
the 100squaremile arkoub was the main base of yasser arafats 
palestine liberation organization guerrillas for crossborder 
attacks into israel before israels 1982 invasion of lebanon 
the region was then known as fatahland after arafats 
mainstream fatah guerrilla faction palestinian and leftist 
guerrillas have lately been active again in the arkoub and have 
conducted several raids into israel 
israeli officials say the increase in crossborder raids is 
linked to the fivemonth palestinian uprising in the 
israelioccupied west bank and gaza strip 
the israeli incursion followed two such raids last week in which 
two israeli soldiers and five guerrillas were killed 
syria lebanons main power broker maintains 25000 troops in 
the bekaa and northern lebanon under a 1976 mandate from the arab 
league to try to end lebanons civil war

president reagan said today that no policy 
or decision hes made has been influenced by astrology but the 
white house confirmed that nancy reagan follows astrology and 
checks it in terms of the presidents activities 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said the reagans were 
not happy about the sudden focus on astrology and the first couple 
they both feel its unfortunate and a distraction and hardly 
relevant to the business of government he said 
its true that mrs reagan has an interest in astrology 
fitzwater added she has for some time particularly following 
the assassination attempt in march of 1981 she was very concerned 
for her husbands welfare and astrology has been a part of her 
concern in terms of his activities 
fitzwater said he did not know whether the president himself had 
consulted any astrologers but noted that reagan has mentioned 
lucky numbers in speeches and has jokingly referred to abraham 
lincolns ghost living in the family quarters 
one newspaper said that mrs reagan had insisted on the date and 
time for the signing of the ussoviet treaty eliminating 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles after consulting an astrologer 
i dont know in any detailed sense if that is true fitzwater 
said 
meanwhile a los angeles astrologer asserted in an interview 
that reagan has used astrology throughout his career using 
astrology to pick his inauguration and other big events 
the astrologer joyce jillson also claimed she helped reagans 
first presidential campaign choose george bush as his running mate 
she did not provide specific evidence to back up her claim 
moreover she said she spent a lot of time at the white house 
after the assassination attempt 
asked about her statement fitzwater said i wouldnt be 
surprised we start hearing from all kinds of astrologers because of 
this he said they would be coming out of the walls 
former white house chief of staff donald t regan in a new 
book claims mrs reagan turned to astrologers to help determine 
the presidents schedule 
reagan asked about the reports while signing a proclamation in 
the roosevelt room said he was making it a policy not to comment 
on books by former white house staffers 
however he added no policy or decision in my mind has ever 
been influenced by astrology 
asked if astrology played a part in shaping his schedule reagan 
said with a smile you know im still looking for the fellas that 
tell me every day what im going to do 
on capitol hill house speaker jim wright was asked what he 
thought about the reagans using astrologists he replied with a 
grin its all right with me im glad he consults somebody 
we should check whether astrologer jeanne dixon recommended 
a veto of the trade bill added house majority whip tony coelho 
dcalif 
wright added its a full moon out there now thats what 
brings the crazies out 
current and former white house aides meanwhile expressed 
skepticism about the reports 
elaine crispen the first ladys press secretary said im not 
aware that any changes were made in the presidents schedule 
because of astrological forecasts 
asked whether the first family made decisions based on 
astrology she replied dont you read your horoscope 
lyn nofziger a former white house aide and associate of the 
reagans for more than two decades said i have never once heard 
her allude to astrology or to the stars or to the moon or to the 
sign of the ram 
he said the president liked to read his horoscope and laughed 
about it and kidded about it but i have never seen him take the 
stuff seriously 
i can never recall a single time when we did something 
politically because somebody said the stars are wrong added 
nofziger 
michael k deaver another longtime reagan associate and 
onetime deputy presidential chief of staff said im not 
interested in commenting on it 
ms jillson a los angeles astrologer whose daily horoscope is 
distributed to more than 100 newspapers by tribune media services 
said today that the reagans have regulary consulted with 
astrologers 
its an input that they receive i dont like to use the word 
rely ms jillson said 
the president has used astrology throughout his career using 
astrology to pick his inauguration and other big events look at 
when he holds his news conferences theyre usually during a full 
moon he chooses those times to do it she said 
ms jillson says she list politicians among her clientele 
including washington lawmakers aides and campaign officials she 
refused to reveal their names asked pointblank whether she had 
done consulting for the reagans she replied i never discuss 
clients 
however she said she was at the white house after reagans 
assassination attempt in 1981 and helped unidentified campaign 
officials in the choosing of bush as vice president in 1980 
i have been to the white house i spent a lot of time at the 
white house after the assassination attempt in march ms jillson 
said 
there was talk that i did charts for all eight vice 
presidential candidates i dont deny that i determined the only 
winnable choice was george bush 
regan is expected to document examples in which mrs reagan used 
astrology to determine the timing of speeches major events and 
announcements in his soontobereleased book the washington post 
and the philadelphia inquirer reported in todays editions 
the inquirer citing unidentified white house sources said mrs 
reagan insisted that the president and soviet leader mikhail 
gorbachev sign the inf treaty at 130 pm on dec 8 according to 
the sources mrs reagan was adamant about the time even when aides 
suggested rescheduling the event 
newsweek magazine and nbc news reported on monday that the 
scheduling of major events had sometimes been changed because the 
reagans said an astrologer had indicated another time would be 
better 
the president was aware of the practice and approved of it the 
post said 
mrs reagan consulted a number of astrologers including carroll 
righter a los angeles astrologer mentioned in reagans 1965 
autobiography wheres the rest of me the post said 
righter who prepared astrological stars for several hollywood 
stars died saturday at the age of 88

the state department warned american diplomats 
and businesses around the world tuesday to guard against terrorist 
retaliation for us military action against iran in the persian 
gulf 
the government of iran has practiced terrorism for the past 
nine years spokesman charles e redman said senior iranian 
officials in recent weeks have threatened terrorist acts in 
retaliation for us actions in the gulf 
the us takes all such threats seriously and has advised 
posts to take appropriate precautions redman said 
a warning was sent last wednesday to us diplomatic missions 
military installations and american companies operating abroad the 
government keeps the private concerns informed of security 
conditions because they also have been targets of antiamerican 
action 
state department officials speaking on condition of anonymity 
quoted the warning as saying the us government possesses 
information which leads it to believe that the government of iran 
will authorize terrorist attacks against us targets in the very 
near future we further believe that these attacks will be 
deliberately designed to cause us fatalities and or destruction 
to us facilities 
it said the middle east southeast asia and europe were the most 
likely areas for attack although no area can be completely 
precluded as an area of operation 
since the increase of us presence in the persian gulf notably 
the buildup of naval forces protecting shipping in the waterway 
american posts abroad have been under a general alert to guard 
against terrorism 
the sense of danger was heightened after april 18 when the 
united states sank or crippled several iranian ships and destroyed 
two oil platforms in the gulf reportedly killing 44 iranians the 
military action prompted iranian threats 
the day after the attack iranian president ali khamenei said 
we declare that we will forcefully respond to americas bullying 
in attacking oil platforms and killing innocent people 
interior minister ali akbar mohtashami said american 
interests in the world whether in europe western or middle 
eastern countries or even inside the united states should be 
directly attacked by the forces of the islamic revolution in the 
world and the hezbollah cells in various countries

and mphonyana mathibela as successful the hospital is in the huge 
black township outside johannesburg 
sophie mathibela mother of the girls said i feel so happy 
i want to sleep a little pray and thank god for all he has 
done 
a statement by the hospital said mpho the stronger of the two 
was doing well but mphonyana suffered extensive blood loss and was 
in critical condition it did not elaborate

md separated west german twins joined at the head the two boys 
benjamin and patrick binder survived and were released in march 
but are said to have some physical and mental problems

difficulties they were likely to face 
members of the medical team performed two operations on the 
girls last october in preparation for tuesdays surgery 
in those operations doctors partially clamped a shared major 
blood vessel in the twins heads in hopes that lesser blood vessels 
would take over its functions 
dr robert lipschitz chief of the surgical team told a news 
conference last friday chances for success were not good 
this is going to be a lengthy intricate operation which 
carries many dangers with it he said the prognosis is still 
very grave 
ms mathibela an unmarried 33yearold domestic worker who

once persuaded to see them i immediately accepted and loved my 
little gifts from god

appears to be developing normally and recently began to speak but 
mphonyana is slightly smaller and does not appear to be as 
advanced said officials at baragwanath the main hospital in 
soweto

a healthy breakfast helped lawrence 
students score higher on tests according to a study released 
tuesday 
about 1000 children in third through sixth grades from six 
schools were involved in the study conducted by two boston 
pediatricians 
alan meyers and michael weitzman of boston city hospital 
presented their findings tuesday in washington dc at the annual 
research meeting of the ambulatory pediatric association they hope 
to encourage colleagues to push for a national breakfast program 
only a handful of states besides massachusetts mandate the 
breakfast program said meyers we are trying to give these 
kids every break they can have it looks like there may be some 
benefit here 
massachusetts ordered communities with large numbers of poor 
families to begin school breakfasts in january 1987 the lawrence 
study began three months after the law took effect test scores 
from 335 children in the program were compared to scores from 688 
children who were not almost all the children were from poor 
families 
among the results 
test scores showed greater improvement for children in the 
breakfast program their scores went up 135 percent the following 
year compared to 11 percent for children not in the program 
children in the program were late or absent less frequently 
and breakfast eaters made fewer mistakes in the morning 
school lunches are now available to most us children but 
breakfast is offered to about 40 percent 
the study estimates about 600000 children skip breakfast every 
day cost is a problem the federal government spent 400 million 
in 1986 to serve breakfast to 33000 public school students meyers 
said

lines snaked outside federal immigration centers in cities 
around the country tuesday as thousands of undocumented aliens 
applied for legal residency status a day ahead of the deadline for 
the yearlong program 
to accommodate late applicants all 107 offices of the 
immigration and naturalization service will remain open until 
midnight wednesday the deadline for the yearlong amnesty program 
many district offices extended hours tuesday too 
in baltimore the line of applicants stretched around the block 
tuesday morning as people waited for the district office to open 
said louis d crocetti acting deputy district director 
two weeks ago crocetti said his office was processing 15 to 20 
applications a day now its more than 200 a day 
i just kept procrastinating but the time just caught up with 
me anna maldonado 26 of mexico said tuesday as she waited with 
750 other people at the ins office in downtown los angeles 
her sister carmen who applied for amnesty in january 
persuaded her to apply she said 
the applications are finally coming in said ins spokesman 
james jasey in new york where more than 500 applicants stood in 
line at midday outside the manhattan office 
as of sunday 133 million applications had been received 
according to the ins an additional 464000 people are seeking 
legal status under a separate program for seasonal agricultural 
workers the deadline for that program is nov 30 
applicants who file by the deadline also may request up to 60 
days for submitting other documents necessary to prove they have 
lived in the united states continuously since before jan 1 1982 
weve gotten dramatically busier in the last few days said 
roger nye chief legalization officer for the ins office in boston 
which handles applications from massachusetts rhode island and new 
hampshire 
our average throughout the program has been about 28 
applications a day but last week we had 828 which works out to 
over 160 a day and monday alone we had 329 applicants and i 
expect to surpass that by a good deal today 
in charlotte nc the ins office received 204 applications on 
monday it had received 454 applications in the preceding three 
weeks however about 90 percent of the applicants came from farm 
workers who have the longer deadline 
we knew it was going to happen this way said ana pardo 
chief immigration officer for north and south carolina 
in los angeles nearly 1000 central american applicants for 
political asylum lined up overnight at the main federal building 
mistakenly believing that they too faced a deadline 
i had to call up a couple of federal police officers to 
assist there was a mob outside guard walter bonner said 
tuesday it was like a stampede when we opened the doors at 5 
am 
the san francisco district which covers nothern california is 
handling close to 4000 applications a day up from a high of about 
600 a day in early february according to ins spokesman john r 
davis 
south florida immigration offices have mostly escaped long 
lines but local ins director perry rivkind said tuesday the number 
of applications had increased sharply recently 
its been running about 2000 a day he said but we have 
no problem taking applications about 110000 people have applied 
for amnesty there and rivkind said he expects the total to reach 
125000 
one reason the program has not had as great an impact in south 
florida is that the two most populous immigrant groups cubans and 
haitians had their situation legalized under special legislation 
that followed the 1980 mariel boatlift said rivkind 
nonetheless rivkind said he expected a lastminute push 
wednesday and promised well take everyone even if we have to 
wake em up in line

southwest african guerrilla leader sam nujoma 
said tuesday he had come to the united states to meet with the 
three presidential candidates and seek their support for south 
africas expulsion from the territory also known as namibia 
nujoma said he had been assured by campaign managers for 
democratic hopefuls michael dukakis and jesse jackson that he would 
meet with the two candidates during his stay here vice president 
george bush has not responded to his request for a meeting nujoma 
added 
nujoma who heads the southwest african peoples organization 
swapo also said he had received assurances from angola that 
namibias interests would be faithfully represented at negotiations 
being held in london tuesday between american south african cuban 
and angolan representatives 
the talks are designed to get cuba to pull out its 37000 
soldiers from angola in return for a pullout of south africas 
estimated 40000 troops from namibia it will be a package i am 
assured of this by the angolan government he said in an 
interview 
but south africa is doing all it can to strengthen its hold 
on the mineralrich territory stepping up a campaign of arson and 
bombing attacks against namibias predominantly black population of 
15 million nujoma said he accused south africa of burning down 
14 namibian church schools last month 
south africa has no intention whatsoever to leave namibia 
said nujoma who has lived in exile for 28 years the last 12 in 
angola the south africans will have to be forced out by the 
combined resistance of the namibian people and international 
pressure 
he commended the economic sanctions imposed by congress on south 
africa in 1986 and urged the next us administration to take 
further steps to pressure south africa into relinquishing namibia 
nujoma said he had requested a meeting with secretary of state 
george p shultz but had not received any response a state 
department official said she did not know of such a request 
the united states supports a south african pullout and an 
independent namibia but its contacts with swapo have been limited 
south africa is ruling namibia under an expired league of 
nations mandate in defiance of a 1978 un resolution which calls 
for namibian independence 
nujoma also said that should the united states be willing to 
supply swapo with weapons we will certainly accept it with great 
pleasure 
most of the groups arms and training come from the soviet 
union cuba yugoslavia angola and several other members of the 
organization of african unity he said 
iran india and the scandinavian countries supply humanitarian 
assistance to swapo nujoma said

the chairman 
of the joint chiefs of staff adm william j crowe jr said 
tuesday that iran remains a dangerous foe in the persian gulf 
despite heavy losses in battles with the navy two weeks ago 
i believe the iranians would clearly like to damage us to 
hurt us to humiliate us if they could crowe the nations top 
military commander said during a surprise visit to the gulf 
i think terrorism is one of the ways that they might try to do 
it its a very serious threat 
crowe presided at an awards ceremony on the sunbaked after deck 
of the 15000ton uss coronado 
he plans to visit at least three of the 28 other us warships 
in the area including the minedamaged 3700ton guided missile 
frigate samuel b roberts on his twoday tour 
iran has warned washington not to mount new military actions in 
the persian gulf and has threatened reprisals from anywhere in the 
world 
crowe was interviewed by the pentagon media pool 
the admiral said he was disappointed at the reagan 
administrations decision against sending six fast coast guard 
cutters to help patrol the gulf 
they would have been very useful in these shallow waters 
because we need fast boats with shallow drafts he said they 
are the best patrol boats in the world and the navy had no 
substitute 
crowe said he was aware of but could not confirm reports that 
iran may have 100 new c801 type chinese missiles a much more 
sophisticated missle than the landbased antiship chinese 
silkworms tehran has deployed so far 
he said the pentagon still had not decided if iran actually 
fired silkworms at us ships in the april 18 battle even though 
reports from ships in the area initially identified incoming 
missiles as silkworms 
president reagan had warned tehran that us forces would strike 
at coastal silkworm missile batteries if they were ever fired at 
american ships 
irans revolutionary guards have used a fleet of about 50 
swedishbuilt boghammer armed speed boats to harass shipping in the 
gulf 
tehran said on monday it has resumed boarding ships in the gulf 
to determine if they are carrying cargoes to iraq for use in the 
7yearold war with iran 
rear adm anthony a less commander of the joint task force 
middle east said the biggest headache is the opportunity they 
have to put mines out there 
nearly 50 mines have been found in the gulf this year but less 
said that no new ones have been detected recently by the fleet of 
allied mine sweepers that roam the gulf waterway through which 20 
percent of the worlds oil is shipped 
crowe 63 called the recent sea battle with iran unique in 
the annals of us navy history because of the exchanges of 
missile fire and praised the men for their performance 
in a brief ceremony on the afterdeck crowe presented awards 
that included the distinguished flying cross the bronze star and 
air medal to 13 pilots and crew members for bravery during the 
action april 18 
during the action american forces attacked two iranian oil 
platforms and sank or disabled six naval craft in raids described 
by washington as a measured response to hostile acts including 
the mining of gulf waters and firing on us helicopters

the chairman of the us joint chiefs of 
staff said tuesday that despite recent losses fighting the us 
navy iran remains a dangerous force whose threats of revenge 
cannot be dismissed 
they have a considerable capability and they have standoff 
missile capability which we are always concerned about adm 
william j crowe jr told reporters after a shipboard ceremony 
crowe decorated 13 us navy officers and men for actions during 
the clashes between us and iranian naval forces in the persian 
gulf april 18 
he said that although iran lost six naval craft including two of 
its best frigates during the daylong battles there are a number 
of threats that the iranian navy still represents 
i believe the iranians would clearly like to damage us to 
hurt us to humiliate us if they could i think terrorism is one of 
the ways they might try to do it its a very serious threat 
a blackpainted iranian mine inscribed with the famous world 
war ii slogan killroy was here was on display as crowe 
officiated at the awards ceremony in 103degree heat aboard the 
us navy flagship coronado 
meanwhile a convoy of usflagged kuwaiti tankers headed up 
the persian gulf toward kuwait the third in five days as the navy 
worked to get its escorted shipments of kuwaiti oil back on a 
regular schedule 
the convoys which had been averaging about seven a month since 
the first of the year were delayed for nearly two weeks after a 
us guided missile frigate hit a mine in the central gulf and mine 
sweepers later found and destroyed about a dozen more 
the mining of the frigate samuel b roberts on april 14 led to 
operation praying mantis a series of retaliatory strikes 
against iranian oil platforms and other targets four days later 
two platforms were destroyed and six iranian naval craft were 
sunk or disabled in the skirmishes in the southern gulf during the 
action the iranians fired five missiles at us ships but missed 
their targets 
a us navy helicopter carrying two crewmen was lost during the 
battle 
crowe interviewed by members of a pentagon news media pool 
said two weeks of technical analysis had not established the type 
of missiles fired at the three us warships 
us officials earlier said they were not chinesemade silkworm 
antiship missiles as electronic monitors aboard the american ships 
indicated at the time 
the admiral also said he could not confirm reports that iran had 
about 100 newer c801 chinese missiles a more advanced weapon than 
the 30yearold silkworms 
among those receiving citations from crowe were navy pilots who 
sank or disabled irans frigates sahand and sabaland and others 
who had roles in key parts of the actions awards included the 
distinguished flying cross the bronze star and the air medal for 
valor 
the 13 dressed in navy whites stood in a rank on the 
helicopter deck to receive their medals witnesses who included 
us ambassador to bahrain sam h zakhem said one of the sailors 
collapsed in the oppressive heat the most severe of any day this 
year 
the mine displayed on the 15500ton warship was one of nine 
found aboard the iran ajr an iranian landing craft that was 
disabled and captured by the navy last sept 21 after 
nightprowling us helicopters discovered it sowing mines in a 
shipping lane of the central gulf 
the mines the familiar russiandesigned horntype myam 
mine dating back to 1908 apparently were supplied to iran by 
north korea us sources have said 
during his visit to the gulf region crowe will inspect the 
minedamaged samuel b roberts now undergoing preliminary repair 
in a dubai shipyard the 3700ton twoyearold warship is to be 
returned to the bath maine shipyard where it was built for 
further work 
crowe also was expected to meet with top officials of gulf arab 
governments to explain the new us policy under which american 
warships will be permitted to respond to requests for help from 
nonus flag vessels under iranian attack

sen joseph r biden jr underwent surgery 
today to repair an aneurysm in an artery supplying blood to his 
brain according to a spokesman at walter reed army medical center 
hospital spokesman peter esker said biden was awake resting 
comfortably and talking with his family after the operation he 
said biden would be hospitalized for about 10 days 
biden 45 entered the washington military hospital on monday to 
prepare for the surgery the operation had been anticipated since 
february when doctors discovered the aneurysm while repairing a 
more serious aneurysm discovered earlier 
an aneurysm is a ballooning of an artery a weakness in the 
artery wall allows the pressure of the blood to force the artery to 
swell outward like a blister the danger is that the aneurysm will 
burst in the brain even a mild leakage can be dangerous and 
damaging

lying beneath a copy of the painting 
that made her face famous the sister of artist grant wood talks of 
the glory and criticism she shared as the model for his 
american gothic 
nan wood graham recognizeable despite the changes of nearly six 
decades recalled the events leading to her posing as the 
sternfaced farmers daughter for the american classic 
he was honest mrs graham now 88 and blind said of her 
brother explaining why people admire or dislike the work 
other painters say the portrait doesnt look like him 
because i painted what hes thinking they hide behind words 
because of their lack of talent she said 
but grant put it all down he learned his trade and put down 
what he saw 
mrs graham lives in a convalescent hospital on a quiet street 
of menlo park about 30 miles south of san francisco in an 
interview monday she remembered how american gothic changed 
her brothers life and her own 
wood who had developed a straightforward style in depicting the 
land and people of his native iowa was inspired by a house in the 
town of eldon 
driving by the house one day wood was taken with its sole 
decoration a secondstory window in the form of a simple gothic 
arch 
his main idea was to show the kind of people he thought 
would live in that kind of a house mrs graham said 
wood didnt want to disturb the residents so he asked the 
woods family dentist byron mckeeby 62 and nan then 30 to pose 
in what became one of americas bestknown paintings mckeeby 
dressed in overalls and holding a pitchfork and nan hair drawn 
back and wearing an apron over a plain dark dress adorned only by a 
cameo stand solemnly in front of the house the rural father and 
daughter appear as practical and as plain as the white wooden 
building 
but while the painting made woods reputation it also angered 
many iowa farmers 
they said if farmers really looked like that they better take 
to bootlegging mrs graham recalled 
she herself became the target of the farm wives wrath 
they thought that grant was making fun of them so they wrote 
to the newspaper all sorts of insults the worst one was that 
womans face would sour milk 
at her brothers suggestion nan answered the critics with a 
letter of her own 
i said that i posed for it and i was proud that i had well 
the situation changed immediately they were very apologetic and 
said they didnt mean what they said she said 
they even began bringing farm products up to us and 
invited grant to vacations on their farms the wood family was 
living in cedar rapids at that time 
to make up for the nasty comments wood later painted a portait 
of his sister as a present 
that was my reward mrs graham said he thought that 
secretly i was hurt 
she was a little but mrs graham has no regrets about posing 
she delights in the glory even though it meant being stopped 
frequently in the street as recently as several years ago 
mrs graham said she enjoyed fashion design and kind of went 
into the business selling her creations to a few satisfied 
customers 
im sorry i didnt take it up more seriously she said 
but i was too interested in a good time dates and running 
around 
six years before posing for american gothic nan wood 
married edward graham he invested in real estate and the grahams 
who had no children lived all over the country 
wood who continued to portray the people of the midwest died 
of cancer in 1942 american gothic is part of the permanent 
collection of the art institute of chicago

ousted moscow communist party boss boris n 
yeltsin returned to the spotlight tuesday to join a chorus of 
critics of the status quo and to support soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachevs economic restructuring drive 
in an article in the daily construction gazette yeltsin called 
on soviet workers to make the reforms work he also warned the 
kremlin leadership that it should be careful not to deceive the 
people and make them lose faith 
yeltsin who gained wide popularity in the capital with his 
raids on food stores and personal inspection of public transit was 
fired as moscow party leader on nov 11 after he criticized the 
slow pace of reforms during a closeddoor meeting of the party 
central committee 
his ouster sent a chill through the ranks of reformists who 
worried that yeltsins removal signaled strong resistance to 
gorbachevs efforts at allowing more openness about problems 
plaguing soviet society 
a week after losing the party job yeltsin was named first 
deputy chairman of the state construction committee which carries 
ministerial rank but falls far short of the influence he enjoyed as 
moscow party leader 
construction gazette sought yeltsins comments in connection 
with a frontpage article on woes in the soviet contruction 
industry which is having to conform to the same costcutting and 
efficiency measures as the rest of the economy under the 
perestroika or rebuilding campaign it made no reference to 
his former party job 
yeltsin told the newspaper that gorbachevs reforms are at a 
decisive phase and that the leadership should be careful to 
fulfill the hopes and expectations of the working people 
this hope must not be deceived or then it will not be easy to 
restore faith to the people to elevate them to great tasks 
yeltsin said 
success he said depends on the support of the wide masses of 
workers who hope for changes for the better in their lives and link 
them with perestroika 
he said the reforms could produce some longneeded improvements 
in the near future including better housing more modern medical 
facilities and more schools and kindergartens 
housing is still an acute problem in the soviet union where one 
family in five lives in dormitories or communal dwellings a party 
program has called for the construction of enough new housing so 
each family will have its own home or apartment by the year 2000 
the construction gazette article was the first masscirculation 
soviet publication to quote yeltsin since his departure from the 
party job last month the inaugural germanlanguage edition of the 
weekly moscow news carried an interview with him that publication 
is printed and distributed abroad 
yeltsins public return came a day after the party daily pravda 
published on its front page a letter from another government 
official who criticized his fellow party members for pursuing 
careerist ambitions over the ideals set down by soviet founder 
vladimir i lenin 
the official identified as v selivanov of the ministry of the 
aviation industry contended that party members have tainted 
lenins postulate that the party is the mind honor and 
conscience of our epoch 
he called for improvements within the party as well as industry 
and society as part of the restructuring campaign and introduction 
of more democracy in soviet life 
tuesday nights edition of the government newspaper izvestia 
carried a lengthy criticism of soviet industry and agriculture 
prominent author chingiz aitmatov said soviets continue to 
justify poor production with weak excuses about losses suffered 
during world war ii although countries like japan and west germany 
hit even harder long ago outdistanced soviet performance 
aitmatov a popular writer whose literary works attack 
totalitarianism said gorbachevs reforms hold out the only hopes 
for improving soviet farm and factory output 
the commentaries on democratic and economic reforms appear to be 
part of the preparations for next months party conference at 
which gorbachev will seek broader endorsement for his campaigns and 
likely remove some of the more conservative forces fighting the 
changes he has advocated 
the criticism of social and economic progress to date voiced by 
yeltsin selivanov and aitmatov and their calls for support for 
gorbachevs reforms embrace the leaders two main themes of 
greater openness and a wholesale rebuilding of the nation

president roh taewoo is ready to 
share power with the opposition in the national assembly after his 
partys losses in legislative elections party officials said 
tuesday 
officials of rohs democratic justice party said they wanted to 
reach an agreement with the opposition soon so the new national 
assembly can hold its opening session around may 20 
we would favorably consider an opposition demand that the 
parliamentary leadership be shared by parties according to their 
assembly seats the governing partys floor leader kim 
yoonhwan said after meeting with senior party leaders 
opposition candidates made a strong showing in legislative 
elections a week ago stripping the government party of its 
parliamentary majority for the first time in south koreas modern 
history 
the three opposition parties took 164 seats in the 299member 
assembly rohs party won 125 seats 25 shy of a simple majority a 
handful of independent candidates also won seats 
kim who was appointed floor leader in a shakeup of the partys 
leadership on monday said formal discussions of the new assemblys 
leadership could start after opposition parties hold their national 
conventions next week 
kim said the government party wants to hold the speakership but 
would cede the two vice speakers posts to the opposition 
traditionally only one vice speakers post has been left to the 
opposition 
the chairmanships of 13 assembly committees should also be 
shared with the opposition kim said in the past all committees 
were headed by governing party members 
after the legislative elections the president said he would 
humbly accept the outcome he added he would work with the 
opposition to continue to carry out his promises for democratic 
reforms 
in a first move to reorganize the government camp after the 
election roh replaced the head of his party with a moderate senior 
politician other senior party posts also were filled with 
moderates 
government officials said roh was expected to shake up his 
cabinet probably next week but leave prime minister lee hyunhae 
in place 
opposition leader kim daejung whose party for peace and 
democracy emerged as the no 1 opposition force in the elections 
said he would like to delay debates on controversial issues if they 
would disrupt the 1988 olympics in seoul

federal officials on wednesday will kick off 
an intensive threeweek campaign to alert americans about aids 
focused around the mailing of a pamphlet on the deadly disease to 
every household in the nation 
health and human services secretary otis r bowen surgeon 
general c everett koop and other top administration health leaders 
scheduled a news conference to officially unveil the booklet whose 
contents were being kept secret tuesday 
the promotional campaign including television spots and 
posters in each of the nations post offices is designed to alert 
americans to be looking for the historic pamphlet when it starts 
showing up in mailboxes may 26 
it will be the first time the us government has sent a health 
advisory directly to every american with a mailing address 
the secrecy surrounding the actual content of the document stems 
from decision by department officials to apply a strict reading to 
congressional directions ordering that a national mailing be 
undertaken by june 30 
that language in the omnibus budget bill covering the current 
fiscal year said the mailing was to be prepared and distributed 
without necessary clearance of the content by any official 
organization or office 
although health department officials have been wary of 
discussing preparation of the document they have acknowledged that 
they interpreted the wording to mean that the pamphlets content 
should not be subject to prior scrutiny either by the white house 
or congress itself 
congress called for a similar mailing last year but with less 
explicit language that project was never completed in part 
because of objections raised by some white house officials 
one of the reasons given was that because president reagan had 
just appointed a white house aids commission to make 
recommendations on overall aids policy it would be appropriate for 
the panel to review any mailing 
however the commission did not get into the issue at the time 
on grounds that it was just beginning its work and was not ready to 
examine specific inititives the panel was not asked to review the 
current mailing and did not ask to be involved 
the commission has not formally or informally been involved in 
the planning or preparation or writing of this booklet spokesman 
tom brandt said tuesday in an interview 
he said retired navy adm james watkins and the panels 
executive director are familiar with some elements of it but 
like everybody else in town they are waiting to see it and hope it 
is successful 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is a contagious 
incurable isease that attacks the bodys immune system rendering 
it incapable of resisting other diseases and infections the virus 
most often is spread through close contact with blood blood 
products or semen from infected persons 
the diseases chief victims have been homosexual men and 
intravenous drug users with a small percentage of cases attributed 
to transfusions of contaminated blood heterosexual contact and 
spread from infected pregnant women to their offspring 
as of april 21 aids had been diagnosed in about 59500 
americans of whom more than half or about 33000 have died since 
june 1981 according to the cdc 
hhs spokesman chuck kline said the pamphlet will be as 
complete as it can be within a relatively constrained format 
discussing aids in terms of how you can get aids how you cant get 
aids the various precautions that can be taken beginning of 
course with avoiding risky behavior 
he said there are sections on aids and children aids and 
dating babies with aids and on people with aids and the rights 
they have and the obligations owed to them 
asked specifically whether it will mention condoms kline said 
this particular mailer addresses all aspects of aids and how it 
is communicated and how one can avoid or if not avoid at least 
provide the best protection for the circumstances 
since 1986 when he issued a 36page surgeon generals report on 
aids koop has been the administrations most vocal advocate of 
condom use for sexually active people who are not in monogomous 
relationships 
that booklet has been distributed to an estimated 19 million 
americans many via mail from individual members of congress who 
requested copies to mail to their constituents the basic themes 
laid down in the 1986 report have been repeated in subsequent 
public health service documents 
the outspoken koops planned presence at the wednesday 
announcement was an indication the mailing will adhere to the 
approach he has been taking on aids education and prevention 
his spokesman jim brown declined to say what role koop had 
played in preparation of the mailer or whether it will state the 
surgeon generals position on condom use 
it would be really difficult to leave out the surgeon general 
who has been the voice of this administration speaking out on aids 
since he was first asked to do the 1986 report by the 
president brown said in an interview 
brown noted that dr robert windom the no 2 official in the 
health department and hhs undersecretary donald newman will be 
making a simultaneous announcement of the mailing wednesday in 
geneva at the world health organization 
we discovered when we were in london in january for an aids 
conference attended by health ministers from almost every country 
in the world that there was a great deal of concern about what the 
united states was doing brown said we thought this was a good 
opportunity to show them what were doing now in addition to all 
the things we have done before

declaring that americas cultural literacy 
is at stake federal arts agency chief frank hodsoll said tuesday 
he will make a nationwide tour to urge educators to give elementary 
school child at least 4 hours of arts instruction weekly 
hodsoll also wants to require high school students to complete 
the equivalent of two full years of art courses before they can 
graduate twice as much as education secretary william j bennett 
proposed last december as part of his model high school curriculum 
if hodsoll has his way all junior high school students will be 
required to spend at least 15 percent of the school year studying 
the arts exclusive of english studies with special emphasis on 
design and the media arts such as television and movies 
the proposals aimed at making the arts an integral part of the 
school curriculum from kindergarten through the 12th grade were 
contained in a 173page report issued tuesday by the national 
endowment for the arts on the state of arts education in america 
the problem is basic arts education does not exist in the 
united states today concluded the endowment an independent 
federal agency which underwrites a wide variety of artistic 
projects with a current budget of 1677 million 
the report argued that the arts are no less important than 
reading writing and arithmetic by helping youngsters understand 
civilization develop creativity learn communications skills and 
make critical choices about what is good and bad 
nevertheless the report said many americans still view the 
arts as a subject not worthy of serious study and sometimes as 
potentially threatening or even blasphemous moreover it said 
school administrators cannot agree on what arts education is 
it cited a survey conducted three years ago which found that 61 
percent of american adults had not attended a live cultural 
performance or visited an art gallery or museum in the previous 
year 
hodsoll the endowment chairman told a news conference he will 
begin a series of regional meetings around the country next week to 
campaign for expanded arts instruction in the schools 
the first session will be held monday in st louis where 
hodsoll will confer with state and local education and arts 
officials from missouri oklahoma arkansas texas nebraska and 
kansas conferences tentatively are planned for next fall in new 
england the south and the west coast 
hodsoll acknowledged that his stress on the arts will be a 
problem in some school districts that put primary emphasis on 
preparing students to meet foreign competition in science and 
technology 
but he and the endowment report noted that the hightech 
japanese have made the arts a basic part of their school 
curriculum hodsoll argued that study of the arts helps us to be 
masters not servants of technology 
the endowment study commissioned by congress in 1985 and titled 
toward civilization prescribed stiffer curriculum 
requirements improved teacher training and credentials standards 
testing and evaluation to provide all students not just the 
talented or collegebound with a thorough education in their 
artistic heritage 
without knowledge and understanding of such supreme 
achievements we are culturally illiterate the report said 
the report proposed that high schools require two years of art 
courses or other approved courses that incorporate the arts for a 
graduation diploma and that they offer optional arts courses for 
talented students who want them 
it said school administrators might consider extending the 
school day to seven periods to accommodate the new requirements

president reagan said tuesday the government 
will not tolerate informal quotas that exclude some people of asian 
and pacific heritage from attending colleges or universities 
reagan made the statement at a signing ceremony in the roosevelt 
room for a proclamation designating the week beginning may 8 as 
asianpacific american heritage week 
i know theres a growing concern that some universities may be 
discriminating against citizens of asian and pacific heritage 
accepting a lower percentage of these applicants than get admitted 
from other groups despite their academic credentials reagan 
said he did not cite any examples of discrimination 
he said the denial of access to higher education when a person 
is entitled to it based on merit is a repudiation of everything 
america stands for 
let everyone be clear especially all recipients of federal 
education funds that the use of informal exclusionary racial 
quotas or any practice of racial discrimination against any 
individual violates the law is morally wrong and will not be 
tolerated 
reagan also recalled that a citizen of chineseamerican descent 
vincent chin was beaten to death in detroit several years ago by 
two men enraged over japanese car imports 
political differences over trade policy are one thing 
reagan said and we can debate them but racially tainted appeals 
cross a very dangerous line 
theyre an affront to this country and they threaten the 
tranquility and safety of all of us here at home

development of rural america its small towns 
and farms should rest on diversification and the energies of local 
people a report by the agriculture department said tuesday 
roland r vautour undersecretary for small community and rural 
development said cooperative federal efforts now under way are 
helping rural communities regain economic stability 
vautour said rural communities suffered from inflation in the 
late 1970s global economic recession and farmland value losses in 
the early 1980s and from a rise in foreign agricultural production 
in the past rural economic development has been dependent on 
farm policy and income he said we now recognize that the 
future growth and stability of the rural economy is dependent on 
diversification at the local level both in farm production and in 
the other businss segments of community and state economies 
the 19page report itself added the current federal 
initiative on rural development stresses the need for rural 
america to look within for development possibilities americas 
small and rural communities need to realize there are simply not 
enough branch plants of major manufacturers to go around rural 
america must draw upon its own strengths and use them to promote 
development 
field hearings are being planned so that vautour can listen to 
the needs and concerns of the local officials residents students 
teachers business people and senior citizens the report said

ten days of andy warholmania ended tuesday when 
sothebys auction house brought down the last gavel on its sale of 
the late artists personal collection the grand total 253 
million 
the sale which featured more than 10000 items owned by warhol 
attracted an estimated 60000 people to the sotheby galleries and 
set tongues wagging and jaws dropping throughout the art world 
proceeds from the auction vastly exceeded sothebys official 
preauction estimate of 9 million to 13 million while auction 
house officials admitted that they purposely underestimated the 
collections value they expressed surprise over the extent of the 
miscalculation 
our feeling when we figured the estimates was that we wouldnt 
add any warhol factor said diana d brooks president of 
sothebys north america i think what were seeing today is an 
indication not only of the warhol factor but of a very strong art 
market 
for whatever reason buyers were willing to pay dearly for just 
about anything owned by warhol who died in february 1987 and owned 
many many things 
sales figures included 2640 for three plastic watches bearing 
the likenesses of fred flintstone judy jetson and gumby 23000 
for a pair of cookie jars 55000 for a set of salvador dali ear 
clips and 605000 for a roy lichtenstein painting sailboats 
proceeds from the auction go to the andy warhol foundation for 
the visual arts which was established by the artist to support 
cultural institutions 
the highestpriced item at the sale was an untitled 1967 
painting by cy twombley that fetched 990000 a record for a work 
by that artist it was one of many records set during the marathon 
sale 
works of art routinely sold for double or triple or more 
their estimated value a david hockney drawing of warhol valued at 
60000 to 80000 sold for 330000 an example of the warhol 
factor working overtime 
its a joke to attempt to buy here complained one toronto 
art dealer geert von der veen i dont think there are many 
dealers who could touch those prices or want to youd look 
crazy 
i think the prices have no relation to the value said 
another dealer ames brown of manchester vt the warhol 
imprimatur is just inflating prices irrationally 
von der veen and brown both said that private collectors not 
art dealers were doing most of the buying at the warhol auction 
something sothebys officials disputed 
for those of us who buy for resale or for investment its 
not a very attractive auction said brown 
but for others the warhol auction was exceedingly attractive 
its not an exaggeration to say this was a historic event 
said jeffrey deitch vice president of the citibank private banking 
group who buys art on behalf of bank clients 
a lot of the prices sound high to the casual bidder but 
theyre not insanely high deitch said for instance in the 
auction of the warhol furniture many of the pieces went for what 
youd pay for new furniture 
anyway he said i think it sends an interesting signal that 
our culture values these things and i think that as a culture we 
can feel very good that works of art are valued to this extent 
deitch predicted that anything associated with warhol would 
continue to escalate in value as more people come to appreciate the 
artist who remains controversial in death as he was in life 
its just beginning he said just beginning

a predominantly white suburb should have the 
right to control its own possessions by barring nonresidents 
from its parks a lawyer for the town said tuesday 
a threejudge state court of appeals panel heard arguments on an 
appeal of a 1986 ruling overturning a referendum in dearborn in 
november 1985 the voters in the town located on detroits western 
border had approved a measure that would ban nonresidents from 35 
of its 37 parks 
the american civil liberties union challenged the law saying it 
effectively discriminated against blacks from neighboring detroit 
william saxton representing dearborn said tuesday that the 
ruling should be overturned because the same argument could be used 
to strike down a number of other laws that had potential 
discriminatory effects 
the plaintiffs are making an abhorrent argument he said 
in an interview outside the hearing the city has a right to 
control its own possessions 
but wayne state university law professor robert sedler who 
argued in behalf of the aclu said the ordinance is going to make 
the dearborn parks all white 
however he added the case is limited and should apply only to 
dearborn parks 
our view is a very narrow one he said 
in september 1986 wayne county circuit judge marvin stempien 
ruled that the ban was unconstitutional because of its possible 
discriminatory effect and its proposed random checks of park users 
for identity documents 
citing two of parks that were particularly close to 
predominantly black detroit neighborhoods the judge said the 
impact of the nonresident provisions is to deny the use of 
both ford woods park and crowley park to almost every potential 
black user within the service area 
the 1980 census showed that of about 90000 people living in 
dearborn fewer than 100 were black detroits population at the 
time was about 63 percent black 
nearly a year before the ruling the dearborn city council voted 
43 to reject the parks ordinance but a petition drive put the 
matter on the nov 5 1985 election ballot and residents approved 
it in a 17790 to 13976 vote 
attorneys said an appeals ruling may be made within 120 days

alpha fraternity house feb 12 tests revealed callahan had four 
times the legal amount of alcohol in his body when he slipped into 
a coma

university investigation continues and that the 15 students named 
in the indictment could face school charges the most serious being 
expulsion 
also on tuesday rutgers football player robert lowther of 
wadsworth ohio died in a car accident in which the driver had 
twice the legal amount of blood alcohol in his system rockoff said

wayne had veered into oncoming traffic and crashed headon into a 
truck rockoff said 
tests on speidel who remained hospitalized in critical 
condition tuesday showed he had a blood alcohol level of 0253 
percent rockoff said people are considered legally intoxicated in 
new jersey when blood alcohol content reaches 010 percent 
speidel turned 21 on tuesday making him younger than the legal 
drinking age monday rockoff said

the nations food labeling and information 
system is confusing inadequate and in need of an overhaul 
according to a congressional report released tuesday 
the food information system lacks common criteria in 
addition controversies surround the nutritional issues that 
underlie regulatory decisions the general accounting office said 
in its report 
consumers need the clearest most consistent information 
possible the report said but the current system sends 
confused signals to consumers it said 
the report was requested by rep john dingell dmich chairman 
of the house energy and commerce committees oversight and 
investigations subcommittee dingell asked gao to investigate 
conflicting regulations on the use of cheese substitutes in frozen 
pizza toppings 
the agriculture department which regulates meattopped frozen 
pizza requires disclosure on the front panel of the pizza box if

authorities accused a computer operator 
from a company that helps run the state lottery of forging a 
winning 152 million ticket and another man with trading it in for 
the jackpot 
mark s herbst 33 of harrisburg was arraigned tuesday less 
than a week after he traded in the ticket for the first 469989 
installment of the prize from a super 7 drawing last july 15 he 
was jailed in lieu of 50000 bail 
jailed in lieu of bail monday night was computer operator henry 
arthur rich also 33 of harrisburg who tried to flee arresting 
officers said 
both men were charged with theft by unlawful taking theft by 
deception criminal conspiracy and forgery said robert gentzel a 
spokesman for state attorney general leroy zimmerman rich also was 
charged with unlawful use of a computer and tampering with public 
information 
if convicted herbst could be jailed for up to 31 years and 
fined 70000 zimmerman said rich could face 40 years in prison 
and 90000 in fines 
there was no current evidence of participation by others or 
of other fraudulent tickets being turned in either here or in the 
state of delaware where rich had access to that states mainframe 
lottery computer zimmerman said at a news conference 
zimmerman alleged rich used a computer at his firm control data 
corp to identify unclaimed jackpots and to print a copy of the 
unclaimed winning ticket which he gave to herbst to cash in he 
contended rich obtained some security codes and other information 
about the winning ticket from the lotterys main computer which he 
had access to as a troubleshooter 
rich was responsible for troubleshooting the lotterrys main 
computer 
spokesmen at control data said tuesday they had been told by the 
state revenue department not to comment and gov robert p casey 
said late in the day that he had postponed final approval of a 
proposed contract renewal for control data pending review of 
security safeguards 
when herbst claimed the jackpot thursday he said he had been 
using the ticket as a bookmark and checked the numbers after seeing 
a newspaper story about the unclaimed prize 
terri lafleur associate editor of gaming and wagering business 
magazine said security violations in lottery games are rare 
because of the precautions 
james scroggins the lotterys executive director said some of 
his colleagues had doubts about the ticket even before herbst 
received his check the doubts centered on the finding that the 
bogus ticket was printed on a blank from a scranton lotteryticket 
outlet while a computer check showed the actual winner was sold in 
bucks county 
scroggins said he decided to award the prize because past 
discrepancies of that type were explained by merchants lending 
blank tickets to other sellers 
less than an hour after herbst left a news conference however 
the officials decided the ticket wasnt real and contacted 
zimmerman later that day the revenue department which operates 
the lottery asked herbsts bank to stop payment on the check and 
state prosecutors asked the bank to stall herbst if he tried to 
withdraw the money 
scroggins said herbst was not unlike any other big winner id 
ever seen he was very nervous 
zimmerman said agents from his office confronted herbst on 
sunday and herbst admitted he knew the ticket was not genuine 
according to an affidavit used to obtain arrest warrants herbst 
also told the agents rich was expecting 5000 from him monday 
on monday night zimmerman said herbst gave rich 5000 
provided to him by investigators rich was armed and tried to flee 
when agents moved in but was captured without incident zimmerman 
said 
scroggins said additional security measures which he refused to 
disclose would have eventually uncovered the forgery 
this is the second fixing case to plague the pennsylvania 
lottery the april 24 1980 drawing of the daily number was fixed 
by altering pingpong balls used to pick the winning digits 
the socalled 666 case named after the winning numbers also 
resulted in tighter security for the televised drawings scroggins 
said new procedures would also be implemented because of the new 
case

leftist guerrillas on tuesday 
imposed a nationwide road transport ban that forced workers to walk 
to their jobs or pay high fares to truck drivers 
the ban the third this year reduced traffic on intercity roads 
and highways by up to 90 percent according to several dispatchers 
and broadcast reports from the provinces city traffic appeared to 
be about a third of that on a normal day 
only two privately owned city buses were seen in a tour of the 
capital and the surrounding area several stateowned buses with 
soldiers aboard for protection were providing transport as were 
some army trucks 
but most salvadorans either walked or boarded overcrowded 
pickups and vans converted to public transport by their owners the 
drivers charged an average of two colones 40 cents per trip or 
about six times the average bus fare 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front who 
have waged an 8year campaign against the usbacked government 
warned drivers to heed the measure they did not say how long it 
would last 
on the clandestine radio venceremos the rebels said they were 
taking down license plate numbers of vehicles violating the ban and 
would retaliate with sabotage 
the guerrillas said the ban was a response to increased 
repression by security forces 
police sources who spoke on condition of anonymity for security 
reasons said a taxi was commandeered then burned tuesday morning 
by urban commandos in northeastern san salvador 
during transport bans in february and march four people died 
11 were wounded and 15 vehicles were burned or shot 
as was the case during the previous bans the guerrillas on 
tuesday stepped up their sabotage against the stateowned electric 
utility bombs toppled several utility posts or transmission 
towers cutting electricity to wide swatches of this nation of 5 
million 
gen adolfo blandon chief of the joint chiefs of staff said 
all leaves for members of the 56000strong armed forces had been 
canceled to provide security along the nations thoroughfares 
several citizens condemned the transport ban 
the ones most hurt are the humble people who use public 
transport said a middleaged man who refused to give his name 
for fear of the guerrillas

theres a world of difference between 
riding a thoroughbred horse and driving a car but there is also 
one similarity let either one get out of control and you have a 
problem 
these horses are a little bit crazy said lisa c schulte a 
former history teacher who is owner of hawkeye hill racing school 
students who have had a horse run off with them say its like 
being in a formula one race car with the throttle stuck open very 
little steering and no brakes 
about 70 percent of those in the hawkeye hill riding program 
wash out because they cant master the powerful highspirited 
animals from the saddle but since they also study stable 
management before planting their feet in the stirrups employment 
after graduation usually isnt a problem the school has a 40page 
list of stables looking for help 
these are people who write or call in orders and say i need 
a groom or an exercise rider said the 43yearold ms schulte 
who started the school in 1979 
the 68acre complex has two training tracks barns a dormitory 
and a classroom ten groups of 12 students per year take a home 
correspondence course before arriving for the minimum onemonth 
course in exercise riding how to give racehorses their workouts 
that many students hope will lead up the ladder to a jockeys life 
the stateaccredited campus is an alternative to the traditional 
school for jockeys the school of hard knocks people wanting to 
become jockeys usually are handed a pitchfork instead of the reins 
and have to work their way up 
unless you have good connections such as parents who are 
trainers or who are wealthy horse owners its very hard to get a 
job at the track ms schulte said so this gives them a good 
foundation of handson experience with thoroughbred race horses 
brad hopp 18 of kahoka mo graduated from the school in 
march and was back this week to prepare for his test to get an 
apprentice jockey license 
i was getting run away with quite a bit and now i feel i can 
ride about anything out there said hopp whose family owns 
thoroughbreds there was my way of riding and their way or 
riding and theirs was better 
jane evans said the program would help her train the 
thoroughbreds she owns at her farm near carlisle mass unlike most 
of the students who are in their late teens or 20s mrs evans has 
several grown children 
summer and fall are the busiest times at the school 50 miles 
north of louisville but business picks up around derby time this 
years kentucky derby is set for saturday 
many of the foreign students come especially for the derby 
ms schulte said they come from europe and south america 
theyve also come from the middle east theyre wanting to learn 
about american ways of training race horses and riding and about 
american racetracks 
the school has 50 horses graded in riding difficulty from the 
ones you could put your grandma on to the real hairraising 
horses ms schulte said 
the only thing harder to handle than an outofcontrol horse 
might be a class of junior high school students the former teacher 
said 
get you about 30 of them and put the students in a situation 
where they dont want to be she said after that 
thoroughbreds are a challenge but a pleasure

more areas have failed to meet federal clean 
air standards for ozone a major component of smog but carbon 
monoxide pollution has cleared up slightly the evironmental 
protection agency said tuesday 
epas annual list of areas violating national clean air 
standards for the two pollutants shows 68 cities not meeting the 
ozone goals last year an increase of six from the year before and 
59 out of compliance for carbon monoxide a decrease of six 
twenty cities appeared on both lists so 107 cities and rural 
areas containing 135 million people according to the national 
clean air coalition violate one standard or both the 24 largest 
metropolitan areas were on one or both lists leaving kansas city 
the largest area in compliance 
both pollutants are influenced by the weather and for that 
reason epa uses more than a years data in judging compliance 
three years for ozone and two years for carbon monoxide the ozone 
tabulations cover the years 198587 and the carbon monoxide 198687 
if for example only 1986 data had been used 50 cities would 
have flunked the carbon monoxide test if 1987 readings alone had 
been used 37 cities would have failed but to be in compliance a 
city must make the cut both years 
the influence of weather on ozone is more pronounced 
pittsburgh detroit grand rapids mich and richmond va are 
listed as violators this year but not last year all four were on 
the 1986 list using 19831985 data 
the relevant ozone readings for those four areas for 19851987 
are similar to those for 19831985 possibly because their summers 
were similar in 1983 and 1987 epa spokesman chris rice said 
we had a hot dry summer in the east which tends to push up 
ozone levels rice said it was much like the summer of 1983 
except confined to the east 
this years lists are perhaps more important than most because 
congress will use them in deciding if and how to revise the clean 
air act while revisions are being considered congress barred epa 
from imposing penalties on any noncomplying areas before aug 31 
epa contends that it may not impose penalties for sheer failure 
to meet numerical standards but must do so for areas that fail to 
work toward compliance penalties for at least 14 areas were held 
up by the congressional action 
those penalties can be the suspension of federal highway sewer 
and air pollution program aid 
aug 31 is now the deadline for complying with the standards 
which no one expects or believes possible for many cities various 
proposals in congress would extend the deadlines according to the 
severity of pollution and efforts needed to clean it up 
sen george mitchell dmaine sponsor of one bill that has 
cleared the senate environment committee said in a statement the 
new report demonstrates that the ozone nonattainment problem 
continues to worsen and that his bill is needed 
he was echoed by richard ayres chairman of the national clean 
air coalition a grouping of environmental and other organizations 
who said the new data confirm that we are no longer winning the 
battle against air pollution and we need a revitalized clean air 
act 
carbon monoxide interferes with the oxygencarrying capacity of 
the blood ozone the major component of smog worsens breathing 
problems 
motor vehicles are involved in producing both pollutants 
carbon monoxide is emitted directly in the exhaust as cars 
built before 1981 when the latest emission standards took effect 
are retired urban air should get cleaner regardless of the weather 
epa says average carbon monoxide concentrations have been 
improving by about 4 percent a year since the mid1970s the agency 
expects all but a handful of cities four to six according to 
rice eventually to meet clean air standards for carbon monoxide 
without special effort 
ozone compliance is more difficult in part because it is not 
emitted in exhaust 
ozone is formed by chemical reactions in sunlight between oxides 
of nitrogen still another pollutant emitted by all fossil fuel 
combustion including vehicle fuels and volatile compounds like 
gasoline vapor both from tailpipes and from normal evaporation in 
fuel systems 
these reactions can proceed downwind of the source of the raw 
materials which accounts for the presence of several rural 
counties five of them in maine on the ozone noncompliance list 
ozone raw materials for the maine counties were emitted somewhere 
upwind in the bostonwashington corridor 
though many areas will improve as old cars are junked far more 
will remain out of compliance than will be true for carbon 
monoxide epa believes some 25 or more cities will be unable to 
comply with tighter controls on stationary sources of other 
nongasoline compounds like solvents epa says 
by a wide margin the los angeles area is again worst for ozone 
pollution in part because of the mountains around the city that 
keep polluted air from moving away the area has peak ozone 
concentrations nearly three times the standard and an estimated 143 
days of violation per year 
the second worst city is bakersfield calif with peaks 50 
percent above the standard and 35 days of violations per year four 
other california cities san diego fresno modesto and visalia 
have more than 10 days above the standard 
outside of california only houston atlanta and philadelphia 
have more than 10 days of violation per year

the united states is pleased by recent 
measures of cooperation between south africa and mozambique the 
state department said tuesday 
specifically the department praised a new agreement between the 
two countries for electric power supply from the cabora bassa dam 
in mozambique to the eastern part of south africas transvaal 
province 
we are pleased by the recent steps taken by the governments of 
mozambique and south africa to reduce tensions and expand 
cooperation through such means as restoring the cabora bassa 
electrical power system which links the two countries said 
spokesman charles redman 
he added that we encourage both governments to follow through 
on this and other efforts to work toward accommodation 
south africa is also negotiating to train and equip as many as 
three battalions of mozambican troops according to a south african 
official quoted in a new york times report from maputo 
the official timo beukes said the training would cost about 
14 million annually and south africa would also supply ration 
packs vehicles uniforms radios and mine detectors 
the reported agreement constitutes a reversal of south africas 
traditional support for the renamo guerrilla group seeking to 
overthrow the leftistoriented government of joaquim chissano 
in cape town roland darroll a spokesman for the department of 
foreign affairs denied that south africa was negotiating to train 
mozambican troops 
he did say that south africa was considering nonlethal military 
aid for mozambique to help protect the hydroelectric project but 
that no decision had been made yet

after years of competitive feuding with cable 
television the broadcast networks and hollywood are looking at the 
rapidly growing medium as an opportunity rather than an enemy 
as part of that trend the national broadcasting co broke into 
the cable industry monday by buying a cable channel to produce 
business and sports programs 
long the poor cousin of broadcast television cable has grown 
into a 12 billion a year industry that is steadily siphoning 
viewers from the networks and cutting into hollywoods profits 
now the broadcast networks are looking at cable as a way to 
reclaim some of that audience with their existing resources like 
nbc with its news and sports operations 
and hollywood is seeing in cable a new source of programming 
revenue and a place where producers can work more creatively 
weve been waiting 20 years for this said john malone 
president of telecommunications inc 
tci the nations largest cable company which is buying tulsa 
oklabased tempo enterprises inc has agreed to sell nbc a part 
of tempo a cable outlet carried on systems with 12 million 
subscribers 
nbc president bob wright said the move was an important step 
in our efforts to broaden nbcs business base he said that while 
helping the cable industry the venture will strengthen nbc the 
nations toprated broadcast network 
capital citiesabc inc which owns abctv has already moved 
into cable it owns 80 percent of the espn cable network 
with hollywood as a backdrop the national cable television 
associations annual convention which ended here tuesday provided 
a convenient opportunity for bigname movie producers like steven 
spielberg to make a pitch to the nations largest cable companies 
they view cable as the thing of the future said james s 
cownie president of heritage communications of des moines iowa 
and chairman of the cable association they look at cable as a 
hybrid of the little screen and the big screen and something that 
is not restricted editorially or with time constraints 
at the request of mcatv group president robert harris whose 
company owns universal television productions cownie organized a 
group of executives from the countrys 30 largest cable companies 
to talk with spielberg miami vice executive producer michael 
mann and other producers about a joint programming venture 
we havent given them specific ideas yet spielberg told usa 
today after the closeddoor meeting sunday but this was to let 
them know we would like to get in on the new frontier 
the convention also provided further evidence of broadcast 
companies interest in cable tv with the presence of fox 
broadcasting co and the national association of public tv 
stations both had booths on the convention floor 
fox is proposing ways cable and broadcast can work in 
cooperative promotional ventures and public tv stations have a 
vital interest in being carried by cable systems as more americans 
are added to cable systems 
more than half the nations approximately 90 million tv 
households subscribe to cable and more than 80 percent of 
households are wired for it 
speaking to financial analysts monday tcis malone said he was 
thrilled that hollywood producers are interested in the 
opportunities cable offers 
malone said producers are finding out that cable offers a new 
dimension for them to be creative to try things 
he said that while the cable industry doesnt have nearly the 
broadcast networks programming budgets more than 1 billion each 
cable can offer other things the networks cannot like editorial 
freedom 
i think youre going to see a lot of big stars willing to do 
work at lower cost because theyve got a message malone said 
and cable financed mostly by subscribers rather than 
advertising is better able than the broadcast networks to run 
programs that arent big ratings producers he said 
we have the staying power to deal with smaller audiences he 
said the networks cant afford to give up any share of the 
audience they reach because of the impact that has on ad revenues

democrats moved to erase the trade bills 
curbs on alaska oil exports tuesday even before the measure reached 
president reagans desk and a threatened presidential veto 
house speaker jim wright dtexas said the move was designed to 
offer reagan a compromise and thus perhaps avert a veto of the 
1000page bill which won final approval from the senate last week 
republicans countered that the real reason was to win over the 
votes of alaskas gop senators for a veto override 
the move to drop the alaska provision was contained in a 
resolution authorizing technical corrections in the bill 
the bill cleared the senate last week by a vote of 6336 last 
week three short of the number needed to override reagans 
threatened veto 
the house is expected to take up the resolution this week and 
senators will deal with it next week when they return from a recess 
one of the curbs would enable alaska to export 50000 barrels of 
crude a day to canada but would require that the oil be transported 
to a west coast port first in american vessels 
the provision is a favorite of politically influential maritime 
unions and a similar feature is contained in the current 
uscanada free trade agreement the other provision would limit 
exports from new refineries to 70000 barrels a day and half of 
total production 
at a news conference wright portrayed the move as designed to 
keep the trade bill from going down the drain through a reagan veto 
the president has been concerned about a provision that would 
require all but the smallest employers to give 60day notice of 
plant closings and largescale layoffs but more recently he has 
also reportedly found fault with the alaska provisions 
were trying to meet him reagan halfway if we can wright 
told reporters were trying in every way to appeal to his 
better nature 
before the plan won committee approval rep james h quillen 
rtenn described it as a ploy to change some votes in the 
senate in order to override a possible presidential veto 
i dont think this committee ought to be used for this 
purpose quillen said 
alaskas republican senators ted stevens and frank murkowski 
voted against the trade bill because of its resrictions on oil 
exports democrats believed that they would have supported the 
measure had the curbs been dropped 
stevens said at one point however that he could not guarantee 
support for the bill even if the alaska provisions were stripped 
out 
house minority leader robert h michel rill took the floor 
earlier and accused wright of trying to win at all costs 
i am told there is a proposed new rule in the works that will 
allow the majority to delete the alaskan oil provisions in a 
lastditch attempt to manipulate a veto override in the senate 
michel said 
is there nothing left of the integrity of our rules and 
procedures michel said good policy is the product of good 
legislation produced honestly and openly in a deliberative manner

panamanian officials have told opposition 
party leaders that military strongman manuel antonio noriega is 
considering stepping down as defense chief on aug 12 an 
opposition spokesman said tuesday 
guillermo cochez a spokesman for panamas christian democratic 
party also quoted president manuel solis palma as saying that an 
agreement on panamas political future may be signed this week 
cochez said the aug 12 departure date for noriega is under 
consideration because that is the fifth anniversary of his 
accession as commander of the panamanian defense forces 
reagan administration officials refused to discuss cochezs 
comments noting that a governmentwide news blackout on the 
panamanian issue has been imposed 
but panamas political future has been the subject of continuing 
negotiations between us officials and a variety of panamanians 
both in and out of government 
assistant secretary of state elliott abrams met tuesday with 
panamas ambassador juan b sosa a leader of the antinoriega 
forces in exile there was no report on the meeting 
cochez and aurelio barria a leader of another group opposed to 
noriega spoke to reporters at the national democratic institute 
for international affairs which is affiliated with the democratic 
party 
the administration in a policy shift said last week it is no 
longer insisting that noriega leave panama and would settle for his 
resignation as defense chief as a prelude to a transition to 
democratic rule 
word of the policy shift has angered the panamanian opposition 
which maintains that the countrys political future is for 
panamanians to decide not the united states 
the us has no right to decide if a panamanian can stay or 
not in the country barria said 
cochez said noriega would be able to maintain control in panama 
if he stays in the country even without a formal title 
any agreement allowing noriega to remain on would mean treason 
against the panamanian people he said 
we are completely convinced noriega is a murderer we are 
completely convinced he is involved in drugs cochez said 
noriega has been indicted by two federal grand juries in florida 
on drugsmuggling charges

ukrainian catholic leaders plea that he cancel the event as a sign 
of support for religious freedom 
he said he already made plans and he has to go myroslav 
cardinal lubachivsky told reporters after meeting privately with 
the president at the white house and declaring that ukrainian 
catholics continue to suffer persecution 
the cardinal added that the president promised to be firm 
about the issues of religious freedom in his discussions with 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
being there he will mention that freedom of the churches is 
necessary for all the people cardinal lubachivsky said 
he said reagan also pledged to try to meet with ukrainian 
catholic leaders while in the soviet union may 29 to june 2 
addressing a white house conference on religious rights in the 
soviet union just before his meeting with reagan the cardinal said 
that the age of suffering has not passed for christians in the 
soviet union 
today we hear so much about glasnost and perestroika he 
said but mr gorbachevs reforms have yet to touch the 
ukrainian catholic church our priests are punished or fined for 
celebrating the liturgy in private homes and the faithful live in 
constant fear of imprisonment such violations of basic human 
rights simply must not exist 
therefore in the name of all that is sacred i implore you 
to advise the president to reconsider his trip to the danilov 
monastery at this time he said the symbolism of this event 
would lend credence to the atheistic kremlins usurping of the 
1000yearold ukrainian christian legacy 
the monastery on the outskirts of moscow the central building 
of which is more than 700 years old is being restored with 
government financial help the building is noted for splendid 
religious decoration of gold and jewels 
the cardinal also said he urged the president to meet with 
ukrainian religious leaders of the underground church during his 
trip to moscow as a public manifestation of us support for the 
resurrection of our banned ukrainian churches 
reagan in his speech at the conference said i promise you 
that the witness of faith you brought here today will not be 
confined to these four walls or forgotten when this meeting is 
ended 
i will carry it in my heart when i travel to the soviet union 
at the end of this month and i will say that the most fitting way 
to mark the millenium of christianity in kiev would be granting 
the rights of all the peoples and all the creeds of the soviet 
union to worship their god in their own way 
while noting the 1000th anniversary of christianity in the 
soviet union reagan also said the rights of soviet jews have 
taken up much of our official time and this is very close to my 
heart our hope is for doors to open completely to emigration and 
to full freedom for all faiths

three engines on a united airlines jumbo jet 
lost power over the pacific ocean because three of the boeing 747s 
fuel tanks ran dry aviation sources said tuesday 
the huge jetliner with 258 passengers and crew aboard landed 
safely at the narita airport in japan on only one engine monday 
after its flight from los angeles no one was injured 
as the plane cruised at 39000 feet the pilot reported losing 
the first engine 1 hour and 15 minutes from the airport the second 
30 minutes later and the third just before landing at the airport 
40 miles northeast of tokyo 
united said in a statement that the three engines lost power 
but a spokesman for the airline declined to speculate on what 
caused the power loss because the investigation has yet to be 
completed 
the airplane has been thoroughly inspected we have not found 
a mechanical problem at this point the plane is airworthy 
united spokesman robert doughty said in chicago he said the 
aircraft was being flown from japan to uniteds maintenance 
facility at san francisco for further examination 
during the monday flight the pilot of the jumbo jet had told 
the airport control tower that he had shut two engines down because 
of a malfunction and asked for clearance for an expedited 
landing later another engine lost power 
but aviation sources familiar with the incident said tuesday 
that the power loss has been traced to three empty fuel tanks 
feeding the three engines it was not certain whether the tanks ran 
dry because of a mechanical problem or because of an error by the 
flight crew 
when the plane landed investigators found about 20000 pounds 
of fuel in the tank feeding the engine that was still operating 
said industry and government sources who spoke on condition they 
not be identified further 
the incident is being investigated by japanese authorities but 
us air safety investigators also are interested in the case 
drucella anderson a spokeswoman for the national transportation 
safety board said staffers plan to talk to crew members when they 
return to the united states 
in a boeing 747 which has a maximum fuel capacity of 320000 
pounds fuel is routinely transfered among its four wing tanks so 
that the plane maintains proper balance during a long transpacific 
flight aviation sources said 
according to the manufacturer the boeing 747100 of the type 
involved in the incident burns about 23500 pounds of fuel an hour 
each of the four engines is independent and has its own fuel 
lines drawing from the tanks in the wing said david jimenez a 
spokesman for the boeing co you can interchange fuel from tank 
to tank 
jimenez would not speculate how three of the four tanks aboard 
flight 97 would have run out of fuel while more than 20000 pounds 
of fuel remained in the fourth tank 
had that amount of fuel been evenly distributed the jumbo jet 
would have had no problems flying to its destination one aviation 
source suggested 
industry sources said it is possible that a fuel line or filter 
became clogged or a valve failed to open preventing the fuel from 
shifting properly another possibility is that the flight crew 
shifted too much fuel into the fourth tank and was unable to 
transfer it back to the other tanks 
normally the flight engineer in the threeperson cockpit has 
the responsibility of keep track of the fuel loads and transfering 
fuel from tank to tank as necessary to keep proper aircraft balance 
in newer boeing 747s the fuel transfer is conducted 
automatically by the aircrafts computerized flight system but in 
most older planes such as the 747100 series the shifting of fuel 
is conducted manually said elizabeth reese a boeing spokeswoman 
she said she did not know specifically whether the fuel transfer 
was manual or automatic aboard the united jet the aircraft has a 
variety of gauges to tell the flight crew how much fuel has been 
burned fuel remaining and the fuel flow rates for each tank she 
said

scientists have identified details of a 
key part of a gene responsible for male sexual development a step 
that could eventually help doctors treat prostate cancer and 
diagnose infertility in men 
the gene allows body cells to create surface structures called 
receptors to which male sex hormones attach themselves 
that binding triggers sexrelated functions in the cells said 
frank french head of the laboratories of reproductive biology at 
the university of north carolina at chapel hill 
its like a switch french said when the switch is turned 
on it causes genes to stimulate certain characteristic functions 
of the cell 
the work reported last month in the journal science was 
carried out by french and colleagues at the university 
the finding is a very major discovery its like getting the 
rest of the words to hamlet said donald coffey director of 
research at the brady urological institute at johns hopkins 
hospital in baltimore and chairman of the national cancer 
institutes prostate cancer program 
the north carolina researchers used the information to create 
special proteins called antibodies which detected the presence of 
the sex hormone receptors in laboratory animals 
a test based on these antibodies may one day help doctors choose 
proper therapy for prostate cancer french said 
the test called an androgen receptor assay would tell whether 
prostate cells still have the receptor on their surfaces the 
receptor disappears in advanced cases of prostate cancer french 
said 
once the receptor is gone hormone therapy to fight inoperable 
prostate cancer would be useless said coffey 
well know not to waste time with hormone therapy if its not 
going to work coffey said 
prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in 
men an estimated 96000 men get it each year in the united states 
and 27000 die from it according to the national cancer institute 
the receptor test also may ultimately prove helpful in 
determining the cause of infertility in some men french said 
without the receptor a man would appear female because his 
cells would not respond to male sex hormone french said however 
in some men the receptor is present but its binding ability is 
impaired resulting in normal development but infertility

a prominent writer said tuesday the soviets are 
still blaming the devastation of world war ii for their poor 
performance in agriculture and industry while japan and west 
germany have rebuilt and prospered 
chingiz aitmatov wrote in the government newspaper izvestia that 
the soviet union has fared worse than the vanquished nations in 
postwar economic recovery 
he said dictator josef stalin began the practice of ignoring the 
real causes of slow development and blaming it on the war 
more than 20 million soviet citizens died in the war and about 
onequarter of the housing and industry in the european part of the 
country was destroyed 
stalin launched a rebuilding campaign that replaced many 
factories wrecked in the war but housing remains a serious problem 
and farms still fail to produce enough food for the country 
sometimes it is necessary to compare how quickly and 
powerfully has been the economic rebirth of the capitulated nations 
west germany and japan which were brought to ruins thoroughly 
destroyed dismantled to the last nut aitmatov wrote 
he said soviet officials also remain reluctant to credit the 
united states and britain for their help in winning the war 
aitmatov specifically mentioned nearly 15000 warplanes provided to 
the soviet union 
aitmatov is a severe critic of totalitarianism and the 
dehumanizing influences of stalinism he condemned the 
collectivization of the 1930s that removed peasants from the land 
and noted that half a century later the government must buy grain 
abroad 
soviet planners should take a lesson from reforms carried out in 
china where no one is particularly sad about the failure of 
communes he said aitmatovs point seemed to be that more family 
farms would improve output 
embracing the reforms of soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev he 
said more democracy and openness were the only hope for a better 
future

soviet authorities are now processing 
emigration applications reasonably fast and jews who wish to 
leave should take advantage of the opportunity in case the 
situation changes a highranking us official said tuesday 
richard schifter assistant secretary of state for human rights 
and humanitarian affairs also said he saw some signs of growing 
religious toleration in the soviet union 
schifter in remarks to the national conference on soviet jewry 
said he believed a huge percentage of the soviet unions two 
million jews would emigrate if given the chance 
most have not applied knowing they would be subject to 
discrimination in employment and other opportunities during the 
long often unending period while waiting for approval 
schifter said however it looks as if a good many people 
could get their cases processed reasonably fast if they were to 
apply right now theyre afraid and theyre afraid quite rightfully 
because anything can turn in the soviet union with a very short 
time and they can find themselves in great difficulty after that 
a good many of them also are not fully aware today of what the 
possibilities are that you can indeed fill out the forms get them 
filed and theres a chance within six weeks or two months perhaps 
to get your application processed he said 
schifter said soviet jews should be assured that the 
possibilities are there now and they ought to take advantage of it 
if this is what they want to do 
after reaching a high point of 51320 exit permits in 1979 
soviet emigration declined to 914 in 1986 it rebounded to 8155 in 
1987 and will go even higher this year if the monthly figures hold 
up in march for example 986 jews emigrated the highest monthly 
total since 1981 according to the conference on soviet jewry 
the united states has been urging the soviets to allow freer 
emigration and religious freedom schifter said a pledge by 
gorbachev last week to show more tolerance toward religion 
represented somewhat of an opening 
he also said it appeared that for the past half year the soviets 
have not enforced laws prohibiting adult jewish education classes 
schifter expressed some optimism that the soviets will permit the 
importation of bibles 
schifter did not appear particularly concerned about gorbachevs 
condemnation during a visit by secretary of state george p shultz 
last month of the reagan administrations continued criticism of 
soviet human rights practices 
he gets annoyed about these things schifter said of 
gorbachev he is a person who has a short fuse on matters of this 
kind but the fact of the matter is that they are moving in this 
area 
president reagan is expected to continue raising the issues when 
he goes to moscow for the may 29june 2 summit 
shultz told the soviet jewry conference that during his visit to 
moscow in april he raised several human rights concerns but 
concentrated on jewish emigration he said the united states is 
seeking improvements on five aspects of the issue 
processing time there are too many bureaucratic delays 
shultz said of the application process while they cant admit it 
they soviet leaders see it as a real problem 
applications denied for security reasons many jews 
applications are rejected on grounds they hold state secrets even 
those who havent worked in defense plants for decades theres 
been no movement from the soviets on this but at least the 
problem is up there on the table shultz said 
family restrictions the soviets deny applications to those who 
do not have close relatives in the west a practice that violates 
human rights accords the soviets have signed shultz said 
ill applicants the soviets should loosen up on applications 
from people seeking medical care elsewhere the secretary said 
parental veto under soviet law the parents of an applicant 
can veto the granting of a permit even if the child is an adult 
theyre looking into it shultz said

east german jews on tuesday accused their 
departing american rabbi of high living and improper performance of 
duties and said they were looking for another man to become the 
communist nations only rabbi 
one local jew who spoke on condition of anonymity said some 
community members had begun calling isaac neuman the hollywood 
rabbi 
numerous telephone calls to neumans home were unanswered 
tuesday however neuman said on sunday that such issues as his 
apartment and car were not part of the tensions that prompted him 
to decide to leave 
a statement from the east berlin jewish community carried by 
the official adn news agency responded to criticisms made by 
neuman when he announced last weekend he was leaving may 16 after 
only eight months 
the 65yearold rabbi from champaign ill had complained of 
what he called antisemitism in east germany and interference in 
his work from local jewish leadership 
tuesdays statement from local jewish leaders said his 
current assertion that antisemitic tendencies in the press 
have caused his return were never raised in his discussions with 
the community 
east germany officially maintains it has wiped out antisemitism 
in its nearly four decades of existence 
the statement also charged neuman with improperly carrying out 
some of his duties such as dealing with the elderly and preparing 
youths for bar mitzvah 
the polishborn neuman a nazi prisoner during world war ii in 
september became the first rabbi in 21 years for this nations 
jewish community of about 450 people 
there was no official word on a replacement for neuman 
community members who spoke on condition of anonymity said 
neuman would be succeeded by chicago rabbi ernst m lorge others 
sources close to the community said lorge would be appointed only 
on an interim basis while a young rabbi was sought as a permanent 
replacement 
lorge 71 said tuesday in chicago he had received no official 
invitation to come to east germany if i do i would have to 
think about it he said 
he said he did not want to stay in east germay yearround but 
might accept a shortterm arrangement 
lorge was born in mainz germany and emigrated to the united 
states fleeing nazi persecution in 1936 
neuman explaining his reasons for leaving in an interview 
tuesday said i am unhappy about east germany and 
antisemitism 
he criticized the east german news medias depiction of 
palestinian unrest in israel 
sometimes the way israel is depicted is in a nazilike 
fashion he said they have cut antisemitism but have not 
succeeded in uprooting it 
he also complained about interference in his work his main 
objections focused on the local jewish community president peter 
kirchner who signed the statement distributed tuesday by the east 
german news agency 
the assertion that rabbi neuman was hindered in carrying out 
his functions by members or the community representatives or 
other people must be rejected with emphasis the statement said 
east berlin jewish community members who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said there had long been criticism of neuman and his 
lifestyle 
he would drive to west berlin every day to get fresh 
tomatoes said one local jew 
community members said neuman was provided with a large 
apartment and a car during his tenure 
the community supported neuman with funds provided by the 
government 
the east german jewish community includes less than 350 
officially registered members and about 100 other worshipers 
neuman said however some estimates say that there are as many as 
2500 nonpracticing jews in east germany

a congressional critic of nuclear power urged 
the nuclear regulatory commission on tuesday to reject a staff 
proposal that would permit atomic reactors to operate at low power 
without an alarm system to warn nearby residents in case of an 
emergency 
the recommendation scheduled for a preliminary commission vote 
shortly is aimed at the seabrook nh plant the atomic safety 
and licensing appeal board has blocked a lowpower license for 
seabrook because of the lack of a warning system for neighboring 
communities in nearby massachusetts 
during fuel loading and lowpower operation the potential for 
an accident still exists including the possibility of a reactor 
reaching a critical level rep edward j markey dmass said 
in a letter to nrc chairman lando w zech jr 
while the magnitude of the risk may be lower than at full 
power it is no lower than it was in 1982 when the nrc examined 
the issue in detail and adopted existing standards markey wrote 
critics say seabrook officials want to quickly secure a 
lowpower license because they fear they will lose their chance to 
operate the 54 billion plant if massachusetts gov michael s 
dukakis is elected president 
dukakis has led the fight against seabrook and his refusal to 
cooperate in emergency evacuation planning for the six bay state 
municipalities has delayed the licensing process 
its clear that theyre trying to push this through because 
they dont know what the future holds for the nrc said markey 
aide cathy hurwit 
nrc spokesman robert newlin said the commission was expected to 
vote soon on whether to make the recommendation a proposed 
rule that would be subject to a public comment period but not 
necessarily a hearing and a final commission vote newlin said 
nrc officials say the current rules do not specifically require 
an offsite warning system to obtain a lowpower license and that 
the rules change would only clarify the regulations 
but a 1982 commission explanation of the rule does specify 
an offsite system and that clearly has been the interpretation of 
the licensing appeals board 
the board ruled in february that a lowpower license for 
seabrook is precluded unless and until the applicants have 
submitted substitute public notification plans for the 
massachusetts communities within the emergency zone 
seabrook has proposed an alternate alert system that would use 
truckmounted sirens backed up by sirenequipped helicopters 
according to plant spokesman rob williams 
williams said seabrook officials plan to use that system during 
lowpower operation but with the rules change would not need to 
wait for regulatory approval of the system approval would be 
needed eventually for a fullpower license

a widow whose husband smoked and died of 
lung cancer can pursue a wrongful death lawsuit against a tobacco 
company and a retailer that sold cigarettes the minnesota court of 
appeals ruled tuesday 
a threejudge panel unanimously overturned a district court 
ruling in may 1987 that ann forsters claim was preempted by the 
federal cigarette and advertising act 
in march 1985 mrs forster and her husband john sued rj 
reynolds co manufacturers of camel cigarettes and erickson 
petroleum corp owner of holiday station stores the forsters 
claimed the retailer sold forster the cigarettes 
forster who was diagnosed as having inoperable lung cancer in 
november 1984 died of the disease in june 1985 and the suit 
originally filed as a product liability case was amended to a 
wrongful death action the lawsuit alleges that cigarettes caused 
the lung cancer 
judge thomas kalitowski who wrote the majority opinion said 
the us supreme court historically has taken a narrow view of 
federal preemption 
in overturning the lower court kalitowski said our holding 
is founded on the strong presumption basic to our system of 
federalism that state police powers are not superseded by federal 
actions without clear and unmistakable congressional intent or 
absolute necessity 
we recognize appellants claims may be difficult to prove 
the ruling said however the difficulty of proof should not 
preclude the basic right to present claims

the house on tuesday urged president reagan to 
maintain at least 20 missilefiring submarines as part of any 
ussoviet agreement to cut back strategic nuclear weapons 
the voicevote decision came as the chamber adopted an amendment 
to a bill authorizing the pentagon budget for the fiscal year 
starting oct 1 
both nations are now negotiating to achieve a strategic arms 
reduction talks start treaty that could provide reductions of up 
to 50 percent in each countrys stockpile of longrange atomic 
weapons 
those stockpiles are made up of submarinelaunched missiles 
landbased missiles and bombers under the proposed treaty both 
sides would be required to reduce and restructure their arsenals 
the united states now has more than half its strategic firepower 
aboard 36 missilefiring subs including 28 poseidonclass boats 
and eight of the giant tridentclass subs seven more tridents are 
under construction while a 16th is authorized in the bill now on 
the house floor 
the united states hasnt yet decided how to restack its 
stockpile under a start treaty but the amendment offered by rep 
stephen solarz dny said at least 20 submarines should be 
retained 
our ability to prevent nuclear war depends more than anything 
else on the maintenance of a survivable nuclear deterrent said 
solarz who added that subs are virtually invulnerable to attack 
while they are at sea 
it is in our interest to have the maximum number of submarines 
possible solarz said 
as it worked through the bill the chamber also gave voice vote 
approval to an amendment banning the sending of any coast guard 
vessels to help the navy patrol the persian gulf 
supporters of the amendment had said a day earlier they planned 
to drop the proposal in the wake of a pentagon announcement that 
the deployment plan was being shelved but as the issue arose 
tuesday a procedural snare meant it was easier to simply approve 
the amendment than to bypass it 
in another decision the house voted 213195 to give federal 
contractors more freedom to set pay scales 
the vote approved an amendment overhauling the davisbacon act 
the 1931 law which requires that employees covered by contracts on 
federal jobs worth more than 2000 should be paid the prevailing 
local wage rate a figure determined by the labor department the 
rate is commonly the same rate paid union workers 
the measure approved tuesday would raise the threshold figure 
from 2000 to 50000 
the vote came shortly before the chamber rejected 210204 a 
move that would have raised the davisbacon threshold from 2000 
to 250000 
the davisbacon law was enacted during the great depression amid 
worries that construction companies would hire cheap labor 
tuesdays votes on the bill went generally along party lines 
with democrats backing the 50000 threshold and republicans 
supporting the 250000 threshold 
there have been a number of attempts during the reagan 
administration to change the law by critics who contend that the 
2000 figure is outdated organized labor has strongly supported 
the davisbacon law 
the amendment approved tuesday was essentially the same measure 
passed last aug 4 by the house education and labor committee that 
bill hasnt yet come to the floor but committee leaders said they 
offered it as an amendment to the pentagon budget bill in an effort 
to forestall the amendment proposing a 250000 threshold 
neither the start nor the davisbacon amendments adopted tuesday 
is part of the pentagon budget bill which the senate will be 
considering next week 
differences between the measures that eventually pass each

scientists expressed dismay tuesday that some 
white house decisions might have been based on astrology with one 
saying thats not the type of guidance we need from the federal 
government 
andrew fraknoi an astronomy professor at san francisco state 
university and executive officer of the astronomical society of the 
pacific said that the claims of astrology have been subjected to 
dozens of scientific tests and have been found totally without 
foundation 
in one test he said two scientists examined more than 3000 
predictions by astrologers and found that they were correct less 
than 10 percent of the time 
if the predictions are wrong 90 percent of the time thats 
not the type of guidance we need from the federal government 
fraknoi said in a telephone interview from his san francisco office 
meanwhile an organization of scientists called the committee 
for the scientific investigation of the claims of the paranormal 
said in a statement 
we are dismayed by reports that the white house has consulted 
astrologists we are concerned by the apparent return to medieval 
superstitition dozens of tests in recent years by scientists can 
find little if any evidence for astrological claims horoscopes 
have been shown under the most rigorous scientific analysis to fail 
completely in predicting future events 
the committee also asked the white house to confirm to what 
extent astrologers have been advisers of presidents the public has 
the right to know who these astrologers are and what 
recommendations they have made we ask that their claims and 
alleged authorities be subjected to scientific scrutiny 
the issue was raised by reports that former white house chief of 
staff donald t regan wrote in an upcoming book that nancy reagan 
consulted astrologers to determine the timing of presidential 
speeches and announcements 
president reagan said tuesday that he has never based any policy 
or decision on astrological forecasts but the white house 
acknowledged that mrs reagan has consulted an astrologer to help 
schedule the presidents activities 
fraknoi said modern astrology uses the positions of the uranus 
and neptune in making predictions and yet these planets were not 
even discovered when the concept of astrology was established in 
ancient times 
furthermore he said the astrological predictions presumably 
are based on the alignment of planets against a background of the 
stars yet since the astrology system was established in ancient 
times the earths position has shifted slightly so that the 
constellations no longer are in the same relative viewing position 
in effect the signs of the zodiac viewed now are not those seen by 
the ancients he said 
franknoi said the concepts of astrology are based on the idea 
that the influence of the stars and planets have some effect on 
infants as they are born hence the gravitational and tidal effect 
of mars for instance are supposed to influence the life of a 
child he said 
but calculations by scientists show that the obstetrican who 
delivers a baby has a six times greater gravitational influence on 
a child than the planet mars fraknoi said and the tidal effect of 
the obstetrican is greater by a factor of 2 trillion 
scientists have been warning for years that the uncritical 
prominence given to astrology may have a deleterious effect on the 
public said the statement from the committee for the scientific 
investigation of the claims of the paranormal the intrusion 
of astrology into the highest levels of national security thinking 
now is a cause for further concern 
if the united states is to continue its leadership in 
scientific research it is vital that the public have a clear 
understanding of the difference between science and pseudoscience 
and that decisions be based on the real world without resorting to 
mystical fortune telling and other primitive forms of 
prognostication the statement said 
the organization has hundreds of scientists as members 
including such familiar names as carl sagan and isaac asimov

rep roy dyson dmd scheduled a news 
conference in his district wednesday after remaining in seclusion 
following the death of his top aide last weekend in a plunge from 
the 24th floor of a new york city hotel 
the session with reporters was announced tuesday by katie 
tucker who also told reporters that she has been elevated from 
press secretary to chief of staff 
mstucker will replace tom pappas who police said apparently 
jumped to his death sunday from his room in the helmsley palace 
hotel after leaving a note 
congressman roy dyson will introduce ms tucker to the people 
of the first district on wednesday may 4 at 2 pm at the southern 
maryland electric cooperative in hughesville md said ms 
tuckers statement 
ms tucker returned to dysons office as press secretary just a 
week ago she had worked there as press secretary and legislative 
assistant in 1985 
while dyson did not attend a session of the house of 
representatives on tuesday the house approved an amendment offered 
by him to the defense authorization bill the amendment would 
require the secretary of the navy to establish a tethered 
aerostat radar surveillance system near the patuxent naval air 
station that could be used by the defense and treasury departments 
in drug surveillance operations 
dyson also missed a meeting of the house merchant marine and 
fisheries committee but voted by proxy on amendments to a bill 
that would open up the arctic national wildlife refuge to oil 
drillers a check of the proxy by the associated press showed that 
it was signed by dyson last week 
pappas was dysons closest aide and top adviser from the time 
dyson was elected to the state legislature in 1974 his death came 
the same day the washington post published an article quoting 
former aides as saying that pappas pressured male staffers to 
socialize with him 
the staffers said the pressure did not go beyond demands that 
they attend parties and social functions with pappas 
there also have been numerous articles recently concerning 
payments made from dysons campaign funds to a media relations 
company owned by pappas payments to pappenbauer associates totaled 
119642 since 1980 a revised dyson campaign report showed 
democratic leaders in the congressional district say they dont 
believe dysons prospects for being reelected to a fifth term in 
november will be jeopardized by publicity surrounding the death of 
pappas and the campaign payments to him 
they say however that the extent of the damage will depend on 
how dyson confronts his problems 
there are a lot of folks who need some direction i think he 
needs to make a statement state delegate daniel long a dyson 
supporter said tuesday 
long said however he doesnt blame dyson for going into 
seclusion 
he has lost his friend his mentor his campaign manager his 
top aide he said

a man convicted of murdering seven women and 
letting their bodies rot faces life in prison rather than death 
under an unusual sentence handed down tuesday 
common pleas judge robert a latrone issued six death sentences 
against harrison marty graham but ordered him first to serve up 
to 14 years in prison on seven counts of abuse of a corpse and life 
in prison for the remaining murder 
latrone who ordered the sentences to run consecutively 
explained that he chose life in prison over the death penalty on 
the first murder count because of a mitigating circumstance the 
lack of a previous record but the conviction on the first count 
legally qualified as an aggravating circumstance on the second 
through seventh murder counts necessitating the death penalty in 
those six cases 
graham could not apply for parole during the life sentence 
however without putting the death sentence into effect defense 
attorney joel moldovsky said 
graham whose attorney said he was mentally retarded sat 
motionlessly through the sentencing a halfsmoked cigarette tucked 
behind his ear 
moldovsky called the sentence unusually compassionate and 
brilliant 
but assistant district attorney roger king who characterized 
graham as a serial killer during the trial questioned the 
legality of the order 
it would appear that the greater sentence would come first 
he said meaning the death penalty 
the pennsylvania supreme court reviews all death sentences 
last week latrone convicted graham of seven counts of murder 
and abuse of a corpse graham waived his right to a jury trial 
leaving the decisions including sentencing solely to the judge 
police found the bodies of seven women in august 1987 after 
graham was evicted from his apartment because of a putrid stench 
officers found six rotting bodies in grahams bedroom leg and foot 
bones outside his apartment and a torso in a neighboring houses 
basement 
at his mothers urging graham surrendered to police a week 
after the bodies were discovered 
in a statement his lawyer unsuccessfully contested graham told 
police he strangled the women while having sex and after feeding 
them drugs and alcohol he said that when the bodies began piling 
up in his apartment he began experiencing trouble with furball 
bugs or maggots and with birds feeding on the remains outside 
the window 
the 28yearold graham did not testify during the sixweek trial 
moldovsky who had argued his client did not know right from 
wrong and might have killed the women accidentally or because of 
drug or alcohol use said he would consult with grahams family 
before deciding whether to appeal

vice president george bush told a victory 
rally on tuesday his clinching of the republican presidential 
nomination was just a first step while his son told campaign 
workers to go out and kick some mike dukakis 
bush celebrated his mathematical lock on the nomination at an 
over the top party at a washington hotel 
the vice president said surpassing the 1139 delegates needed 
for nomination which he actually did in last weeks pennsylvania 
primary wrapped this thing up sooner than i think any of us 
thought might take place 
bush was was expected to pick up another 132 delegates in 
tuesdays winnertakeall gop primaries in ohio indiana and the 
district of columbia 
it all boiled down to working together bush told his 
campaign staff and volunteer workers 
and yet he added i dont feel any finality to what has 
happened now at all weve passed the first step a tremendously 
important step but now weve got a long way to go 
george bush jr sharing the platform with his father told the 
group our dad needs a real job 
sometimes sons can say things a father cant we want you to 
go out there and kick some mike dukakis and kick him hard he 
said 
the younger bushs remarks about the democratic frontrunner 
were a play on bushs celebrated offcolor gloat to new jersey 
longshoremen in which he characterized his performance in his 1984 
debate with democratic vice presidential candidate geraldine 
ferraro 
the vice president declared to rousing cheers that the party 
is united 
i dont believe there are any deep divisions in this party at 
all he said let mike dukakis go around here talking about 
pink slips despair pessimism in the united states ill be the 
guy out there talking about hope and opportunity and challenge 
republican party chairman frank fahrenkopf told the gathering 
tonight we officially celebrate the fact that george bush will be 
our nominee following the convention in new orleans 
although bush campaign aides earlier had said there was a 
possibility that president reagan would attend the rally to 
formally voice his endorsement of bush the president was not in 
attendance 
it never really jelled said bush spokesman peter teeley 
however campaign and white house aides suggested that it was 
likely reagans endorsement would come soon perhaps within the 
week 
campaigning earlier in morgantown wva bush said that 
americans have gotten a little fat dumb and happy about the 
nations energy needs and growing dependence on foreign oil 
at west virginia university bush watched university scientists 
display a model of a circulating fluidized bed that eases the 
mining process by converting minerals to liquids 
in his speech after leaving the research facility he quipped 
at one point some guy was going into all this fluoride bed thing 
and the doctor said do you understand that and i said hell 
no the last thing i understood was when the guy said hello but 
it was impressive 
earlier he said the acid rain problem that canadian prime 
minister brian mulroney recently discussed with president reagan 
made it even more urgent to find clean ways to burn coal 
theres no way you can make an energy model for the future 
without coal as a very important part he said 
bush called his trip to west virginia which has its primary 
next tuesday a relatively nonpolitical visit and avoided 
partisan remarks in his speech 
asked by reporters about barbs he has traded with dukakis bush 
said i found myself going back at him a little more than i 
wanted to 
on picking a vice president bush said he wanted someone loyal 
whom he could trust 
when a reporter said that sounded like bush himself he replied 
thats just fine with me and he ought to be prepared to take a 
helluva lot of flak for handling it that way

an estimated 200 rebel indians backed 
by the united states surrendered their weapons and agreed to join 
the sandinistas the government newspaper el nuevo diario said 
tuesday 
it said the indians agreed to stop military actions against the 
sandinistas and to not allow the presence of guerrilla groups in 
the territory 
the indians like other contra groups operating from honduras 
and costa rica had us backing and fought the leftist sandinista 
government since 1981 
tens of thousands of miskito rama and sumo indians left their 
tribal homelands beginning in 1981 after the government tried to 
impose marxism in the area and said it would move them to 
relocation camps 
many indians crossed the rio coco and sought refuge in honduras 
rather than move to relocation camps thousands took up arms 
creating rebel movements which like the larger nicaraguan 
resistance received us aid 
most of the refugees have returned to their native 75milelong 
region along the atlantic seaboard the region is considered a 
national security area and foreigners are barred unless they have 
interior ministry permission 
the sandinistas some years ago acknowledged their errors with 
the indians and sought their support 
by march 1 nearly 7000 had returned from honduran refugee 
camps according to the un high commissioner for refugees 
the government has not been as successful with other contra 
groups a fragile interim truce has been in place since april 1 as 
contras and sadinista leaders negotiate a permanent peace accord

the city elections board voted unanimously 
tuesday to hold a special mayoral election in spring 1989 to choose 
a successor to the late mayor harold washington whose term would 
have ended in 1991 
were proceeding with the 1989 election unless were ordered 
to the contrary by the court said tom leach a spokesman for the 
city board of elections commissioners 
the board had voted april 24 to hold a special mayoral election 
in april 1989 if city clerk walter kozubowski declared that 
washingtons death in late november created a vacancy in the 
position 
kozubowski said at the time he wouldnt issue such a declaration 
unless ordered to do so by a court but on monday he apparently 
changed his mind and provided the elections board with the 
documentation leach said 
the board decided to accept the declaration of a vacancy from 
the city clerk and decided to go ahead with the 1989 election 
unless were ordered not to by the courts leach said 
circuit judge eugene wachowski said last week he expected to 
rule on the issue at a hearing friday 
supporters of acting mayor eugene sawyer and alderman tim evans 
a rival and potential mayoral candidate have been feuding over 
when the next mayoral election should be held 
evans hailed tuesdays decision as a great victory for all of 
chicago 
we have never doubted that 1989 is the legally correct time 
for a special election he said in a statement issued from 
atlanta where he is attending a meeting of city finance officers 
now however belatedly the board of elections has heard the 
voices of the people and has followed the dictates of law it is a 
great victory for all of chicago one that is certain to be upheld 
by the courts evans said 
sawyers press secretary monroe anderson did not return a 
telephone call seeking comment 
under the plan approved tuesday leach said a primary election 
would be held feb 28 followed by a general election april 4 
1989 that also would be used to choose a 6th ward alderman to 
succeed acting mayor eugene sawyer 
sawyer was elected washingtons successor by the city council 
shortly after the citys first black mayor died of a heart attack 
in late november 
both sides filed lawsuits asking the cook county circuit court 
to decide the issue evans forces have sought a 1989 special 
election while sawyers allies have been fighting for the 1991 
election 
naturally its going to be fought out in the court leach 
said tuesday 
he said the elections board would not contest any court decision 
dictating when the next mayoral election should be held 
we take a neutral position we dont fight anything leach 
said

us attorney general edwin meese iii said tuesday 
that police worldwide need to cooperate more closely because 
terrorism organized crime and drug trafficking have reached 
international dimensions 
it is not unusual for a person to commit a crime and be half a 
world away in the next few hours meese told the fifth annual 
meeting of the international association of police chiefs 
he predicted that many local police cars in the united states 
would be equipped with minicomputers with access to international 
computers 
meese cited possible links between a fatal bombing outside a 
us military club in naples italy and the arrest of a japanese 
man carrying pipe bombs on the new jersey turnpike 
he said us investigators determined that the man yu kikumura 
was a known member of the japanese red army a terrorist group 
whose members were blamed for detonating a car bomb on april 14 
outside the naples uso club 
meese said such incidents require the highest level in the 
sharing of intelligence between governments 
italian officials issued arrest warrants for two fugitive 
members of the japanese red army in the naples bombing the attack 
killed four italians and an american servicewoman 
meese also told the law enforcenment officials from 60 countries 
that crime in the united states is climbing and that the spread and 
sale of drugs seems to be getting worse instead of better 
recalling his trip last month to latin america meese said he 
flew over a coca field 75 miles wide and 200 miles long proving 
the pervasive spread of cocaine production in the area 
he said drug production now has a potential for undermining 
governments 
before the opening of the threeday meeting in rome meese met 
with justice minister giuliano vassali to discuss improving 
extradition procedures between italy and the united states and to 
organize joint education programs for police and other law 
enforcement agencies 
meese said he granted an italian request to consider 
transferring an italian convicted of subversion silvia baraldini 
now in a high security prison in lexington ky to another 
facility currently under construction 
members of parliament have asked that her prison conditions be 
improved

toyota announced tuesday that owners of about 
380000 camrys are entitled to have a brake pedal pulsation problem 
repaired free 
the voluntary recall which is available to owners of 19831986 
camrys and certain early 1987 camrys is designed to correct a 
brake pedal pulsation problem that some owners have complained 
about said debra sanchez a spokeswoman for toyota motor sales 
usa inc in torrance calif 
brake pedal pulsation can be felt by drivers when their foot is 
on the pedal but it does not affect braking effectiveness or 
steering control sanchez said brake pedal pulsation is caused by 
movement of the brake pads as they pass over the brake disc she 
said 
later this month toyota plans to notify owners of the cars in 
phases based on model years the problem will be fixed at no charge 
to the customer for a period of 12 months from the date of 
notification the company said 
the action comes in the wake of a classaction lawsuit filed in 
california state court by two public interest law firms seeking 
free repairs and reimbursement for car owners who have paid to have 
their camrys fixed or checked 
were impressed with this step theyre taking theres no 
question its a major commitment john phillips of the center for 
law in the public interest said of toyotas announcement 
attorneys will pursue the suit however because weve 
alleged that theyve engaged in a secret warranty for this defect 
by notifying the dealers and not notifying the owners phillips 
said 
the center for auto safety in washington dc joined in the 
suit filed april 20 in los angeles county superior court

afghan and soviet forces routinely killed and 
tortured civilian refugees fleeing to pakistan from the war in 
afghanistan a human rights group charged tuesday 
amnesty international in a report called afghanistan 
unlawful killings and torture also said civilians were killed or 
tortured in reprisals for the actions of afghan rebels fighting the 
sovietbacked government in kabul 
amnesty international said its main concern was the alleged 
killing of clearly helpless civilians particularly refugees 
it cited one instance in which 100 families were attacked twice 
on their 300mile trek out of the country killed were 24 refugees 
including seven children under the age of six it said 
amnesty international has compiled evidence of what appears to 
be a policy of deliberate killings by soviet and afghan government 
forces of afghan refugees found traveling toward pakistan said 
the report 
the londonbased rights group said soliders have attacked 
buses and groups of women children and men moving on foot and on 
horseback many of whom were fleeing soviet and afghan bombing 
and shelling of their villages in retaliation for guerrilla attacks 
amnesty international said its representatives visited refugees 
in pakistan and india and obtained information from witnesses to 
the attacks 
the ninepage report dealt with 1987 and early 1988 
the human rights group said the afghan government should make 
every effort to investigate the allegations during the withdrawal 
of soviet forces from afghanistan scheduled to begin this month 
the soviets have been in the country since 1979 supporting the 
government 
we are worried that during this interim period if firm 
measures are not taken by the kabul government there could be 
further human rights violations especially killings and torture 
said jawid laiq of amnesty 
there appears to be a policy to attack refugees he said 
we feel that this has occurred fairly often although we cant put 
a number on it 
about 3 million afghan refugees have fled across the border to 
pakistan where the moslem guerrillas fighting the kabul government 
have bases 
united nations officials have estimated that 22 million other 
afghan refugees live in iran 
under an accord signed last month the soviet army is to begin a 
ninemonth withdrawal of its 115000 troops in afghanistan the 
guerrillas say they will ignore the agreement and fight on 
amnesty international also cited reports of the summary 
executions of civilians who remained in their homes during the war 
and the torture of others taken into custody 
the report said however information suggests that torture 
may not be as systematic and as routine a form of interrogation as 
it was till early 1986

sandinista police detained five hunger 
strike sympathizers on tuesday when they tried to talk to reporters 
in the area where workers were on the ninth day of a fast to demand 
higher pay 
the officers members of the interior ministrys special forces 
unit cited a ban on unauthorized public activities 
police have taken at least 40 people into custody during the 
past week in connection with the hunger strike by more than 30 
construction workers and car mechanics 
sandinista policewomen wearing black berets and toting rubber 
truncheons cordoned off the front of the headquarters of the 
general workers federation a coalition of socialist 
antigovernment unions and kept journalists away 
the five sympathizers stood around the corner from the union 
hall and told reporters that authorities would not let them get 
close to the union building where some hunger strikers peered 
through locked gates 
police pushed through the journalists grabbed the five and 
shoved them into three different vehicles 
this is an unauthorized public act said a sandinista police 
officer who refused to give his name 
police last friday night permitted a group of sandinsta students 
to hold a rally at the same spot where the arrests were made 
interior minister tomas borge last week reportedly punched in 
the mouth the director of an antigovernment radio station for 
broadcasting what borge said was wrong information about the 
strike the sandinista newspaper barricada reported the altercation 
about 1500 construction workers and auto mechanics have been on 
strike since the end of february for higher salaries and improved 
working conditions 
the wildcat strikes are an embarrassment to the leftist 
sandinista government 
such strikes were illegal for almost six years under a state of 
emergency that was lifted in january 
president daniel ortega removed the restrictions as part of a 
regional peace plan which includes calls for democratic reforms 
ortega and the presidents of honduras guatemala el salvador and 
costa rica signed the agreement last august 
public demonstrations are allowed only with interior ministry 
permission 
the staterun telephone company meanwhile cut off service to 
about 6000 offices and homes in managua because of overdue bills 
totaling 18 million 
the cutoff left the national banking system embassies 
staterun enterprises government offices and thousands of homes in 
the capital without telephone service there are a total of 29000 
phones in managua a city of about 900000 people 
hundreds of nicaraguans went to the nicaraguan 
telecommunications and postal institute protesting the shutoff and 
saying they had paid their bills 
a telephone company spokeswoman maritza flores acknowledged 
that some phones were disconnected because of computer 
problems but said other customers had not paid their bills for 
several months

ohio sen howard metzenbaum one of the most liberal members of 
congress easily won the democratic nomination for a third term 
tuesday paving the way for a bigmoney battle against clevelands 
republican mayor george voinovich 
in two other state primaries indiana secretary of state evan 
bayh and north carolina lt gov bob jordan captured democratic 
nominations for governor and will seek to reclaim their states top 
post from republicans 
with 26 percent of the ohio vote counted metzenbaum had 261416 
votes or 823 percent and his lone opponent ralph applegate who 
runs a columbus lawncare business had 56359 votes or 177 
percent 
in indiana with 35 percent of precincts reporting bayh had 
156731 votes or 823 percent former kokomo mayor stephen j daily 
had 22183 votes or 116 percent and senate minority leader frank 
l obannon had 11499 votes or 60 percent 
lt gov john m mutz 52 was unopposed for the republican 
nomination 
bayh 32yearold son of former sen birch e bayh was aided by 
one of the most famous names in indiana politics in his bid to end 
20 years of republican rule gov robert d orr was barred by state 
law from seeking a third term 
obannon is bayhs choice for lieutenant governor but he put 
his name on the ballot as a precaution when it appeared bayh might 
be ruled ineligible because of a fiveyear residency requirement 
but the state supreme court ruled last week that bayh met the 
qualifications 
this campaign begins tonight and it will be as important as 
any in the history of indiana said bayh in claiming victory 
indiana also has a senate race this year but neither republican 
sen richard g lugar nor democratic attorney jack wickes had 
primary challenges 
in north carolina with 21 percent of the vote in jordan had 
70197 votes or 80 percent next came billy martin a 
servicestation employee not related to governor with 9751 votes 
or 11 percent then carroll w crawford of mount ulla a former ku 
klux klansman with 3921 votes or 4 percent james t lloyd of 
salisbury with 1786 votes or 2 percent and bruce friedman an 
antinuclear activist from sylva with 1765 votes or 2 percent 
jordan called the viictory the highest honor and the best 
opportunity the north carolina people have ever given me and 
predicted his campaign against gop gov jim martin would be a 
classic race 
martin only the second republican this century to hold the 
office had no primary opposition as he sought a second term 
metzenbaum 70 has consistently drawn top ratings from the 
liberal americans for democratic action based on his voting record 
and as a member of the senate judiciary committee he helped lead 
the fight against the supreme court nomination of robert bork 
voinovich 51 who was unopposed for the gop nomination is a 
moderate who recently came out in support of the trade bill which 
president reagan pledges to veto 
voinovich used the occasion to formally open his central ohio 
headquarters in the state capital and predicted a hardhitting 
cliffhanger race in november against metzenbaum 
you mark my words the most focusedon race in the united 
states is going to be metzenbaumvoinovich this will be a 
barnburner voinovich said in columbus 
metzenbaum who spent the night in cleveland issued a statement 
saying he was honored that democrats had given him an overwhelming 
vote of confidence 
and as ive said before he added when the votes are 
counted in november im confident that 1988 will be a very 
disappointing year for republican candidates named george 
ohio also had two lively congressional races a gop primary in 
the northwestern 5th district matched ohio senate president paul 
gillmor against robert latta son of rep delbert latta who is 
retiring after 30 years in washington a third republican rex 
damschroder was also in the race while thomas murray ran 
unopposed for the districts democratic nomination 
in the cleveland areas 20th district sixterm rep mary rose 
oakar faced a democratic primary challenge from former cleveland 
mayor dennis kucinich michael sajna a republican writein 
candidate was unopposed for the gop nod 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
even before the primary voinovich and metzenbaum squared off by 
spending thousands on television ads questioning each others 
commitments to social security retirement benefits and challenging 
disclosure of personal financial information 
federal election commission reports showed that as of march 31 
metzenbaum had raised 44 million the thirdhighest amount of any 
incumbent senator seeking reelection this year 
voinovich who raised 29 million by the same date had 
initially criticized his rival for collecting money out of state 
but he recently announced a fundraising drive of his own in major 
cities around the country 
in indiana mutz a 20year veteran of the general assembly and 
executive branch sought to make an issue of bayhs youth and 
experience saying were not talking about electing somebody 
class president here 
bayh responded that age was not relevant and said the 
governorship was not just some kind of gold watch that someone is 
awarded after 20 years of service 
a poll published sunday by the fort wayne journalgazette showed 
bayh with a 45 percent to 32 percent advantage over mutz 
the democrats are on the losing side of current polls in north 
carolina where the greensboro news amp record reported that a recent 
survey showed jordan trailing martin 47 percent to 39 percent with 
14 percent undecided 
jordan has attacked martin as trying to take credit for 
democrats accomplishments martin claims that in his first three 
years more than 300000 new jobs have come into the state from 
poultry to high tech 
jordan drew criticism in march when he told black newspaper 
executives he agreed with them on some issues that he wouldnt 
discuss publicly because he could not win without the white 
redneck vote in eastern north carolina 
jordan said he hadnt meant to be derogatory and considered 
himself a redneck

american m16 rifles made in korea have been 
sold illegally by a korean manufacturer to at least one nation and 
maybe more a house investigations subcommittee charged tuesday 
the united states and korea signed an agreement in 1971 allowing 
m16s to be manufactured in korea but the pact prohibited sales to 
third countries without us approval and set a production cap 
the plant was set up with the help of colt industries firearms 
division of hartford conn the maker of the army rifle and run 
by the korean government but the korean defense ministry 
transferred the operation and ownership to a private company 
daewoo precision industries in 1982 
following the transfer daewoo refused to pay colt the perrifle 
royalties it had been receiving under contract according to ronald 
stilwell colt vice president for military administration colt has 
sued both the company and the korean government 
colt began reporting to us officials suspicions that the 
korean company was exceeding the production cap according to 
warren nelson a house armed services committee aide 
later us government investigators uncovered solid 
evidence of unauthorized sales to one country and hints of 
sales to other nations nelson said 
we now have evidence that m16s made in korea have ended up in 
the hands of at least one other country in my judgment a country 
to whom the united states would have forbidden any sales said 
rep bill nichols dala chairman of the house armed services 
investigation subcommittee 
nichols said in a statement that there also is evidence that the 
korean company exceeded its production cap 
nelson said the identity of the third country was classified and 
could not be released he said the subcommittee was working to have 
that information declassified in time for a hearing thursday on the 
m16 investigation 
colt has learned independently that the korean firm has sold 
parts to indonesia through a singapore intermediary according to 
stilwell 
nichols compared the case to the sale of sensitive us 
submarine technology by toshiba corp a japanese company to the 
soviet union 
here is another problem with a private foreign firm that owes 
no allegiance to the united states or broad defense interests 
the congressman said 
as with the case of the toshiba sale of precision instruments 
to the soviet union daewoo appears more interested in the pursuit 
of private profit than the interests of our mutual defense 
alliance he said 
nelson said a general accounting office report on the allegedly 
illegal sales will be presented to the subcommittee at thursdays 
hearing 
others scheduled to testify include colt representatives glenn 
a rudd deputy director of the defense security assistance agency 
and regina eltz director of the office of security assistance at 
the state department

democratic frontrunner michael s dukakis refused 
to lay claim to the presidential nomination after primary wins 
tuesday in ohio and indiana but said its going to be difficult 
for rival jesse jackson to overtake him now 
i feel great about today and the results today the 
massachusetts governor told a boston news conference after racking 
up big wins in two of tuesdays three primary contests jackson won 
the district of columbia primary 
weve got to keep working dukakis said reminding backers 
he was still more than 500 delegates short of the 2081 needed to 
nominate 
despite a series of primary wins over jackson dukakis said the 
race for the nomination is not over he vowed to campaign 
aggressively through the final day of the primary season june 7 
when voters in new jersey and california cast ballots 
i think its going to be difficult he said when asked if 
jackson had a chance to win the fight for the nomination asked if 
he thought jackson would view the latest primary results as a 
trend dukakis smiled and said i hope so 
jackson has been increasingly critical of dukakis in recent 
days but the governor declined to say whether he thought his rival 
should tone it down 
hes going to have to make that judgment dukakis said 
im going to try to keep this as positive as i can i dont mind 
disagreement on issues i just hope we can both continue to 
campaign with the respect weve had for each other in the past 
year 
asked whether he believed president reagan was delaying an 
endorsement of vice president george bush to keep the media 
spotlight on the almostcertain republican nominee dukakis laughed 
and said you mean the astrology endorsement 
the white house acknowledged tuesday that nancy reagan checks 
the positions of the sun the moon and the stars in terms of 
scheduling the presidents activities however reagan said he has 
never based any policy or decision in my mind on astrological 
forecasts

the office of government ethics launched an 
investigation tuesday into a letter signed by attorney general 
edwin meese iii and sent to 30000 people encouraging them to 
attend a conference in japan the head of the office said tuesday 
night 
it started today said frank q nebeker head of the ethics 
office as a judge i have received invitations of this sort in 
years past i dont know at this point what this one is 
nebeker a former judge on the district of columbia court of 
appeals said he was not sure what the problems might be with the 
mailing adding were attempting to ascertain what the facts 
are 
in the letter meese is soliciting attendance at a meeting for 
which the us sponsor is a profitmaking organization 
the presidential order on ethics that is policed by the ethics 
office forbids federal officials from engaging in any conduct that 
might present the appearance of a conflict of interest or of losing 
objectivity in governmental decision making or favoritism the 
appearance of such a problem is enough to trigger an investigation 
even when such problems dont exist in reality 
it is a crime to use the justice department seal for 
nonauthorized purposes 
meeses letters on office of the attorney general stationery 
with the justice department seal invited the recipients to join him 
at a legal and economic conference in japan on aug 29 to sept 1 
meese will be heading the us delegation to the conference called 
the usjapan bilateral session a new era in legal and economic 
relations 
the meeting is sponsored in part by the citizen ambassador 
program of people to people international according to the letter 
while people to people international is a nonprofit 
organization set up originally in the state department by 
thenpresident dwight eisenhower the citizen ambassador program is 
a profitmaking organization the chairman of that firm said 
tuesday night 
yes the citizen ambassador program is forprofit which is 
how eisenhower established the program with the intention of making 
it selfsupporting norm swanson said in a telephone interview 
from his home in spokane wash 
swanson said the letter went to about 30000 people whose names 
were provided by everyone from the american bar association the 
advisory committees on both sides to the american chamber of 
commerce in japan 
justice department spokesman terry eastland said the department 
was unaware that a profitmaking organization was involved but he 
contended that even if it were meeses involvement might still be 
justified due to the departments interest in international legal 
questions 
people to people international came to us and represented 
themselves as a nonprofit taxexempt organization eastland 
said to the extent that theyre linked to some group that is 
profitmaking that was not known by those making decisions on the 
attorney generals participation 
in the event it turns out a profitmaking entity is involved 
it could be argued that the department could engage in a joint 
venture so long as it was in the departments interest and 
obviously we have an interest in international legal questions 
he said 
eastland said legal and ethics authorities in the department 
reviewed both this letter and a similar one sent by meese for a 
conference sponsored by people to people international last summer 
in china to make sure it was all right for the attorney general to 
participate the attorney general also hosted the american 
delegation in china last year in both cases meeses expenses will 
be paid by the department he said 
the twopage letter from meese was dated april 26 and says in 
part although attended and assisted by senior officials of the 
governments of both japan and the united states the conference is 
fittingly a nongovernmental one administered on behalf of the 
japanese by japans federation of economic organizations 
keidanren and on the american side by the citizen ambassador 
program of the people to people international organization 
i invite and encourage your participation sincerely edwin 
meese iii attorney general 
the letter was accompanied by an engraved invitation and a 
response card to be sent to the citizen ambassador program in 
spokane which would provide details on the trip 
swanson said he could not say how much profit might be involved 
for his firm which is quoting participants a cost of 3240 
including transportation and lodging and an 800 registration fee 
set by the japanese organizing committee 
i wish i knew he said its not large it depends on the 
participation in the conference those profits are used to 
encourage further exchanges as they have for the last 35 years 
meeses wife ursula was paid by people to people international 
to go on last summers china trip swanson said 
her way to china was paid last year by people to people 
international in return for the frankly exhausting role that she 
fulfilled in being head of the womens contingent for the 
conference swanson said this was an economic law conference 
in china which mr meese hosted last year and which was very much 
the precursor to the japanese meeting 
eastland said department regulations allow for payments for 
spouses to be reimbursed by an outside entity profitmaking or 
nonprofit making if certain conditions are met in this case the 
conditions were met he said 
swanson said the cost for the china meeting including 
transportation was about 2500 the registration fee there was 
400 
meeses expenses for the japan trip will be picked up by the 
government since he is making an official visit at the invitation 
of the japanese minister of justice yukio hayashida

nearly onethird of michael dukakis supporters 
in the ohio and indiana primaries tuesday said they would favor 
sen albert gore jr as his running mate if he wins the democratic 
presidential nomination 
even more about 40 percent in each state said they favored 
someone other than gore or jesse jackson as the vice presidential 
candidate and only a small share favored jackson for the no 2 
spot abc news exit polls said 
as he did in pennsylvania last week dukakis won all groups 
except blacks in both states but while the massachusetts governor 
commanded strong support in indiana in ohio more of his backers 
had reservations 
moreover voters expressed some unfamiliarity with dukakis a 
plurality of democrats in ohio and a majority in indiana said his 
ideology was just about right as opposed to too liberal and too 
conservative but another 34 percent in ohio and 28 percent in 
indiana said they didnt know 
dukakis is still somewhat of an unknown ideologically said 
doug muzzio a poll analyst for abc news a lot of people still 
dont have a handle on him this late in the primary season 
muzzio said 33 percent of the voters in ohio and 41 percent in 
indiana said jackson was too liberal 
dukakis encountered mixed results in his new effort to draw 
black votes from jackson in indiana a cbs newsnew york times 
poll said dukakis got about 12 percent of the black vote the abc 
poll put it at 8 percent 
in ohio the cbstimes poll said dukakis got just 4 percent of 
the black vote a share that was more in line with the earlier 
contests in which black support for jackson has been nearly 
unanimous 
in indiana and ohio he tried to pick up more black support 
and hes doing better in indiana but only a little better said 
cbs poll analyst brian becker among other groups he said 
dukakis is winning across the board 
while dukakis won few black votes jackson won limited white 
support 15 percent in ohio and about 10 percent in indiana the 
cbstimes poll said 
in indiana 51 percent of dukakis voters said they backed him 
strongly to 39 percent who had some reservations in ohio 
however 45 percent of the dukakis voters said they had some 
reservations about him and 41 percent were strong 
large shares of dukakis voters in both states viewed jackson 
unfavorably and only 60 percent of dukakis own supporters said 
they would back him with jackson on the ticket the cbstimes polls 
said similarly 60 percent of dukakis voters said jackson should 
not be offered the vice presidential slot 
the abc polls said only about 15 percent of dukakis voters in 
ohio and indiana favored jackson over gore or someone else for the 
vice presidential nomination just over 30 percent favored gore and 
about 40 percent said someone else 
sixtyfive percent of the dukakis voters in indiana and 59 
percent in ohio had an unfavorable view of jackson the cbstimes 
poll said 
as has been the case in other states dukakis fared better with 
jackson voters that jackson did with dukakis voters in indiana the 
cbstimes poll said 54 percent of jackson voters had a favorable 
view of dukakis to 38 percent unfavorable in ohio the split was 
48 favorable 41 unfavorable 
the abc poll found that about 60 percent of jacksons voters in 
both states said they would vote for dukakis if he were the nominee 
against bush and just about 6 percent said they would back bush 
while about a third said they would not vote based on 
previous history that will split disproportionately for dukakis 
said muzzio said blacks arent voting for dukakis now but given 
a choice of dukakis in the future will vote for him 
overwhelmingly 
the margin of sampling error for the polls was 3 percentage 
points

consolidated rail corp said tuesday it has 
tentatively agreed to pay 58 million to families of people killed 
in amtraks worst accident the 1987 collision of a passenger train 
with conrail engines in chase md 
the agreement was reached with attorneys representing the 
estates of the victims and is subject to the approval of conrails 
directors and various courts according to a conrail statement 
conrail spokesman don holloschutz said he did not know how many 
of the victims families the agreement covers 
the 58 million would be in addition to the 75 million conrail 
has agreed to place in escrow as a part of a proposed settlement 
with those injured in the collision he said 
conrail said it did not concede liability for the accident in 
the proposed settlements 
on jan 4 1987 former conrail engineer rick l gates missed a 
track signal and drove three linked conrail locomotives into the 
path of a 660passenger amtrak train traveling an estimated 125 mph 
the accident the worst in amtraks history killed 16 people 
and injured more than 175 
conrail is suing to force amtrak to cover payments for the 
passenger injuries and deaths contending that a prior agreement 
required amtrak to cover the payments 
if that suit fails conrail will pursue its claims against its 
insurers according to the company 
gates who wasnt injured in the accident was sentenced earlier 
this year in baltimore county circuit court to five years in prison 
after pleading guilty to manslaughter gates brakeman at the time 
of the crash edward cromwell was granted immunity from criminal 
action after agreeing to help prosecutors 
gates an acknowledged alcoholic has admitted smoking marijuana 
on the train but the court ruled that it could not determine if he 
was under the influence of the drug at the time of the accident 
gates also faces charges in us district court in baltimore for 
conspiracy obstruction of an agency investigation and lying to 
investigators from the national transportation safety board about 
drug use

religious beliefs do not excuse four 
polygamist clan members from blame for a church bombing and 
standoff with police that they claim were mandated by god a 
prosecutor said tuesday 
assistant us attorney richard lambert in closing arguments 
capping the federal trial of the four defendants admonished jurors 
not to ask themselves what they would do if they felt divinely 
inspired to break the law 
there is no revelation exception to the laws of the united 
states he said 
lambert was among a trio of prosecutors wrapping up their cases 
against clan matriarch vickie singer her soninlaw addam swapp 
swapps brother jonathan swapp and mrs singers son john 
timothy singer they are charged in the jan 16 bombing of the 
mormon churchs kamas stake center and an ensuing 13day standoff 
at their marion farm 
the prosecutors were followed by summations from defense 
attorneys after instructions from us district judge bruce 
jenkins the jury was expected to begin deliberating sometime 
wednesday 
clan members have said they believe god ordered the bombing as a 
sign of the impending collapse of church state and nation and 
that he guided them through the siege the standoff ended in a 
shootout that killed state corrections lt fred house and wounded 
addam swapp 
us attorney brent ward said mrs singer 45 was as much a 
part of the bombing as addam swapp who admitted on the witness 
stand that he planted the dynamite he was the only one of the four 
defendants to testify 
while conceding that mrs singer never actually took part in the 
bombing ward contended that she aided swapp making her just as 
guilty of committing that crime herself 
they were just waiting for the day this was the biggest thing 
in their lives since john singer pulled a gun on lawmen several 
years ago ward said 
the prosecutors reference to john singer the slain polygamist 
husband of mrs singer drew hard stares from his widow singer was 
gunned down in 1979 at the same farm by lawmen serving arrest 
warrants stemming from his refusal to send his children to public 
schools 
however mrs singers attorney kathyrn collard countered that 
prosecutors had simply no evidence that vickie singer committed 
any of these crimes that she is accused of 
collard said mrs singer consistently stated that during the 
standoff she would simply pray and trust in the lord hardly 
the words of a hardened criminal bent on killing fbi agents 
ward cited mrs singers telephone statements to an fbi hostage 
negotiator and a reporter the day of the bombing he also referred 
to her diary and prayer cards which asked for a divine blessing 
on the 87 sticks of dynamite 
assistant us attorney david schwendiman focused on the 
attempted murder and assault charges devoting much of his time to 
evidence against john timothy singer 21 
schwendiman argued that singer decided to kill lawmen when he 
took aim at the doorway of a nearby building where a sixman fbi 
team house and another dog handler had secretly hidden themselves

the tonight show will resume production 
may 11 with johnny carson writing his own material after talks with 
striking scriptwriters failed the entertainer said tuesday 
carson is believed to be the first independent producer to defy 
the strike by the writers guild of america which began march 7 he 
will write his opening monologue and guest introductions with no 
striking writers returning to work his statement said 
carsons attorney ed hookstratten said he was stupefied by 
the wgas apparent lack of desire to negotiate in good faith 
wga spokeswoman cheryl rhoden said tuesday that union 
negotiators talked with carsons production company earlier in the 
day and added that we are ready and willing to continue to 
negotiate in good faith 
because carson is not a guild member he would not violate the 
strike by writing his own material ms rhoden said 
in his statement carson said he had exhausted every 
possibility of reaching an agreement and was concerned about his 
shows staff 
there are numerous tonight show staff members many have 
been with us for over 20 years who are in danger of losing their 
jobs if this strike goes on much longer i cant let that happen i 
also cant turn my back on the tonight show audience whove 
remained loyal these past 25 years its time to go back to work 
brandon tartikoff president of nbc entertainment welcomed 
carsons decision the network has been airing reruns during the 
strike 
tv and nbc are not the same without him tartikoff said 
ms rhoden said carson tonight inc the entertainers 
production company had met with the guild six times since march 
23 with the last formal session on april 28 the company has been 
seeking a waiver from the strike or an independent agreement with 
the guild 
hookstratten said the production company had agreed to nearly 
all of the unions contract conditions before the guild informed 
carson last week that it would not ratify any independent contracts 
until at least 10 percent of its 9000 members had been offered 
jobs by independent producers 
the guild has approved only two independent contracts so far 
with the new smothers brothers comedy hour and ivan reitman 
productions makers of the movie ghostbusters 
the main issues in the writers strike against television and 
movie producers are payment for foreign broadcasts and reruns and 
the writers degree of creative control they have over their work 
there have been no formal negotiations since mediated talks broke 
off march 10

in his preaching from the bible a roman 
catholic priest goes literally by the book telling parishioners 
they must sell all worldly possessions and give their money to the 
poor 
for this literal interpretation of the gospel the rev michael 
collins has been forced to leave three northern illinois parishes 
its scary for me but as much as i would like to tell people 
what they want to hear ive got a god who tells me to tell people 
what theyve got to hear said the 28yearold priest 
he currently is at st anns catholic church in crest hill near 
joliet but has no regular congregation and no assignment at least 
until june 
until then leaders of the diocese of joliet want him to write a 
book outlining his beliefs so they can check it against catholic 
doctrine 
christianity means living like christ lived giving like 
christ gave and forgiving like christ forgave nothing less jesus 
didnt say make a truce with me he said surrender collins 
said 
he isnt ready to make a truce 
my message is scary he said in a recent interview it 
says when youve got nothing left but the lord youve got all you 
need 
collins lanky and bearded with long hair said his message was 
hard for some to swallow the gospel should bring comfort to the 
discomfortable and discomfort to the comfortable he said 
after st mary of the lake seminary in mundelein collins first 
attracted attention while serving as a deacon at st theresas 
catholic church in kankakee in 1984 and 1985 
his homilies shocked the congregation he recalled 
despite adverse reaction to his strong teachings collins was 
ordained and given a fiveyear assignment as an associate pastor in 
a bolingbrook church he declined to name 
he lasted five months and left because of a personality 
conflict he said 
his next scheduled fiveyear assignment was st anns catholic 
church in oswego among the ideas he pushed there was closing the 
parish for a month so the priests could fast and pray 
there was a lot of excitment and turmoil said collins 
and about a year after i arrived they asked me to leave 
then he was assigned to the fast growing uppermiddleincome 
suburb of naperville not far from where he grew up in elmhurst 
these are my people out there he said i should be just 
like them but the values of the suburbs are symptomatic of the 
deeper conflicts inside us we cling to status and material 
things 
so collins suggested sts peter and paul catholic church turn 
the building over to the homeless 
a letter to a local newspaper denounced him as a zealot 
attempting to change the character of the entire parish 
parishioner randy schultz said many in the congregation thought 
his message was better suited for missionary work 
some churchgoers sided with collins 
he said things a lot of catholics are longing to hear said 
maggie thomas 
yet collins said he left naperville because he didnt want to 
further divide the parish and retreated to crest hill to write his 
book

somehow they dont seem made for each other 
imagine eugene oneill americas greatest and windiest 
playwright and television the medium that shrank the countrys 
attention span 
but director jonathan millers rapidfire revival of oneills 
long days journey into night works better on the tube than it 
did in the theater 
the production tonights offering from american playhouse 
on pbs was seen on broadway two years ago it stars jack lemmon as 
the tyrannical james tyrone and bethel leslie as his drugaddled 
wife mary their sons are played by peter gallagher who appeared 
in the television movie the murder of mary phagan and kevin 
spacey before he turned into one of tvs more memorable villains 
on wiseguy 
miller created quite a fuss in new york with his revvedup 
version of what is considered oneills greatest and most 
autobiographical play by overlapping dialogue and a little 
cutting miller slashed the running time from four hours to three 
the real topic of the play is a series of tellings and 
listenings of tellings and halflistenings of tellings and 
failing to listen miller said in an interview with the british 
theater magazine plays and players 
everyone talks in long days journey into night which takes 
place over one long summer night in 1912 and the conversations are 
acrimonious selfserving and ultimately heartbreaking 
james tyrone is a vainglorious husband and father mary is a 
defeated woman taking refuge in morphine her older son jamey a 
halfhearted actor finds his solace in liquor while the younger 
boy edmund a wouldbe writer modeled after oneill himself finds 
his career threated by tuberculosis they blame each other never 
themselves 
in the theater the simultaneous conversations turned to mush 
on television closeups keep the audience in touch 
lemmon and miss leslie are more successful on the small screen 
too revealing depths that were missing from their theater 
performances lemmon captures the preening selfcentered qualities 
that destroy tyrones wife and turn his sons against him if the 
ultimate tragedy eludes him he gives the character a degree of 
credibility 
miss leslie is a surprise she seemed strangely muted on stage 
unable to project the unbearable sadness of a woman overwhelmed by 
life that desperation comes across in the television version and 
even acquires a delicate other worldly character 
spacey and gallagher were the strongest actors on stage and 
their strengths still are evident here spacey is particularly 
moving as the bitter son who realizes he has failed and can do 
nothing about it 
this year is the centennial of oneills birth and long days 
journey into night will be very much a part of worldwide 
festivities a revival directed by ingmar bergman just opened in 
stockholm to rave reviews 
jason robards and colleen dewhurst will star in a revival this 
summer on broadway directed by jose quintero 
the broadway production and cast will alternate performances 
with ah wilderness oneills only comedy 
ah wilderness represents a sunny innocent family life 
that oneill wished for but never found long days journey was 
the other side of his psyche millers television production 
explores it with uncommon and unnerving grace

robert altman almost declined to direct the 
television version of the caine mutiny courtmartial until he 
realized how many people were glued to their tv sets every day for 
the irancontra hearings 
i thought if i can do the same thing maybe theyve trained 
an audience for me altman said 
trained or not audiences seeking fine drama will do well to 
catch the caine mutiny courtmartial sunday on cbs the play is 
still riveting altmans direction is poetic and the performances 
by his distinguished young cast are superb all the way around 
altman bestknown for his feature films mash 
nashville and a veteran of filming stage works streamers 
come back to the 5 amp dime jimmy dean jimmy dean said he at 
first had no interest in the project because of the 1954 edward 
dmytryk film classic the caine mutiny which starred humphrey 
bogart as quintessential petty tyrant capt queeg 
this is not a remake of the movie but rather the broadway play 
herman wouk adapted from his pulitzer prizewinning novel the 
movie was based on the entire novel the play is just the 
courtmartial the dramatic core of the book 
altman who coproduced the piece intentionally cast a younger 
queeg than audiences who remember bogart will expect brad davis 
midnight express 
queeg was 37 years old in that book and brad davis is 38 
said altman i tried to bring all those ages down to what was 
real 
it was a wise move davis makes the role his own 
eric bogosian a new york actor and playwright talk radio 
will be new to most viewers though hes done guest shots on such 
network shows as crime story and miami vice hes excellent 
as lt greenwald the reluctant defense attorney 
jeff daniels plays lt maryk the nottoobright young officer 
on trial for mutiny for relieving queeg of command in a typhoon 
peter gallagher the murder of mary phagan plays lt cmdr 
challee the prosecutor who gets more than he bargained for 
kevin j oconnor has a small but meaty role as lt keefer the 
noncommittal witness who turns out to be a pivotal character in 
the drama 
michael murphy who stars in the hbo series altman is directing 
tanner 88 plays capt blakely the judge 
the tragic figure in that case to me was challee said 
altman hes the guy who felt betrayed 
as the courtmartial opens challee is so sure of his case 
against maryk he has talked his friend greenwald into serving as 
defense attorney at first greenwald is contemptuous of his own 
client and seems almost negligent in his defense 
but greenwald wants to win and as the courtmartial progresses 
he takes his distasteful task to heart expertly baiting queeg 
until the captain breaks down on the stand before the shocked but 
sympathetic courtmartial 
altman didnt get much of an audience for his first network tv 
projects the harold pinter plays the dumbwaiter and the 
room for abc 
the caine mutiny courtmartial is a lot more accessible to a 
large audience as evidenced by viewer interest in the irancontra 
and bork hearings and the success of television shows about 
lawyers theres a natural drama to the courtroom setting 
altman enhances wouks piece with a unique brand of realism the 
camera roams around the courtroom like an eye picking up details 
here and there like queegs incessant clicking of two steel ball 
bearings to calm his nerves true to the altman style characters 
talk over each other in asides that cant quite be made out until 
a conversation finally predominates 
in the first half of the drama a band practices outside on the 
parade field providing patriotic background music for the 
prosecutions case when the defense takes over the next day it is 
raining 
in an especially poetic moment after queeg has been excused 
from the stand altmans camera stays on him in a very long shot as 
he leaves the far end of the building a lost and broken man 
i think at the end after its all over therell be a lot of 
that what was that whos the bad guy thats what i want 
said altman who seems to have already gotten the only review he 
needs 
i got a nice letter from herman wouk who said it was the first

and we are going forward with research on a new orient express 
that could by the end of the next decade take off from dulles 
airport accelerate up to 25 times the speed of sound attaining 
low earth orbit or flying to tokyo within two hours

the idea has a nice ring to 
it tokyo in two hours zooming over the earth at 25 times the 
speed of sound crossing the pacific in an airplane so 
revolutionary the space shuttle and the concorde become old hat 
third millenium here we come 
that airplane or something like it is taking shape at this and 
other nasa centers in bits and pieces a model is assaulted in a 
wind tunnel by 4800 mph blasts in temperatures hundreds of degrees 
below zero an electron beam illuminates air flow around a 
scaleddown plane a sleek cylinder zips through a water trough 
3000feet long sensitive to every nuance of resistance a 
photograph captures shock wave and heat patterns in ghostly hues of 
green orange yellow blue and magenta the most powerful computer 
ever built ingests worldclass problems and spits out answers a 
standard airplane circles over chesapeake bay piloted not from the 
standard cockpit in front but from a second allelectronic one 
in its passenger section 
the little a in nasa the aeronautics part of national 
aeronautics and space administration is not as flashy as the 
big s and gets only 7 percent of the agencys budget but its 
accomplishments brush our lives in thousands of ways 
a poultry plant in marietta ga is quieter because of nasa 
aeronautics water quality in many places is improved because of 
aeronautics technology firemen wear better protective clothing 
we are called the space agency by many probably including 
yourself jeremiah f creedon the director for flight systems at 
the langley research center tells a visitor a bit of resignation 
in his voice many of us here think the a is a large one 
langleys work is divided roughly 60 percent aeronautics 40 
percent space with a hefty dose of military work in both with 
other nasa research centers ames and dryden in california and 
lewis in ohio its business is to develop technology and pass it 
on without cost to aircraft companies the federal government has 
played that role from the start of its involvement 70 years ago 
the agency has never built an airplane but few planes fly today 
without engines designs materials and structures conceived at 
nasa we are doing research that benefits the country says 
creedon it is available to boeing lockheed and mcdonnell 
douglas whoever wants to build transport or high performance 
aircraft no single company alone could afford nasas 2 billion 
investment in wind tunnels 
here at langley they dont talk about the orient express 
its either the nasp the national aerospace plane or better yet 
the x30 next in a string of experimental planes that began with 
chuck yeagers x1 breaker of the sound barrier 
when president reagan made his rosy prediction about the orient 
express a week after the challenger space shuttle disaster 
engineers had already taken years to decide the x30 was possible 
reagans oneparagraph announcement signaled the start of phase 2 
perfecting the technology which will last until the summer of 
1990 when engineers will take a hard look at where they stand and 
decide whether to build the x30 phase 3 in the mid90s would 
see the aerospace plane begin flight tests that would finish as the 
21st century begins 
thats the timetable for the largest experimental aircraft 
project ever undertaken by the united states it will cost 33 
billion clearly nasa and the air force which is sharing the cost 
have something more practical in mind than building one or two 
prototype planes merely to prove it can be done 
the military and packagedelivery firms such as federal express 
and ups are the only ones likely to have use for a plane flying 25 
times the speed of sound fast enough to get into orbit but the 
aerospace plane will provide the technology for the somewhat slower 
but far more useful aircraft of the future

there is tremendous potential for all kinds of vehicles 
operating at high mach numbers says douglas dwoyer manager of 
hypersonic technology at langley the national aerospace program 
is aimed at an experimental aircraft to demonstrate technologies 
for this family of hypersonic aircraft 
the speed of sound which varies with temperature and density of 
air is represented by a mach number airplanes that fly below mach 
1 are subsonic those that fly faster are supersonic those that 
fly more than five times the speed of sound above mach 5 are 
designated hypersonic to escape the atmosphere into orbit a plane 
must achieve mach 25 
so far the big airplane manufacturers have little interest in 
building passenger aircraft that fly at mach 25 no matter what the 
president said they do want for the years 2000 to 2010 a 
supersonic airplane capable of flying at mach 2 to mach 35 at 
mach 27 a trip from los angeles to tokyo would take just under 
four hours compared with 12 to 14 hours subsonic the ideal mach 
number is one of the big questions facing the engineers 
the united states researched a supersonic transport the sst in 
the 1960s but dropped the program in 1970 because of costs the 
space shuttle had been designed the apollo moon program was 
winding down and there seemed no need for space missions requiring 
reentry with the accompanying hypersonic speeds 
in addition the price of jet fuel which had been 10 cents a 
gallon when research started jumped to 130 
while american interest dropped the british and french produced 
the concorde a plane capable of twice the speed of sound but its 
birth coincided with heightened environmental concerns and the 
sonic boom scared people many governments including the united 
states barred it from flying over land 
moreover the concorde was designed with 60s technology and 
carries barely enough fuel to make it across the atlantic 
concorde is restricted to overwater flights under 2200miles 
long and there arent many oceans that small says roy harris 
jr director of aeronautics at langley i think concorde is 
designed too small it can carry only 100 people and its cramped 
all our studies say you really want 200 to 250 passengers for an 
economically viable sst 
harris sees a real need for an sst if you look at the 
demographics of air travel the pacific rim is the fastest growing 
international market he says its growing at a rate twice 
that of the market between the us and europe 
the united states is not alone in its sst interest the british 
have a project called hotol thats vaguely similar to the x30 and 
the french are working on the hermes space plane which requires 
hypersonic technology for reentry there is big interest in the 
soviet union in the engines that will power hypersonic flight and 
the japanese are talking about building a shuttle 
despite such competition the united states treats its 
aeronautics limb as a poor relative in a 9 billion nasa budget 
the spending for this years aeronautics rampd is 430 million with 
53 million of that earmarked for the aerospace plane 
harris says if the united states wants to develop a supersonic 
transport to be ready in the first decade of the 21st century it 
will have to commit 800 million over the next five to seven years 
current spending is 3 million a year 
money is a sensitive issue at langley until 1970 the us jet 
transport industry had 90 percent of the longrange market now 
that percentage is down to 70 aerospace exports grew from 17 
billion in 1960 to 25 billion in 1987 but imports increased from 
61 million to 79 billion in large part due to the success of 
the french airbus 
dwoyer says the aerospace type plane is a concept so 
revolutionary that whoever gets it first will have a tremendous leg 
up in the next century 
and if the united states isnt in front he says we might be 
flying the pacific rim in a honda

leonard bernsteins musical 
candide is whistling a happy tune in a scottish opera 
production that aims to be the fullest version yet of this show 
the joy here is were actually doing what lenny bernstein 
wanted for 30 years said john mauceri music director of 
scottish opera about the companys new candide which opens 
may 19 at glasgows theater royal 
its the first time the piece will be seen in britain since a 
pareddown 13instrument version played the edinburgh festival in 
1981 codirected by jonathan miller and john wells and boasting an 
orchestra of 60 it transfers in december to londons old vic 
theater where miller is artistic director 
american tenor mark beudert sings the title role of the 
eternally hopeful candide who learns to be properly skeptical of 
this best of all possible worlds the show is adapted from 
voltaires 1759 french novel about the limits of optimism during 
the european enlightenment 
mauceri an american who assumed his post with scottish opera 
last august said the current candide has a melodic and 
thematic breadth that will surprise those accustomed to its earlier 
versions 
the two things lenny objected to before were the placement 
of the songs and its constant silliness said mauceri who became 
acquainted with the work when bernstein asked him to conduct the 
1974 broadway revival 
theres a greater seriousness of purpose in this candide 
he said but at the end of the day why were doing it is 
because of its wonderful score 
that score with such tunes as glitter and be gay and oh 
happy we is the unassailable strength of a show that has had a 
patchy onstage past 
its 1956 new york premier with broadway veteran barbara cook as 
candides beloved cunegonde lasted just 73 performances despite a 
book by playwright lillian hellman and direction by tyrone guthrie 
it subsequently flopped in london in 1961 
the jazzy 1974 revival rewritten by hugh wheeler and directed 
by harold prince won five tony awards and ran for 740 
performances but it suffered from what mauceri called a marx 
brothers tone that violated voltaires pungent satire 
a third version with lyrics by the american poet laureate 
richard wilbur joined the new york city opera repertoire in 1982 
the glasgow production embraces all three in what mauceri calls 
a framework for candide in which all the viable songs 
actually fit 
people are becoming more and more aware that his music is 
really good mauceri said of bernstein who turns 70 on august 25 
codirector jonathan miller said he was intrigued by the 
peculiar history of the show 
its like trying to darn an enormous spider web said 
miller whose varied directing credits include verdis 
rigoletto updated to new yorks little italy in the 1950s for 
the english national opera and a speedy staging of eugene oneills 
long days journey into night on broadway and in london 
neither miller nor mauceri said they paid much heed to the 
debate over whether musicals belong in the opera house 
i see the two as a continuum said mauceri who won a tony 
award for coproducing the 1983 broadway revival of rodgers and 
harts 1934 on your toes 
dreamgirls should not be produced by an opera house but my 
fair lady could be he said 
miller compared the two genres to different animal species as 
opposed to being totally distinct 
im not sure candide is an opera at all miller said i 
dont quite know what it is one doesnt have to make up ones 
mind

after 5 years of expansion the economy is 
gaining a second wind the evidence is not easy to accept since it 
appears at odds with history but it also appears incontrovertible 
inflation is in check a million jobs have been created in three 
months wages are steady rather than inflationary productivity 
which many thought to be waning continues to improve 
manufacturing is strong 
the consumer thought by many to have run out of cash and desire 
earlier this year has been helped by rising personal income 
corporate earnings are coming in stronger than anticipated 
while the trade deficit continues and even grew worse in the 
latest period reported it also seems destined for improvement 
corporations have lost their fear of expanding production of 
manufactured export items is growing 
many companies also are benefitting from earlier programs aimed 
at improving efficiency labormanagement cooperation has improved 
and the bulge of inexperienced workers that had lowered 
productivity now has been absorbed 
that old bugaboo the budget deficit remains so do the old 
worries about the dollar inflation recession competitiveness 
access to markets a low savings rate high household debt and 
dependence on foreign investors 
but the big fear of financial and economic calamity hasnt 
followed the stock market collapse it remains a factor in almost 
every stock market newsletter and economic commentary expressed as 
a fear but not as a fact 
overall according to an economic update presented this spring 
by the univeristy of michigans survey research center it now 
looks as if the great crash of 1987 will be recorded as an 
interesting nonevent 
stock market prices did have their sharpest oneday decline in 
history but according to the report there appears to have been 
very little cumulative consequence of that event on the real 
economy 
among the more remarkable aspects of the economys performance 
has been its propensity to steer down the middle between boom and 
bust month after month prices wages interest rates and 
productivity gains have been moderate 
as the good news is recognized if reluctantly by some 
pessimists it appears that a growing number of economists have 
pushed back their estimates of the next recessions onset 
six months ago the recession was forecast for now but now it 
is forecast for no sooner than very late this year or 1989 or 
even 1990 which is about as far out on the limb chronologically 
that any economist dares to stand 
reviewing the more recent analyses from banks brokers 
businesses and academe it becomes clear that the big unknowns 
being discussed today are less economic than political elections 
trade policies wars oil availability 
how could the stock market crash be an economic nonevent 
rather than a forecast of things to come 
for one thing very few families had large holdings of common 
stocks one study for example shows that less than 2 percent of 
households had more than 100000 of direct holdings 
more and more the crash is being viewed in technical rather 
than economic terms as an event that had little significance as an 
omen of things to come but as an internal failure of the market 
mechanism itself 
while it still has an impact on the thinking of many people 
that impact seems to be waning and helping to put it in the past 
are those encouraging economic statistics that suggest continued 
moderate growth

one sunday a month about 50 jews gather 
here for what they consider a religious service but they neither 
pray nor worship god without chants or ritual they sit in a big 
circle of folding chairs and talk about what it means to be jewish 
they call themselves humanistic jews agnostics and atheists 
largely in their 30s and 40s theyre devoted to discovering their 
jewish moral roots and adapting a 5000yearold religion to the 
late 20th century 
their approach echoes the antiestablishment themes of the 
l960s services at kahal braira meaning community of choice 
even resemble the old rap sessions 
we just grab a cup of coffee and start talking said john 
lisman 43 a biology professor and president of the humanistic 
congregation in watertown 
the subject might be how to talk to children about god 
intermarriage or the jewish sanctuary movement and nicaragua 
lisman joined the congregation because he wanted to educate his 
son and daughter in their heritage but not in the oldfashioned way 
we arent strongly religious but we still felt our jewishness 
is a very strong part of us lisman said 
while most of americas 10000 humanistic jews are products of 
the alienated generation of the 60s members also include older 
jews who dont believe in god yet want to hold on to the ancient 
religion on their own terms 
humanistic judaism was founded in 1963 in michigan by a 
disgruntled reform rabbi named sherwin wine when national news 
magazines learned about what they labeled an atheistic rabbi some 
traditional jews were alarmed 
but the divergence never caught on in a big way and in the 
intervening 25 years this detour from conventional judaism remains 
little known 
to observers and even some participants humanistic judaism 
seems an eccentric holdout from the alienated era in which it was 
born 
its the jewish answer to the godisdead movement that followed 
world war ii said professor eugene borowitz a theolgian at hebrew 
union college seminary in new york the greeks called it a 
failure of nerve 
like other jewish scholars borowitz regards humanistic judaism 
as inconsequential it doesnt seem to be getting very far he 
said in a telephone interview 
in the 1960s there were some people who were very angered by 
it because of a sense that it was too blatant a betrayal of 
judaism borowitz said but to the overwhelming majority of the 
jewish community secularism doesnt seem to be the wave of the 
future 
nevertheless from eight founding families humanistic judaism 
has grown to about 30 congregations nationwide three big enough to 
build synagogues in chicago cincinnati and farmington hills mich 
overseas it claims another 20000 adherents in 10 countries from 
argentina to australia 
small as its following is humanistic judaism aims to be an 
alternative to the traditions of orthodox conservative reform and 
reconstructionist judaism 
the others are godoriented said wine were 
peopleoriented we believe in the power of people to solve human 
problems 
humanistic tenets hold that judaism is not a religion but a 
historical culture that reason not faith is the route to truth 
and that the only reality is the natural world 
our philosophy of life is not prayer or worship but ethics and 
morality wine said 
at a recent morning service of kahal braira the subject was 
the jewish way of death rabbi beverly lerner a believer who was 
hired to advise the group gave a lecture on jewish customs of 
burial and grieving through the ages she also answered a chorus of 
questions 
one man asked about cremation it isnt kosher she said 
especially since the holocaust and the nazi crematoria 
a woman asked about whether miscarried babies can get a funeral 
and learned that in judaism babies arent considered fully human 
until they are 30 days old 
at the end of the 90minute service and a buzz of similar 
questions a committee was assigned to devise a humanistic funeral 
service 
people who dont believe in a traditional god have the same 
need to be meaningful ms lerner reminded them 
humanistic jews are obeying an impulse common to many 
surveys show that while the 58 million american jews 
increasingly forgo the weekly rituals practiced by their parents 
about 85 percent still observe the main holidays on the jewish 
calendar 
sylvia barack fishman a brandeis university researcher in 
jewish studies said theres a very strong desire not to break 
ties with the past 
american jews today are more comfortable with their jewishness 
than they were 30 years ago but they want to express their 
judaism creatively and thats why you get these strange hybrid 
rituals of the humanists i would call it creative revision of the 
jewish past

history is repeating itself on 
the isle of man as william the conqueror and his cohorts prepare 
once again for the battle of hastings in 1066 
only this time william will be an actor wearing chain mail and 
there will be television cameras looking on reporting the war as 
it happens 
with an 11week shoot on 18 european locations timeline is 
using oncamera reporters and an anchorman all played by 
professional actors to turn the distant past into the stuff of 
todays nightly news 
its a way to give history the immediacy and excitement of a 
fastbreaking news story said leo eaton the director and 
executive producer 
the sixhour 22 million series applies the tenets of broadcast 
news to over 400 years of medieval history 
the show featuring about 280 speaking parts and up to 5000 
extras is to be aired on public television in the united states in 
january and later on britains channel 4 
its dramatized but its not drama its history but its not 
a history lesson eaton said in an interview before flying to the 
isle of man a picturesque if blustery island in the irish sea 30 
miles west of england 
in the present segment the first to be shot its september 25 
1066 and the manx village of peel population 2500 is standing 
in for the french coastal town of st valerysursomme 
the norman duke william is waiting for the winds to change so 
that his troops can sail across the english channel and fight the 
battle of hastings on october 14 1066 
everybodys sitting about bored ready to go said 
production designer peter wooley as a motley group of local extras 
and actors rehearsed their scenes amid the ruins of a hilltop 
castle on the islands western coast 
in the pivotal scene the wind does change wooley said 
instead of william the conqueror he should have been called 
william the lucky 
the series will cover such events as the black death which 
wiped out onethird of the world populace during the 14th and 15th 
centuries and the conquest of istanbul then constantinople in 
1453 
eaton said he avoided recent events in choosing what to 
dramatize 
we first set down the parameters to cover the coming of 
christianity and the roman empire up to the industrial 
revolution said the director an oxford graduate who began his 
career as a teaboy on the set of the hit tv series the 
avengers 
beyond that history gets complicated you can no longer 
simplify it in quite this way 
the shows historical adviser janet meisel disagreed a 
medievalist would say the further back you go the more complicated 
history gets 
she said the complications make history interesting 
we are lulled by similarities in thinking ah yes they 
historical figures are just like us but they really werent 
said meisel wrapped in a scarf and a winter coat against the 
coastal chill 
the past is not like the present thats what makes it a 
useful intellectual exercise 
on sabbatical from the university of texas at austin where she 
is a professor of medieval history meisel said she approved of the 
shows efforts to make history accessible 
i know there are some historians who really object to the 
idea she said but i guess my feeling is that history is so 
badly taught as long as we have the football coach or the 
basketball coach whichever one isnt teaching english teach 
history id like to see history that looks right and is right and 
entertaining 
meisel said her task was to verify matters ranging from 
historical methodology to horns 
did vikings remove the horns on cattle or not she said 
we have this pseudoviking from a university whose particular 
field is agricultural animals in the middle ages whos saying you 
cannot have loppedoff horns 
but i can show you anglosaxon laws where people were in fact 
required to lop off the horns of cattle so you do not gore your 
neighbors or your neighbors cattle 
for locals such as blacksmith david daley timeline is an 
opportunity to recreate his reallife profession onscreen 
its good fun the island could do with something like this to 
put it on the map the 42yearold daley said 
his wife gillian has a bit part in the show as well playing 
what daley described as a lusty maiden or something 
coproducer gary witt had nothing but praise for his cast 
were smearing mud on their costumes and theyre letting us

windhoek southwest africa ap in a faroff garrison town 
blacks complain of abuse and atrocities by south african soldiers 
based there here in windhoek white secretaries take memos from 
black cabinet members and pour their tea 
officially south africas vision of southwest africas future 
reflects the hilltop harmony of windhoek the territorys capital 
rather than the garrison town oshakati near wartorn angola to the 
north 
but many southwest africans moderates as well as militants 
are deeply suspicious of south africas intentions toward africas 
last colony also known as namibia 
these suspicions were heightened in early april when president 
pw botha of south africa came for a visit and proposed new powers 
for his chief representative in the territory the proposal was 
seen as weakening the transitional government installed by 
south africa in 1985 to lay the groundwork for independence 
moderates who hold a majority on the coalition cabinet accused 
botha of undermining their efforts to gain credibility as an 
alternative to the proindependence guerrillas of the southwest 
african peoples organization swapo 
actions like this wont help force swapo to the bargaining 
table said the cabinets chairman moses katjiuongua a black 
who has threatened to quit were trying to get people to talk to 
us but you dont talk to people who dont have power 
swapo meanwhile carries on in its 22yearold bush war for 
independence despite heavy losses and south africas overwhelming 
military advantage guerrilla leaders and many others are skeptical 
of south africas professed willingness to allow united 
nationssupervised independence elections in the territory upon the 
withdrawal of cuban troops helping fight a prowestern faction in 
neighboring angola 
the united nations which formally recognizes the name namibia 
has designated swapo as the sole and authentic representative 
of the southwest african people atlhough more than 40 political 
parties operate in the territory by all accounts swapo would be 
the likely winner in a unrun election because of its strong 
support in the ovambo region around oshakati where about half the 
territorys 13 million people live 
but widespread doubts persist that south africa would agree to 
elections in which the marxistoriented swapo leaders had the edge 
on at least one major issue southwest africas moderates and 
militants share common ground both want an end to apartheidstyle 
laws that create ethnically based political structures and enable 
the 78000 whites to maintain segregated schools and hospitals 
botha although hinting at some flexibility on the issue has 
made it clear he wants to protect the group rights of whites 
the presidents chief representative in the territory 
administratorgeneral louis pienaar says whites should have the 
option of joining a nonracial system or maintaining a segregated 
administration to finance and run their own affairs 
the whites are only 6 percent of the population but they 
manage the infrastructure and the economy pienaar maintained 
they cant be written off because of their small numbers

politics and holds that whites dont need discriminatory laws to 
preserve their culture

economic activity is proceeding at a healthy pace according to 
a trio of government reports indicating rising factory orders and 
construction spending in march and growing firstquarter 
productivity 
the labor department said monday that productivity of us 
industry its efficiency in producing goods and services rose by 
an annual rate of 09 percent during the first quarter the gain 
reversed a 1 percent decline in the final three months of 1987 
excluding agriculture and government the businesses responsible 
for threefourths of the nations economic activity raised their 
output of goods and services by 27 percent with only a 17 percent 
increase in hours worked 
separately the commerce department said factory orders rose 16 
percent in march the increase to a seasonally adjusted 21608 
billion after no change in february and a decrease in january was 
seen as coming from both domestic and foreign markets 
the commerce department also reported construction spending rose 
by 15 percent much of it on government building and highway 
projects the jump was led by a 54 percent surge in government 
projects some of the result of congress overriding president 
reagans veto of an 88 billion highway bill last year 
on wall street bluechip stocks staged a modest rally but the 
rest of the market lagged in a sluggish session the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials rose 1094 to 204327 but declining 
issues outnumbered advances by more than 4 to 3 on the new york 
stock exchange 
the dollar was mixed against major currencies bond prices fell 
oil futures prices turned sharply lower in a wave of selling 
prompted by the failure of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries to set temporary production cuts on the new york 
mercantile exchange the june contract for west texas intermediate 
the us benchmark crude slid to 1714 per barrel down 85 cents 
from fridays close 
the productivity gains were surprising to most economists in the 
wake of employment reports showing the creation of nearly 1 million 
new jobs the first three months of 1988 
the reports showed wages and benefits increased at an annual 
rate of 34 percent in the first quarter raising the labor costs 
associated with each service or product by 24 percent annually 
those unit labor costs had soared at an annual rate of 45 
percent in the final quarter of 1987 triggering fears among 
several analysts that the nation was on the verge of wagedriven 
inflation 
productivity is the cushion you can put in between wage 
increases and price increases this is good news for inflation 
said david wyss an economist for data resources inc of lexington 
mass 
after taking inflation into account the first quarter wage 
gains gave workers no new purchasing power still it was the first 
time since the last quarter of 1986 that they have even kept pace 
with inflation

oil futures prices have turned sharply lower in 
response to opecs failure to set temporary production cuts in four 
days of negotiations 
on the new york mercantile exchange the june contract for west 
texas intermediate oil the us benchmark crude slid to 1714 
per barrel on monday down 85 cents from fridays close 
most of the ground was lost early in the day as traders reacted 
to the news that the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
had suspended talks over proposals to cut its output in conjunction 
witheindependent producers 
prices stabilized temporarily in the afternoon then slipped 
again in a late spurt of nervous selling 
prices for refined products also tumbled wholesale prices for 
unleaded gasoline fell 224 cents per gallon to 4937 cents while 
heating oil dropped 242 cents to 4595 per gallon 
opec ministers broke off their talks with several outside oil 
producers after saudi arabia scuttled a plan for cutting production 
temporarily 
analysts said the suspension of the talks and the saudis 
reluctance to agree to the cuts caused a violent shift of sentiment 
in the futures markets where prices had recently advanced on the 
expectation of a global move to reduce production

the stalemate that doomed opecs latest 
meeting also has dimmed prospects for creating a new global 
alliance of oil producers 
the 13nation organization of petroleum exporting countries says 
it will press ahead with efforts to establish closer ties with 
other oil producers but the going is likely to be slow 
opec wants to persuade as many independent producers as possible 
to join the cartel in restraining production as a means of boosting 
prices to opecs official target of 18 dollars a barrel 
hisham nazer the oil minister of saudi arabia said monday in 
vienna there was unanimous recognition in opec that it alone 
cannot keep supplies low enough to prevent prices from lagging 
last week a group of six independent producers led by mexico 
met with a committee of six opec oil ministers and presented an 
offer well cut our oil exports by 5 percent if you do likewise 
the two groups issued a joint communique declaring the 
beginning of a new stage of cooperation among some of the worlds 
biggest oilproducing countries 
but thats as far as it went the nonopec officials left town 
and all 13 opec ministers spent four days debating the offer only 
to suspend the talks after falling into a bitter impasse 
cartel leaders said they were not explicitly rejecting the 
nonopec offer they just wanted more time to think it over 
the offer by mexico egypt china oman malaysia and oman was 
for two months of production cuts starting may 1 
now that the starting date has passed and the opec leaders have 
gone home there is little chance that the two groups will get back 
to considering joint production cuts before next year thats 
because oil demand is expected to rise in the second half of this 
year eliminating the incentive on both sides to grapple with the 
problem of sharing any cutbacks 
this is likely to be welcomed in washington energy secretary 
john herrington has campaigned publicly against what he called 
efforts to create a world opec 
even so opec says it will try to sustain a dialogue with 
nonopec exporters including the soviet union which ranks as the 
worlds largest oil producer the united states is the worlds no 
2 producer 
it is important that we keep talking to them rilwanu 
lukman the opec president said of the six independent exporters 
who met in vienna the opportunity given to us is one that we 
cannot take lightly 
the reasons are obvious opecs capacity for influencing oil 
prices gradually has been eroded by the emergence of new oil 
producers in all corners of the globe 
ironically it was the sudden and severe increases in opec oil 
prices in the 1970s that created the financial incentive for 
countries to step up their search for oil in recent years norway 
china angola colombia and many other nations have become oil 
exporters 
as production outside its control steadily rose opec 
reluctantly chose to cut its output in a vain attempt to prevent 
prices from falling 
today the cartel pumps about 175 million barrels a day 
compared with a peak in 1978 of 31 million barrels daily in that 
same period nonopec output has jumped from about 22 million 
barrels daily to more than 28 million 
this year alone nonopec oil output is expected to rise by 
800000 barrels a day opecs output probably will not grow at all 
all oil exporters naturally want as high a price for their 
product as possible but they seem to have little prospect for 
overcoming the political and economic differences that make formal 
cooperation with opec hard to achieve 
there just isnt a community of interest between them said 
paul mcdonald a londonbased oil consultant youre either a 
member of opec or not nobodys knocking down the door to join 
opec

us savings bonds will earn interest at a 
rate of 690 percent over the next six months the lowest return in 
a year according to the treasury department 
the department said the new rate which took effect monday is 
down from a 717 percent rate of return earned in the last six 
months and is the lowest rate since savings bonds earned 590 
percent from may to november of last year 
interest on savings bonds is adjusted twice a year on may 1 and 
nov 1 to reflect open market interest rates the rate is based on 
85 percent of the yield on fiveyear treasury securities which 
have averaged 812 percent over the past six months 
since the government switched to market rates for savings bonds 
in november 1982 the rate of return has averaged 85 percent 
investors who hold their bonds for at least five years earn the 
average of the halfyear rates 
in addition investors are guaranteed a minimum interest rate 
regardless of what the market rates do that minimum guaranteed 
rate is currently 6 percent but for bonds purchased before nov 1 
1986 the minimum is 75 percent 
jerrold b speers executive director the savings bond division 
predicted that sales would be boosted in the months ahead by a new 
bondsbyphone service which begins tuesday 
investors can call a tollfree number 1800usbonds and

interest rates on shortterm treasury 
securities shot up in the governments latest auction with rates on

stock market collapse 
the treasury department sold 64 billion in threemonth bills 
at an average discount rate of 613 percent on monday up from 592 
percent last week another 64 billion was sold in sixmonth bills 
at an average discount rate of 641 percent up from 628 percent 
last week 
the rates were the highest since threemonth bills averaged 684 
percent on oct 19 the day of the stock market collapse and 
sixmonth bills averaged 648 percent on dec 21 
concerns raised by rising interest rates have been cited as one 
of the factors contributing to the stock market collapse last fall 
the new discount rates understate the actual return to investors 
631 percent for threemonth bills with a 10000 bill selling 
for 984500 and 672 percent for a sixmonth bill selling for 
967590

national broadcasting co which operates the 
nations toprated television network plans a major cable 
television venture featuring original business and sports 
programming 
the move marks the networks biggest step yet into the cable 
industry which it long has eyed as a potential way to complement 
its overtheair broadcasting 
the general electric co subsidiary said monday it had signed a 
letter of intent to buy a cable television newtork tempo 
television and hoped to have new business and sports programming 
on it later this year or early in 1989 
terms of the deal were not disclosed 
we believe this is an important step in our efforts to broaden 
nbcs business base said nbc president robert wright who for 
some time has been looking to get the company into cable 
tempo which is based in tulsa okla and has about 12 million 
subscribers is being acquired by telecommunications inc the 
denver areabased company that is the nations biggest cable 
television operator 
a statement issued by nbc said that in addition to giving up its 
prospective interest in tempo telecommunications had agreed to 
offer the new programming services on its own cable systems and on 
affiliates that serve 8 million cable subscribers 
john malone president of telecommunications said we feel 
nbcs proposed services will be very appealing options for the 
cable viewer and believe the rest of the cable industry will be 
enthusiastic about this opportunity 
the announcement said nbc tempo and telecommunications hoped 
to sign final agreements by the end of may in the meantime nbc 
said it would discuss affilation agreements for the new programs 
with other cable operators 
nbcs wright frequently has expressed an interest in getting the 
company into cable television since ge acquired nbc in 1986 
nbc began talks last fall about buying a stake in turner 
broadcasting system inc but those negotiations were suspended in 
january more recently nbc said it had informally discussed with 
turner and other cable operators the possibility of selling 
broadcast rights to some events in the summer olympics nbc owns 
the rights to broadcast the games 
nbc also recently announced it had agreed to produce a new 
comedy to be aired on the disney cable channel 
this would not be the first corporate link between an 
overtheair broadcast network and a cable service capital 
citiesabc inc which owns the abc television network also owns 
80 percent of the espn cable network 
tempo television provides programming aimed mainly at viewers 
over age 45 in four categories entertainment travel 
sportsoutdoors and howto information 
nbcs plans call for it to replace that programming with 
business and financial news on weekdays and sports programming in 
the evening and on weekends according to spokesman joe rutledge 
the business news and financial information service would 
present consumeroriented features and information dealing with the 
market business trends and the economy the announcement said 
the sportsprogramming service would include live and taped 
coverage of sports events interviews with sports figures 
sportsoriented talk shows and magazineformat sports shows 
both services would rely on existing nbc operations but would 
be distinct from nbc television network programming rutledge said 
wright said the venture promises to strengthen nbc thereby 
preserving our longterm ability to provide firstclass programming 
to our overtheair broadcast audience

bargainers for the united auto 
workers and chrysler corp have returned to national contract talks 
after settling nagging issues that included the payment of millions 
of dollars owed to former american motors corp workers 
uaw president owen bieber said monday that the union had stalled 
national contract talks to force the company to settle 
wisconsinworker issues that had been in limbo since chrysler 
bought amc last august 
we had to get this piece settled before we could settle the 
rest bieber said now we can get down to the bigger 
things 
the national contract covers 66000 hourly and salaried chrysler 
workers in 15 states 
the two sides tentatively agreed monday on a separate master 
pact covering about 7000 former amc workers in wisconsin they 
also reached a fouryear local agreement covering 6500 of the 
workers including 5500 at the kenosha wis assembly plant 
slated for closing and 1000 at a kenosha engine plant that will 
remain open 
the master wisconsin pact will give kenosha workers about 88 
percent or 57 million of nearly 65 million that amc owed them 
when it was purchased by chrysler 
workers will receive 100 percent of the money they loaned amc in 
concessions in 1982 but will not get interest as amc had promised 
said chrysler spokesman lloyd northard 
about 9000 workers will be eligible for payments averaging 
6000 to 8000 apiece said ed steagall president of uaw local 
72 representing kenosha workers 
under the same pact about 200 milwaukee parts depot workers and 
425 laid off from a stamping plant there will receive most of the 
more than 5 million amc owed them 
bieber said the master pact also would guarantee laidoff 
workers six months of supplemental unemployment benefits which are 
paid in addition to regular unemployment compensation to provide 95 
percent of regular pay 
talks on chryslers national contract which expires sept 14 
opened april 18 last week the wisconsin talks were moved to 
detroit so bargainers for both sides could negotiate all contracts 
simultaneously 
the tentative kenosha local contract appears similar to a 
fiveyear agreement reached in october covering jeep plant workers 
in toledo ohio both pacts give the company more flexibility in 
using workers 
steagall said about 20 percent of the kenosha workers would be 
able to retire early and laidoff kenosha workers will have first 
crack at any new jobs at the engine plant there 
the uaw and chrysler agreed to negotiate over a new contract 
five months early working under the broad jobprotecting pattern 
set in contracts in place at general motors corp and ford motor 
co because of growing friction this year in their working 
relationship 
sore spots included chryslers january announcement of the 
kenosha assembly plant closing a sudden reversal of promises that 
the plant would run five more years and chryslers aborted 
attempt to sell its acustar inc parts subsidiary 
chrysler agreed to early talks in march but negotiations almost 
died following last weeks announcement of chairman lee iacoccas 
179 million 1987 earnings and other executive compensation and 
confirmation of plans to shift chrysler kcar production to mexico 
in july 
chrysler backed off of the kcar move last week announcing that 
production would stay in detroit until years end

by the investment group desert partners lp 
under its plan usg would borrow 22 billion to pay its 
shareholders 37 in cash debentures with a face value of 5 and a 
share of stock in the recapitalized corporation for each of their 
515 million common shares company officials said monday 
usg a chicagobased manufacturer of building products also 
said it would raise money to pay off the debt by selling its 
masonite corp and kinkead businesses and focusing operations on 
its core building products businesses 
the plan will be submitted june 24 to a vote of shareholders 
who also will be asked to rollover certain usg shares held in 
company employee benefit plans into new shares of common stock the 
company said 
as expected desert partners reaction was negative 
from what we have seen usgs proposal appears to be highly 
conditional and does not have financing in place we note that usg 
proposes to move shares into an employee plan said desert 
partners spokesman tom davies 
its not clear however what are the implications of that 
move with respect to control of the company we believe that the 
usg shareholders might prefer contrary to usgs recap our fully 
financed 45 per share proposal davies said in a telephone 
interview monday night 
earlier monday desert partners had tried to lure usg to the 
bargaining table by offering to increase its bid for the 
chicagobased manufacturer to 232 billion if the two sides can 
reach a friendly deal 
desert partners a partnership headed by two texas oilmen said 
in a statement that it was willing to pay 45 for each of 39 
million usg shares if the usgs management agreed to support the 
offer 
the remaining 125 million shares would be acquired for 
subordinated discount debentures carrying a market value of 45 
each giving the deal a total value of about 232 billion 
the partnership led by oilmen cyril wagner jr and jack e 
brown previously offered 42 a share in a hostile tender offer 
that bid including debt securities and warrants valued at 42 
each has a value of about 22 billion and remains in effect 
desert partners owns about 99 percent of usgs shares and said 
that as of friday about 193 million shares or 375 percent had 
been tendered under its 42ashare offer 
analysts said that desert partners latest proposal was rather 
conservative and that a bid of 50 a share would far more 
attractive to usg a manufacturer of paper plaster and wood 
products in takeover overtures last year desert partners 
indicated it was willing to pay 50 a share for the company 
on composite trading on the new york stock exchange usg rose 50 
cents to close at 4150 a share monday 
in proposing a friendly resolution desert partners chief 
financial officer joel l reed said that all aspects of our 
proposal including price are negotiable 
among the big bargaining chips usg executives control is the 
companys poisonpill defense which is designed to hinder an 
unwanted takeover last week a federal judge in chicago denied a 
request from desert partners to prevent usg from using the defense 
measure desert partners said it intended to appeal the ruling 
the poison pill is a way for management to negotiate said 
lawrence horan a vice president at the investment firm smith 
barney harris upham amp co 
what desert partners is trying to do is get usg management 
to negotiate not to sit there and say the companys not up for 
sale he added 
the standoff appears headed for a showdown at usgs annual 
meeting may 11 desert partners has nominated a slate of six 
candidates to usgs 15member board 
we believe the stockholders will demonstrate their support of 
goodfaith negotiations by voting for the desert partners director 
candidates reed said

e remy martin and compagnie announced that it has 
decided to drop its hostile bid for control of the liqueur and 
luxury products group benedictine sa in the face of a higher offer 
from saf martini and rossi 
after studying the profitability aspects of a higher bid we 
have decided to drop out of the running a remy martin 
spokeswoman said tuesday that leaves martini and rossi as the 
sole bidder and we wish them luck 
remy martins decision to give up the bidding came as little 
surprise to paris stock analysts who had suggested that the french 
cognac groups heavy debt burden was likely to prevent it from 
winning a bidding war with the swissbased martini and rossi 
under french stock market rules remy martins wholly owned 
subsidiary remy and associes unit would have had to offer at least 
five percent more per share than martini and rossis bid of 7700 
francs or 1350 to stay in the running 
that would have worked out to 8085 francs or 1418 dollars 
per share and would have put the minimum cost of a sweetened remy 
martin offer at 1132 billion francs or 199 million on the basis 
of benedictines current capital 
and if benedictine carried out a defensive capital boost it had 
planned to make to friendly institutions it would have worked out 
to 1199 billion francs or 210 million 
benedictines product range includes peppermint and 
herbalflavored liqueurs and aniseflavored apperitifs the company 
also has perfume and watch operations

boeing cos product line is being pitted against 
a mix of mcdonnell douglas corp and airbus industrie planes for 
what could be the largest single jetliner order ever industry 
officials said 
international lease finance corp expects to choose next week 
between 100 and 120 planes in an order expected to exceed 4 
billion the beverly hills calif company buys commercial 
aircraft to lease to airlines around the world 
steven udvarhazy president of international lease finance 
said quality control at boeing is a consideration in his companys 
purchase decisions after complaints recently from japan air lines 
all nippon airways and british airways boeing is working those 
problems and making corrections he said monday 
an incident in which a section of fuselage ripped away last week 
on a 737 flying over hawaii also is a factor along with economics 
udvarhazy said 
these are all factors we are looking for the best product 
the most reliable and with good economic terms he said 
he said his companys board of directors plans to make a 
decision on the order next tuesday company officials were to meet 
with boeing executives in seattle today 
we like to have the most popular aircraft in the fleet what 
airlines demand and what they feel comfortable with udvarhazy 
said 
boeing planes being considered include the 737500 737300 
737400 757200 767300er and 747400 
udvarhazy said the leasing company also is negotiating with 
mcdonnell douglas and airbus a european aerospace consortium 
its a strong possibility the order will be either for all 
boeing aircraft or for a split between mcdonnell douglas and 
airbus udvarhazy said he said a threeway deal is highly 
unlikely 
a 4 billion firm order would be larger than any in boeing 
history the companys largest order was for 41 billion worth of 
747400 jumbo jets in 1986 from british airways but that included 
options for 12 planes as well as 16 firm orders 
the international lease fleet is about 70 percent boeing and 
its customers include both domestic and foreign airlines 
neither mcdonnell douglas nor airbus alone offers the variety of 
aircraft sizes and ranges necessary to satisfy international 
leases airline clients but together they could produce a 
selection comparable to the boeing offering udvarhazy said 
airbus planes being considered are the a230 a330 and a310 twin 
jets and the fourengine longrange a340 st louisbased 
mcdonnell douglas is offering its twinengine md80 and md90s 
series plus the proposed md11 widebodied jetliner which has not 
yet flown 
some industry analysts said they expected boeing to get the nod 
boeings ability to deliver planes on time is the key factor 
they said airbus production capacity is nowhere near boeings 
last year airbus produced 32 planes compared with boeings 273 
with the value of the dollar where it is i dont see how it 
international lease cant not buy boeing planes said tom 
lloydbutler an aerospace analyst with montgomery securities in 
san francisco 
if there is a disadvantage to splitting an order between the 
three manufacturers its also probably true that theres no 
advantage to splitting it between airbus and mcdonnell douglas 
said paul nisbet an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc 
in new york

the federal government has filed a lawsuit 
against first national bank of chicago charging the bank with 
discriminating against men and women through various features of 
its pension plan 
the lawsuit filed monday by the equal employment opportunity 
commission asks that first national change its pension plans and 
pay monetary damages to employees 
no specific damages were mentioned in the lawsuit but eeoc 
spokesman john rowe said the amount would be very substantial 
the lawsuit involves one claim of discrimination against men and 
two against women 
the claim of discrimination against men is based on a provision 
in the pension plans that calculates pension amounts for each 
employee at retirement using a percentage of that persons earnings 
rowe said the men are credited with a lower percentage than 
women for employment before 1965 
the commission claims that the bank in 1970 in an effort to 
correct the problem lowered womens pension benefits to be equal 
to those of men a move the eeoc says is illegal 
a third claim involves the use of sexbased mortality tables for 
calculating pension benefits the commission said such tables 
result in lower monthly benefits for women because women retirees 
on average live longer than men 
rowe said the bank stopped using the sexbased mortality tables 
about four years ago but didnt change its practices for prior 
periods of employment

gillette co shareholders have rejected a new 
yorkbased investor groups bid to replace four company directors 
and seek to sell the personal care giant the company reported 
today 
a preliminary count of about 87 million shares voting in the 
proxy election indicate the four gillette directors received 52 
percent support to 48 percent backing the coniston groups slate 
for the threeyear terms gillette said 
coniston said it would request a recount 
in trading on the new york stock exchange gillete fell 225 a 
share to 39 after the announcement 
coniston launched a proxy battle in february pledging that if 
its candidates were elected to the board it would try to convince 
the other eight directors to sell bostonbased gillette 
the proxy ballots were submitted during gillettes april 21 
annual meeting and were counted by delawarebased corporation trust 
co 
coniston which controls 676 million shares about 58 percent 
of the 1155 million shares outstanding plans to call for an 
immediate recount of the ballots said coniston principal augustus 
k oliver one of the four coniston candidates 
oliver said the groups projections were higher than 48 percent 
we submitted a lot more votes than we seem to be getting 
credit for said oliver it puzzles us and well try to figure 
out exactly how many people were on our side 
in addition to oliver other coniston candidates included 
coniston principals paul e tierney jr and keith r gollust and 
former cable television executive david strassler 
in 1986 gillette headed off several takeover attempts by revlon 
group inc by signing a 10year pact and buying back revlons 
shares for nearly 580 million 
we are very pleased that the results of the preliminary count 
indicate majority support for the gillette directors platform to 
maximize stockholder value by continuing the companys plan to 
generate sustainable profitable growth above industry averages 
said gillette chairman and chief executive colman m mockler jr in 
a prepared statement released today 
mockler was among the four challenged directors the others are 
lawrence e fouraker herbert h jacobi and joseph f turley 
gillette spokeswoman joan fitzgerald said the proxy ballot 
announcement should have no affect on ongoing litigation filed by 
gillette and coniston last month in us district court 
a pretrial hearing is scheduled wednesday on the suits before 
judge rya zobel who previously refused to issue a temporary 
restraining order to block conistons proxy slate 
gillette claims coniston failed to fully disclose all its 
financial backers in a countersuit coniston charged gillette 
issued false and misleading information about coniston to 
shareholders 
oliver said coniston may request a new director election as part 
of the equitable relief sought in the countersuit

china plans to open up to five futures markets in 
the southern city of canton later this year becoming the first 
socialist country to take such a step according to a report 
published tuesday 
the englishlanguage china daily quoted unnamed sources as 
saying preparations were under way to set up three to five pilot 
markets in canton one of chinas most important business centers 
chinese leaders hope the markets will stabilize the economy and 
prevent drastic price increases that have become a main complaint 
of chinese citizens the newspaper said 
a futures market allows traders and producers to negotiate a set 
price for what they think a commodity will be worth at a future 
date the producer is guaranteed that price regardless of 
subsequent fluctuations in the market 
the report said officials from the cities of beijing and wuhan 
and the provinces of guangdong henan jilin and hunan met in 
midapril to discuss plans for the futures markets but did not say 
what commodities would be traded 
this is the latest development in chinas decadelong economic 
reform that has increasingly turned to capitalistic practices in 
its attempt to strengthen and enliven the economy 
the official economic daily earlier this year described how a 
futures market would solve the problem of gluts and shortages 
which often are the result of farmers inability to forecast the 
market 
both papers acknowledged that chinas backward communications 
and transport systems will be a problem but the china daily said 
the country cannot wait until everything is ready before 
carrying out the plans 
the paper said chinese leaders want to learn from the experience 
of foreign countries in futures markets and that experts from hong 
kong will be consulted 
it said no decision has been made yet on whether foreigners will 
be allowed to trade in the markets

union carbide corp has filed suit against 
at least 115 of its insurers in an effort to force them to provide 
coverage for cleanup legal and study costs stemming from pollution 
sites around the country 
the chemical giant filed two suits last week one in superior 
court in danbury where it is based and the other in state 
superior court in newark nj union carbide didnt disclose how 
much money it has spent on pollution defense or cleanup and 
company spokesman edward van den ameele wouldnt say 
defendants in the suits include aetna casualty and surety co 
and subsidiaries of travelers corp hartford insurance group and 
cigna corp there are also unnamed defendants in the suits 
robert d chesler a company attorney in roseland nj said 
union carbide still hasnt determined all of the insurance carriers 
that provided coverage 
some of the pollution occurred at union carbide plants while 
other problems cited in the connecticut suit stem from the 
companys disposal of its wastes at other sites 
in the new jersey suit the company seeks coverage for seven 
pollution sites in that state 
the sites were identified by the federal environmental 
protection agency and state environmental departments none are in 
connecticut 
spokesmen for the insurance companies declined to comment on the 
suits citing company policies on not discussing matters that are 
in litigation 
union carbide is among a growing number of companies suing their 
insurers over whether liability policies cover contamination of 
property and groundwater due to seepage of hazardous wastes 
united technologies corp for example recently sued more than 
240 of its insurers from the past 37 years to obtain coverage for 
134 pollution sites 
the connecticut suit seeks insurance for sites or situations 
including 
three pesticide dumping sites in aberdeen nc where union 
carbide shipped hazardous wastes from 1962 to 1970 
the laskin landfill in jefferson ohio where union carbide 
sent 60000 to 70000 gallons of waste oil from 1976 through 1981 
the northside landfill in zionsville ind to which union 
carbide sent 18 million gallons of calcium silicate and asbestos 
from 1974 to 1980 
union carbides plant in marietta ohio which made phel a 
strong corrosive poison from 1951 to 1971 
union carbides plant in yabucoa puerto rico where graphite 
electrodes are made 
a suit charged that the pesticide temik aldicarb made by union 
carbide polluted residential wells after it was applied to potato 
fields in suffolk county ny from 1975 through 1979 a 
settlement was reached in 1984 and the new suit doesnt give 
details union carbide says it continues to incur costs for 
testing monitoring and legal fees 
contamination of soil and groundwater from uranium milling at 
union carbides uravan site in montrose calif from 1923 to 1984 
the company signed an agreement last year to pay the state 28 
million 
union carbide also believes insurance should cover pollution

it looked like the movie wall 
street brokers wearing yellow yuppie ties waving id tags 
and shouting into walkietalkies jostled one another to make bids 
on the floor of the rio stock exchange 
but the object of the bidding was not stocks bonds commodities 
or precious metals it was part of brazils mountainous foreign 
debt of 121 billion 
thoughout latin america which as a whole owes the rest of the 
world 410 billion and has been unable to pay it back socalled 
debtforequity swaps are being tried as a way to break the 
impasse 
not everyone is enthusiastic about the idea which involves 
trading big debts for generally smaller amounts of equity in local 
enterprises 
some countries say the swaps cause inflation and lead to 
foreign domination of their economies some major creditor 
banks mostly us ones which sank billions into latin loans say 
the swaps force them to cancel their debt at too hefty a discount 
on the other hand many small banks in europe japan the 
middle east and american cities such as cleveland pittsburgh and 
dallas see the swaps as a way to salvage at least some of the 
money they sunk into the region in the 1970s 
swaps will never be a total solution to the debt crisis but 
they certainly are a step in the right direction said maarten l 
pronk the rio representative of hollands nmb bank currently the 
worlds no 1 middleman in debtforequity trades there are 
pluses and minuses on both sides but the overall result is very 
interesting 
in brazil which has just begun monthly debt auctions equity 
trades could reduce the countrys foreign debt by as much as 4 
billion this year officials estimate 
in a typical transaction a company hoping to start or expand a 
brazilian business purchases a certain amount of the countrys debt 
from a creditor bankat a steep discount and then brings that debt 
to market to bid against other companies on a repayment plan from 
the central bank of brazil 
successful bidders the ones who accept the biggest discounts 
from the central bank get repaid in local currency which is to 
be invested in their local enterprises the benefit to the 
companies comes in the difference between what they paid for the 
debt and what the central bank agrees to repay them for example a 
company might purchase debt at 50 cents on the dollar and then win 
a bid of 70 cents on the dollar from the central bank in the 
auction 
the government regulates the auctions screens the types of 
projects to be funded and sets quotas on the amount of debt it will 
repay while the process helps ease the national debt burden the 
regulations are designed to control the inflationary effects of the 
swaps which infuse the economy with fresh capital and increase the 
money in circulation 
brazil like most other countries also protects its end of the 
deal by requiring investors to keep their assets in the country for 
a period of years 
the rio debt auction was a complete success sergio 
barcellos the president of the rio stock exchange said in an 
interview 
another aggressive debt swapper is chile which still owes an 
estimated 217 billion but has traded off 3 billion worth 
thanks to such deals us australian new zealand and middle 
eastern private interests have bought into chilean mining 
companies private pension funds fruitgrowing firms and fishing 
companies 
some critics complain that encouraging foreign interests to swap 
debt for equity could lead to a denationalization of the latin 
american economy but in chile the authoritarian regime of 
president gen augusto pinochet says the swaps will continue 
especially since the country is writing off debt at the rate of 59 
to 61 cents on the dollar 
mexico the no 2 third world debtor owing 105 billion swapped 
some 2 billion of debt for local assets but stopped the program 
last year when the inflation rate hit a record 1592 percent 
under the mexican swaps made at a discount of around 30 
percent nissan motor co ford motor co chrysler corp 
volkswagen american express and club med acquired or increased 
holdings in the country 
argentina third among latin debtors with 55 billion owed this 
year held two debtforequity auctions and authorized 15 specific 
debtswap deals in these projects 241 million worth of debt is 
to be canceled in exchange for 139 million worth of ownership in 
two breweries a soft drink bottling plant a beer bottling 
company an auto parts firm and a manufacturer of insulin 
but juan ciminari the secretary of industry and foreign trade 
echoed mexicos worries about inflation with argentinas inflation 
rate running over 200 percent a year the swap program could get 
tripped up he said 
small poor bolivia has succeeded in reducing its 900 million 
debt to foreign banks by swapping part of it for local assets at 
the bargainbasement rate of 11 cents on the dollar but there is 
controversy because of fear foreigners will gain control of 
traditionally staterun companies 
venezuela has gone timidly into debt swaps uruguay says it 
intends to start them colombia and paraguay havent shown much 
interest in such operations while peru which has openly refused 
to repay most of its 167 billion debt doesnt consider swaps at 
all 
also generally in the antiswap camp are the giant us banks

farmers around the country are out kicking 
the tires on new tractors again and equipment sales are rebounding 
from postdepression lows so quickly many manufacturers are having 
trouble keeping up 
the situation has changed dramatically said dick 
unverferth president of unverferth manufacturing a kalida ohio 
company that makes tillage and grainhandling equipment and special 
farm vehicle wheels 
it went from a pretty sick apple to one where were on 
overtime and have been on overtime for quite a while said 
unverferth who heads the farm equipment manufacturers association 
a 330member trade group of small manufacturers 
while manufacturers anticipated an upswing with an improved farm 
economy most misjudged its size and momentum 
i never thought things would turn around to this magnitude 
this quickly said bud fleischer who runs a columbus neb 
company that makes tillage and planting equipment 
i thought it would be a gradual turnaround something you 
could adjust to he said we went from moderate production to 
extremely heavy production 
unless something happens to change things drastically in the 
next six weeks this could be a record year in sales for this 
company fleischer said 
the sales spurt has left farmers waiting months for new tractors 
and equipment as manufacturers attempt to fill an unexpected 
backlog of orders 
steel has become a precious metal because of the manufacturing 
push prices are up 20 percent to 45 percent for some tubing and 
steel bars that are in short supply machinery makers also report 
problems getting bearings 
in addition to farmer income factors propelling the surge 
include a nearly depleted inventory of good used equipment better 
commodity prices stronger export sales of grain and a continuing 
moderation of interest expenses and costs for fuel fertilizer and 
other materials 
farm equipment and industrial institute monthly sales surveys 
show a strong recovery in march manufacturers sold 9876 tractors 
compared with 7712 the same month a year earlier for the first 
quarter of this year 22986 tractors have been sold compared with 
18061 in the same period a year ago 
sales of combines and hay and forage equipment also are up 
sharply in the first quarter 
after record or nearrecord sales in the late 1970s as farmers 
expanded their operations equipment manufacturers and dealers were 
hit hard when the farm recession began during the early 1980s 
many farmers quit buying new equipment and either made used 
equipment purchases or just tried to get by with additional 
maintenance or repair 
dozens of little companies that made specialized machinery 
folded or scrambled to get into other product areas 
even the big manufacturers were hard hit a hallowed name in 
agricultural equipment for decades international harvester co 
sold its farm machinery division to ji case in 1984 so it could 
concentrate on making more profitable heavy trucks 
at deere amp co the no 1 ag equipment maker in the united 
states farm machinery sales peaked in 1981 when they began 
declining company profits followed in fiscal 1986 deere lost 
229 million its first loss since the great depression 
as the slump bottomed out sales and manufacturing capacity 
dipped to around 50 percent of previous levels said james 
ebbinghaus vice president of the farm and industrial equipment 
institute the institute represents large manufacturers who provide 
more than 90 percent of all the farm equipment and machinery made 
nationwide 
about a year ago things started to turn around ebbinghaus 
said sales stopped their decline and leveled off or started back 
up 
he said by the end of 1987 earlyyear losses had been recouped 
and the industry stood about even with its position at the end of 
1986 
us department of agriculture economists are predicting a 
modest increase in sales during 1988 
the big news is there isnt expected to be a decline for the 
first time in several years said stan daberkow a usda economic 
research service economist 
preliminary usda statistics show 1987 was the eighth consecutive 
year of declining farm equipment expenditures but when final 
figures are released in july they are expected to show a less 
severe decrease than in previous years daberkow said 
he and other ag economists say the improvement in net farm cash 
income the difference between gross income and expenses finally 
is affecting equipment sales for two years or more farmers who 
saw their incomes improve have used the money to pay off debts 
most economists agree 
the outlook of many farmers began changing about eight months 
ago according to economists and other equipment industry analysts 
its as positive now as its been in a long period of time 
ebbinghaus said 
deere amp co broke a string of five straight quarterly losses in 
the second quarter of fiscal 1987 the company hasnt had a losing 
quarter since and it has been calling back laidoff workers 
we expect the recovery to continue said deere spokesman 
brian alm we have what we call cautious optimism weve been 
through so much for so long we almost dont want to get too excited 
too soon

the chicago board of trade reflecting a variety of weather 
information analysts said 
beneficial rain fell overnight in missouri nebraska and extreme 
southwestern iowa and was headed today for central and southern 
illinois the improvement in growing conditions lent a weaker tone 
to corn futures 
but longerrange forecasts predicted dryness and belownormal 
temperatures in the east and moisture and abovenormal 
temperatures in the west 
its indecisive at this point said victor lespinasse a 
trader with dean witter reynolds inc generally rain is needed 
in the east theyve been having some moisture in the west 
the longterm outlook for grain and soybean prices remained 
bullish however lespinasse said 
i think were going to gyrate back and forth and consolidate 
the recent big gains before ultimately moving higher he said 
in early trading wheat was 1 cents to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 302 a bushel corn was cent to

the new york stock exchange on tuesday began 
requiring members to submit daily reports of their program trades 
a move designed to help the exchange analyze market volatility 
under the new rule nyse members and member firms must submit a 
log of program trades made for customers or for their own accounts 
including trades executed in other markets by the close of the 
second business day following the trades the exchange said in a 
statement 
members are not required however to identify customers for 
whom program trades were executed 
program trading has been blamed for much of the market 
volatility at the time of the october stock market crash the 
submission of daily data will enable the nyse to more routinely 
monitor and analyze program trading activity 
analysts were not surprised by the new rule which had been 
announced previously 
its going to require more forms more paperwork more time 
and its going to cost money noted perrin long an analyst at 
lipper analytical services 
but many said they support the move its a good idea because 
a lot of movement in the market is attributed to program trading 
that isnt said robert gordon president of twenty first 
securities corp he hopes the rule will dispell some concern over 
program trading activity 
analysts agree a separate possibility under consideration that 
would require members to identify within 48 hours all customers for 
whom any business was conducted has far more serious implications 
that proposal will come up against a great deal of 
resistance long said

kent hance one of texas three oil 
regulators says the state benefited from his attendance at last 
weeks opec meeting and he plans to keep those contacts open 
despite the criticism the trip drew 
were not trying to join opec and were not always going to 
agree with them said kent hance who sits on the threemember 
texas railroad commission but when president reagan tried to get 
nuclear arms stability he had to deal with the russians who are 
our enemies 
hance did not participate in meetings held by the organization 
of petroleum exporting countries but rather visited with some 
individual oil ministers during his stay in vienna austria 
the critical thing is were living in a world where someone 
else sets the price for our commodity we have to have input he 
said in an interview monday 
not everyone agreed one group called monday for hance to be 
prosecuted on charges of violating the logan act which bans 
private citizens from interfering with us foreign policy 
the citizen labor energy coalition which says it has 12 million 
members who favor low energy prices wrote us attorney general 
edwin meese urging that he prosecute hance 
it would appear that commissioner hances efforts to assist 
opec in fixing world oil prices are in direct opposition to us 
foreign and economic policy the letter said commissioner 
hance is carrying on a blatant campaign to assist opec in raising 
world oil prices and damaging us economic interests 
the opec meeting ended monday with no agreement on a proposed 2 
percent cut in the groups oil production a move aimed at 
stabilizing prices that have undergone big fluctuations since late 
1985 
the proposal was made after six nonopec oil countries offered 
to reduce their production if opec made a similar cut 
i am disappointed that they did not reach an agreement 
hance said i figured that if they didnt prices would slide a 
little temporarily and then they would come back 
despite the meetings breakdown however hance said he agreed 
with predictions that world oil prices would stabilize near recent 
levels 
in fact prices did take a hard fall amid market disappointment 
at the meetings failure but not low enough to match levels that 
existed before the opec session was called early last month 
at the new york mercantile exchange for example west texas 
intermediate the benchmark us crude fell 85 cents a barrel to 
1714 monday in early april it had traded in high 16 range 
for 40 years the texas railroad commission helped set world oil 
prices the commission has monitored oil output since an oil price 
crash in the 1930s and under state law the agency has authority to 
restrict production to avoid waste and to protect reserves 
hance made no apologies for his trip which also drew criticism 
from the reagan administration he said texas officials should 
attend the next opec session in june because what happens in 
vienna at the opec meetings will have more impact on our economy 
than anything that will happen in austin or in washington 
hance invited opecs president plus oil officials from several 
other nations to visit texas and learn more about the railroad 
commissions production monitoring system 
indonesia is coming wednesday he said adding that opecs 
president or his representative likely would visit the state this 
summer

a coalition that has urged dalkon shield 
claimants to vote against ah robins cos reorganization plan is 
ignoring the advice of their own lawyers a robins spokesman said 
tuesday 
they overlook the fact that the very committee that has 
represented them for over two years is urging that the plan and the 
system for settling claims be adopted said spokesman roscoe e 
puckett jr 
at a washington news conference monday karen hicks president 
of the dalkon shield information network called robins proposed 
plan of reorganization inadequate unfair and contrary to law 
ms hicks representatives of consumer groups and some plaintiff 
lawyers linked to dalkon shield lawsuits and robins reorganization 
called for rejection of the plan which was mailed to claimants 
last week 
the proposal includes robins merger with new yorkbased 
american home products corp and a dalkon shield trust fund of at 
least 2475 billion 
puckett expressed puzzlement at the opposition 
our view is that we have a consensus of all the groups 
involved in the case he said the reason for that is this plan 
is fair 
us district judge robert r merhige jr of richmond who is 
overseeing robins chapter 11 reorganization in us bankruptcy 
court in december placed the 2475 billion value on an estimated 
195000 dalkon shield claims before the court 
it is important to remember that judge merhige has said that 
the dalkon shield trust fund represents more money than anyone ever 
thought would be available puckett said 
a letter mailed by the claimants committee to women who contend 
they were injured by the birth control device said that as a 
result of interest earnings the funds available under the plan to 
pay dalkon shield claims and expenses will exceed 2475 billion 
we recommend that you vote to accept the plan of 
reorganization 
the plan is not perfect the letter said however on 
balance the plan offers claimants the most money and the best 
terms that could be achieved without a long and uncertain legal 
fight 
this is an opportunity to receive compensation for your claim 
sooner and with greater certainty than if we were to continue the 
litigation the committees letter said 
robins a pharmaceutical manufacturer based in richmond sold 
the intrauterine device in the the early 1970s robins filed for 
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law in august 1985 as 
lawsuits mounted against the dalkon shield

postmaster general anthony m frank moved to 
put his stamp on the nations mail tuesday juggling postal service 
managers and turning his personal attention to technology and 
planning 
change is inevitable if we are to be successful the us 
postal service must anticipate change and manage it effectively 
frank told the opening session of the third conference on advanced 
technology 
postal managers from around the world convened at the session to 
see the latest in sorting and canceling machines lasers that read 
zip codes and even automated postal clerks 
frank who brought automated bank tellers to supermarkets and 
discount stores when he headed a california savings and loan 
association told the conference that he hopes to do the same for 
the postal system 
we plan to locate automated postal tellers in high traffic 
areas like shoping malls transportation stations and large office 
buildings he said 
earlier tuesday frank known for his handson management style 
as a banker before taking over leadership of the postal service on 
march 1 told the agencys board of governors that he is separating 
the finance and planning divisions 
he named richard j strasser as assistant postmaster general for 
planning and said strasser will report directly to him on projects 
for the development and improvement of the agency 
the postal service announced meanwhile that it suffered a loss 
of 635 million for the accounting period from dec 19 to march 11 
above the 586 million deficit it had predicted for that period 
higher postage rates intended to put the service back in the black 
took effect april 3 
at its meeting the board of governors also disclosed that it 
has rejected a proposal to offer a lower billpayer postage 
rate 
that idea had been suggested by the independent postal rate 
commission it proposed a discount for people using preprinted 
reply envelopes such as those for use paying bills which are 
addressed to a post office box 
such envelopes do save the postal service money primarily 
because they go to a box rather than having to be delivered to a 
customer the board said but the governors concluded that the 
billpayer rate would be unfair to others sending mail to post 
office boxes since they would still have to pay the full rate 
in other personnel moves frank broadened the postal services 
top management by naming two associate postmasters general to work 
with him and deputy postmaster general michael coughlin 
kenneth j hunter was promoted to associate for systems 
succeeding the late fletcher f acord who died earlier this year 
this includes responsibility for personnel marketing 
communications facilities and procurement 
edward e horgan jr who has been in charge of facilities was 
given the newly created position of associate postmaster general 
for international affairs 
horgan will launch the new job by coordinating the 1989 meeting 
of the universal postal union the international group that 
coordinates mail service between nations it will be the 
organizations first meeting in the united states in 92 years 
frank who succeeded preston r tisch as postal service chief 
announced that consumer advocate ann robinsons duties will be 
expanded to include measurement of postal performance 
in addition he named mitchell h gordon to head administrative 
services and gordon c morison as acting head of marketing and 
communications

grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower 
tuesday on the chicago board of trade in an seesaw session 
influenced by conflicting interpretations of longrange weather 
forecasts 
if we had closed 15 minutes earlier we would have closed 
higher said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter reynolds 
inc its just been back and forth all day long 
forecasts called for beneficial rains tuesday in missouri 
nebraska and extreme southwestern iowa and a good chance for rain 
wednesday in central and southern illinois those forecasts gave 
the markets their negative tone 
but sixto10 day forecasts called for dryness and belownormal 
temperatures in the east with wetter weather and abovenormal 
temperatures in the west 
traders had a hard time deciding whether the longrange 
forecasts implied better or worse growing conditions lespinasse 
said 
the weather is ambiguous and the market reflected that 
ambiguity today he said 
at the close wheat was cent to 3 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in may at 297 a bushel corn was unchanged 
to cent lower with may at 204 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 
1 cents lower with may at 157 a bushel soybeans were cent to 
3 cents lower with may at 689 a bushel

gillette co said tuesday that its shareholders 
narrowly rejected a bid by a group of new york investors to replace 
four company directors and seek a buyer for gillettes global 
personal care empire 
analysts said most of the support for gillette came from 
individual shareholders interested in retaining a stable investment 
and confused by the lack of definite sale plan by coniston 
a preliminary count of about 87 million shares voting in the 
proxy election indicate that the four gillette directors received 
52 percent support gillette said it said that tally exceeded the 
48 percent of shareholder votes backing coniston groups slate of 
directors for the threeyear terms 
the announcement culminates a proxy battle launched in february 
by new yorkbased coniston which pledged to convince the other 
eight directors to sell gillette if its candidates were elected to 
the board possible suitors included revlon group inc which ended 
a series of takeover attempts in 1986 after gillette paid about 
580 million to repurchase its shares 
the proxy ballots were submitted during gillettes april 21 
annual meeting in andover mass 
after the ballots were cast both sides had claimed victory with 
coniston noting support from many large institutional shareholders 
coniston principal augustus k oliver vowed tuesday to 
immediately file a recount request saying their ballot projections 
were higher 
we submitted a lot more votes than we seem to be getting 
credit for said oliver it puzzles us and well try to figure 
out exactly how many people were on our side 
oliver also said coniston attorneys may request a new election 
as part of the equitable relief sought in a countersuit filed 
last month in us district court claiming gillette issued false 
and misleading statements about coniston during the threemonth 
proxy battle 
a pretrial hearing is scheduled wednesday before judge rya 
zobel who previously refused to issue a temporary restraining 
order to block conistons proxy slate 
in a suit filed last month gillette claims coniston failed to 
fully disclose all its financial backers in documents submitted to 
the us securities and exchange commission 
in a prepared statement tuesday gillette chairman colman m 
mockler jr said the outcome shows shareholder support for 
gillettes performance since a 1986 restructuring which included 
2400 layoffs and sale of several unprofitable divisions 
at the annual meeting several shareholders lauded gillette 
managements longterm plans and questioned conistons ultimate 
intentions 
coniston never really had any definite plan on the table 
said pavlos alexandrakis an analyst at argus research in new york 
there were no real buyers and no tender offer made all they were 
saying is that well have four people on a 12member board and 
well have some clout 
mary ann winter an analyst at brown brothers harriman in new 
york said most shareholders are reluctant to give up their 
investment in gillette which produces steady stock dividends 
heres a company with an annual growth rate of about 10 
percent and stockholders do not want to give that up for a onetime 
cash payment said winter institutional investors on the 
other hand are looking for a profit each quarter 
coniston a diversified investment firm controls 676 million 
gillette shares or about 58 percent of the companys 1155 
million shares outstanding 
last year coniston forced a major restructuring of allegis 
corp following a takeover attempt 
gillette spokeswoman joan fitzgerald said the company has no 
comment on reports that officials had conducted negotiations with 
several potential buyers 
as a way to dilute the influence of conistons slate gillette 
on april 20 amended its bylaws to increase the number of directors 
needed to call a special meeting from two to seven

trading halted for more than 2 hours tuesday on 
the chicago mercantile exchange after water from a burst pipe 
flooded the exchanges telecommunications room disabling its 
automated price quotation system 
the chicago mercantile exchange is the leading us market for 
stockindex and livestock futures and the trading shutdown had a 
quieting effect on the nations other financial markets analysts 
said 
we dont know what caused it but it leaked a whole lot of 
water exchange spokesman andrew yemma said after trading resumed 
at 1045 am cdt 
exchange officials called the trading halt at 805 am cdt 45 
minutes after the opening of trading in foreign currency and 
treasury bill futures trading in stockindex and agricultural 
futures had not yet opened when the halt was called yemma said 
a large water pipe in the sprinkler system burst and flooded the 
secondfloor telecommunications room located just below the 
exchanges trading floor he said 
the water disabled the exchanges highspeed telephone lines 
which carry price quotes to subscribers of marketinformation 
services around the world 
the exchanges computers were not damaged so trading could have 
continued but the customers and users of the market wouldnt have 
known what the prices were yemma said 
during the trading halt stock market players were unable to 
hedge their equity investments via the chicago mercantile 
exchanges popular standard amp poors 500 futures contract that may 
have limited trading activity on the new york stock exchange 
analysts said 
youre definitely not going to see anybody make a big play 
without the futures open said arthur liming an analyst with lns 
financial group in chicago 
while the merc was down he said there was one or two things 
less to watch on what was a quiet day to begin with 
yemma said it was impossible to calculate the dollar value of 
the loss of volume at the chicago mercantile exchange 
chicagos midamerica commodity exchange which trades smaller 
versions of the most popular futures contracts offered by other 
exchanges may have benefited from the mercs problems however 
spokesman william murschel said the midam halted trading in its 
stockindex livestock foreign currency and treasury bill futures 
at the same time as the mercantile exchange then resumed trading 
in those contracts at 10 am cdt when it appeared the merc might 
be closed for a day or more 
when the midam reopened it really became the marketplace for 
those contracts that were affected by the cme so there was an 
alternative marketplace available murschel said it was the 
midams day in the sun

the stock market advanced today but most of its 
gains were concentrated in bluechip takeover targets and in 
dividendrelated trading 
analysts said that aside from pockets of activity trading was a 
bit lackluster but they noted the markets improvement was more 
apparent than in previous weeks 
much of the sessions activity centered on heavy trading in 
american electric power which goes exdividend today 
takeover stocks also helped drive the market higher analysts 
said these issues heated up in anticipation that cash will soon be 
freed up as a handful of other takeover deals come to a close 
program traders were shut out of the market in the early going 
because of a water main break at the chicago mercantile exchange 
where the futures on the standard amp poors 500 index are traded 
activity was halted for more than two and a half hours 
some analysts welcomed the respite on wall street its a 
refreshing case of a stock market rather than a casino metz said 
arbitragers remained mostly on the sidelines once futures

eastman kodak cos earnings rose 46 
percent in the first quarter of 1988 to 260 million from 178 
million a year ago the company said tuesday 
the photographic giant said the increase was due to increases in 
sales volume the weak dollar and earnings from sterling drug 
inc which kodak acquired in february 
on a per share basis kodak earned 80 cents in the first three 
months of the year compared to 53 cents during the first quarter 
of 1987 
sales increased 25 percent to 333 billion from 265 billion 
last year 
analysts said the results were better than expected 
the only surprise in the report was a 2 percent earnings drop in 
the companys imaging segment which includes photography and 
copiers according to charles ryan of merrill lynch amp co in new 
york 
ryan said the decline was due to repackaging of certain film 
products and increased advertising expenses 
he said however the expenditures would pay off later 
another analyst eugene glazer of dean witter reynolds inc in 
new york said a large portion of the per share earnings increase 
27 cents was due to the declining value of the dollar which makes 
foreign profits worth more in dollar terms 
glazer said it was a low quality source of earnings gain 
he said the sale of assets in france resulted in another 4 cents 
of the pershare gain 
both analysts noted strong gains in the companys chemicals 
segment and the sterling drug subsidiary 
sales rose in each of kodaks three segments sales in its 
imaging segment were 2 billion up from 18 billion last year 
chemical sales were 654 million up from 588 million and sales 
in health products were 640 million up from 274 million 
sales outside the united states were healthy up 23 percent in 
the imaging segment up 16 percent in chemicals and up 104 percent

a federal jury acquitted an oklahoma oil 
contractor tuesday on charges of scheming to defraud continental 
illinois national bank amp trust co but failed to reach a verdict 
on two bank executives charged in the case 
us district judge milton shadur declared a mistrial after 
jurors said they were hopelessly deadlocked 
the government maintained during the 6week trial that former 
banker william patterson manipulated his two debtplagued 
codefendants john lytle and jere sturgis in a scheme involving 
highrisk energy loans to save his own failing bank by defrauding 
continental 
but the panel found sturgis an independent oil contractor from 
tulsa okla innocent of wirefraud charges patterson and lytle 
were charged with wire fraud and misapplication of funds 
continental came to the brink of collapse in 1984 in part 
because of troubled energy loans but the chicago bank survived 
with help from a 45 billion federal rescue plan 
what can i say the dream came true sturgis said after the 
innocent verdict was read im getting on the first plane back 
to oklahoma 
lytle a former continental vice president who headed the 
chicago banks energylending division said i am very 
disappointed about the mistrial i had hoped for a resolution 
outside the courtroom neither patterson a vice president at 
penn square bank in oklahoma city until its collapse in 1982 nor 
his lawyer warren bickford had anything to say to reporters 
but in oklahoma city another patterson attorney burck bailey 
said he also was disappointed we were hopeful that the jury 
would return a verdict of not guilty but of course were pleased 
on the other hand that there was no guilty verdict returned 
bailey said 
us attorney anton valukas said he would huddle for a few days 
with assistant prosecutors joseph duffy and mark rotert before 
deciding whether to seek another trial 
when the jury speaks we respect the verdict valukas said 
we sent up the best trial lawyers to try an extraordinarily 
complex case they did a good job 
james streiker lytles attorney said theres a good 
possibility there will be a retrial 
the case went to the jury april 26 and jurors began their fifth 
day of deliberations shortly after 9 am edt tuesday 
federal prosecutors had contended patterson was the central 
figure in the alleged fraud scheme and controlled lytle and 
sturgis who were financially dependent on him and penn square for 
loans 
the government charged that lytle caught in spiraling personal 
debt to finance a luxurious lifestyle accepted kickbacks from 
patterson in exchange for funding or attempting to fund highrisk 
energy loans from continental for penn square customers between 
july 1981 and july 1982 
the indictment cited lytles involvement in 44 million in loans 
made by continental to 12 penn square customers many without any 
documentation it did not say how much eventually was recovered by 
the chicago bank 
attorneys for lytle and patterson had argued that continental 
was saddled with the troublesome energy loans because of an 
aggressive lending policy not because of a fraud scheme 
lytle and sturgis were accused of engaging in a related 
buyback investment scheme that began with lytle buying into 
sturgis operations in may 1981 
sturgis bought lytle out less than a year later at triple the 
original investment to improve his chances of getting a continental 
loan through the chicago banker prosecutors said 
patterson arranged for a 3 million loan to sturgis from penn 
square that enabled him to buy out lytles 150000 investment for 
475000 the government said 
the buyback scheme was devised as a way for lytle to clear 
much of his personal debt and for sturgis who was then being 
pursued by creditors over 100 million in business loans to find a 
new lending source prosecutors said in closing arguments

gold futures prices dipped to their lowest levels in more than 
six weeks tuesday bolstering bearish projections and prompting 
speculation that the metals price could tumble as low as 400 a 
troy ounce in coming months 
on other markets energy futures rallied cattle futures climbed 
while pork futures were mixed grains and soybeans were lower and 
stockindex futures advanced 
it was not the depth of golds decline but the fact that it fell 
at all that analysts found remarkable oil prices rallied tuesday 
and inflationsensitive gold would ordinarily have done the same 
ive been saying gold is in a bear market and todays action 
certainly proves it said peter cardillo commodity trading 
adviser with joesphthal amp co in new york we could have had an 
up day with the price of oil rebounding but the market just 
ignored that and traded on its own 
gold settled 210 lower across the board on new yorks 
commodity exchange with the contract for delivery in june at 
44510 a troy ounce the lowest price for a lead futures contract 
since march 17 when the april contract settled at 44490 
the overall strength of the economy and the fading prospects for 
higher inflation have the precious metals markets on the defensive 
analysts said 
craig sloane an analyst with smith barney harris upham amp co 
called tuesdays trading another small disaster for both gold 
and silver futures 
this is sort of a continuation of what has been a steady 
erosion over the last couple of months in both of these markets 
he said 
silver settled 5 cents to 55 cents lower with may at 6298 a 
troy ounce 
energy futures advanced on the new york mercantile exchange in a 
technical recovery from mondays plunge which had been a reaction 
to the failure of opec oil ministers to agree on production cuts 
analysts said 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 23 cents to 26 cents 
higher with june at 1737 a barrel heating oil was 09 cent lower 
to 82 cent higher with june at 4677 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 75 cent to 91 cent higher with june at 5028 cents a 
gallon 
cattle futures rose sharply on the chicago mercantile exchange 
while pork futures were mixed 
the cattle market is struggling between the reality of high cash 
prices and the implication of recent government reports that large 
numbers of cattle are being fattened for slaughter said chuck 
levitt an analyst in chicago with shearson lehman hutton inc 
hog futures were caught tuesday between the higher cattle 
futures prices and sharply lower porkbelly futures linked to a 
glut of frozen bellies levitt said 
the opening of livestock trading on the chicago mercantile 
exchange was delayed about 2 hours tuesday when water from a burst 
pipe flooded the exchanges telecommunications room forcing a halt 
to trading 
live cattle settled 43 cent to 92 cent higher with june at 
7157 cents a pound feeder cattle were 20 cent to 93 cent higher 
with may at 7945 cents a pound hogs were 05 cent lower to 33 
cent higher with june at 4950 cents a pound frozen pork bellies 
were unchanged to 85 cent lower with may at 5125 cents a pound 
grain and soybean futures finished lower on the chicago board of 
trade in an upanddown session influenced by conflicting 
interpretations of longrange weather forecasts analysts said 
forecasts called for beneficial rains tuesday in missouri 
nebraska and extreme southwestern iowa and a good chance for rain 
wednesday in central and southern illinois those forecasts gave 
the markets their negative tone 
but sixto10 day forecasts called for dryness and belownormal 
temperatures in the east with wetter weather and abovenormal 
temperatures in the west 
traders had a hard time deciding whether the longrange 
forecasts implied better or worse growing conditions said victor 
lespinasse a trader with dean witter reynolds inc 
wheat settled cent to 4 cents lower with may at 297 a 
bushel corn was unchanged to cent lower with may at 204 a 
bushel oats were 1 cents to 1 cents lower with may at 157 a 
bushel soybeans were cent to 2 cents lower with may at 689 a 
bushel 
stockindex futures advanced on the chicago mercantile exchange

koppers co accused shearson lehman hutton 
inc on tuesday of improperly trading koppers stock on the basis of 
inside information about the 17 billion hostile takeover attempt 
by shearson and british industrialist brian beazer 
a court document filed by koppers attorneys said shearson 
brokers accumulated koppers stock from january through early march 
for managed discretionary customer accounts 
during the same period which ended the day before the beazer 
group announced a buyout offer large amounts of koppers stock were 
sold for shearson discretionary accounts and for discretionary and 
managed discretionary accounts of shearsons ef hutton unit 
based on information disclosed shearsons managed accounts 
performed as if they had a pipeline directly into the tender 
offer the attorneys said in court documents filed in us 
district court in pittsburgh 
it is factually obvious that shearsons preferential customers 
were enriched at the expense of all other discretionary accounts 
the documents stated 
the allegations were included in a motion filed in connection 
with koppers federal suit to block the beazer groups takeover 
attempt 
bns inc formed by beazer shearson and national westminster 
bank has offered 60 a share to acquire the pittsburghbased 
chemical and construction company 
the investor group owns or has been tendered about 66 percent of 
koppers outstanding common shares but is barred from purchasing 
the tendered stock by two injunctions issued by federal judges in 
pittsburgh and los angeles

eastern airlines has asked a federal judge to 
clarify his order barring the financially troubled carrier from 
selling its northeast shuttle service to another subsidiary of its 
parent texas air corp 
meanwhile the federal aviation administration is investigating 
machinist union charges that the miamibased carrier is guessing 
the weight of cargo aboard its aircraft 
weve been looking into the allegations for about a week and a 
half faa spokesman roger myers said tuesday we have not found 
any irregularities yet 
the faa has already fined eastern 823500 for safety violations 
and is conducting an inspection of its fleet 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the airline is absolutely 
safe in all phases of its operations and accused the machinists 
of using safety issues as a smokescreen to obscure economic issues 
in contract negotiations 
in washington the motion by eastern which was filed last week 
under seal in us district court appears to have been made in an 
attempt to ensure that a planned business transaction would not 
violate a series of orders issued by district judge john h pratt 
in march pratt held eastern in contempt of a july 2 1987 
order issued in a labor dispute for taking steps to sell the 
eastern air shuttle to a newly created subsidiary of texas air 
corp for 225 million the service operates between new york and 
washington and new york and boston 
pratt barred eastern from taking any further steps to sell the 
shuttle ruling the transaction would violate the status quo in 
working conditions he had ordered last summer 
the proposed sale was opposed by the machinists union which 
charged the company was trying to undermine the unions ability to 
represent shuttle employees by transferring the operation to 
another subsidiary 
matell refused to comment tuesday on why the airlines filed the 
motion saying only the entire letter is under seal and we do 
not care to clarify 
court documents requesting that the clarification motion be 
placed under seal said eastern was trying to protect confidential 
and proprietary information about its business plans 
eastern would be placed at a serious and irreparable 
competitive disadvantage if the information contained in the motion 
and memorandum and supporting affidavits is made public the 
companys deputy general counsel michael j smith said in a sworn 
affidavit 
disclosure of the information could impair easterns ability 
to manage its operations and to resolve its financial 
difficulties 
in a reply to easterns request attorneys for the machinists 
said the union did not agree with the airlines interpretation of 
pratts order 
the us circuit court of appeals here is scheduled to hear 
arguments thursday on easterns appeal of pratts order barring the 
shuttle sale
