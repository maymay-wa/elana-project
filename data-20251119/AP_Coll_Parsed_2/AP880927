president reagan told the united nations 
in a farewell speech monday that this was a moment of hope for 
peace in the world and that a new ussoviet treaty to sharply 
reduce nuclear arms may be concluded next year 
he called for an international war on drug traffickers 
terrorism and hostagetaking and vowed to maintain us support 
for an armed insurgency against the leftist government of nicaragua 
he said the sandinistas were pursuing the oldest most corrupt 
vice of all mans ageold will to power his lust to control the 
lives and steal the freedoms of others 
but with his presidency nearing an end reagan struck a mostly 
philosophical stance as he told the 43rd general assembly session 
of 159 nations that civil wars and foreign occupations were giving 
way around the world 
reagan said the trend was spurred by a new era in 
sovietamerican relations marked by the continuing withdrawal of 
the red army from afghanistan and a treaty last year to abolish 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
he said us and soviet negotiators were making steady progress 
on another accord to sharply reduce longrange bombers missiles 
and submarines while completion of the pact this year was highly 
doubtful reagan said i can tell you a year from now it is a 
possibility more than a possibility 
on the conventional front reagan said eastwest talks to reduce 
nonnuclear forces tanks and other mobile weapons in europe will 
begin soon 
the united states had demanded a soviet commitment to give equal 
attention to human rights reagan met last week in washington with 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
afterward us officials said the soviets had promised to 
release 27 additional political prisoners to make changes in their 
emigration procedures and to undertake other reforms reagans 
statement indicated the human rights obstacle had been removed 
after the speech reagan met with foreign ministers esmat abdel 
meguid of egypt and shimon peres of israel on prospects for peace 
in the middle east 
chatting with reporters during a picturetaking session reagan 
said he had high hopes for release of the nine american 
hostages held in lebanon by proiranian forces 
but im superstitious about calling a nohitter before the 
game is over reagan said 
the former baseball broadcaster appeared to be referring to the 
progressive release of french and west german hostages and being 
reluctant to talk about it for fear of upsetting the situation 
but marlin fitzwater the white house spokesman said there is 
no morsel of information that gives us reason to be more hopeful 
in the session with meguid and peres the president called the 
1979 peace treaty between their countries a monumental 
achievement which has changed the face of the region 
he said the us goal was to move beyond it to an overall 
settlement that took into account the legitimate rights of 
palestinian arabs 
according to israeli sources who declined to be further 
identified peres said that his government would not deal with 
arafat and the palestine ration organization so long as they were 
involved in terrorism and violence and speak of trying to force 
israel back to the partition lines set by the united nations in 
1947 
secretary of state george shultz meanwhile said despite 
elections in the united states and israel in november the parties 
should keep working for negotiations since a vacuum is very 
dangerous 
in other developments on a busy day in new york reagan 
met twice with un secretary general javier perez de cuellar 
to assess prospects of ending the persian gulf war it was reagans 
first meeting with perez de cuellar since the white houses 
announcement on sept 13 that the president was releasing 188 
million the united states had withheld from the organization to 
show displeasure with un budgetary and hiring practices 
scheduled a meeting with prince norodom sihanouk the former 
ruler of cambodia in washington on oct 11 the purpose is to 
underscore us support for his forces as they compete with the 
khmer rouge to take control of the country from provietnam 
authorities 
met with president robert mugabe of zimbabwe to register us 
resolve for successful completion of negotiations that 
simultaneously would withdraw cuban troops from angola and south 
africa from namibia 
met with leaders of persian gulf countries after deciding to 
end the us military convoy of usflagged kuwaiti oil tankers 
us officials stressed american warships would remain in the gulf 
prepared to come to the aid of commercial ships under attack 
the presidents speech was the most upbeat of the seven speeches 
he has made before the world body 
from angola to cambodia and in the persian gulf where perez de 
cuellar is trying to formalize a ceasefire to end the eightyear 
war between iran and iraq prospects for peace are bright reagan 
said 
fitzwater said earlier monday that reagan had decided to end the 
14month program of providing us navy escorts to reflagged 
kuwaiti oil tankers in the persian gulf but he still would 
maintain a naval presence there to aid threatened ships 
fitzwater told reporters that reagan acted after reviewing the 
current ceasefire which has been in effect since august 20 
and consulting with allies and friends in the region 
in his speech reagan said i stand at this podium then in a 
moment of hope hope not just for the peoples of the united states 
or the soviet union but for all the peoples of the world 
in arms control he said the logjam is broken by the ban on 
us and soviet intermediaterange missiles progress toward a 
strategic arms reduction treaty and the onset of negotiations 
between the north atlantic treaty organization and the warsaw pact 
on conventional forces 
history teaches caution reagan said but his speech was 
upbeat and he traced the improvement in ussoviet relations to 
the first summit meeting he had held with soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev in geneva nearly three years ago 
so if future generations do say of us that in our time peace 
came closer that we did bring about new seasons of truth and 
justice it will be cause for pride reagan said

aviation safety is improving and 
technology and training programs are now in place to prevent most 
major air disasters the director of the federal aviation 
administration said monday 
i reject any notion from anybody that would assert that 
aviation safety is somehow declining allan mcartor said during a 
visit to the mike monroney aeronautical center in oklahoma city 
nearcollision reports are down 67 percent from last year pilot 
errors are down 63 percent and controller errors are down 18 
percent mcartor said 
also down are aviationrelated fatalities and delays he said 
aviation safety is improving that does not mean aviation 
safety cannot continue to improve we have a lot of work to do but 
we should never be caught in the trap of assuming that accident 
rates reflect aviation safety he said explaining that as air 
travel increases the number of accidents also would increase 
technological advancements in such things as radar combined 
with improved pilot training programs have reduced the danger of 
wind shear to air travelers mcartor said 
wind shear has been with us since the dawn of aviation but 
just now we have the technology and the training that can 
recognize these microburst conditions he said 
he referred to sudden shifts in wind direction and speed caused 
when a mass of cooled air rushes downward out of a thunderstorm a 
condition that can especially endanger planes taking off and 
landing 
just last week the faa announced that airplanes themselves will 
now be required to carry equipment that can detect wind shear and 
to display steering commands so pilots can escape the conditions 
mcartor said 
in addition he said all airlines are now training pilots in 
simulators to recognize conditions of wind shear and to escape from 
them safely 
he said the 1985 crash of a delta airlines flight in dallas that 
killed 137 people probably could have been prevented if such 
measures had been in place at the time

a neighborhood trying to buck bureaucracy 
middlemen and rising inflation has created chinas first consumer 
food cooperative in 30 years 
the tiantan residential area consumer cooperative in beijing 
opened in april and already has 9000 members who paid 5 yuan 
130 a share for access to fresh and sometimes cheaper 
vegetables milk eggs matches food oils and other consumer goods 
our only purpose is to serve the people said the coops 
general manager yang jingson 
it is run entirely by people living near the landmark temple of 
heaven in southern beijing 
consumer cooperatives existed in the early years after the 
communist government came to power in 1949 but were taken over by 
the state in 1957 when our economy became more developed yang 
said 
the idea has been revived three decades later as china goes 
through the painful process of ending price controls and letting 
the value of most food products be determined by market forces 
prices for many vegetables and other food items have doubled in 
the past year amid an overall inflation rate of around 20 percent 
the reluctance of farmers to grow lowprofit crops difficulties in 
transport and widespread profiteering in scarce commodities have 
added to the price spiral the most serious problem facing the 
chinese economy today 
the tiantan neighborhood committee decided to start the coop 
yang said mainly to eliminate all kinds of troubles happening 
between producers and consumers 
the cooperative has signed contracts with several farm villages 
outside beijing for supply and delivery of cucumbers milk sesame 
oil and other items which are stocked in some of the 40 shops now 
run by the cooperative 
most of the 100 people working for the cooperative are retired 
from regular jobs or unemployed yang said 
zhang xuyuan 69 said she came out of retirement to run a 
little corner shop that sells soft drinks canned goods and fresh 
foods because i wanted something to do 
now she says she works up to 12 hours a day and takes home a 
wage pegged to the shops sales and averaging about 100 yuan 27 
a month on a par with a factory workers salary 
shoppers she said are quite satisfied theyve got no 
quarrels with the cooperative products 
yang said the little groceries barely break even but the 
cooperative is earning good profits from several larger retail 
stores 
he said shareholders should receive dividends larger than 
interest rates on bank savings deposits 
he added that as china switches to a commoditybased economy 
the government permits consumers to have various shopping options 
the coop he said will be a little brother to stateowned 
food shops and will not hurt the free markets that now supply urban 
residents with much of their betterquality if more expensive food 
although elimination of middlemen will mean better prices for 
coop members yang said prices will generally be pegged to those 
in state stores but that holding the line on price rises will be 
tough 
he expressed confidence however that the coop could provide 
good service at reasonable prices and make things a little 
easier for our residents

president pw botha completes 
10 years in power wednesday pressing ahead with policies that have 
disenchanted blacks and whites across south africas political 
spectrum 
not interested in charming his way to popularity botha has 
presented himself as a stern dedicated patriot leading his country 
on a precarious path between outright racism and black majority 
rule 
lately his balancing act has won little praise growing numbers 
of rightwing whites feel he has gone too far in extending power to 
blacks while white liberals and a solid core of blacks believe he 
has fallen woefully short 
the criticisms and increasingly frequent calls for new 
leadership sometimes rankle botha but he is unapologetic 
my attitude is that i am doing what i believe to be right and 
in the interests of the country he recently told a television 
interviewer who sought an assessment of 10 turbulent years 
in his early years in power botha had a broad mandate from 
whites for his twin goals of maintaining stability while moving 
away from rigid apartheid 
the sunday times south africas largest newspaper and a critic 
of the government commented this month mr bothas place in 
history is assured it required courage to lead his people out of 
the culdesac of apartheid even if the final destination of their 
new course remains uncharted 
botha 72 became head of the whiteminority government on sept 
28 1978 when parliament members elected him prime minister over 
more moderate and more conservative rivals 
he had been in the cabinet since 1961 and became defense 
minister in 1966 his first speech as prime minister stressed a 
theme that remains dear to him the paramount importance of 
national security in the face of a purported communistled total 
onslaught 
a year later in one of his most quoted remarks he sounded a 
different theme telling whites we must adapt otherwise we will 
die 
in 1984 botha helped push through a new constitution that 
brought asians and people of mixed race into the previously 
allwhite parliament but continued to exclude blacks one result 
was black anger that ignited two years of nationwide political 
violence 
the constitution abolished the post of prime minister and botha 
became president his critics say he has steadily increased the 
power of the executive branch since then while weakening parliament 
since 1984 botha has been credited with the repeal of several 
of apartheids most hurtful laws including those that banned 
interracial marriages and required blacks to have a permit to be in 
whitesonly areas 
these reforms along with promises of limited powersharing with 
blacks triggered a wave of defections by bothas fellow afrikaners 
from the national party to the extremeright conservative party 
bothas anniversary comes as the national party verges on losing 
support of a majority of whites for the first time since it gained 
power 40 years ago 
the party won 55 percent of the vote in whitesonly general 
elections in may 1987 while 26 percent went to the conservative 
party and 19 percent to liberal candidates 
the conservatives are believed to have gained strength since 
then and could outpoll the national party in nationwide local 
elections oct 26 
many liberals believe botha has gone as far as he is willing to 
go toward substantive reform the president has declared that some 
aspects of apartheid are nonnegotiable he rejects equal voting 
rights for blacks and insists that whites retain segregated 
neighborhoods and schools 
we are forever told that president bothas government has 
chosen the path fo reform and should be given a chance wrote 
black newspaper editor khulu sibiya what chance when they move 
one step forward and three backwards 
botha whose government has detained thousands of black 
activists during a 27monthold state of emergency says most 
blacks view him favorably 
opinion polls suggest otherwise 
this month botha held his first summit meetings in black 
africa he visited malawi a longtime friend of south africa and 
mozambique a longtime adversary 
some critics say botha is more willing to take chances in the 
international arena than at home 
one has to say that pw botha lacks imagination said peter 
soal parliament member for the antiapartheid progressive federal 
party he has failed to deal creatively with black political 
aspirations 
even some of bothas own cabinet ministers feel he should step 
down said soal is there someone with the guts to tell him

ne win who resigned two months ago 
after 26 years of despotic rule is widely believed to still be the 
top man in burma orchestrating moves to put down the 
antigovernment uprising 
many western diplomats and burmese believe ne win has been 
calling the shots since he stepped down july 23 as chairman of the 
burma socialist program party that has ruled the country for a 
quarter century 
i would say the almost universal perception and opinion among 
burmese is that ne win is still the government of burma a 
rangoonbased diplomat said 
ne win 77 has remained out of public sight since he resigned 
and there is no indisputable evidence he remains the most powerful 
figure 
but observers characterize the men who have led the government 
since he stepped down as longtime associates of ne win who dare 
not make any major move without his assent 
diplomats said military commander gen saw maung visited ne win 
at his home in the plush northern rangoon suburbs around scenic 
inya lake before launching a coup sept 18 that began a harsh 
crackdown on prodemocracy protesters 
the rangoonbased diplomat said a number of other meetings 
have been held at critical times between ne win and top officials 
sein lwin who became head of the party and state to succeed ne 
win in july was a military leader known for his ruthlessness and 
longtime political association with ne win 
when protests against sein lwins authoritarian rule increased 
in august he was replaced by civilian maung maung who served as 
ne wins legal adviser and wrote a flattering book about him called 
burma and general ne win 
tzang yawnghwe an author and son of burmas first president 
described maung maung as one of the few burmese intellectuals who 
sincerely and deeply admired gen ne win 
maung maung was removed from power by saw maung when promises to 
hold the first multiparty elections since 1960 failed to end 
massive antigovernment street demonstrations and a crippling 
general strike 
saw maung who was promoted to armed forces commander in 1985 
is regarded as a hardliner who during most of his 39year army 
career has loyally followed orders from ne win 
ne win didnt raise up a generation of leaders but raised a 
generation of followers to do his bidding a bangkokbased 
diplomat observed 
another diplomat said the three successors are generally viewed 
as absolutely beholden to the charismatic ne win whose 
unquestioned supremacy over the capable wellorganized 186000man 
military since his 1962 coup is seen as the key to his lasting 
power 
the opposition so far has been unable to draw into its fold the 
rankandfile soldiers and their officers who in the past week 
shot and killed largely unarmed peaceful demonstrators and broke 
up dozens of protest centers throughout the nation 
what striking about it is the ruthlessness of his ne wins 
tactics the bangkokbased diplomat said 
japanese burma expert minoru kiryu suggests however that 
events of recent weeks do not follow a ne win scenario since 
the coup leaders abolished virtually all the state organizations 
built up by the military strongman 
ne win first came to prominence as one of burmas thirty 
comrades who played a key role in the fight for independence from 
britain he ended burmas shaky postindependence experiment with 
democracy by leading the 1962 coup 
ne win quickly vowed to lead his country on a neutralist 
egalitarian and moralistic burmese road to socialism 
but inefficiency corruption and black marketeering soon spread 
throughout the system and burma rich in natural resources and once 
the worlds largest exporter of rice is now one of the worlds 
poorest nations 
the failure to oust ne win and his cronies despite the popular 
uprising has led to certainly a tremendous mood of depression and 
disillusionment in the country the rangoonbased diplomat said

an illusion has been dashed for william 
proxmire who won his last senate election in wisconsin by shaking 
scores of thousands of hands and spending 145 
proxmire a member of the senate since 1957 won that election 
in 1982 with 64 percent of the vote and without spending a dime on 
television commercials 
but in the scramble to succeed him a scuffle that began when 
he announced earlier this year that he would not seek reelection 
a new reality of the american political process emerged 
proxmire has found that money does in fact talk 
the senator predicted the result earlier this year even before 
wisconsins voters picked freespending millionaire businessman 
herb kohl who never has held public office as the democratic 
senatorial nominee over a list of veteran politicians 
proxmire described to the senate the way he had established a 
victorious and enduring political career by shaking hands and 
ringing doorbells he also correctly described what can happen when 
all that hard work comes up against big money 
meet just as many voters as you can day after day month 
after month year after year proxmire said in a senate speech 
the numbers are critical he said they add up you can 
literally meet hundreds every day by campaigning on main streets 
and shopping malls for seven or eight hours a day you can hit a 
couple of thousand 
go out to baseball and football games state fairs busy 
summer festivals and you can meet as many as a thousand an hour 
literally 
keep that up year after year and you build remarkable 
longterm support he said when you run statewide a few times 
an astonishing number remember you many of the 
hundredthousand people you met in your 1952 campaign for governor 
still remember meeting you when they vote in 1982 
with every election that passes you have more of those 
beautiful voters in the bank 
it was a magic that never failed him 
but it was not a road that kohl a relatively unknown face 
chose to follow 
according to proxmire kohl got his name recognition with money 
not by meeting voters one after the other 
all that magic can blow away like a puff of smoke in a 
hurricane when your opponent turns up with 2 million or 3 million 
to buy television time and the good judgment of the experts to tell 
him precisely how to build on it he said 
kohls republican opponent susan engeleiter minority leader of 
the wisconsin state senate also is mounting an extensive and 
expensive television campaign but is expected to be outspent by 
kohl who had pumped 4 million into his campaign by the end of 
august 
proxmire said that as a result of kohls heavy spending in the 
democratic primary campaign the three democratic candidates 
qualified by years of service in public office and with long 
campaigning were left far behind in the dust 
proxmires conclusion building constituent support one on 
one serving well in public office can help build a political 
career but there is no substitute for money and lots of it 
wisely spent in buying the most seasoned and shrewd media advice 
and the television time to ring that bell 
the candidate who has come from nowhere has been a smashing 
success in business proxmire said he may if elected serve 
the country and our state as an excellent senator 
but as a retiring senator who followed the other painstaking 
route of years of onetoone hard campaigning work proxmire 
said i am disillusioned and more than a little jealous

the uss new jersey nearly ran down a 
yacht carrying antinuclear demonstrators as the battleship 
maneuvered into sydney harbor today through a flotilla of yachts 
canoes and surfboards 
the new jerseys skipper capt douglas katz said his 
57000ton battlewagon would probably have sunk the yacht had it 
had not been dragged clear at the last moment 
if it had not been for that police boat pulling it off wed 
have split it in half katz said the guy on that police boat 
was very brave 
the police boat managed to secure the yacht and tow it clear 
seconds before the battleship steamed by 
other protesters in assorted small craft attempted to get 
alongside the ship and plaster it with antinuclear slogans but 
were kept away by a cordon of police and australian navy speed 
boats 
police and navy divers jumped into the water to arrest two 
protesters 
katz 46 of bluefield w va said demonstrators some of them 
from the international environmental group greenpeace risked their 
lives coming so close to the new jersey because turbulence from the 
ships four 18foot propellors could have sucked them under water 
the new jersey is visiting australia with an international fleet 
of more than 40 warships to celebrate the bicentennial of european 
settlement of australia 
antinuclear demonstrators were protesting the new jerseys 
presence because it carries tomahawk cruise missiles the us navy 
refuses to confirm or deny whether the missiles carry nuclear 
warheads 
the new jersey built in 1943 is powered by oldfashioned 
oilfired steam engines it was followed into sydney harbor by the 
british aircraft carrier ark royal and four warships of the royal 
dutch navy

environmentalists hailed a call by the 
environmental protection agency for a global ban on 
ozonedestroying chloroflurocarbons and related compounds 
were glad to see theyve come around to our way of 
thinking said liz cook of friends of the earth 
the announcement monday by epa administrator lee m thomas 
marked a shift from his view that there was plenty of time to 
consider what if any steps were needed to tighten the terms of an 
existing international treaty on reducing cfc production 
that treaty signed by 45 major nations pledges signatories to 
a 50 percent cut by 1998 
the cfc compounds are widely used as refrigeration fluids 
solvents and foam blowing agents and outside the united states as 
aerosol propellants related bromine compounds are used in fire 
extinguishers some can last for more than a century rising to the 
stratosphere where they eventually break down to liberate chlorine 
a major study of ozone by the national aeronautics and space 
administration last march found ozone depletion of as much as 3 
percent at midlatitudes and attributed it to chlorine 
without cutting off production of cfcs chlorine and bromine 
will continue to build up in the atmosphere destroying 
highaltitude ozone that protects the earth from the suns 
ultraviolet rays the epa said in a new analysis released monday 
it is increasingly clear that we as a global environmental 
community must use the treaty to go even further to eliminate 
these chemicals which damage the stratospheric ozone layer and 
threaten our future thomas said in a statement 
regretfully our new analysis predicts an even worse scenario 
than anticipated he added 
up to now thomas had resisted environmentalist recommendations 
for a cfcphaseout in his remarks monday thomas mentioned no 
specific timetable for a phase out 
david doniger of the natural resources defense council an 
environmentalist group said the epa announcement underlines the 
seriousness of the emergency we are facing 
doniger predicted the report would have a lot of impact on 
major cfc producers abroad 
also on monday the major trade association of cfc makers and 
users the alliance for a responsible cfc policy announced it 
too now believed the nations of the world should aim at phasing 
out cfcs to the maximum extent feasible 
kevin fay executive director of the usersproducers group said 
the phasing out approach probably would mean some cfcs would 
continue to be in use into the 21st century 
we will be working with other trade groups around the world 
trying to line up support for a phaseout of cdc production and 
use fay said 
environmentalist groups have suggested 1995 as a target date for 
ending cfc production 
john hoffman coauthor of the epa analysis said the failure of 
computer models to predict past ozone depletion leads epa to shy 
away from ozone predictions and to zero in on chlorine buildup 
instead any increases in chlorine raise the risk of ozone 
depletion he said 
currently epa estimates worldwide atmospheric chlorine at 27 
parts per billion others last year put the figure at 3 parts per 
billion which represents about a 25 percent increase in the past 
decade by some estimates half the total comes from natural 
sources such as sea spray 
in the past epa has said an immediate 85 percent reduction in 
the major cfc compounds would be needed to keep chlorine from 
rising 
but those estimates did not include noncfc chemicals that yield 
chlorine notably methyl chloroform the most widely used 
industrial solvent if use of that compound continues to grow the 
current level of chlorine in the atmosphere would triple by 2075 
the epa said even if the growth of methyl chloroform use was 
halted the level of chlorine in the atmosphere would double by 
2075 it said 
an immediate 100 percent reduction in the use of all of the 
most powerful compounds and a freeze in methyl chloroform would be 
needed by all countries to stabilize chlorine epa said by 
immediate it said it meant 1990 
this would permit use of less powerful cfc compounds to grow 
throughout the next century while still holding the chlorine 
increase to less than 1 part per billion by 2100

theres a whiff of fire and 
brimstone in the outer hebrides these days as the islanders of 
lewis and harris prepare to defend their sabbath against a ferry 
invasion from the scottish mainland 
life is rugged in these treeless windswept peatlands and 
sunday is the high point of a week otherwise spent fishing tending 
sheep and weaving harris tweed pubs and playgrounds close on 
sundays flights are suspended tv and newspapers are shunned and 
the only travel is to church 
thus to these flinty presbyterians the decision by the 
caledonian macbrayne ferry company to begin sunday sailings next 
summer is a threat to civilization as they know it they see 
tourists and trucks shattering the sabbath peace 
the company has sought to allay these fears by modifying its 
itinerary so that ferries will sail out but not in but the 
islanders say hebridean harbor staff will still be forced to go to 
work instead of to church 
the people of these islands value their principles their 
sunday their way of life and we are determined to protect these 
to the bitter end says john murdo morrison a hotelier in 
tarbert where the ferry is to dock 
but other forces are at work calmac as the ferry company is 
known is to be privatized under prime minister margaret thatchers 
drive to sell off stateowned industries and it says that once 
exposed to market forces ferries cannot lie idle on sundays 
thus the thatcherite imperatives of free enterprise are bumping 
up against ancient traditions in what the sunday times in london 
calls britains deepest cultural battle 
donald mcleod a fisherman vows to lead a blockade of tarberts 
tiny harbor when sailings commence next summer and calmac which 
has served the hebrides for more than a century says it may ask 
the royal navy to step in 
calmac warns morrison is sailing into a horrendous hebridean 
hurricane 
denunciations have poured forth from the pulpits and the 
stornoway gazette and local advertiser is filled with angry letters 
sunday sailors will be cursed writes reader nm maclean 
while john macrae turns to verse the forces of evil are in 
battle array to destroy the sabbath wherever they may we would 
resolve as shadrach of old that we will not bow to their image of 
gold 
at a time when much of britain is jumping through hoops in the 
chase for tourists its refreshing to find a place that is 
actively fighting to keep them out 
sandy matheson head of the hebridean local authority concedes 
that some see us as cranky individuals but she believes the 
cause is just 
we have a day apart the mainland of britain has no day apart 
it suffers from the most appalling problems of urbanization 
antisocial behavior vandalism he said in an interview in his 
office in stornoway the hebridean capital 
now why on earth are we going to change by giving up our day 
apart which we deem to be so precious 
calmac director colin paterson says he understands the 
islanders sensitivities but believes that plenty of islanders 
want a sunday service and he sees nothing unchristian about using 
it 
peter mckibbin a retired stornoway businessman and lone voice 
in favor of sunday sailings says the opposition is confined to one 
segment of the archipelago the adjoining islands of lewis and 
harris 
on these islands the population of 22000 is solidly 
presbyterian further south on the uists benbecula and barra the 
9000 islanders are predominantly roman catholic sabbath rules are 
less stern and there have been few objections to sunday sailings 
calmacs compromise plan entails the ferry leaving tarbert on 
sunday for uig on the mainland and not returning to tarbert until 
monday 
but morrison says its the thin end of a wedge because once 
the principle is established sunday sailings into tarbert will 
follow 
paterson he says is an englishman who cannot understand the 
islanders preoccupations i was born in this village i was 
brought up in it and i intend to make sure that its not going to 
be eroded by sassenachs he said using the scottish pejorative 
for englishmen 
you must not become a slave to tourism he said because 
you lose your identity once that happens

no matter the care taken and the tests 
conducted eventually there will be another space accident and the 
marshall space flight center probably will once again be the target 
of the nations anger and anguish 
that says j r thompson director of marshall is a truth 
engineers learn to live with at the nasa center that designs and 
develops the most dangerous parts of a space machine 
ours are the two highrisk elements the shuttle main engine 
and the shuttle solid rocket thompson said in an interview at 
the facility in the forested hills of northern alabama in 9 
chances out of 10 when there is a catastrophic failure it will 
rest with those two elements 
when a mission goes good the focus is going to be on the 
operations end he said when things go amiss the attention is 
going to be right here its not an unfair thing were big boys 
and we know thats the job weve got 
a presidential commission concluded that the explosion that 
destroyed challenger and killed its seven crew members on jan 28 
1986 was caused by a flawed solid rocket booster that blowtorched 
against the external tank 
marshall engineers became personal targets of blame their 
judgment was ridiculed their diligence belittled and their 
competence questioned 
larry mulloy who headed the solid rocket booster program at 
marshall received hate mail and endured the collapse of a 23year 
career at nasa william lucas director at marshall resigned with 
parting bitter shots at the press ten other managers also left 
retiring or seeking jobs in private industry 
none of the more than 3400 workers at marshall escaped the 
stain 
it was devastating said bob erwin an engineer who analyzes 
stresses on the spacecraft everybody was pretty low there was 
not so much a sense of guilt as of loss there was also the sense 
of professional embarrassment something had gone terribly wrong 
and marshall was responsible 
the drumbeat of blame recalled jerry patterson an organic 
chemist and materials expert seemed to last forever 
all the nails were driven in place and we were just hanging 
there and they were still beating on us he said eventually it 
got to be too much we had accepted the responsibility what we 
had to do then was make it right 
that involved the most massive effort at reevaluation repair 
and redesign ever attempted by nasa 
teams of engineers at marshall dissected every piece of hardware 
developed at the alabama center every design was reexamined every 
test was checked over and new ones were ordered where needed 
work days stretched from 10 to 12 to 14 hours and for many 
weekends were forgotten 
thompson said more tests were made on the main engines and on 
the solid rocket boosters than were conducted before the shuttle 
first flew in 1981 the goal was not to find out if the equipment 
was just good enough but to demonstrate that it was better 
than it had to be 
the fullscale solid rocket engine with a new design for the 
flawed joint was fired five times at a test site in utah by its 
manufacturer morton thiokol inc there were hundreds of other 
firings using subscale models or partial propellant loads 
in one fullscale test flaws were intentionally introduced to 
see if the new rocket had a margin of safety it was a test never 
before attempted in the solid rocket industry 
a lot of people inside and outside the agency didnt like that 
test because they thought it was pushing the engine too far said 
thompson if it had failed it could have caused a long delay in 
shuttle flights but thompson and the marshall engineers insisted 
because he said they believed in our design and wanted to go 
out on the test stand and prove it 
the new rocket engine passed the test with margin to spare 
before challenger engineers recalled dissent against consensus 
technical views was discouraged public differences of opinion were 
rare and quickly silenced 
you were part of a team and it seemed a betrayal to take a 
contrary view said one engineer 
challenger changed that 
the accident strengthened the hand of the engineers in the 
trenches said erwin before if you objected to something the 
manager could say you were overcautious because we had never had an 
accident now if a manager wants to yield to schedule pressures we 
tell him that hes on his own 
the new openness has resulted in conflicts unknown before 
challenger in one case some experts believed a material in a 
solid rocket part needed one more test and refused to approve its 
use despite pressure from a manager at conferences it has become 
common for engineers to stand up and object to positions taken by 
their own managers 
you admire a guy who has the courage to take a position 
different from the crowd thompson said but that doesnt mean 
its a democracy youre not going to launch with a democracy 
youve got to have certain people in the system who make decisions 
and go

the nations welfare system is headed for a 
major overhaul with the conclusion of complex negotiations on a 
fiveyear plan aimed at moving welfare recipients into jobs and 
helping them collect more child support 
the initiative agreed on monday by senate house and white house 
negotiators had been close to death all summer as negotiators 
sought a balance between conservatives favoring mandatory work and 
liberals concerned about increasing benefits to the needy and 
motivating people to enter the mainstream workplace 
this was a critical day said rep tom downey dny 
chairman of the subcommittee that handled the house welfare bill 
emerging from mondays pivotal meeting 
there are some who will not be happy with the outcome 
downey said but when asked if the package would fly when presented 
to about 50 house and senate conferees late this afternoon he 
said yes 
i am very pleased said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas 
chairman of the house and senate conferees and the democratic vice 
presidential nominee i think its a good final resolution of the 
differences an excellent compromise 
reagans domestic policy adviser charles hobbs a participant 
in mondays meeting offered a conditional endorsement of the 
compromise if its okay with the conferees and if it comes down 
the way i understand it its probably okay he said 
the 334 billion welfare plan comes in above the senates own 
28 billion measure but would cost less than half of the initial 
71 billion plan passed by the house 
the cornerstone of the compromise is a job opportunities and 
basic skills jobs program offering welfare parents including 
those with preschool children services such as job search help 
education and job training child care and transportation aid would 
be available to participants 
states would have to be serving 7 percent of eligible welfare 
recipients by 1990 and 20 percent by 1995 states would be given 
600 million for the jobs program in 1989 rising to 13 billion 
in 1995 people moving into jobs would qualify for a year of 
transitional child care and medicaid benefits 
twentyseven states now provide welfare benefits to households 
with two unemployed parents the welfare bill would require those 
states to continue and effective in 1991 would require others to 
provide at least six months of benefits a year to such families 
starting in 1994 one adult in each twoparent welfare family 
would have to perform 16 hours a week of community work onthejob 
training or other specified work activities people under 25 
without high school diplomas would be able to substitute 
participation in an education program leading to a diploma or its 
equivalent 
the bill also makes new demands on states to step up child 
support collections from noncustodial parents including tougher 
paternity determination requirements and mandatory wage withholding 
upon the court award of support payments 
the 16houraweek work requirement would affect only about 7 
percent of the welfare caseload but was a primary obstacle to 
achieving agreement on the overall bill a handful of house 
liberals resisted the provision almost as fiercely as the reagan 
administration insisted it be retained

morton thiokol maker of the rocket 
booster that caused challengers destruction hopes a successful 
launch for discovery will begin an awakening from a 32monthlong 
corporate nightmare 
it will be the final demonstration to our customer nasa and 
the country that solid rocket motors are going to be a reliable 
contributor to future shuttle successes said dick davis vice 
president and assistant general manager of space operations at 
morton thiokols wasatch operations in utah 
less easily dispatched are the specters of an fbi investigation 
lawsuits by frustrated former employees and a plague of rocket 
fuelrelated accidents including an mx missile motor fire that 
killed five employees last december 
the presidential commission that investigated the jan 28 1986 
shuttle disaster found that an oring seal on the right booster 
rocket had stiffened in freezing prelaunch temperatures allowing 
superheated gas to escape and trigger an explosion 
worse the commission learned that several morton thiokol 
engineers had argued the night before that just such a disaster 
could occur but were overruled by superiors who told nasa the 
launch should proceed 
in the relentless glare of the postmortem morton thiokol 
embarked on an exhaustive booster redesign that kept some 3000 
workers busy on the field joints as well as the casetonozzle 
motor joint the nozzle assembly and hundreds of smaller components 
its been a very difficult period said davis i dont 
think any company is ever prepared for the kind of intense scrutiny 
that you get following a tragedy like challenger 
allan j mcdonald a morton thiokol engineer who had argued 
against the challenger launch was made vice president of 
engineering for space operations overseer of the booster redesign 
his guiding principle in the 500 million effort has been 
redundancy multiple seals bolts and clamps to contain the 11 
million pounds of solid fuel that burn in just two minutes 
the national aeronautics and space administration has borne the 
redesign cost and morton thiokol agreed to reap no profit 
engineers have conducted five 20 million fullscale 
testfirings of the redesigned boosters as well as hundreds of 
subscale and component tests a sixth fullscale test is planned 
for december 
with 8000 employees and an annual payroll of 220 million 
morton thiokol inc is utahs largest private employer the 
chicagobased company also produces munitions salt and specialty 
chemicals and manufactures firststage motors for the mx trident 
2 and midgetman strategic missiles and propulsion systems for 
tactical missiles 
tom russell a company vice president said aerospace profits 
which account for more than a quarter of the companys overall 
profits fell from 96 million in fiscal 1986 to 73 million in 
1987 then rose to 808 million in 1988 
even as morton thiokol struggled to recover from challenger 
accidents further begrimed its public image on dec 29 1987 five 
men were killed when 108000 pounds of fuel in an mx missile 
segment exploded destroying a 62 million building at the complex 
75 miles northwest of salt lake city the state cited morton 
thiokol for six safety violations 
just last week the company acknowledged that an old model of a 
nozzle inlet ring had been used in a motor testfired in august 
analysis proved new versions had been placed in discoverys 
boosters 
morton thiokol also has been sued by former employees among 
them roger boisjoly another engineer who protested the challenger 
launch and later resigned his lawsuits seeking 3 billion were 
recently dismissed 
in midseptember two former consultants stephen agee and 
anthony laine filed suit contending they were fired for attempting 
to bring redesign problems to light their suits also claim the 
company violated racketeering laws by filing false reports on its 
contractual obligations with nasa 
agee said on cbs west 57th saturday that the entire booster 
system was unsafe and that he wouldnt even want to be around 
when they assemble the boosters and stack them prior to launch 
discoverys boosters of course have long been in place 
assembly on a second set is nearly complete and a third set is 
being shipped to the cape and lisa malone spokeswoman for the 
kennedy space center expressed confidence in the redesign and 
testing the boosters have undergone 
morton thiokol also is the subject of an fbi inquiry into 
allegations by agee a contract engineer who worked undercover for 
the agency during his 4month tenure as a safety analyst agee 
alleged that among other things the company had concealed hazards 
from nasa

some 47 million americans will have to wait 
at least another year for the first raise in the 335anhour 
minimum wage since 1981 as senate democrats concede a major 
electionyear legislative defeat to a republican filibuster 
refusing to bow to gop demands for a broadbased subminimum 
floor under the 50yearold minimum wage democratic leaders on 
monday gave up all hope of raising the pay base by 40 cents to 
375 an hour in january 
there is no point in our continuing to pound on their door 
majority leader robert c byrd dwva said on the senate floor 
im now conceding that the republican filibuster was successful 
even before mondays action the bill faced an uncertain fate in 
the house where there was intense opposition from some southern 
and midwestern democrats 
i think its a pretty good result said senate republican 
leader bob dole of kansas this bill couldnt pass the house it 
wasnt going to pass the senate unless it was modified 
the senate had been stymied for more than a week by 
parliamentary maneuvering on both sides as the two presidential 
candidates republican george bush and democrat michael dukakis 
watched from the sidelines 
lacking the 51 votes to effectively couple an increase with 
their desire for a 90day 80 percent subminimum for newly hired 
workers republicans refused to allow any votes on the bill itself 
or amendments 
democrats meanwhile lacked the 60 votes necessary to limit the 
debate and shut off the filibuster despite the defection of eight 
gop senators to their cause last friday 
each side sought to blame the other with democrats maintaining 
that bush could have turned the vote around with a few phone calls 
to republican lawmakers 
bush three weeks ago had said he could support a modest increase 
never specifying how much but only if it was coupled with the 
creation of a broad subminimum training wage 
perhaps the word from the vice presidents campaign has not 
gotten through to our friends on the other side byrd said 
perhaps it has gotten through either way the results are 
evident some 15 million workers are the loser 
the bill sponsored by sen edward m kennedy dmass would 
have raised the minimum wage in three annual 40centsanhour 
increases to 455 by 1991 directly benefiting some 15 million 
workers now paid less than that according to kennedy 
republicans blamed kennedys refusal to compromise on a lower 
figure such as the 425 an hour suggested once by dole or 4 an 
hour as urged by bushs running mate sen dan quayle rind 
but they said kennedys refusal to compromise on the socalled 
training wage or the youth training wage as quayle called it 
overshadowed everything else 
the real reason this is being pulled down is that the senator 
from massachusetts knows we were on the very edge of passing the 
training wage said sen orrin hatch of utah the leader of the 
republican opposition 
the fact is that the international trade union movement in 
this country will not accept a training wage hatch said they 
consider the minimum wage as their single idea 
hatch had introduced an amendment calling for the 80 percent 
subminimum for the first 90 days a new employee is on a companys 
payroll saying it would give a chance to those unskilled 
undereducated youths who cannot get into the system any other way 
to prevent a vote on the amendment kennedy immediately 
introduced a substitute that would slightly expand a currently 
allowed but littleused 285 subminimum for fulltime students 
working less than 20 hours a week 
if his passes mine would be gone hatch said early in the 
debate complaining as did other republicans that their subminimum 
proposal was being denied a fair hearing under senate rules that 
favor whichever party holds a majority 
kennedy called hatchs subminimum amendment a bush hire em 
and fire em wage 
without any requirements for training or age restrictions 
employers would have an incentive to replace their workforces every 
90 days with a new group of workers paid the subminimum rate 
kennedy said 
republicans had also pushed as an alternative to a minimum wage 
increase an earned income tax credit that would have funneled about 
6 billion in federal subsidies over four years to families headed 
by minimum wage earners 
kennedy said that alternative which republicans conceded would 
have to be financed through a tax increase would leave taxpayers 
subsidizing employers who exploit their workers

the tobacco industry is mounting an expensive 
campaign to try to snuff out an oregon ballot measure that would 
create the nations toughest antismoking law 
but opponents of measure 6 will have their work cut out for them 
because a recent statewide poll found strong public support for it 
tobacco companies are using mass mailings of brochures 
newsletters and voter registration kits in hopes of scuttling 
measure 6 on the nov 8 ballot 
were going to spend a lot of money at least several 
hundred thousand dollars said mark nelson a salem lobbyist whos 
running the campaign to defeat measure 6 were going to make a 
major effort on this 
the antismoking proposal would toughen the 1981 oregon indoor 
clean air act which makes most public buildings off limits to 
smokers except in designated smoking areas 
the new proposal if approved would wipe out designated smoking 
areas and ban smoking in virtually all indoor work areas and 
enclosed places frequented by the public violators would be 
subject to civil penalties of up to 250 
smoking still would be allowed in bars and taverns tobacco 
stores and hotel and motel rooms 
the oregon lung association led a petition drive to win a spot 
on the ballot for the proposal 
gerry odisio who is coordinating the campaign for the lung 
association said nonsmokers should not have to put up with 
secondhand smoke in public facilities or workplaces 
what were talking about is a public health measure odisio 
said we know that secondhand smoke causes disease including 
lung cancer in otherwise healthy nonsmokers 
study after study has shown unhealthful levels of tobacco 
smoke in nonsmoking sections she said 
that is disputed by maura payne spokeswoman for rj reynolds 
tobacco usa 
theres no substantive scientific support for the contention 
that environmental tobacco smoke causes any significant threat to 
the health of nonsmokers she said 
in a telephone interview from the companys office in 
winstonsalem nc payne called measure 6 a dangerous abridgement 
of the rights of a minority group smokers 
even if youre a nonsmoker you should be careful of 
government infringement on other peoples rights she said 
maybe next theyre going to try to restrict whether people eat 
red meat or attend rock concerts that neighbors find too noisy 
a former oregon supreme court justice betty roberts voices 
similar concerns about possible infringement of civil liberties 
in a letter distributed by opponents of measure 6 roberts 
warned that it would authorize search warrants to root out 
evidence of illegal smoking and even bring about police arrests of 
fineignoring citizens 
odisio dismisses those concerns as unfounded saying no one has 
been fined or taken to court for violating the current law 
its a selfenforcing law odisio said it is passed with 
the understanding that most oregon citizens are lawabiding 
she said 42 states have some sort of statewide restriction on 
smoking including such things as banning smoking on elevators and 
that 36 of those restrict smoking in a wide variety of public 
places with designated smoking or nonsmoking areas the proposed 
oregon law she said would be the first to drop all designated 
areas 
other groups pitching in to try to defeat the measure are the 
oregon aflcio associated oregon industries and the oregon 
restaurant and beverage association 
the president of the oregon state bowling council bob wells 
said measure 6 would hurt his industry because a lot of bowlers are 
smokers 
if they would not be allowed to smoke for that twohour 
period they would drop out of the sport altogether or cut down on 
the number of times they bowl he said 
wells estimated bowling alleys would lose at least 10 percent of 
their customers if measure 6 passes and argued that the existing 
law has been a success in providing separate accommodations for 
smokers and nonsmokers 
odisio said the proposal is part of a nationwide trend 
its just a case of oregon being one small step in front of 
everybody else she said were not way out in left field we 
just happen to be at the front of the parade 
a poll conducted for the oregonian newspaper in portland sept 
67 asked 400 registered voters how they would vote on several 
measures that will be on the statewide ballot measure 6 was 
favored by 62 percent of those surveyed in the telephone poll and 
opposed by 36 percent the rest were undecided 
the margin of error was 49 percent

now come the vice presidential nominees in a 
different kind of debate a confrontation in which sen dan quayle 
will be out to prove that he doesnt deserve to be a campaign issue 
george bushs republican running mate and sen lloyd bentsen of 
texas the democratic candidate for vice president meet on oct 5 
in omaha neb in a 90minute debate patterned on the match 
between the presidential nominees 
quayles competence has come under almost daily challenge from 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis and lately from 
bentsen 
the patrician bentsen has shelved senatorial courtesy in favor 
of longdistance attacks on his crossaisle colleague from indiana 
and senate debate etiquette presumably will not apply next week at 
least on bentsens side of the stage 
quayle 41 a secondterm senator could try to deflect debate 
attacks by using the elaborate courtesies of the senate in handling 
his senior colleague debating dukakis sunday night bush gave a 
hint at that strategy by saying that he quayle and bentsen were 
the only three candidates in the race who are knowledgeable on 
defense issues 
campaign debaters customarily are out to raise their profiles 
to promote themselves and their positions as issues to be 
considered by the voters 
but quayle could best serve his ticket by reversing that with a 
solid errorfree debate showing nothing flashy or fancy just a 
workmanlike performance to try to silence the critics and lower 
his profile as a democratic target 
vice president bush testy when he was questioned about 
criticism of his chosen running mate in the presidential debate 
said quayle who is 41 is an outstanding young man who has stood 
up to outrageous brutal very unfair pounding since his 
nomination 
hell do very very well in the debate bush said 
the democrats think quayle is a salable campaign issue for their 
side and dukakis takes a slap at him in almost every speech i 
doubt very much that dan quayle was the best qualified person for 
that job he said sunday night and as a matter of fact i 
think for most people the notion of president quayle is a very 
very troubling notion 
quayle campaigning with bush on monday in jackson tenn 
returned the gibe after last night for most people the notion 
of president dukakis is a very very troubling notion today he 
said 
with the democrats questioning his competence quayle is in a 
position to succeed without really scoring in the vice presidential 
debate if he can hold his own and undercut the opposition claim 
that he is in way over his head 
quayle can do that by showing the voters that he isnt a dummy 
that he can answer questions under the pressure of a 
nationallytelevised debate without misspeaking that he is up to 
his assignment 
the best vice presidential candidates are those who serve as 
spokesmen and campaigners for their nominees but dont make waves 
the people running to be no 2 tend to attract the most attention 
when they err or when their records come under critical scrutiny 
both have been happening in quayles case ever since the 
question of family influence in his vietnamera national guard 
enlistment blew up into controversy just as he was nominated at the 
republican national convention 
four years ago rep geraldine ferraros family income taxes and 
her husbands business affairs became a focus of inquiry and thus a 
problem for the democratic ticket on which she ran in 1976 sen 
bob doles debate remark that world war i world war ii korea and 
vietnam were all democrat wars created a troublesome issue for 
the republican ticket 
once such questions become issues they tend to snowball for 
quayle the guard uproar was followed by questions about his 
admittedly mediocre college record and his admission into night 
law school 
errors in his campaign statements have since been added to the 
dossier things like his tonguetwisted effort to say that a good 
defense beats a good offense or was it the other way around and 
his slip in saying that he didnt live in this century 
bentsen and dukakis took it from there 
bentsen has called the republican record on energy as empty as 
dan quayles resume 
acknowledging that he and bentsen differ on some issues dukakis 
said that is healthy 
what would have happened if ronald reagan had a vice president 
like lloyd bentsen a vice president strong enough to think for 
himself and speak up for himself he asks his campaign 
crowds we havent had that kind of vice president for the past 
eight years and i dont know of anyone who thinks well have him 
in the person of j danforth quayle 
the name has become a laughter and applause line at democratic 
rallies dukakis draws it out slowly scornfully and sometimes his 
supporters recite it with him 
in their debate bush rebuked dukakis for ridiculing the name 
and said the original j danforth was killed in world war ii 
full name or nickname quayle has become a target and his 
problems are taking a republican toll richard wirthlin who 
conducts public opinion polls for the white house and the 
republican party says the quayle nomination thus far has been more 
negative than positive for the ticket with bentsen viewed as the 
stronger nominee 
the question is to what extent do people vote for the ticket 
because of the vice president wirthlin said in the past that 
has not been a big issue 
the democrats are campaigning to make it one this time 
quayles best opportunity to block them comes next week in omaha

the ku klux klan and the national park 
service have been negotiating plans for a white pride day rally 
at independence hall in november a park official says 
the park service expects to approve an application for a permit 
to hold the rally at the hall where the declaration of 
independence and the us constitution were signed chief ranger 
bob burn said monday 
the application has not been filed yet but will be soon said 
richard fogel a klan official who lives in red lion pa 
for the past two weeks the kkk and the park service have been 
discussing police protection parking and other concerns associated 
with the rally scheduled for nov 5 at the hall burn said 
burn said the application probably would be approved because 
under the first amendment and the regulations we operate under 
theres not much room for denying it 
marie e jones an executive board member of the philadlephia 
branch of the national association for the advancement of colored 
people agreed the constitution gives the kkk the right to rally 
but she said it is sad to see that people who have accepted 
violence as a way of life toward people who are not their race or 
creed can imbue others with their hatred 
i do hope there will be some black faces there she said 
the klan might invite other rightwing groups such as the 
national democratic front and the natiional states rights party 
fogel said 
in may about 40 people dressed in klan robes marched in 
parkside pa in suburban philadelphia they were greeted by a 
crowd of about 1000 counterdemonstrators

with more americans aware of aids than ever 
before federal health officials are urging the nations governors 
and clergy to emphasize prevention during october aids prevention 
and awareness month 
a similar designation was made last october when a flashy 
broadcast print and direct mail advertising campaign was launched 
many of those television spots all identified by the phrase 
america responds to aids still are running and are tied in 
with a pamphlet called understanding aids that was mailed to 
every us household last spring 
despite efforts such as this we need to keep alerting the 
public about aids health and human services secretary otis r 
bowen said in a recent letter asking each of the nations governors 
to declare october aids prevention and education month 
a survey issued last month by the conference board shows 
americans now consider aids to be the most serious problem facing 
the united states in january 1987 aids had ranked ninth 
the widespread media attention focused on the aids dilemma is 
obviously being heard across the country said fabian linden 
executive director of the boards consumer research center 
the survey was conducted for the nonprofit businesssupported 
group by national family opinion inc of toledo ohio which polled 
5000 us households 
in a sense the department has been successful in making 
the public aware about the fact that aids is a danger but 
obviously we still have the problem of making sure people are 
heeding the prevention aspect of it public health service 
spokesman jim brown said in a recent interview 
while 73394 americans had been diagnosed with aids as of sept 
19 thousands more are known to be in earlier stages of the disease 
and the government estimates that up to 15 million people in the 
united states are infected with the aidscausing virus 
because of growing data about the diseases long incubation 
period medical experts are increasingly fearful that most if not 
virtually all of those infected eventually will become sick and 
die of aids 
in letters to members of the clergy distributed through central 
offices of the nations churches and denominations bowen and other 
top hhs officials asked the religious leaders to set aside the 
third weekend of october to relay potentially lifesaving messages 
about aids 
such a message could be as simple as urging your congregation 
to call the public health services national aids hotline but 
we hope you will want to talk to your congregation at greater 
length about this topic of such extraordinary importance to us 
all said the letter also signed by surgeon general c everett 
koop and dr robert e windom the assistant hhs secretary for 
health 
enclosed with the letter were sample questions and answers about 
aids not mentioned in the material sent to priests rabbis and 
ministers was the health services position that condoms can be a 
barrier although not 100 percent effective against passing the 
infection during sexual contact 
another part of this years more focused october campaign is 
letters to university presidents and deans along with a videotape 
for college students entitled aids why should i care 
in a letter to the deans windom said onefifth of the aids 
cases reported so far have occurred among people 20 to 29 years 
old 
since the average incubation period is seven years or 
longer its clear that any of the 14000plus patients in this 
group were high school or college age at the time of their 
infection said windom 
we must leave no stone unturned in teaching students about the 
potential risks posed by aids and how they can avoid them he 
wrote 
the video includes appearances by such wellknown performers as 
dionne warwick chita rivera nell carter mariel hemingway and 
gary busey

congressional and administration officials are 
close to a pentagon spending compromise that would remove one of 
the last major obstacles to passage of all legislation needed to 
pay the governments bills by the oct 1 start of a new fiscal year 
the two sides are near agreement on the complicated defense 
department measure according to congressional sources who declined 
to be identified monday 
the proposed compromise would remove some of the restrictions 
imposed earlier by the democraticcontrolled congress on reagans 
cherished star wars antimissile defense plan the sources said 
but overall the strategic defense initiative as the program is 
formally known still would receive 41 billion the same amount 
that was in the bill reagan vetoed on aug 3 the sources said 
reagan had sought 48 billion for star wars compared to the 
39 billion the program now receives 
approval of a pentagon bill is the major remaining hurdle to be 
cleared before congress finishes work on all 13 appropriations 
bills needed to finance the government starting saturday 
the last time all 13 spending bills were finished by the start 
of the new fiscal year was 1948 
house and senate democratic leaders are pushing to finish the 
bills and avoid giving the gop and vice president george bush a 
potentially embarrassing electionyear issue 
after yearlong budget battles congress sent the president a 
1400page 600 billion catchall spending bill last december 
nearly three months into the present fiscal year 
in reagans state of the union address he threatened to veto 
any similar giant spending bills this year and scores of lawmakers 
signed letters pledging to support him 
this years appropriations work was made easier by the budget 
summit agreement between reagan and congressional leaders last 
november 
that pact settled many broad spending questions for fiscal 1989 
but disputes over various provisions within several individual 
bills have caused delays 
lawmakers have said the dispute over the defense bill was the 
most serious and that its resolution would make it likely that all 
13 bills would be finished on time 
many democrats fear that if congress does not finish its 
appropriations work on time this year the president and 
republicans will use that failure to paint the majority party as 
inefficient and incapable of adhering to budget processes 
reagan has thus far signed four appropriations bills and two 
others have been sent to his desk 
the pentagon spending compromise also drops a restriction added 
by congress on testing of depressedtrajectory missiles a type of 
atomictipped weapon being developed by the pentagon the sources 
said 
the bill provides 300 billion for all pentagon spending the 
same as the earlier bill that would be a slight decrease from the 
current 302 billion pentagon budget

the supreme court has let stand michigan court 
rulings that a woman has a constitutional right to end her 
pregnancy despite her husbands objections 
without comment or recorded dissent the justices on monday 
denied an emergency request by the estranged husband of shawn lewis 
of flint mich that she be prevented from having an abotion 
in august mrs lewis told her husband carlton she was seven 
or eight weeks pregnant and intended to have an abortion lewis 
immediately went to court to prevent it 
michigans highest court had rejected the husbands action but 
appointed a guardian for the fetus until 5 pm monday to allow 
time to seek emergency help from justice antonin scalia who 
handles emergency appeals from michigan for the nations highest 
court 
scalia referred the request to the full supreme court which 
denied it 
three other supreme court members chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices byron r white and john paul stevens 
rejected similar emergency requests to stop abortions earlier this 
year 
lewis attorney steven moss said the husband was upset by the 
verdict 
thats his baby and he wants it moss said 
mrs lewis was happy and relieved said attorney shelley 
spivack she did not know when the 24yearold woman would have the 
planned abortion mrs lewis has refused to discuss the case 
james bopp jr of terre haute ind the lawyer who had filed an 
emergency appeal on behalf of the fetus said he planned to file a 
further appeal by the end of the week 
im hoping that theyll hear it on merits said bopp they 
didnt decide the case on merits they just denied the stay we 
lost part but we didnt lose all 
bopp had asked that mrs lewis be kept from having an abortion 
until the full supreme court considers a formal appeal 
in the appeal bopp urged the court to overturn its landmark 
1973 decision legalizing abortion 
were very pleased for shawn lewis said howard simon 
executive director of the american civil liberties unions michigan 
chapter our job was to protect her right to choose whether that 
choice is to carry that pregnancy to term or terminate her 
pregnancy 
if the situation were reversed and a woman wanted to carry a 
pregnancy to term against her husbands wishes the case never 
would have gone all the way to the highest court in the land he 
said 
nobody would have thought he had a right to force her to have 
an abortion if she didnt want one he said the consistent 
principle is respect for each persons dignity 
mrs lewis filed for divorce last january the couple had a 
brief reconciliation but have said they want to continue divorce 
proceedings 
a genesee county trial judge barred mrs lewis from having an 
abortion but a state appeals court threw out the judges order 
the michigan supreme court last thursday said it was not 
persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this 
court 
the cases are meyers vs lewis a240 and lewis vs lewis 
a244

a bill that vice president george bush says is 
a good way to help the homeless is drawing flak from the reagan 
administration which argues that some of its provisions are 
duplicative and ineffective 
in a statement distributed monday the administrations office 
of management and budget said that portions of the socalled 
mckinney bill duplicate existing programs and are so complex 
that they do not effectively address the needs of this 
population 
in his debate sunday with democratic rival michael dukakis 
republican presidential nominee bush said that to help the nations 
homeless people the government should fully fund the mckinney 
act 
the legislation was initially signed into law on july 22 1987 
after president reagan railed about the measures expense and 
duplicative programs 
the law created programs worth 11 billion over the last two 
years for housing health care education job training and other 
help for the nations homeless people legislation authorizing 13 
billion worth of expenditures for the next two years is working its 
way through congress 
in its statement omb said it favored the bills programs for 
emergency food and shelter and for transitional housing 
but the agency said the administration opposes parts of the bill 
which would give bonuses to states that place welfare recipients in 
jobs would eliminate some rental assistance and would pay 
salaries for state workers who coordinate homeless activities 
the statement did not however contain any threat to veto the 
bill 
when the original version of the legislation passed the house on 
a 264121 vote on march 5 1987 all but eight of the votes cast 
against it were by republicans gop lawmakers argued that the 
easure would increase the federal deficit and was so generous that 
it might worsen the problem by encouraging even more people to live 
in the streets 
passage came two nights after a highly publicized grate 
american sleepout in which several members of congress joined 
homeless advocate mitch snyder and actor martin sheen for an 
evening sleeping on a grate two blocks from the capitol 
the senate passed a less expensive version of the bill on a 
voice vote a month later 
housing advocates have been disappointed with the results of the 
legislation the reagan administration has consistently sought 
and congress has provided actual spending levels far below the 
amounts permitted in the bill for the first two years of the law 
for example congress appropriated only 700 million out of a 
possible 11 billion 
the money provided under the legislation was largely distributed 
to nonprofit agencies and to state and local governments it has 
been used to provide emergency food and shelter to purchase and 
rehabilitate group homes to pay for health and education programs 
to help tenants pay rent and for other projects 
the measure was named after the late rep stewart b mckinney 
rconn one of the legislations original sponsors mckinney died 
may 7 1987 
estimates of the number of homeless in the country range between 
250000 to 3 million people

those great pop songs of the early 1960s will 
survive suds a numbing regurgitation of many of the musical 
hits of the era when the beatles were changing the sound of popular 
music 
there are some terrific musical memories including respect 
dedicated to the one i love the locomotion do wah 
diddy diddy you dont have to say you love me you cant 
hurry love and nearly 40 other top 10 tunes crammed into the show 
what sinks suds is not the songs but the dippy story that 
authors melinda gilb steve gunderson and bryan scott have 
inflicted on these golden oldies its dumb without being fun 
they have set their musical in a laundromat where cindy the 
worlds oldest looking teenager is celebrating her birthday 
alone and depressed cindys cat fluffy has been run over by a 
corvair her pen pal boyfriend has dropped her because he found 
someone with better handwriting and she discovers she owes 10000 
to the internal revenue service for some relatives back taxes 
cindy tries to end it all by wrapping pedal pushers around her 
neck throwing them into a maytag and agitating herself to death 
shes stopped by two guardian angels one named dee dee who looks 
like marlo thomas on a bad day and the other marge whose red 
bouffant hairdo confirms she has cornered the market on hairspray 
the duo counsel the girl trying to cheer her up and persuade 
her to get on with her life its these therapeutic sessions that 
take the form of musical interludes usually three or four hit 
numbers stitched together occasionally they take off like a 
funny version of secret agent man done with style by 
gunderson who plays all the men and even one woman in the show 
more often you grow impatient with the dialogue waiting for 
the story to end and the music to begin again the cast is 
competent but not distinguished the women christine sevec susan 
mosher and gilb belt out the songs with gusto if not any 
particular style 
suds which opened last weekend is the first attraction at 
stage left a cabaret theater in the criterion center the center 
is an impressive theater complex located in times square and also 
contains a more formal theater which will open later in the year 
the playing area has good sightlines and comfortable seating now 
all it needs is a show

things have turned nasty in new yorks us 
senate race where democratic incumbent daniel patrick moynihans 
gop opponent already has called his rival a liar a coward and a 
crummy boss 
moynihan a twoterm senate veteran is known to most of the 
world as a professorial type who writes a lot of books taught at 
harvard and served as us ambassador to india and the united 
nations 
but republican robert mcmillan is hoping to expose another side 
of moynihan using an aggressive campaign with sharp personal 
attacks and in the process salvage an underfunded and 
underpublicized effort to unseat moynihan 
its a long shot gamble 
moynihan mcmillan claims is an arrogant and overrated senator 
who was chicken to debate him condones safe sodomy for 
homosexuals lies to the press is too abrasive to keep employees 
on his staff and too lazy to do his official duties in washington 
what kind of a man is this pat moynihan mcmillan asked last 
month hes on the record as one who would lie if he thought he 
could get away with it 
moynihan 61 has tried to appear above the fray in the face of 
mcmillans charges 
when asked about being called a liar moynihan said only i 
heard that thats ok ive been called worse things than that 
mcmillan 56 a wealthy long island lawyer who worked for 
president nixon in the 1960s also maintains that moynihan hasnt 
been the kind of shining beacon to the youth of new york that 
mcmillan recalls from his adolescent days in front of the radio he 
suggested flash gordon the lone ranger captain midnight or jack 
armstrong as good role models 
many attribute the tone of mcmillans campaign to one of its 
chief strategists robert blasdell who once worked with campaign 
expert roger ailes an influential voice in republican nominee 
george bushs presidential effort ailes is known for his 
bareknuckles campaign style 
mcmillans attacks havent had a discernible effect among 
voters but they have prompted moynihan campaign aide lawrence 
odonnell jr to suggest that new yorkers might be owed an apology 
for the nonsense theyve been subjected to by this candidacy 
this is what comes from desperation odonnell said of 
mcmillans tactics theres a very cold calculated decision 
being made to go after pat moynihan the person and that youll 
find in a state where moynihan has a 70 percent approval rating is 
the most egregious tactical mistake the opposition campaign could 
ever have 
moynihan won 65 percent of the vote en route to his defeat of 
littleknown brooklyn state assemblywoman florence sullivan in 1982 
by more than 15 million votes a poll conducted earlier this month 
by the marist college institute for public opinion in poughkeepsie 
ny showed him with a 6321 percent lead over mcmillan among 601 
likely voters 
financially mcmillan has little hope of matching moynihan in 
spending the most recent contribution filing with the federal 
election commission showed mcmillans campaign 40000 in debt 
while moynihan had 19 million in the bank 
since starting his campaign may 9 mcmillan has been on the road 
almost constantly appearing at county fairs political picnics and 
local television and radio stations he has logged about 27000 
miles by car 
in that time the gop candidate has tried to prove that 
moynihans intellectual bent hasnt paid dividends for new yorkers 
since the former harvard professor won election to the senate in 
1976 
mcmillan says moynihan has exercised benign neglect toward 
new yorkers as senator moynihan says i plead guilty about his 
enthusiasm for writing and lecturing but insists that one of his 
senatorial duties is to articulate the issues 
and odonnell says moynihan has been responsible for delivering 
about 5 billion in federal aid to new york in his second term 
alone 
mcmillan has also tried to make political hay by pointing out 
that moynihan has missed more than 400 roll call votes since 
arriving in the senate but moynihan says that when first elected 
he promised only to do better than the senatorial average as far as 
attendance in the house was concerned he said hes done that by 
being present for about 92 percent of the votes 
mcmillan leveled the liar charge in connection with an incident 
last year when a buffalo ny news reporter challenged moynihan 
on why he had been excluded from a moynihan press briefing 
moynihan denied that hed ordered the reporter barred but moynihan 
chief of staff harrison rainie said his boss had indeed given 
orders to keep the reporter out 
rainie a former new york daily news reporter resigned a few 
days later 
one day of staff confusion said odonnell of the incident

an agricultural research bill to provide 206 
million for programs ranging from alternative crops to fish farming 
is headed for the senate after winning approval in the house 
the land is the only thing that can produce new wealth for 
this vast economic empire we call the united states of america and 
it begins with research agriculture chairman e kika de la 
garza dtexas said monday as the bill received house approval on 
a voice vote 
research grants to develop new types of crop production would be 
authorized by the bill the measure also would establish a national 
institute for alternative agricultural products within the 
agriculture department 
a nonprofit agricultural research commercialization corp also 
would be created that would use loans loan guarantees interest 
subsidies and other means to spur product commercialization 
under the measure 20 million a year through fiscal year 2000 
would be authorized for development of new agricultural products 
15 million to commercialize products and up to 600000 to enhance 
marketing of existing ones 
the bills overall price tag was estimated by the congressional 
budget office at 206 million over five years 
with perhaps three weeks to go before lawmakers adjourn 
however the future of the measure is clouded the senate has 
offered no guarantees that it will get to the measure 
the bill would establish grants for research into statistical 
methods of measuring chemicals and microorganisms in food products 
and means of preventing contamination 
also under the measure an office of groundwater policy 
determination would be established within the agriculture 
department that provision was included at the urging of republican 
rep fred grandy of iowa where concern is growing over findings of 
pesticide contamination in groundwater 
the bill would provide 3 million in each of three years for 
research into aquaculture or fish farming 
it also would reauthorize federal research aid for examination 
and development of crops used in socalled critical materials the 
measure would set the program at an 8 million level for each of 
the next two years 
most money under that program would go to research into guayule 
a plant grown in the southwest that produces a natural rubber 
that can be used for highperformance aircraft tires 
the bill would enable farmers to plant socalled alternative 
crops in 1989 and 1990 without losing their base acreage listed 
with the department of agriculture the base acreage is used to 
calculate the size of the federal payments they get for producing 
wheat feed grains cotton and rice 
meanwhile the house approved on a voice vote a separate measure 
to establish a 25member commission on the improvement of the 
federal crop insurance program 
ten of the 21 voting members would come from the insurance 
industry and 10 from among agricultural producers with the manager 
of the corporation also serving on the panel the four nonvoting 
members would come from congress 
the goal of the panel would be to recommend changes in the 
program which has lost more than 1 billion since 1980 when a 
major overhaul was approved

residents are concerned about a rock 
maple tree that provided a shady spot for poet joyce kilmer who 
may have been inspired by it when he wrote i think that i shall 
never see a poem as lovely as a tree 
the hospital on whose grounds the tree sits has announced it is 
closing after 88 years 
it would be too bad if something happened to that tree but 
you never know with the hospital going and all said sister mary 
rosalie morrison of the sisters of providence order which owns 
farren memorial hospital 
local historians say the grand old maple inspired the kilmer 
poem memorized by millions of schoolchildren on arbor days past 
other communities have made the same claim but montague offers 
as proof the many visits the young kilmer paid to the village of 
montague city to stay with his friend and spiritual adviser the 
rev edmund d casey a roman catholic priest and chaplain at the 
hospital from 1910 to 1937 
town lore has it that kilmer visited around 1910 and sought 
shade beneath the huge tree eight years before he was killed in 
france in world war i at age 32 
the poet is said to have stayed in a large house on the north 
side of the hospital according to arthur paulin retired director 
of engineering who worked at the hospital for 55 years the house 
burned down in the 1940s

the number of working americans with wages 
below the poverty level for a family of four increased by more than 
1 million last year according to a new senate report 
the report prepared by the democratic staff of the senate 
budget committee from census bureau data concluded that both 
highpaying and lowpaying jobs have grown at the expense of a 
shrinking middle class over the past eight years 
fueling the debate over the quality of 16 million new jobs since 
president reagan took office the report was immediately criticized 
by senate republicans as misleading and inaccurate 
sixtyfour percent of american jobs paid middle level wages 
defined as those between 11611 and 46444 in 1987 dollars in 
1979 said the report released monday 
between the peak of the business cycle in 1979 and the latest 
year of the current expansion in 1987 only 38 percent of the 
increase in employment was in middle wage jobs it added 
as a result according to the data the share of middlewage 
earners declined from 64 percent to 613 percent between 1979 and 
1987 those earning a poverty wage climbed from 324 percent to 
342 percent and those with high wages more than 46444 rose 
from 37 percent to 45 percent of the working population 
the committees chairman retiring sen lawton chiles dfla 
said a comparison of the 1987 data from the census bureaus current 
population survey released earlier this month with 1986 data shows 
a worsening of the trend 
according to the data 4045 million workers were paid a 
fulltime equivalent of less than 11611 last year compared with 
3938 million in 1986 meanwhile the number of americans with jobs 
exceeding 46444 fell from 54 million in 1986 to 532 million 
last year 
the sad truth chiles said is that jobs paying below the 
poverty level are growing faster than any other kind and jobs that 
provide a middleclass standard of living are a shrinking part of 
our job landscape 
sen pete v domenici of new mexico the committees ranking 
republican and former chairman called the report opportunistic 
political misleading and inaccurate and predicted that it 
eventually will be discredited 
most of the new jobs created during the expansion have been in 
occupations that pay well in technical and managerial fields the 
kind of jobs we want for our kids he said only 8 percent of 
the jobs generated by this expansion pay under 7000 annually 
the only group going against the trend was women according to 
the report middlewage and highwage jobs among them increased by 
12 percentage points and 05 percentage points to 554 percent and 
18 percent respectively over the past eight years 
the share of women in the workforce with lowpaying jobs 
meanwhile fell from 446 percent in 1979 to 429 percent last year 
men fared the worst with the middleincome share falling from 
721 percent in 1979 to 666 percent last year the share of 
lowwage earners among men climbed from 223 percent to 265 
percent over the same period while the proportion of highwage 
earners rose from 56 percent to 69 percent 
among blacks and other minorities the share of lowincome 
workers and highincome earners increased by 12 percentage points 
and 06 percentage points to 417 percent and 23 percent 
respectively the proportion of middleincome minority workers 
declined from 578 percent to 56 percent over the eight years

michael dukakis has already turned his closing 
statement from the first presidential debate into a tag line for 
two campaign commercials that begin airing tonight 
the best america is not behind us the best america is yet to 
come dukakis says in both 30second spots 
one called opportunity includes only the closing lines 
from his sunday night debate with george bush at wake forest 
university in winstonsalem nc 
the other our concern focuses on his pitch for universal 
health insurance but also mentions college opportunity and 
includes the closing line 
the length of the run has not been determined dukakis 
spokeswoman lorraine voles said monday 
we have an opportunity working together to build that 
future to build a better america to build a best america 
dukakis said at the close of the debate in a passage also 
frequently found in his stump speeches 
because the best america doesnt hide we compete he 
continued the best america doesnt waste we invest the best 
america doesnt leave some of its citizens behind we bring 
everyone along and the best america is not behind us the best 
america is yet to come 
the health care pitch focuses on the democratic nominees 
promise to seek legislation requiring most employers to provide 
health insurance to their workers 
i think its time that when you got a job in this country that 
it came with health insurance dukakis says in the debate footage 
the passage from the closing statement was chosen for an ad 
because it focuses on dukakis effort to win broad support among 
middle class voters a segment dukakis has characterized as 
victims of the reagan recovery 
dukakis aides had planned to use at least one segment from the 
debate and likely the closing statement for a new ad and then 
also decided to make a second ad with the health care material 
campaign aides said

food aid to needy countries has dropped and 
could fall further because of rising commodity prices according to 
agriculture department analysts 
the food and agriculture organization a united nations agency 
estimates that aid in the form of cereal grain shipments in the 12 
months ended june 30 was about 105 million metric tons down 14 
percent from 122 million tons a year earlier 
ray nightingale of the agriculture departments economic 
research service said the united states provided 65 percent of last 
years 105 million tons and was followed distantly by the 
european economic community with 15 percent canada 10 percent 
and japan and australia each with about 3 percent 
for the fourth consecutive year he said the 1974 world food 
conference goal of 10 million tons of food aid was exceeded last 
year 
however given no significant increases in the major donors 
198889 foodaid budgets and higher commodity prices the volume 
of food aid may fall in 198889 and achievement of the 
10milliontongoal is doubtful nightingale said 
the us aid program under food for peace or pl 480 as it is 
also known was increased nearly 5 percent for the fiscal year 
ending sept 30 to nearly 15 billion 
nightingale writing in the october issue of agricultural 
outlook magazine said about twothirds of the volume under food 
for peace was wheat and wheat products while feed grains and 
vegetable oils made up about 5 percent each rice dairy products 
pulses and other products made up the remainder 
africa accounted for nearly half the us allocations in 
198788 asia about a third and latin america about a fifth 
nightingale said the dollar amount of the 198889 allocations 
under food for peace has not been decided but that the reagan 
administration has requested about 14 billion which effectively 
would roll back the 5 percent increase of 198788 
the 198889 money for food for peace is included in usda 
appropriation bills currently being negotiated by a house and 
senate conference committee 
nightingale said that with few exceptions crop prospects in 
developing countries look good this season and that food 
supplies are up relative to current consumption 
however greater assistance is needed this year to rebuild 
stocks that were drawn down heavily last year he said 
grains are the mainstay of food aid with cereals making up 75 
percent of the diet in asia and 50 percent to 70 percent in africa 
nightingale said although these regions produce a large share of 
the worlds cereal crops much that enters world trade is grown in 
north america where drought has reduced supplies this year 
the usda monitors 55 countries for signs of food shortfall 
newly available information on the foodaid share of some 
countries food imports indicates greater dependence on aid than 
previously thought nightingale said 
some countries have allocated less foreign exchange to food 
imports than thought earlier he said and because prices are up 
the estimated amount of commercial imports will be only 65 million 
tons compared with 117 million in 198788

the agriculture department says three food 
stamp projects using plastic magnetic strip cards instead of paper 
coupons will be conducted in parts of arizona new mexico and 
minnesota 
assistant secretary john w bode said monday that nearly 30000 
food stamp households in the three states will use the cards to see 
if the system will be easier for people to use and to help reduce 
lost or stolen coupons 
the projects are scheduled to begin within the next 8 to 12 
months and run for at least three years he said an evaluation 
will be made to see if the electronic system might be used 
nationally 
bode said the 13 million project will operate by running the 
plastic cards through a computer terminal at grocery checkout 
counters the cost of the food will be automatically deducted from 
the familys total monthly food stamp allotment 
in addition he said some of the food stamp recipients will be 
able to use the same plastic cards for other public benefits such 
as aid for families with dependent children 
bode said arizona will get 580853 from usda to design its 
projects which will be tested in mesa with services to 6500 
households 
minnesota will receive 385309 to test kits system in ramsey 
county among 13000 households and new mexico will get 379 for 
its test in albuquerque among 10150 households 
nationally nearly 19 million people are getting food stamp 
benefits based on family size and adjusted household incomes the 
program costs about 126 billion a year

luciano pavarottis singing was ravishing and 
his costars were in sterling voice for the metropolitan operas 
opening night performance of il trovatore monday but the 
production lacked excitement at times resembling a concert more 
than an opera 
the staging of the fabrizio melano production which was new 
last november works against excitement the set is a high 
staircase extending across the stage most of the time the singers 
take turns standing alone on the stairs the stage is kept dark 
with a changing backdrop of dark and white clouds 
of the three stars sherrill milnes took vocal honors in the 
first two acts his voice strong and warm from the first note 
while pavarotti and eva marton held back for the last two acts 
pavarotti as manrico was tender with the leonora sung by eva 
marton and with azucena sung by fiorenza cossotto when there was 
reason for manrico to be firm pavarottis tones became stalwart 
he also acted effectively using spare but telling gestures 
in 1976 pavarotti sang at the mets opening night in this same 
opera it was his first met venture into heavier roles than the 
light clear bel canto parts he had been singing one heard strain 
in his voice as he repeatedly sang manrico that season now the 
role sounds natural and totally unstrained 
miss marton was singing leonora at the met for the first time 
her voice is closer to being shrill than soft and sweet but she 
has the volume flexibility and stamina for the part the lastact 
duet with milnes was excitingly sung by both and her damor 
sullali rosee was affecting 
miss cossotto who made her met debut 20 years ago began with a 
hard vibrato but she dug into the part of azucena with artistry 
bass jeffrey wells a native of baton rouge la made his met 
debut singing virtually the entire first scene wells who has sung 
the captain of the guards in this opera with the washington opera 
and canadian opera was selfpossessed and sounded splendid 
james levine conducted 
first lady nancy reagan attended the opening seated in one of 
the center boxes also in the audience were united kingdom 
ambassador and mrs antony acland italian ambassador and mrs 
rinaldo petrignani mr and mrs henry kissinger oscar de la renta

president reagan is expected to sign 
legislation to boost spending on protection of endangered species 
with a special focus on efforts to pressure ivoryproducing african 
nations to crack down on elephant poaching 
we have no major objections to the bill barbara clay 
spokeswoman for the white house office of management and budget 
said monday after the house completed congressional action on a 
renewal of the endangered species act 
the 15yearold law a world model for preserving plants 
animals and fish from extinction prohibits trade in endangered or 
threatened species and requires the government to take affirmative 
steps to save them and avoid actions that would hurt them 
in separate action monday the house sent the senate a bill to 
reauthorize the 1972 marine mammal protection act and initiate a 
us program to curb the mounting losses of dolphins to yellowfin 
tuna fishermen in the pacific 
the passage of the endangered species act renewal capped four 
years of struggle by congressional environmentalists to strengthen 
the basic law and raise the amount that can be spent on the 
protection program 
the legislation worked out by house and senate negotiators 
would authorize subject to the appropriations process the 
spending of 56 million next year rising to 66 million in 1992 
the current level is about 39 million 
the bill contains a new program that would provide money to 
states that enter into cooperative agreements to assist in 
preserving endangered or threatened species states could share 15 
million next year going up to 18 million in 1992 
the legislation also would authorize us spending of 25 
million through 1993 in an effort to halt population declines among 
african elephants whose numbers reportedly have dropped to 700000 
from 15 million in 1979 
the interior department would be required to review 
elephantconservation programs of africas ivoryproducing nations 
and bar imports of ivory from countries whose programs are deemed 
ineffective to halt elephant poaching 
the bill would bar raw ivory imports from any nation without a 
native elephant population and would require us ivory importers 
and exporters to obtain licenses from the department 
curtis bohlen a vice president of the world wildlife 
federation said the us action should put teeth into 
international efforts to halt the illegal hunting of elephants 
its not going to happen overnight but its a good step 
forward he said in a telephone interview 
a violation of the elephant protection provisions could bring a 
maximum civil penalty of 5000 and a top criminal penalty of a 
200000 fine and a year in prison maximum fines for violating the 
basic endangered species act would also be boosted from 20000 to 
50000 
there currently are nearly 1000 species on the 
endangeredthreatened list about 400 of them native to the united 
states 
the bill would require the interior department to step up 
efforts to monitor the condition of species proposed for addition 
to the list environmentalists say about 80 species have become 
extinct while awaiting formal protection 
the way for passage of the legislation was cleared after a 
compromise was reached over a reagan administration plan to require 
shrimp harvesters to use excluder devices to prevent sea turtles 
from drowning in their nets 
the bill would delay mandatory use of the devices in offshore 
waters until may 1 1989 and in inshore waters until a year later 
in the interim the national academy of sciences would study the 
viability of sea turtle populations 
under the marine mammal bill the commerce department would be 
able to ban tuna imports from nations that fail to take steps to 
reduce the drowning deaths of dolphins in tuna nets to rates 
comparable to the us pacific tuna fleet 
dolphins are at risk because schools of yellowfin tuna are 
frequently found swimming beneath dolphins in the eastern pacific 
congressional committees have been told that 115000 dolphins died 
in foreign nets last year compared to less than 14000 in us 
nets 
the bill also would require a study of the effects on dolphins 
of socalled seal bombs used by commercial yellowfin tuna boats and 
a study of the high death rates of the atlantic bottlenosed dolphin 
off the east coast in 1987 and 1988

eastern airlines decision to lay off 4000 
workers apparently was a normal business move not an antiunion 
tactic two federal appeals judges have suggested 
at a hearing monday on a lower courts ruling that the layoffs 
are illegal circuit judges james l buckley and stephen williams 
challenged arguments by union lawyers that the airline was trying 
to weaken organized labor at the bargaining table 
james linsey representing the air line pilots association said 
the layoffs were inconsistent with past eastern practices he said 
they also violated railway labor act requirements to preserve the 
status quo during labor negotiations 
there certainly is past practice to cut unprofitable routes 
said williams 
there is no history of dramatic downsizing linsey said 
referring to easterns closing of its kansas city hub and the 
elimination of service to 14 cities 
but williams said figures showed that eastern had made other 
large cuts in its work force since 1980 
last month us district judge barrington parker ruled that the 
layoffs were subject to negotiation with its unions under the 
railway labor act parker granted the injunction sought by the 
pilots union the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers and the transport workers union of america 
but parker ruled that eastern could proceed with its plan to 
stop service in 14 cities and close its kansas city hub 
the us circuit court of appeals here allowed eastern to 
proceed with the layoffs as well after the airline posted a 47 
million bond to cover a months worth of wages for the furloughed 
workers 
during mondays hearing buckley challenged linseys argument 
that the decision by easterns parent texas air corp not to 
invest any money in the financially troubled airline was motivated 
by a desire to eventually close the carrier because its work force 
was unionized 
that decision also fits with certain financial realities 
buckley said 
buckley also suggested that texas airs decision to invest money 
in continental airlines easterns nonunion sister carrier 
resulted from a business judgment that a dollar invested in 
continental will go further

the united states and soviet union have held 
preliminary talks on ways to limit the spread of ballistic missiles 
to third world countries according to an administration official 
us officials had made it known earlier this month that they 
hoped such a meeting could be arranged with soviet officials while 
they visited washington for broader arms control discussions 
the spread of ballistic missiles to such countries as argentina 
brazil and north korea has been a concern of the united states and 
its industrial allies for some time 
the united states and its six major trading partners last year 
agreed to restrict exports of items that could be used to build 
ballistic missiles with a range of more than 180 miles and a 
payload in excess of 1100 pounds 
the allies reiterated their concern about missile proliferation 
among third world nations at a meeting earlier this month in rome 
and it was hoped at that time to enlist soviet involvement 
the state department said the subject was discussed in a meeting 
monday between assistant secretary of state allen holmes and viktor 
p karpov the senior soviet arms control negotiator

technique for mesmerizing lobsters 
published in tiny dublin nh the oldest continuously 
published almanac in the united states hits newsstands today with 
its usual homey brand of new useful and entertaining matter 
for the 9 million readers it claims 
a competing farmers almanac which is marking its 55th year 
was released earlier this month that publication is sold to banks 
insurance companies and other businesses for distribution to 
customers as a promotion and claims a circulation of more than 5 
million 
started in 1792 the 224page old farmers almanac also contains 
its usual fearless extended weather forecast for 1989 for 16 us 
regions 
editor judson hale claims 80 percent accuracy with the secret 
formula and the most modern scientific calculation based on solar 
activity although it failed to predict last summers devastating 
drought 
looking ahead the almanac predicts heavy snow starting around 
thanksgiving from chicago to new england and down the east coast 
with a frigid december in some sections before temperatures rise 
and the weather dries 
that means a white christmas but snow stopping in time for 
cork popping at new years 
while new england southern florida and the desert southwest 
should prepare for belownormal temperatures the rest of the 
country will get a warmer winter than usual 
for the summer the almanac calls for cooler wetter weather

chicago texas oklahoma and the pacific coast 
but for the oftendisappointed fans of bostons beloved red sox 
next septembers forecast is the most crucial it comes with the 
warning sox in first expect the worst 
the familiar black and yellow publication punctuated this year 
with sporty red highlights again offers predictions for consumers 
who can expect fake caviar lowcalorie tortilla chips scented 
newspaper ads and the ultimate indignity garbage rationing

the casual reader may also be drawn to educational features 
such as the straight facts about warts and ways to get rid of 
them ranging from bizarre and complicated to extremely 
disgusting and downright criminal 
muskie the former democratic senator from maine and us 
secretary of state offered a followup to a 1984 article on 
hypnotizing chickens with his own foolproof ways to hypnotize a 
lobster 
by stroking the tail in a downward motion curling it as you 
go he said you can impress friends by getting the lobster to do

its taken nasa 32 months to recover from 
challenger and get ready to try again it may take roger boisjoly 
even longer 
boisjoly then one of the chief engineers for rocket 
manufacturer morton thiokol warned his bosses on jan 27 1986 
that a flawed rocket booster design could fail if challenger was 
launched from the kennedy space center in freezing temperatures 
his concerns were ridiculed by nasa officials then rejected by 
morton thiokol managers 
the space shuttle blew up the next day exactly as boisjoly 
feared 
he believes that despite a costly redesign and testing effort 
the rocket engines still have potentially disastrous weak spots 
to me its just another disaster waiting to happen said 
the 50yearold engineer 
discovery is scheduled to lift off thursday on the first manned 
us space mission since challenger 
nasa and the national research council which has reviewed the 
booster redesign and testing say the new rocket engine is not 
perfect but is much safer than the one that failed with challenger 
challenger was destroyed when pressurized flame leaked from a 
joint between segments in one of the shuttless pair of solidfuel 
rocket boosters touching off an explosion that killed all seven 
astronauts 
in testimony before the rogers commission which investigated the 
accident boisjoly revealed that nasa and morton thiokol knew the 
rocket engines had leaked on past launches and were working toward 
a solution even while continuing shuttle flights 
afterward boisjoly said he was shunned by fellow workers and 
neighbors and morton thiokol put him on the sidelines while work 
started on a redesign of the rocket joint 
when i realized what was happening it absolutely destroyed 
me boisjoly said in a recent telephone interview it destroyed 
my career my life everything else im just now getting back to 
the point where i think ill be able to work as an engineer again 
a doctor said boisjoly was suffering from traumatic stress 
syndrome and the engineer took medical leave from morton thiokol 
later boisjoly named the company in a series of lawsuits that 
sought recovery of 207 billion for himself and the federal 
government the last of the suits was dismissed earlier this month 
by a judge 
in the past year boisjoly has toured the country speaking 
before engineering groups and attacking what he believes is a 
business as usual attitude in nasa and at morton thiokol 
his theme is simple engineers have the obligation to report 
shoddy work or design when they find it because peoples safety is 
at stake but says boisjoly the life of a whistleblower is often 
unpleasant and could be personally disastrous 
they whistleblowers should know that if they do speak out 
against their organization they will pay some sort of a price he 
said 
boisjoly has received major awards from the american association 
for the advancement of science and the institute of electrical and 
electronic engineers for his efforts to stop the challenger launch 
and to make changes in the shuttle rocket design 
the very fact that some people are interested in what i stand 
for has been very encouraging he said 
but boisjoly said he is still looking for work and added sadly 
its not the easiest thing to do to get a new job at 50 years old

the army claims 26 opposition 
activists arrested last week were involved in a plan devised by 
us intelligence agents to overthrow gen manuel antonio noriega 
and send him into exile 
col guillermo wong head of the armys g2 intelligence unit 
presented a document to reporters monday that he said security 
agents discovered during the arrests 
he claimed the sixpage document entitled mission to force 
the departure of general noriega was authored by us officials 
and proved us involvement in efforts to oust noriega 
terrence kneebone a us embassy spokesman dismissed the 
allegation as absurd and said it was designed to divert 
attention from panamas political problems 
the reagan adminstration has imposed economic sanctions against 
panama in a bid to force noriega to resign as commander of the 
defense forces and the countrys de facto ruler noriega was 
indicted in florida last february on charges of trafficking in 
colombian cocaine 
progovernment newspapers originally said 18 people were 
arrested on thursday and friday for alleged involvement in 
clandestine activities but the army said monday that 26 people 
were detained 
wong told reporters the document was the work of the 
intelligence services of the united states and could be found 
inside the us psychological operations manuals he did not 
elaborate 
copies of the document were made available to reporters it 
appeared to be a telefax and was written in spanish 
proposals outlined in the document included making contact with 
potential dissidents within the army and disseminating antinoriega 
propaganda maintaining contact with the foreign press and lobbying 
democratic governments in venezuela and colombia against noriega 
the document bore no identifying stamps seals or signatures 
wong told reporters several weapons were discovered during the 
arrests of the activists but refused to provide details 
lt col nivaldo madrinan director of the armys national 
investigations department said several of those detained had 
confessed to working with reagan administration officials and two 
former panamanian military officers in a bid to undermine the 
government 
he said the two officers identified as lt col eduardo herrera 
and maj cesar villalaz operated out of washington and miami some 
of those arrested illegally left panama on flights from the us 
howard air base in the former canal zone to meet with herrera and 
villalaz and plan strategy madrinan said 
madrinan and wong alleged the 26 detainees belonged to two 
antigovernment groups they identified as the national conformity 
movement and the march 16th active movement 
three detainees present at the news conference told reporters 
they were involved in subversive activity against the government 
one of them jose del carmen serracin is director of the 
authentic panamanian party in the capital reporters were barred 
from asking him questions 
wong said authorities were continuing their investigation and 
that more arrests could be expected 
members of the authentic panamanian and christian democratic 
parties last week rejected charges that those arrested were 
involved in clandestine activities against the government 
this is a method that the regime has used on various occasions 
before against those of us who represent the democratic aspirations 
of the people ricardo arias calderon president of the christian 
democratic party told reporters friday 
federal attorney general carlos villalaz denied charges that the 
detainees had been tortured not one detainee has received 
mistreatment he told the news conference

a us military team seeking to account 
for missing us servicemen flew to laos today to survey sites 
where american planes crashed during the indochina war an official 
said 
the team which departed from bangkok is to survey an area 
around sepone in eastern laos to prepare for possible later 
excavations of the crash sites said maj thomas j boyd spokesman 
for the us pacific command 
the team is from the us joint casualty resolution center and 
army central identification laboratory both honolulubased units 
seeking to account for 2393 americans missing in action from the 
war in vietnam laos and cambodia 
boyd said the team included a marine with special expertise in 
plane crashes 
they will look at crash sites and determine what kind of 
aircraft crashed how it crashed and determine the potential for 
possible future site excavations boyd told reporters 
us losses in that area near the vietnamese border include 
airmen downed in missions to cut off the ho chi minh trail used by 
communist north vietnam to infiltrate troops to usbacked south 
vietnam the war ended with communist victories in all three 
indochinese countries in 1975 
the united states and laos have conducted three previous joint 
crash site excavations most recently in may 
in vietnam meanwhile a us military team was working with 
vietnamese officials on the second day of an unprecedented 
investigation to determine the fates of seven us airmen lost in 
plane crashes near the capital hanoi 
the us team which brought its own interpreters is 
interviewing villagers who witnessed incidents in which the men 
were lost and is seeking evidence such as local government reports 
and human remains 
boyd said the seven are among 70 discrepancy cases those 
in which the united states says there is strong evidence the men 
survived and were taken under vietnamese control the united states 
says it cannot prove any americans are alive in indochina but 
cannot ignore that possibility 
the defense intelligence agency is currently investigating 119 
reports of purported sightings of americans boyd said 
the americans drove to the vietnamese villages monday in jeeps 
they had flown in from honolulu the day before the search is 
scheduled to last about 10 days 
boyd said the two sides may later excavate plane crash sites 
found during the investigation 
previously the only significant joint field activity was in 
late 1985 when us soldiers and vietnamese state workers dug up 
the wreckage of a us b52 bomber just outside hanoi they found 
remains but none were identified as missing americans 
lt col joe harvey leader of the us team in vietnam earlier 
expressed hope for several joint investigation operations in the 
coming months we are prepared to provide four teams if vietnam 
agrees he said 
of the 2393 americans missing 1757 are in vietnam 547 in 
laos 83 in cambodia and six in china us forces withdrew from 
indochina in 1973 after the conflict cost 58000 american lives

the weather in the sunshine state 
could be the critical factor as americas manned space program 
looks to new life thursday with the launching of shuttle discovery 
the potential is there for frequent delays because of tough 
new weather constraints imposed after the challenger disaster 2 
years ago says launch director bob sieck 
never mind hurricanes a stray cloud a stiff wind or a shower 
could ground the shuttle as surely as a mechanical breakdown 
based on historical statistics theres a 60 percent chance we 
will go on schedule mission commander frederick h hauck said 
upon arrival at cape canaveral on monday on a 
rainandlightningdelayed flight from houston 
the bird is ready and were ready said hauck but he 
added were going to keep our fingers crossed on the weather 
the florida peninsula is subject to fastchanging 
sometimesunpredictable storms during the summerautumn changeover 
particularly around this seaside spaceport 
thursdays forecast called for scattered and broken clouds 
widely scattered showers a temperature of 85 degrees and 
southeasterly winds of 1015 knots 
the new restrictions that would ban liftoff include 
moderate rain or other precipitation in either takeoff or 
landing areas 
lightning within 10 miles of the launch pad 30 minutes before 
liftoff 
a temperature below 37 or above 99 degrees fahrenheit 
surface winds 24 knots or 17 knots from the south 
launch managers say stray clouds that drift near the pad from as 
far away as the gulf coast 150 miles away on the other side of the 
peninsula would keep the shuttle grounded there can be no 
lightningproducing clouds within 10 nautical miles of the launch 
site 
cold weather was found to be a key factor in the challenger 
disaster preventing a seal on a right booster rocket joint from 
doing its job of stopping the escape of gases which ignited the 
orbiters main fuel tank 
responsibility for safe launch conditions is in the hands of the 
air weather service detachment at nearby cape canaveral air force 
station it is in constant touch with meteorologists at weather 
facilities all along discoverys planned flight path 
the air force weather watchers rely on sounding rockets that 
gather information in the atmosphere 250000 feet up weather 
balloons carrying instrument packages wind towers lightning 
sensors as far west as the walt disney world area about 50 miles 
away radar antennas that scan the ocean and satellite data 
but man is critical to the system particularly because of the 
volatile conditions in the area said air force col john t 
madura staff meteorologist for the eastern space and missile 
center 
madura has final responsibility for giving a goforlaunch 
signal or aborting the liftoff because of weather conditions 
no constraints go from red to green unless i say so he said

ray bateman jr fixed the family vacuum 
cleaner when he was 3 
now at 14 hes investigating ways to fight cancer a number of 
scientific authorities believe he is on the right track 
bateman braces and all might raise some eyebrows when he 
presents his paper on colon cancer at a clinical research 
conference next month 
but his coresearcher and nextdoor neighbor cancer specialist 
dr glenn tisman said that even if the adolescents voice cracks a 
little few will doubt his competence by the end of his 
presentation 
working with him was like working with a postdoctoral 
fellow tisman said his abilities are remarkable and he was 
full of knowledge about chemistry even though he hasnt ever taken 
a chemistry course in school 
bateman a high school freshman and computer whiz spent more 
than 1300 hours researching the project tisman said 
but hes still a kid basically tisman added my lab 
technician used to complain that ray would leave his candy wrappers 
laying around 
and like a kid bateman is concerned about having to miss two 
days of school but my teachers believe this is a legitimate 
reason to be gone he said and besides this should help me 
get into college 
bateman will travel with tisman to new york to present their 
research oct 7 at an american federation of clinical research 
conference rules dictate that if two authors submit a paper and 
one of them is older than 41 the younger author is the presenter 
tisman is 46 
his being so young will surprise some people tisman said 
but i have confidence in him 
batemans father said his sons accomplishments dont surprise 
him 
when ray jr was 3 years old the vacuum cleaner broke and by 
god he fixed it said the retired civil engineer 
the method tisman and bateman developed will need further 
testing but tisman said it has been effective at his private 
clinic in whittier 
the new therapy is a twist on existing treatment of colon 
cancer tisman said it combines two drugs 5fluorodeoxyuridine 
or 5fudr and leucovorin which kill cancer cells by inhibiting 
replication of dna an essential element in all living matter 
tisman said 
a similar drug 5fluorouracil or 5fu has been used with 
leucovorin to treat certain types of cancer since researchers 
discovered a few years ago that leucovorin increased 5fus 
effectiveness 
but tisman and bateman said their research suggests 5fudr may 
be more effective than 5fu when used with leucovorin 
dr youcef rustum a noted cancer researcher and deputy director 
of the grace cancer drug center at roswell park memorial institute 
in buffalo called the research an important concept in cancer 
chemotherapy 
bateman an only child said most of his free time is spent with 
his computer when he was 11 he attended a computer camp at 
stanford university aimed at high school seniors he has 23000 
worth of computer gear centering on a macintosh ii the fifth 
computer his father has bought him since he was 9 
he just keeps outgrowing them i guess his father said

last respects to carter who was thrust into the national spotlight

billy carters widow sybil and the couples six children were 
seated in front of carters cherry casket which was covered by a 
blanket of exotic flowers and surrounded by dozens of wreaths 
in the crowd were jimmy carter and his wife rosalynn who lived 
next door to billy carter the former president said his 
relationship with his brother strained during his years in the 
white house improved in later years 
we worked together for many years side by side while i was 
president we went in opposite directions but in the last year 
weve just been friends he said 
my mother said never underestimate him the former 
president said he was the most intelligent one in the family 
in delivering the eulogy hall noted that carter had overcome 
many of his own personal problems and was planning to work with 
others overcoming alcoholism 
in 1979 carter spent seven weeks in an alcohol rehabilitation 
program 
he died with courage not to say he went gently into that dark 
night hall said 
in the year since his cancer was diagnosed carter had tried a 
variety of experimental treatments he lived longer than his 
doctors expected 
carter was buried a short distance from the graves of his mother 
miss lillian carter and his father james earl carter

a mexican drug trafficker tied to a murder by 
a strand of hair became the second of three defendants to be 
convicted in the 1985 torture killing of a us drug agent in 
mexico 
rene verdugo urquidez portrayed by prosecutors as the chief 
lieutenant of reputed mexican drug lord rafael caro quintero was 
found guilty monday by a jury that deliberated four days 
the panel was to return today to deliberate further on the third 
defendants guilt or innocence 
the remaining defendant jesus felix gutierrez the 38yearold 
former owner of a los angeles seafood company is charged with 
aiding and abetting caro in his escape to costa rica after the 
killing of drug enforcement administration agent enrique camarena 
and his pilot alfred zavala avelar 
verdugo 36 was convicted of five counts of conspiracy 
kidnapping murder and two counts of violent acts in support of 
racketeering the latter charge is a new statute aimed at 
drugrelated crimes 
the battered bodies of camarena and his pilot were found buried 
at a remote ranch outside guadalajara in march 1985 nearly a month 
after camarena was kidnapped outside the us consulate in the 
mexican city 
the only physical evidence against verdugo was a single strand 
of hair found at caros guadalajara compound where camarena is 
believed to have been killed 
circumstantial evidence came from government informants 
including other drug smugglers who said they heard verdugo discuss 
the camarena killing 
one witness who made a plea bargain with the government told of 
seeing verdugo at the villa the day of the murder he said verdugo 
spoke with another man about a problem they had just solved 
verdugo could be sentenced to life in prison sentencing was set 
for oct 26 
the federal jury convicted former mexican policeman raul lopez 
alvarez in the murders on thursday 
verdugo an admitted drug trafficker and his attorneys sighed 
when us district judge edward rafeedie read the first guilty 
verdict 
defense attorney michael pancer portrayed verdugo as a pawn in a 
political game played by the mexican and us governments he said 
verdugo was sacrificed to close an embarassing case that had 
strained relations between the two countries 
rene is innocent pancer told reporters they flatout 
fooled this jury 
prosecutors witheld comment until after jurors return the last 
verdict prosecutors contend caro ordered the killings as 
retribution for camarenas role in raids on caros marijuana 
plantations they said that verdugo helped in the executions 
evidence showed the agent and pilot were tortured with redhot 
metal pipes and beaten so severely that camarenas skull was 
crushed 
lopez 28 was a member of a mexican state police homicide squad 
in guadalajara at the time his sentencing was set for oct 24 
caro 37 and an associate ernesto fonseca carrillo were 
convicted in mexico last week on narcotics and weapons charges 
caro was sentenced to 34 years and fonseca to 11 years 
nine men were indicted in los angeles but only three were tried 
here one defendant subsequently died four including caro and 
fonseca were tried in mexico on narcotics and murder charges 
verdicts have not yet been reached on some of those charges 
including the murder charges

national centers for disease control researchers 
soon will move into their new hot lab a 20 million 
supersealed laboratory with a 21st century feel to study the 
worlds deadliest viruses 
cdc officials unveiled it monday showing off the secretcode 
passageways air locks decontamination equipment containment 
cabinets and space suits that will be offlimits to all outsiders 
once deadly pathogens are brought in starting next month the 
complex will be formally dedicated oct 28 
for years the center has studied what scientists call level 4 
pathogens mircroorganisms or viruses with the most dangerous 
classification according to deadliness availability of vaccine or 
treatment and risk of transmission in the laboratory 
such agents include ebola hemorrhagic fever lassa fever and 
rift valley fever diseases rarely if ever seen in this country 
and much more hazardous in the lab than aids or rabies said dr 
olen m kew chief of the molecular virology laboratory at the 
center 
the cdcs first facility for the study of such pathogens built 
in 1967 was in a large trailer two larger labs followed 
the new facility officially known as the viral and rickettsial 
diseases laboratory but called the hot lab by those who work 
there will give cdc researchers more space and more modern 
technology than theyve ever had before said dr mike kiley a 
microbiologist with the office of biosafety 
after 10 years the old level 4 lab was beginning to show its 
age kiley said 
this will very much contribute to our overall mission of 
controlling infectious disease around the world said dr 
james m hughes deputy director of the cdcs center for infectious 
diseases 
the laboratory building located at the federal health agencys 
compound near emory university spans more than 95000 square feet 
and is actually two buildings in one a sixstory facility 
containing 12 separate labs and a threestory level 4 facility 
with two separate stateoftheart containment labs connected by a 
central atrium 
the new labs also have intricate waste disposal facilities to 
inactivate then remove any hazardous substances 
walls in the new level 4 facility are poured concrete 9 inches 
thick inside the labs themselves researchers will wear blue 
plastic space suits connected to a safe air supply by red hoses 
which dangle from various points above them 
to enter their lab they will pass through a series of 
increasingly secure checkpoints from the cardkey system which 
opens the outer corridor doors to a secretcode control which 
opens inner doors to heavy submarinestyle steel gasket doors 
opening into a special chemical shower and air lock that in turn 
opens onto the lab 
getting in takes about five minutes getting out takes about 20 
as workers shower first in their space suits with a special 
disinfectant fluid then take showers themselves 
we go out to lunch sometimes but you dont drink a lot of 
coffee in the morning joked research microbiologist luanne 
elliott it takes too long to get in and out

some 34 million us owners of eastman kodak 
cos discontinued instant cameras should get up to 70 in cash and 
coupons just in time for christmas under a new settlement 
i think both sides agree its an excellent settlement said 
burton i weinstein of chicago one of four attorneys who filed the 
classaction lawsuit against kodak saying he was very very 
pleased after mondays decision 
kodak which was forced to stop making instant cameras and film 
after a patent dispute said the settlement is worth 150 million 
but attorneys for camera owners pegged it at more than 200 million 
the settlement approved by cook county circuit judge thomas 
rakowski applies to 39 kodak instant camera models ranging from 
the fiesta the lowestpriced model to the kodamatic 980l the 
most expensive 
weinstein said the cash and coupons would probably be mailed in 
late november in time for christmas shopping 
depending on the cost of their instant camera owners will 
receive amounts ranging from 52 in cash and 18 in coupons to 
1950 in cash and 3050 in coupons 
the coupons accompanied by proof of purchase then can be sent 
to the company for a rebate the coupons could also be used in 
purchasing kodak products such as film cameras or batteries 
from kodaks point of view its good and fair said william 
campbell a chicago attorney representing the rochester ny 
company 
the lawsuit was filed against the company in january 1986 
asking that it compensate owners for instant cameras that were 
virtually useless after a ruling against kodak in its legal battle 
with polaroid corp 
a federal judge in boston said kodak infringed on polaroids 
instantcamera patent when it entered the market in 1976 
instant photography was invented by dr edwin h land founder 
of polaroid and was first marketed in 1948 it enables users to 
view a photographic print shortly after taking a picture 
polaroid retained a monopoly in the instant photography field 
until 1976 when kodak entered the market with a competing system 
polaroid immediately filed a lawsuit charging patent infringement 
a federal judge in boston sided with polaroid and the us 
supreme court let stand lower court rulings when it refused to hear 
kodaks appeal in october 1986

uncounted numbers of teenagers and children 
who this year filed their first tax returns are about to get a 
message from the irs pay your overdue taxes or your bank account 
may be seized 
the internal revenue service weary at being equated with the 
grinch that stole christmas is going out of its way to avoid 
carrying out that threat 
almost six months after the april 15 deadline for filing 1987 
returns the irs is completing a series of mailings to more than 15 
million taxpayers of all ages who filed but failed to pay all or 
part of their taxes 
because as many as 8 million young people were brought onto the 
tax rolls in 1987 the irs believes the number of taxpayers who 
didnt pay up includes many firsttime filers and the agency is 
trying to impress on them the importance of paying up 
we assume these younger taxpayers are not too sophisticated 
about the tax laws and we are trying to make them aware of their 
obligations irs spokesman frank keith said monday 
the young people at risk could be a 1 or 2yearolds with 
interest or dividends on investments given to them or a 
19yearold college student with a parttime job each could have 
become liable for taxes in 1987 because of the big tax overhaul 
enacted a year earlier 
with several million new filers as a result of this new law 
theres no question but that there are some folks who filed returns 
without paying said charles hoyle deputy assistant irs 
commissioner for collections the notices of taxes due are out 
there and were hoping they will contact us and try to resolve this 
without having to resort to any type of collection action 
any taxpayer who files a return on time but fails to pay the 
taxes due is likely to receive one or more comnputergenerated 
notices from the irs there usually is a series of four letters 
three or four weeks apart each sounding a little tougher than the 
last the fourth letter cautions that the irs will take legal 
action to collect the tax unless it is paid within 10 days 
that action hoyle notes can include seizing the bank account 
of a child with interest income or the wages of one who is on a 
payroll 
pastdue bills are subject to 10 percent interest plus a penalty 
that climbs to 1 percent a month after the fourth notice is sent 
under the 1986 law any child must file a return if he or she 
has any combination of earnings and unearned income including 
interest and dividends over 500 the unexpected tax bite on many 
young people comes from another change any child who can be 
claimed as a dependent by a parent is denied a personal exemption 
on his or her own return

the tax evasion trial of real estate magnate 
harry helmsley and his hotel queen wife leona has been delayed 
until early next year because of a legal appeal 
the decision by us district judge john walker on monday was 
unrelated to a defense lawyers claim that the 79yearold helmsley 
suffers from acute memory difficulties 
in a affidavit filed late last week helmsleys attorney john 
wing wrote the judge that his clients memory problems render him 
unable to assist adequately in his own defense 
after examinations by five neurologists and neuropsychologists 
all but one of concluded that mr helmsley has a significant 
memory disability wing said 
wing who sought an indefinite delay of the businessmans trial 
said forcing him to stand trial in his present condition would 
effectively deprive him of his constitutional rights 
walker who has postponed the helmsleys trial twice before 
delayed the case until jan 16 because of a legal appeal by mrs 
helmsley and a court scheduling conflict 
the helmsleys were indicted in april on state and federal 
charges that they allegedly disguised about 4 million in 
renovations to their greenwich conn mansion as business expenses 
and took bogus tax deductions 
the helmsleys and two former aides have pleaded innocent to the 
188count state indictment and the 47count federal indictment 
state prosecutors have agreed to let the federal case go first 
mrs helmsley 67 is appealing walkers denial of her bid to 
dismiss the federal indictment she said she was granted immunity 
from prosecution for her grand jury testimony in an earlier state 
sales tax investigation 
prosecutors say court papers on the appeal could not be filed 
until oct 14 also one of the defense attorneys begins a 
previously scheduled trial on nov 21 before another judge 
walker said an unidentified doctor interviewed and examined 
helmsley over the weekend and expressed some views to me over 
the telephone the judge said he would not rule on the defense 
motion to sever helmsley from the case until he sees the doctors

parliament today named mieczyslaw 
rakowski a longtime foe of the solidarity trade union as the 
countrys ninth prime minister since world war ii 
the choice of party propaganda chief rakowski comes less than a 
month before planned talks between the government and solidarity on 
reinstating the labor federations legal status and reviving 
polands crippled economy 
rakowski a journalist who represented communist authorities in 
198081 talks with solidarity became prime minister by a 3385 
vote with 35 abstentions in a nationally televised parliament 
vote 
the new prime minister immediately asked for two weeks to form a 
new government composed of people with reformist attitudes and 
said he would seek to broaden the communistdominated governing 
coalition 
i want to create a cabinet which will have a broader social 
confidence we are being told move over let others participate 
in actual corule he said 
before the vote polish leader gen wojciech jaruzelski told the 
sejm or parliament that the new government would be open to 
dialogue and economic reform rakowski 61 had been proposed for 
the job by jaruzelski and on monday received the backing of the 
230member communist party central committee 
the party controls the government through its majority in the 
sejm 
in a nominating speech that lasted nearly 30 minutes jaruzelski 
said poland was in a promising period despite its economic 
difficulties and political divisions he referred to upcoming talks 
with the opposition and other representatives of polish society 
to build the future together we all have to change let us 
abandon narrowmindedness the polish leader said 
he said there would be no forbidden topics in the talks but 
said they must have a rational framework that respects the 
constitutional order a phrase used to refer to the dominant role 
of the communist party 
jaruzelski said the new government would be bold and 
effective in dealing with the economy by introducing reforms 
while protecting living standards 
solidarity leader lech walesa expressed hope that rakowskis 
attitudes as prime minister would not be affected by his record as 
an opponent of the banned union movement 
its not important where one comes from walesa said from 
his home in gdansk monday evening whats important is what one 
comes with we hope he will come with pluralism with a 
willingness for reform which is what the country needs 
ryszard bender an independent parliament deputy predicted the 
nomination would not harm the talks with the opposition planned for 
midoctober 
things happening in our country now are so interesting that 
philosophers never even dreamt of them he said things are 
changing fast maybe he rakowski will change his opinion of 
walesa and solidarity too 
rakowski who became the politburo member in charge of 
propaganda in december takes over as prime minister from zbigniew 
messner who resigned sept 19 with his entire cabinet accused of 
mishandling the economy 
i think that rakowski is a skilled man a very good 
politician said ryszard wojna a leader of the sejms communist 
party caucus 
but bronislaw geremek a senior adviser to walesa said what 
matters is whether government policies change if mr rakowski 
brings a political program of a new open policy of dialogue with 
the society then it will be very good 
as prime minister rakowski will face difficult challenges 
confidence in the government has eroded inflation is running at 60 
percent annually consumer goods are in short supply and workers 
are restless after staging two punishing waves of strikes this year 
polands worst labor unrest in seven years ended sept 3 when 
authorities set aside their longstanding opposition to negotiating 
with solidarity walesa agreed to call an end to the strikes after 
the government promised to discuss reinstating the union movement 
then deputy prime minister rakowski became unpopular with 
solidarity activists as the official responsible for negotiating 
with the union movement during its legal existence in 198081 
although he had been a liberal within the party he strongly 
defended the december 1981 military crackdown that suppressed 
solidarity which was banned the next fall 
party secretary wladyslaw baka an economist elevated to the 
politburo in june had been considered a hopeful for the prime 
ministers post 
but bender said rakowski may have been chosen because the party 
wanted someone with a political rather than economic dimension 
and rakowski is a politician 
rakowski served as editorinchief of the party weekly polityka 
from 1958 to 1982 where he gained a reputation as a progressive 
and alienated party hardliners but he was close to jaruzelski 
serving under him as deputy prime minister from 1981 to 1985 
when jaruzelski turned over the prime ministers job to messner 
in november 1985 rakowski also left the government he held a 
largely ceremonial parliament post until gaining a seat on the 
ruling politburo last year

the executive director of the american civil 
liberties union today accused vice president george bush of 
mccarthyite slander against the organization during his 
nationally televised debate sunday night with democrat michael 
dukakis 
the official ira glasser said bushs statement that the aclu 
is involved in a lawsuit seeking to remove the tax exemption of the 
roman catholic church is wrong as is a suggestion that the group 
favors allowing child pornography 
that kind of slur that kind of mccarthyite slander in 
characterizing what the aclu does is outrageous and it does not 
characterize what the aclu is about glasser said on cbs this 
morning 
he referred to the 1950s anticommunist campaign of sen joseph 
mccarthy rwis in which many people were tarred as communist 
sympathizers without proof 
there is a court case challenging the catholic churchs tax 
exemption but the aclu is not involved glasser said he said his 
organization is on record favoring criminal penalties in cases of 
child pornography 
the fact is that we are devoted to only one thing and that is 
the nonpartisan defense of the bill of rights glasser said 
sooner or later everybody needs the aclu when your 
constitutional rights are threatened or violated youll come to 
the aclu 
haley barbour of the bush campaign responded the aclu has a 
wellearned reputation as caring more about criminals rights and 
prisoners rights than they care about victims rights 
on monday aclu president norman dorsen said bush had totally 
twisted the groups positions sunday night as he sought to 
portray dukakis as a liberal outside the american mainstream 
in terms of our daytoday work over many years we have 
consistently acted in a nonpartisan way on behalf of some of the 
most basic principles of the constitution dorsen said our 
positions are mainstream positions 
bush has repeatedly attacked dukakis for being a cardcarrying 
member of the civil liberties union 
in sundays debate he said i dont want my 10yearold 
granddaughter to go into an xrated movie i dont think 
theyre right to try to take the tax exemption away from the 
catholic church i dont want to see the kiddie pornography laws 
repealed i dont want to see under god come out from our 
currency now these are all positions of the aclu and i dont 
agree with them 
dorsen said the aclu does not want 10yearolds to see 
pornographic movies but believes that the movie rating system 
amounts to illegal censorship 
we believe thats a decision that should be made by each 
family he said 
he agreed that the aclu opposes tax exemptions for churches on 
the basis that they amount to a government subsidy of religion he 
stressed that the organizations position applies to all religious 
groups not just the catholic church 
dorsen also took issue with bushs kiddie pornography 
attack saying our view is that the government can prosecute the 
makers of pornography for the improper use of children for this 
purpose we dont feel that the material itself can be censored 
finally dorsen said the aclu has never challenged the use of 
in god we trust on currency although he agreed that such use 
is contrary to the organizations principles 
its not part of the governments job to promote a religious 
belief and the supreme court has said that as far back as 1947 
he said but dorsen said the aclu has never tried to have the words 
removed from currency 
dorsen also pointed out that the organization recently defended 
lt col oliver north saying the government violated his fifth 
amendment rights when it prosecuted him for his role in the 
irancontra affair 
and dorsen said the aclu is about to file a brief in federal 
court in washington on behalf of former white house aide lyn 
nofziger saying he is being improperly prosecuted for illegal 
lobbying

sailing into 
the strait of hormuz under a full moon this us missile frigate 
tried to draw within 900 feet of the supertanker townsend a 
lumbering 294739ton behemoth more than 81 times its size 
the purpose explained the vandegrifts skipper was to see if 
the little warship could snuggle close enough to the tanker so that 
together they would appear as one blip on radar screens in irans 
socalled silkworm alley 
its just something the pentagon wanted us to try said 
cmdr eric utegaard of alexandria va as his ship struggling to 
maintain 17 knots in the churning wake of the townsends 
30footwide propeller 
utegaard could not know last saturday that operation earnest 
will mission no 89 would mark the final time a us warship 
would escort a kuwaiti oil tanker through the persian gulf 
today the first usflagged kuwaiti tanker to sail without a 
close escort of us warships left kuwaits main terminal heading 
south through waters where peace has prevailed since the iraniraq 
ceasefire began aug 20 
although traveling alone the 81283ton oil products carrier 
surf city would not be unprotected should trouble arise during its 
twoday 550mile passage through the gulf and strait of hormuz 
us military sources said 
shes on her way and will be under surveillance at all 
times one source said speaking on condition of anonymity 
while the vandegrift trailed the tanker at a distance for the 
first time since the us convoy escort policy began july 21 1987 
no warship was sailing directly behind it 
however mine fears remain high following reports that italian 
minehunters had found an explosive in the south central gulf the 
third discovered in five days 
the white house announced monday the reduction of tension since 
the iraniraq ceasefire had led president reagan to end the 
tight escort operation 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said us warships will 
continue to be stationed in the gulf prepared to assist any ship 
that might need help the united states now has 26 ships in the 
region 
right to the end the navy was looking for better ways to 
conduct an operation in which its ships had already sailed 50000 
miles escorting convoys through the embattled oil artery 
the long beach califbased vandegrift was the townsends lone 
escort for the voyage northward and earlier had accompanied the 
88th mission a northbound convoy with the 401382ton bridgeton 
famous for hitting a mine during the first earnest will mission 
the bridgetons encounter with a 500pound mine apparently laid 
by the iranians pointed up what us officers such as utegaard say 
is still the single biggest threat in the gulf 
apart from the bridgeton no ship under us escort encountered 
any difficulty with mines missiles aircraft or gunboat attacks 
last oct 16 however an iranian silkworm missile attack 
severely damaged the 81283ton tanker sea isle city at kuwaits al 
ahmadi loading terminal and the ships american master was badly 
wounded 
the ship like the bridgeton later returned to service 
fortysix americans have died in the gulf since shortly before 
the us began escorting ships on may 17 1987 an iraqi fighter 
jet mistakenly fired two missiles into the frigate uss stark 
killing 37 us sailors nine americans died in the gulf after the 
escorts began seven in helicopter crashes and two in the crash of 
a navy plane from a carrier support group in arabian sea 
the cruiser uss vincennes shot down an iranian jetliner in the 
gulf on july 3 killing all 290 people aboard after crewmen 
mistook it for an attacking iranian fighter jet 
although the ostensible purpose of operation earnest will 
was to protect the 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers and underscore a 
us commitment to freedom of navigation officials say it was 
motivated greatly by washingtons concern about growing soviet 
influence in the gulf 
some diplomats noted it was only after moscow agreed to lease 
three tankers to kuwait and give them armed escort protection that 
the united states moved firmly to reflag and escort part of 
kuwaits fleet 
the escort missions proved formidable enough that other foreign 
ships became tagalongs lining up ahead behind or alongside 
the american convoys as they traveled the dangerous waters of 
hormuz and the southern gulf where iranian raiders were most active 
some even painted their sterns with american names to dupe 
iranian gunners into thinking they were part of the reflagged 
kuwaiti fleet

michael dukakis is moving quickly to 
exploit his high points from the presidential debate and distance 
himself from the american civil liberties union 
at a rally monday evening in downtown journal square the 
democratic nominee said that during sunday nights debate his 
republican opponent george bush suggested that i agree with every 
position ever taken by the american civil liberties union 
thats nonsense and he knows it dukakis said 
two months ago i signed one of the toughest child pornography 
laws in the united states of america he said meanwhile his 
staff passed out a fact sheet which said the aclu has urged 
repeal of all child pornography laws 
ive always supported tax exemptions for religious 
institutions said dukakis and i certainly do not support 
oliver north who the aclu is defending 
dukakis membership in the aclu is one of the issues the 
republican nominee has raised in an effort to portray the 
massachusetts governor as a liberal out of the mainstream of 
current thinking 
during the debate bush referred to dukakis as a cardcarrying 
member of the aclu described the group as a liberal organization 
and attacked some of its positions 
i dont want my 10yearold granddaughter to go into an 
xrated movie bush said i dont think theyre right to try to 
take the tax exemption away from the catholic church i dont want 
to see the kiddie pornography laws repealed i dont want to see 
under god come out from our currency now these are all 
positions of the aclu and i dont agree with them 
aclu officials accused bush of distorting the organizations 
positions and engaging in mccarthyite slander aclu president 
norman dorsen said the group has consistently taken mainstream 
positions intended to safeguard constitutional rights 
the dukakis campaign fact sheet said the aclu has represented 
people suing the massachusetts governors administration in an 
effort to overturn its policies on drunk driving road blocks and a 
regulation giving homosexuals low priority when seeking to become 
foster parents 
dukakis campaign officials put together two new television 
commercials showing excerpts from the debate 
one of the 30second commercials shows dukakis talking about 
college opportunity health insurance and concluding the best 
america is not behind us the best america is yet to come 
the second commercial is an excerpt from his closing statement 
people interviewed in focus groups after the debate resppnded very 
favorably to his closing statement 
campaign aides said the commercials would run nationally on the 
major television networks 
at rallies in ohio and new jersey dukakis attacked bush for 
failing to talk about health insurance college opportunity social 
security and medicare 
mr bush offers the easy way said the democratic nominee 
he sees no challenges he offers no solutions and he will lead 
america nowhere as president of the united states 
he was campaigning today in another key industrial state 
illinois with appearances in peoria and melrose park a suburb of 
chicago 
when dukakis landed at newark airport on monday he got a look at 
an airplane he hopes one day will be his to use air force one 
president reagan had flown into the same airport earlier en route 
to address the united nations 
dukakis was taking advantage of the presence of many world 
leaders for the un session 
he was flying to new york on wednesday to meet with soviet 
foreign minister eduard shevardnadze before leaving the city the 
following morning dukakis also planned to meet with french 
president francois mitterand 
the meetings are designed to help him counter arguments by the 
republicans that he lacks foreign policy experience

four simon and simon stunt drivers turned 
into reallife heroes when they chased a man straight to a police 
station after he ran down an officer directing traffic during

samir shamoun 29 of calabasas was arrested monday after the 
angry stunt drivers chased him at speeds up to 70 mph for more than 
a mile to the los angeles police departments west valley station 
its a little ironic said officer frank nuckles this guy 
runs over a blue suit and then he runs to the police station for 
safety 
officer dick neuenschwander 53 was struck while working 
offduty in a restaurant parking lot in the san fernando valley 
police said he was in serious but stable condition at northridge 
hospital 
witnesses said shamoun who worked near the filming site got 
angry when told him he couldnt drive through a parking lot 
bustling with movie people 
shamoun appeared to decide to back up but then the van lurched 
forward police detective don bellante said neuenschwander fell 
while trying to get out of the way and the van ran over his left 
arm and leg 
four members of the simon and simon crew jumped into two 
cars and chased the van as it fled the scene bellante said 
he was getting away with running over a policeman one of 
the crew members gary daily said later thats totally wrong 
one of the cars eventually cut in front of the van forcing it 
to a stop at the curb right in front of the police station 
bellante said all five men ran into the station where officers 
stopped the fracas before anyone was injured bellante said 
they came crashing through the front door of the station with 
this donnybrook going he said officers jumped over the desk 
and grabbed them all until they could sort out who was who and what 
was going on

a former computer programmer on trial 
for 16 murders was described by a prosecutor as a homosexual who 
drove on southern california roads for a decade picking up young 
hitchhikers and drugging strangling and mutilating them 
during his opening statement monday orange county deputy 
district attorney bryan brown pieced together the last hours of the 
men randy kraft is charged with killing most were allegedly 
hitchhikers picked up by kraft in a car stocked with drugs and beer 
this is a road map of what the evidence will show brown 
told a superior court jury 
kraft 43 has pleaded innocent to 16 counts of murder and 
various other counts of mayhem and sodomy his trial was delayed 12 
times since his arrest more than five years ago prosecutors 
believe they can link him to 21 other slayings and say the death 
toll may be as high as 60 
he has been jailed since may 14 1983 when a california highway 
patrol officer stopped him because his car was weaving and found a 
dying marine on the passenger seat 
authorities found what they believe was a coded score card 
of victims in the car and 47 color photographs of several young 
men many of them nude and apparently posed after they were slain 
the evidence shows kraft would bind his drugdazed victims 
choke them with a belt around the neck and have sex with them the 
prosecutor said 
many victims were mutilated before they were heaved from a 
fastmoving car brown said 
krafts fetish for saving mementos of victims and taking 
postdeath photographs was his undoing brown said 
defense attorney c thomas mcdonald who responded to the 
browns twohour statement with a 10minute opening warned jurors 
against being swayed by vivid descriptions of the killings 
these are tactics designed to inflame you mcdonald said 
this is a tactical decision made by the prosecutor he wont be 
able to prove it this case is based on suspicion innuendo and 
prosecutorial rhetoric 
brown detailed the deaths of the 16 victims six of them marines 
and all age 18 to 25 the killings occurred between december 1972 
and may 1983

bishop edward c oleary spiritual 
leader of maines 278000 roman catholics is retiring because of 
declining health a spokesman for the statewide diocese of portland 
said today 
the 68yearold bishop who has headed the diocese since 1974 
planned to make the formal announcement at a news conference at the 
catholic chancery 
olearys decision was prompted by a decline in his overall 
medical condition rather than any specific ailment according to 
marc mutty director of communications for the diocese 
the schedule is just too much for a man of his age mutty 
said he just does not think he can keep up with the pace it has 
demanded 
the announcement followed word from the vatican that pope john 
paul ii had accepted olearys resignation mutty said adding that 
nobody had any inkling of this before this morning 
until a successor is named oleary will serve as apostolic 
administrator of the diocese leaving him in charge but without the 
authority to launch new initiatives according to mutty 
it usually takes three to six months before a new bishop is 
named he said 
a bangor native oleary was educated at holy cross college in 
worcester mass and st pauls seminary in ottawa he was 
ordained a priest in 1946

a jury early today convicted a man 
described by a prosecutor as the head dog in a gang rape and 
recommended that he get the maximum term of 20 years 
jurors deliberated about 20 minutes before returning with a 
recommendation that orlando garza 24 be given the maximum term 
for his part as the alleged ringleader he had also faced a fine of 
up to 10000 but there was no mention of a fine when the jurys 
decision was annnounced 
state district judge ricardo garcia set sentencing for oct 17 
there was little reaction from the defendant after the decision 
was read he declined comment after the court session ended and as 
he left the duval county courthouse with his lawyers 
garza the first of 10 defendants to stand trial in the case 
was accused of being the first man to sexually assault the 
19yearold woman on the night of march 2627 
the woman said as many as 23 men raped her after she was forced 
to go to a ranch where illegal cockfights were being held near this 
town of about 5000 people south of corpus christi 
a counselor who helped the woman at a sex abuse center said she 
telephoned the victim who has moved from here to tell her about 
the jurys verdict shes happy said counselor barbara 
jackson she said thank the lord 
garcia kept the jury late because he said he wanted the panel to 
reach a verdict before he left for a judicial conference in fort 
worth today 
jurors were told they could go home to get some rest and return 
for the punishment phase of the trial but they chose to continue 
defense attorneys urged that garza get probation but the 
assistant district attorney rodolfo gutierrez asked jurors to 
recommend the maximum sentence 
the prosecutor said he believes that some of the other 
defendants might want to plea bargain for shorter prison terms as a 
result of garzas sentence the next trial in the case is scheduled 
for next month 
final arguments began shortly before midnight before a courtroom 
packed with more than 150 spectators jurors began their 
deliberations at 215 am returning the guilty verdict two hours 
later 
to me its devastating that a young woman placed herself in a 
situation where something just extraordinary may have happened 
defense attorney albert pena said in his final argument to the 
sixman sixwoman jury 
she went out there to that cockfight because she wanted to be 
with this man here said defense counsel nago alaniz referring 
to garza 
alaniz said the woman fabricated the kidnapping and gangrape 
story to protect her reputation and keep her husband from finding 
out about her illicit sexual activity with garza who said he had 
been in an affair with the woman since january 
garza on monday said the woman insisted on having sex with him 
that night inside the car and later on the hood of the car and 
that she refused to leave the ranch when he tried to take her home 
all 10 defendants pleaded innocent to charges ranging from 
kidnapping to sexual assault 
but gutierrez said in his final argument that garza was the 
head dog he was the one who brought the meat 
assistant district attorney rocky carrillo told the jury you 
all will have to determine if we have to reside in our county with 
the likes of orlando garza 
the weeklong trial featured testimony by the victim her 
husband and a 12yearold boy present at the cockfight who said 
his family has moved to another city to escape harassment since he 
presented himself as a witness 
he was the only one who was man enough to come up here and 
tell you the truth gutierrez said of the boy while addressing 
the jury today 
garza also faces an aggravated kidnapping trial in the case

arab hospital officials today 
confirmed the first two palestinian deaths from plastic bullets 
and defense minister yitzhak rabin defended the use of the new 
ammunition 
the deaths followed criticism of the armys tactic of allowing 
troops to fire plastic bullets more freely at arab stone throwers 
a united nations relief agency has protested what it said was a 
sharp increase in injuries since the plastic bullets went into use 
rabin said plastic bullets were added to the soldiers arsenal 
in august after rubber bullets tear gas and clubs proved to be 
insufficient to cope with stonethrowing incidents linked to the 
9monthold uprising in the occupied territories 
those who participate in violent activities suffer more 
casualties in terms of wounded he told a news conference at a 
military camp in beit el 12 miles north of jerusalem it did not 
increase the number of people who are killed 
rabin added our purpose is to increase the number of 
wounded among those who take part in violent activities but not to 
kill them 
asked about the un relief and works agency protest rabin said 
his job was to reduce violence in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip other protests with all due respect are of secondary 
importance to me rabin said 
the first confirmed fatalities from plastic bullets were 
identified by hospital officials as osama braikah 17 of khan 
yunis refugee camp and jihad zanoun 27 of gaza city both are in 
the gaza strip 
braikah was hit by two plastic bullets today during a 
demonstration by dozens of stonethrowing protesters in his camp 
said dr ahmed yazejeh of shifa hospital in gaza city one bullet 
hit his face yazejeh said but a plastic bullet to the heart 
killed him 
yazejeh said he received the information from physicians at 
nasser hospital in khan yunis where braikah was declared dead on 
arrival a spokesman at nasser hospital also confirmed the fatality 
was caused by a plastic bullet 
the other victim zanoun died monday after being struck in the 
chest by a plastic bullet during clashes in gaza city according to 
doctors at shifa hospital 
the deaths raised to 276 the number of palestinians killed since 
the palestinian uprising began dec 8 six israelis have died 
violence in the occupied territories monday left two other 
palestinians dead and 67 wounded today at least 10 palestinians 
were wounded in clashes with israeli troops in the west bank and 
gaza eight with plastic bullets and two with live ammunition 
hospital officials said 
army spokesmen have contended plastic bullets which penetrate 
the body with less force than live ammunition are not lethal 
unless fired from less than 20 yards distance 
also today israeli warplanes attacked shiite moslem guerrilla 
bases in south lebanon the army said at least two jet fighters 
took part in the attack on bases belonging to hezbollah an 
iranianbacked shiite faction 
there were no immediate reports on casualties 
the attacks near the lebanese village of alluwayzah appeared to 
be a warning to shiite extremists following the assassinations last 
week of three moderate lebanese leaders 
an army spokesman said the target of todays air raid was 
guerrilla headquarters for planning and executing attacks against 
israeli forces and israelibacked lebanese militiamen in israels 
selfdeclared security zone in southern lebanon 
it was the 15th air strike against guerrilla targets in lebanon 
this year 
israel withdrew the bulk of its troops from lebanon in june 1985 
after a threeyear occupation but maintains a sixto10mile wide 
buffer zone north of the israeli border

michael dukakis refining his plan to break 
the republican electoral college lock plans to curtail his efforts 
in several states that appear out of reach while escalating the 
fight for critical swing states and the major battleground of 
texas according to campaign aides 
in all the states in which dukakis aides concede their chances 
of defeating republican nominee george bush are slim carry roughly 
100 of the 538 possible electoral college votes with 270 needed to 
win the white house 
one dukakis aide speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
campaign would begin pulling back budget and pulling back staff 
and saving the resources for states that are closer to dukakis 
reach 
decisions are being made about every state about where its 
best to schedule visits and where it would be more productive for 
us to be spending time and money another aide said clearly 
there are certain places where we would be better off dedicating 
our resources 
considered high among those is texas with 29 electoral votes 
and where bush currently holds a lead in the polls dukakis and his 
running mate texas sen lloyd bentsen plan an aggressive campaign 
there including ads asking what bush has done for his adopted home 
state and highlighting bentsens texas ties said a third aide 
two of the advisers pointed to dukakis recent travel schedule 
as evidence of the refined strategy and said it was a good 
barometer for states considered competitive 
the governor is committed to a 50state campaign and so are 
we but we all understand what drives a schedule and we are working 
on it together to make the sound strategic decisions said one of 
them 
by that measure most of the south and rocky mountain states 
appear to have been deemphasized 
dukakis has campaigned extensively in texas and will return 
there this week but he has visited florida which has 21 electoral 
votes only once in the past several weeks he has visited 
mississippi and virginia one time each briefly and has not been 
to south carolina dukakis made two stops in alabama several weeks 
ago but has not returned he has not visited georgia since the 
democratic convention in july although he is expected to do so in 
the next few weeks in an effort to keep the race competitive there 
in contrast he has been to arkansas and kentucky at least twice 
since the convention and aides say those states along with 
tennessee north carolina and louisiana are considered more 
competitive as is missouri 
turning west dukakis strategists concede they have little hope 
for carrying traditionally republican alaska utah idaho nevada 
wyoming and arizona as well as kansas and nebraska in the farm 
belt gop vice presidential nominee dan quayles home state of 
indiana and new hampshire 
the dukakis aides say they will not outright concede any state 
but with six weeks to go before the election must make decisions 
on where best to allocate staff and money if internal tracking 
shows a significant shift among voters in any of the states now 
being deemphasized the plan could again be revised the aides 
said 
we track this stuff very carefully and will be ready to 
respond if we see a new opportunity somewhere said one aide 
involved in targeting decisions by keeping it competitive if we 
can we keep the republicans spending time and resources you see 
where we are by looking at the schedule but that doesnt mean we 
dont keep targets of opportunity open 
if paid staffers are relocated the campaign will rely on 
volunteers to maintain a presence in all 50 states that aide said 
the current plan is to target two of the largest electoral 
prizes california and texas and the traditionally democratic 
states in the northeast and industrial midwest the race in many of 
those states is very tight another factor in decisions to 
reallocate resources the aides said 
new york which ranks second only to california in electoral 
votes new jersey massachusetts rhode island connecticut 
maryland pennsylvania ohio illinois and michigan carry a total 
of 179 votes and dukakis hopes to win most of them and offset any 
losses with victories in the border states 
despite the decision to deemphasize some states dukakis aides 
are convinced they can break the gop electoral lock by reclaiming 
the northeast and industrial midwest and picking up the rest of the 
needed votes from other states that supported president reagan in 
the last two elections 
whether its in the border states or the far west its clear 
that its very different this time said one aide the 
opportunity is clearly there

president reagan asked about a firefight 
involving guerrillas and us military advisers in el salvador 
said today he would never deny the advisers the right to defend 
themselves 
in the incident two weeks ago the us advisers to the 
salvadoran army found themselves in the middle of a rebel attack on 
an army headquarters the pentagon said 
maj kathy wood a pentagon spokeswoman said that the advisers 
fired in self defense and that none was injured 
they were caught in the middle of a fire fight and their own 
lives were in jeopardy so they fired in self defense she said 
reagan asked about the incident during a picturetaking session 
with nato leaders in new york replied ill never send any of 
our people into danger without allowing them the right to defend 
themselves if they are attacked 
the washington post and the miami herald in editions today 
quoted a defense department memorandum as saying 16 salvadoran 
soldiers and five guerrillas were killed in the assault at the 
salvadoran armys 4th brigade headquarters in north central el 
salvador 
here is how the memorandum described the action according to 
the published reports 
during the attack the us personnel positioned themselves in 
a sandbagged and reinforced bunker position adjacent to the trainer 
quarters from this position the us personnel could observe 
guerrillas moving about surrounding high ground and firing their 
weapons at or in the general direction of the us personnel 
perceiving a direct threat to their safety the us personnel 
engaged the guerrillas with their assigned personal weapons 
it was not known specifically whether the three us soldiers 
killed anyone they reportedly returned fire with m16 rifles 
there are no indications of guerrilla casualties as a result 
of the us defensive fire the post quoted lt gen charles w 
brown director of the defense security assistance agency as 
writing in the memo 
the encounter occurred sept 13 but word of it surfaced monday 
because the defense department referred to it in a report it is 
required to send to congress whenever a hostile action in el 
salvador involves an american the spokeswoman said monday 
she said she had not seen the memo referred to in the published 
reports 
the same salvadoran army headquarters was the site of a fierce 
gun and mortar battle in late march 1987 resulting in the death of 
a us army sergeant 
army sgt gregory fronius 27 an intelligence specialist who 
was advising the salvadoran army is the only soldier reported 
killed while on duty in the midst of combat during the eight years 
of civil war in the country us military advisers arrived in the 
country in 1981 
fronius was one of two advisers assigned to the camp at the time 
of the 1987 attack the other us soldier was away

health industry officials fear that the 
high failure rate of people who took the national nursing exam in 
july foretells a worsening in an already serious nursing shortage 
were in a real bind said bill massie chief operating 
officer of the university of kentuckys albert b chandler medical 
center where 29 of 73 nursing graduates hired over the summer 
failed the test 
nursingschool graduates can work as registered nurses until 
their test results arrive but those who fail lose their positions 
nationally 164 percent of individuals who took the twoday 
exam for the first time in july failed said carolyn yocom 
director of research services for the national council of state 
boards of nursing which prepares the exam 
partly because of changes in the test and the way it is scored 
that is the highest failure rate since the council started the exam 
in 1982 she said last year only 9 percent of firsttime test 
takers failed and in previous years the failure rate ranged from 8 
percent to 12 percent yocom said 
the failure rate increased in all 50 states she said in 
kentucky then failure rate was about 20 percent of firsttime test 
takers up from 10 prcemt last year said patricia calico 
president of the kentucky board of nursing 
this just exacerbates the shortage problem said michael 
rush vice president for member services of the kentucky hospital 
association a survey it did in 1987 found that one in 10 
registerednurse positions in kentucky hospitals was unfilled 
the uk medical center has closed three intensivecareunit beds 
because it didnt have enough nurses massie said 
carolyn a williams dean of the university of kentucky school 
of nursing said she worries that the bad results will scare young 
people away from a nursing career 
this years test has been changed to cover new subjects because 
of the changing skills and knowledge required of entrylevel 
nurses yocom said 
also the number of correct answers needed to pass the test was 
increased but by fewer than 10 out of the total of 300 questions 
asked she said the chicagobased council wont reveal how many 
correct answers are needed to pass the test 
yocom said the council expected the failure rate to increase 
but not by as much as it did and said changes in the exam 
accounted for only half the increase 
she theorized that increasing opportunities for women in other 
professions night and weekend hours in many healthcare settings 
and noncompetitive salaries have prompted fewer topquality people 
to enter nursing 
the kentucky board of nursing has asked the national council to 
offer the exam three times a year instead of the current two so 
nurses can get into the work force more quickly the next scheduled 
exam is in february and by the time those results come out the 
nurses who failed in july but pass in february will not be able to 
start work as registered nurses until about april

security forces found a large 
arsenal of weapons including a sovietmade rocket launcher hidden 
in underground bunkers police said today 
the royal ulster constabulary said a number of people were 
arrested for questioning about the caches discovered on monday and 
today around strabane county tyrone near northern irelands 
northwest border with the irish republic 
security forces have found a huge arsenal of terrorist 
weapons a police statement said 
the haul included a soviet rpg7 rocket launcher and two 
warheads more than 1000 pounds of homemade explosives two 
sovietmade akm assault rifles one shotgun a large quantity of 
ammunition and detonators explosive fuses and propellant charges 
police said 
the arms were concealed in 40gallon drums that had been welded 
together and buried in elaborately constructed bunkers under a 
hillside police said 
it is obvious that people within our community were fully 
aware of the presence of these caches said a police spokesman 
who requested anonymity where human life is being taken so 
frequently it is long past time that those who are aware of such 
activity should act more responsibly 
the spokesman urged citizens to report any information about 
terrorist activities or arms so that lives can be saved 
last week sir john hermon head of the royal ulster 
constabulary said the outlawed irish republican army has very 
considerable quantities of very powerful weaponry which they have 
not yet used including surfacetoair missiles 
libya is believed to have supplied the weapons to the ira for 
its fight to oust the british from protestantdominated northern 
ireland and unite the province with the mainly roman catholic irish 
republic 
this year a series of ira attacks in northern ireland mainland 
britain and continental europe have killed 27 british soldiers and 
11 guerrillas since november 20 civilians have died in bungled 
ira operations

laboratory studies suggest chemicals that 
tantalize the sweet tooth may actually help prevent cavities says 
a chemist who hopes to develop a toothprotecting sugar substitute 
the chemicals are derived from table sugar and are called 
glucans mimics because they imitate glucans a sticky substance 
that is the major component of plaque which adheres to teeth to 
cause cavities 
laboratory studies showed that the chemicals took the place of 
real glucans to block the plaqueforming activity of enzymes 
produced by bacteria found in the human mouth university of 
louisville chemist k grant taylor said monday during the american 
chemical societys national meeting 
although the chemicals havent yet been tested in animals or 
people and are not yet able to permanently block the cavitycausing 
enzymes similar substances might be developed for use in 
commercial toothpaste and mouthwashes that would probably take 
about eight years under the best circumstances taylor said 
if an intensely sweet plaquepreventing compound can be 
developed you can use it as a sugar substitute he said 
an american chemical society news release called taylors 
research a major step toward preventing cavitycausing dental 
plaque but other scientists were more cautious 
its basic research and we cant tell how long before 
something may come to fruition said dr joseph ciardi a cavity 
research program administrator at the national institute for dental 
research in bethesda md 
this is all testtube work said dr erwin barrington 
periodontics professor at the university of illinois school of 
dentistry in chicago something that works in the lab isnt 
necessarily going to work on an animal be it a human or laboratory 
animal 
the method now used to stop plaque from causing cavities is to 
remove the material by brushing and flossing teeth and using mouth 
rinses to help break down plaque to ease removal barrington said 
bacteria in the mouth use their own enzymes and sugar in food to 
make glucans more food particles and bacteria then stick to the 
glucans to form plaque sugars in the food are converted to acid 
which dissolves tooth enamel and damages material beneath the 
enamel to create cavities 
taylor said his studies focused on finding or making glucans 
mimics which are artificial forms of glucans 
in the testtube experiments glucans mimics hooked onto the 
decaycausing bacteria preventing real glucans from doing so 
taylor said that prevented the bacteria from making chemicals that 
give plaque its structure he said 
taylor and his colleagues said they have found or developed 
different chemicals that mimic glucans they include synthetic 
chemicals derived from table sugar hydrogen peroxide and vitamin 
b6 
glucansmimicking chemicals also are a lot more expensive than 
flouride which is fairly effective in reducing cavities he 
said if scientists develop such chemicals that prevent plaque in 
humans they may be economical only for people who suffer a 
condition in which flouride harms rather than protects their teeth 
taylor added 
the chemistry group said americans now spend about 16 billion a 
year for the diagnosis and treatment of cavities

police detained a methodist 
minister today in an early morning raid claiming he violated a ban 
on calls for an election boycott his wife and church colleagues 
said 
the rev tom mbanane of soweto was taken into custody as the 
methodist and roman catholic churches released the text of pastoral 
letters urging their followers to consider refusing to vote in the 
oct 26 nationwide municipal elections 
agnes mbabane said her 55yearold husband was taken from his 
home in the black township at 1245 am by officers who alleged he 
had preached against participation in the october elections 
mrs mbabane said her husband had not advocated an election 
boycott but had conveyed the methodist churchs appeal to its 
congregations to consider carefully whether they should vote 
mbabane is a regional vice chairman of the methodist church the 
chairman of his district the rev peter storey said in a 
statement the authorites must have taken leave of their senses 
to remove someone of mr mbabanes stature and integrity from 
soweto at this tense time 
the pastoral letter from methodist leaders said abstention from 
voting would be the only way for some voters to convey their 
rejection of apartheid 
only candidates who are openly and sincerely committed to the 
complete abolition of apartheid are worthy of christian support 
the letter said 
a similar letter issued by the southern african catholic bishops 
conference said the elections could further entrench apartheid 
the elections will mark the first time south africans of all 
races go to the polls the same day most antiapartheid activists 
oppose participation in segregated local elections as long as the 
black majority is excluded from full participation in national 
elections 
numerous activist clergymen including anglican archbishop 
desmond tutu have defied a stateofemergency regulation 
forbidding calls for an election boycott 
stateofemergency regulations in effect since 1986 restrict 
reporting about unrest security force actions treatment of 
detainees some forms of protest and a range of statements the 
government considers subversive enforcement of the regulations has 
not been comprehensive 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the 
26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs the 5 million 
whites control the economy and maintain separate districts schools 
and health services

republican george bush boasted today that 
hes successfully pasted a liberal label on democratic rival 
michael dukakis and declared that im going to keep on using it 
in their tight campaign race for the white house 
bush also told several thousand students at a young college 
republicans rally on the university of miami campus that dukakis is 
inexperienced in foreign affairs 
america doesnt need a president who has to enroll in foreign 
policy 101 to understand the kind of world we live in the vice 
president said 
bush asked how did i do in his nationally televised debate 
with dukakis on sunday and the reply was a roar of approval from 
the crowd 
about three dozen protesters waving produkakis signs and 
chanting where was george were kept several hundred feet away 
and out of earshot from the platform where the gop nominee spoke 
bush said he was successful in portraying dukakis during the 
debate as a liberal who stands far to the left of most americans 
we smoked him out he said 
for most of the campaign the man i call the stealth candidate 
has tried to hide where he stands bush said 
the vice president said dukakis didnt like it when bush used 
the big l word referring to the word liberal im going to 
keep on using it bush said 
hes just itching to spend money and he wants to set the clock 
back to those days of misery and malaise and im not going to let 
him do it bush said 
expanding on that theme the vice president criticized the 
massachusetts governor monday for his membership in the american 
civil liberties union during campaign stops in the south 
aides said bush would drive the point home today on a tour that 
also took him to a republican convention in columbus ohio and a 
rally at owensboro ky bush planned wednesday to take an 
eighthour bus trip through illinois 
my values are your values and they are not the values of the 
aclu bush told a rally and barbecue on monday at a farm in 
hampton ga near atlanta 
he spoke as dukakis at a campaign appearance in jersey city 
said he did not agree with all positions taken by the civil 
liberties organization and he bush knows it 
dukakis stressed his support for tough laws against child 
pornography his support for tax exemptions for churches and other 
charitable organizations and his opposition to the aclus support 
of former white house aide oliver north a key figure in the 
irancontra scandal 
bush aides voiced delight with what they viewed as dukakis 
squirming on the issue my advice to him is make my day come 
south said bush campaign manager lee atwater predicting the 
aclu issue would loom even larger in the days to come in the south 
and other conservative rural areas 
meanwhile bush says he thinks his sunday night showdown with 
the democratic presidential nominee was probably a draw 
contradicting an array of senior aides who crowned him the clear 
victor 
i kind of thought it was even bush told reporters 
however he also said he thought the debate turned out pretty 
well 
at a joint appearance in jackson tenn with gop vice 
presidential candiate dan quayle bush voiced strong praise for his 
running mate and urged supporters to stay tuned for next weeks 
vice presidential debate in which he predicted quayle would do well 
quayle declared bush the winner of the debate which he called 
the nice man versus the ice man and said dukakis would have 
been better off to take advice from his friends at the aclu and 
exercised his right to remain silent 
over and over bush and his lieutenants drove home the aclu 
issue 
in particular bush in his georgia speech accused the 
organization of opposing penalties for distributing child 
pornography and of advocating the legalization of drugs including 
crack and heroin 
i dont think that is the american way bush said it is 
not my way it is the way of the aclu 
in the same speech bush said that to wrap up that democratic 
nomination he dukakis had to stay where hes been in his entire 
political life and that is on the left side of things and now 
hes trying to move back and preempt the mainstream in the 
middle 
i will not let him do that im going to make him be what he 
is not what he wants to be bush added

aung gyi a retired army officer who broke 
with strongman ne win and became the countrys leading dissident 
today was named chairman of a newly formed opposition alliance 
the alliance urged workers to continue a general strike until 
they achieved their goal of democracy the strike began sept 18 
when gen saw maung seized power in a military coup 
in another development the government said today that 348 
people had been killed in burma since the coup western diplomats 
in rangoon estimated earlier that as many as 400 people were killed 
by the government in the days following the coup 
government spokesman kyaw sann told a press briefing that 219 
others had been wounded and 1107 arrested by authorities 
widespread rioting broke out when saw maung seized power and 
the general immediately ordered troops into the streets to quell 
the protests 
the government spokesman also said rebels of the burma communist 
party have launched major attacks against army outposts in 
northeastern burma killing 44 government soldiers and wounding 92 
the fighting said to be continuing in some areas involved both 
government air strikes and fierce infantry clashes with bayonets 
the spokesman for the opposition alliance said another former 
military officer tin oo was named vice chairman of the league for 
democracy while aung san suu kyi daughter of a revered burmese 
independence hero was chosen general secretary 
the three figures formed the league saturday and immediately 
called on all citizens to join in a peaceful struggle against the 
new military regime 
the alliance marks the first formal opposition attempt to unify 
under one leadership the millions of students buddhist monks 
workers and professionals who have taken to the streets over the 
past two months to demand an end to 26 years of repressive 
oneparty rule 
the new opposition league demands than an interim government be 
created to lead burma out of chaos 
we still believe that an interim government is the only way to 
solve the present crisis in the country to revive stalled 
government to reactivate the brokendown economy and to hold 
genuine free and fair general elections aung gyi said today 
the alliance also named nine members of a 12member executive 
committee the three remaining positions are to be filled later by 
representatives of burmas numerous ethnic minorities who are also 
fighting the government 
the alliance later will elect a 37member governing body which 
will include one representative from each of the seven states where 
ethnic minorities predominate arakan chin kachin shan kayah 
karen and mon 
the 70yearold aung gyi earlier this year circulated a series 
of letters to former leader ne win criticizing the governments 
economic performance and its brutal suppression of student 
demonstrations last march 
aung gyi who broke with ne win in 1963 over economic policy 
was jailed for several years in the 1960s and again briefly this 
summer when hardliner sein lwin assumed power after ne win resigned 
tin oo 61 was removed by ne win as defense and army chief in 
1976 and was later jailed in connection with an alleged 
antigovernment plot 
aung san suu kyi 42 is the daughter of the late aung san the 
much revered hero of burmese independence from great britain she 
had been living in britain but returned to rangoon for a visit 
earlier this year and stayed to campaign for democracy 
analysts say the three who had trouble cooperating in the past 
were pressed to unite by the bloody crackdown on dissent following 
saw maungs coup 
since the coup demonstrations have ceased in rangoon and some 
students have fled to the rugged frontier with thailand to seek 
refuge with ethnic minority insurgents 
on monday top officials appealed to parents and teachers to 
stop the students from linking up with the rebels

canadian ben johnson left the olympics 
today in a complete state of shock accused of cheating with 
drugs in the worlds fastest 100meter dash and stripped of his 
gold medal the prize went to american carl lewis 
many athletes accepted the accusation that johnson used a 
musclebuilding but dangerous and illegal anabolic steroid called 
stanozolol as confirmation of what they said they know has been 
going on in track and field 
everybody uses drugs said sprinter horace doveedwin of 
sierra leone give me a break they have everything human 
blood hormone all kinds of drugs steroids is nothing anymore it 
is just an ittybitty drug you can get it anywhere 
redeyed and visibly distraught johnsons sister clare rodney 
in suburban toronto refused to believe the accusation 
if you could cut him into a million pieces and test him over 
again my brother is not on drugs she said 
two tests of johnsons urine sample proved positive and his 
denials of drug use were rejected today 
neither a spiked sarsparilla in his track bag as his coach 
suggested nor a switched sample at the lab could have accounted 
for the levels of steroids found in the tests officials said 
in a middleofthenight meeting with olympic and canadian 
officials family members coach and manager johnson 26 
forfeited his most prized possession the medal hed had in his 
hands for only three days 
the worlds fastest human also was automatically suspended from 
international competition for two years and banned from canadas 
national team for life 
he appeared to be in a complete state of shock and not 
comprehending the situation said canadas chief of mission 
carol anne letheren ben was not able to discuss or articulate 
anything at that moment he was just not able to speak and it 
was a very difficult moment for all of us 
a few hours later he fled to the airport and boarded a plane to 
new yorks kennedy international airport once there he made his 
way through a crush of reporters without comment as some spectators 
applauded he took a limousine to laguardia airport for a flight to 
his toronto home 
this is a blow for the olympic games and the olympic 
movement said international olympic committee president juan 
antonio samaranch 
in canada prime minister brian mulroney said the scandal was a 
personal tragedy for ben and his family its also a moment of 
great sorrow for all canadians 
james worrall a canadian member of the ioc said johnson has 
been killed as an athlete he said the sprinters oncefavored 
status as a hero to many sports fans in canada his native jamaica 
and around the world now will be tarnished 
johnsons name will go down in olympic history with other 
athletes who lost their gold medals such as decathlete jim thorpe 
in 1912 because he played semipro baseball and swimmer rick demont 
in 1972 because he took an asthma medicine 
lewis did not gloat over his rivals fall i feel sorry for 
ben and for the canadian people he said today ben is a great 
competitor and i hope he is able to straighten out his life and 
return to competition 
he said he did not want to fuel this controversy by 
commenting further 
after saturdays race though lewis had said he couldnt 
understand how johnson could run as fast as he did after looking 
tired in qualifying heats lewis has previously alleged widespread 
drug use in track and field 
dr robert dugal a canadian member of the ioc medical 
commission called stanozolol one of the most dangerous anabolic 
steroids it has the effect of leading to a number of disturbances 
of the liver including cancer

a federal judge ruled that an american 
indian accused of hostagetaking must act as his own attorney a 
decision the mans lawyer called a disgrace 
eddie hatchers trial opened monday but his lawyer william 
kunstler was in new york at a trial expected to last until 
midoctober 
the court is ready to proceed and will proceed with this 
trial us district court judge terrence boyle said after 
hatcher declined to be represented in court by two attorneys other 
than kunstler 
mr hatcher has chosen to defend himself boyle announced 
no your honor i have had that decision forced on me against 
my constitutional rights hatcher replied 
jury selection in the trial continued today by midmorning 
boyle had questioned 43 jurors and excused 15 including two who 
said they were unalterably in favor of hatcher and the trials 
other defendant timothy jacobs both potential jurors said they 
had some american indian ancestry 
hatcher 31 and jacobs 20 are charged with taking up to 20 
hostages and possessing illegal firearms in a 10hour siege at the 
robesonian newspaper office feb 1 in lumberton 
the hostages were released unharmed when gov jim martin agreed 
to appoint a state task force to investigate the defendants 
allegations of drug trafficking and racial discrimination among 
county law enforcement officials no evidence of drug trafficking 
has been found 
the trial opened with jacobs at one table with his three lawyers 
and their two staff members while hatcher sat alone at another 
table 
before jury selection could start a chapel hill law professor 
who is counseling hatcher barry nakell argued that the trial 
should be delayed until kunstler a prominent attorney known for 
his defense of leftist causes could be in the courtroom 
boyle denied the request then the federal judge ruled that an 
associate of kunstlers who was present stephanie moore would be 
hatchers trial attorney despite ms moores argument that she was 
representing hatcher only before the 4th us circuit court of 
appeals 
ms moore refused to participate in the trial and walked out of 
the courtroom just before the lunch recess in court after the 
break boyle asked hatcher if he would accept either ms moore or 
nakell as his trial attorney 
mr hatcher do you want to fire mr nakell or keep him 
boyle asked hatcher replied bill kunstler is my attorney and i 
feel like im being forced to make this decision and my 
constitutional rights are being violated 
kunstler criticized the federal judge saying it was a 
disgrace for a federal judge to deny a defendant the counsel of 
his choice and calling the decision a wicked and misleading 
charade

the soviet union today called on the 
united states to join moscow in creating a world space 
organization which would use a disputed siberian radar base as its 
eye on the heavens 
soviet leader mikhail gorbachev suggested earlier this month 
that the soviet radar base at krasnoyarsk siberia be turned over 
to an international agency for the peaceful exploration of space 
the united states says the radar base violates the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty and must be demolished 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said in his 
speech today to the general assembly that the united states should 
join the soviets in the space agency and donate us radar units in 
greenland and britain 
shevardnadze said the latest soviet diplomatic initiative was 
sincere and that he wanted to make the united nations a unique 
global center for ensuring universal and regional security and the 
security of each country 
the western allies which regard the soviet proposal as a new 
organizational plan that would replace the un charter are 
reluctant to tinker with the existing structure of the world body 
last year the soviets were unable to win a majority of votes in 
the general assembly when they introduced the plan as a resolution 
shevardnadze also said the ussoviet treaty to scrap all 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles should be supplemented by an 
agreement limiting the spread of military missile technology that 
could be worked out only under the auspices of the united 
nations 
on conventional arms the soviet diplomat suggested the united 
nations register all conventional arms sales and transfers 
shevardnadze called for an expanded role for the security 
council suggesting periodic meetings of its foreign ministers and 
that it meet in areas of regional tensions 
in the last 18 months increased ussoviet cooperation has 
allowed the security council to act unanimously on major issues 
including the persian gulf peace plan in resolution 598 and in 
denouncing the use of chemical weapons in the gulf war 
turning to afghanistan shevardnadze said the geneva accords 
are not just an isolated local instance of a regional conflict 
settlement they are a new promising beginning in world 
politics attesting to a qualitative change in poltiical thinking 
under those unmediated accords soviet troops are to be out 
of afghanistan by feb 15 in a withdrawal that began may 15 
shevardnaze also called on the united states and other nations 
to join the soviets in abolishing some planned or ongoing military 
programs and channel the funds toward setting up an international 
system of environmental security 
shevardnadze also acknowledged president reagans speech monday 
in which the president noted ussoviet cooperation had 
contributed to breakthroughs in regional security 
here i can only agree with president reagans remrks yesterday 
about the beneficial impact of sovietamerican political dialogue 
on that process he said 
on monday reagan delivered a mostly conciliatory upbeat 
farewell speech before the world body he had in the past chastised 
for its alleged antiwestern attitudes 
the president condemned the use of outlawed chemical weapons in 
the persian gulf war and called for a new global ban on such 
warfare 
he indirectly criticized iraqs use of poison gas against its 
kurdish minority and against iranians kurdish rebels have long 
been fighting for a separate homeland in northern iraq and sided 
with iran during the war 
reagan called on all nations to convene a conference that would 
consider ways to enforce the 1925 protocol barring chemical weapons 
in international conflicts he also urged nations to cooperate in 
negotiating a verifiable global ban on chemical weapons at the 
conference on disarmament in geneva 
reagan praised the united nations for negotiating a ceasefire 
in the 8yearold iraniraq war and for opening talks to formalize 
a peace treaty 
he said us and soviet negotiators were making steady progress 
on an accord to halve the superpowers longrange or strategic

canadians by winning the 100meter dash at the olympics again drew 
an outpouring of emotion from his adopted land after he was 
stripped of his gold medal for using drugs 
it puts a dent in canada said scott shaw a 10th grader in 
calgary alberta 
canadians watched the jamaicanborn johnson shoot to a 
979second world record in the 100meter race saturday and win 
canada its first gold medal in seoul 
but today a disappointed nation awaited the return of the burly 
sprinter after a urine sample was found to contain traces of 
anabolic steroids johnson who was disqualified from the olympic 
games on monday and stripped of the gold medal was to return to 
toronto this afternoon 
prime minister brian mulroney who saturday thanked johnson for 
the thrill of a lifetime in a nationallytelevised telephone 
call to seoul said his disqualification was a moment of great 
sorrow for all canadians 
calling the incident a national embarrassment sports 
minister jean charest said johnson will be banned from canadas 
national team for life 
a few days ago canada had the opportunity of having a great 
day of national pride charest told reporters he said his 
government accepted the validity of the tests and the suspension 
would be effective pending an appeal from johnson 
johnson knew what the rules were said charest who 
acknowledged he had heard several months ago that johnson might be 
using steroids 
from time to time people would come to me in a private way 
and this happened one or two times that maybe ben johnson is 
using steroids or other drugs charest said adding that the 
sprinter was aware he would be tested at the olympics 
i dont believe he did it on purpose he hasnt got the guile 
to do that said fergus kilmartin 36 of coquitlam british 
columbia i feel terribly sad for him 
some canadian athletes expressed sympathy for johnson 
mike sokowski a teammate at the 1984 olympic games in los 
angeles said bens a pretty simple guy ben does not do drugs

but canadian speedskater gaetan boucher judged the sprinter 
harshly saying he has no respect for an athlete who takes 
drugs boucher won two gold medals at the 1984 winter games in

a grand jury has decided that tawana brawley 
whose case brought allegations of a racist coverup fabricated her 
story that she was gang raped by white men the new york times 
reported today 
the special state grand jury found overwhelming evidence that 
the black 16yearold wappinger falls girl lied and helped create 
the condition in which she was found possibly because she feared 
she would be beaten at home the newspaper said 
the evidence was assembled over seven months by a grand jury 
that was unable to obtain testimony from miss brawley who was 
found nov 28 smeared with feces dazed and with racial slurs 
written on her body 
her story attracted national attention prominent people who 
spoke sympathetically of her plight included heavyweight boxing 
champion mike tyson and actor bill cosby who put up a 25000 
reward 
civil rights organizations cited the case as an example of 
racism and unfairness in the criminal justice system while miss 
brawley refused to cooperate with investigators and the grand jury 
an adviser to the brawley family the rev al sharpton 
criticized the times report today calling it nothing but a whole 
succession of reckless speculations that are not backed up with one 
iota of fact 
the times said that more than 100 witnesses and exhibits 
including confidential medical and police reports and secretly 
taped telephone conversations were considered by the grand jury 
which was empaneled in poughkeepsie on feb 29 
the newspaper said the grand jury was expected within weeks to 
issue a final report saying it has found no evidence of any 
abduction racial or sexual attack or any other crime against miss 
brawley 
miss brawley has moved with her family to virginia beach va 
where she is attending high school their telephone number is 
unpublished and neither the times nor the associated press could 
reach the family for comment 
miss brawleys mother glenda defied a subpoena in june and was 
sentenced to 30 days in jail but avoided the sentence by taking 
refuge in churches and finally leaving the state 
the grand jury also subpoenaed miss brawley but has abandoned 
hope of ever hearing her story firsthand and rescinded its vote to 
subpoena her the poughkeepsie journal reported today 
miss brawleys other two advisers lawyers c vernon mason and 
alton maddox could not be reached for comment masons phone went 
unanswered while a message left at maddox residence was not 
immediately returned 
the advisers have alleged a coverup by white officials who 
refuse to prosecute whites for raping a young black 
the times said the grand jury specifically will clear steven a 
pagones a dutchess county assistant prosecutor as well as other 
law enforcement officials whom brawley advisers have accused of 
participating in the alleged attack 
the grand jury concluded that contrary to the teenagers claim 
that she was abducted nov 24 she had chosen not to return home 
and hid for the next four days in a nearby apartment from which her 
family had recently been evicted the times said 
it said she possibly with the help of an accomplice smeared 
herself with dog feces wrote racial slurs on her body tore and 
scorched her clothes and crawled into a garbage bag and pretended 
to be in a traumatized daze the newspaper said 
for weeks she misled doctors social workers police reporters 
and concerned community people with medical complaints and false 
and fragmentary accounts of her fabricated episode of horror and 
then refused to cooperate to cover up her actions the times 
reported based on the grand jury findings 
the grand jury speculated that she may have feared her mothers 
boyfriend for her late nights out and that drugs and her 
relationships with shady characters may have played a role the 
times said 
mrs brawleys boyfriend ralph king had a history of violence 
the newspaper said including serving seven years in jail for 
killing his wife in 1970 the grand jury said there was evidence he 
had beaten miss brawley and that mrs brawley had also beaten her 
daughter

gov james r thompson is asking the legislature 
for changes in chicago school reform legislation that would among 
other things give him more power over a board that is to oversee 
the reform process 
the governor says his proposed changes in the legislation would 
further the bills goal of shifting power to the local school level 
thompson signed the legislation monday in an amendatory veto a 
procedure under illinois law in which a bill is sent back to the 
legislature for consideration of the governors written changes or 
amendments 
the legislation radically reforms the administrative structure 
in chicago in terms of budgeting and planning thompson said in a 
statement i believe that the changes suggested today will make 
this bill stronger and that a majority of people throughout the 
city and state agree with me 
some legislative supporters of the bill said they could accept 
thompsons suggestions 
but chicago teachers union president jacqueline vaughn raised 
objections to changes that would affect some teachers seniority 
rights and some black lawmakers took issue with the proposed 
expansion of the governors power 
perhaps the most significant change sought by thompson would 
increase his authority over the sevenmember chicago school reform 
oversight authority a body created to ensure that the reform 
measures are put into place 
the original bill called for four authority members to be 
appointed by the mayor of chicago and three by the governor 
thompsons version would give the governor and the mayor three 
appointments each with the seventh member to be chosen jointly 
among thompsons other proposals for change 
allow the oversight authority to withhold funds if school 
officials dont implement reforms properly 
give principals more authority over remediation programs 
for teachers whose work is judged to be substandard 
require local school councils to return to the board of 
education any unspent funds at the end of a budget year rather 
than carrying the money over into the next budget year 
remove a requirement that teachers with seniority whose 
positions are eliminated get first preference for vacancies in 
other vacant teaching posts 
when lawmakers convene for their veto session in november they 
may accept thompsons changes by a majority vote or override him by 
a threefifths vote and enact the bill as originally drafted if 
they fail to do either the bill is dead

prosecution witnesses testified today that 
alabamas naacp president said it would cost about 10000 for his 
efforts in helping secure early release of a convicted killer 
a federal court jury of 10 whites and six blacks including 
alternate jurors began hearing testimony today in the extortion 
trial of thomas reed a democratic state representative and head of 
the alabama branch of the national association for the advancement 
of colored people 
woodson chesser of columbus ga the inmates father testified 
that he took out two loans totaling 4600 and combined it with 
cash to pay reed 10000 he said he did so after meeting with reed 
about the imprisoned anthony chesser who is serving a 40year 
sentence for murder in alabama 
i explained my sons situation and asked if he could help me 
he said hed helped a lot of them and well see woodson chesser 
said 
robert muncy a partner in the columbus business where woodson 
chesser worked testified that reed told him he believed he would 
be able to help the inmate 
he mentioned that in order to get some help it would probably 
cost some money the figure i remember is 10000 said muncy 
reed the senior black member of the alabama house is charged 
with accepting 10000 in cash and between 5000 and 10000 in 
restaurant equipment from the chesser family reed operates two 
restaurants in macon county 
us district judge joel dubina ruled monday he would allow into 
evidence a tape of a conversation between reed and bobby gene 
chesser a columbus ga restaurant equipment salesman 
in opening arguments monday defense attorney bill baxley 
described bobby gene chesser anthony chessers uncle as a crook 
to beat all crooks and a con man to beat all con men 
bobby gene chesser who was convicted in 1980 to a 10year 
sentence on a felony theft charge testified monday he recorded the 
conversation with reed on aug 28 1986 when reed came to his 
business fbi special agent bruce koenig of bloomington va 
testified that the 27minute tape was authentic 
the tape was not played in court monday 
chesser wanted back the money allegedly given reed after the 
state board of pardons and paroles revoked an order to move up his 
nephews consideration for parole prosecutors have said 
assistant us attorney broward segrest told the jury that the 
fivecount indictment of reed described the payments chesser made 
to reed for his political influence in obtaining the early 
prison release of anthony chesser 
reeds attorneys challenged allowing the tape recording into 
evidence because they said it first went to a state parole board 
member before it reached the fbi bobby gene chesser told the judge 
he gave the tape directly to the fbi 
the trial is expected to last three days 
if the truth prevails ill be a free man when i leave here 
reed 60 told reporters when he arrived at the us district court 
in mobile on monday 
the trial was moved to mobile from montgomery because of 
publicity surrounding reeds indictment he also is scheduled to go 
to trial nov 7 in montgomery on related state bribery charges

the 1990 census with a price tag some 
estimate as high as 3 billion may have problems hiring enough 
workers to do the massive national head count census director john 
g keane said tuesday 
keane told the house census and population subcommittee that he 
generally is optimistic about plans for the 1990 count but he 
expressed concern over hiring 300000 parttime workers as well as 
over the general attitude of the populace toward surveys and 
censuses 
on nights when he cant sleep keane said i wonder if census 
can get enough good people to work well enough and long enough in 
1990 
the problems will vary from area to area and regions with a 
strong economy and many twoworker families will have few people 
available to take temporary or parttime jobs at pay ranging from 
550 an hour he explained 
one of the bureaus major management challenges is 
acquiring and retaining a sufficient number of competent temporary 
employees agreed gene l dodaro of the congressional general 
accounting office also appearing before the subcommittee of the 
house post office and civil service committee 
in 1980 there were times when the bureau could fill only 70 
percent of its openings in many areas dodaro said particularly in 
large cities such as new york dallas philadelphia and denver 
thus far dodaro noted the census bureau has been on schedule 
and under budget in its planning and dress rehearsals for the 1990 
count despite occasional technical problems 
dodaro warned though that with inflation the overall cost of 
the 1990 count could top 3 billion 
the census bureau has estimated the census will cost about 26 
billion well over twice the 11 billion it cost to count the 
nation in 1980 
but dodaro said he expects the final costs to outrun the 
planning estimates 
in addition to hiring keane expressed concern about americans 
attitude toward being counted 
the climate has deteriorated in this nation for taking 
censuses and surveys how much it has deteriorated we dont 
know keane said he cited as problems junk mail junk phone 
calls and sometimes questionable doortodoor businesses 
for most of the nation the census will come in the mail 
although census takers will visit many homes in rural areas where 
good mailing lists are not available 
congress is considering legislation requiring the bureau to 
adjust its final figures to compensate for people who may be missed 
in the national head count 
the bureau has resisted this in the past contending that it 
could not produce accurate estimates of people who are missed and 
warning that changing the count would damage public confidence in 
the numbers 
rep mervyn m dymally dcalif asked how the bureau would 
respond if the bill passes 
if ordered to do something we would do the best we could under 
the circumstances it might not be as good as some would like 
said peter bounpane who is directing planning for the 1990 count 
asked about a bill to require the bureau to count military 
personnel overseas for purposes of congressional reapportionment 
bounpane said that poses some problems 
counting those people and asking their home state can be done 
he explained but it isnt always easy to assign military people to 
a hometown within a state thus a state population total could add 
up to more than the sum of all the local populations in the state 
and that can cause difficulty in drawing congressional district 
lines within a state bounpane said 
counting illegal aliens in the census has also become a 
political question but keane explained that the bureau must count 
them the constitution and the 1790 census law require the agency 
to count everyone residing in the united states he explained not 
just citizens

a couple who claim their newborn was swapped 
for a baby with a heart defect are looking in the wrong place with 
a lawsuit claiming a florida girl is theirs a lawyer said 
ernest and regina twigg claim in a 100 million federal lawsuit 
filed here that their healthy newborn was swapped at hardee 
memorial hospital 
florida birth records show only one other white girl was born at 
the hospital about the time mrs twigg gave birth in 1978 based on 
public records the twiggs believe the florida girl who has not 
been publicly identified could be their child 
the girl the twiggs now of langhorne pa took from the 
hospital was named arlena and she died aug 23 of complications 
after heart surgery at the deborah heart and lung center in browns 
mills nj the suit says that while arlena was being prepared for 
a blood transfusion last may a doctor at johns hopkins in 
baltimore determined that neither of the twiggs could be her parent 
but dale swope a lawyer for the florida childs father said he 
believes the twiggs are wrong 
the girls father sees her mothers look in her face swope 
said the girls mother died of cancer in 1981 
swope said monday he will probably advise his client to provide 
a sample of the girls blood for genetic testing as a courtesy 
to the twiggs 
the blood test a procedure called hla testing that compares 
proteins on white blood cells is frequently used in paternity 
disputes and can prove that adults are not the biological parents 
of a child it also can offer an extremely high probability that 
adults are the biological parents of a child 
marvin ellin who represents the twiggs has said that if the 
florida girls father refuses requests for testing he will seek a 
court order the twiggs say they arent sure if theyll seek 
custody if the girl proves to be their daughter

a us military team flew to laos on 
tuesday to search plane crash sites from the indochina war for 
clues about missing american soldiers an official said 
in vietnam another us team was working with local officials 
on the second day of an unprecedented investigation to determine 
the fates of seven american airmen lost in plane crashes near the 
capital of hanoi 
maj thomas j boyd spokesman for the us pacific command 
said the team that left bangkok for eastern laos will examine an 
area around sepone to prepare for possible later excavations of the 
crash sites 
the team is from the us joint casualty resolution center and 
army central identification laboratory honolulubased units 
seeking to account for 2393 americans missing in action from the 
war in vietnam laos and cambodia that ended in 1975 with communist 
victories in all three countries 
they will look at crash sites and determine what kind of 
aircraft how it crashed and determine the potential for possible 
future site excavations boyd told reporters he said a marine 
with special expertise in plane crashes was on the team 
losses in that area near the vietnamese border include airmen 
downed in missions to cut off the ho chi minh trail used by 
communist north vietnam to infiltrate troops to usbacked south 
vietnam 
the united states and laos have conducted three previous joint 
crash site excavations most recently in may 
the american team in vietnam which brought its own 
interpreters are interviewing villagers who witnessed the 
incidents in which the men were lost and are seeking evidence such 
as local government reports and human remains 
boyd said the seven are among 70 cases in which the united 
states says there is strong evidence the men survived and were 
taken under vietnamese control the united states says it cannot 
prove any americans are alive in indochina but cannot ignore that 
possibility 
the defense intelligence agency is investigating 119 reports of 
purported sightings of americans boyd said 
the americans drove to the vietnamese villages monday in jeeps 
flown in from honolulu the day before the search is planned for 
about 10 days 
boyd said the two sides may later excavate plane crash sites 
found during the investigation 
previously the only significant joint field activity was in 
late 1985 when us soldiers and vietnamese state workers dug up 
the wreckage of a us b52 bomber just outside hanoi they found 
remains but none identified as missing americans 
lt col joe harvey leader of the us team in vietnam earlier 
expressed hope of several joint investigation operations in the 
coming months we are prepared to provide four teams if vietnam 
agrees he said 
of the missing 1757 are in vietnam 547 in laos 83 in 
cambodia and six in china us forces withdrew from indochina in 
1973 after the conflict cost 58000 american lives

treaties with six countries calling for 
cooperation in narcotics prosecutions and other criminal matters 
were approved by the senate foreign relations committee on tuesday 
after sen jesse helms tried and failed to shelve agreements with 
mexico and the bahamas 
the committee voted 172 to recommend the full senate approve 
the legal cooperation treaties with those two nations 
helms rnc protested that they should not be ratified until 
the president can certify that no mexican or bahamian officials are 
involved with narcotics trafficking 
cooperation treaties with canada belgium thailand and the 
cayman islands were approved on a voice vote and sent to the senate 
floor for action 
helms contended that the governments of the bahamas and mexico 
include senior officials who have assisted the drug trade he said 
ratification of the treaties would send a signal that the united 
states is not serious in waging war against narcotics 
you dont fight drugs by being partners with the drug 
traffickers he said 
but sen john kerry dmass said the treaties negotiated by 
the justice department will provide both a potentially important 
law enforcement tool and a gauge by which to judge whether the 
bahamas and mexico are living up to their commitments 
if we have this treaty in place we will have a justice 
department to justice department relationship that will be almost 
strictly law enforcement oriented kerry said there will be an 
opportunity for creative requests that will let us see if there is 
cooperation 
the mutual legal assistance treaties are designed to provide a 
framework by which the united states can request the cooperation of 
the countries involved to obtain evidence to use in criminal 
prosecutions in the united states 
each of the six countries could make similar requests of the 
united states

the environmental protection agency has 
ordered drastic curtailments of highly toxic tinbased marine 
paints banning unsupervised use by pleasure boat owners the 
agency said tuesday 
the regulations carry out a new law requiring a fivefold 
reduction in the release rate of the active ingredient in the 
paints tributyl tin or tbt compounds from most hulls 
the law bans use of the paints on nonaluminum hulls of vessels 
of less than 25 meters or 82 feet in deck length and requires a 
longterm daily average release rate of 4 micrograms per square 
centimeter about 01 thousandths of an ounce per square foot or 
less on other hulls existing paints can release tbt at about 20 
micrograms per square centimeter 
the paints may be sold from inventories until dec 16 and be 
used until next june 16 
sold since the 1960s the nine tbt compounds make the paint last 
much longer than other compounds needed to prevent the growth of 
barnacles and other organisms on hulls 
but their extreme toxicity has led to oyster shell deformities 
in france england and oregon and epa estimates that mussels and 
clams may be killed at concentrations as low as 20 parts per 
trillion a concentration reported for at least 30 us sites 
primarily areas with heavy boating activity 
as it proposed to do before congress stepped in epa said it is 
restricting sale of the paints to applicators certified under state 
pesticide programs use will be limited to those applicators or 
people working under the direct personal supervision of certified 
applicators 
formulators must revise labels to incorporate provisions of the 
new regulations and instructions for proper disposal 
the law gives epa authority to modify the release rate after it 
completes its studies and the agency warned that its action in 
adopting the congressionally mandated rate in its regulations was 
not final and could be changed 
epa said it may have enough data next year to determine 
acceptable limits to human health of tbt ingested in drinking water 
and fish tissues 
data on additional ecological effects worker exposure and 
environmental fate of the compounds are due from manufacturers over 
the next four years 
about 1 million pounds of tbt compounds have been used in some 
624000 gallons of paint sold each year of which about 4 percent 
has gone to paint docks buoys and other gear 
copperbased paints which require painting every year or two 
instead of the sevenyear interval possible with tbt are the chief 
alternative

press coverage and cameras said his lawyer bruce houdek 
williams 73 suffers from acute emphysema and an enlarged 
heart houdek said he is disabled from any work and needs an 
artificial supply of oxygen 24 hours a day

recognition of testimony against organized crime figures that was 
at great risk to his personal safety 
houdek said williams traveled from springfield to his farm home 
in leeton in westcentral missouri 
hes basically trying to be at home and relax and wake up 
without bars on the windows and people telling him what to do 
houdek said basically hes trying to acclimate himself to 
normal life 
this release is contigent upon his continued cooperation with 
law enforcement authorities parole commission chairman benjamin 
baer said in a statement friday baer added that williams could be

central states pension fund 
the parole commissions announcement friday came the day a 
federal judge had threatened to release williams if his parole was 
not reevaluated 
us district judge william collinson had ruled that the parole 
commission was unconstitutionally trying to block williams release

president reagan today signed a 105 billion 
appropriation bill for the interior department and related 
agencies but warned that it represents congressional 
overspending and runs the risk of acrosstheboard budget cuts 
under the deficitreduction act 
the measure appropriates 680 million more than the president 
requested he said it bings the nation 198 million closer to 
triggering cuts under the grammrudman law 
the measure was the fifth appropriation bill that reagan has 
received and signed of the 13 bills congress annually considers 
i urge the congress to act swiftly to send me the remainder of 
the fiscal year 1989 appropriations bills on time and on 
budget reagan said 
although he said that on balance the act merited my 
approval the president complained that it once again extended 
the moratorium on granting oil and gas leases for certain areas of

a national survey found major gains in 
stature for democrat michael dukakis in the presidential debate 
although that poll and three others rated the confrontation a tie 
overall 
none of the surveys found much change in voter preferences as a 
result of sundays debate between dukakis and republican george 
bush and most found relatively narrow movement in underlying 
opinions of the candidates 
but dukakis did better than expected at standing up under 
pressure and at appearing more presidential a los angeles 
times poll found and bush lost ground in his rating on being able 
to handle the federal deficit 
bush however improved his ratings in the poll on holding down 
taxes controlling crime and maintaining the national defense and 
more viewers rated him as likable than had expected to before the 
debate 
the outcome was rated even overall thirtyfive percent of the 
637 voters polled by the newspaper said dukakis won the debate 34 
percent picked bush and 29 percent called it a tie 
similarly in a gallup poll for newsweek 42 percent said dukakis 
did the better job and 41 percent said bush did better in a abc 
news poll 44 percent said dukakis won 36 percent bush and in a 
cbs news poll 42 percent said bush won 39 percent dukakis 
all the splits were within sampling error the polls were 
conducted sunday night by calling back voters who had been 
interviewed before the debate and said they intended to watch it 
its a wash said larry hugick political pollster for the 
gallup organization what we found is that the debate simply 
reinforced the image that voters had of these men prior to the 
debate 
as in predebate polls bush was rated higher on national 
defense 6331 in the gallup poll of 337 voters while dukakis 
scored better on compassion 5133 the two were rated even on 
being able to create needed changes and on having the ideas to 
foster good economic conditions 
said hugick these guys are just even on a lot of things that 
seem to be critical to whos going to win 
abcs poll of 639 debate watchers indicated a possible 
sliver of movement toward dukakis said poll analyst john 
brennan when polled before the debate the 639 favored dukakis in 
the election by 4846 when called back after the debate they 
favored dukakis by 5245 
but the cbs poll of 415 debate viewers found the possibility of 
incremental movement the other way that group favored bush by 
4944 before the debate and by 5243 after it 
in any case over 90 percent of each mans supporters stayed 
with him through the debate said brennan and that is the way 
these things go even if its a knockout the effect on the horse 
race is usually marginal 
on the movement in dukakis stature the los angeles times poll 
found that before the debate respondents were split on who would 
stand up better under pressure with 36 percent picking bush to 35 
percent for dukakis after the debate 48 percent said dukakis has 
stood up better to 24 percent for bush 
and voters by 49 percent to 22 percent had expected bush to be 
more presidential after the debate the division was narrower 
fortyfive percent said bush had been more presidential 29 percent 
said dukakis 
the los angeles times analysis called those results major 
gains in stature for dukakis 
also before the debate the newspaper poll found that 36 percent 
thought bush could do better at handling the deficit after the 
debate that fell to 23 percent overall though the race was a 
tie fortysix percent favored bush for president 46 percent 
dukakis 
the horse race results applied just to debate watchers and not 
to the entire electorate also the polls had relatively small 
sample sizes and onenight surveys can be difficult to analyze 
because they measure visceral reaction to a single event the 
margin of sampling error was five points in the los angeles times 
cbs and abc polls six in gallups

emperor hirohito thanked the japanese people on 
tuesday for their outpouring of concern over his fragile health 
but doctors expressed no optimism about his condition 
palace officials said physicians have failed to contain emperor 
hirohitos internal bleeding and the government said it has 
summoned the ailing 87yearold monarchs grandson home from 
britain 
kenji maeda head of general affairs for the imperial palace 
quoted chief palace physician akira takagi as saying the 
emperors condition is stable but its not improving either its 
an extremely difficult situation 
maeda said doctors found slight traces of blood in the 
emperors bowel discharge monday night an indication of internal 
hemorrhaging 
chief cabinet secretary keizo obuchi told reporters that prince 
aya the 22yearold younger son of crown prince akihito would 
return to japan shortly from his studies at oxford university 
japanese officials have refused to confirm or deny media reports 
that the worlds longestreigning monarch is dying of cancer 
cabinet members have remained within calling distance and 
scheduled visits by the prime ministers of italy and ireland have 
been put on hold 
more than 30000 wellwishers called on the imperial palace in a 
chilling rain tuesday to sign registries wishing for the emperors 
recovery the palace reported nearly 600000 people had signed 
their names to registries at the palace and at 11 locations around 
the country 
elderly japanese some wiping away tears knelt in front of the 
285acre imperial residence in central tokyo to pray for the 
monarch who was considered a deity until the end of world war ii 
informed of the public response to his illness the emperor 
commented today i thank everyone for their concern please 
express my gratitude according to a palace official 
all we can say is that the emperor has come through one week 
in stable condition the agency quoted akira takagi hirohitos 
chief physician as saying 
hirohito received another blood transfusion tuesday 
his slight fever of 982 was down from 99 monday evening but 
still above his normal level of about 959 
although the emperors body temperature and other vital readings 
appeared to have stabilized doctors said they were using 
antibiotics to control fever and inflammation news reports said 
the emperor was also suffering from jaundice and anemia 
hirohito has had no food in eight days and aside from two small 
ice cubes has been unable to swallow water and is being fed 
intravenously

the scientific adviser to the archbishop of turin 
said today he was told laboratory tests show the shroud of turin 
was made in the 14th century and could not be the burial cloth of 
christ 
professor luigi gonella said he has not yet seen the official 
report from the three laboratories that conducted the carbon14 
dating tests but that all the leaks to the press dated it to the 
14th century and somebody let me understand that the rumors were 
right 
all the leaks were too exact too concentrated to be a pure 
invention he said in a telephone interview from the archdiocese 
in turin 
the shroud 14 feet 3 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches wide 
bears the faint bloodstained image of a whipped and crucified 
man some have maintained the linen is the burial cloth of christ 
while others have dismissed it as a clever forgery 
gonella refused to identify who had told him about the shroud 
but expressed anger the person did not apologize for the leaks to 
the press 
it is quite evident somebody sold out to the press said 
gonella 
gonella said it was not the church that demanded secrecy and 
denied they were holding back the results 
they the labs asked for the blind test they said they would 
make no effort to determine which sample came from the shroud the 
raw data was to be sent back to the british museum where the key to 
the code would identify the samples from the shroud then they 
would write up the scientific result he said 
it is now clear somebody i dont know who or how many made a 
deliberate effort to determine which sample was the shroud and 
released it to the press said gonella 
gonella said the british museum as coordinator of the study 
had access to the results it reportedly sent the official results 
friday to turin by special courier 
gonella said the official results will be released quickly 
after the owner pope john paul ii is informed however he said 
he could not say exactly when the tests would be made public 
the laboratories chosen to conduct the carbon14 tests were 
oxford the university of arizona and the swiss federal institute 
of technology at the university of zurich 
the roman catholic church does not claim the shroud as a holy 
relic but instead considered the shroud a cherished object and 
treated it with the respect due a holy relic because of the 
possibility it could be the burial cloth of christ gonella said 
gonella also bristled at suggestions in the press that if the 
shroud was dated to the 14th century it had to be a forgery or a 
fake 
it could be a genuine work of christian art gonella said 
just because it is not the burial cloth of christ does not 
necessarily mean it is a forgery or a fake which implies an intent 
to mislead he said 
gonella said tests results dating the shroud to the 14th century 
would not entirely resolve the centuriesold riddle about the 
shroud 
one of the lasting mysteries is how the shroud was made 
gonella pointed to the other scientific studies such as the 
1978 shroud of turin project which could not determine exactly how 
the image on the shroud was created during that study dozens of 
american scientists subjected the cloth to chemical and computer 
analysis and took 30000 photographs of it 
the short recorded history of the shroud has always fueled the 
debate on its authenticity french crusader robert of clari 
mentioned seeing the shroud in 1203 in constantinople at the 
imperial palace but the first actual records trace it only to 
lirey in france in 1354 
the shroud was bequeathed to the pope by exking umberto ii of 
italy a member of the house of savoy upon his death in 1983

pilot said another aircraft was in the process of landing on a 
perpendicular runway in front of quayles plane the airfield has 
no air traffic control operation

theyve never seen michael jackson but 
do a fair imitation of moonwalking for indian fans of western 
rock music the beatles are a cult elvis is still alive and 
madonna is scintillating 
almost no major western rockers have toured india but that 
hasnt prevented thousands of indians from being hooked on their 
music 
the long wait for a top western pop concert ends friday when a 
rockstarstudded entourage including bruce springsteen sting and 
tracy chapman hits new delhi as part of a worldwide amnesty 
international tour 
this is the biggest show to reach southeast asia said anil 
gupta an organizer of the concert its the first time musics 
megastars are playing in the region 
it will be staged in jawaharlal nehru stadium with 70000 
tickets on sale 
i visualize it as more than a sellout said gupta i have 
gotten inquiries for tickets from as far away as trivandrum 
trivandrum on the southern tip of india is 1115 miles from 
new delhi 
it is the first large western music concert in india since the 
groups boney m and osibisa performed in the early 1980s 
but cassettes of western artists sell by the hundreds every day 
in the shops of major indian cities 
letters pour into the western music section of the 
governmentowned radio station which runs at least three weekly 
request programs from new delhi and other big cities 
i hear music from every house when i return home at night 
says rocque fernandes a drummer and the leader of a band which 
plays in new delhi hotels and restaurants 
its mostly beat music played on loud stereos but theres 
almost no hindi music to be heard maybe because hindi music 
nowadays is western music for 11 bars at a time 
under international copyright laws any duplication of at least 
12 bars of existing music is an infringement 
hindi music is the term used to describe songs in films in the 
hindi language in earlier years the films were mostly lyrical 
romances and their soulful songs helped make a movie popular 
but more recent films are more actionoriented pulsing with a 
disco hindilanguage soundtrack whose rhythms are usually taken 
from western hit tunes 
fernandes from the indian state of goa a former portuguese 
colony leads a band which provides a rare opportunity to hear 
western music live in india 
in live indian performances the music imitates the original 
but the vocals often have the unmistakable accent of an indian 
speaking or singing in english 
fernandes concedes his trio which usually consists of a lead 
guitarist doubling as the vocalist a bass guitarist and himself on 
the drums cannot provide the best quality of music our 
equipment isnt that good he said 
its also difficult for most people to afford the prices our 
hotels and clubs charge he said ultimately most fans have to 
be satisfied with their stereos live music is expensive and even 
then its not too good 
the cassettes sell for about 215 and pirated versions go for 
about twothirds the price records are difficult to come by and 
compact discs have not yet made an impact in the country 
the recent top sellers according to new delhi shop owner ashok 
chehal are madonna samantha fox and michael jackson

attorneys for syndicated columnist carl t 
rowan today argued that errors on a police form make it impossible 
to prove rowan used an unregistered handgun to wound a teenager 
intruder 
sgt rise williams who works in the district of columbia police 
departments gun control unit testified that the form filled out 
several days after the june 14 incident to show that rowan had not 
registered the weapon used in the shooting did not specify 
whether the paper referred to the columnist or his son carl jr 
under questioning from raoul carroll rowans attorney williams 
also testified that rowans birthdate is listed on the form as 
sept 11 1925 rowans actual birthdate is aug 11 1925 
williams said the columnists address is listed correctly on the 
form but also testified that rowans son a former fbi agent had 
used his fathers address when he registered other weapons 
a photograph of the person named on the form is another method 
by which police can identify the individual named on the document 
but prosecutor thomas c collier did not ask williams to say 
whether the columnists or his sons photograph is attached to the 
document williams refused to tell reporters after her testimony 
which rowans picture was attached to the form 
arguing that the registration form the police departments 
formal method for telling prosecutors an unregistered weapon has 
been used in a crime fails to link rowan to an unregistered 
weapon carroll asked dc superior court judge arthur l burnett 
sr for an immediate judgement of innocence burnett denied that 
motion 
rowan an outspoken opponent of handgun use and possession on 
june 14 shot a teenager who took a dip in the columnists pool 
without permission if convicted on the charges of unlawful 
possession of a gun and ammunition rowan would face a maximum 
penalty of two years in jail and a 2000 fine 
burnett on monday selected a panel of 14 jurors including two 
alternates from a pool of 60 prospective jurors 
the jurors are eight men and six women eleven are black three 
are white rowan 63 is black 
during the proceedings rowan sat impassively at the defense 
table occasionally glancing at family members seated in the 
courtroom 
burnett said the trial could last as long as a week but carroll 
estimated that the matter could be sent to a jury by wednesday 
rowan has steadfastly maintained that his son was repeatedly 
rebuffed by city officials in his efforts to register the weapon 
used in the shooting 
carroll had argued that the charges against the columnist should 
be dismissed on these grounds but burnett rejected that motion 
ruling that the case centered on whether rowan was authorized to 
use the weapon not whether it had been properly registered 
however burnett ruled monday that rowan can enter as evidence 
his sons account of efforts to register the 22caliber weapon 
and detailed information about death threats the columnist says 
prompted him to accept the weapon from his son in early 1983

inventive measures to finance their first album church and 
state to be released in november 
first the band tried to woo investors in a widely publicized 
plea last year but backers were apparently more interested in 
precious metal than heavy metal and the five raised only 1500 of 
the 15000 they needed 
so we had a raffle at the bowling alley band leader leader 
rick lang an assistant manager of a north side bowling alley said

canadians were shamed angry and saddened tuesday 
that national hero ben johnson was stripped of his olympic gold 
medal for using drugs to enhance his performance 
i feel terribly sad for him said fergus kilmartin 36 of 
coquitlam british colombia i dont believe he did it on 
purpose he hasnt got the guile to do that 
a disappointed nation awaited the return of the sprinter after a 
urine sample was found to contain traces of anabolic steroids 
canadas sole gold medal went to american carl lewis who finished 
second in the 100meter dash 
it puts a dent in canada said scott shaw a 10th grade 
student in calgary alberta said tuesday 
prime minister brian mulroney who had thanked the jamaicanborn 
runner for the thrill of a lifetime after his recordbreaking 
979second performance saturday called the drug scandal a 
moment of great sorrow for all canadians 
sports minister jean charest who called the incident a 
national embarrassment said johnson will be banned from canadas 
national team for life charest said his government accepted the 
validity of the tests and the suspension would be effective pending 
an appeal from johnson 
but johnsons family was left confused and outraged by the turn 
of events 
my brother is not guilty a distaught rodney told reporters 
in her yard in the toronto suburb of rexdale if you could cut 
him into a million pieces and test him over again my brother is 
not on drugs 
outside the townhouse police were called in to control the 
crowd and the traffic throughout monday evening local children 
attempted to raise a chorus of ben ben ben only to give up 
when the crowd would not respond 
weve just seen the destruction of a role model said former 
downhill skier ken read of calgary now canadas representative on 
the international olympic committees athletics commission 
it was the second shock to national sports fans in recent 
months in august fans were outraged when hockey legend wayne 
gretzky another national hero was traded from the edmonton oilers 
to the los angeles kings 
some canadian athletes expressed sympathy for johnson 
mike sokowski a teammate at the 1984 olympic games in los 
angeles said bens a pretty simple guy ben does not do drugs 
he did not knowingly do this 
canadian speedskater gaetan boucher judged the sprinter harshly 
saying he has no respect for an athlete who takes drugs 
boucher won two gold medals at the 1984 winter games in sarajevo 
yugoslavia 
charest acknowledged that it was suggested to him several months 
ago that johnson might be using steroids 
from time to time people would come to me in a private way 
and this happened one or two times that maybe ben johnson is 
using steroids or other drugs he said 
he said the allegations came from no one officially connected 
with the olympic team and that he had heard similar unfounded 
allegations about other atheletes in the past 
johnson was last tested in canada in february at a montreal 
laboratory 
charest said he didnt press johnson to have a drug test because 
he thought the sprinter was aware that medal winners at the 
olympics would be tested for drugs immediately following 
competition 
everybody knew in advance that mr johnson if he wins a 
medal was going to be tested said charest

president reagan in a farewell meeting 
with west european and pacific figures said today that free 
nations must work harder to share the cost of defense 
in a meeting with officials of 18 european and pacific allies 
including south korea australia and japan the president raised 
anew the question of alliance burdensharing the persistent us 
plea that americas allies shoulder a larger share of the costs of 
defending western europe 
in reply allied leaders underscored the heavy contributions 
their governments were making to developing countries and said 
this should be considered a significant contribution to the joint 
objectives of the north atlantic treaty organization 
they spoke in the same general terms as the president 
recognizing that everyone must continue to do their share said 
assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway 
she said that reagan who leaves office in about four months 
told the allied leaders that prosperity and security are 
inextricably linked 
winding up two days of meetings with a wide array of world 
figures reagan also restated american condolences over the death 
of pakistani president mohammed zia ul haq 
but he told reporters that he did not know the circumstances 
behind zias death in an airplane crash 
all ive heard are speculations and so forth the president 
said during a picturetaking session i have not gotten an 
official report yet from any of our people 
on monday reagan told leaders of persian gulf states that the 
us decision to stop escorting individual ships represents just 
a slight difference in the navys waterway policing operation 
posing for pictures with sheik jaber alalmed alsabah the emir 
of kuwait reagan said were not lessening our protection there 
at all 
on a busy day in which the president made his swansong visit to 
the united nations reagan also heard an upbeat assessment of 
middle east peace prospects and voiced new hope that american 
hostages in lebanon might be set free 
but the meetings were dominated by talk of the administrations 
decision to abandon the policy of escorting usflagged ships 
traveling the dangerous persian gulf oil shipping lanes 
we didnt stop this is just a slight difference reagan 
said it was a navy decision made because of a change in the 
situation in the middle east 
us officials said the threat to commercial shipping in the 
area has waned since aug 20 when iran and iraq began observing a 
un ceasefire resolution 
assistant secretary of state richard murphy acknowledged during 
a news briefing that the kuwaiti leader had told reagan he was 
concerned that the united states keep open international shipping 
channels 
murphy said the move from individual ship escorts to a more 
general us military surveillance and protection operation 
represents no significant reduction in our force levels and no 
reduction in our commitment to help defend the freedom of 
navigation 
there has been no overnight decision to drastically reduce the 
forces within a set time frame murphy said the position 
remains the forces will go down as the threat goes down 
during a separate picturetaking session with foreign ministers 
esmat abdel meguid of egypt and shimon peres of israel reagan 
seemed to raise new hope for the release of american hostages 
although presidential aides insisted there were no new developments 
to warrant optimism 
were encouraged reagan said when asked about chances the 
nine americans might be released but im superstitious 
about calling a nohitter before the game is over 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters what he 
said was i dont want to talk about hostages because it might be 
bad luck 
meanwhile reagan got assurances from meguid that the palestine 
liberation organization was trying to find a way to acknowledge 
israels right to exist 
that would meet a primary us condition for dealing with yasser 
arafats organization which all arab governments recognize as the 
sole representative of palestinians 
reagan told meguid and peres that the us goal was to move 
beyond the 1979 egyptianisraeli peace treaty to an overall 
settlement that takes into account the legitimate rights of 
palestinian arabs 
according to israeli sources who declined to be further 
identified peres said his government would not deal with arafat 
and the plo so long as they are involved in terrorism and violence 
and speak of trying to force israel back to the partition lines set 
by the united nations in 1947

george bush proposed a taxfree savings account for 
middleincome americans today and also said he now thinks he did 
better in sunday nights debate than he thought at first michael 
dukakis campaigned in the midwest as his campaign pleased with his 
debate performance clipped excerpts for tv ads 
bush in remarks prepared for delivery in columbus ohio said 
his proposed account under which 1000 a year could be invested 
tax free would help americans become better able to afford a 
home pay for college or start a business and would also 
contribute to national economic strength 
under the plan the money would have to be invested for at least 
five years and only people with adjusted gross income of less than 
60000 would be eligible taxpayers with adjusted income between 
50000 and 60000 would get only a partial deduction 
bushs campaign estimated the program would cost the treasury 
70 million in 1989 with the amount increasing to 550 million by 
1993 
on the flight to columbus bush also upgraded his assessment of 
his performance in the debate sunday night saying i feel better 
today about the way the debate went than the night of the debate 
as i think i told you i felt it was about even and i now 
think maybe we did a little better than that in terms of what we 
needed to do but i cant prove it 
earlier today at the university of miami in oxford ohio bush 
said of dukakis in the debate we smoked him out and showed 
dukakis to be too liberal for american voters 
dukakis was campaigning today in illinois a crucial midwest 
battleground where 24 electoral college votes are at stake 
with their general election showdown six weeks away the two 
presidential candidates used postdebate campaign appearances on 
monday to clarify statements from their first facetoface 
encounter 
at a rally monday in jersey city nj dukakis sought to 
distance himself from the american civil liberties union charging 
that bush was wrong when he suggested that i agree with every 
position ever taken by the aclu 
the gop nominee however refused to let the issue rest 
my values are your values and they are not the values of the 
aclu bush told a rally and barbecue in hampton ga near 
atlanta 
aides to the vice president said bush would hammer away at the 
aclu issue in the next few days as he attempts to portray the 
democratic nominee as a liberal out of the american mainstream 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle was making his 
first foray into texas with stops in houston and el paso quayles 
counterpart democrat lloyd bentsen was traveling to detroit 
mich and kansas city mo 
on the day after the debate four nationwide surveys found 
little change in voter preference and underlying opinions of the 
two candidates the polls also showed that most americans believe 
dukakis vs bush ended in a tie 
a los angeles times survey however found that dukakis made 
major gains in stature by appearing more presidential and 
standing up under the pressure 
the dukakis campaign produced two campaign ads showing excerpts 
from the debate including the democratic nominees summation that 
the best america is not behind us the best america is yet to 
come 
bush meanwhile rated the debate showdown a draw 
i kind of thought it was even said the gop nominee hours 
after many of his senior aides termed his performance a success 
on monday dukakis and his staff tackled the issue of the 
massachusetts governors membership in the aclu a clear 
indication of the democrats liberal ways according to bush 
during sundays debate the vice president referred to dukakis 
as a cardcarrying member of the aclu and attacked some of the 
organizations positions 
dukakis said bushs efforts to link him to every aclu stand is 
nonsense and he knows it 
two months ago i signed one of the toughest child pornography 
laws in the united states of america dukakis said ive always 
supported tax exemptions for religious institutions and i 
certainly do not support oliver north who the aclu is defending 
bush and his aides tried to prevent the vice presidents debate 
comment that he hadnt sorted out possible criminal penalties 
against women who obtain abortions from becoming a fullfledged 
controversy 
campaign manager james a baker iii said bush gave the issue 
more thought overnight and decided women are additional victims 
and should not be punished for undergoing abortions 
but bush still believes in the possibility of punishment as 
far as the abortionist is concerned if the courts overturn 
current laws baker said 
bush told reporters at a rally in jackson tenn there was no 
change in his stance 
at the rally a joint appearance for bush and quayle the gop 
vice presidential nominee responded to dukakis debate comment that 
the notion of president quayle is a very very troubling notion 
tonight 
for many the notion of president dukakis is a very very 
troubling notion today quayle said

president reagan signed a 105 billion interior 
department appropriations bill tuesday but warned that it runs the 
risk of triggering acrosstheboard budget cuts by exceeding the 
spending level he proposed 
reagan also said the bill unfairly restricts offshore oil 
leasing but said that on balance the act merited my approval 
it was the fifth appropriations bill he has signed leaving six 
to come out of 13 that congress annually considers 
i urge the congress to act swiftly to send me the remainder of 
the fiscal year 1989 appropriations bill on time and on budget 
he said 
reagan who was in new york for the opening of the new united 
nations general assembly said the interior department measure 
exceeds his request by 680 million and brings the federal budget 
closer to sequestration under the grammrudman deficit reduction 
act 
this congressional overspending cannot continue if the nation 
is to avoid the uniform acrosstheboard cuts that a sequestration 
inflicts equally on lower priority programs and on the high 
priority programs upon which many americans depend he said 
regarding the congressional moratorium on granting oil and gas 
leases for certain areas of the outer continental shelf the 
president said the congress increased the damaging effects of 
the moratorium by extending it to apply to grants of permits for 
drilling and exploration activities under leases already granted 
for the congress to prohibit the issuance of such permits to 
those who already had obtained leases is unfair reagan said 
the president also said many provisions of the bill reflect a 
growing and disturbing trend on the part of the congress to include 
unconstitutional committee approval or veto requirements in 
appropriations bills 
he said the measure would require for instance the approval of 
congressional committees to change forest service regional 
boundaries to close forest service regional offices or to reduce 
personnel in the indian health service 
in granting authority or making appropriations by law the 
congress may not reserve to its committees approval or veto power 
over the exercise of that authority or the expenditure of those 
appropriations the president said 
since congress has indicated such a special interest in 
these matters he said the administration will consult the 
lawmakers about them

shortly before 9 am 
one of the neighbors told us that six months ago they told the 
architect that the building was loosening and and it was leaning 
he said 
asked if the severe rains brought by hurricane gilbert 11 days 
ago could have caused the collapse he said it had to have 
something to do with it

building nakashima said 
the building which had one apartment to a floor collapsed like 
a pancake into a pile about one story high and part of it slid

former democratic vice presidential nominee 
geraldine ferraro says both democrat michael dukakis and republican 
george bush did well in sunday nights debate but bushs success 
came probably because i taught him how to do it 
ms ferraro who debated bush during the 1984 campaign also 
said her unsuccessful campaign would continue to be significant 
until a woman is elected to the white house 
i have a place in history she said monday night before a 
speech at emory university and ill have that place in history 
until a woman runs and wins then ill fade into the woodwork 
ms ferraro a former new york congresswoman was the running 
mate chosen by democratic presidential nominee walter mondale 
making her the only woman ever nominated for president or vice 
president by a major political party 
the 1984 democratic ticket suffered one of the worst defeats

with the fighting fast and furious on 
the olympic fields the rice paddies of panmunjom seem eerily calm 
on this nomans land in limbo between south and north korea 
just an hours ride from seoul the battle being waged is one of 
symbols 
the only clear signs of the momentous sports gathering 30 miles 
away is an olympic flag taunting north korea and the signature of 
olympic swimming star matt biondi in the visitors book at camp 
bonifas the forward un command at the demilitarized zone 
more than halfway through the olympics fears of an attack by 
north korea against the games have receded 
in fact the communist north which had sought to cohost the 
games with its archrival appears to be studiously ignoring the 
international sports meet 
they havent even attacked the games in their propaganda 
said us air force capt david griffard who serves with the un 
command 
griffard is one of 375 people stationed at camp bonifas 
adjacent to the site of quonset huts where regular meetings are 
held with the north to discuss violations of the 1953 armistice 
agreement that ended the threeyear korean war 
since the olympics began most of the commentary from the 
norths loudspeakers focuses on the disappointment of south korean 
students that the games were not being held jointly in seoul and 
pyongyang the capital of north korea he said 
radical south korean students seeking unification with the 
north staged violent protests against the olympics in the months 
leading up to the games but their demonstrations have declined 
since the competitions began last week 
the men of camp bonifas about half of whom are south koreans 
have also noticed that the north is cranking up its loudspeaker 
music a little more for the constant stream of tourists visiting 
the dmz 
the blasts of music a mixture of oriental and western tunes 
are sometimes accompanied by praise for ruler kim il sung and 
exhortations to south koreans to defect 
but the souths propaganda machine is just as persistent as the 
norths 
the south koreans are encouraging visitors and reporters to take 
the opportunity to tour panmunjom making this the hottest 
attraction after the games 
as many as 18 tour buses a day cross the narrow woodplanked 
freedom bridge spanning the minestrewn imjin river and leading to 
the dmz tours offered to reporters and photographers covering the 
olympics are booked days in advance 
the visit begins with a 25minute slide presentation 
accompanied by a profusion of facts and figures about the dmz 
rattled off by a us officer 
symbols abound the americans call the mostly uninhabited gijung 
dong propaganda village the pagodalike building which serves 
as headquarters for the us and south korean armistice officers is 
known as freedom house 
less than 100 yards away north korean soldiers snap photos of 
the visiting reporters and peer at them through binoculars dont 
make any gestures to them the media group is warned 
visitors must be dressed properly no jeans shorts or 
sneakers we dont want them to think were decadent says lt 
robert feliu accompanying the group 
the troops who patrol the zone must be over 6 feet tall and over 
180 pounds in weight the north koreans tend to be shorter the 
purpose is intimidation pure intimidation says feliu 
in the battle of northsouth oneupmanship as on the olympic 
fields every inch counts 
so when the north raised its flag pole to 330 feet the south 
followed suit although the north has since upped it to 528 feet 
and the south has yet to match it 
north koreas headquarters building in the joint security area 
where the armistice talks are held is about a yard higher and 
longer than the adjacent un headquarters says cpl dale 
adkinson another military explainer but its much narrower than 
ours adkinson adds with satisfaction 
the us and south korean troops at the dmz are ever at the 
ready nothing special for the olympics says adkinson 
so on an autumn day in panmunjom the men feel as bored as ever 
the only highlight of their day is the olympic competition being 
beamed to them from seoul one hour and a world away

house speaker jim wright predicts the two 
house committees that have been asked to investigate his disclosure 
of cia efforts to provoke the nicaraguan government will drop the 
complaints 
wright speaking to a small group of reporters on monday said 
he expects the intelligence and ethics committees to agree with his 
contention that legislators have the right to comment on executive 
branch covert activities 
theyll dismiss it wright said of the gop complaint to the 
committees surely it has no merit it has no merit at all 
wright dtexas also repeated his assertion that he did not 
reveal any classified information 
i cant conceive of any committee of the house taking the 
position that the speaker is inhibited from expressing his 
convictions on something that is in the public domain he said 
i have not only the right but the responsibility to express my 
views 
he added i would just like to be credited with at least 
telling the truth 
but wright again declined to say specifically where he got his 
information on the covert cia activity that he disclosed a week 
ago wrights disclosure of what he termed us attempts to provoke 
overreaction by the sandinista government prompted formal calls 
from republicans for an investigation 
asked whether he had been briefed on the cia operation in 
nicaragua by the no 2 official in the house majority leader 
thomas foley dwash wright said i dont have any recollection 
of his briefing me and referred further questions to foley 
foley today declined to say what he had told wright on the 
subject saying his conversations with the speaker were private a 
foley spokesman said yesterday that his boss hado member im not going 
to discuss my 
private conversations with members of congress 
the fact that a matter is classified secret doesnt mean 
its sacrosanct and immune from criticism wright said he cited 
as examples the mining of nicaraguan harbors by the cia in 1984 and 
the agencys efforts to overthrow salvador allende in chile in the 
1970s both of which eventually leaked out 
it is against house rules to disclose classified information 
conveyed to the intelligence committee suspected violations of the 
rule must be investigated by the ethics committee known formally 
as the committee on standards of official conduct 
the committee met for two hours on friday and adjourned without 
deciding how to proceed on the investigation request filed by 
house minority leader robert michel rill and rep dick cheney 
rwyo chairman of the house republican conference 
the panels chairman rep julian dixon dcalif said he was 
conferring with intelligence committee chairman rep louis stokes 
dohio about how to proceed 
the controversy began sept 20 when wright told reporters there 
had been clear testimony from the cia about agency efforts to 
stir up civil unrest in nicaragua in hopes of provoking a 
sandinista overreaction that would dash peace talks wright said 
then that the information had been provided by the spy agency under 
congressional questioning 
since the disclosure provoked an outcry from republicans and 
intelligence officials the democratic leadership has been 
scrambling to shift the focus to the question of whether the 
administration action was proper at a time when it was voicing 
public support for the peace talks

some may swoon but others demand can he 
type indiana sen dan quayle is making an impression on women 
but its not always the one republican strategists may have had in 
mind 
when quayle catapulted to prominence as the gop vice 
presidential nominee it was hard to ignore two facts other 
republicans were far more experienced and quayle blond and 
freshfaced possessed striking good looks 
i cant believe a guy that handsome wouldnt be attractive in 
some respect to women said sen john mccain rariz at the gop 
convention in august 
anyone that goodlooking must stand for really good things 
said a supposedly surveyed woman in a recent doonesbury comic 
strip i think most women want a really hot guy to be in charge 
of the country agreed her friend 
mccain wasnt kidding but the mock doonesbury poll should have 
been adjusted for sarcasm according to the strip 
experts disagree on whether quayle will help attract women to 
the gop ticket headed by vice president george bush hes been 
credited with narrowing the gender gap but hes also been compared 
to a ken doll barbie dolls friend and labeled a 
hindrance rather than a help for bush 
when actor tom selleck escorted nancy reagan to the podium at 
the convention i saw grown women faint and moan said gop 
consultant ann stone there are a lot of women where physical 
appearance still is important i dont think quayle has the 
charisma of selleck but that still has some impact 
ann lewis a democratic consultant and ms magazine columnist 
sniffed at the thought candidates that would pass a hollywood 
screen test do not do noticeably better than candidates that would 
flunk it looking at the house of representatives will bear this 
out she said 
on the other hand former actor ronald reagan has had some 
political success 
recent polls showed bush had erased a 20point gender gap and 
was winning as much support from women as michael dukakis the 
democratic nominee 
democrats say quayle had nothing to do with this development 
but gop consultant eddie mahe said quayle has been the only 
variable in the race since the conventions thus you could hardly 
make the case that hes not a factor 
at rallies across the country quayle has encountered a mixed 
reception some placards carry messages such as but can he 
type and women dont vote for men prettier than they are 
but many women eagerly press forward to hear and touch him 
lewis predicted quayle would attract women who would have voted 
for the gop ticket anyway 
he may cause some excitement at parties and gatherings but he 
doesnt cause voteswitching among undecided or independent women 
voters she said right now he is the biggest single danger to 
eorge bushs election he is a land mine that george bush planted 
in his own territory 
republicans claim quayle has more than sex appeal to offer women 
voters and hold up his marriage as exhibit a quayles wife 
marilyn is a lawyer taking off more than a decade to raise the 
couples three children 
a lot of women in that age group of his wife professional 
women staying home to raise the children can relate to that 
family said mahe they feel that he understands working wives 
women as professionals 
marilyn quayle is the epitome of the modern woman said 
stone that says a lot about him that he has a partner that 
strong 
lewis said if i were a partisan republican desperately 
looking for something good to think or say about dan quayle 
marilyn quayle would be the best example i could think of 
mrs quayle herself blamed the prettyface controversy on the 
news media and recently declared george bush wouldnt have 
selected someone who could not stand in his stead for president 
but democrats beg to differ 
he just goes to prove that the word airhead is not sexist 
said democratic media consultant bob squier its like dorian 
gray for vice president theres this pretty face out there 
campaigning but someplace up in an attic somewhere is a portrait 
of this guy which is painted by his record 
some women have reacted with outrage to the notion that they 
would vote for a candidate because hes cute and despite heated 
denials that quayle was chosen for that reason some democrats see 
the possibility of a backlash against him 
women will look at this thing as an appalling cynical sexist 
decision said squier in the end his negative rating will be 
higher among women than bushs 
what is offputting is that everything in his life has been so 
easy for him said lewis if quayle were less handsome she said 
at least it would have been one thing in life he had to 
overcome 
well maybe there is something quayle has had to overcome his 
good looks 
jim ciccone an issues strategist for quayle says the senator 
fights the pretty face thing almost like a woman does theres a 
predisposition to think he doesnt have a brain hes really very 
intelligent and thats going to come out in the course of the 
campaign

japan plans to kill about 300 whales this winter in 
a research project aimed at proving there are enough of the mammals 
to resume commercial hunting government officials said tuesday 
a similar plan last year was sharply criticized by international 
environmental groups which accused japan of conducting the 
experiment to circumvent an international ban on commerical whaling 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said japan 
recently submitted the whaling plan to the international whaling 
commission for review but decided not to publicize its contents 
until the evaluation was complete 
they said japan planned to catch very close to 300 minke 
whales in the antarctic this winter the species is estimated by 
the commission to number more than 430000 worldwide 
the japanese government says research whaling is necessary to 
assess whale stocks and such factors as age sex and health 
japanese officials say they hope the research will prove there are 
adequate numbers of some whale species such as the minke to allow 
a resumption of limited commercial whaling 
last year japan told the commission it would kill 875 minke and 
sperm whales for research purposes but strong opposition from 
international environmental groups and other commission members 
reduced the catch to 273 minke whales according to officials who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
the officials said this years research methods will be similar 
to those practiced last year when ships sailed along a fixed route 
and killed only one or two whales in each group sighted 
in 1982 the commission passed an international ban on 
commercial whaling to allow scientists to study whale populations 
without hunting pressure the ban went into effect in 1986 and is 
to be reevaluated in 1990 on the basis of the research results 
japan officially ended its commercial whaling in antarctica at 
the end of the 198687 season when it caught 1941 of the mammals 
the commissions charter allows member nations to conduct 
research whaling without approval from the 42member body 
environmentalists have charged that japan where whale meat has 
long been an important protein source is using the research 
provision to maintain its whaling industry japanese officials say 
other commission members have not been serious about conducting 
research during the moratorium and plan merely to renew the ban in 
1990 
in the antarctic only japan is conducting research one 
official said speaking anonymously the people who are 
criticizing japan are not presenting any data of their own

journalists are flocking here at 
record rates to cover the launch of the first us manned 
spaceflight since the challenger disaster shook certainty about the 
space programs safety 
at least 5000 journalists had asked for credentials by tuesday 
to cover the discovery mission scheduled for liftoff thursday 
morning 
everybody thought shuttle flights were routine challenger 
proved its a risky business said robert hotz former editor of 
aviation week amp space technology magazine and a member of the 
presidential commission that investigated the challenger explosion 
32 months ago 
all four national television networks will cover the launch live 
this time only cnn had live coverage when the challenger exploded 
73 seconds after liftoff claiming the seven astronauts lives 
jerry hannifin a time magazine correspondent who has covered 
every manned space mission recalled one colleagues decision 
several years ago to stop covering launches routinely to his 
embarrassment now he said the shuttle was just like a 747 taking 
off 
but were not sitting here on a body watch hannifin said 
the us return to manned spaceflight is the biggest story of 
this decade and its our mission to inform our readers 
its frightening because we dont know if everything will be 
ok said judith weiner reporter for francesoir newspaper but 
it is also exhilarating 
she was among the large foreign press contingent including 
representatives from china australia new zealand brazil 
iceland italy and more than a dozen other nations that have been 
accredited two soviet journalists asked for credentials then 
canceled 
public interest in the space program has continued to grow 
said dick young nasa spokesman at the busy press center 
theres a zoo out there he added 
young and other nasa officials were also dealing with news 
representatives upset about unprecedented plans to restrict the 
number of journalists covering the launch at the press center 
about four miles from the launchpad the restrictions follow air 
force recommendations that cited safety concerns 
discovery accreditation requests are the most ever received for 
a space mission young said in the past about 70 percent of those 
accredited have shown up 
the previous record for journalists was 2700 at the first 
shuttle launch and about the same number at the apollo 11 and 
apollo 17 moon missions there were 1467 for challenger 
this is a significant piece of american history said mark 
kramer a cbs news special events producer coordinating the 
networks 100person operation here this is not a packaged story 
like the national conventions where the outcome is known 
cbs coverage will include wednesday and thursday evening 
news broadcasts from the cape with anchor dan rather and live 
coverage of the launch 
abc with anchor peter jennings and nbc with tom brokaw also 
will carry live coverage of the launch and anchor their news shows 
from the space center cnn will have anchor bernard shaw leading 
its live coverage 
the networks were working out of new larger buildings 
constructed since the challenger launch 
young said the national aeronautics and space administration 
accredits virtually anyone who is a legitimate journalist college 
journalists are accredited although the space administration draws 
the line at high school reporters 
only 1800 of the journalists will be permitted at the press 
center and nasa has set up a second press area 75 miles from the 
launchpad for the remainder 
the restrictions resulted from an air force study spurred by the 
challenger accident and the subsequent explosion of a titan rocket 
launched from kennedy space center the study calls the press 
center hazardous because of the possibility of debris from an 
explosion falling near the launch site 
young said the 1800 figure would permit all news media under 
deadline pressure adequate coverage but some veteran space 
reporters were angered by the restriction rep bill nelson 
dfla who flew on a shuttle mission also protested 
we do not feel nasa is in the position to tell us how many 
people we need to cover a story on principle we will never buy 
that said edward h kolcum a senior editor for aviation week

some burmese fleeing to frontier areas 
claimed tuesday they saw troops execute antigovernment protesters 
and a newly formed opposition group accused the military government 
of torture 
western diplomats in rangoon say there are increasing reports of 
executions of lowerlevel antigovernment leaders but they have 
yet to be confirmed 
the opposition league for democracy league issued the torture 
charge in a statement tuesday which said 
it the league condemns and demands immediate ending of 
irresponsible and illegal acts of arrests torture and killings in 
rangoon and other towns 
the statement provided no other details 
the coalition also named retired army officer aung gyi as its 
chairman former defense minister tin oo as vice chairman and aung 
san suu kyi daughter of slain independence leader aung san as 
general secretary and spokeswoman 
aung gyi immediately called for an interim government to replace 
the military government of gen saw maung which took power in a 
sept 18 coup and cracked down on nationwide street demonstrations 
the government announced tuesday that 348 persons had been 
killed nationwide 219 others wounded and 1107 arrested since 
sept 18 but the government has not mentioned actual executions of 
detainees 
the government previously acknowledged more than 250 deaths but 
has not mentioned executions western diplomats believe troops 
killed up to 400 civilians in the first few days after the coup 
in ghay baw bo near the thailand border some burmese said the 
executions took place as people protesting 26 years of 
authoritarian rule fled to areas of burma controlled by karen 
guerrillas 
soe hlaing a 36yearold lawyer from pegu said he saw nine 
people executed by soldiers on a bridge in the town of tharrawdy 
during his flight 
each was shot with a gun one bullet to the heart soe 
hlaing said 
a student from the rangoon institute of technology said he 
witnessed the sysematic killing of 10 people in mudon south of 
the coastal city of moulmein he spoke on condition of anonymity 
most of the alleged killings occurred after saw maung sent 
troops into the streets of rangoon and other cities to put down 
massive antigovernment demonstrations 
the league for democracy formed saturday united burmas 
traditionally fragmented opposition to revitalize the 
antigovernment movement after the military crackdown 
a league official announced the leadership appointments nine of 
12 executive committee members also were named with the open seats 
reserved for ethnic minorities also fighting the central government 
aung gyi said the group believes that an interim government 
is the only way to solve the present crisis in the country 
saw maung has promised the first multiparty elections since 1960 
but has not set a timetable he has not responded to calls for an 
interim government 
the league also said tuesday it firmly supports the general 
strike being staged by the government servants and workers and 
urges the strikers to continue until the movement for democracy 
achieves its goal 
saw maung has ordered civil servants who left their jobs aug 8 
to protest political repression and economic decline to returned 
to work by monday 
although the government claims some workers are back on the job 
business remains crippled

hog producers and importers have voted 
overwhelmingly to continue mandatory assessments to promote pork 
and help boost the image of the swine industry the agriculture 
department said tuesday 
assistant secretary kenneth a gilles said 33534 or 77 percent 
of the 43532 valid ballots cast were in favor of the checkoff 
plan only a simple majority was needed for approval 
the department conducted the referendum sept 78 at county 
offices 
gilles said that since a majority supported the program the 
national pork board which administers the program will continue 
to collect the assessments of one quarter of 1 percent of the 
market value of all hogs and pigs sold in the united states and an 
equivalent amount on all imported porcine animals pork and pork 
products 
the usda issued its order setting up the program on sept 5 
1986 and assessments began on nov 1 1986 but the 1985 law 
authorizing the program specified a referendum on the checkoff 
within 24 months to 30 months 
voting by state as reported by usda is shown here with the 
vote for the checkoff program in the first column and the vote 
against it in the second

a comatose police academy cadet one of 16 
overcome last week by strenuous training underwent a liver 
transplant today but officials said an investigation showed no 
evidence that he or others had been abused at the academy 
at a news conference the officials said the training was 
routine for the first day at the academy including repeated heavy 
exercise 
dr george grady the chief state epidemiologist had said 
earlier that his preliminary examination last week found its 
very clear the exercise was stressful 
but he said today that further investigation found at this 
time that the cause of the illness was a relatively insufficient 
intake of water relative to the amount of exercise they were 
doing 
gary egan executive director of the massachusetts criminal 
justice training council said there was strenuous physical 
activities as there always was on that first day but we have 
found no one that was denied water upon request 
asked if his conclusion was that it was the fault of individual 
cadets that they took ill egan said some of them were unware of 
the fact that they were doing damage to themselves earlier some 
cadets had said they had been given only a small amount of water 
the day the cadets had taken ill 
timothy shepard 25 of pittsfield who has been in a weeklong 
coma entered surgery monday night for a liver transplant at 
pittsburghs presbyterian hospital 
rose eberts hospital nursing administrator would say only that 
shepards condition was critical this morning 
pittsfield mayor anne everest wojtkowski who is acting as a 
spokeswoman for the shepard family said said the surgery was 
completed at 530 am today and the family was told that shepard 
came through the operation very well 
shepard was the most seriously ailing cadet after last weeks 
series of illnesses swept the edward j connelly criminal justice 
training center in agawam just south of springfield 
several former cadets have suffered similar fatiguerelated 
medical problems at the academy over the past four years according 
to former cadets and an amherst physician 
dr constance lentz said she treated between three and eight 
police recruits from holyoke in 1984 after they were overcome on 
the first day of training at the academy 
among the 16 cadets who were hospitalized beginning sept 19 
the first day of classes ailments ranged from dark urine to 
exhaustion and dehydration 
although several stricken cadets refused to be interviewed 
monday without clearance from superiors one former trainee said 
the training routine was severe 
ive been through basic training in the army and it was twice 
as bad as that said mike purcell who quit the academy after one 
day the doctors told me that if i had gone back for a second 
day i could have suffered permanent kidney damage 
after shepard collapsed while running sept 19 instructors 
allowed the recruits to drink two small cups of water purcell 
said before that they had lined us up at the bubbler twice 
during the day and only let us take one cup of water each 
six recruits remained hospitalized monday 
several local officials including wojkowski and north adams 
mayor john barrett iii asked the state attorney generals office 
to review the training program 
wojkowski met monday with egan and state police capt thomas 
white of the agawam academy 
i was completely dissatisfied with their responses 
wojkowcki said i suspect that the incidents are not isolated 
shepard was in top shape and had worked out more than six months 
preparing for the academy said his brother thomas jr he really 
wanted to be a policeman the brother said 
jeff grossman a spokesman for the state office of public 
safety said shepards condition may have resulted in part from a 
selfinduced severe diet 
but thomas shepard said his brother spent the days before 
reporting to the academy with his family and ate normally

a pill that prevents heartworms in jimmy carters 
bird dogs also halts a parasite that blinds thousands of third 
world residents and the former president is helping to make sure 
that it reaches them 
the task force for child survival a public health foundation 
based at the carter presidential center is overseeing a worldwide 
system to get the drug mectizan to the 85 million people at risk 
for the tropical disease 
mectizan is the commercial name for invermectin used by 
veterinarians to treat heartworms in dogs and other parasites in 
cattle and swine 
carter discussed his organizations role in the program in a 
recent telephone interview from his home in plains 
ive got two bird dogs and one of my constant problems is that 
my dogs get heartworms carter said when a mosquito bites a 
dog a little microorganism goes through the body and winds up in 
the dogs heart and causes heartworms 
mectizan is very effective against heartworm not only with 
dogs but with other animals and it also proves to be effective 
against river blindness because river blindness is caused by the 
sting of a little fly that grows in very rapidly flowing streams 
said the former president 
river blindness formally known as onchnocerciasis is caused by 
a parasitic worm spread by the fly it has infected 275 million 
people in more than 30 countries mostly in africa and latin 
america 350000 have been blinded 
one dose of mectizan kills the adult worms millions of tiny 
offspring and prevents the adult from reproducing for a year it is 
the worms offspring called microfilaria that cause the symptoms 
of the disease including skin lesions severe itching and the 
blinding eye lesions 
the medicine halts the progress of the disease but does not 
reverse damage already caused by microfilaria a person bitten by 
the fly who takes mectizan once a year for the eightto12year 
life cycle of the adult worm will be free of the disease unless he 
is reinfected by another fly bite 
mectizan derived from acids produced by a bacterium found in 
japanese soil is manufactured by merck amp co the rahway nj 
pharmaceutical company began developing the drug for humans in 1980 
another heartworm medicine for dogs diethylcarbamazine has 
been found effective in fighting a parasitic disease called 
loiasis prevalent in western and central africa the disease is 
caused by the loa loa or african eyeworm and it is spread by 
biting flies that feed on human blood the disease can cause heart 
and kidney damage 
the world health organization has been fighting river blindness 
for years who and merck spent seven years on research trials 
before mectizan was approved for human use by french drug officials 
last year clearing the way for worldwide distribution 
carter said merck has volunteered to make the drug available 
worldwide and free of charge the company said last year that 
building a distribution network was its only remaining roadblock 
thats where carters organization comes in merck and who said 
they wanted an independent committee of experts to review the 
organizations set up to distribute the drug to monitor any adverse 
reactions and to keep records on the permanent distribution program 
the mectizan expert committee is chaired by dr william h 
foege executive director of the carter center and a former 
director of the us centers for disease control who was 
instrumental in organizing the worldwide smallpox eradication 
program 
next month the committee will begin reviewing the first 
applications for the program clearing the way for merck to start 
shipping the medicine to highrisk areas

the failure rate on the national nursing 
exam given in july went up across the country and in kentucky that 
exacerbated a nursing shortage in hospitals nursing homes and 
other healthcare facilities 
nursingschool graduates can work as registered nurses until 
their test results arrive but those who fail lost their positions 
and that has left the industry scrambling to find replacements 
its terrible timing said carolyn a williams dean of the 
university of kentucky school of nursing who worries that the bad 
results also will scare young people away from a nursing career 
nationally 164 percent of people who took the twoday exam for 
the first time in july failed said carolyn yocom director of 
research services for the national council of state boards of 
nursing which prepares the exam 
that is the highest failure rate since the council started the 
exam in 1982 last year just 9 percent of firsttime test takers 
failed and in previous years the failure rate ranged from 8 
percent to 12 percent yocom said 
the failure rate increased in all 50 states she said the 
failure rate in kentucky was about 20 percent up from 10 percent 
in july 1987 and 8 percent to 12 percent in previous years said 
patricia calico president of the kentucky board of nursing 
michael rush vice president for member services of the kentucky 
hospital association said a survey the association did in 1987 
found that one in 10 registerednurse positions in kentucky 
hospitals was unfilled 
were in a real bind said bill massie chief operating 
officer of the university of kentuckys albert b chandler medical 
center 
the uk medical center already had closed three 
intensivecareunit beds because it didnt have enough nurses 
massie said 
changes in the test partly help explain the higher failure rate 
this years test covered new subjects to reflect the changing 
skills and knowledge required of entrylevel nurses yocom said 
also the number of correct answers needed to pass was 
increased but by fewer than 10 out of the total of 300 questions 
asked she said the council wont reveal how many correct answers 
are needed to pass the test 
yocom said the council expected the failure rate to increase but 
not by as much as it did 
she said changes in the exam accounted for only half the 
increase she theorized that increasing opportunities for women in 
other professions night and weekend hours in many healthcare 
settings and noncompetitive salaries have prompted fewer 
topquality people to enter nursing 
the kentucky board of nursing has asked the national council to 
offer the exam three times a year instead of twice so nurses can 
get into the work force more quickly the next scheduled exam is in 
february and by the time those results come out nurses who failed 
in july but pass in february would not be able to start work until 
about april

the newly arrived us ambassador in beirut 
has begun meeting rival lebanese leaders urging restraint and 
support for a peaceful presidential election according to the 
countrys constitution the state department said tuesday 
our highest priority now is to urge restraint on all parties 
and to emphasize the contribution they can make to peaceful 
constitutional presidential elections department spokeswoman 
phyllis oakley said 
ambassador john mccarthy arrived from the united states over the 
weekend on tuesday he talked with michel aoun the christian 
general appointed by outgoing president amin gemayel to head a 
military government as well as acting prime minister salim hoss 
and parliament speaker hussein husseini both moslems she said 
aouns government has been rejected by the moslem majority

the context of maintaining contact with as many of the lebanese 
groups and leaders important to the political process as possible 
under existing security conditions 
with a successful election the lebanese can begin to restore 
the functioning of government and initiate the process of reform 
and reconciliation that lebanon needs she added 
although the size of the us embassy has been reduced because 
of insecure living conditions in beirut all essential embassy 
functions are continuing and mccarthy and his staff will 
continue to maintain as broad contact as possible mrs oakley 
said 
she had no comment on a beirut report that aoun had banned 
direct helicopter flights to the embassy

executive vice president of the titusville area chamber of commerce 
green bows were on virtually everyones dress or lapel in 
keeping with the space coasts green for shuttle go tourist 
slogan green is appropriate too because of the many greenbacks

my business had increased 10 times over the last few months 
said mada davis owner of a souvenir shop in cocoa beach 
police county and local officials anticipate one of the biggest 
launch crowds since the apollo moon missions and the first shuttle 
launch in 1981 some visitor estimates are upwards of 1 million 
while business owners and tourism executives beat the drums 
welcoming visitors others are bracing for a traffic nightmare and 
rushing to set up medical aid stations portable toilets and 
temporary food stands 
can you imagine about a million people wanting to go to the 
bathroom at about the same time joked ralph mcmullen director 
of the countys tourist development agency 
brevard county which prefers the tag space coast has only 
8300 hotelmotel rooms and some 4000 campsites and they were all 
reported full on tuesday 
among those not having to sweat and jostle for viewing spaces 
along the indian river banks at jetty point park or on the nasa 
causeway will be more than 2000 special nasa guests who will be 
ushered to a site on the space center grounds these include at 
least 50 members of congress a saudi arabian prince actor john 
travolta actress darryl hannah a couple of cabinet members and 
former astronauts

the experience to other people said space agency spokesman mitch 
varnes

of journalists many of whom came early and plan to stay late more 
than 5000 requests for credentials were received by nasa said 
space agency spokesman dick young and of that about 70 percent 
were expected to be here

its just like old times for some veteran bartenders said 
norman kolsch operator of rainbows bar and restaurant in cocoa 
beach which is doing a heavy business in a concoction named 
shuttle shooters 
the red white and blue combination of grenadine cocoa creme 
and a mintflavored blue liqueur is so popular that hes thinking 
of putting on extra help just to keep up with the demand 
its really a big challenge and damn hard work dealing with 
the big numbers said catrambone but well take it in stride 
just like we always do 
he expects some quartermillion visitors in the immediate area 
around titusville a town of about 43000 police chief charles 
ball expects 100000 of them to line the banks of the indian river 
which is directly across from the launchpad about 12 miles away

in all the hoopla many residents along the space coast were not 
forgetting the horror of the last launch 
at a special mass last week some 250 elementary schoolchildren 
prayed for a safe mission for discovery and its five astronauts 
several of the youngsters remembered seeing the challenger 
explosion through their school windows on jan 28 1986 
but most were optimistic reflecting the generally prevailing 
mood

of the new house said tuesday the mayos hope to move in friday or 
saturday 
however he said the appliances that were donated to the home 
were just junk and that efforts were being made to get nicer 
appliances and furnishings 
theyve got very little furniture other than almost junk he 
said 
wood said he was going to birmingham to seek appliances and 
furniture donations and that a church in leesburg va was 
expected to assist with furnishings but he had no specifics 
she has taken care of lots of people over the years including 
a lot of elderly people and when the kids she kept get too old 
for welfare she sends them on to college if they will go said 
wood who broke an arm in a fall while putting up sheet rock in the 
house 
howard graham who directed the project with wood called mrs 
mayo a unique person 
she gives those kids more than just a place to stay she 
really loves those kids and they love her he said 
when their house burned down i just felt like the lord put 
the burden on me to help my neighbor but i havent done it the 
lord has made this thing work 
mrs mayo has been a foster parent for the state for 38 years 
she said she and her husband still hear from most of her onetime 
wards 
they still write or call or drop us a card or come by every 
now and then she said they still call me momma and him daddy 
theyre our children

republican george bush upgraded his 
assessment of his debate with democrat michael dukakis saying 
tuesday maybe we did a little better than just a draw 
bush who had tried to play down his forensic skills as he went 
into the debate told reporters on air force two i feel better 
today about the way the debate went than i did the night of the 
debate 
as i think i told you i felt it was about even and i now 
think maybe we did a little better than that in terms of what we 
needed to do but i cant prove it 
asked why his assessment was so much more modest than that of 
other gop officials bush said well those are what we call the 
spin merchants 
when a reporter expressed surprise that he was willing to use 
that term bush replied ive learned to weve got different 
levels of hand wringing in our campaign 
the lowest levels were relieved that i didnt massively foul 
it up its what we call the relief factor 
and i tell you as that worry factor subsided and it was 
replaced by what we call the relief factor you can understand the 
rising up of exuberance 
and so there were some proclamations of a knockout clear 
win but some of it was the adrenalin rising in that level of 
handwringers 
asked why he would keep handwringers on his staff he replied 
because they need to keep me on the ball i need their advice i 
welcome their criticism and advice unlike others i know im not 
perfect this will come as a surprise to you

terms plus 35 years in prison 
aaron lindh 19 of madison was sentenced by dane county 
circuit court judge robert pekowsky a twoweek trial ended 
saturday when a jury ruled lindh was sane jan 15 when he shot at 
people at random in the citycounty building with a 22caliber 
rifle before he was shot by police 
there is no remorse reflected in this record no guilt no 
conscience pekowsky said

deaths of coroner clyde chamberlain and county corporation counsel

replied no when the judge asked if he had anything to say 
before sentencing

unidentified young woman sat in the front row hugging and 
periodically crying 
the courtroom also was filled with relatives and friends of 
townsend and chamberlain many in tears 
the ramifications of what happened on the 15th of january will 
be felt a long time pekowsky said it deserves the most severe 
sentence i can deal out 
the judge imposed mandatory life terms plus five years for the 
murders the additional five years was added because lindh used a 
firearm the judge also sentenced the defendant to 25 years on the 
attempted murder charge and 90 days for carrying a firearm into a 
public building 
the judge ordered that the sentences be served consecutively 
after the hearing lindhs attorney state public defender 
robert burke said he will appeal the conviction 
burke contended lindhs rights were violated when he was 
questioned twice in his hospital room hours after the shooting the 
judge ruled the statements admissable 
burke also contended he should have been allowed to 
crossexamine a key prosecution witness who said lindh was not 
mentally ill about a separate case in which the witness may face 
charges before the state medical examining board 
burke said he wanted to find out if the witness may have 
fashioned his testimony to benefit himself in the event charges are 
filed in the other case 
burke also questioned lindhs safety in prison

israeli warplanes attacked proiranian 
shiite moslem guerrilla bases in south lebanon on tuesday police 
reported in israels 15th air attack on lebanon this year 
police said they were unable to compile a casualty report from 
the 10minute raid by two jet fighters on bases of hezbollah or 
party of god in pine woods near the christian town of jezzine 
hezbollah gunners opened up with antiaircraft guns as the jets 
staged their divebombing sorties at 1130 am on targets about 30 
miles south of beirut there were no hits police said 
in jerusalem the israeli command said the target of the strike 
was a guerrilla base in a shiite area near the village of 
alluwayzah 10 miles north of the christian town of marjayoun 
marjayoun is the provincial capital of a border security 
zone israel carved out in south lebanon in 1985 to serve as a 
buffer against crossborder guerrilla forays 
smoke billowed from the stricken bases just outside the zone as 
hezbollah gunmen sealed off the woods west of jezzine preventing 
police patrols from taking stock of the losses said a police 
spokesman who cannot be named under standing rules 
hezbollah is made up of shiite zealots backed by the islamic 
republic of ayatollah ruhollah khomeini they have long been waging 
guerrilla attacks on israels selfproclaimed security zone 
jezzine is the northernmost position manned by the 
israelisponsored south lebanon army militia which patrols the 
sixto10mile zone 
the last previous israeli air raid was on friday when jets 
raided palestine liberation organization bases near the southern 
port city of sidon killing three guerrillas and wounding five 
that brought to 68 people killed and 108 wounded the overall 
toll from israels 14 air strikes since jan 3

nbcs seven nights of summer olympics coverage 
made the top seven primetime shows in the ac nielsen co 
television ratings last week despite that coverage is receiving 
lowerthananticipated ratings 
nbc had guaranteed advertisers an average 212 rating last 
weeks coverage ranged from 201 to 168 a 139 was recorded for 
the halfhour before the presidential debate on sunday the 
90minute preemption seriously affected the overall rating 
said nbc analyst jeff boehme otherwise the olympics ratings 
pretty much rose as the week went on and showed an increase over 
the disappointing first three nights 
if the olympics rating doesnt live up to the guarantee to 
advertisers nbc has to provide them with free commercial time on 
other programs to make up the difference 
nbc won the week nevertheless with its highest weekly rating 
in a year a 193 that was also the highest network weekly rating 
since a win for abc during the winter olympics abc was second with 
a 107 and cbs third with a 98 
the olympics were good news and bad news for nbc nightly 
news it probably would have been in first place for the first 
time since 1987 thanks to the olympics boost but it only tied with 
abc for second place because of preemptions on the west coast 
for live coverage of the olympics 
the cbs evening news won the week with 101 rating and 20 
share abc world news tonight tied nbc with a 98 abc had a 20 
share and nbc a 21 share a result of different time periods that 
gave nbc a bigger portion of a smaller audience 
each rating point equals 904000 households with televisions 
the share is a percentage of sets in use 
the week ending sept 25 was the first of the official new 
television season however abc and cbs are maintaining the season 
doesnt really begin until late october when all three networks 
have premiered most of their new fall shows abc and cbs are airing 
reruns and movies to counter nbcs two weeks of olympics 
programming 
nbcs thursday night coverage was the toprated show of the 
week followed by saturday friday sunday wednesday tuesday and 
monday cbs followed with its rerun tv movie a stranger waits 
and abc made the top 10 with tuesday night comedies head of the

with six weeks to go to election day aides to 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis are scaling back 
expectations across parts of the south and rocky mountain west but 
express continuing hopes for texas and a handful of border states 
the west coast states are still viewed as prime battlegrounds 
as well and practically the entire northeast and industrial 
midwest are up for grabs in the view of campaign officials 
but one aide speaking on condition of anonymity said the 
campaign would soon begin pulling back budget and pulling back 
staff from some states where chances of victory are dim and 
saving them for the more competitive regions 
dukakis and his aides have pledged frequently to run a 50state 
campaign this fall 
watch the schedule for clues about which states are regarded 
as more winnable said one adviser also speaking on condition he 
not be identified by name in his campaigning since the democratic 
national convention dukakis has appeared sparingly in the deep 
south with the exception of texas home state to running mate 
lloyd bentsen dukakis recent trip to arkansas and kentucky were 
indications of a continued commitment to several border states in 
what shapes up as a close election officials said 
publicly senior advisers say they will not concede any state to 
bush we are not going to fall into the republican trap of 
cutting off parts of the country said dukakis field director 
charlie baker who said that the democrats have assembled a 
50state field organization for the first time in several elections 
dukakis campaign chairman paul brountas addressing a meeting of 
southern governors tuesday at sea island ga said were being 
realistic but were also campaigning here and will continue to do 
so becuase we think we can be successful in the south 
officials hotly dispute that they have reduced efforts in 
florida with 21 electoral votes and say they have recently 
dispatched new aides to the state they say that talk of scaling 
back is a republicaninspired ploy to undermine their chances 
but in contrast to texas where the campaign is committed to 
running television advertisements specially created for the state 
no similar decision has been made for florida and in contrast to 
dukakis periodic visits to texas the democratic candidate has 
been to florida only once since the democratic convention in july 
and is not scheduled to return until oct 11 
dukakis and his advisers have repeatedly pledged their 
commitment to a 50state campaign and at a meeting of campaign 
officials in july senior adviser jack corrigan said he promised 
the directors of the 50 statewide oranizizations that dukakis would 
commit the necessary resources in each of them 
in states such as virginia mississippi south carolina alabama 
in the south and traditional republican strongholds in the west 
such as wyoming idaho and utah arizona nevada and alaska as 
well as kansas and nebraska campaign officials concede privately 
they have little chance for success 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayles home state 
of indiana is regarded as an extremely difficult state as is new 
hampshire according to officials 
in all the states involved carry roughly 100 electoral votes 
out of 270 needed for victory in the race for the white house the 
states have voted republican in most recent elections and bush 
campaign officials have said all year they would give the 
republicans a solid launching pad for their campaign 
we are not at a point yet in our views to completely write off 
any states and it is not our plan to do that said baker field 
director for dukakis but clearly as this thing tightens up in 
terms of lastminute media buy decisions and last minute scheduling 
decisions youve got to make some decisions on how you put together 
an electoral college majority 
another aide speaking on condition of anonymity said it is 
important to keep states competitive in order to keep the 
republicans spending time and resources you see where we are by 
looking at the schedule but that doesnt mean we dont keep targets 
of opportunity either the aide said

the senate on tuesday approved an amendment 
reducing the number of businesses that would have to offer 
jobprotected leave to workers with medical problems or parental 
responsibilities 
but the ultimate fate of the family and medical leave act 
remained in doubt as the senate debated the merits of mandating 
rather than encouraging employers to offer the benefit also 
hanging was an amendment to toughen penalties for offenses 
involving child pornography and obscenity 
the bill sponsored by sen christopher dodd dconn would 
require employers of 50 or more people to offer at least 10 weeks 
of unpaid jobprotected leave to seriously ill employees or those 
with newborn newly adopted or seriously ill children 
sen thad cochran rmiss said employers should be encouraged 
rather than required to respond sensitively to family needs and 
said he would propose a tax incentive amendment with that aim 
dodds initial bill would have exempted only companies of under 
20 and required that at least 13 weeks of medical leave be 
available 
under the revised version dodd said only 5 percent of us 
companies would have to comply with the leave requirement reducing 
the amount of medical leave from 13 to 10 weeks also reduced the 
cost he said from 190 million to 160 million 267 per 
employee per year 
all this legislation says is that for 10 weeks every two years 
if youre confronted with a crisis you dont lose your job dodd 
said i dont consider that to be an unreasonable idea i think 
its human decency i think its common sense 
conservatives called parental leave a worthy important benefit 
but said it shouldnt be imposed on employers 
cochran branded the requirement a very drastic departure from 
current practice and it is not really necessary in trying to deal 
with the needs of a diverse and changing workforce we should all 
be concerned about the impact it may have on other benefits that 
may be available 
this will continue to make america less competitive 
contended sen steve symms ridaho nothing is costless in this 
society theres no free lunch 
symms said there was no need for congress to take up time on the 
leave issue at the end of a session with other important bills 
awaiting action i dont believe the people of this country are 
in any kind of emergency situation he said 
we didnt get elected to go home dodd shot back i know 
these issues arent easy we werent elected to the us senate to 
make everybody happy if 51 of my colleagues dont like this idea 
well go home

laboratory tests show the shroud of turin was made 
in the 14th century and could not be the burial cloth of christ 
the scientific adviser to the archbishop of turin said he learned 
on tuesday 
professor luigi gonella said he has not yet seen the official 
report from the three laboratories that conducted the carbon14 
dating tests but that all the leaks to the press dated it to the 
14th century and somebody let me understand that the rumors were 
right 
it is quite evident somebody sold out to the press said 
gonella in an interview from his home in turin 
he refused to identify who had told him about the results of the 
tests at oxford university the university of arizona and the swiss 
federal institute of technology at the university of zurich 
the shroud 14 feet 3 inches long and 3 feet 7 inches wide 
bears the faint bloodstained image of a whipped and crucified 
man some have maintained the herringbone patterned linen is the 
burial cloth of christ while others have dismissed it as a clever 
forgery 
we are certainly disappointed in knowing that the shroud has a 
medieval date but this is because it is a cherished object its 
like having a portrait in your attic that turns out not to be a 
picture of your grandfather but you dont love him less gonella 
was quoted as saying to britains domestic news agency press 
association 
the shroud was removed april 21 from the silver chest where it 
is kept wrapped in red silk on an altar in the cathedral in turin 
a strip fourtenths of an inch by 28 inches was cut from 
the cloth and then divided into three smaller pieces for the 
laboratories each of which got one piece in addition to another 
piece of cloth of a known age 
gonella said the british museum which coordinated the study 
with the three laboratories reportedly sent the test results to 
turin by special courier on friday he said he believed turins 
archbishop cardinal anastasio ballestrero would see the study 
when he returned to his office wednesday after a threeday absence 
the scientist said it was not the church that demanded secrecy 
and denied holding back the results which he said will be made 
public quickly after pope john paul ii is informed however he 
said he could not give a date 
we are very angry we are being accused of trying to hide the 
results accused of taking part in a conspiracy to hide the truth 
of being afraid of the truth gonella said 
now everybody is sure we knew the results when we didnt know 
in any credible way he said adding that it was the three 
laboratories and not the church that had asked for secrecy 
they asked for the blind test they said they would make no 
effort to determine which sample came from the shroud the raw data 
was to be sent back to the british museum where the key to the code 
would identify the samples from the shroud then they would write 
up the scientific result he said 
the roman catholic church does not claim the shroud as a holy 
relic but has treated it with respect because of the possibility it 
could have been christs burial cloth gonella said 
he said the church always knew it could not prove that the 
shroud was the actual burial cloth of christ but he bristled at 
suggestions that a medieval date for the shroud means it is a fake 
it could be a genuine work of christian art he said just 
because it is not the burial cloth of christ does not necessarily 
mean it is a forgery or a fake which implies an intent to 
mislead 
he said the test results would not entirely resolve the 
centuriesold mystery surrounding the cloth including how it was 
made 
gonella pointed to the other scientific studies such as the 
1978 shroud of turin project which could not determine exactly how 
the image on the shroud was created 
french crusader robert of clari mentioned seeing the cloth in 
1203 in constantinople at the imperial palace but the first actual 
records trace it only to lirey in france in 1354 
the shroud was bequeathed to the pope by former king umberto ii 
of italy a member of the house of savoy upon his death in 1983

the university of mississippi has banned 
all oncampus fraternitysorority parties because a woman said she 
was raped after a similar event off campus officials said 
stover smith 18 of metairie la was charged friday with rape 
in the alleged attack after a party offcampus thursday night said 
oxford police chief billy white 
white said the woman left the party with someone shortly after 
midnight she said she was driven to a field three to five minutes 
away then beaten and raped 
smith who has since withdrawn from school was free on 50000 
bond white said 
judy trott assistant dean of students in charge of 
fraternities said the thursday night swaps which bring 
together an entire fraternity and an entire sorority would no 
longer be sanctioned by the university 
trott said the swaps began as a lowkey way for freshmen to meet 
but had evolved into fullscale parties often involving alcohol 
and loud music 
ive been concerned about this for years trott said this 
kind of incident capped it off 
thomas j reardon assistant dean of students in charge of 
fraternities said he would investigate the incident which 
followed a party involving sigma alpha epsilon fraternity and chi 
omega sorority 
interfraternity council president stuart brunson said sigma 
alpha epsilon was already on social probation because of a rush 
infraction and was prohibited from having oncampus parties 
trott said that although the party was off campus it still 
reflected on the fraternitysorority system 
she said the suspension would be indefinite unless the 
organizations come up with recommendations down the road that 
could convince me they could control the situation

lt gen james a abrahamson the first and 
only director of president reagans star wars research program 
has decided to retire from the military next february the pentagon 
said tuesday 
the 55yearold abrahamson a threestar air force general who 
assumed command of the fledgling strategic defense initiative 
organization in april 1984 will be replaced by air force lt gen 
george l monahan jr said dan howard the pentagons chief 
spokesman 
monahans nomination must be confirmed by the senate 
abrahamson will retire feb 1 after 33 years of active military 
service howard said the general has not announced any future 
plans 
according to documents released tuesday by the pentagon 
including a memo from abrahamson to defense secretary frank c 
carlucci the star wars chief decided on his own early this summer 
to request retirement 
abrahamson said he had concluded the next president should be 
allowed to dictate new policies for star wars development to a new 
leadership team 
i am proud of the people of sdi who have not indulged 
themselves with the negative it cant be done approach to 
problems abrahamson wrote 
however a new administration will undoubtedly have different 
ideas or approaches to sdi therefore i reluctantly have concluded 
that the program will best be served by allowing new leadership to 
represent new policy and direction as you requested i will serve 
until a successful transition is well under way 
the star wars program is an effort to develop lasers and other 
exotic weapons that could be deployed in space and on the ground to 
automatically shoot down soviet nuclear missiles congress 
repeatedly has refused in recent years to fund the program at the 
pace sought by president reagan but nonetheless has allowed the 
research to continue 
abrahamson a former astronaut who never got to fly in space is 
credited with putting together a formal organization to oversee the 
research work which is conducted in laboratories around the world 
while serving as an effective cheer leader to congress and 
the business community 
even in his retirement memo to carlucci abrahamson couldnt 
resist praising the program saying his star wars job had been the 
best of his career and had allowed me to appreciate the daring 
scope of the presidents vision and the genius available to the 
country to solve this and other daunting challenges 
i have great confidence that this initiative will go forward 
and will succeed i will continue to dedicate myself to sdi to my 
last day of active duty and after 
abrahamson a native of williston nd is a vietnam war combat 
pilot who trained as an astronaut for the manned orbiting 
laboratory program before it was canceled in 1969 
in 1981 the general returned to the world of space serving as 
the national aeronautics and space administrations associate 
administrator for the shuttle program he oversaw the first 10 
shuttle launches before returning to the air force and assuming 
command of the star wars effort

despite reforms the pentagon is still doing a 
poor job of managing its inventory of millions of stockpiled items 
ranging from aircraft spare parts to food and clothing a senate 
report said tuesday 
the pentagon should reduce the huge and growing volume of items 
it has in its inventory according to the study by the senate 
governmental affairs committee 
the report was the latest in a series of studies by the 
democraticcontrolled panel of how the pentagon manages its huge 
stockpile the studies have been critical of the defense department 
and have recommended management changes 
the studies affect socalled secondary items which include 
spares repair parts supplies food and clothing that stockpile 
is in contrast to principal items like tanks ships and 
airplanes 
there has been a large increase in the secondary item stockpile 
resulting from president reagans defense buildup the secondary 
stockpile which now contains about 46 million different types of 
items is worth 94 billion compared to its 43 billion value in 
1980 
the enormous unprecedented and unsustainable growth in the 
pentagons secondary inventory has simply overwhelmed the 
pentagons depots warehouses and accounting and control 
systems the report said 
the defense departments supply system has been unable to cope 
with the new demands made on it the management of current 
inventories has not kept pace with the pentagons ability to spend 
money on new goods it said 
for example two years ago the army missile command asked army 
officials in europe to return 24 stinger handheld missiles for 
test firing the missile command sought 24 specific missiles but 
service officials in europe were able to find only nine by march 
1987 
finally after searching the armys entire european inventory of 
missiles service officials were finally able to locate the other 
13 
army officials conceded that their policy for recording 
inventory information on small missiles was ambiguous and contained 
multiple and contradictory control requirements the study said 
pentagon officials asked for comment did not immediately 
respond 
however they agreed with the general accounting office last 
spring when the congressional watchdog agency raised similar 
criticisms of the pentagons inventory management defense 
department officials conceded they needed to do better 
the committee recommended a number of changes including a halt 
in the purchase of items not immediately needed and better 
administrative and internal pentagon controls over the vast and 
widely segmented inventories 
one example cited as wasteful spending was the purchase by the 
defense logistics agency of metal bars used to mount flashing red 
lights atop emergency and police vehicles used by the services 
because of an increase in demand the dla bought 4297 of the 
bars in february 1986 but shortly after the purchase the demand 
dropped that means that the dla now has enough of the bars to last 
for the next six years and stocks of the bars are now clogging the 
aisles of a sla warehouse 
the panel also said the pentagon needs to improve security at 
sites where weapons and other potentially dangerous items are 
stored a complaint raised in previous hearings 
for example the panel said its investigators found that 
stinger missiles were stored at various sites in west germany in 
lightweight metal sheds with the word stinger stenciled on the 
sheds side

a couple who sought a better life in the soviet 
union following financial setbacks in the united states are back 
home saying they are broke embittered and have been deceived by 
us officials 
theodore and cheryle branch who returned to the united states 
last week after 10 months in the soviet union were staying tuesday 
in a small motel in erie they had previously lived in nearby 
summit township 
by monday we will be broke so we are going to move into the 
us courthouse to live said branch 42 referring to the 
federal courthouse in erie 
the branches said they moved to the soviet union because we 
were so mad at the us government but not at the people 
were really mad now he said 
the couple claimed that after soviet officials gave them a 
furnished apartment and jobs at radio moscows north american 
service officials at the us embassy there offered them the same 
benefits plus help resolving their financial troubles if they 
returned to the united states 
however state department officials in washington dc said 
the branches were offered only the same loan available to any 
stranded us citizen to finance passage home 
they made promises there and now they are backing out 
branch claimed 
branch said that after they arrived in moscow the soviets asked 
them to visit the us embassy because american officials were 
worried about them 
he said they refused because we vowed we would never step 
inside another federal building they werent worried about us 
there why would they be worried about us here 
the soviets asked them in february to assure the us embassy 
that they were not being held against their will branch claims 
that during a subsequent meeting jill farrellybyrnes the 
embassys second secretary and vice consul said do you need 
money we have jobs for you we have a place for you to live and 
medical care 
at an august meeting the embassy officials said they could not 
help the branches solve their problems unless they returned to the 
united states branch said 
we thought if they were willing to work with us to make 
amends why should we hold a grudge he said 
no one greeted them in washington as promised branch said 
i think we have been deceived we have been stripped of 
everything said mrs branch 40 it is hard to believe that in 
a democratic society two people could be in such a predicament 
the couple want to be reimbursed for the 3000 airfare and the 
motel room 
the government is heavily indebted to us and why shouldnt we 
feel like this said mrs branch it is supposed to be a great 
democracy 
we wouldnt be here looking for a job if they hadnt promised 
us branch said 
he said they might return to the soviet union but are tired of 
moving back and forth across the ocean at somebodys whim 
the troubles that made the soviet union look good included the 
couples inability to collect 10000 in back wages from central 
florida broadcasting co despite a federal court judgment in their 
favor 
land they owned in erie county was declared part of a flood 
plain by the federal government and is worthless mrs branch said

a flight attendant testifying at 
the murder and air piracy trial of mohammed ali hamadi said tuesday 
that hamadis accomplice killed a us navy diver aboard a hijacked 
twa airliner 
the attendant hazel hesp said hijacker hassan ezzeddine killed 
diver robert stethem after the twa jet was commandeered june 14 
1985 
the testimony contradicted that of john testrake the planes 
pilot who told the court he believed hamadi was the hijacker who 
killed stethem 
ms hesp also testified that ezzeddine claimed a friend of his 
had carried out the bombing mission that killed 241 us servicemen 
in beirut in 1983 
hamadi a lebanese shiite moslem has admitted hijacking the twa 
jetliner on the athenstorome flight and holding 39 americans 
hostage for 17 days but said the other hijacker killed stethem of 
waldorf md 
ms hesp said ezzeddine who is at large seemed to be giving 
the orders during the hijacking 
the 47yearold ms hesp said said was the name ezzeddine 
used during the hijacking hamadi she said called himself 
castro 
ms hesp did not name her home or nationality under guidelines 
set by the court to protect witnesses in the trial some of whom 
have said they feared reprisals her speech had a british accent 
outside the courtroom at preungesheim prison security remained 
tight as it has been since the trial began july 5 there were about 
two dozen policemen near the entrance and at least three carried 
machine guns 
asked by the court judge if she knew who killed the 23yearold 
stethem ms hesp paused then said yes but i did not see the 
shot so it is only my opinion it would be my opinion that it 
would be said who shot 
she added they were both terrifying of course but of the 
two men it is my feeling that said was the more vicious 
i remember when we first took off from athens and they punched 
our heads down and they were running up and down screaming ms 
hesp said i remember i was always more afraid when i saw the 
white shoes because i knew they belonged to said 
other witnesses including flight engineer benjamin zimmermann 
have testified ezzeddine was the more violent of the two hijackers 
but that both seemed to have equal authority 
when asked to comment hamadi who sat quietly through much of 
the testimony with his elbow propped on the table and chin in his 
left palm told the court in arabic through his translator he had 
nothing to say 
throughout the trial the court has given hamadi the opportunity 
to comment without having to take the witness stand 
ms hesp said ezzeddine could speak a litte english and told her 
a friend of his drove a truck laden with explosives into the us 
marine compound in beirut in 1983 blowing up the barracks and 
killing 241 us servicemen 
he seemed to be very proud of this and told of how he hates 
americans and wondered how nonamericans could work for an 
american airline said ms hesp 
across the courtroom facing hamadi patricia and richard 
stethem the parents of the slain navy diver took notes and 
listened quietly 
in other testimony tuesday another flight attendant jody cox 
47 described how she and others on the flight were forced to sit 
for hours with their heads between their knees and hands on the 
back of their heads 
speaking in an unsteady voice ms cox an american said she 
heard the screams of hostages being beaten by the hijackers 
i saw clinton suggs with his hands bound and stethem too 
they had cloths tied around their heads as blindfolds ms cox 
said 
suggs testified monday he thought he would die next when one of 
the hijackers said after stethem was shot one more in five 
minutes 
hamadi was arrested at frankfurt airport on jan 13 1987 after 
customs officials discovered liquid explosives in his luggage in 
the following week two west germans were kidnapped in beirut both 
men have been freed 
hamadis brother abbas hamadi was convicted by a duesseldorf 
court of taking part in the kidnappings in a failed effort to 
pressure west germany into releasing mohammed

georgia rep doug barnard charged tuesday that 
export promotion programs run by the department of commerce are 
doing more to confuse american businesses seeking to market their 
products abroad than to help them 
barnard a democrat who heads the house government operations 
subcommittee on commerce consumer and monetary affairs said a 
general accounting office study requested by the subcommittee 
concluded that the departments management of trade shows and trade 
missions abroad is in a state of disorder 
instead of helping american businesses to get into the export 
business it seems that the commerce department is doing more to 
confuse and frustrate anyone who thinks about selling abroad 
barnard said this situation must be remedied without delay 
a draft copy of the gao report released by the subcommittee 
said about 55 percent of the major trade events scheduled abroad by 
the departments international trade administration in 1987 were 
canceled 
the gao the investigative arm of congress said the frequent 
cancellation of advertised trade shows or missions has limited 
the credibility of the program in the us business community and 
in some overseas locations 
desiree tucker a spokeswoman for the ita said the agency has 
reviewed the gao report and is preparing a written response 
major responsibility for export promotion programs abroad lies 
with the itas us and foreign commercial service which has 155 
commercial officers in 66 countries the agency which also has 
offices in 48 states had a 689 million budget in fiscal 1987 
with 392 million for foreign operations 
two other ita divisions share the responsibility for export 
promotion programs the gao said and a lack of coordination among 
the three units has resulted in poor planning and execution of 
trade events and a lack of accountability 
the gao also criticized the us and foreign commerical service 
for failing in three attempts since 1978 to develop a computerized 
trade information data base that would provide uptodate 
international marketing and trade information to government and 
business officials 
a very limited version of the data base is supposed to be 
operational by tne end of the year the gao said full 
implementation is expected to cost 399 million through 1993 not 
including the 134 million spent on the two previous attempts to 
computerize the trade data

secretary of state george p shultz in a move 
bound to reassure france said tuesday that eastwest troop 
reduction talks would not be expanded to cover nuclear weapons 
but it still was not clear when the negotiations might begin 
despite president reagans statement that they would open soon and 
discussions this week at the united nations 
the negotiations between the north atlantic treaty organization 
and the warsaw pact are intended to reduce nonnuclear forces 
tanks and other mobile weapons in europe 
french president francois mitterrand and defense minister 
jeanpierre chevenement during talks thursday in washington with 
reagan and defense secretary frank carlucci are expected to reject 
any soviet attempt to use the forum to promote nuclear weapons 
reductions 
france agreed to the negotiations only with reluctance the 
french are determined to protect their independent nuclear force 
from cutbacks under joint ussoviet pressure in fact france is 
planning to deploy a new tactical missile system 
shultz at a news conference here said flatly the talks will 
not be expanded to include nuclear weapons they are confined to 
conventional weaons 
the start of negotiations has been delayed by a dispute over 
human rights the united states has sought assurances from the 
soviet union that there would be a simultaneous improvement in 
human rights conditions in eastern europe 
the issue was discussed at meetings that soviet foreign minister 
eduard a shevardnadze had in washington last week with reagan and 
shultz 
us officials said afterward that the spviets had promised to 
release 27 political prisoners and to reform their emigration 
regulations 
reagan in a speech monday to the un general assembly said 
the eastwest talks would open soon 
both soviet deputy foreign minister vladimir petrovsky and 
british foreign secretary geoffrey howe in separate meetings 
tuesday with reporters said the chances were good the talks would 
be held this year 
assistant secretary of state rozanne l ridgway said however 
shevardnadzes visit to washington certainly did not erase all of 
the differences 
she said us officials reviewed the situation this week with 
west european allies attending the un session 
i think theres a sense here that the last issues have been 
defined she said but there is nothing that has been done here 
to specifically on a casebycase basis to change the 
situation

dozens of soviet readers got a tantalizing look 
tuesday at american books that most of them still cannot buy 
the exhibit of several thousand volumes is the latest foreign 
joint venture to offer western products for the foreign currency 
that few are permitted to hold soviets can order the books by mail 
from publishers 
soviets browsed among books such as an atlas with more detailed 
and accurate maps of their own country than those published by 
soviet map makers a handbook on future nasa missions fiction by 
oncebanned native authors and a book by soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev 
despite the currency limitations and the exhibits obscure 
location behind two gates and in a corner of an international 
exhibition hall the american organizers were grateful 
it aint gorky street a popular moscow shopping area 
acknowledged martin levin of the firm cowan liebowitz and latham 
of new york 
but gorky street is next on levins agenda he hopes a store 
that accepts soviet rubles will open within a year 
levin defended the current hardtofind site because having 
the soviet public come in is counterproductive as long as they 
lack the right money to spend 
only the few soviets with hard currency legally obtained through 
such means as a trip abroad and retained in a soviet bank account 
will be able to order books from the exhibit said dmitry mamleev 
deputy chairman of the state committee on publishing printing and 
book trade 
the yearlong exhibit will cater to soviet libraries and soviet 
businesses with hard currency such as dollars us publishers 
chose to send largely scientific and technical works sought by 
soviet institutional customers 
american fiction was nearly nonexistent the handful of volumes 
included alex haleys roots and tom wolfes the right 
stuff and bonfire of the vanities 
the books can be ordered for the regular us price plus 10 
percent but most customers will have to wait as long as four 
months for delivery according to the soviet governments 
distributor the international books agency 
alexander belostotsky deputy director of international books 
gave assurances that any book ordered through his agency will reach 
its buyer despite a soviet history of prohibiting individual 
importation of most foreign publications 
other joint ventures in the soviet unio with goods available 
only for foreign currency include baskinrobbins ice cream and 
british beer

its hard finding a good baby sitter these 
days especially when the baby in question is a chimp 
a few weeks ago joyce wriston lost her regular sitter for 
38pound herbie so she took out newspaper ads seeking a new one 
more than 75 people responded but wriston said choosing the 
right sitter was harder than it sounds herbie was in on the 
selection process 
he ushered one prospect right out the front door she 
said it was a woman who i thought would be really good with him 
but he just didnt accept her herbie walked her to the door and 
gave her a little push as she went out 
wriston finally picked indy snyder of soak creek who said she 
answered the ad because she loves animals 
snyder said her introduction to herbie was a bit unsettling i 
had never seen a chimp in my life i cant explain how i felt when 
i saw him come romping through the hallway she said 
weve had to spend some time getting to know each other its 
easier for him to get to know you than the other way around he 
seems to know exactly what you say to him 
herbies not your average chimp of course he wears clothes and 
shoes eats at the table watches tv and plays with toys he also 
showers dresses himself and brushes his teeth he has developed 
his own brand of sign language for communicating 
snyders responsibilities include preparing herbies food and 
seeing that he follows basic house rules 
being with herbie is more confining than caring for a child 
she said you cant send him out in the yard to play by himself 
you have to be right with him all the time

aquaculture production in the united states 
which includes fish farming has grown by 20 percent a year since 
1980 the agriculture department said tuesday 
production includes food and nonfood fish shellfish and 
aquatic plants the departments economic research unit said 
domestic production of food fish and shellfish amounted to an 
estimated 700million pounds in 1987 and was worth almost 550 
million at the farm gate compared with 203 million pounds and 191 
million in 1980 the agency said last year nonfood 
aquacultural production included among other items 715 million 
of baitfish and 23 million of tropical fish 
the report by the usda agency was the first in six years when 
aquaculture began to move up as an agricultural enterprise reports 
were issued in 1980 1981 and 1982 they were dropped after that as 
an economy measure 
during the 1980s americans have substantially increased the 
quantity of fish and shellfish in their diets despite the fact that 
seafood prices have risen considerably faster than those for some 
major competing sources of dietary protein the report said 
per capita consumption of all fishery products rose 18 percent 
to 202 pounds in 1987 from an estimated 171 pounds in 1980 
the largest sources of us fishery products are domestic wild 
harvests and imports the report said commercial fishermen landed 
a record 11 billion pounds of fish and shellfish last year with a 
wholesale value of 36 billion an increase of 18 billion pounds 
and 500 million from 1986 
imports were valued at a record 88 billion in 1987 led by 
17 billion worth of fresh and frozen shrimp lobster and tuna 
were next at 600 million and 500 million respectively

said tuesday he will introduce legislation to create a 14member 
panel to study the savings and loan crisis and make recommendations 
to the next president and congress early next year 
the bill to be sponsored by rep fernand j st germain dri 
is similar to legislation that passed the senate on friday 
the effort to create study commissions comes as debate is 
intensifying over the need for a taxpayer bailout of the federal 
savings and loan insurance corp federal sampl regulators say 31 
billion is required to rescue the industry however the general 
accounting office congress auditing wing and others say 50 
billion or more with at least some of it coming from taxpayers 
will be needed 
in july the house banking committee rejected another measure to 
create a study commission sponsored by rep stan parris rva st 
germain had objected saying that republicans would be too heavily 
represented on parris commission 
the 14member st germain commission would have six members 
appointed by democratic leaders in congress four by republican 
leaders and two by the reagan administration the next president 
would appoint the remaining two 
a st germain aide said the legislation would likely be 
introduced and acted on by the committee before the end of the week 
the senat bill sponsored by sens james sasser dtenn and 
bob graham dfla would create a 12member panel required to 
report to congress by feb 1 in addition to studying the sampl 
crisis the senate committee would examine the deposit insurance 
system for commercial banks 
meanwhile treasury secretary nicholas f brady as a step 
toward developing an administration recommendation for solving the 
sampl problem has ordered undersecretary george d gould to evaluate 
the conflicting estimates of the cost of bailing out the industry

violated a ban on calls for an election boycott the clergymans 
wife reported 
church colleagues confirmed that the rev tom mbabanes 
detention as the methodist and roman catholic churches released the

refusing to vote in nationwide municipal elections on oct 26 
also on tuesday a bomb exploded outside a police station in 
cape town damaging a door and breaking windows but causing no 
injuries police said 
most of the more than 50 bombings in south africa this year have 
been blamed on the outlawed african national congress guerrilla 
movement the government says the anc intends to step up its 
bombing and sabotage campaign in the weeks leading to the elections 
agnes mbabane said officers who took her 55yearold husband 
from his home at about 1245 am tuesday in the black township of 
soweto alleged that the minister had preached against participation 
in next months elections 
she said her husband had not advocated an election boycott but 
had conveyed the methodist churchs appeal to its congregations to 
consider carefully whether they should vote 
methodist leaders sent out a pastoral letter saying abstention 
from voting would be the only way for some voters to convey their 
rejection of apartheid the letter said only candidates who are 
openly and sincerely committed to the complete abolition of 
apartheid are worthy of christian support 
the southern african catholic bishops conference issued a 
similar letter 
mbabane is a regional vice chairman of the methodist church the 
chairman of his district the rev peter storey said in a

to remove someone of mr mbabanes stature and integrity from 
soweto at this tense time

activist clergymen defied the ban 
apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which 
south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs 
the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate 
districts schools and health services

the air force dissatisfied with the pace of 
safety improvements after a disastrous fire at a morton thiokol 
inc plant has begun docking the company a portion of contract 
payments for work on the mx missile the service and company said 
tuesday 
the company was notified on aug 30 that 15 percent of each 
months payment would be withheld said capt kathi blevins a 
spokeswoman for the air force systems command 
on sept 6 the first penalty was applied and the air force is 
now withholding 767208 from the firm the spokeswoman said 
we took this action because of thiokols lack of compliance 
with contract requirements in that the company has failed to ensure 
that its employees follow operating procedures and that there has 
been a general deterioriation of the housekeeping practices related 
to safety she added in a prepared statement 
morton thiokol holds two air force contracts calling for 
production of firststage rocket motors for the huge mx or 
peacekeeper nuclear ballistic missile one contract was awarded 
in fiscal 1985 and totals 935 million and the second was awarded 
the following year and totals 1443 million 
mortons manufacturing plant 25 miles west of brigham city 
utah was shaken by an explosion and fire on dec 29 1987 that 
left five workers dead the men were working in a special building 
known as a casting pit where solid rocket fuel is poured and set 
inside the rocket engines cylinder 
the company was fined last march by the state of utah for safety 
violations in connection with the accident a 1986 audit performed 
by the air force obtained after the accident complained of 
marginal industrial safety and fire protection procedures at 
the plant 
the air force declined tuesday to spell out in detail why it was 
now penalizing the company by withholding contract payments 
suggesting only that the firm had failed to meet the requirements 
of an action plan it put together to ensure safe operations 
after the fire 
the air forces prepared statement referred to deficiencies 
in operating procedures 
measurable improvements in safety and housekeeping procedural 
compliance must be accomplished before reinstatement occurs the 
statement said 
there is not a set date for compliance the length of time 
necessary to resolve deficiencies is dependent on thiokols 
ability to effectively ensure employee compliance with operating 
procedures 
rocky raab a thiokol spokesman agreed tuesday the company had 
been informed contract payments were being withheld but said he 
could not discuss details of what prompted the move 
were working very closely with them and we expect to get back 
in compliance with the contract before very long but it has been a 
difficult process raab said 
the spokesman said he could not predict when the company would 
satisfy the air forces concerns

in the aftermath of a dispute with three 
subordinates attorney general dick thornburgh on tuesday spelled 
out requirements governing contacts by justice department officials 
with members of congress 
in a memo to department officials thornburgh directed that all 
department personnel observe operating procedures to be sent 
from time to time by the office of legislative affairs headed 
by assistant attorney general tom boyd thornburgh also asked that 
department employees carefully follow the offices legislative 
guidance 
if we are to fulfill the duties and obligations of the 
department it is essential that we speak with one voice to 
congress thornburgh said in the memo which was distributed to 
reporters 
there has been and should contiue to be vigorous internal 
debate over legislative policy said thornburgh however once 
policy decisions have been made we should work together using all 
of our resources 
the request comes a week after three agency heads went to 
capitol hill and opposed a legislative compromise thornburgh had 
worked on to create an inspector general to investigate some 
components of the justice department 
in what department sources subsequently described as an angry 
meeting thornburgh bluntly told the three to drop their opposition 
to the compromise 
the three agency heads who spoke against the compromise to sen 
john glenn dohio were stanley morris director of the marshals 
service alan nelson head of the immigration and naturalization 
service and michael quinlan director of the bureau of prisons 
their agencies would be stripped of current internal inspection and 
audit powers under the legislation 
thornburgh had reluctantly endorsed the compromise saying the 
alternative would be a more drastic approach placing the entire 
department under the scope of an inspector generals investigative 
and audit authority 
currently the departments office of professional 
responsibility investigates allegations of wrongdoing within the 
department

the head of the justice departments 
antipornography unit is on administrative leave and under 
investigation for allegedly asking a department lawyer to destroy a 
document in a pending case department sources said tuesday 
acting deputy assistant attorney general h robert showers asked 
the lawyer this month to destroy the document according to sources 
who discussed the matter on condition they not be identified 
as a result of the allegations showers who was brought into 
the justice department by former attorney general edwin meese iii 
is now the subject of an investigation by the office of 
professional responsibility the sources said 
justice department spokesman loye miller would not comment 
the pending case involves avram freedberg a stamford conn 
man who owns a mailorder business promoting sexually explicit 
materials the sources said 
freedberg is under indictment in utah for using the mails to 
send out allegedly obscene advertising brochures magazines and 
videocassettes 
his attorney david kendall of washington filed a motion to 
dismiss the indictment last week in us district court in salt 
lake city utah 
freedbergs motion maintains that the indictment is tainted 
because the entire foundation of the prosecution is based on 
information which freedberg was required under federal criminal law 
to supply to the postal service 
the information consists of envelopes sent by freedbergs 
company containing allegedly obscene material which are marked 
sexually oriented advertisements 
in regard to data supplied under the selfreporting requirement 
freedberg is entitled under the fifth amendment to immunity from 
prosecution kendalls motion said 
in addition to the criminal matter freedbergs lawyers also 
filed a civil suit in federal court in washington in may against 
showers and other justice department employees alleging that the 
department was threatening to bring prosecutions against them in 
four jurisdictions 
us district judge thomas penfield jackson temporarily enjoined 
the department in june from proceeding in more than one district 
the utah indictment was then filed

the most rev edward c oleary announced 
his retirement tuesday as bishop of the roman catholic diocese of 
portland citing health reasons 
the announcement by the 68yearold bangor native came as a 
surprise 
oleary who has served for 14 years as spiritual leader of 
maines 278000 catholics will continue to administer the 
statewide diocese until pope john paul ii names a successor 
meeting with reporters at the catholic chancery oleary did not 
elaborate on his medical condition but acknowledged a history of 
blood pressure problems and said he has been on a lowsalt 
lowcholesterol diet for some time 
its just the general aging process i guess thats caught up 
with me he said adding that he consulted with medical advisers 
and concluded that he was no longer able to sustain the schedule 
responsibilities and expectations of his post 
people tell me now that ive never looked better perhaps its 
because i made the decision to retire that accounts for the 
healthful look he said 
oleary declined to speculate on his successor citing the 
confidentiality of the process it normally takes three to six 
months for the pope to name a replacement said marc r mutty 
director of communications for the diocese 
speculation immediately focused on maines auxiliary bishop 
amedee w proulx who was elevated to the episcopacy in 1975 
becoming the first francoamerican bishop in the states history 
and at 43 the youngest 
proulx who was not present at olearys announcement 
characterized the resignation as a sad loss for the diocese and 
praised olearys 42 years of service to the church 
oleary was educated at holy cross college in worcester mass 
and st pauls seminary in ottawa ordained a priest in 1946 he 
served in parishes in portland brunswick and old orchard beach

columnist carl t rowan testified tuesday that 
police officials told his son there would be no problem if 
rowan sr handled a weapon that he used to wound a teenager 
intruding in his backyard 
rowan an outspoken opponent of handgun use and possession has 
been charged with using an unregistered handgun in the june 14 
shooting of an intruder in his backyard if convicted of the 
misdemeanor charges the 63yearold syndicated columnist could 
face up to two years in prison and a 2000 fine 
in 1982 rowans son then an fbi agent left a 22caliber 
pistol in his fathers bedroom after the columnist had received 
death threats from persons purporting to be members of the ku klux 
klan rowan told a district of columbia superior court jury 
his son was told by district of columbia police officials that 
he had a blanket exemption from the citys tough handgun 
registration laws because he was a federal agent rowan also told 
the court 
earlier rowans son carl jr testified that twice in 1982 
and once when he was preparing to leave the fbi in 1983 he was 
told by police that he did not have to register weapons he had 
purchased for personal use 
after telling police that other members of his family might 
handle the weapon they told me that as long as the gun was 
where it lawfully should be if others have access to it it isnt 
a problem rowan jr testified 
rowans attorneys have maintained that the columnist and his son 
were given inaccurate advice by members of the police departments 
gun control unit about the citys gun registration policy which 
stipulates that a weapon can be used only by its registered owner 
a police official also testified that rowan broke the law by 
using the unregistered weapon but said he should not have been 
prosecuted because he apparently was defending his property 
police inspector james r lee introduced by rowans attorney as 
an expert witness on gun registration matters told the court that 
rowan was not authorized to handle the weapon used to shoot a youth 
who had taken an unauthorized swim in his backyard pool 
lee however testified that he would have recommended rowan not 
be prosecuted since a police investigation revealed that the 
columnist thought he was acting in selfdefense 
detective charles j jones who arrived at rowans house 
immediately after the june 14 shooting told the court that a 
sliding glass door at the rear of the house showed signs that 
someone had tried to force it open 
jones could not say when the door was damaged rowan had claimed 
that he shot benjamin smith 18 of chevy chase md because he 
was afraid smith was trying to enter his home 
jones also testified that evidence indicated that the shooting 
had taken place at close range near the door 
i dont see how we could be doing much better rowans 
attorney raoul carroll said after the proceedings

the house on tuesday approved a compromise 
spending bill appropriating 148 billion for the operations of the 
federal judiciary and the state commerce and justice departments 
for the fiscal year starting saturday 
the vote was 269141 on the measure worked out by negotiators 
for the house and senate which previously had approved two 
separate bills the senate has to approve the compromise bill 
before it can be sent to the white house for president reagans 
signature 
the total is 761 million or 5 percent more than was approved 
last year but 655 million or 4 percent less than the reagan 
administrations request 
although some agencies received major increases including the 
census bureau which is preparing for the 1990 census the budgets 
of some others were frozen or cut back 
these include the justice departments antitrust division and 
the us parole commission the commerce departments economic 
development administration the minority business development 
agency and the patent and trademark office the state departments 
maintenance program for buildings abroad and the commission on 
civil rights the federal trade commission and the office of the 
us trade representative 
the agencies which are required to absorb a recently approved 
41 percent pay increase likely will face hiring freezes 
furloughs and reductions in force 
the overall bill has a number of provisions unrelated to funding 
the federal communications commission for example is required 
to reverse a recent ruling and prohibit radio stations from 
broadcasting obscene or profane language at any time of the day or 
night the fcc had approved socalled adult broadcasting between 
the hours of midnight and 6 am 
the bill also creates the new position of special envoy to the 
afghan resistance with the rank of ambassador to coordinate us 
policy toward afghan resistance fighters

the rev barbara harris said tuesday she was a 
little incredulous at being elected the first female bishop of 
the episcopal church but she believes her historic status wont 
overshadow her work 
some members of the church have objected to bringing a woman 
into the line of apostolic succession but episcopalian officials 
said they dont expect the election will split parishes or stall 
the ratification process 
i have been elected bishop of the church and not a symbol 
or a token and my whole emphasis is on the role to which i have 
been elected harris said at a news conference at st pauls 
cathedral in boston where she was elected saturday 
i do not feel that much emphasis needs to be placed on what 
some people see as the historic or symbolic significance the 
58yearold philadelphia priest said 
a few no votes were heard when harris was elected to the 
position of suffragan or assisting bishop for the eastern 
massachusetts diocese but harris said she hasnt personally 
encountered opposition 
since i have no communication with some of those groups at the 
moment i would have nothing to say 
harris said she was shocked when she learned she had been 
elevated from associate at the church of the advocate in 
philadelphia to suffragan of the nations largest episcopal 
diocese with 155000 members 
the reaction that i have received has been overwhelmingly 
positive from bishops from fellow clergy from lay people 
throughout the country harris said 
the election touched off strong opposition in the church of 
england which does not elect women to the priesthood 
the bishop of london the rt rev graham leonard has said that 
he would be unable to recognize a woman bishop but harris said 
that is not a new development 
bishop leonard has said that for some time now she said 
the rt rev david johnson the bishop of massachusetts said 
questions about how harris would deal with opposition are 
hypothetical since she has not been consecrated yet adding that 
the two would work together on overcoming any possible resistance 
the election must be ratified by a majority of the bishops 
heading the nations 120 dioceses and a majority of the standing 
committees 
as a transitional measure parishes have the option of 
requesting that male bishops visit them if they feel they cannot 
accept a woman bishop but the request is only good for six years 
and johnson who voted against the measure would have to approve 
it he said he has not yet had any such request

sen brock adams dwash on tuesday branded 
as absolutely false allegations that he sexually assaulted a 
26yearold woman who spent the night at his home last year 
my family and i have been harassed by this woman for over a 
year a somber adams told reporters in his senate office as his 
wife betty stood at his side 
adams said the woman sought 400000 in hush money after the 
us attorney declined to prosecute the case i will not be 
blackmailed i am completely outraged these charges are 
absolutely false he said 
the woman was identified by adams and in a report she filed with 
the metropolitan police department as kari tupper her maiden name 
she has since married george bridges 
but adams 61 a former transportation secretary in the carter 
administration acknowledged he made an error in judgment by 
inviting the woman who he said was a longtime family friend he 
had known since her childhood to stay at his washington dc 
house on march 27 1987 when his wife was out of town 
he said he offered to let her sleep over because she was upset 
about her job and not feeling well the woman lived in suburban 
virginia 
looking back i should have called her a cab but at the time 
the suggestion seemed appropriate adams said in a statement he 
refused to answer questions beyond the statement 
the woman now married and living in seattle filed a report 
with the metropolitan police department on july 24 1987 alleging 
that her breasts and buttocks had been fondled while she was in 
adams house nearly four months earlier adams was not identified 
by name in the report 
she alleged that the incident took place between 915 pm on 
march 27 and 630 am the next day according to the report 
capt william white iii of the district of columbia police said 
the allegation of simple assault was investigated we consider 
the matter closed white told the seattle postintelligencer 
which reported the story tuesday the us attorneys office which 
prosecutes offenses in the district of columbia reviewed the case 
but did not press charges 
joseph di genova the us attorney at the time told the 
seattle times it was handled like any other case and nothing was 
found we reviewed and found it totally baseless 
the woman could not be reached and her husband refused to 
comment 
adams gave the following account of what happened last year 
he said the woman whom he had helped find a job on capitol hill 
after his election to the senate in 1986 had asked to meet him 
march 27 1987 at a swank italian restaurant in georgetown to 
discuss job opportunities 
when adams called her office that day to confirm the dinner 
date he was told she was ill assuming the meeting was off adams 
said he went to play tennis with three friends 
later that night the woman upset that adams had not showed up 
at the restaurant called him at his home to ask if she could drop 
by adams said the woman had visited the house in the past and had 
stored belongings in the basement 
after the woman arrived the pair went to a neighborhood 
restaurant but found it closed neither was feeling very well 
adams said so they returned to his home to get her car 
once there the woman went back inside the house at this 
point i told her i was exhausted and was going to sleep adams 
said 
i told her that she was welcome to stay at the house if she 
was not well enough to drive home she said she preferred to stay 
and then i went to bed alone i did not sexually assault the 
woman 
the woman was a legislative assistant with the house select 
committee on aging in 1987 when the alleged incident occurred the 
postintelligencer reported

a grand jury concluded that a black teenager 
concocted a story of rape and abduction by a gang of white men that 
led to months of racial tension and coverup allegations the york 
times reported wednesday 
the special state grand jury decided not to indict anyone after 
finding overwhelming evidence that 16yearold tawana brawley of 
wappingers falls lied and helped create the conditions in which she 
was found dazed wrapped in a garbage bag and smeared with 
excrement the times reported 
the black teenager claimed she had been kidnapped by a gang of 
white men on nov 24 and subjected to four days of sexual abuse 
but the grand jury in poughkeepsie concluded after more than 
100 witnesses and a variety of evidence that she had chosen not to 
return home and hid for four days in an apartment from which her 
family had recently been evicted the times said 
the grand jury speculated she may have feared punishment from 
her mothers boyfriend for her late nights out and that drugs and 
her relationships with shady characters may have played a role the 
times said 
miss brawleys story attracted national attention especially 
when she refused to testify on the advice of family lawyers and 
advisers who then repeatedly accused the state of a coverup and 
leveled charges against public officials and the news media 
the grand jury subpoenaed miss brawley but eventually abandoned 
hope of ever hearing her story firsthand and rescinded its vote to 
subpoena her the poughkeepsie journal reported tuesday 
prominent people who spoke sympathetically of her plight 
included heavyweight boxing champion mike tyson and actor bill 
cosby who put up a 25000 reward 
one of miss brawleys advisers the rev al sharpton said 
tuesday that he would not be surprised if the grand jury concluded 
as reported that miss brawley fabricated her claims 
we said from the beginning the grand jury would not come back 
with anything he said 
sharpton said the times article was nothing but a whole series 
of reckless speculations by someone who cannot back it up with one 
iota of fact 
the black activist repeated charges that the criminal justice 
system does not treat minorities fairly 
tawana is only the last race case that a grand jury has 
suggested was a fantasy sharpton told reporters outside 
brooklyns criminal court where he appeared for a proceeding 
stemming from his arrest last december at a civil rights protest 
he said miss brawley her mother glenda who claimed sanctuary 
in churches after she was sentenced to 30 days in jail for defying 
a subpoena to testify on the case and their attorneys would appear 
at a news conference in new york within 24 hours to respond to the 
report 
in addition to sharpton miss brawley and her family have been 
represented by attorneys alton maddox and c vernon mason 
the grand jury was not expected to comment on the brawley 
advisers tactics but attorney general robert abrams who was 
appointed special prosecutor in the case has said he will file a 
separate complaint against the lawyers when the grand jury report 
is released 
abrams issued a statement in response to the times report saying 
he would not confirm or deny the accuracy of any aspect of the 
story 
us attorney rudolph giuliani in manhattan said he was not 
surprised by the grand jurys determination as reported by the 
times 
its certainly worth a serious inquiry into whether lawyers 
involved in the case violated ethical rules of their profession 
giuliani said 
the grand jury completed its report friday but it still must be 
reviewed by state supreme court justice angelo j ingrassia the 
times said it is expected to be released within weeks the grand 
jury is to end its work oct 7 
miss brawley has moved with her family to virginia beach va 
where she is attending high school their telephone number is 
unpublished and the associated press was unable to reach the family 
for comment 
a neighbor who would not give her name said a van pulled up to 
the brawleys home tuesday and the family packed up and moved out 
but phil padgett senior vice president for oxford development 
corp in bethesda md which manages the virginia complex said he 
had no reason to suspect the family had moved and that they had 
paid rent through september 
the times said it obtained evidence summaries compiled in june 
and july as well as a summary dated july which contained all 
material presented to the grand jury by then and was the last one 
to be compiled 
abrams said he asked one of his deputies to investigate the 
unauthorized disclosure of grand jury material

the state department said tuesday it is 
premature to determine whether the new government in haiti is 
entitled to a resumption of american economic aid 
lt gen prosper avril haitis new president told a reporter 
in portauprince on monday that the goals of his 10dayold 
government coincide with conditions for us aid 
but state department spokeswoman phyllis oakley told reporters 
at this time it is premature to judge the new government of 
haiti on any of the conditions imposed by the united states after 
it suspended a 100 million aid program when violence halted last 
novembers elections under the government of lt gen henri namphy 
mrs oakley said that since the failed elections the united 
states has made it clear that we cannot consider resumption of 
assistance until we see concrete progress toward the 
establishment of an elected civilian government on economic 
development designed to alleviate the plight of haitis poor on 
respect for human and civil rights of all haitians and on 
cooperation with the us on narcotics traffic control issues 
the most recent developments have been encouraging she said 
but the emphasis will be on concrete progress in the meantime the 
us government has been providing 37 million worth of 
humanitarian aid through private and charitable organizations mrs 
oakley said

actress meryl streep played lobbyist tuesday 
when she urged lawmakers to approve stepped up safety regulation of 
26 billion pounds a year of chemical pesticides sprayed on crops 
im blatantly trying to draw attention to the issue mostly 
because of the safety of my childrens food supply streep told 
reporters as she arrived at the office of sen richard g lugar 
rind 
the senate is considering legislation that would sharply 
accelerate safety reviews of pesticides and the banning of those 
found too dangerous for use it would require manufacturers to pay 
for the process as well as the cost of storing and disposal of 
dangerous chemicals 
socalled government indemnity payments to pesticide makers 
whose products are banned 20 million so far would be ended 
under the plan to reauthorize the federal insecticide fungicide 
and rodenticide act 
streep expressed surprise at the pack of reporters waiting for 
her at lugars office but took it in stride brushing back a wave 
of blond hair and saying well hi guys a statement issued 
afterward by lugars office however said she was startled by 
press interest in her visit 
im obviously not a professional lobbyist the statement 
quoted her as saying im just sincerely concerned on a personal 
level this is a personal project ive adopted and im so 
interested in it that youre going to get sick of seeing me on 
these issues

by the year 2000 hispanics will outnumber 
blacks in new york state and 15 years later european whites will 
no longer be the majority population according to a new study 
indeed sometime in the first two decades california new york 
and texas will join hawaii as states with no ethnic majority 
according to the report the population and labor force of new 
york 1990 to 2050 released monday 
the rapid growth numerically as well as proportionately 
among groups who traditionally have not fared very well 
educationally or economically raises the potential for a twotiered 
social structure with nonhispanic whites and many asians at the 
top and most blacks and hispanics at the bottom said the 
authors leon f bouvier and vernon m briggs jr 
bouvier is an adjunct professor of sociology at old dominion 
university in virginia and vice president of the population 
reference bureau a private think tank which published the report 
briggs is a professor of labor and industrial relations at cornell 
university in ithaca ny 
the studys population projections for new york are higher than 
those of the us bureau of the census and the data center of the 
new york state department of commerce those two agencies expect 
the empire states population to reach 185 million by 2000 but 
bouvier and briggs say it may reach 196 million 
the two researchers also predict that the number of new yorkers 
of european descent will drop from 126 million in 1990 to 96 
million in 2020 and 52 million in 2050 meanwhile the black 
population will double from 28 million now to 57 million in 
2020 dipping to 48 million in 2050 
if the current high levels of immigration continue and the 
fertility rate among white europeans stays the same the number of 
hispanics in new york will increase from 25 million now to 56 
million in 2020 and 88 million in 2050 the report said 
over the same period the asian population will rise from less 
than 700000 now to more than 31 million in 2050 according to 
bouvier and briggs

disabled 
scott nelson 34 of davie said he now walks with a cane has 
had four knee operations in the past year and was about to enter 
the duke university medical center in durham nc for up to 
another year of treatment

america monitoring systems at the king faisal specialist hospital 
in riyadh saudi arabia he told congress that police picked him up 
from the hospital security office after he complained about 
hospital safety problems but said that to this day saudi 
authorities have never explained his detention 
i have no idea why nelson said in four years of trying 
to find out nobody has been able to give me an idea 
nelson said he was held incommunicado and tortured for 39 days 
they have a unique way of torturing people he said they 
shackle your hands and feet and make you do deep knee bends over a 
rod until they hear your knees break 
the torture and repeated beatings left him with a shattered 
knee ruptured disks in his back and partial damage to his sciatic 
nerve leaving one leg numb his knee was so badly damaged an 
artificial one may have to be implanted to save his leg which 
suffers from poor circulation 
im walking now but i have to use a cane he said ill 
always have the cane 
saudi authorities eventually released him telling him his 
detention had been a mistake and offering him increasing amounts 
of money he said

attorney when he insisted on pursuing the matter with the state 
department and congress the threats are under investigation by the 
fbi nelson said

arrest and imprisonment inhuman torture disruption of normal 
family life and mental anguish it does not specify monetary 
damages

not have any immediate reaction to the suit 
jorge duarte nelsons attorney said the case seeks to apply 
united nations human rights standards and international law to the 
court suit something that has rarely been done in the united 
states 
we expect it to be a groundbreaking suit duarte said 
prohibition against torture is fairly accepted worldwide 
nelson complained that us authorities were of limited help he 
praised us rep larry smith dfla who served on the house 
subcommittee but said the state department lost his files after he 
appeared on capitol hill 
he said the federal suit against a foreign government in us 
courts represents his best chance to get compensation for the 
torture and damage he suffered

yulia akselrod never knew her grandfather 
russian revolutionary leon trotsky and she has long rejected his 
ideas but she and her family suffered anyway for their lineage 
and now she is seeking justice 
mrs akselrod 52 who immigrated to the united states in 1979 
has written to soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev seeking 
posthumous rehabilitation for her father sergei sedov whom she 
never met though he was not a follower of his ostracized father 
he was exiled to siberia where he died 
heartened in part by the recent rehabilitation of scores of foes 
of soviet dictator josef stalin mrs akselrod said in a recent 
interview that the soviet government also ought to clear trotskys 
name and document his true role in the 1917 revolution 
trotsky once a leader of the revolution was expelled from the 
soviet union by stalin in 1929 
now 60 years later theyre trying to decide who was right or 
who was wrong mrs akselrod said theyre trying to do what an 
archeologist does brush dust from bones but theyre afraid to 
brush all the bones to admit the whole thing was wrong 
mrs akselrod a paint chemist living in new brunswick nj 
asked gorbachev in the letter dated march 18 to help establish the 
exact time and circumstances of her fathers death she said she is 
seeking information not compensation 
compensation would never cure the suffering what could i 
get what could i ask for she said i want the historical 
truth 
she said she has not received a reply to her letter 
the name of trotsky taboo since his denunciation by stalin was 
mentioned publicly for the first time in decades in a speech nov 2 
by gorbachev earlier this month the party newspaper pravda 
published an article acknowledging trotskys role in the revolution 
trotsky helped direct the 1917 coup that brought the bolsheviks 
to power served as a deputy to vladimir lenin and created and 
commanded the red army in a civil war against 
counterrevolutionaries 
trotsky whose real name was lev bronshtein envisioned a 
permament revolution that would spread across europe but after 
lenins death in 1924 trotsky lost a power struggle to stalin who 
preached communism in one country 
trotsky was expelled from the party deported and reviled as a 
traitor he left the country with his wife natalia sedova and 
their oldest son lyova an active follower of his father trotsky 
was assassinated in mexico in 1940 
under stalin those suspected of being trotskyites were 
hunted down and imprisoned or killed but sedov who had taken his 
mothers name in an effort to avoid persecution remained in the 
soviet union 
he decided to stay because he had nothing to do with 
trotsky and thought he was safe mrs akselrod said 
mrs akselrod remembers her mothers glowing accounts of her 
father as a man talented in science and math but dogged for most of 
his life by the legacy of his father with whom he never got along 
in 1936 about three months before yulia was born sedov was 
sent to krasnoyarsk in siberia in one of stalins sporadic 
crackdowns she said according to western historians sedov was 
given work as an engineer in a factory and later died in what 
soviet newspapers called an accident while trying to organize a 
mass protest 
natalia sedova later wrote that she was sure her apolitical son 
was murdered 
when mrs akselrod was nearly 2 her mother henrietta 
rubenstein was arrested yulia was sent to live with her maternal 
grandparents in moscow 
in 1951 when she was 15 her grandparents were arrested for 
being socially dangerous elements yulia was sent to an 
orphanage for three months then to prison to live with her 
grandparents for a month then she was shipped off to kolyma a 
small siberia village to live with her mother until her graduation 
from high school she said 
because of my youth i was never convicted or sentenced she 
said 
yulia returned to the moscow area in 1954 a year after stalins 
death studied chemistry and eventually married telling only two 
people of her past 
you cannot imagine russia in these years nobody could say 
that name out loud she said i was scared my whole life 
though life improved slightly under stalins successors mrs 
akselrod said she was determined to leave the country finally 
during detente with the trotsky name still taboo mrs akselrod 
emigrated with her husband and son 
her mother died last year in tallinn the capital of soviet 
estonia at age 77 with no other relatives alive in the soviet 
union mrs akselrod said she finally felt secure seeking more 
information about her fathers fate as trotskys son 
i do not hate him personally i just hate his ideas she 
said of trotsky this system killed me for 40 years it is his 
system his and lenins

lawmakers are still adding up the items in the massive money 
bill which covers everything from farm subsidies to food stamps 
but the total was between the 441 billion house level and the 
senates 473 billion 
under the measure produced by a housesenate conference 
committee spending on the export enhancement program would be 
capped at 770 million in the fiscal year starting saturday 
the administration had requested 900 million for the program 
under which major grain companies and other exporters are paid with 
surplus crops to spur exports of american farm products 
established under the wideranging 1985 farm law the program 
has been responsible for stepped up shipments of us wheat and 
feedgrains 
sen thad cochran rmiss had pushed for a larger amount but 
said the level approved would not put too large a crimp in the 
program 
i think this is a strong signal that we are at level of export 
assistance that will ensure that we will be able to sell in the 
international marketplace anything we have available to sell he 
said 
the committee also put a 200 million ceiling on expenditures 
under the targeted export assistance program which supplies aid 
for advertising and other promotion of american agricultural 
products overseas 
the program had been scheduled to increase to 325 million a 
year under the 1985 farm program it has been criticized in the 
house recently for providing taxpayer aid for the products of 
specific companies 
the conferees also adopted a compromise with the administration 
that would defer for one year a cut in the amount that production 
credit associations would have to pay to bolster the financially 
wobbly farm credit system 
production credit associations are local lending institutions 
that are part of the massive borrowerowned system which 
represents the nations largest farm lender the associations were 
required to pay assessments under a federal bailout passed by 
congress in 1986 
the reagan administration monday had called on conferees to drop 
the provision calling for a lowering of the assessment level 
threatening a presidential veto of the entire bill

mikhail s gorbachev asked the united states and 
pakistan on tuesday to come to their senses and stop arming 
guerrillas fighting the afghan government 
he said pakistan was trying to install leaders in afghanistan to 
its own liking no matter what the afghan people want he alleged 
in remarks carried by the official tass news agency that the 
united states has been increasing deliveries of weapons to the 
guerrillas including stinger missiles 
do they pakistan and the united states not contradict the 
spirit of the geneva accords and the interests of a peace 
settlement the soviet leader asked this is a very serious 
thing and we have a right to expect pakistan and the us to come 
to their senses and give up adventurist actions 
gorbachev made his comments at a luncheon for visiting laotian 
leader kaysone phomvihane 
under geneva accords signed in april the soviet union began 
pulling out its more than 100000 troops from afghanistan on may 15 
and is to finish by feb 15 soviet troops intervened in marxist 
afghanistan in december 1979 
the accords do not require a cutoff of soviet aid to its ally 
the afghan government or of us and pakistani aid to afghan 
guerrillas they do oblige the superpowers not to interfere in 
afghanistans internal affairs however 
gorbachev said problems in the afghan settlement were an example 
of a deficit of responsibility by some of our western 
partners

a federal judge on tuesday ordered the 
teamsters union to wait five days before mailing out ratification 
ballots on a newly renegotiated threeyear contract covering some 
20000 drivers of auto transport trucks 
us district judge royce c lamberth issued a temporary 
restraining order prohibiting the union from mailing the ballots 
until next monday after dissident teamsters complained that a 
quickie vote would preclude them raising a campaign to defeat 
the accord 
the teamsters had planned to mail out the ballots this wednesday 
on a new tentative contract reached with some 30 auto transport 
companies late last week 
an earlier tentative accord reached in july was rejected by 72 
percent of the covered members in the union prompting a reopening 
of negotiations that resulted in last weeks agreement 
both tentative accords provided for yearly 40 centsanhour pay 
increases or 25 percent annually for drivers now making about 
16 an hour the agreements also provided total increases of 30 a 
week in employer contributions to jointly administered pension and 
health funds for each covered worker 
the renegotiated pact eliminates new business concessions 
included in the earlier accord that had been opposed by 
rankandfile members and increases unloading pay in some areas of 
the country 
lamberth issued the order in response to a petition by two 
michigan members of teamsters for a democratic union a 
10000member dissident faction 
the petition claimed that the unions plan to mail out the 
ballots on wednesday six days after the new accord was announced 
was wellcalculated to prevent opponents from obtaining enough 
information about it to disseminate their views to fellow members 
the tdu dissidents had sought a 10day delay but an attorney 
for them claimed victory with lamberths order 
its not ideal but well take second best said paul levy 
a public interest law firm attorney retained by tdu if the 
ballots had been mailed out tomorrow we wouldnt have had time to 
get our leaflets out 
the union has set the third week of october for tabulating the 
ballots

an electronics expert said monday it was 
impossible for three ira members to have set off a radiocontrolled 
bomb from where they were standing when british soldiers claiming 
a bombing was imminent gunned them down 
michael scott a dublin electronics engineer told an inquest 
that he tested various radio transmissions from the site where the 
march 6 shootings occurred to a car parked about a mile away 
british commandos have claimed that they killed the three irish 
republican army guerrillas who were unarmed because they feared 
the guerrillas were about to detonate a radiocontrolled bomb in a 
car parked about a mile away 
but scott said even if the guerrillas had tried as an 
academic i must say it wouldnt have happened scott said walls 
and buildings would have blocked the radio signals 
scotts testimony came on the 16th day of an inquest by 
gibraltar coroner felix pizzarello and an 11man jury into the 
march 6 shooting deaths of mairead farrell 31 daniel mccann 30 
and sean savage 24 
the ira has acknowledged the three were on active service 
meaning they were on a mission to strike at british targets at the 
time of their deaths 
scotts testimony countered that of a senior british 
intelligence official and a bomb expert in the elite military 
special air service the squad whose members killed the ira 
guerrillas that witness said a bomb could have been detonated by 
remote control 
on monday a gibraltar constable claimed that farrell was 
reaching into her purse when the soldiers opened fire another 
witness a gibraltar resident who had been looking out her 
apartment window testified friday that farrell had been raising 
her arms in surrender 
the inquest has no power of prosecution its aim is to determine 
whether the shootings were lawful 
critics of british prime minister margaret thatchers government 
claimed the shootings are evidence of an unofficial 
shoottokill policy against members of the outlawed ira 
the mostly roman catholic ira is fighting to end british rule in 
predominantly protestant northern ireland and unite it with the 
irish republic the march 6 killings triggered a renewed round of 
ira attacks on british soldiers

george bush courted the middle class on tuesday with a modest 
plan to allow small savers to put something away for a rainy 
day and defer taxes on the interest michael dukakis criticized 
bushs proposal for providing average americans with a mere 20 
bucks a year while the rich receive a 40 billion giveaway 
the vice president got in the snappiest oneliner of the 
campaign day when he told an audience at miami university in ohio 
that a current television show reminds me of what interest rates 
might be if the democrats get back in again its called 
thirtysomething 
the democrats ridiculed right back 
asked what a dan quayle administration might look like 
democratic vice presidential candidate lloyd bentsen laughed and 
said very exciting asked later what he meant bentsen laughed 
again and said ill leave it at that 
republican vice presidential candidate dan quayle campaigned in 
bentsens home state of texas where he challenged dukakis to 
resign his membership in the american civil liberties union 
let him today resign from the aclu let him renounce all their 
bizarre positions let him make clear no more waffling and 
backsliding that he no longer supports the outrageous stands that 
the aclu takes quayle told a houston rally of asianamericans 
speaking before a crowd of several thousand people bush made a 
distinction for the first time about his opposition to the aclu 
which he uses as a device to attack dukakis as a liberal because he 
belongs to the organization 
i dont have a quarrel with their work in you know helping 
whatever position they take in terms of defending the right of an 
individual bush said but i just dont agree with the major 
positions that organization has taken in terms of legalizing 
pornography and its opposition to tax exemptions for religious 
institutions 
meanwhile a national poll released tuesday found that 
perceptions of sundays presidential debate as a dead heat have 
increased with a plurality of respondents saying there was no 
clear winner 
fortytwo percent in the abc news poll conducted monday night 
said the debate was a tie or didnt know who won more than double 
the 20 percent who expressed one of those views after the debate 
sunday night 
the poll of 416 likely voters also found that 34 percent said 
dukakis won while 24 percent said bush turned in the best 
performance the survey which included voters who had not seen the 
debate but had heard or read about it had a margin of error of 
plus or minus six percentage points 
the two vice presidential candidates are scheduled to debate on 
oct 5 in omaha neb and the jockeying for advantage already was 
well under way 
democrats have criticized quayle unsparingly during the 
campaign but in an apparent bid to raise expectations about the 
indiana senators debate performance bentsen characterized him as 
a skillful debater 
i think dan quayle is going to do very well in the debate 
said the texas senator he said quayle loves to debate on the 
senate floor and im not so confrontational 
the vice president upgraded his own selfevaluation in last 
sunday nights debate with dukakis i feel better today about the 
way the debate went than i did the night of the debate he joked 
about the handwringers on his staff who feared he would 
massively foul it up 
bush outlined his plan for a tax break for low and 
middleincome people in a speech in columbus ohio he called the 
program an individual savings account and said it would help the 
nation gain better control over our longterm economic future 
as well as help savers put something away for a rainy day 
one adviser said the tax deferred on interest the first year on 
1000 would save roughly 12 for a taxpayer in the 15 percent 
income tax bracket and slightly more in later years 
bush said the plan would allow many americans to lock up as much 
as 1000 a year in accounts of five years or more with federal 
income tax deferred when withdrawn the accumulated interest would 
be taxed at the savers income tax rate then in effect 
the tax break would be fully available to taxpayers with 
adjusted gross income of less than 50000 a year it would 
gradually phase out until it disappeared for someone with adjusted 
gross income of 60000 
bush officials estimated the program would benefit 8 million 
americans at a cost to the treasury about 70 million in 1989 and 
550 million by 1993 
bush proposed his savings plan after weeks of being criticized 
by dukakis for an earlier proposal to cut the maximum tax rate on 
capital gains 
speaking to a crowd in the chicago suburb of melrose park 
dukakis poked funs at bushs program juxtaposing the savings from 
the plan against the gop nominees proposal to cut the capital 
gains tax 
twenty bucks a year thats mr bushs solution for average 
americans dukakis said referring to his campaigns calculation 
of the plans financial benefits 
he says it will make them average americans and here im 
quoting better able to afford a home pay for college start a 
business twenty bucks a year whos he kidding 
in a statement dukakis said today after i pointed that out 
to him on sunday night he discovered the rest of america and he 
told just what his priorities are he wants to give the wealthiest 
1 percent of americans 30000 and the rest of us are going to get 
twenty bucks thats a new definition of trickledown 
earlier dukakis renewed his attack in an appearance in peoria 
ill calling the capital gains cut a fiveyear 40 billion 
giveaway to the wealthiest americans people making more than 
200000 a year 
the democrat also depicted bush as no friend of social security 
and medicare who cast a tiebreaking vote in the senate several 
years ago in favor of a plan to cut costofliving increases in 
federal benefits for retirees 
the first time george bush ran for the senate he opposed 
medicare and called it socialized medicine dukakis said the 
first time george bush ran for president he called social security 
basically a welfare program

police on tuesday arrested one of the 
leaders of last years bloody attempt to topple president corazon 
aquino and said the renegade colonel was recruiting dissident 
soldiers for a new coup plot 
brig gen rodolfo biazon commander of the manila district 
said lt col eduardo matillano was arrested before dawn in a raid 
on a hotel in quezon city after informants reported seeing him 
dining there 
biazon said matillano former constabulary chief in nueva ecija 
province was the chief recruiter of rightwing military 
dissidents and had been traveling throughout the country seeking to 
convert soldiers to his cause 
matillano played a major role in the failed coup on aug 28 
1987 that was led by former lt col gregorio gringo honasan 
who remains at large 
matillano led an assault on the government television station 
and a hotel near armed forces headquarters during the attempt in 
which at least 53 people were killed and more than 300 were wounded 
he was arrested a short time later and was charged with 
rebellion but escaped last april during a visit to a dentist 
honasan was arrested last december but fled a prison ship in manila 
bay also in april 
biazon said matillanos arrest followed the recent capture of 63 
followers of deposed president ferdinand marcos he said those 
arrests were kept secret for security 
he said honasans group apparently forged an alliance with other 
renegade officers linked to marcos adding matillanos capture 
severely cripples recent attempts by ultrarightist elements to 
destabilize the government 
elsewhere military chief of staff gen renato de villa ordered 
reinforcements sent to southeastern luzon on tuesday after 
communist rebels killed 10 soldiers and a civilian in a weekend 
ambush and captured five sergeants who were carrying a unit payroll 
worth up to 50000 
in another incident police said sgt victor dizon was driving 
to work in suburban malabon tuesday when four attackers fired 
killing him instantly 
police said the attack was similar to those used by communist 
rebels who have killed scores of police and soldiers in the

the house overwhelmingly approved legislation 
tuesday imposing sanctions against iraq as a concrete expression 
of outrage over that nations alleged poison gas attacks against 
kurdish villages 
the strongly bipartisan vote was 38816 
the legislation goes to conference with the senate which passed 
a far more punitive sanctions bill earlier in the month 
the house bill would impose sanctions on iraq in two bites some 
to take place immediately and others to go into effect if iraq 
continues to use poison gas 
the reagan administration opposes both the house and senate 
versions of the legislation on grounds that they would not bring 
us closer to the goal of ending iraqs use of chemical weapons 
in debate on the measure which took place monday evening some 
members said that sanctions would be counterproductive and hurt 
us business interests 
rep bill frenzel rminn said that while iraq apparently has 
been involved in a heinous act economic sanctions are unwise 
because they hurt american employers and american employees 
i think it is well intentioned but represents imprudent 
policy frenzel said 
house foreign affairs committee chairman dante fascell dfla 
replied 
there comes a time in the life of every nation where you take 
a strong moral stand and this is one of those times 
we must never yield to evil said rep john edward porter 
rill 
it is imperative that the response we give not be one of 
silence said rep howard l berman dcalif the bill before 
us is the first concrete expression of outrage against the use 
of chemical weapons 
fascell called the sanctions bill a measured response 
the 16 house members voting against the sanctions bill were

under its terms an immediate ban would be imposed on the export 
to iraq of weapons sensitive high technology and chemicals used 
in the production of chemical weapons 
if iraq continues to use chemical weapons the president would 
be authorized to impose further sanctions from a list included in 
the bill 
these include restricting the import of iraqi petroleum and 
other products restricting us exports including agricultural 
products denying us financial credits and credit guarantees 
downgrading diplomatic relations and opposing loans to iraq by 
international lending institutions 
the president is authorized to waive the sanctions required and 
authorized by the bill if he can certify that iraq is not using 
chemical weapons and has provided reliable assurances such as 
permitting onsite inspection that it will not use chemical 
weapons in the future 
the house ways and means committee softened the restrictions of 
the bill by permitting us exporters to continue to sign contracts 
with iraq until the president actually decides to restrict exports 
but in a separate action the house approved legislation tuesday 
that seeks to bar usx corp from selling its shuttered texas works 
steelmaking plant to iraq 
usx spokesman william p ryder said last week that the deal for 
the texas works plant fell through because a letter of intent 
expired on sept 21 without action by iraq 
the original language of the sanctions bill would have protected 
only those contracts signed before sept 15

foreign ministers from iran and iraq are 
to resume direct peace talks saturday in new york an official 
said the first meeting between the warring nations since peace 
talks fell apart in geneva on sept 13 
un secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar and a special 
mediator plan to meet separately friday with tariq aziz of iraq and 
ali akbar velayati of iran said francois guiliani the 
secretarygenerals spokesman 
the two foreign ministers then will have facetoface 
negotiations on saturday with perez de cuellar and the mediator 
ambassador jan k eliasson of sweden guiliani said tuesday 
the talks aimed at ending the 8yearold persian gulf war 
began in geneva on aug 25 five days after a unsponsored truce 
took effect 
negotiations bogged down over iraqs demand that the 
shaatalarab waterway iraqs only outlet to the persian gulf be 
cleared of sunken ships and silt as the next step in the peace 
process 
disputes over navigation rights in the waterway was a main cause 
of the war a 1975 treaty puts the border down the middle of the 
passage but iraq is seeking control of the entire waterway 
the un ceasefire resolution outlining an end to the persian 
gulf war also calls for the sides to withdraw to internationally 
recognized borders an exchange of prisoners of war and a formal 
determination of who started the conflict 
iraq initially endorsed the un ceasefire resolution in july 
1987 but iran did not accept it until a year later after a series 
of battlefield defeats

republican george bush criticized for 
advocating tax breaks for the wealthy proposed a plan tuesday that 
would offer taxdeferred interest to low and middleincome 
americans on longterm savings deposits 
bush said such individual savings accounts would help the 
nation gain better control over our longterm economic future 
by increasing savings 
americans have increasingly gotten away from the sensible 
frugality that says put some away for a rainy day bush said 
the dukakis campaign criticized the proposal as pitching 
pennies at the financial struggles of working families because it 
amounted to a tax break of 40 cents a week 
bush unveiled the proposal before the ohio republican state 
convention on his second visit to columbus in 11 days the state 
offering a prize of 23 electoral votes is a key battleground in 
the election fight 
in a later appearance across the ohio river in kentucky bush 
softened his assaults on the american civil liberties union which 
have become part of his attack on dukakis 
i need to carry ohio to win the presidency of the united 
states of america bush declared earlier in the day at a rally 
before thousands of cheering students at miami university in 
oxford ohio 
he was headed wednesday to illinois where he will take a bus 
tour 
as described by bush the savings plan would allow interest to 
accumulate tax deferred for funds put on deposit for at least five 
years a maximum of 1000 a year could be deposited 
when withdrawn the interest would be taxed at the savers tax 
rate then in effect 
michael boskin a stanford university economist who advises 
bushs campaign offered this example if a person put 1000 into 
such an account and if it paid about 8 percent annual interest 
that would yield about 80 in interest income 
for those in the 15 percent tax bracket that would defer some 
12 in taxes the first year slightly more in later years it would 
cost the treasury about 70 million in 1989 if that were the first 
year in effect growing to 550 million by 1993 bushs campaign 
estimated 
the full interest deduction would be available only to taxpayers 
with adjusted gross incomes of less than 50000 a year taxpayers 
with adjusted incomes of 60000 or more would not be eligible for 
the program 
bushs campaign staff estimated that more than 8 million 
americans would take advantage of the plan 
they will be helping themselves become better able to afford a 
home pay for college or start a business and they will be helping 
america by increasing investment and economic growth bush said 
bush has been repeatedly attacked by dukakis for advocating a 
cut in the maximum capital gains tax from its current level of 33 
percent down to 15 percent most people who pay the tax are charged 
about 28 percent 
dukakis speaking in a chicago suburb said the bush savings 
proposal would yield the average family 20 a year twenty bucks 
a year whos he kidding dukakis said 
today after i pointed that out to him on sunday night he 
discovered the rest of america and he told just what his priorities 
are he said he wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of 
americans 30000 and the rest of us are going to get twenty bucks 
thats a new definition of trickledown 
bush campaigned later tuesday at a rally at a riverfront park in 
owensboro ky after a brief ride on sightseeing boat on the ohio 
river when a reporter tried to ask bush about the minimal impact 
of his savings plan the question was interrupted and drowned out 
by the blaring noise of the boats horn 
thank you very much bush said turning away with a smile 
speaking before a crowd of several thousand people bush made a 
distinction for the first time about his opposition to the aclu 
which he uses as a device to attack dukakis as a liberal because he 
belongs to the organization 
i dont have a quarrel with their work in you know helping 
whatever position they take in terms of defending the right of an 
individual bush said but i just dont agree with the major 
positions that organization has taken 
in his columbus speech bush avoided any attack on dukakis and 
tried to set a tone of compassion 
the answer is up to us he said the answer is in each 
individual act of kindness multiplied by thousands and tens of 
thousands the answer is in a new engagement in the pain of 
others 
at miami university bush entertained the students with a series 
of barbs aimed at dukakis 
referring to a television series bush said theres a tv show 
that reminds me of what interest rates might be if the democrats 
get back in again its called thirtysomething

an international team of arbitrators has ruled 
that israel must return a disputed beachfront resort area to egypt 
israeli media reported tuesday 
the ruling which has been under consideration since may 1987 
is to be announced thursday in geneva 
israel captured taba a beach resort along the red sea in the 
1967 middle east war and retained the property when it returned the 
sinai desert to egypt in 1982 
the dispute over the 250acre area has been a key sticking point 
in egyptianisraeli relations the two countries signed a 
usmediated peace treaty in 1979 
israel radio and newspapers said the arbiters who have visited 
the site and studied old maps and thousands of documents from both 
sides had decided to return all the property to egypt 
a foreign ministry official declined comment on the reports but 
said israel planned to honor whatever decision the arbiters reached 
he noted that if taba were returned to egypt some compensation 
would likely have to be made to israeli citizens who own a hotel 
and a beach resort along the halfmile beachfront 
in cairo egyptian foreign ministry officials said president 
hosni mubaraks government was so confident the arbiters will 
decide in egypts favor that the ministry already was preparing a 
statement to be issued after the announcement 
a staterun trave agency in cairo misr sinai tourist co has 
begun advertising trips to the taba area now taba is the talk of 
the whole world said the advertisement in the englishlanguage 
egyptian gazette 
in israel prime minister yitzhak shamirs hardline likud bloc 
and foreign minister shimon peres leftleaning labor party clashed 
over taba an issue expected to surface in the elections campaign 
israels parliament elections are scheduled for nov 1 
the likud said if the decision goes against israel it would be 
proof of its contention that israel cannot expect a fair hearing 
from an international body and should not agree to an international 
conference on middle east peace 
we should not agree beforehand to the demands of the other 
side likud legislator ronnie milo said on israel army radio i 
accuse shimon peres and labor officials who threaten that if we 
dont accept some demand everything will collapse 
peres who favors an international conference said he still 
believed israel could sign a peace treaty with neighboring jordan 
without necessarily returning all the territory it occupies as was 
the case with egypt 
im also not sure we had to reach such a treaty with egypt 
but i supported it because it was the only one in the field he 
said on the radio in a telephone interview from new york 
peres is scheduled to meet with his egyptian counterpart esmat 
abdelmeguid in new york on thursday the two leaders are expected 
to work out how to implement the ruling 
the fivemember taba arbitration team is made up of swedish 
chief arbitrator gunar lagergren pierre bellet of france dietrich 
schindler of switzerland hamed sultan from egypt and ruth lapidot 
from israel 
israel also captured the gaza strip from egypt and the west bank 
from jordan in the 1967 war

democrat michael dukakis appealing to 
mainstream americans assailed george bush on tuesday as an 
enemy of social security and medicare who might cut both programs 
the democratic presidential nominee traveled to the city that 
has become a symbol of middle america to combat his republican 
rivals suggestion that he is outside the nations mainstream 
if you want to see the difference between george bush and me 
on the things that concern mainstream america look at where we 
stand on social security and medicare dukakis told a rally 
outside peorias city hall 
he said bush had called the medicare health plan socialized 
medicine while running for the senate years ago and that in 
1980 while a presidential candidate bush called social security 
basically a welfare program 
when it comes to social security and george bush dont read 
his lips read his record dukakis said in a remark that turned 
around bushs read my lips declaration he would not raise taxes 
he was wrong then and hes wrong now the democrat said 
later during a speech in the chicago suburb of melrose park 
dukakis riduled a proposal made tuesday by george bush to allow 
small savers to sock away up to 1000 a year and defer paying 
taxes on the interest 
twenty bucks a year thats mr bushs solution for average 
americans dukakis said referring to his campaigns calculation 
of the benefits from the plan 
he says it will make them and here im quoting better able 
to afford a home pay for college start a business he said 
twenty bucks a year whos he kidding 
today after i pointed that out to him on sunday night he 
discovered the rest of america and he told just what his priorities 
are he wants to give the wealthiest 1 percent of americans 30000 
and the rest of us are going to get twenty bucks thats a new 
difinition of trickledown 
dukakis fell on his face when he tripped while climbing stairs 
to the stage at the melrose park event he got up showed no sign 
of being injured or upset and shrugged it off when asked about it 
later 
it happens in every campaign at least once he said 
while there he was presented with a shirt bearing the name 
eureka college an illinois school that is president reagans alma 
mater 
on the back were the words we like dutch but we love the 
duke 
seeking to encourage the notion that he had tightened the 
presidential race with a strong debate performance two days 
earlier dukakis escalated his assault on bushs views on social 
security and medicare 
the massachusetts governor repeatedly referred to his debate 
performance asking the peoria crowd how many of you thought i 
won and drawing a thunderous cheer 
he said bush said our family farms must be doing just fine 
in the debate 
he must be kidding dukakis said saying there were 200000 
family farms and half a million farmrelated manufacturing jobs 
lost in eight years 
dukakis said both social security and medicare were likely 
targets for bush to cut to finance additional defense spending and 
to offset a cut in the tax on capital gains a tax break dukakis 
contended would primarily benefit the wealthy 
he recalled bushs tiebreaking senate vote to cut 
costofliving increases for social security and repeated his 
suggestion that bush might tap the social security trust fund 
now if mr bush wants another tax giveaway for the rich and 
if he cant think of a single weapons system in the budget that he 
opposes and if he says hes going to bring down the deficit 
then hows he going to do it without raiding the social security 
trust fund and trying to cut social security and medicare again 
dukakis said 
my friends he added social security is not a welfare 
program social security is a contract between generations and 
i will never break that contract 
dukakis campaigned in illinois a tossup industrial state a day 
before bush was taking an eighthour bus trip across the state 
dukakis appeared with former democratic rival sen paul simon in 
peoria the city recalled in political memory for the nixon 
administrations reference to it as a barometer of middle america

officials running a police training school 
tuesday defended an exercise session that hospitalized 16 cadets 
including one who required a liver transplant 
the cadets were treated at hospitals beginning sept 19 the 
first day of classes with ailments ranging from exhaustion and 
dehydration to kidney failure 
gary f egan executive director of the massachusetts justice 
training council said no cadet was denied water during the 
training and that activity on the first day was no more strenuous 
than any other groups first day at an academy 
there was strenuous physical activities as there always was 
on that first day but we have found no one that was denied 
water upon request egan said at a news conference 
the most seriously ill cadet timothy shepard 25 a pittsfield 
police trainee collapsed while running on the track and has been 
in a coma for a week 
he received a liver transplant early tuesday at 
presbyterianuniversity hospital in pittsburgh and remained in 
critical condition 
mike purcell of northampton who quit the edward j connelly 
criminal justice training center after one day said recruits were 
required to exercise vigorously and were kept moving with pushups 
and laps if they failed to respond quickly to orders 
we started at 730 am with a formation with our gear our 
jackets boots and other stuff in a duffel bag weighing 50 to 60 
pounds and we had to walk to classes carrying the duffel bag 
above our heads with one arm he said 
we also moved metal lockers and heavy wood furniture from the 
basement up to either the second or third floor of the building 
he said everybody was pushed to the limit before we even got to 
the physical training part 
george f grady the states chief epidemiologist said the 
cadets who became ill at the training facility in agawam suffered 
from dehydration and exhaustion 
law enforcement officials said they would investigate training 
routines at massachusetts police academies 
nearly three dozen police chiefs from western massachusetts have 
asked the state attorney general to have an independent agency 
investigate the academy 
john p mchugh chairman of the training council said the 
council the state attorneys general office and state police would 
investigate training procedures in the academies 
hopefully the councils mission will be to correct this so it 
wont occur in the future mchugh said 
but grady said we feel at this time that the cause of illness 
was a relatively insufficient intake of water relative to the 
amount of exercise they were doing 
the executive office of public safety oversees the council 
which certifies the states 12 police academies egan said that 
stressful situations are often introduced as part of the 
training to see if any of the cadets may react improperly 
wed rather have them do it in the academy than out in the 
streets egan said 
asked if it was the cadets who were at fault for not drinking 
enough water egan replied some of them were unaware of the fact 
that they were doing damage to themselves they had a chance to go 
home every night to rehydrate 
several stricken cadets told reporters that they could not 
comment on their experiences at the training facility without 
permission from their supervisors but one former cadet said the 
training routine was severe and that trainees were allowed only two 
cups of water before shepard collapsed 
ive been through basic training in the army and it was twice 
as bad as that said purcell the doctors told me that if i had 
gone back for a second day i could have suffered permanent kidney 
damage 
a spokesman at the baystate medical center springfield hospital 
said that shepard also suffered kidney problems and several of the 
other cadets received kidney dialysis treatment six remained 
hospitalized 
after cadets were urged to seek medical examinations 21 were 
found to exhibit symptoms from fatigue and nausea to kidney failure 
dr constance lentz of the university of massachusetts in 
amherst said tuesday that she treated three to eight holyoke cadets 
suffering from fatigue and kidney problems after their first day at 
the academy in 1984 
i wish in retrospect that i had pushed harder for them to 
protest the severity of their training she said

sen lloyd bentsen told michigan business leaders 
tuesday that with republican george bush at the helm the american 
economy would sail into the bermuda triangle of debt deficit and 
dependence 
the democratic vice presidential candidate said he and michael 
dukakis were tough experienced economic managers who would tackle 
us trade and budget deficits and unlike bush would strictly 
enforce the new trade law aimed at opening up foreign markets to 
american products 
the texas senator began a fourday campaign swing with a visit 
to this key industrial state where public opinion polls have shown 
a close race between bush and dukakis with 20 electoral votes at 
stake 
mike dukakis and i both have a long record of success when it 
comes to dealing with the economy bentsen told the detroit 
economic club 
mike took a state that was an economic basket case and turned 
it around as a businessman as a senator and as chairman of 
the finance committee i have made it a point to look for honest 
bipartisan effective answers to americas economic problems 
he touted dukakis call for expanded publicprivate partnerships 
and said promised an activist democratic president willing to 
listen closely to the needs of business and industry 
by contrast he said the reaganbush administration has stood 
idly while the united states lost its edge in research and 
development of new products and deficits piled up leaving the 
nation reliant on foreign bankers to finance its debt 
from detroit bentsen went to kansas city mo where he 
criticized republican vice presidential nominee dan quayle for 
leading the unsuccessful opposition to a law giving workers 60 
days notice before they are laid off 
but dan quayle lost the fight against plant closing and the 
american people won bentsen told an airport crowd of about 250 
were going to open the quayle season a little early this year 
bentsen also applauded dukakis performance in his sunday debate 
with george bush 
he finally got george bush out of that flag factory and 
talking about the issues he said 
bentsen was spending the remainder of night preparing for the 
debate next week in omaha neb he had several briefing books with 
him 
bentsen told the detroit business leaders that since president 
reagan took office eight years ago the federal budget deficit has 
nearly tripled the trade defict has grown to nearly a 
halftrillion dollars and the united states has been transformed 
from the largest lending nation to the largest debtor nation 
those are the facts and as president reagan has suggested 
facts are stubborn things bentsen said to me and to mike 
dukakis the facts suggest that staying the course putting this 
country on automatic pilot is not an acceptable thing not when 
the course leads to the bermuda triangle of debt deficit and 
dependence 
he said us trade representative clayton yeutter has been 
putting out the word that if george bush wins this election you 
wont see any change theyre not going to provide rigorous 
enforcement of that trade bill 
said bentsen that would be a disaster for america and no 
city knows it better than detroit 
tailoring part of his speech to bluecollar workers bentsen 
said income in michigan has grown slower than the national average 
and domestic car production has fallen during the economic recovery 
that reagan brags about 
bentsen is to visit president trumans birthplace at 
independence mo on wednesday and deliver a speech that aides 
said would compare his credentials for the vice presidency with 
those of quayle 41 an indiana senator

hospital authorities on 
tuesday reported the first three deaths of palestinians from the 
armys newly introduced plastic bullets which have stirred 
controversy and drawn a un protest 
the army confirmed the deaths all in the gaza strip but said 
in all three cases it still was checking to determine the cause of 
death 
the palestinian hospital officials who spoke on condition of 
anonymity for fear of retribution have proven reliable in the past 
in providing information on palestinian casualties 
defense minister yitzhak rabin on tuesday defended plastic 
bullets as a useful tool in dealing with violence in the occupied 
west bank and gaza strip and acknowledged they could increase 
casualties 
the plastic bullet is intended to hit stone throwers 
organizers and inciters of demonstrations outside the range of the 
rock rabin told a news conference at a military camp in beit el 
about 12 miles north of jerusalem 
the fact that there are more casualties among the rioters for 
the same number of disturbances that is exactly our aim 
rabins comments indicated a change in the armys firing rules 
soldiers previously could not fire tear gas and rubber bullets at 
protesters unless their lives were threatened in a 
lifethreatening situation the soldiers could use regular lead 
bullets 
these were the deaths blamed by hospital officials on plastic 
bullets 
osama braikah 17 of gazas khan yunis refugee camp died 
after a plastic bullet pierced his heart tuesday during a clash 
with troops in the camp said an official at nearby nasser hospital 
an army official confirmed the death but said he did not know if 
a plastic bullet was the cause he acknowledged plastic bullets 
were used to break up a stonethrowing mob tuesday at khan yunis 
aiman abu sharar 17 died in gazas nuseirat refugee camp 
after soldiers shot him in the chest tuesday with a plastic bullet 
hospital officials said 
the army confirmed the death and said plastic bullets were 
probably used in nuseirat but that it could not give the exact 
cause of death 
jihad zanoun 27 of gaza city died monday after he was hit in 
the chest by a plastic bullet doctors at shifa hospital said 
the army confirmed zanouns death and said it was checking 
whether he was shot by a plastic or a standard lead bullet 
a fourth shooting death was reported tuesday but officials 
could not say whether hussam gharbawi died from a plastic bullet or 
lead bullet gharbawi was wounded in clashes in gaza monday and 
died tuesday in tel hashomer hospital near tel aviv the army and 
arab reports said 
the deaths raised to 278 the number of palestinians killed since 
their uprising began on dec 8 six israelis also have died 
on tuesday at least 26 palestinians were wounded in clashes 
with israeli troops in the occupied lands hospitals reported 
the army said two injuries were confirmed and other reports were 
being checked 
the latest casualties followed an upsurge of violence in the 
occupied lands monday that left two other palestinians dead and at 
least 67 wounded the violence accompanied a general strike in the 
territories to protest israeli imprisonment of palestinians israel 
took the territories from jordan and egypt in the 1967 middle east 
war 
the plastic bullet has greater range and impact than rubber its 
introduction last month sent arab casualties soaring and drew calls 
for limiting its use 
the un relief and works agency which aids palestinian 
refugees protested to the army noting that woundings in the gaza 
strip alone jumped from 19 in july to 130 in the first 25 days of 
september 
a senior un official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
casualties have risen to an unacceptable level and that growing 
use of plastic and lead bullets cannot be justified 
rabin said his job was to reduce violence other protests 
with all due respects are of secondary importance to me 
israel television said snipers fired plastic bullets after 
troops first fired in the air in several cases the use of 
plastic bullets in an improper manner and against the orders has 
caused fatalities it said without elaborating 
an army spokesman said standing orders were that plastic bullets 
were fired only by specially trained officers and aimed at the 
legs but he could not confirm the procedure was fulfilled in every 
case 
dr elias artin of gaza citys ahli arab hospital said in an 
interview that plastic bullets tended to do less damage than lead 
bullets but could kill 
they can kill if they hit the chest abdomen or neck he 
said if they hit a nerve they can paralyze 
he said he treated several patients with wounds to the central 
body one patient took six plastic bullets one in the abdomen 
artin said

four advocates for homeless rights were 
arrested tuesday night when they refused to leave the capitol hill 
office of rep joseph kennedy 
the two men and two women charged with unlawful entry were 
among eight boston homelessrights advocates who staged an allday 
sitin at the massachusetts democrats office in an attempt to 
force the congressman to endorse a 20 billion housing bill 
the bill sponsored by rep barney frank dmass would provide 
75 million units of affordable housing it rivals kennedys 
proposed community housing partnership act which would allocate 
500 million in federal matching funds to nonprofit affordable 
housing projects 
after meeting with kennedy in his office eight demonstrators 
said they would stay put until the congressman pledged to support 
franks bill 
the group had been protesting inside kennedys office since 11 
am and four refused to leave when asked by the congressmans 
staff said capitol police officer dan nichols 
nichols said they are scheduled to be arraigned in dc superior 
court on wednesday they face a possible 500 fine andor up to six 
months in prison 
jim stewart an organizer for the protesters had said earlier 
the group of constituents four of whom are homeless traveled to 
the capitol in hopes of putting momentum behind the frank bill 
by lobbying members of the massachusetts congressional delegation 
the least we can do is risk arrest here until we convince joe 
its the right thing to do he said adding that kennedys 
housing bill is inadequate to the need of the homeless 
aides to kennedy who is a member of the housing and community 
development subcommittee said the congressman has reservations 
about the frank bill because it is too expensive and does not 
clearly spell out how the money is to be used 
joe just feels theres a better bill out there said chuck 
mcdermott a kennedy aide adding that kennedy also supports other 
measures that would provide for construction and rehabilitation of 
public housing

a new nasa launch directorate met 
tuesday to clear the shuttle discovery for its thursday liftoff 
hearing an excellent review of the 15 billion spacecrafts 
readiness but holding off giving a goahead for the final 
countdown 
in general the whole picture is very good for going flying 
the day after tomorrow said former astronaut robert crippen who 
heads the launch oversight panel created to overcome management 
problems that contributed to the 1986 challenger disaster 
crippen said the group was focusing on two items and needed to 
be certain neither would imperil nasas first manned mission in 32 
months 
launch is scheduled for 959 am edt on thursday with the 
final countdown to begin early wednesday evening the weather is 
probably the biggest question mark said crippen 
cloudcovered skies and atlantic winds loomed as always as a 
possible threat air force spokesman mike beeman forecast a 20 
percent probability of bad weather at launch time but added 
thats pretty low historically launches have been delayed 40 
percent of the time because of weather 
the outlook didnt brighten much late in the day weathermen 
still were predicting widely scattered showers in the area 
discoverys five astronauts went over their flight plan and 
relaxed with their wives as the ship sat surrounded by work 
platforms on launch pad 39b heat shields removed for engine 
checkout were back in place and engineers checked guidance and 
navigation systems inside the cargo bay the tracking and data 
relay satellite tdrs to be placed in orbit just six hours after 
launch a similar satellite was destroyed in the challenger 
catastrophe 
one of the hardware items still in question was an oring in the 
satellite propulsion system the other involved a small jet 
thruster aboard the orbiter itself a component that could be 
bypassed if need be 
the 100 million datarelay satellite had already been approved 
for flight when nasa discovered a problem with similar hardware 
being prepared for flight next february 
crippen said an examination of the inertial upper stage ius 
rocket that boosts the satellite to its final orbit indicated 
damage in the oring that seals the pressure needed to gain thrust 
for orbit the oring is not the same part that failed in leading 
to the 1986 challenger disaster 
nasa needed to be certain the flaw was not replicated aboard 
discovery crippen said air force col dennis e beebe said 
experts believed the oring was damaged as part of the 
installation procedures and so the problem would not also exist 
on the satellite aboard discovery 
crippen said the shuttle cargo bay would not be opened for 
inspection of the satellite but that propulsion experts would 
conduct tests overnight on other such rockets to make sure they 
dont leak 
you have heard they have a great deal of confidence theyll be 
able to come in and tell us tomorrow that they think they are 
prepared to fly crippen said 
the report was due at another meeting of the oversight team at 
10 am 
delivery of the satellite is discoverys main mission in nasas 
longawaited return to space and the space agency would not likely 
launch without being sure there was no problem 
the shuttle fleet has been grounded since jan 28 1986 when a 
booster rocket failure destroyed challenger and took the lives of 
seven astronauts many nasa workers were wearing green ribbons on 
their workclothes this week to signify their hopes for a safe 
liftoff and successful mission 
a lightning alert delayed the final preparation of 
discoverys powerproducing fuel cells tuesday morning but the 
countdown was not affected the countdown was to enter a 19hour 
hold at midnight a cushion that gives nasa time for testing the 
satellite oring 
commander frederick h hauck and pilot richard o covey were up 
at dawn tuesday practicing landings on the kennedy space center 
runway in an aircraft that handles like a shuttle the threemile 
runway would be used if a launching problem forced the shuttle to 
return home 
at the launch control center engineers were checking electronic 
readings from the ship 42 miles distant at 140 am edt 
thursday a halfmillion gallons of supercold fuel will pour into 
the shuttles tanks aiming for the nationally televised liftoff 
the 21person launch oversight team consists of top officials 
from each of 17 units responsible for shuttle procedures or 
components in their first meeting ever they gathered tuesday to 
air any problems that might surface the rogers commission which 
investigated the challenger accident found that engineers 
opposition to launching in cold weather never reached the ears of 
key nasa launch officials 
crippen one of several former astronauts who have moved into 
key shuttle management posts since the accident heads the unit and 
has sole authority to stop a launch the launch directorate is on 
call all through the final 48 hours 
hauck covey and mission specialists george d nelson david c 
hilmers and john m lounge reviewed countdown and flight procedures 
and underwent physical examinations they also received a weather 
briefing 
nasas rules tightened since challenger forbid launching when 
there is lightning or rain within 10 miles of the pad winds of 
more than 17 knots about 20 mph from the south or 24 knots 28 
mph from any direction would automatically scrub the liftoff

panamas acting president manuel solis 
palma told the general assembly tuesday that us drug charges 
against gen manuel noriega are false and part of a us attempt to 
extend its control of the panama canal 
solis palma said panama was waging a battle against narcotics 
traffickers noriega and panama were victims of a us propaganda 
war that could turn into armed conflict he declared 
ambassador vernon a walters the chief us representative to 
the united nations described solis palmas allegations as lies 
against the united states by gen noriegas handpicked chief of 
state 
noriega head of panamas 15000member defense forces is 
considered the real power behind the civilian government headed by 
solis palma 
in panama a government official said 26 activists arrested last 
week were planning to overthrow noriega under a usdevised plot 
the noriegacontrolled national assembly named solis palma as 
panamas chief executive in february after ousting president eric 
arturo devalle the united states still recognizes devalle as 
president 
noriega was indicted in florida last february on federal drug 
trafficking charges and devalle attempted to fire him noriega 
denies wrongdoing

campaign is nothing other than a sinister tissue of lies and 
falsehoods carried out by the united states government

impose another committed to renegotiation of the panama canal 
treaty he said 
under provisions of that treaty the united states agreed to 
relinquish operational control over the canal on dec 31 1999 
the united states has frozen millions of dollars in panamanian 
assets and witheld millions of dollars more in aid to force noriega 
from power 
solis palma warned that hostile us economic moves might turn 
into war 
my government has more than enough reason to fear direct 
military aggression by the united states against panama he said 
walters denied charges of impending invasion and said panama 
was already a seriously troubled economy 
walters said he stayed away from solis palmas speech to 
emphasize that the united states does not recognize him as 
president

marines who were called 
in to help fight fires in yellowstone national park this summer 
began leaving tuesday and officials expressed concern that gusting 
winds might whip flames across containment lines 
an approaching cold front increased wind speeds at the park 
tuesday afternoon 
with the winds theres always concerns about fire activity 
said park spokeswoman sandy robinson 
one area on the 107500acre wolf lake fire that firefighters 
worried about was along the western edge of the grand canyon of the 
yellowstone 
theyre watching for spots on the other side because the 
eastern slope of the canyon is heavily timbered said robinson 
so they obviously do not want the fire in that area because of 
the potential for spreading 
elsewhere in yellowstone little activity was reported on the 
400100acre north fork fire that earlier this month swept around 
the old faithful geyser complex although fire managers were 
concerned about the strong winds they said higher humidity levels 
would help keep the flames in check 
there were a few hot spots in the mary lake area and they had 
firefighters camping out last night at spike camps said 
robinson but today all firefighters have been brought into the 
base camps because of the wind and cold weather 
still conditions improved enough in the past few days to allow 
640 marines to pack up their gear for the return trip to california 
about 500 civilian firefighters remained 
officials estimate that since the fires began as much as 60 
percent of an area covering more than 16 million acres of 
yellowstone and surrounding national forests has been burned 
to the east of yellowstone in the shoshone national forest 
firefighters were attacking a section of the 413410acre 
clovermist fire that monday had slopped over the border into 
montana 
theyve pulled most of the crews from the mopup effort 
elsewhere on the clovermist to try to corral that fire said 
spokesman tom mitchell

settlement generated by afghanistan must not be allowed to break

the state has filed product tampering 
and extortion charges against an unemployed construction worker who 
claimed he found a 6inchlong decomposed mouse in a can of coors 
beer 
james harvey 30 claimed he found the mouse july 27 harvey 
who sought between 30000 and 50000 from the brewery as 
compensation refused a 1500 offer from the adolph coors co for 
the can and the mouse 
separate courtordered studies at the university of florida and 
coors headquarters in golden colo including an examination of 
the dead mouse concluded the animal was placed inside the 16ounce 
can after it left the brewery in may 
were alleging extortion said mcrae it certainly had to 
do with allegations of communications with the adolph coors co to 
seek 35000 out of this transaction 
assistant state attorney e mcrae mathis said the coors case is 
similar to the tylenoltampering case a few years ago in terms of 
public reaction 
he added that the case may be the first filed under a statute 
passed in july 1987 that strengthened penalties for tampering with 
a product to injure a person or company 
mcrae said coors officials reported a 16 percent loss of sales 
nationwide since news reports about harveys allegations coors 
spokesman david goldberg said tuesday that the figure was lower but 
would not give an exact number 
authorities believe harvey has left florida but duval circuit 
judge r hudson olliff set bond of 50000 
harvey could face up to 15 years in prison for each of the 
seconddegree felony charges if convicted 
the beer company would not comment but earlier this month 
coors filed a civil lawsuit in duval circuit court accusing harvey 
of fraud and deceit product disparagement defamation and 
attempted theft by deception no specific cash amount was named

the first usflagged kuwaiti tanker to 
sail without a close escort of us warships left kuwait tuesday 
heading south through waters where three mines have been discovered 
in the past five days 
although traveling alone the 81283ton oil products carrier 
surf city would not be unprotected should trouble arise us 
military sources said 
shes on her way and will be under surveillance at all 
times said one source insisting on anonymity attacks on 
commercial shipping stopped aug 20 when iran and iraq declared a 
ceasefire in their 8yearold war 
however fears of mines were heightened with reports that 
italian minehunters found an explosive device floating in the 
southcentral persian gulf the third such discovery in five days 
and the fifth since aug 19 
iran is considered responsible for virtually all gulf mines 
irans navy commander said tuesday that irans territorial 
waters in the northern gulf are cleared of mines as are major 
parts of the international waters the official islamic republic 
news agency reported in a dispatch monitored in nicosia cyprus 
irna quoted rear adm mohammedhussein malekzadegan as saying an 
iranian warship and two guided missile boats arrived in the 
northern gulf ports of imam khomeini and mahshahr after clearing 
the shipping channels in khur musa of mines khur musa is the 
extended bay leading to the two ports 
us naval experts estimate that about 200 mines remain in the 
gulf 
us warships were to monitor the surf citys twoday passage 
from patrol stations along the 550mile track through the gulf and 
the strait of hormuz 
the missile frigate uss vandegrift trailed the tanker at a 
distance but for the first time no warship was sailing in close 
convoy with it the sources said 
the unescorted voyage reflected president reagans decision 
announced monday to scale back the navys role in the escort 
program 
the closequarter convoy operation formally ended monday when 
the uss vandegrift delivered the 294739ton supertanker townsend 
to kuwait after escorting it through the gulf 
that movement was the 67th this year and the 89th since july 
1987 when washington agreed to reflag 11 kuwaitowned tankers to 
protect them from iranian attack 
us officials say its first ocean convoy operation since world 
war ii proved successful by assuring the export of billions of 
barrels of kuwaiti petroleum products 
some us diplomats and officials say it also forestalled soviet 
efforts to gain greater influence in the waterway that provides 
nearly 20 percent of the noncommunist worlds petroleum 
kuwaits support for iraq made its shipping a special target of 
iranian gunboats during attacks the white house said reduced 
tensions made possible the navys reduced role 
administration officials say the new policy might allow the 
withdrawal of one ship the 26member fleet now includes 16 in the 
gulf and a carrier battle group in the arabian sea 
the missile cruiser uss vincennes was withdrawn earlier this 
month and was not replaced 
the pentagon also has curtailed air patrols and other escort 
activities that cost had been estimated by us officials at 20 
million a month 
nine americans were killed in helicopter and jet crashes during 
the operation 
other incidents included the mining of the supertanker bridgeton 
in the first convoy july 24 1987 an iranian silkworm missile 
attack that disabled the tanker sea isle city at kuwait and the 
nearsinking of the frigate uss samuel b roberts by a mine april 
14 
the us forces retaliated wrecking two oil platforms and 
sinking or damaging six iranian naval craft in an attack april 18 
on july 3 the vincennes mistook an iranian jetliner for an 
attacking military jet and shot it down killing all 290 aboard

a sixstory apartment building on a 
steep hillside collapsed tuesday killing a man and his baby son 
and leaving at least four people trapped in the rubble officials 
said 
authorities said the building may have been weakened by 
hurricane gilbert which hit this northern industrial city on sept 
17 and caused widespread flooding that killed at least 140 people 
in the area 
at least four people were rescued after the collapse said state 
prosecutor alejandro garza garza 
a woman her clothes torn and covered with blood was pulled 
from the debris she told rescuers someone else was trapped there 
as she was carried away on a wooden stretcher a man ran up took 
off his shirt and said here my daughter take this 
juan francisco rivera the attorney general of nuevo leon state 
identified the woman as maria eugenia gonzalez de rodriguez about 
26 wife of the man who died and mother of the dead baby 
rivera said at least four people were believed still inside the 
building earlier he said five people were believed trapped but 
officials later determined that the sixth floor had been empty when 
the building collapsed 
rivera reported that he called off all but 10 of the 100 
rescuers at 130 pm because of dangerously shifting rubble 
the movement could be dangerous for those who are alive 
rivera said we are trying to approach it more technically 
garza identified the dead man as antonio rodriguez 25 to 30 
years old and said he did not know the name of the baby boy 
the lower floors of the 3yearold building pancaked atop one 
another but the top three levels slid about 250 feet down the 
hillside the rubble stood about one story high with mattresses 
clothing furniture and crushed air conditioners half buried 
the building in a wealthy area of the city was one of the 
highest structures in monterrey 
francisco javier nakashima an investigator with the state 
judicial police said heavy rains from hurricane gilbert must have 
contributed to the collapse he said the structure was reported 
leaning to one side six months ago 
ruben salinas garcia 27 who was in his second floor apartment 
at the time said he didnt realize what was happening until the 
building was falling 
i woke up and the roof was on top of me he said at the 
scene he said his maid apparently still was trapped inside the 
builidng 
his face and pink tshirt were covered with blood and a bandage 
covered his chin

state health officials declared 
tuesday that it is safe for hundreds of former residents to return 
to love canal the neighborhood that became world famous for 
chemical contamination 
state health commissioner dr david axelrod said most areas of 
love canal contain no more chemicals than other neighborhoods in 
the industrial city 
the longawaited finding was hailed by love canal residents who 
feared that the neighborhood would not be resettled but would be 
left vacant as a symbol of environmental disaster 
weve been waiting for this for 10 years said nunzio 
loverdi who lived in a housing project in love canal ill be 
the first to move back 
former resident lois gibbs who heads a washingtonbased 
environmental group pointed out however that the state had not 
removed all the chemicals dumped in the area in the 1940s but had 
merely contained the hazard and cleaned up some residential areas 
as part of the state ruling a task force of local officials 
will create a plan to resettle the community and assist homeowners 
in renovating their homes many of which have fallen into disrepair 
hundreds of families had been awaiting the decision to determine 
whether they can return to the homes they left 10 years ago when 
president jimmy carter declared the area a national disastr as 
many as 80 other families were hoping the study would confirm their 
decision to stay in their homes near the former chemical dumpsite 
niagara falls mayor michael olaughlin said the decision will be 
good for the city 
it wont mean a landslide of people moving back olaughlin 
said but it will mean the city will begin to put the nightmare 
behind it 
axelrod met with some 200 residents of the area tuesday night to 
announce his findings 
at first residents were angry and frustrated at not being able 
understand axelrods technical presentation but the mood lightened 
as it became clear that most residents were getting good news 
axelrod recommended however that some blocks were still unsafe 
affecting about 10 families 
i wont move he can just forget it said one of the 
residents kathy atkins she said her home had been tested before 
and found to be free of chemicals 
axelrod said some homes in areas deemed unsafe may have been 
found to be free of high levels of contamination but residents 
still should move because the surrounding areas had higher 
concentrations of chemicals 
peter slocum spokesman for the state health department said 
that people such as atkins may be allowed to move into other homes 
in the neighborhood 
the goahead for resettlement will add to a revitalization under 
way in the area 
phyllis festor president of the niagara falls board of 
realtors said the city is having a real estate boom 
the decision has been so long in coming that for most people 
it doesnt matter anymore ms festor said 
home prices in the love canal area have risen in each of the 
last three years from an average of 35000 to 40000 she said 
ms festor who lives two blocks from love canal said people 
arent frightened by the prospect of living near the site its a 
secure area with nice homes that are just right for people starting 
out she said 
love canal an abandoned waterway project was used by the 
hooker chemical co to dispose of thousand of pounds of chemical 
wastes in the 1940s the company made herbicides and pesticides 
in the 1950s the canal and its contents were covered over and 
homes and an elementary school built it wasnt until the early 
1970s that people began to notice foul smells in their basements 
and oily puddles in their yards 
they also began to notice higherthanusual incidences of 
miscarriages birth defects cancer leukemia neurological 
disease allergies epilepsy and suicide 
in all 728 homes in a 50block area were evacuated and the 
elementary school and 228 houses torn down 
the state and federal government filed multimilliondollar suits 
against the companys parent occidental chemical corp much of 
that litigation is still pending 
the dumpsite has been fenced off and surrounded with clay and 
plastic liners to prevent the chemicals from leaking into the air 
or groundwater corroding drums of chemicals have been separated 
and complex runoff and monitoring systems built 
most homes in the immediate area of the dumpsite are boarded up 
and decaying

the nations welfare system is headed for a 
major overhaul with the conclusion of complex negotiations on a 
fiveyear plan aimed at moving welfare recipients into jobs and 
helping them collect more child support 
the initiative agreed on monday by senate house and white house 
negotiators had been close to death all summer as negotiators 
sought a balance between conservatives favoring mandatory work and 
liberals concerned about increasing benefits to the needy and 
motivating people to enter the mainstream workplace 
the 334 billion welfare plan comes in above the senates own 
28 billion measure but would cost less than half of the initial 
71 billion plan passed by the house

basic skills jobs program offering welfare parents including 
those with preschool children services such as job search help 
education and job training child care and transportation aid would

swedish 
navy ships are constantly on the hunt for alien submarines in the 
baltic but the intruders just as constantly elude them in a maze 
of islands and underwater mountains 
its like fox hunting said cmdr lennart danielsson 
skipper of this flagship for swedens antisubmarine warfare unit 
you have to stretch him to be after him all the time so that at 
last hes so tired that he makes a mistake 
so far the fox has escaped but the hunters say they are getting 
closer 
the navy believes that during a threeweek chase in june a 
prowler may have been wounded under a barrage of depth charges and 
antisubmarine grenades but the vessel slipped away 
we almost managed this spring said danielsson on the bridge 
of the hms stockholm during a training exercise i think we will 
get him in a couple of years 
the stockholm with a crew of 29 men and three women spends two 
weeks a month at sea patrolling and following up some of the 
hundreds of reports from citizens claiming to have seen a periscope 
or a diving sub sometimes the invader turns out to be a frisky 
seal or swimming moose 
the antisubmarine unit can muster two corvettes 12 submarines 
seven minelayers 16 patrol boats and 12 helicopters all equipped 
with the latest sonar 
one or two ships is not enough against a submarine 
danielsson said the tactic is to box in the intruder with sonar 
signals from all directions then close in and open fire 
because it has never snared an intruder the unit has had a 
credibility problem foreign experts have suggested the swedes may 
prefer to let the intruders go to avoid a diplomatic fuss 
danielsson said that wasnt true 
sweden which has not fought a war since 1814 dismissed the 
submarine threat until 1981 when a soviet sub ran aground near the 
naval complex at karlskrona the incident jarred swedes into 
understanding their neutrality was no defense against foreign 
military adventures 
experts who investigated a 1982 engagement also concluded the 
other intruders were also soviet submarines and sweden lodged a 
diplomatic protest with moscow the inquiry also disclosed the 
existence of previously unknown minisubs launched from conventional 
submarines equipped with caterpillar tracks to crawl on the seabed 
reexamining previous incidents the swedes concluded that the 
soviets had been violating swedish waters since the early 1960s 
although the navy claims many confirmed sightings of alien subs 
the swedish government has not made any formal accusation against 
any nation 
the most recent engagement began aug 27 off the west coast 
north of goteborg but the chase was abandoned after two weeks 
the government has said it lacks the evidence to substantiate a 
charge against any specific country for that incident the soviets 
deny their ships are involved and have suggested the incursions are 
imagined 
navy analysts believe that in wartime the soviet union would 
want to neutralize swedish defenses to allow its ground and air 
forces to transit scandinavia 
the baltic is one of only three sea outlets on the soviets 
western front the others are the frigid barents sea north of 
sweden and norway and through turkeys narrow bosporus strait into 
the mediterranean 
to danielsson a 41yearold career officer it doesnt matter 
whether the prowlers are from the west or the soviet bloc his job 
is to stop them 
danielsson said the intruders usually come in groups of six two 
conventional subs and four minisubs which can slip into the 
innerarchipelago of some 24000 islands often they operate in 
several squads at the same time along the coast to tax swedens 
defense resources 
their mission is pure intelligence to learn everything there 
is to know about our coastal defenses danielsson said 
danielssons 330ton corvette is armed with artillery and depth 
charges that could sink a sub but much of its weaponry is intended 
to punch holes in the hull of a sub and force it to the surface 
rather than destroy it 
the ship bristles with the latest electronics its operations 
room is crammed with radar sonar and television screens like a 
darkened arcade of spaceage video games 
but submarines have the advantage of the underseas terrain 
a craggy mountainous seabed provides camouflage along a coast 
that stretches 4750 miles 
a strange mixture of varying water temperatures and salinity 
work to deflect the hunters sonar and a junkyard of wrecks and 
metalic rocks bounce back a confusing blizzard of sonar beeps 
we have learned a lot since 1982 and the first thing we 
learned was that it is much harder than we thought to catch a 
sub said danielsson 
he can go down to the bottom and pretend to be a rock or he 
can move away very fast danielsson said and the normal chances 
of finding him are less than one 1 percent 
the incursions are so politically sensitive that the commander 
said he would not be surprised if the intruders blew themselves up 
rather than surrender 
these are pros not amateurs we will never see a submarine 
coming up and waving a white flag he said

a senator has called on his 
congressional colleagues to slow down on investigations the 
probes he said often never end and keep legislators and other 
officials from more useful work 
i have nothing against such investigations per se sen rene 
saguisag said but i dont think that when we were elected last 
year we would be let loose we 200plus members of congress to 
investigate everyone and everybody 
whatever is in the headlines today tomorrow it will be 
investigated 
he added that the communist insurgency continues and crime 
increases because generals and police chiefs spend too much time 
answering questions at congressional hearings 
saguisag made his appeal for a cutback on probes during a 
television talk show discussion with sen juan ponce enrile who 
took the opposite view just hours before the show enrile called 
for yet another investigation the 73rd pending before the 
23member senate 
the bicameral congress reconvened last year for the first time 
since it was abolished in 1972 by the nowdeposed president 
ferdinand e marcos since resuming sessions both houses have 
initiated scores of probes on controversies chiefly brought out by 
manilas freewheeling press 
the probes involve subjects ranging from the countrys 28 
billion foreign debt and alleged corruption to religious cults and 
whether gold bullion is buried under an old spanish fort or if two 
missing bargeloads of rice are really in the bottom of the sea 
in early september when a top player in the philippines 
professional basketball league was benched for no specified reason 
during a championship series congress launched an investigation 
in some cases investigations have made matters worse 
after a recent congressional factfinding trip to the southern 
philippines sen leticia ramos shahani openly accused malaysia of 
annexing six filipino islands her accusation led to calls by other 
legislators and officials for action just short of war 
mrs shahani later apologized however saying she failed to 
verify an allegation made by a naval officer who had misread a 
navigational chart 
saguisag a harvardtrained lawyer complained that in many 
cases the probes fade into oblivion after media interest wanes 
often investigations would never have been started if congressmen 
had bothered to think twice about them he said 
im dumbfounded by the lack of preliminary staff work 
saguisag said 
enrile the lone opposition member of the senate recently 
called for investigations into alleged corruption involving 
relatives of president corazon aquino and the sale of a lot in 
california last year 
just before the tv show he asked for an investigation into what 
a newspaper called a list of economic saboteurs prepared by 
finance secretary vicente jayme which included unidentified 
legislators 
enrile maintained on the show that probes were necessary to help 
legislators gather information to prepare legislation in cases of 
alleged corruption involving presidential relatives he said 
congress should investigate because no one else will 
saguisag said that if investigations were unavoidable 
congressmen should be more restrained in what they say in their 
sessions about other people who might be slandered and have no 
means of redress because congressmen enjoy immunity 
saguisag acknowledged nevertheless that as chairman of the 
senates ethics committee he himself is conducting several probes 
asked by program host luis beltran what punishment congress can 
give erring congressmen saguisag replied that in the 1950s a 
member of the house was suspended for 15 months because he made 
false charges against the president 
i am willing to be suspended for 15 months enrile said i 
can use it for vacation but if i will get suspended for the error 
of information i received i expect that an equal measure will be 
applied to a senator of the ruling coalition who has brought us to 
the brink of war 
that was a reference to mrs shahani and her erroneous charge 
against malaysia

mention liberace and many words spring to mind 
before tasteful 
that however is exactly the word for abcs twohour movie 
biography of the flamboyant entertainer airing sunday 
liberace is eversocareful with the image of the performer 
who died in february 1987 of complications from aids thats due no 
doubt to the fact that this production was sanctioned by his estate 
and allowed to use his fabulous home cars costumes and jewels in 
the filming 
another liberace movie will follow a week later on cbs 
the abc version is insistently simplistic and adoring even 
while constantly raising the question of his sexuality liberace 
always denied he was a homosexual and his spokespeople always 
denied he had aids the movie strongly hints that he was gay and 
does make plain that he died of aids 
andrew robinson stars as liberace rue mcclanahan plays his 
mother john rubinstein plays his longtime confidante jamie james 
robinsons liberace inexplicably a dark brunette throughout 
the movie even though liberace was fairhaired is kind gentle 
and good dedicated to his public and his beloved mother his 
sexual preference is a nagging unspoken problem 
when he announces his intention to marry a young woman he has 
met at church jamie abruptly excuses himself from the room the 
womans father calls off the wedding because of rumors and 
fears that liberace and his daughter would never produce 
grandchildren years later when liberaces sisterinlaw surprises 
him by setting him up with an adoring female fan he rushes from 
the room in embarrassment 
scott thorson the companion and employee who filed a palimony 
suit against liberace in 1982 is portrayed by marius valainis as 
an opportunist who turned on liberace after he was fired as 
liberace explains the relationship to jamie its something about 
strays about being needed 
at one point after the thorson affair becomes public liberace 
is asked pointblank by a reporter if he is homosexual he answers 
the question by saying he doesnt believe that entertainers 
should publicly air their sexual or political tastes 
but he adds with a name like liberace which stands for 
freedom im for anything with the letters lib and that includes 
gay lib 
if the filmmakers wanted to avoid dwelling on liberaces love 
life they could have spent more time on his music there are 
several musical numbers mike garson was the piano standin 
though robinson does a good job of faking it but liberaces 
proficiency at the piano seems to be maintained magically since he 
is never shown to have any particular passion for the instrument 
instead theres shallow pop psychology for instance his 
musician father walked out on the family just before christmas so 
liberace was determined that every christmas thereafter would be 
happy and trivia he first saw a candelabra on a piano in the 
movie a song to remember 
to its credit the movie never aspires to be anything more than 
an affectionate portrait of a kind man who gave his all and the 
best scenes are in the concluding montage a triumphant liberace 
performs an exhausting sellout run at radio city music hall in 
1986 while backstage he struggles against the disease that will 
kill him within months at one point he admits to jamie that he 
regrets never having had children even though he always said his 
21 dogs substituted for them 
at the end of the movie the words appear on the screen 
wladziu valentino liberace died from complications relating to 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome on february 4 1987 
this is followed by a brief epilogue in which robinson as a 
young liberace comes out and sits at a piano lit only by the 
candelabra id like to be remembered as a kind and gentle soul 
who made the world a little better place to live in because i lived 
in it he says then he blows out the candles one by one

came of them mississippi is one of six states where such church 
homes are unlicensed and rarely scrutinized but as this summer 
began a boys tale of beatings neglect and imprisonment brought 
state authorities to bethels door and ignited a conflict fueled by 
outrage from both sides gates of hell is the story of these 
children who have been given pseudonyms to protect their 
identities as required by mississippi law of their lives inside 
bethel and of the emotional struggle over their futures and their 
souls this is the first installment of three

kathy prine had just finished stabling her horse when the phone 
rang sunday may 8 it was after 7 pm 
as a child welfare investigator in george county she was used 
to calls at all hours seven days a week it was the sheriffs 
office another runaway from bethel that wasnt unusual the 
baptist church homes 10year history was rife with kids trying to 
escape its rigorous regimen 
prine had dealt with some of bethels children but had never 
seen the operation firsthand because the state does not license 
its churchrun boarding homes and therefore cannot regulate them 
it rarely ventures in 
among those who have some call them hospitals for the soul 
others consider them spiritual torture chambers 
the truth about the bethel home for children was a matter of 
opinion 
in 1980 a runaway brought assault charges against bethels 
founder the rev herman fountain for a beating he received with a 
switch licks fountain called them after a hearing the 
youth court judge removed all the children and directed the church 
to follow certain regulations but the charges were dropped and the 
order was never enforced many of the children were returned to 
bethel 
since then other children had run away and others told stories 
of abuse and neglect but few had been at bethel long enough to be 
credible witnesses the kind whose stories would hold up in court 
now there was patrick

he had come to bethel in october 1986 at age 13 a sometime 
truant sent from florida by his mother 
life might have been hard at home but bethel was like boot camp 
with a wrathful god as drill sergeant patricks description was 
the same as those of other children and that of herman fountain 
himself 
each day had a schedule up at 5 am so many minutes in the 
bathroom so many minutes to dress so many to clean the dormitory 
there were prayer sessions morning and evening 
in the summers the children picked beans pulled weeds on the 
churchs 28 acres dug ditches picked up trash and cared for 
bethels menagerie of goats horses ducks and deer sometimes 
crews of children would tear down abandoned buildings including 
some at keesler air force base in biloxi and return with what they 
salvaged to bethel where it would become part of new structures 
they built themselves 
there was no payment for work but plenty of punishment for 
slackers 
in the winters they had bible memorization and school lessons 
came from religious workbooks often children had to erase other 
childrens answers to fill in their own 
like every new bethel charge patrick spent his first month on 
watch under the eye of more trusted child children on watch were 
allowed to speak only to designated individuals it was a way to 
prevent them from planning escapes talking on watch meant sure 
punishment

there were no calls to parents for the first two months and no 
visits for the first six 
incoming mail was opened and money was removed letters home 
that complained about bethel were ordered rewritten telephone 
calls when allowed were monitored 
meals were heavy on oatmeal grits and rice at the end of the 
week leftovers were mixed together a meal the kids called 
compost stew failure to eat everything on the plate brought 
punishment 
no cigarettes drugs alcohol or carbonated drinks were allowed 
there was no television no radio no movies these worldly media 
were of the devil so were newspapers magazines and most music 
except certain religious selections at night trusted children 
guarded the doors against runaways no one was allowed out 
this was the program steeped in fundamental religion rooted in 
biblical principles and imbued its supporters said with the 
lords power to change incorrigibles into godfearing cleanliving 
christians and anyone who deviated from it in word deed or 
spirit learned a lesson about pain 
patrick had learned those lessons well

mark maples questioned patrick closely maples had been george 
county prosecutor only since january but he had already 
interviewed several former bethel children 
the 30yearold maples had grown up in george county and he 
knew a little about bethel in a town the size of lucedale with 
2500 residents it was hard to avoid some days at lunchtime 
bethel preachers stood out on main street hollering about hell and 
damnation to passersby 
that usually prompted stories from the patrons at the nearby 
coffee pot restaurant but mostly they left the subject alone 
after all they figured none of the kids out there was local they 
probably were bad kids who deserved what they got 
now this boy was telling maples stories as awful as any he had 
heard it would take testimony from those whod left earlier and 
knew patrick and two more who would leave after his escape to 
corroborate his treatment from the day he arrived to the day he 
fled herman fountain

in 1969 fountain was a heroin addict dabbling in witchcraft he 
had forsaken his native oklahoma for the streets of new york in 
three years he says he lost his family and his health ending up 
in a queens hospital with hepatitis from shooting up with a dirty 
needle 
then he found the lord 
born again he won back his family and went off to bible college 
in pensacola fla later moving to corpus christi texas to join 
the ministries of the rev lester roloff an evangelist who ran a 
wellpublicized home for troubled children before his death in a 
1982 plane crash 
fountain felt the call to begin his own ministry and his own 
childrens home and in 1978 he wife carol and seven children 
pulled into lucedale 
his bethel baptist church and childrens home thrived at one 
point as many as 150 children were on campus parents who could 
afford it paid 275 a month plus 750 for materials and 
registration some paid less some paid nothing 
it didnt matter to fountain the lord had called him for this 
work 
the state had tried to shut him down in 1980 and failed six 
years later the welfare department raided the bethesda home for 
girls in hattiesburg run by his friend the rev bob wills and 
wills wife betty sue 
the 113 girls taken from the home spoke of stripsearches 
paddlings and starvation diets onefourth of the girls reported 
missing their menstrual periods for two months to a year the 
result mrs wills forthrightly explained of stress brought on by 
muchneeded discipline 
discipline that was the key to a spiritual life the willses 
believed and fountain agreed wholeheartedly children needed 
discipline it said as much in the bible and his charges knew 
proverbs 2313 by heart 
do not withhold correction from a child 
for if you beat him with a rod he will not die 
you shall beat him with a rod 
and deliver his soul from hell 
that was fountains calling delivering young souls from hell

the rev herman fountain founder of the bethel 
home for children had been accused before of abusing children in 
his care although little was done but this time was different 
state welfare commissioner thomas brittain jr who had become 
increasingly convinced that many bethel kids were being physically 
and emotionally brutalized would not back down the battle lines 
were drawn the first stones would be cast by frightened children

on june 1 patrick took the witness 
stand herman fountain was staring at him 
the story patrick told was one of a child subjected to constant 
ridicule and bullying hardly a day passed of his 18 months at the 
bethel home for children when he was not hit with a switch for some 
offense real or imagined talking without permission slacking off 
on a job looking at a girl all were unpardonable offenses at 
bethel 
the whippings left bruises and raised welts some children later 
testified at patricks hearing that they saw others bleed and 
their clothing would stick to the dried blood 
laps were another common punishment patrick said he would be 
awakened at 4 am an hour before the bethel day began and made 
to run laps around a track twentyfive laps or about 2 miles 
was a typical distance sometimes the run would be timed 45 
seconds a lap those who couldnt keep up the 75 minute per mile 
pace had to run more or received other punishment 
pushups were common even the smallest boys might be told to do 
50 the rose garden was a series of calisthenics pushups 
leg lifts situps children ordered to do a minefield walked 
up and down a football field on their hands and toes 
brother david owens in charge of the girls was known among the 
children for two particular exercises the chair in which a 
child had to assume a sitting position against a wall and another 
where she would stand on tiptoe with her chin against the wall as 
high as she could hold it 
when the children were put to work patrick more often than not 
was in the nigger crew the boys assigned to do the dirtiest 
most strenuous work he might work his way to a good crew but a 
moment of horseplay would send him right back to nigger crew where 
he would be forced to do something even worse than before 
while a backhoe and bulldozer sat idle the crew dug a ditch 
4feetdeep and a halfmile long and patrick was ordered to dig in 
front of the rest where the ground had yet to be broken 
when they started the ditch patrick said later six children 
tried to run away 
some children said they were injured while working or were 
forced to work or run laps while ill some received prompt medical 
attention but others did not a local doctor testified he told 
bethel adults that patrick would lose sight in one eye without 
glasses but they were never ordered 
once other children were told to throw dirt clods at him while 
he was in the ditch sometimes he was subjected to the nigger 
pile on a leaders order other children would hit him knock 
him to the ground and pile on top of him 
sleep was no escape patrick who suffered from a bedwetting 
problem was put on allnight pee watch awakened hourly to 
urinate whether or not he needed to and punished if he refused 
when he wet the bed he was hit again 
daily humiliation and punishment for a problem he couldnt 
control became unbearable and he sought out an older boy scott 
for advice 
i said let the lord handle it scott said later 
scott im tired of waiting around for the lord patrick 
replied im going to do something myself

on june 8 the second day of patricks hearing mark maples the 
county prosecutor called herman fountain to the stand 
it was about time maples felt for fountain to explain himself 
fountain had other ideas the state was meddling this was a church 
matter and it would remain so 
beyond giving his name and address he refused to answer 
questions citing the separation of church and state 
whos in charge at bethel maples asked 
the lord jesus christ fountain replied 
what mortal is in charge at bethel maples tried again 
no mortal is in charge fountain said we are a group of 
reborn christians serving the lord jesus christ and he alone is in 
charge 
questions about the childrens nutrition education punishment 
work and medical needs went unanswered judge robert oswald found 
fountain in contempt of court and ordered him to jail a sentence 
that lasted 30 minutes jail the judge decided was not going to 
compel this man to cooperate 
he could see it in my eyes fountain said later 
later that week oswald found fountain owens and another 
assistant brother tom macdonald in contempt and ordered fines 
totaling 1500 a day until they agreed to cooperate the fines 
would top 100000 but fountain had made his decision 
so had the judge patricks story had convinced him of physical 
abuse medical neglect and unreasonable detention at the very 
least the other children would be removed from bethel and he 
would hear their stories too

arrangements were made to take the children by bus to the 
mississippi state hospital at whitfield a mental institution with 
enough security and vacant dormitories to house them temporarily 
back at bethel fountain gathered the children in the church 
youre going to a nuthouse he told them i have no more 
control over you 
within minutes the serene campus was in an uproar as welfare 
workers and buses stood by some children scurried for the trees 
police on their heels state troopers and sheriffs deputies spent 
hours picking up others found wandering along the streets or hiding 
in private homes 
other children went willingly 
in a way i felt good 12yearold joshua said of the chance 
to leave bethel in a way i felt bad because there were some 
kids who did not have homes didnt have nowhere to go some kids 
didnt know what to do 
that was their home

many of the children of bethel are human 
throwaways tossed out by parents who no longer want to deal with 
them or no longer know how 
some of the kids have no parents others simply feel as if they 
dont 
i would phone said 12yearold joshua clutching his 
redleather bible but they wouldnt accept my calls 
the children whose names have been changed to meet mississippi 
law about juveniles identities came from across the nation with 
the majority from texas florida arizona and washington some had 
physical or mental disabilities such as hyperactivity or downs 
syndrome some had emotional problems drug or alcohol habits or 
had been in trouble with the police 
others were typical teenagers experiencing the upheaval of 
adolescence and all the confusion and rebellion that comes with 
growing up 
scott adopted at age 7 by people who later changed their minds 
bounced in and out of foster homes for years his last family sent 
him to bethel two years ago my parents had written me after i 
was there for a while and said the reason i was there was because 
they didnt have the facilities to handle me and take care of me 
they wanted someone who would take the responsibility on them 
of bringing me up right my parents never really wanted me 
freed from bethel by the state scott earned his ged equivalency 
certificate because the bethel school is unaccredited its 
diplomas are not recognized by any state and applied for 
cosmetology school he began dating stephanie another former 
bethel resident and they plan to marry someday and raise a family 
both say bethel taught them how not to treat children 
im not going to have my kid switched every second he acts 
up scott said im going to make sure i can deal with it 
id try to work out any problems with my child said 
15yearold stephanie who wants to be a teacher if that didnt 
work id keep on trying id never give up id never send them to 
a place like bethel 
scott and stephanie are in counseling now as are all the bethel 
children in state custody months and months of being told that the 
outside world is satans playground that saying thinking doing 
or feeling certain things will send them straight to hell has left 
many confused and fearful 
but for others bethel is salvation outsiders dont understand 
what they were what theyve become and what they went through 
along the way one after the other they will say they deserved the 
whippings they used to get but they dont deserve the bad rap 
theyre getting now 
these are fountains success stories followers like sophia who 
call the pastor daddy arriving at bethel in 1985 was like 
landing on another planet for the rebellious 16yearold street 
veteran from boca raton fla a drug abuser and runaway who 
frequented every taverns ladies night in town 
i thought these people were crazy she recalled i got 
smart to brother fountain and he said im going to bust your 
bottom he showed me a switch i thought a twig whats that 
going to do 
she soon found out back talk to the dorm leader ended in a 
brawl broken up by brother owens and his switch 
he smacked me around sophia said its the first spanking 
i ever got and whoa i knew they meant business i was cussing up 
a storm 
the head leader slapped sophias face and when brother fountain 
came back he slapped her too 
i said go ahead and kill me everything had been drained 
out of me she said all that rebellion that i had built up for 
16 years of my life was gone the devil really was beat out of me 
she spent a week in the revival room a small windowless room 
used to isolate disruptive children where two girls pointed out 
the error of her ways they talked to me and they helped me and 
they showed me the lord and i got saved 
her eyes opened she realized she had finally come home 
you can say do good do good but they lived it theyre 
really happy sophia said and she started to cry i came here 
and they showed me something like a reason to live a purpose in 
life 
now 20 and married dandling her baby boy on her lap sophia 
believes she has found the happiness she craved 
i love this home she said resolutely i cant believe 
what all these ignorant people are doing saying im brainwashed 
if im brainwashed i think everybody needs to be

fridays raid at the bethel home for 
children was followed by mondays last stand 
over the weekend word reached judge robert oswald that some of 
the children who had fled police had returned to bethel he ordered 
authorities back to the church to retrieve any children they could 
find 
bethel founder herman fountain in youth court awaiting further 
hearing testimony caught wind of the action and ordered his staff 
to ignore the subpoenas that had summoned them and return to 
bethel there would be no compromise on this day 
fountain locked the church doors barricading three dozen 
parents and children in the church they had built by hand dozens 
of state troopers and sheriffs deputies stood by for more than 
three hours while welfare commissioner thomas brittain jr tried 
to negotiate the childrens release 
police finally broke in and took the children while church 
members recited bible verse and sang hymns 
if god be for us who can be against us read the bethel sign 
by the road 
fountain his eldest son herman jr nicknamed bubba and 
brother david owens were among eight people arrested that day 
fountain faces three counts of felonious assault on a police 
officer and one count of inciting a riot all scheduled to be 
presented to the grand jury later this month 
troubles seemed to overrun the pastor like the locusts of 
pharaohs egypt a former bethel resident rhonnda traxler 
gathered reporters outside the courthouse and alleged fountain 
sexually molested her and another girl while they were at bethel 
fountain denied the accusation and leveled his own you cant 
believe this girl theres no telling how many men shes been 
with 
another former bethel child ray friery filed a 1 million 
federal lawsuit against fountain alleging assault and battery 
abuse neglect and false imprisonment 
fountain wasnt the only one with problems many state workers 
involved in the case received harassing phone calls or believed 
they were being followed by bethel supporters 
brittain sent his 13yearold daughter out of state after 
anonymous callers threatened to kidnap her and put her in a church 
home where she would never be found again 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
before the youth court hearings ended about half of the more 
than 70 children taken from bethel had testified some were too 
frightened to appear 
theyre really wicked little kids fountain said in a later 
interview with the associated press im talking about 
homosexuals im talking about lesbians im talking about 
prostitutes im talking about one boy who raped his 84yearold 
grandmother im talking about one who murdered his sister 
im talking habitual runaways im talking car thieves im 
talking nymphomaniacs 
brittain dealt with the same youngsters but saw something 
different 
for the most part theyre pretty normal kids who have been 
battered around by life pretty badly the welfare commissioner 
said theyre children trying to put their lives back together 
some parents had despaired of getting help from state agencies 
for them bethel was a last resort for others it was a matter of 
convenience one child was sent to bethel because he took food 
from the refrigerator brittain said 
but as the hearing continued after the raid on bethel some 
parents sat in the courtroom and wept overwhelmed by stories of 
hairpulling faceslapping laprunning and switchings a 
13yearold girl with downs syndrome said she ran laps all day 
long received frequent spankings and sometimes stood for hours on 
tiptoe with her chin above a light switch 
they said she was a little brat and had a demon in her 
another girl said parents agreed with it they said thats what 
you deserve if youve acted in a wrong way 
some parents said they were misled they didnt know what bethel 
really was other parents knew exactly what bethel was 
when i went down there i was totally convinced what had 
occurred was not morally right legally right or anyway right 
said jack hicks of birdsboro pa but his two teenage sons support 
fountain and they changed his mind

they love the man tremendously if my children said to me 
dad thats not the way it was they were cruel and abused us 
id be after brother fountain he said but theyve solidified 
my support 
about 50 of the children were released to their parents who 
signed a court agreement not to return them to bethel without the 
judges approval protecting the children this way was about all 
the state and judge oswald could do since bethel is a private 
unregulated facility 
now a dozen parents including hicks are preparing a lawsuit 
against the state for its action at bethel 
i look at this much beyond just an incident that occurred in 
the state of mississippi hicks said lets term it religious 
harassment 
 
life is slow at bethel these days with so few children around 
the home remains open but rows of girls bunk beds stand empty 
except for the stuffed bears and rabbits left behind by former 
occupants 
a few new children have come since the hearings a few former 
residents have returned 
no winner has emerged from the emotional battle over bethel 
which begins and ends with a collision of convictions 
brittain and his team of investigators oswald and prosecutor 
mark maples consider it a matter of child protection 
herman fountain his faithful flock and other fundamentalists 
who came to lend support have called it an issue of religious 
freedom 
conservative religious belief courses through mississippis 
veins and beats fiercely in its heart the perception that the 
state is venturing into the realm of the church makes blood run 
hot but so does the perception that church home operators are 
using fundamental religion and the bible as justification to abuse 
and neglect children 
im a christian theyre supposed to be christians said 
welfare investigator kathy prine who teaches sunday school at her 
baptist church i believe this is wrong these kids are being 
physically abused these people claim the kids are liars and are 
not being abused but are being raised by what the bible says 
it makes you question your faith and your job when we went in 
there i asked someone am i hurting the church am i hurting 
gods work by doing this i thought about it and i said no no 
im not 
oswald in his order removing the children from bethel wrote 
if there is a conflict of interests between religion and the 
protection of children this courts decision must be to protect 
first the children 
fountain sees it another way i dealt with oswald in 
chambers about his soul he says the laws of the land are first 
and that the bibles second fountain said i said thats 
wrong that bibles first and the law of the land is second 
mississippi along with north carolina south carolina 
louisiana missouri and florida has no law licensing churchrun 
boarding homes although some voluntarily apply for licenses 
as a result there is no way to reach many of the children in 
such homes many of whom are denied communication with the outside 
for months at a time or to ensure that basic educational 
sanitation and safety standards are met 
weve had to wait years to collect information in bits and 
pieces from runaway children brittain said we have no way of 
knowing whats going on inside those four walls 
maples has filed a court petition to force bethel to comply with 
state laws governing education safety standards and child labor 
laws the court has yet to act on it if enforced such an order 
could close bethel because fountain has said he would never 
cooperate 
for the two years he has been welfare commissioner brittain has 
pushed for a law to open the doors of homes like bethel fountain 
has prayed against one 
this might well be the year that the power of prayer is overcome 
by the power of politics observers agree that outrage over 
conditions at bethel has been so great that the legislature might 
be forced to act 
even fountain agrees saying it would take an act of god to 
prevent a licensure law from emerging in the next legislative 
session 
at bethel they will be praying round the clock 
theyre going against god and thats their problem thats 
why were going to win fountain said the gates of hell aint 
going to prevail against our church

dukakis was a crosscountry track star captain of the tennis 
team and at only 5foot8 a guard on the basketball team 
emulating the backcourt hustle of rookie bob cousy his idol on the 
boston celtics he played first trumpet in the band suffering 
chapped lips in the thanksgiving day football classic with ancient 
rival newton 
oikonomia economy as preached by his father dictated 
chores after school and odd jobs like working as a garbage 
collector on summer vacations 
sandy doesnt recall his being particularly penurious but 
none of us had much back then a heavy date was an ice cream soda 
at hojos we went to lots of red sox games he was a rabid fan 
and i presume in those days the boy always bought the tickets 
fibbing about his age l7yearold dukakis entered the 26mile 
boston marathon practically the whole senior class turned out to 
cheer him up heartbreak hill and beg cups of water from the 
drugstores along beacon street as he finished a respectable 57th 
as recorded in murivian brooklines yearbook dukakis was 
elected president and pledged allegiance to the ideals of the 
honorary society alpha pi 
big chief brain in the face as the book dubbed him was too 
busy that frantic senior year to notice kitty dickson a pretty 
freshman and already outspoken feminist who a dozen years later 
would be introduced to her future husband and now presidential 
candidate by her best friend sandy bakalar 
running as if chased by republicans as the phoenix the 
college weekly noted marathon man michael continued to excel in 
crosscountry at swarthmore where even the football team sometimes 
experienced the loneliness of the longdistance runner letters to 
the phoenix regularly complained that alumni outnumbered students 
in the wooden bleachers that still resemble a little league field 
sports were definitely smalltime at swarthmore where home runs 
landed in the astronomy professor peter van de kamps rose garden 
only the chess team went undefeated in the dukakis years but the 
football team finally had a winning season 43 in his senior 
year the garnets also called the little quakers managed to suit 
up some outstanding athletes dick hall two years ahead went 
directly from the campus to the pittsburgh pirates outfield tight 
end charles chuck cooper michaels junior year roommate 
turned down a contract with the los angeles rams and went on to 
become an economic adviser to several occupants of the white house 
founded by the society of friends in 1864 swarthmore had long 
since dropped its denominational ties but the quaker ideals of 
tolerance high standards of personal conduct and dedication to 
world peace and disarmament still wafted across campus like a 
benign breeze 
pennsylvania military adademy was kindly requested not to fire 
its touchdown cannon at football games on thursday mornings the 
entire student body gathered in clothier memorial for 
collection an assembly dedicated to moral or cultural uplift 
by friendly persuasion 
in world war i an army training unit was permitted on campus 
but the cadets paraded without rifles british poet wh auden 
taught composition to a navy v12 unit in world war ii when the 
campus was a meld of ocs and cos cadet officers and 
conscientious objectors after much agonizing the administration 
rejected an rotc unit during the korean war 
two months after arriving on campus dukakis on nov 3 l951 
celebrated his 18th birthday by registering for the draft there 
were recurrent reminders in the phoenix from gen lewis blaine 
hershey that students were not exempt but deferred from the draft 
if they maintained a caverage 
an army recruiter took pains one day to explain that in an 
infantry division of 20000 men only 3000 carried rifles while 
the great majority were occupied in noncombat units his remarks 
concluded to polite applause and the release of a dove 
many were critical of our involvement in the war dean stott 
remembers but the college made it clear this was a moral 
obligation 
actually fraternities were a bigger issue on campus in the 
early 50s swarthmore was and is a dry town and the five frat 
houses offered beer along with brotherhood 
a wild friday night party might go on until 1230 says 
leigh whitaker who like preston belonged to delta upsilon when 
their wharton dorm mate dukakis signed a letter in the phoenix 
telling freshmen they didnt need to join a fraternity to have a 
good time at swarthmore 
his main objection was a clause in some national charters 
discriminating against jews and blacks when a campus poll favored 
retaining fraternities two of which still survive dukakis served 
on a bipartisan committee that recommended severing ties with 
national fraternities that discriminated

as congressional antisubversive investigators began questioning 
professors at nearby temple university young dukakis joined and 
soon became campus president of students for democratic action he 
lobbied rural lawmakers to oppose a loyalty oath bill in the 
pennsylvania assembly and according to victor navasky now editor 
of the nation magazine talked one out of every four schoolmates 
into joining the american civil liberties union 
sen joseph mccarthys excesses had a great deal to do with my 
seriously thinking about entering politics dukakis recently 
recalled 
in the election year of 1952 he was president of students for 
stevenson who by a healthy margin became the first democrat to win 
the campus straw vote although republicans were thin on the 
ground to test the dukakis debating skills preston recalls a 
bull session on the third floor of wharton when someone mentioned 
that michael had it in him to go all the way meaning the white 
house 
ted also remembers the spring of their junior year when 
murmurs of real excitement ran through the dining hall as jojo 
black spread the word that her father justice hugo black had just 
telephoned news of the supreme court decision outlawing school 
segregation at swarthmore that was bigger than a world series 
result 
swarthmores liberalism rankled many of the neighbors in the 
rest of delaware county where republicans outnumbered democrats 8 
to l 
dukakis recently recalled for an alumni group in boston how the 
conductor on the west chester local always sang out as the train 
approached the station before swarthmore morton the stop before 
moscow 
his admission to the honors program which swarthmore pioneered 
put him in the top eschelon of a remarkably brainy student body 
his campus contemporaries included howard tenin a quiet member of 
the wrestling team who would win a nobel prize in medicine carl 
levin the future us senator from michigan rhodes scholar frank 
sieverts budding novelist hugh nissenson and future physicians jon 
fine and richard burtis his hitchhiking buddy on summer vacations 
but the undergrad going wasnt all grind there were midnight 
sled rides down parrish hill on cafeteria trays freshman 
serenade a fall fertility rite erupted into a panty raid his 
first year the girls on the top floor of parrish hall defended 
their lingerie by dumping wastebaskets of water on the male 
marauders and inserting toilet plungers into the handles of the 
dorms double doors 
dean of men everett hunt appeared out of the shadows to restore 
order and was promptly deluged with a tub of sudsy laundry water 
proves the campus isnt completely lifeless he sputtered 
philosophically taking to his bed with a bad case of chills 
next term the poenix reported two gentlemen adventurers were 
suspended for a week for scaling the college water tower and 
engraving thereon fraternal greek letters 
then there was the outrageous adlai hoax that brought reporters 
and photographers swarming to the campus from the philadelphia 
dailies at the beginning of the 1953 spring term swarthmore was 
seeking a replacement for president john nason who was leaving to 
head the foreign policy association frank irish who ran with 
dukakis on the crosscountry team raced through the night to the 
firm that printed the phoenix and substituted a bogus front page 
that proclaimed in tabloidsized headlines adlai prexy 
the story spuriously quoted outgoing president nason if our 
students thought mr stevenson would make a good president for the 
country then he ought to be good enough for our college 
the administration was aghast and embarrassed but stevenson on 
vacation in the caribbean was amused and cabled his hope that the 
college will not deal harshly with my beloved and youthful 
friends 
elected to phi betta kappa as well as president of the student 
council dukakis was one of five in a class of 210 to graduate with 
highest honors he might have been and should have been president 
of his graduating class the yearbook shows him seated with 
officers of the class of 55 but shortly after it went to press 
swarthmore with characteristic egalitarianism voted to abolish 
all class officers 
now another michael is the focus of attention at swarthmore 
mikhail chkhenkeli from tblisi in soviet georgia is among the 
first of a glasnost coterie of soviet students arriving at american 
colleges 
mikhail fulfills a cultural exchange first proposed by the 
student council when michael dukakis was its president

the weekly reader the little newspaper read 
by generations of american school children celebrates its 60th 
birthday this fall still going strong with 9 million readers it 
will mark the occasion with 60 years of news for kids a book 
of stories from past editions and aimed at the twothirds of 
american adults who grew up reading it 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the modest periodical first hit grade school 
desks in 1928 poor boys who made good are now running for the 
highest office in the world read the headline over stories about 
herbert hoover and alfred smith 
so much for news inside were stories about dandelions and 
sunshine a few rudimentary drawings and a poem extolling the 
curative powers of cod liver oil 
it was an inauspicious beginning for what has proven a classroom 
institution weekly reader the little newspaper read by 
generations of american school children celebrates its 60th 
birthday this fall still going strong with 9 million readers who 
pay an average of 225 a year to subscribe 
it will mark the occasion with 60 years of news for kids a 
book made up of stories from past editions and aimed at a 
potentially vast audience the twothirds of american adults who 
grew up with weekly reader eight editions are published for 
the different grade levels 
among them is current editorinchief terry borton whose own 
weekly reader years coincided with the end of world war ii when 
subscribers were encouraged to save resources and buy war bonds 
i remember a sense of being mobilized by the school and by 
weekly reader borton says 
judging from its promotional materials pharos books the 
publisher of 60 years of news for kids hopes to generate a 
tidal wave of nostalgia remember blackboards and chalk dust 
schoolyards and recess fridays and weekly reader 
in some instances the book may indeed more accurately reflect 
chalk dust than history especially in its early years weekly 
reader found much of the news unfit for its pages it declined to 
cover the crash of 1929 the great depression was played down and 
the holocaust was ignored altogether 
we promise to do our share in guarding americas children 
from the hazards of fear tensions and frustration and to 
contribute to emotional stability through the inspiration and 
reassurances which the carefully selected current content of my 
weekly reader brings to children founder eleanor johnson 
reassured teachers in 1942 ours shall be a positive philosophy 
of optimism 
accordingly weekly reader made valiant attempts to put a 
happy face on world war ii young readers were told that 
thousands of american men are learning to cook and sew in the 
army and that nifty wartime inventions such as butter that wont 
spoil cake flavoring from a tablet dishes that bounce but dont 
break when dropped would soon be available for civilian use 
closer to the news were stories about an imaginary curtain that 
divided germany into two parts a bitter fight between arabs and 
jews over palestine india celebrating its independence from great 
britain 
weekly reader also devoted a fair amount of space to news of 
inventions innovations and pop culture 
when the fairy godmother turned the pumpkin into a coach she 
used magic a 1946 feature began nowadays there is a new kind 
of magic this magic is called plastics 
another magical invention announced in 1949 a camera that could 
make pictures in one minute 
the 50s brought slightly harderedged stories about the korean 
war the suez canal sputnik a 1954 story gave background on a war 
being fought in vietnam laos and cambodia a 1957 piece focused on 
plans by six european nations to establish a common market 
the newspaper also filled its pages with breathless accounts of 
postwar progress of supermarkets and superhighways convenience 
foods and jet airplanes polio vaccines and nuclear power 
readers were reminded in 1951 that people making the first 
longdistance phone calls will have to keep one eye on their 
watches for the first time there will be no operator to say 
sorry your time is up 
two years later weekly reader reassured kids that tv colors 
are beginning to look more real strawberry ice cream in tv ads 
looks so good that you can almost taste it 
the year 1953 also brought important news from the soviet union 
stalin was dead replaced by georgi malenkov of whom weekly 
reader had this to say his pictures show him to be a short 
fat man malenkov spends most of his time at his office he does 
not like to go to parties or talk with strangers 
the year 1958 brought a rare product endorsement hula hoops 
are made of plastic they are a good kind of toy whirling hoops is 
good exercise for children

a special memorial issue followed the assassination of john f 
kennedy other 1960s stories touched on the summer riots of 68 
the six day war and the first moon landing 
weekly reader covered the war on poverty but shied away from 
the war in vietnam not everyone goes along with the presidents 
plans in vietnam a 1968 story said for the most part weekly 
reader let it go at that 
there was a lot of concern about the degree of disagreement 
over the war borton says people were uncertain about how to 
handle that as a result the vietnamese war was barely touched on 
by the paper 
drugs watergate consumerism the energy crisis world hunger 
the exodus from city to suburb and the revolution in iran all made 
headlines in the 70s feature stories told of a new hit tv show 
called sesame street 1970 a soviet gymnast named olga korbut 
1973 and a new choking rescue method invented by dr henry 
heimlich 1976 
like many newspapers weekly reader has refined its use of 
graphics in the 80s this years editions have a decidedly more 
contemporary look with color photos in all eight editions 
weekly reader now routinely reports on such topics as drug 
abuse apartheid and the arms race especially in editions aimed at 
older children 
stories with a strong sexual content are avoided borton 
says while such topics as teen pregnancy are still offlimits 
however a 1987 story for sixthgraders on the life of aids victim 
ryan white pulled no punches today ryan weighs barely 60 
pounds he holds his cold blue hands over the redhot coils of 
the kitchen stove ryan never seems to get warm anymore 
the newspaper covered the attempted assassination of ronald 
reagan the challenger disaster famine in africa and racial 
conflict in america other recent stories have focused on missing 
children and homelessness the irancontra affair and the strategic 
defense initiative 
we dont skirt problems says borton we try to inform 
them about whats happening but we also try to talk about what 
people are doing to solve problems if its a problem thats being 
presented 
the paper which has changed hands several times was acquired 
in 1985 by its current owner field publications the nations 
largest marketer of childrens book clubs 
unlike at most newspapers the middletown connbased editorial 
staff of 15 teachers and journalists and a halfdozen artists spend 
most of their time at the office rather than in the field stories 
are culled from other newspapers and magazines although we do 
try to develop a childs angle borton says 
occasionally weekly reader generates news of its own a 
1983 survey of its readers found that 31 percent of fourthgrade 
subscribers felt pressured to smoke marijuana the finding prompted 
changes in federal drug abuse prevention strategy which has since 
been modified to include younger kids 
the news weeklys current circulation of 9 million is up from 6 
million in 1977 its lowest ebb which came during a drop in school 
enrollments also coincided with the only major format change in 
the papers history 
the paper shifted away from its formula of news and skills in 
an attempt to appeal more to kids there was more childrens 
interest and the news became more featury borton says it 
didnt work 
entertaining children was not what eleanor johnson had in mind 
when she conceived the notion of a newspaper written expressly for 
grade school children miss johnson editorinchief for 26 years 
and a consultant for 17 more died a year ago at age 94 
as a young school administrator in york pa miss johnson had 
been bothered by a lack of emphasis on current events in the 
classroom i saw that children were being given a lot of myths 
and folklore to read but were utterly illiterate about what was 
happening in the world she once said to live in this world 
newspaper reading is indispensable 
the first issue appeared on sept 21 1928 and cost about a 
penny other than the price weekly reader hasnt really 
changed all that much its still guided by its original aim to 
present selected wellwritten news of interest and value to 
children with accuracy and fairness colorful but uncolored 
borton thinks its survived because its a lot cheaper than a 
newspaper and every child can have one its small and easy to 
handle and most importantly of all its written for kids 
the new york times assumes you understand a great deal about 
the world we assume kids in sixth grade understand what kids in 
sixth grade understand

he has written 50 books a thousand newspaper 
articles and once had his own wire service but mostly joseph kane 
is a collector of facts about who was the first to do this or that 
a debunker of erroneous history its been his calling for most of 
his 89 years 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
joseph nathan kane tells a visitor to come to 
the 27th floor of an upper west side building that has only 25 
floors he promises a 5 million view with 5 worth of furniture 
joe kane will also tell you that the declaration of independence 
was not signed on july 4 1776 that george washington was not the 
first president that elias howe did not invent the sewing machine 
and that charles edgar duryea really manufactured the first 
automobile regularly made for sale 
the 89yearold exnewspaperman and author is serious kane is 
not just the author but the entire staff of one of the most 
unusual and most enduring reference books in the world famous 
first facts a record of first happenings discoveries and 
inventions in the united states as its first edition was called 
when it was published in 1933 
kane is now working on the fifth edition the fourth came out 
in 1981 as well as four other books he hopes to publish within a 
year or two 
everything emanates out of this unusual apartment that has more 
paper 3by5 index cards reference books and book cases than 
places to sit down except for a few plants and the dr pepper he 
keeps in the halfrefrigerator not much in this oddly shaped 
oblong room seems to have been purchased in the last halfcentury 
make that century 
kane sole inhabitant of this garret for more than 25 years is 
not a man who exaggerates the view from what passes as a kitchen 
is worth 5 million stretching up the hudson river beyond the 
george washington bridge down to the world trade center and 
beyond across into new jersey 
so what if you have to walk up the last two flights because the 
elevator stops on 25 
kane is author of more than 50 books some of which he churned 
out to pay the rent such as a forgettable volume called what dog 
is that describing various breeds of dogs he also has sold more 
than 1000 newspaper articles he once had his own news service and 
was an accredited white house correspondent 
he has been called a historian a detective of facts and a 
deglorifier of american history 
history he proclaims is a glorification of fairy tales 
there isnt a thing you know that is correct but still it is 
better to know something that is wrong than not to know anything 
it is better for instance to think that george washington was 
the first president than not to have any idea the truth is 
washington was the first president elected under the constitution 
but thomas mckean of delaware was the first president of the united 
states in congress assembled under the articles of confederation in 
1781 eight years before washington took office 
it is also good to know the importance of july 4 1776 but the 
accurate version according to kane is that the declaration of 
independence was first ordered to be fairly engrossed on 
parchment on july 19 1776 and was signed in philadelphia on 
aug 2 by 50 members of the original 56 who voted for its adoption 
the other six signed at later times the last being thomas mckean 
who was permitted to sign as late as 1781 due to serving in the 
army away from philadelphia 
over 50 people have told me their father invented the 
automobile for example he says when i start verifying 
claims i find that someones father may have invented the fourth 
knob on the fifth spark plug on the sixth day at 7 oclock says 
kane but he didnt invent the automobile 
it was charles edgar duryea who opened the duryea motor wagon 
company in springfield mass in 1895 he began building his 
automobile in 1891 and first successfully operated it on april 19 
1892 
kane publishes only those facts that can be verified by patent 
offices official records in the library of congress or other 
original data 
im stupid enough not to believe anything until i see the 
proof he says 
kane wrote his first book in 1929 it wasnt until four years 
later rejected by 11 publishers that he sold the idea to the hw 
wilson co with a little help from librarians he met as he 
crisscrossed the united states on an 11month tour he showed them 
the local facts which they knew to be correct and then beseeched 
them to write to the californiabased company and say they would 
love to have such a tome in their reference rooms

it wasnt easy work 
ive got stuff in that book maybe five or six lines that 
has taken me 30 to 40 years to verify 
kane has mellowed with the years he still gives lectures 
rambles he calls them and manages to irritate the crowd by 
debunking truths learned in grade school 
but hes softer now 
i used to be a wise guy i would write letters correcting 
people i once corrected someone on a number of facts in a 
presentation and i embarrassed him and broke his heart and after 
all what difference does it really make 
kane says he gets three or four calls from the white house each 
year asking him a question for the white house hell answer but 
he makes sure he knows the number and tells the aide he will call 
back if the aide gives the right number then joe kane stays on 
the line and answers the question 
when industry calls and asks if he can find some first for them 
he explains it will cost 35000 and he wont guarantee hell find 
the answer budget planners dont hop on that kind of honesty 
a lot of what i have in the book is there by serendipity its 
not something i set out to look up you cant look up half of these 
things you just come across them as you go along 
kane plays a 50yearold record for a visitor memorabilia from 
kanes career as a writer for the early quiz shows he wrote all 
the questions for break the bank a network radio show that 
began in 1945 and finally finished up on television in the 50s 
kane also supplied some questions for the 64000 question and 
double or nothing and had just written a book on how to win on 
quiz shows when scandal rocked the industry and the book lost its 
chance to become a big seller 
in a safe deposit box kane has a number of other treasures 
including the first fountain pen a shoe with a revolving heel to 
account for wear and the first safety pin with the patent number 
still on it that number for trivia buffs is 24517 
his newspaper articles are stored in metal boxes over a century 
old that the new york central used to keep its records in 
kane is an expert on presidents and is working on the fifth 
edition of facts about the presidents 
kane is a slightly shrunken 5feet8 with white hair a neatly 
trimmed white beard a fairly brisk gait and general good health 
despite a slight hearing loss he says his parents lived well into 
their 90s and he intends to do at least as well 
ive made a rather faustian pact with the devil he 
deadpans ill be ready to go two days after i finish my last 
project but you see ive left myself quite an open back door 
kane and a lady friend spend two weeks every year at a mexican 
spa where he relaxes eats a vegetarian diet and boasts about the 
fact that the ceilings are dusted twice a day with feather dusters 
that compensates for the scorpions noted on the floor 
kane sees his tilting at the windmills of history as really a 
fight for the underdog the truly creative man or woman who never 
made the history books because someone else had better public 
relations skills 
his favorite inventor and personal hero is william hunt an 
inventor who died in 1859 it was he says kane who invented the 
sewing machine 12 years before howe kane sees most of the true 
inventors as pathetic figures and hunt outclasses them all 
his voice picks up even more life as he talks about hunt 
ive only given him half the credit to which he is entitled 
but when you read it you will cry he had such a tough life 
everybody said he was crazy but he wasnt 
hunts story exemplifies one of nathans favorite sayings one 
he has on a placard the person with a new idea is a crackpot 
until it succeeds 
the story will bring no one any money but i think it will be 
the most interesting biography you will ever read 
or adds the man who refuses ever to take himself too 
seriously it will sell six copies

garlic drink vinegary red wine and anisette coffee and share a 
heritage that has baffled scholars for centuries 
about 75000 to 100000 americans have basque blood although 
they are commonly referred to as basques they call themselves 
eskualdunak and eskualherria is the term for their native land 
most live in the west blending into elko and mountain home 
bakersfield and winnemucca where they live as solid citizens and 
patriots they take great pride in claiming basque sailors helped 
discover the new world 
about 20 of christopher columbus crewmen were bizcainos or 
basque people says dr pat bieter a professor at boise state 
university in idaho and an expert on basque migration 
south american hero simon bolivar and ferdinand magellans first 
mate juan sebastian del cano were also basques others came to 
california from mexico with spanish explorers in the 1600s and 
1700s 
the real influx didnt begin until the middle of the last 
century with the gold rush bieter says a move by disgruntled 
california lawmakers to tax noncitizen miners prompted the basques 
to turn to agriculture in the rich central valley 
still tucked away in some slowtochange western neighborhoods 
usually near a railroad station where passenger trains dont stop 
anymore are a few basque boarding houses a century ago they were 
filled with many young shepherds fresh off the boat trying to get 
a start in a strange new country 
each american basque family is only one or two generations 
removed from a patriarch who crossed america by train with only a 
few coins in his pocket and a sign around his neck stating his 
destination in english so the conductor could tell him where to get 
off brothers followed brothers cousins trailed cousins to the 
vast sheep range of the great basin where basques took their wages 
in old ewes and began building their own herds one animal at a time 
from those fledgling flocks many basques went on to acquire big 
ranches and in some cases great wealth accumulated by frugal 
living many native basque women also came alone to america to work 
in boarding houses and restaurants and marry the transplanted 
shepherds 
two stereotypes of american basques obscure their true 
collective character today 
one is a lingering romantic notion both in their european 
homeland on the iberian peninsula and in this country that has 
been fostered by books and movies it portrays them as tranquil 
farmers tending herds and flocks drinking copious amounts of wine 
from their leather pouches and singing sad songs 
voltaire described them as the people who dwell or rather who 
dance at the foot of the pyrenees 
we passed lots of basques with oxen or cattle hauling carts 
along the road and nice farmhouses low roofs and all 
whiteplastered wrote ernest hemingway in the sun also 
rises in the basque country the land all looks very rich and 
green and the houses and villages look welloff and clean 
bieter estimates that today as few as 10 percent of american 
basques are in the sheep business the main reason their parents 
and grandparents came to this country basques now are found at all 
economic educational and social levels and include former 
republican sen paul laxalt of nevada and idahos secretary of 
state pete cenarrusa 
the other stereotype of basques stems from their nationalist 
movement in their homeland carried forward by eta a 
violenceprone guerrilla group fighting for an independent basque 
nation for its 32 million people in an area about the size of 
maine 
just as american jews feel they have two homelands one here 
and one in israel so many american basques feel something like 
that says bieter an irishman whose wife eloise is a 
firstgeneration american of basque parents support for the 
separatist group eta among american basques is minimal but it is 
there that is why the north american basque organization nabo 
has prohibited any political discussion or activity within its 
group it is too divisive to allow it 
basques are united by distinct physical characteristics 
including a large incidence of type o blood with a high rh negative 
factor and a low proportion of type b blood all basques consider 
themselves noble because they were knighted as a nation for 
services at the ancient battle of las navas de tolosa 
because american basques are so scattered in their adopted land 
they try hard to hold on to traditions which link them as an ethnic 
entity nabo was founded in 1974 to promote basque culture and help 
keep the language alive twenty local basque clubs have been 
organized in five states the district of columbia and canada they 
range from the opulent san francisco complex that employs a native 
basque chef to a small group of sheepherders that meets to play 
cards and dance in buffalo wyo

but longtime neighbors and nonbasque spouses believe it is 
their zest for hard work and their scrupulous honesty that sets 
them apart 
work has always been the way to recognition the most 
important element in basque culture bieter says next comes 
family loyalty to relatives all the way past third cousins and 
then there is honesty if youre caught being dishonest or lazy 
your reputation is gone much of the basque culture is based on 
integrity 
american basques like their european relatives who run with the 
bulls at the festival of san fermin at pamplona also love parties 
every summer nabo sponsors a festival of traditional singing and 
dancing feasting and a special basque roman catholic mass the 
twoday celebration is like a giant family reunion where basques 
renew friendships throw off the cares of a modern mostly urban 
life and show off their cooking shepherding and musical talents 
this year the festival attracted about 4000 people to buffalo 
doubling its population and helping local ranchers take their minds 
off too much summer heat and no rain 
simon iberlin the local chairman who organized the event is a 
retired sheepman with his black deepset eyes high cheekbones 
olive skin and strong torso iberlin looks 10 years younger than 
his 66 years he spent the festival hobbling on crutches because 
hed just broken his pelvis in an argument with a stubborn horse 
who wanted to throw me off i refused to go 
like most basques iberlin takes a strange sort of pride in the 
mystery of basque origins 
it gives me a chance to come up with all kinds of theories 
about where we came from he says with a grin some people 
think we come from the lost city of atlantis others say we were 
the first to be christianized perhaps we came from the caspian sea 
area in southern russia its my theory that we are related to the 
irish we have the same traits and customs our farming practices 
are identical and we have the same black moods 
basques will tell you their ancestors can be traced back to the 
middle paleolithic age of about 70000 years ago and lived in the 
pyrenees thousands of years before modern europeans arrived 
iberlin like many older basques whose parents were immigrants 
learned to speak the native language before english 
called eskuara the basque language is considered 
autochthonous original and isolated from any other verbal 
communication on earth legends claim it was spoken by adam and 
eve and that one of the adamicspeaking sons of noah settled in 
the mountains before the confusion of tongues at the tower of 
babel basques like to claim the devil himself tried to learn it 
but after eavesdropping seven years behind a door he gave up 
knowing only the word bai meaning yes perhaps say the 
storytellers he even lost his teeth in the ordeal 
the rev jeanpierre etcheverry is a catholic priest from europe 
who is serving three years as cleric to americas basques based in 
san francisco he drives thousands of miles to officiate at 
weddings funerals and festivals throughout the west he was an 
honored guest in buffalo 
the basque community asked the church for its own priest and 
the first one came over from europe in 1960 etcheverry says in 
heavily accented english i am the sixth priest to come at first 
it was very hard because i had no english and there were such long 
travels i try to serve 4000 basque families scattered all over 
the place but now i love it it is a wonderful job the people are 
so wonderful i am truly blessed 
throughout the festival the smoky air was rich with the scent 
of sizzling sausage and lamb burgers cooking on grills some food 
booths offered strong cheeses and course dense basque bread for 
sale other stalls sold wool blankets and crafts photographs of 
sheep and shepherds and basque souvenirs imported from europe 
the festivals first day was highlighted by a main street parade 
of antique sheep wagons 
nearly every wagon had been the canvascovered 11by6foot 
first home of an immigrant basque couple many wagons were hauled 
down from the nearby big horn mountains where they are still used 
every summer as a shepherds home while tending flocks 
the last day of the gathering was devoted to god in the morning 
and dogs in the afternoon an outdoor mass in a log band shell the 
altar decorated with whiskey barrels overflowing with petunias was 
partly conducted in basque a brass band its members dressed in 
red white and green costumes trumpeted fanfares to herald 
highlights next came a picnic and a sheepherding contest to choose 
the best work dog 
dollie iberlin in her book the basque web wrote of her 
husband simons and his peoples heritage 
god was there every sunday and always the sheep the sheep 
the yearly cycles of shearing lambing docking trailing shipping 
and breeding of sheep structured their lives money came in only 
twice a year but love laughter and practical duties filled their 
lives their heritage left to their children is impressive

a diamond the largest flawless stone and 
secondlargest diamond in the world goes on sale 10 days from now 
in new york probably to fetch the largest price ever at auction 
but the origins of this magnificent stone remain a mystery the 
present owners wont say where they got it 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
it came from the earth into unknown hands 
perhaps five to 10 years ago crusted dirty with no hint to the 
untrained eye of the golden heart inside it was likely born in the 
depths of africa no one knows when of demonical prehistoric fire 
and pressure 
now it has been denuded of the weathered coating and 
imperfections that cloaked its beauty and on oct 19 at 
christies in new york the highest bidder will own a flawless 
golden diamond of 40748 carats the largest flawless diamond in 
the world the secondlargest diamond in human hands worth 
whatever it will bring probably more than 20 million 
its recent history is a mystery someone in ghana or south 
africa or somewhere found it brought it out and sold it to someone 
else it passed from knowing hand to knowing hand 
it was mined by someone someone who found the piece of rock 
only one person says francois curiel the dapper 39yearold 
frenchman who heads christies jewelry department in new york then 
it went out of south africa either by a private route or through 
debeers the huge diamond trust or through another person 
there must have been an intermediary curiel says the 
present owners will not even tell christies how they got it or how 
much they paid curiel will not say how much it is insured for 
why 20 million curiel says i dont know the most 
expensive diamond ever sold was about 10 million but it was an 
85carat stone this is not a white stone which the previous 
recordholder was so you cant really compare it 
the worlds largest diamond the 53020 carat cullinan i the 
great star of south africa is set in great britains imperial 
sceptre part of the crown jewels and therefore out of 
circulation on display at the tower of london 
we dont believe the cullinan is flawless curiel says it 
was cut in 1911 and the field of gemology was more art than 
science now things are more precise more scientific nobody 
knows whether it is flawless or not 
christies counts on the fingers of both hands the number of 
potential buyers those with the money and the reason to sport such 
a stone 
it will be curiel says someone who wants the prestige of 
buying the largest flawless stone in the world either for a 
corporate seal or a scepter or for a tiara i do not believe it 
will be purchased by someone who will give it to his wife it 
will be a symbol of status 
christies has taken the diamond on the road to show prospective 
buyers hong kong tokyo los angeles london 
i dont travel with it curiel says i would be an obvious 
target 
so this queen of gems travels with a personal carrier sometimes 
an armored service or in the company of three or four armed guards 
it depends where it is going every country poses a different 
problem curiel says 
not so in the secure heart of christies curiel who is also an 
executive vice president and director of the firm casually 
interrupts a phone conversation and calls out diane the diamond 
please 
it arrives in dianes hand in a small black box that doesnt fit 
together properly inside it is nestled in a piece of oftenused 
tissue paper 
it took three years beginning in 1985 to cut the diamond from 
the 890carat stone in which it was mined diamond cutters do not 
work by the hour but by the carat 
an artisan jacques swaab began the job he worked for six 
months determining the most economical shape a shield or 
triolette a complicated asymmetrical triangular design more 
than 2 inches long about one and onethird inches wide and a 
fraction over an inch deep curiel who will conduct the auction 
points to a one quarterinch facet and says it probably took a 
month to make that one cut 
the cutting was finished this year by another artisan hy 
kessler and the diamond drew crowds on exhibit at the smithsonian 
institution in washington 
the final product fits easily in the palm of ones hand and 
weighs about as much as a cigarette lighter 
the current owners new york jewelry dealers marvin samuels and 
louis glick in partnership with the zale corp a retail chain 
headquartered in dallas dont explain their reluctance to reveal 
the diamonds origins 
april of this year was a big month for diamonds on april 19 
sothebys auctioned off an 8591carat white diamond for 
9310000 a day later christies sold a 5259carat stone for 
7480000 or a record percarat price of 142000 for a white 
diamond at that price per carat the new diamond would run over 57 
million but as curiel says they cant be compared 
in april 1987 he sold a rare red diamond weighing less than a 
carat for 880000 an alltime percarat record 
some 300 people will witness the auction but the principal 
bidders will probably be absent relying on agents or phoned bids 
understandable they dont like that kind of celebrity people 
following them around trying to sell them something else 
but in all likelihood the buyers name will be made public 
curiel says theres always a chance that the buyers name will 
become eternally linked to the gem its an opportunity for 
immortality

bees are buzzing around the griffith park 
carousel where they are filming the first episode of nbcs 
something is out there a series about a los angeles homicide 
detective and a beautiful alien from another planet who investigate 
things that go bump in the night 
joe cortese is the detective and maryam dabo is the alien 
reprising their roles from the hit miniseries last may that gave 
birth to the series but the outerspace monster that dabo chased 
in the miniseries has yielded to more downtoearth although 
equally spooky evils 
its not going to be a creature of the week show cortese 
says and its not going to be another cop show or romantic 
comedy itll have a supernatural element and our cases will be a 
little more eerie 
the gaiety at the carousel is interrupted by the screams of a 
young girl she jumps off a horse as cortese flashing his 
detectives badge tries to stop her she kicks him on the shin and 
runs off into the park 
in this episode the girl has telekinetic powers and she knows 
something is going to happen cortese explains two renegade 
intelligence agents are after her because her father invented a 
serum that gives her these powers they want to sell it to the 
highest bidder 
cortese plays detective jack breslin and dabo is tara in the 
fall series she will be earthbound but is still an alien with 
special powers the miniseries which topped abcs bourne 
identity and cbs the caine mutiny courtmartial in the 
ratings is now being packaged as a movie for theatrical release in 
europe and for videocassette release here 
theres going to be a lot of humor between this man and 
woman cortese says shell help him solve the cases with her 
power therell be bantering and some sexual tension between them 
but thats it theyll never get together 
cortese shoos away a honey bee attempting to take a swig of his 
soft drink then director richard colla who also did the 
miniseries calls him back for another take beneath the roof of the 
merrygoround which was built in 1932 for the san diego worlds 
fair and moved to griffith park in 1936 
later in his trailer dressing room cortese says breslin is 
a guy with a cynical sense of humor he can make fun of himself 
but he wont let anyone else make fun of him hes a diamond in the 
rough were trying to do a different show every kind of story you 
can do in a cop shows been done so were taking a risk its a 
new arena and it could be a hit or a miss 
cortese has had his share of misses he starred in the nbc movie 
cat squad which came a cropper two years ago he also stars 
in the forthcoming cat squad ii python wolf he was also in 
such movies as monsignor and windows 
ive been in this business a long time and ive never been in 
a hit he says i have been in a series of flops when this 
came on last may i never thought it would do as well as it did it 
was up against some tough competition but it came out on top i 
was pleasantly surprised 
before the miniseries came on people compared it to v which 
became an nbc series in 198485 after two successful miniseries it 
was about the conquest of earth by lizardlike space aliens 
this is much more accessible to the audience than v 
cortese says the audience is going to like this guy and girl 
after people saw the miniseries they started comparing it to 
moonlighting i think it stands on its own 
cortese met kim delaney when she played his girlfriend in the 
miniseries im absolutely crazy about her he says its the 
best relationship ive been in i didnt want to be in a 
relationship with an actress but when i met her that was it 
cortese grew up in paterson nj but attended midwestern 
college in denison iowa it was a cultural shock he says 
but a great learning experience i had to get away from my roots 
and find out who i was 
he began acting his sophomore year of college and after 
graduation worked in many regional theaters in the midwest 
cortese admits he was discouraged by the flops in his career 
but about four or five years ago i decided i wasnt going to 
blame myself for it he says i worked hard to change myself i 
stopped drinking i started working with more unfortunate people i 
donated my time to help other people i took therapy and when i 
did that little by little it changed me and i had a better life

when karen curlee and her two sisters used to 
sing as the curlee sisters their mother had dreams of their 
becoming as famous as lawrence welks lennon sisters but it was 
the 60s and girl groups were passe 
but one decades passe is a later decades nostalgia today 
karen curlee is one of the four singing actresses appearing in 
the taffetas an offbroadway hit at the cherry lane theater 
they play four rather naive singing sisters living in muncie 
ind in the 1950s and making an outoftown appearance as a group 
called the taffetas 
were not a slick girls group curlee says we havent 
gotten that far 
curlee at 34 and her sister taffetas are too young to 
remember when songs like mockin bird hill patti page 
ricochet teresa brewer mr sandman chordettes 
dedicated to the one i love shirelles and sincerely 
mcguire sisters cover of a moonglows hit were on the hit 
parade 
audiences at the cherry lane range from people who do remember 
those songs with nostalgia to younger listeners curious about what 
was pop just before rock to girls admiring the taffetas prom 
dresses 
the other taffetas are tia speros of san francisco jody 
abrahams of chicago and melanie mitchell of hartford conn 
mitchell has sung in a show set in the 1940s playing patti 
andrews of the andrews sisters on tv she has been angela a rich 
girl who got into drugs on another world and judy a mean 
highschool cheerleader on as the world turns 
curlee from fresno calif became a taffeta just before the 
cherry lane theater opening in august when susan carson left to 
play grizabella the memory cat in cats in vienna curlee 
had been understudying five cats in cats on broadway for two 
years 
the taffetas is the brainchild of rick lewis whos onstage 
playing piano at the cherry lane with two other musicians 
researching 50s music he was amazed to find doris days record 
of a bushel and a peck i thought my mother made that up to 
put the kids to sleep 
now hes working on fourpart harmony for santa baby an 
eartha kitt hit 34 years before madonna recorded it to insert into 
the show before christmas 
he thought of the name a takeoff on the chiffons then the 
image the mcguire sisters 
they captured what the 50s singing group was like gorgeous 
great teeth and smiles and they sang incredibly he says 
the taffetas arent singing notefornote the 50s arrangements 
but if you dont hear something that sounds like what you 
remember lewis says you cant really remember it 
lewis also picked the taffetas hometown muncie ind a place 
none of the quartet ever has been he visited there for journalism 
seminars from his high school in dayton ohio 
the taffetas have been written about recently on page 1 of the 
muncie star under the headline natives of a town they never 
knew were giving everybody from muncie free tickets to see 
the show if they can prove it curlee says 
in college lewis studied music education then did some acting 
and musical directing he moved to new york thinking hed pursue 
both he included on his resume his ohio musical directing credits 
he got offered musical directing jobs often for industrial shows 
id build shows from scratch they would spend 50000 and it 
would be performed one night i did a show that was 100000 a few 
years ago trying for a reuseable cheaper approach he put 
together the taffetas 
we kept showcasing it for people who book those things the 
amount of people we fed and gave booze to over a twoyear period 
id like to spend that much on parties for my friends sometime 
theyd say when youve got reviews let us know 
so lewis took the taffetas into two new york cabarets dont 
tell mama and westbeth cabaret theater i thought wed put a nice 
little brochure together instead we got fabulous reviews we were 
chased by producers wanting us offbroadway we made the best 
choice we took arthur whitelaw 
since the taffetas is an offbroadway hit there are offers 
for industrial shows conventions and parties 
asked what they think about the 1950s songs theyre singing 
speros says they have an underlying sweet smiling quality 
curlee says they sang much slower then my inner tempo as a 
34yearold woman is to lock in much faster 
mitchell says being slower you can understand the lyrics 
not having angst in the voice makes a more vulnerable innocent and 
youthful sound i think this music grows on you for me it does 
abrahams says i love the lyrics i think i cried patti 
page is one of the most beautiful songs it pulls on those 
heartstrings 
the taffetas were photographed with patti page when she sang 
recently at a new york nightspot she does a lot of our songs 
lewis says with a smile

while some demonstrators shout yankee 
go home vastly more asians want just the opposite a continued 
strong economic and political american presence in their region 
a pervading fear is that the united states indeed might adopt a 
new isolationist mood leaving asia prey to more agressive and 
military powers 
despite sharp antiamerican protests in south korea and the 
philippines and festering disputes on trade issues experts and 
officials believe the united states has rarely enjoyed such broadly 
based popularity in asia as it does today 
us and chinese leaders huddle regularly traditionally prickly 
relations with india are on the mend and onetime enemy vietnam is 
keen to establish diplomatic ties 
on many days filipino demonstrators are outnumbered by those 
lined up at the us embassy in manila for visas to emigrate or 
study in the united states 
in burma tens of thousands of demonstrators trying to topple an 
authoritarian government have applauded the american flag in 
rallies outside the us embassy in rangoon 
published material and interviews by the associated press with 
officials in various asian countries indicate that a large 
crosssection of asians are apprehensive that the soviet union and 
foreseeably china and japan would fill the vacuum left by a 
shrinking us presence 
the us role in the western pacific is vital to the security 
and stability of noncommunist asia and is very much in 
singapores national interest said prime minister lee kuan yew 
of singapore although speaking shortly after a us diplomat was 
expelled last may for allegedly meddling in singapores affairs 
lee described us power as benevolent benign 
in a sharp turnabout from the vietnam war era american 
officialdom finds itself trying to persuade asians that the united 
states is not becoming isolationistminded 
i think the unease is with american will and commitment does 
the us really have the will to hold tough and stand us 
assistant secretary of state gaston sigur said in an interview 
some senior us foreign policy makers privately express 
disappointment that the united states is not taking full advantage 
of proamerican sentiments in asia they maintain that private 
american business doesnt try hard enough in asian markets that 
us lawmakers create a backlash by pushing protectionist trade 
legislation and that washington doesnt spend enough to promote 
general american interests 
we have to grasp the moment sigur said 
what also worries washington is that the two hotbeds of 
antiamericanism in asia happen to be strategically vital 
in the philippines demonstrators demand the ouster of americas 
largest military bases outside the continental united states 
in south korea radicals blame the division of the korean 
peninsula on the presence of 42000 us troops in their country 
if filipinos want to grow up they have to slay the american 
father image said foreign secretary raul manglapus of the 
philippines he was referring to the philippines former status as 
a us colony 
last year president corazon aquino discontinued 
philippineamerican friendship day on july 4 as a national holiday 
analysts generally agree the majority in both the philippines 
and south korea remain staunchly proamerican but say this 
sentiment could erode if opponents are effective in propagating 
their message and moderates find the antiamerican theme 
politically useful 
although the united states also stations troops in japan 
irritants in that bilateral relationship are largely economic 
our leverage with japan is declining so we have to use 
japanbashing to achieve things and this is causing a backlash 
said kent calder a japan specialist at princeton university in the 
united states 
although he and others characterize allaround ties as sound 
japanese farmers have staged demonstrations and burned an 
americanmade car one cattle farmer even committed suicide to 
protest the opening of their market to far cheaper us beef and 
oranges americans in turn see japanese imports swelling an 
already large us trade deficit 
the us market absorbs more than half the manufactured goods of 
noncommunist southeast asia eastern asia accounted for 107 
billion or 62 percent of the us trade deficit last year 
given such high economic stakes countries such as taiwan 
indonesia and thailand can be badly hurt by protectionist us 
legislation conversely the united states becomes a highly favored 
friend when a countrys products flow unhindered into us shopping 
malls and showrooms 
antiamerican feeling appears to be proportional to the 
intensity of direct us involvement especially military in an 
asian country

the state departments sigur ascribed the south korean 
demonstrations to korean nationalism reacting to the visible 
presence of another nations soldiers this sort of problem is 
difficult to eradicate entirely 
however this very military muscle is welcomed by much of the 
rest of asia including china which continues to have shaky 
relations with moscow while building what us diplomats call a 
solid mature manysided relationship with washington 
the soviet union is entrenched at vietnams cam ranh bay its 
largest military base outside the homeland and enjoys a close 
alliance with vietnam 
moscow has also made political and economic inititatives since 
1986 when general secretary mikhail s gorbachev declared in 
vladivostok in soviet asia that the soviet union is also an asian 
pacific country recently he offered to pull out of cam ranh bay 
if the united states terminated its air and naval stations in the 
philippines 
the real longterm and very difficult obstacle to remove is 
not the american bases but the soviet bases and military 
alliance the head of malaysias institute for strategic and 
international studies noordin sopiee wrote this year 
asians are also noting that japan has become the worlds fifth 
largest spender on defense and is taking a more aggressive role in 
international politics in countries like indonesia south korea 
china and the philippines japanese atrocities in world war ii are 
far from forgotten 
what kind of a leader is japan when it worries more about 
selling transistors than human rights asked an indonesian 
intellectual remarking that unlike the us embassy the japanese 
mission in jakarta shuns opposition figures for fear of losing the 
governments favor and business 
princetons calder said in comparison with the japanese 
juggernaut the us superpower is more appealing to many asians 
there are a lot of people after vietnam who see the us as more 
distant the lesser evil if you will they balance the generosity 
of the americans with the mercantilism the strategic approach of 
japan 
to offset what many asians call japans economic invasion 
they urge the united states to increase its trade aid and 
investment in asia the japanese have outpaced the united states in 
all three in recent years official development assistance by japan 
to asian countries in 1987 was 34 billion in contrast to less 
than 900 million from washington 
us policy makers also say the democratic wave that has in 
recent years swept the philippines south korea taiwan and now 
burma along with the economic failures of asias communist 
societies are in the us interest 
the emerging democracies they say are not only closer to the 
us system and spirit but also eliminate the earlier dilemma of 
the united states propping up rightwing anticommunist dictators 
this had been a source of antiamericanism in the past

after centuries at the center of a 
tugofwar between germany and france this city nestled on a 
tranquil river now harmonizes french joie de vivre with german 
efficiency 
strasbourg is a symbol says deputy mayor germain muller 
who is in charge of the celebrations marking the citys 2000th 
anniversary this year france and germany which often fought 
over this place are now the countries leading us toward a united 
europe 
pope john paul ii will spend four days beginning oct 8 in 
this city between west germanys black forest and frances vosges 
mountains he will address the entity that symbolizes european 
unity the european parliament which meets in the chambers of the 
council of europe 
in coming to strasbourg the pope will not find a better place 
to illustrate reconciliation an appropriate theme at a time when 
the roman catholic church in the area is shaken by a traditionalist 
schism 
memories of the nazi occupation are fresh enough to cause 
strasbourgeois as the local people are called to feel 
passionately french 
taxi drivers boast that the french national anthem the 
marseillaise was written here shopkeepers mention that napoleon 
bonaparte came here to go to school the city is still the biggest 
university town in eastern france 
they mention less often however that goethe studied here too 
or that johann gutenberg spent a decade in strasbourg inventing the 
intricate press on which he later produced his bible the first 
book printed with movable type 
for centuries alsace and the neighboring region of lorraine were 
part of an independent republic bordering the rhine river from 
1870 to 1945 the region passed regularly back and forth between 
german and french hands 
the bicultural history is felt today in nearly every aspect of 
daily life from the bildings on the street to the music on the 
radio even the names of city streets reveal strasbourgs seesaw 
history 
in 1871 avenue napoleon became kaiser wilhelmstrasse after the 
germans moved in that was changed to boulevard de la republique 
after world war i then for some years it was known as adolf hitler 
strasse until it was given its current name avenue charles de 
gaulle when the french reclaimed the city at the end of world war 
ii 
the avenue today is filled with a blitzkrieg of german tourists 
who arrive by the busload in this city of 400000 just two miles 
from the west german border they are outnumbered only by french 
sightseers who stroll through the narrow medieval streets of 
halftimbered houses past outdoor cafes and hidden courtyards and 
over picturesque bridges on the ill river 
many people speak both german and french and older people often 
are fluent in alsatian the regional linguistic hybrid 
the intertwining of cultures has produced a cuisine that melds 
german ingredients and french knowhow to cook up regional dishes 
like choucroute sauerkraut and smoked meat cooked in wine 
kronenbourg beer is brewed here rhine wines in a dry french 
style are produced nearby 
cuisines and languages have blended with ease the regions two 
religions have not unlike most of france which is 80 percent 
roman catholic alsacelorraine is half protestant 
when a protestant girl married a catholic boy here it used to 
be considered a disgrace except for a very few small villages 
its not that way anymore said city councilman gilbert roos 
whose father was a medical officer in the german army in world war 
i and in the french army in world war ii 
roos said the two groups now live in harmony the discord these 
days is within the catholic church itself 
in june a longbrewing dispute between the vatican and catholic 
traditionalists culminated in the excommunication of rebel 
archbishop marcel lefebvre it was the first schism within the 
roman catholic church in more than a century and has led to 
repeated calls by the french hierarchy for unity in the face of the 
challenge posed by lefebvre and his flock 
as he did on a trip to france two years ago pope john paul is 
likely to stress loyalty to rome on this visit which begins at 
strasbourgs massive cathedral a dramatic setting for the popes 
first speech 
built between 1190 and 1489 by master french and rhineland 
craftsmen the pink sandstone cathedral rises 465 feet and was the 
highest building in the christian world until a century ago 
inside is an astronomical clock of ingenious works at 1230 
each afternoon a bell is struck by a figure representing death 
while the 12 apostles receive the blessing of christ and a cock 
beating its wings crows three times in memory of peters denial 
a perpetual calendar on the clock calculates the phases of the 
moon solar eclipses and rising and setting of the sun 
while here the pope also will speak at both the european 
parliament and council of europe 
the presence of these two european institutions has stirred the 
ambitions of some local boosters 
it is not surprising the pope is coming here said roos 
one day we wont be just another beautiful city someday we will 
be the capital of europe

from elia kazans america america to john boormans hope 
and glory remembrance of childhood has made stirring films they 
require selective memory and an artistic soul those factors 
unfortunately are missing in stealing home 
steven kaupmann and will addis sitcom writers who graduated to 
such features as back to school and the couch trip thought 
it would be a dandy idea to write a movie script based on their 
experiences of growing up in the 1960s not only write it but 
direct it together 
despite good performances and one that is exceptional 
stealing home becomes a mishmash chaotic in structure and full 
of momentous scenes that dont come off 
the title itself is a misguided attempt at allegory 
the biggest moment in billy bryants young life was stealing 
home in a crucial baseball game the moment is replayed at the end 
of the film to illustrate the regeneration of the adult billy now 
trying for a minor league comeback even with all the slomo 
effects and the portentous music the scene has no more impact than 
a thirdbase bunt 
the movie opens with mark harmon the adult billy bryant on the 
skids we know hes on the skids because he is swilling booze with 
a bimbo in a thirdrate motel and sports a don johnson stubble he 
learns that his boyhood friend and lover katie chandler jodie 
foster has committed suicide and has designated him to dispose of 
her ashes 
thus begins billy bryants pilgrimage to his old home grounds 
and into his past this requires a procession of flashbacks to 
billys happy family his baseball prowess his fathers untimely 
death the strong friendship with the eccentric katie 
there might have been a heartwarming film in these 
reminiscences but the time frames are juxtaposed confusingly and 
there are even flashbacks within flashbacks the star of the film 
mark harmon appears in about a halfhour of footage the teenage 
billy being played quite effectively by william mcnamara 
jodie foster has the role of her young life and she plays it 
brilliantly she captures the quicksilver qualities of katie 
dominating the screen whenever she appears within the constraints 
of his role harmon performs ably but the reasons for his torment 
are never made clear 
the warner bros release was produced by thom mount and hank 
moonjean the rating is pg13 for language and sexual content

broadcast news cbsfox video vhsbeta 8998 rated r 
 
one advantage in seeing broadcast news at home is the 
opportunity to give the film a more satisfying ending than the 
feeble conclusion reached by director james l brooks just stop 
when youve had enough at least two good opportunities will arise 
and savor the satisfaction of saving a film in the cutting room 
for most of its length though broadcast news is a witty 
and often hilarious human comedy set in the highpressure world of 
network journalism this highly praised film inexplicably was 
snubbed at the academy award ceremonies after winning seven 
nominations however holly hunter deservedly won bestactress 
awards from critics in new york and los angeles 
hunter and albert brooks play bright dedicated and tough news 
professionals who worry about the inroads of fluffy feature stories 
and blowdried airheads on the anchor desk we know they are the 
very best of journalists because they say so rather often 
their media eden is invaded by a blowdried airhead snake named 
tom grunick william hurt however tom establishes himself as a 
sympathetic figure hes the only character who appears to have any 
humility admitting that hes no genius and forthrightly asking 
help from jane craig hunter what he knows is how to look good 
and sound smart and he generously offers tips on anchoring to 
aaron altman brooks perhaps knowing that the neurotic aaron is 
no competition 
jane runs at such a high pitch that she often loses perspective 
when her boss sarcastically tells her that it must be great to 
always be the smartest person in the room she takes him seriously 
no its awful she sobs 
though brooks and hurt turn in firstclass performances this is 
holly hunters movie and it runs on her energy its not just the 
two guys in the film who will fall in love with her

switching channels rcacolumbia vhsbeta 8995 rated pg 
 
switching channels a film of romantic antics in a satellite 
tv station had the bad luck of appearing in movie houses last 
march several months after broadcast news a far better satire 
of the tv news business 
but lets be fair dont compare switching channels to 
broadcast news or to classics on the same newsroom theme from 
which it was derived the front page and his girl friday 
no switching channels is so silly predictable miscast and 
lost in its lame attempt at broad comedy that a more apt comparison 
would be to francis the talking mule 
kathleen turner plays an ace reporter at a chicago tv station 
burt reynolds is her boss and exhusband turner takes a vacation 
and meets christopher reeve a wealthy new york manufacturer of 
sporting goods including ha ha jockstraps they fall in love and 
turner agrees to go east and leave burt and the news biz behind 
wily burt is having none of that he hooks turner into covering 
one last big story the execution of a convicted cop killer played 
by henry gibson 
when its all over and turner must decide between reeve and 
reynolds the only question becomes how could someone supposedly so 
smart wind up torn between such a pair of shnooks and do you 
really care which she choses 
turner does the most with limp material reynolds usually very 
good in such broad comedy never gets started here reeve who 
showed flashes of drollery as superman is miserably miscast as a 
foppish brainless rich boy whos scared of elevators 
director ted kotcheff seems willing to let the actors drift and 
mug pretty much as they will

chimes of freedom columbia records bruce springsteen 
 
this extended play recording was released to coincide with the 
sixweek human rights now global tour now under way featuring 
bruce springsteen sting peter gabriel and a host of other 
musicians with some of the eps proceeds donated to the human 
rights group amnesty international 
the discs four songs were all recorded live during 
springsteens 1988 tunnel of love tour the opening tougher 
than the rest already appears on that album this live version 
recorded at the los angeles sports arena has a slower more 
countrytinged tempo to it and wraps up nicely with fine harmonica 
work by springsteen 
be true recorded at the joe louis arena in detroit is what 
springsteen fans would call typical b side bruce the artist 
has a penchant for putting catchy danceable tunes on the flip 
sides of his singles that arent included on any album 
backed as always by the hardrocking e street band 
springsteen croons to the fictional heroine you be true to me 
and ill be true to you isnt it kind of tacky for springsteen 
whose split with wife julianne phillips made all the gossip columns 
during his tour to include this song here 
incidentally vocals by backup singer patti scialfa with whom 
springsteen is now involved are far more prominent on this ep than 
on any previous recording 
chimes of freedom the third song is alone worth buying 
this ep for the bob dylan protest song is the perfect anthem for 
the amnesty international tour and springsteens rendering 
recorded in stockholm sweden is faithful to the original the 
artist whose lyrics were often compared to dylans early in his 
career proves he can salute his influences and still add something 
uniquely his own to their songs 
by far the most ambitious of the four songs is springsteens 
acoustic version of born to run also recorded in los angeles 
that song was the artists signature tune before being replaced by 
born in the usa and it had the raw power of a motorcycle 
opened up at full throttle 
however springsteen who has proven himself an accomplished 
accoustic artist with nebraska and several cuts on tunnel of 
love falls flat here his vocals meander all over the place like 
a leonard cohen prosepoem and the impression is one of the 
motorcycle run out of gas and being pushed along like a scooter

still live ecm keith jarrett trio 
 
jazz pianist keith jarrett who unlike many of his 
electronicminded contemporaries still plays only the piano has 
never sounded better than in this twodisc live recording 
communicating intuitively with bassist gary peacock and drummer 
jack dejohnette jarrett combined his signature moody chord 
voicings with sharp improvising in a collection of jazz standards 
for a concert audience in munich west germany 
he took the songs familiar melodies and stretched twisted and 
bent them in fascinating ways the listener is never lost though 
and he ends each journey back at the beginning exhilarated and 
ready for another 
jarretts interpretation of my funny valentine was 
understated and sensitive while when i fall in love became a 
ballad with a bit of an attitude 
come rain or come shine had just the right bluesy edge only 
the song is you a kernhammerstein composition failed to 
achieve a groove that matched its length nearly 17 minutes 
keith jarrett is an intelligent pianist who has done his share 
of experimenting still live with its classic tunes played on 
acoustic piano should give purists plenty to cheer about

day by day emimanhattan najee 
 
najee sets a mellow groove on his second lp day by day and 
never strays very far from the course 
the album is always tasteful with the new yorkers soaring 
saxophone solos taking center stage and showing his jazz and rhythm 
and blues influences backup singers dart in and out of the 
arrangements keeping things moving along smoothly 
but the album tends to be swallowed up by its tastefulness and 
often fades into backround music while this album can be the 
perfect accompaniment to a romantic dinner it unfortunately is 
just as appropriate later on when the dishes are being washed 
only najees nasty groove a funky track dominated by drums 
and synthesizer breaks the mold 
anyone in the market for some easy listening jazz could do worse 
than this album but those looking for something more well 
inspiring would do well to keep on looking

sigourney weaver has been known as a 
courageous actress but as the late naturalist dian fossey in 
gorillas in the mist she has outdone herself 
in earlier films she battled outer space demons alien 
aliens revolution the year of living dangerously and 
evil spirits ghostbusters the new movie shows her in 
conditions of genuine peril working with silverback gorillas in 
the mountain jungles of rwanda without a double or net nothing 
between her and a beast that could crush her in an instant 
fossey was murdered in rwanda in her sleep her colleagues who 
considered her an eccentric said she had angered local residents 
with her aggressive efforts to restrict poaching 
weaver 38 was born into the entertainment business her father 
is sylvester pat weaver the nbc president considered to be the 
architect of modern television her mother is the former actress 
elizabeth inglis after stanford university and the yale school of 
drama she worked her way from offbroadway to films 
on a recent visit from her new york home she talked about her 
african experience in an interview with the associated press 
q you dont pick easy pictures do you 
a laughing thats probably true my father says that if i 
open a script and it takes place in alaska with a lot of huskies 
and i fall through the ice ill probably do it instead of a lovely 
picture on the french riviera 
q did you know about dian fossey and her work 
a i had gotten her book when it first came out i had also been 
at stanford when they started that humanprimate program where you 
could live with an ape in your trailer and do your thesis on it 
jane goodall had come and spoken to us 
after i read dians book gorillas in the mist i thought 
they cant make a picture out of this she is too difficult a 
woman to be portrayed on the screen i also thought logistically 
it would be a nightmare how could you possibly create the whole 
atmosphere of the gorillas 
q were you involved in the joining of universal and warner 
bros which had competing projects 
a no i was approached by each studio separately by the time 
producer arnie glimcher approached me for universal i said 
arnie i dont want to get involved with a picture thats not 
going to happen i thought they would knock each other out 
q once the deal was made werent you overwhelmed by the danger 
involved 
a not really i was reading a lot of dians papers and 
rereading her book and it seemed that she was often threatened by 
gorillas but they never actually hurt her it was all a question 
of getting to know each other 
i didnt see why they would feel animosity toward me that was a 
lucky choice on my part i dont think it would be wise go in and 
to work with animals without having previously reassured yourself 
that you would be all right 
i was intimidated by trying to gather all the information about 
dian so much of it was conflicting and so much of it was hearsay 
she had a very negative reputation within her field and she was 
considered to be a very difficult woman i heard people say some 
pretty hard things about her and some very loving things as well 
q what kind of a person was she 
a she was a mass of opposites i think everything you can say 
about dian the opposite is probably true she loved people she 
loved partying on the other hand she shunned people she 
preferred to be with animals she lived up in this isolated place 
tramping around in mud yet she loved to go out in fancy clothes 
she always slept with curlers in her hair even when she lived up 
on top of the mountain 
she is such an amazing collection of different things i guess i 
grew very fond of her i was lucky to have access to her letters 
and her camp notes through a colleague of hers she really put 
herself in those letters i developed such an admiration for her 
thoroughness her commitment her humor she was always making 
jokes about herself she had a wicked sense of humor and i hope 
that comes across in the film 
q did you train for the rigors of the location 
a in the press release it says i ran up these volcanic 
mountains in hawaii laughing i dont know where they got that i 
did walk up a hill behind my parentsinlaws house in hawaii every 
morning for about two weeks i dont think any of us could have 
gotten in shape for the location you had to get used to the 
altitude and slowly get used to the climbs it was difficult for 
everyone except the australians they were very macho about the 
whole thing 
you were in such a beautiful part of the world and you were 
perhaps going to see gorillas at the end of the climb or you were 
going to the top of the mountain to shoot a scene 
q what was your first encounter with the gorillas 
a we didnt think we were going to see gorillas that day it 
turned out they were only 5 minutes away from dians camp we took 
off through a beautiful forest filled with wild orchids we heard a 
great outburst of pockpock sounds which is the sound they make 
beating their chests i looked up and saw this big gorilla standing 
halfway up the hill 
youre so amazed to suddenly be in their territory it was like 
you had walked into another era i just forgot i was so entranced 
it was like walking into a forest and seeing a unicorn you forgot 
your fear you just went ahead 
i went up to where they were all sitting around munching though 
i couldnt see them this little gorilla came out to me and sat 
down and touched my camera she was very curious taking me in in a 
matteroffact way she jumped away after she had visited and i 
was agog it was an indescribable feeling 
i just found out last week that that sweet little girl had been 
caught in a poachers trap and she didnt make it there arent 
many females and coming from a very good family she would have 
been a good mate 
q were you wellcoached on how to behave with the gorillas 
a i kind of learned it as i went along in the picture are a 
couple of scary scenes where the silverback comes down right next 
to me they all happened the first times we went out so i was kind 
of thrown into the deep end

the lifes work of sculptor henry moore has gone 
on show in london in a comprehensive way that was never managed 
while he lived 
we discussed an exhibition with him in 1984 to mark his 90th 
birthday this year but he died in 1986 now this is his 
memorial said roger de grey president of the royal academy of 
arts 
the venerable academy which has been presenting art exhibitions 
since 1768 has done moore proud spreading 112 sculptures and 127 
drawings by him through its 12 main galleries to show all the 
stages of his career 
there are giant abstract bronzes and lifesize human figures in 
stone that had to be lifted in by crane and little plaster figures 
smaller than a hand 
his famous drawings of restless sleepers who sought refuge in 
the london subway to escape bombings in world war ii also are 
shown along with sketches of coal miners trees elephants sheep 
landscapes and ideas for sculpture often based on bones stones 
and bits of wood which he picked up 
dr susan compton a british art historian who organized a 
popular exhibition of marc chagall at the philadelphia museum of 
art spent 15 months arranging the exhibition which ru a global thing 
thats 
where the small world concept came from 
the albums first single is the brassy perfect world written 
by alex call a longtime friend of lewis who used to be in his old 
countryrock band clover 
lewis said the second single will be an edited version of 
small world part one and the instrumental small world part 
two which features a guest appearance by jazz saxophonist stan 
getz 
i once went to a benefit show with my dad whos a jazz 
drummer and stan came up and introduced himself to me lewis 
recalled he said hey man why dont you let me play on some of 
your stuff i can play that stuff too then he gave me a card 
that said stan getz have sax will travel 
other album cuts are the 1960sstyle soul instrumental 
slammin the cajunsounding old antones which features a 
guest appearance by bruce hornsby on accordion the reggaetinged 
love song better be true and the pure reggae jam bobo tempo 
bobo tempo was written by sean and myself about 13 years ago 
when we were both in clover lewis said it was for a gig we 
had in bolinas calif bobo is a nickname for bolinas which is a 
nutty place we used to play out there every so often and there 
would be huge street parties 
we wrote the song just for that one gig just for a laugh 
really he said on the last day of the fore album 
sessions in 1986 we piled into the studio at midnight and cut 
that song the track really held up 
but not the video which involves a topless girl a surfer and a 
horse on a surfboard and probably will never be commercially 
released 
the cleftchinned lewis born hugh anthony cregg iii in new york 
city grew up near san francisco and was known as huey louie 
when he joined clover in 1972 he changed his name to huey lewis 
when he formed his band in late 1979 with hopper 35 hayes 30 
and three members of the bay area group soundhole gibson 36 
cipollina 33 and colla 36 
the group originally was called huey lewis and the american 
express but the name was quickly altered to avoid an infringment 
lawsuit 
their selftitled first album in 1980 went nowhere but the 
followup picture this in 1982 had the top 10 hits workin 
for a livin and do you believe in love next came the 
landmark sports album which has sold 9 million copies since 
its september 1983 release and won several grammy awards it 
spawned five top 10 singles including i want a new drug and 
heart of rock amp roll 
in 1985 the band had its first no 1 single with power of 
love an oscarnominated song recorded for the years 
largestgrossing movie back to the future 
the tour will take huey lewis and the news well into 1989 and 
mark their 10th anniversary together 
id be surprised if were not together another 10 years 
lewis said 
but its funny i still remember when we got our first 
paycheck from our manager bob brown i remember i told him i got 
to have 150 a week for these guys otherwise thats it it 
doesnt seem that long ago

the stories of the late flannery oconnor are 
best understood by whats left unsaid 
she said that it was the mystery what cannot be explained 
that made a story endlessly fascinating she didnt feel that gods 
ways were cut and dry there were always some surprises in store 
for everybody said sally fitzgerald a longtime friend of the 
late writer who has edited oconnors collected works library 
of america 30 
the anthology contains the georgia natives novels wise 
blood and the violent bear it away as well as such short 
stories as the artificial nigger and a good man is hard to 
find also included are essays and a large selection of letters 
mary flannery oconnor was born in savannah in 1925 the only 
child of regina cline and edward francis oconnor jr 
she began writing at an early age and set up an attic studio in 
her home as a work place one of her favorite books growing up was 
the humorous tales of edgar allan poe 
she contributed cartoons and articles to her high school 
newspaper and entered georgia state college for women in 1942 
while in college she began signing her academic work flannery 
oconnor 
in 1945 she received a scholarship in journalism from the 
university of iowa she gained admission to the writers workshop 
where she began reading the works of james joyce franz kafka and 
william faulkner 
she was influenced by the workshop fitzgerald said she 
learned to spend a certain number of hours writing every day at the 
same time she let nothing interfere with it she was very 
disciplined about it 
oconnor received a master of fine arts degree in 1947 that 
same year she began working on wise blood her first novel it 
took five years and endless revisions before the book was published 
she certainly suffered writing fitzgerald said writing 
was very hard for her she was a real perfectionist she discarded 
more than 2000 sheets from wise blood 
ideas explored and abandoned working through inferences 
working through bad solutions to good solutions making that book 
absolutely her own 
wise blood tells the story of hazel motes an intense young 
man who arrives in a small city in georgia determined to form a 
church without christ 
in a letter dated march 2 1954 oconnor gave her own 
interpretation of wise blood 
wise blood is about a protestant saint written from the 
point of view of a catholic first you must accept the fact 
that this book is by someone who believes that there was a fall 
has been a redemption and will be a judgment this is what i 
believe as a catholic and what i imply that haze could not get away 
from 
man and god the struggle against grace redemption they were 
the major themes of oconnors stories and her life 
redemption and incarnation was central to her fitzgerald 
said she thought of herself as writing from a catholic point of 
view this is what all catholics believe everything has a 
meaning 
fitzgerald met oconnor in 1949 she was quite silent she 
didnt talk a lot she listened very carefully if you were aware 
you realized you were in the presence of someone listening and 
watching very carefully 
in oconnors stories the eyes are often the most important 
features of her characters faces fitzgerald says the same was 
true for oconnor herself 
she was a young girl not particularly striking until you 
looked at her eyes which were blue and penetrating she was a 
sandyhaired girl not somebody you would notice 
in 1950 oconnor began to suffer pains and heaviness in her 
arms and shoulder joints although at first she laughed off the 
symptoms as psychosomatic an excuse not to write oconnor was 
eventually diagnosed as having lupus an incurable disease that 
eventually killed her in 1964 
she bore it very well we heard no complaints she was quite 
funny about it fitzgerald said 
she had no idea what it was at first when she learned how 
serious it was she must have been shocked her father had died of 
the same disease he died when she was 15 
despite her weakened condition oconnor continued to work until 
her death she completed a second novel published two collections 
of short stories and was a prolific letter writer 
she moved back to georgia in 1950 and lived in milledgeville 
with her mother for the rest of her life 
she believed in a characters capacity to change with grace 
fitzgerald said she lived in the south which was largely 
protestant there were a number of doityourself religions she 
was fascinated by what they would come up with 
in a 1957 essay the church and the fiction writer oconnor 
summed up how religion shaped her writing 
the catholic writer in so far as he has the mind of the 
church will feel life from the standpoint of the central christian 
mystery that it has for all its horror been found by god to be

rising country music performer keith 
whitley says his career is just getting started even though hes 
been singing on the road for 18 years 
the 33yearold singer hit the top of the country music charts 
in august with the single dont close your eyes the album of 
the same name has been in the top 10 
were at the point where all systems are go said whitley 
whose honkytonk style of singing is traditional country music with 
lyrics embracing pain and joy that sounds odd for somebody whos 
been on the road for about 20 years 
he was only 15 when he and friend ricky skaggs a year older 
joined ralph stanleys clinch mountain boys a bluegrass band like 
whitley skaggs eventually became a solo country singer 
whitley then survived his remaining reckless teenage years and 
battled a stubborn drinking problem to become one of country 
musics emerging stars along with randy travis and dwight yoakam 
ive been in this business for a long long time he said in 
an interview but from the musical standpoint and a personal 
standpoint were really just at the beginning of my career 
as a carefree teen in sandy hook ky he bought bootleg 
bourbon poured it down his thirsty throat and then enjoyed 
challenging the rural roads at breathless speeds deep in appalachia 
basically when i was growing up the only thing we did for 
pastime was go to bootleggers and get something to drink and ride 
around and drink it and drive around and see how fast you could 
take those mountain curves he recalled 
at age 17 he was in a car with a companion who attempted to 
round a curve at 120 mph the car wrecked killing his friend 
the doctor told me i came close to breaking my neck said 
whitley who was cut but not hurt in the accident 
at 19 he drove off a 120foot cliff into a frozen river 
escaping with a broken collarbone 
there were a lot more less serious accidents and brushes with 
the law he said 
but always he was intrigued by music he played with stanleys 
band on the weekends as a teenager and later was lead singer for 
jd crowe and the new south a countrybluegrass band 
after earning the reputation as a fine musician and singer he 
moved to nashville in the mid1980s and landed a recording contract 
with rca records his hits besides dont close your eyes 
include miami my amy ten feet away homecoming 63 and 
hard livin 
he quit drinking in 1987 
it was a matter of life and death he said if i hadnt 
stopped drinking i dont think id be alive today i did so many 
crazy things while drinking 
whitley who is married to grand ole opry singer lorrie morgan 
said his lifestyle intensified his music 
not to sound conceited but ive lived breathed and cried 
this music since i was 3 or 4 years old whitley said i take 
it very seriously most of the things i sing in my songs ive 
lived 
i dont wish the others would have to go through that but i 
believe ive got the credentials to sing some of the things i sing 
about where some others dont 
the whole deal with my music has been the emotional quality 
songs i do have to strike an emotional chord the first time i sing 
them its not uncommon for me to get so wrapped up in a song that 
i cry several times when i sing them thats the difference between 
my music and some of the other folks 
his dont close your eyes is about the desperation of love 
people identified with it women seemed to like it and they 
are a big part of the recordbuying public at shows people often 
come up to me and say they feel like it was written about them 
the melody is real mournful you can get lost emotionally 
singing it 
one of the songs on the album is i never go around mirrors 
a hit years ago by the late country star lefty frizzell 
whitley had a verse added to the song a few hours before he 
recorded it he visited frizzells grave and wept 
that sounds weird to people but his music was very important 
to me growing up whitley said people dont understand why i did 
that but it meant a lot to me

women who exercise enough to disrupt their 
menstrual periods may suffer an irreversible loss of strength in 
their bones that could lead to serious fractures or a kind of 
premature aging new studies suggest 
a 24yearold woman whose periods are irregular can have the 
bones of a 50yearold said dr charles h chesnut of the 
university of washington once that loss has occurred it appears 
theres very little we can do about it 
the bone loss can lead to potentially serious spinal fractures 
and to less serious stress fractures that will keep women from 
exercising 
women can regain regular periods by reducing their level of 
exercise but the bones dont seem to fully recover said chesnut 
that attitude of some of the womens running gurus has been a 
bit irresponsible said dr robert marcus of stanford university 
in palo alto calif they basically take the cavalier view that 
yes if you stop everything comes back 
recreational athletes or women who are just trying to stay fit 
dont suffer disruption of periods chesnut said 
the loss or disruption of menstrual periods known technically 
as amenorrhea occurs most in runners cyclists swimmers and 
ballet dancers said anne loucks a research endocrinologist at the 
university of california san diego and an authority on the effect 
of exercise on women 
researchers dont know why intense exercise affects menstrual 
periods most people think its probably a combination of 
factors said barbara drinkwater an exercise and environmental 
physiologist at the pacific medical center in seattle who has 
collaborated with chesnut 
how much of the problem is due to exercise how much is due to 
nutrition how much is due to psychological stress i dont think 
anyone can say with certainty she said 
estimates of the frequency vary widely said loucks with some 
researchers reporting the problem in only a few percent of athletes 
and others reporting some disruption of periods in as many as 40 
percent of women athletes 
chesnut said the women he and drinkwater studied did not begin 
to have problems until they were running 30 miles to 35 miles per 
week or more that threshhold varies from one individual to the 
next he said 
for most women who are only trying to stay in shape keep 
their weight down and are running 10 to 20 miles a week there is 
no cause for concern as long as their periods remain regular 
exercise is of benefit for a woman at any age so long as it is kept 
in perspective and does not result in a loss of periods he said 
drinkwater underscored the point we want to be very sure that 
people dont get the idea that exercise causes low bone mass 
exercise is beneficial to bone its the amenorrhea thats 
responsible for the decrease of bone density 
women whose periods remain normal can exercise all they like 
drinkwater said i dont think we want to frighten women away 
from exercise what we want to say is be sensible in your 
approach to it 
loucks also notes that many things can cause a woman to lose 
regular menstrual periods a woman who stops menstruating 
definitely should consult with her gynecologist to rule out other 
possibilities 
getting women athletes to the doctor isnt always easy however 
they view themselves as very healthy she said its very 
hard to convince them they have a problem 
in february one researcher seemed to reinforce that notion by 
suggesting that women who begin running vigorously before puberty 
may face a decreased cancer risk later in life 
the researcher rose e frisch of the harvard school of public 
health in boston said girls who exercise in elementary school can 
delay the onset of puberty and may thereby lower their breast 
cancer risk 
loucks expressed reservations about that view saying frischs 
studies of young runners did not document disruptions in menstrual 
periods 
that is not correct said frisch we documented them in 
the greatest detail 
marcus was more forceful in his criticism it boggles the mind 
that a reasonable investigator would say something like that she 
obviously did not do a study in which she followed women for 40 
years watching them develop or not develop cancer 
frisch said many other studies support her findings and she 
emphasized that the studies only suggest that delaying puberty 
would reduce breast cancer risk i have no guarantee that it 
would she said 
the mechanism of bone loss in amenorrheic women is not 
completely clear but researchers say they do have a plausible 
hypothesis 
women who have lost their periods do not produce as much of the 
female sex hormone estrogen which leads to calcium loss so the 
researchers assume that exerciserelated bone loss is due to the 
low estrogen levels in the amenorrheic athletes loucks said 
the same thing happens after menopause leading to the disorder 
called osteoporosis characterized by loss of calcium and fragile 
bones 
loucks said the underlying disorder that triggers the amenorrhea 
in exercising women appears to be in the brain perhaps in the 
hypothalamus which controls the bodys hormonal system the 
hypothalamus sends signals to the pituitary gland which in turn 
regulates hormone production 
chesnut and drinkwater found that women who stop exercising and 
regain menstrual periods can recover some but probably not all of 
the lost bone 
because bone loss is difficult or impossible to remedy doctors 
must focus on prevention chesnut said we want to get to these 
women athletes as soon as possible after amenorrhea occurs within 
five to six months certainly and presumably get them on estrogen 
replacement so we can prevent that loss before its occurred 
because once that loss has occurred it appears theres very little 
we can do about it 
estrogen may not be suitable for all women however some 
researchers have linked estrogen treatment which is often 
prescribed for women after menopause with an increased risk of 
cancer especially breast cancer others have found no risk 
its something that needs to be studied said chesnut i 
would not want all physicians to start putting all of their 
amenorrheic women on estrogens at the time of amenorrhea 
giving calcium alone does not seem to prevent the bone loss he 
said 
marcus acknowledged that some serious competitive athletes may 
be unwilling to reduce the intensity of their exercise but he 
noted that the bone weakness itself may ultimately force them to 
stop exercising

now that scientists have found the gene 
that makes a man a man some of them would like to see equal rights 
for the gene that makes a woman a woman 
last winter dr david page of the whitehead institute in 
cambridge mass announced the discovery of what appears to be the 
male sex trigger a bit of genetic material that separates the 
boys from the girls 
if page is right there is one sex switch those who get this 
gene at conception will be boys those who dont will be girls 
page has offered a variety of explanations but many scientists 
assume it means there is a gene for masculinity and not for 
femininity 
one researcher who disagrees with this assumption is dr eva m 
eicher a geneticist at the jackson laboratory in bar harbor she 
said she has no quarrel with page only with how his discovery is 
interpretted 
there is sexism in biology eicher said there is no 
question about it it influences the way that biologists approach 
problems such as sex determination 
even the language of genetics such as dominant and 
recessive carry subconscious connotations about the roles of 
men and women she said 
according to her theory and she emphasizes its only that 
the genetic library of the human race contains two sex genes one 
contains the instructions for building boys the other for making 
girls 
she said many experts believe a maleness gene is necessary to 
make testis and all the internal and external sex organs of 
manhood but for making females only the absence of this gene is 
necessary 
when it comes to sex the active process is testis and the 
passive or default process is ovary she said i dont think 
nature works by doing nothing there has to be an active pathway 
to womanhood 
dr elizabeth simpson of the clinical research center in harrow 
england agrees it may be simpleminded to think that you have a 
switch to go down one pathway but nothing to go down the other 
she said 
everybody is born with two strings of genes known as sex 
chromosomes that are called x and y women have two x chromosomes 
but men have an x and a y 
page found the gene that seems to control maleness on the y 
chromosome but he also found a closely related gene on the x 
chromosome nobody knows what that gene does 
eicher speculates that this is the female gene the process 
might work like this 
if an egg is fertilized by a male sperm the sex gene on its 
y chromosome kicks to life starting a chain reaction of hormones 
that eventually direct the fetus to become a boy among its jobs is 
shutting off the female sex gene on the x chromosome 
but if there is no y sex gene then a few hours later the x sex 
gene turns on starting the process toward womanhood 
this is mostly speculation although eicher said she has found a 
hint in some strains of mice that something like this could be 
going on but at least by challenging peoples assumptions she 
hopes to eventually get closer to the biological truth 
we think we know so much she said what i am continually 
amazed by is that we know almost nothing

when tim dennehy gets frustrated about the 
epa he starts talking about oreo cookies and milk 
dennehy says that if he believed oreos could control insects and 
he wanted to dangle them in a field the environmental protection 
agency would force him to do a battery of tests to learn if the 
cookies were an environmental threat 
at this point i dont know if thats an exaggeration says 
dennehy who spent two years getting permits to test pheromones 
chemicals that insects produce to communicate as an alternative 
to pesticides 
he and pheromone expert wendell roelofs have devised a compound 
simulating the mating scent of female grape berry moths dennehy 
says it is as safe as spraying milk on crops can replace up to 
12 pounds of insecticides and doesnt even kill the bugs it is 
meant to control 
james touhey an epa adviser acknowledges that regulations for 
toxic pesticides are unnecessarily stringent for such nontoxic 
alternatives but is confident that ways can be found to simplify 
the process 
pheromones are in their infancy in terms of practical use 
says richard ridgway head of the insect chemical ecology 
laboratory at the agricultural research service in beltsville md 
about 250 pheromones have been identified since their discovery 
in 1959 and some are being used ridgway says including one to 
control the cotton boll weevil and another on the oriental fruit 
moth on california peaches 
however they never lived up to their early promise companies 
cant make enough profit because they only work for one species 
limiting the market they are not successful on pests that gather 
in great numbers masking the scent and research and development 
has run into regulatory roadblocks and apathy 
dennehy and roelofs spent nearly two years getting a permit for 
a largescale test they had to learn legal jargon to explain what 
they wanted to do track down the right forms and present pages of 
evidence and documentation required by the federal insecticide 
fungicide and rodenticide act 
our problem is that we have a nontoxic chemical being watched 
over by regulations for toxic chemicals said roelofs who works 
with dennehy at the new york agricultural experiment station of 
cornell university 
touhey senior agricultural adviser to the epa office of 
pesticide programs said it seems the traditional mechanisms 
that were working in the past to regulate things doesnt seem to be 
working now 
in dennehys experiment male moths attracted to clear plastic 
twistties laced with the pheromone have trouble finding fertile 
females thus preventing explosive growth of the bugs in the 
vineyard 
he had sought a permit letting him use pheromones which have a 
chemical makeup similar to olive oil and sell the grapes epa 
said ok but only if he destroyed the grapes costing him 10000 
he might have earned 
then it said he could sell them 
dennehy expects to have results from his tests in 100 acres of 
grapes across new york after the harvest if they are favorable 
the next step will be to get the pheromone on the market 
dave ross who grows 275 acres of grapes in westfield near lake 
erie said he would welcome a chance to stop using the pesticide 
parathion any time we can eliminate using something that 
dangerous i think its a good thing 
under current rules however the epa requires a study to 
determine environmental impact of the pesticide that includes 
feeding it to ducks and shellfish and could cost millions dennehy 
said 
both touhey and ridgway believe a compromise can be reached that 
will make it easier for pheromones to reach farmers and growers 
in some cases tests could be waived touhey said in others 
the number of tests could be cut meanwhile hes trying to help 
pheromone researchers get certain permits and guide them through 
the regulatory maze 
and while theoretically oreo cookies and milk used to control 
or mitigate insects would be pesticides realistically the morass 
of regulations includes a waiver of tests he said but i get the 
point

a drug long used to free dogs of heartworms also 
apparently prevents a serious parasitic disease among visitors to 
some parts of africa 
an estimated 13 million people in western and central africa are 
infected with loa loa the african eyeworm but loiasis the 
disease it causes is usually most severe among outsiders who visit 
africa 
the worm is spread by biting flies that feed on human blood and 
is parasitic in or just under the skin often migrating to around 
the eyes 
the heartworm drug diethylcarbamazine kills the worm before 
the body mounts a strong immune response to it the major 
consequences of the disease including possible heart and kidney 
damage result from the bodys immune reaction to the worm 
doctors from the national institute of allergy and infectious 
diseases tested diethylcarbamazine on peace corps volunteers in 
gabon cameroon and the central african republic fortyone took 
weekly doses of the medicine for two years while 60 others took 
placebo pills six in the placebo group got loiasis but none of 
the diethylcarbamazine users got sick 
while the drug is considered safe the doctors said it is not 
necessary for people who make brief visits to major cities in the 
region 
the research team headed by dr thomas b nutman reported 
their findings recently in the new england journal of medicine

an archaeologist who cut himself 20 years 
ago on a 3500yearold obsidian blade thinks the mayans had the 
right idea 
payson sheets says obsidian blades can be 500 times sharper than 
steel resulting in more exact cuts that heal quicker and with less 
scarring he and ophthalmologist firmon hardenbergh are seeking 
food and drug administration permission to make and sell glass and 
obsidian surgical blades 
obsidian formed when lava cools too quickly to crystallize was 
traded throughout the americas by indians as tool material unlike 
steel sheets says the black glassy material can be fractured to 
a few molecules thick 
hardenbergh uses the blades in cornea transplants and cataract 
surgery and the partners have loaned obsidian and glass blades to 
other surgeons while they await fda approval sheets says that 
process could take more than a year 
sheets also is experimenting by mixing a hardening agent into 
molten glass so blades will hold a tougher and more consistent 
edge he pours the molten glass into molds to make blades of

anyone nervous about the effects of wind 
or earthquakes on the university of tennessees planned engineering 
building will have only to go down to the lobby and see what the 
building says 
instruments planted throughout the building when it is built 
beginning next summer will measure those forces and display them 
and the movements of machines and people on a computergenerated 
graphic display 
we will put transducers in the beams and columns to measure 
varying loads and how the building responds to those loads said 
richard bennett associate professor of civil engineering 
instruments that measure wind pressure will be installed so we 
can determine how the building is affected by wind and how the 
real responses compare to the formulas we now use to design 
buildings 
it will be a working laboratory we will be able to make 
precise measurements of forces that before could only be 
estimated 
the building can be used to demonstrate engineering mechanics 
principles and as a research tool to learn more about design and 
construction and the longterm behavior of people bennett said

a nevada company selling a home radiation 
detector like a smoke detector acknowledges it wont go off until 
exposure levels reach five times the minimum standards set by the 
government and safety officials question other company claims 
over a hundred nuclear power plants are a prime source of 
peril for some 30 million households situated nearby said jack 
little president of unique products inc of reno in an accident 
he said people should get out fast 
were not merchants of fear on the contrary we want people 
to understand that a nuclear mishap is not like exploding a nuclear 
bomb people can protect themselves little said 
the earlywarning radiation detector sounds an alarm at about 
five times the minimum government standard for exposure of nuclear 
plant workers little said such standards are a matter of 
scientific controversy 
a sixpage manual advises that when an alarm sounds people 
should stay calm gather essentials lock their homes and head away 
from the radiation source without speeding every few miles they 
should check the detector when it no longer sounds then you 
know you have reached safety 
if the alarm sounds at a higher setting than the minimum you 
need to change directions 
nuclear regulatory commission spokesman jan strasma said more 
than a soundandlight alarm would be needed to decide how to 
handle a radiation emergency 
evacuation is not always the answer strasma said because a 
building may provide protection the answer to dealing with a 
nuclear accident is to follow the emergency plan and the advice of 
state and local officials 
little pointed out that the nrc acknowledges nearly 3000 
accidents occur every year at us power plants 
strasma said that number refers to situations that include minor 
procedural infractions and called littles wording a vast 
overstatement 
nonetheless nrc spokesman russ marabito said he could foresee 
no agency action to counteract any statements used in selling the 
device if he feels its correct thats between him and the 
buyer marabito said 
little had no sales information on the device which he said was 
testmarketed in california he said us and european distribution 
began after the national hardware show here in august

a new longterm way of dealing with the third 
worlds crippling 12 trillion debt may be foreshadowed by 700 
million worth of new loans the world bank is offering to argentina 
on the surface argentina seems a poor prospect for more loans 
it already owes more than 49 billion the biggest debt of any 
third world country after brazil and mexico 
it should be paying 45 billion this year in interest alone 
and already is about 1 billion behind in its payments with 
interest rates rising the bill may be 1 billion higher next year 
the financial world is so skeptical about the prospects for 
repayment that argentine loans can be bought for less than 22 cents 
on the dollar 
finance minister juan sourrouille says he hopes to pay half the 
interest out of the countrys own earnings the rest he will have 
to borrow presumably from many of the same banks that lent the 
original money 
president raul alfonsins government the first one freely 
elected after years of military rule faces an election in 1989 
many of his opponents who are given an excellent chance to succeed 
him are talking about suspending interest payments altogether 
yet the 151 governments in the world bank probably will approve 
the new loans next month the banks sister organization the 
international monetary fund has been negotiating all summer with 
the argentine government to make another 12 billion in loans 
sourrouille says negotiations should be completed in a couple of 
weeks and he then will know how much to ask from the commercial 
banks probably more than 1 billion 
why all this new lending it has a lot to do with an old 
bankers saying 
lend a man a thousand dollars and hes in your power lend him 
a million and youre in his 
the lenders keep on lending in the hope that argentina and the 
other big debtors will use the money wisely investing in new 
factories and farm equipment so they can earn more money from their 
exports and catch up with their bills its called growing out of 
financial difficulties 
the lenders all represented at the current fund and bank 
meetings in berlin see no other choice the fund says the strategy 
is working well and that the debtors exports are growing faster 
than their debts 
new loans are given under conditions usually tied to economic 
policies if the borrower fails to meet them the disbursements are 
cut off 
traditionally the imf has taken the lead in setting the 
conditions providing a seal of approval for other creditors 
but the fund was set up originally to deal with shortterm currency 
problems the world bank is intended to aid longterm development 
of poor countries 
argentina is considered a middleincome country with 
individual earnings averaging 2370 a year compared with 120 in 
ethiopia and 21250 in switzerland 
but argentina has fallen on hard times and incomes have been 
declining through the 1980s so the country is considered a 
candidate for basic improvements 
now for the first time the world bank has taken the lead in 
setting conditions and many of them are conditions on longterm 
policy of a kind that the imf would not require 
sourrouille not only has promised to cut government spending 
sharply but also is undertaking other changes basic to his 
countrys economy 
he has promised the world bank he will strengthen the tax 
administration reducing tax evasion and improving collections he 
is attempting to improve the bank system making the major public 
banks selfsustaining rather than dependent on government 
subsidies and has promised new policies on trade and industry 
there has been some grumbling nigel lawson the british 
chancellor of the exchequer has warned against easing the 
conditions for loans 
the world bank accord with argentina reportedly made some imf 
people furious but michel camdessus the imf managing director 
welcomed the agreement publicly 
argentina and the fund are expected to agree on further 
conditions commercial banks presumably will come in with their 
loans including new money for investment in argentina the hope is 
that the new policies will put the country back on the road to the 
kind of prosperity it enjoyed before world war ii 
if they do the new leadership by the world bank may furnish a 
model for other countries in longterm trouble

economists of major us companies are predicting the economy 
will slow in 1989 
a panel of 60 economists from the national association of 
business economists on monday made a median forecast of 23 percent 
growth next year substantially less than the reagan 
administrations forecast of 31 percent 
nearly half of the economists 47 percent said in a survey in 
late august and early september that they expected the country to 
topple into a recession by the end of next year 
another 42 percent believe a recession will occur in 1990 only 
11 percent believe the 6yearold economic expansion will continue 
into 1991 or later 
separately a trade group reported that sales of existing 
singlefamily homes increased a modest 11 percent in august as 
buyers tried to close purchases before interest rates rose further 
also monday senate democrats gave up on trying to raise the 
minimum wage and their staff issued a report charging the economy 
was producing mainly lowwage jobs 
the home sales report by the national association of realtors 
said sales of existing homes rose after a sharp 50 percent decline 
in july 
john savacool an economist with wefa group a bala cynwyd pa 
economic forecasting firm said buyers completing sales in august 
probably began looking for homes in may and june 
that was just after rates started rising he said the 
increase was a mild panic response to rising rates 
in washington senate democrats said a fiveday republican 
filibuster effectively had killed chances of raising the 
335anhour minimum wage this year 
there is no point in our continuing to pound on their door 
said senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva im now 
conceding that the republican filibuster was successful 
the democratic staff of the senate budget committee said in its 
wage report that the proportions of both highpaying and lowpaying 
jobs have grown in the 1980s 
the report added fuel to an electionyear debate over the 
quality of the 16 million new jobs added since president reagan 
took office in 1981 
the report said slightly more than 50 percent of the net 
increase in new jobs since 1979 paid a yearround fulltime 
equivalent less than 11611 while 12 percent of them paid more 
than 46444 
many of the lowwage jobs were held by people who were not the 
primary wage earners in their families 
sen pete v domenici of new mexico the committees ranking 
republican and former chairman called the report opportunistic 
and political

the new york stock exchange hopes its postcrash 
reform package announced earlier this year will receive government 
approval by the anniversary of the oct 19 market rout but federal 
regulators arent making promises 
donald solodar senior vice president of the largest us stock 
market said monday the securities and exchange commission actively 
was reviewing the reform proposals devised jointly with the 
chicago mercantile exchange 
the reforms would supercede the nyses temporary collar 
restraint on computerized program trading a sixmonth experiment 
approved by the sec last april 20 that was aimed at calming wild 
price swings the collar expires oct 19 the anniversary of the 
crash 
speaking to reporters at an nyse briefing about steps taken to 
improve the climate for stock trading since the crash solodar said 
it was possible the new reforms would not be in place by the 
anniversary but we believe the sec will approve them 
in washington sec officials declined to specify when the 
reforms would be approved they were announced in july but not 
filed with the regulatory agency until late august 
the staff is actively reviewing these matters and is trying to 
expedite its review consistent with the nyse request said 
brendon becker sec associate director of market regulation 
market regulatory officials have said privately that potential 
complications have arisen because other us securities markets 
dislike the proposed reforms for example the national association 
of securities dealers which supervises overthecounter trading 
has expressed opposition to them 
under the reforms the new york and chicago markets agreed on a 
oneyear pilot program for what they called coordinated circuit 
breakers that would halt trading temporarily if price moves 
exceeded preset limits 
the halts would be triggered in new york by a 250point move in 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks and in chicago by a 
12point move in the standard amp poors 500 stockindex futures 
contract 
the reforms also call for tighter communication between the 
chicago and new york exchanges and a common policy on intermarket 
frontrunning an abuse in which traders are able to take a 
profitable position in one market based on what they know will 
happen in another market 
the nyse also has prepared what it calls an individual 
investor express delivery service which will provide 
transmission priority to individual investor orders when the dow 
average moves 25 points from its previous close 
this reform was designed to reassure investors that their orders 
will receive equal treatment with those from large institutional 
investors on black monday many individuals complained they could 
not sell their stock because larger investors were served first 
nyse officials conceded at the monday briefing that individual 
investors remain unwilling to reenter the stock market which has 
failed to recoup much of the loss from the crash and has been 
plagued by low trading volume 
asked to speculate when individuals would regain the confidence 
to invest in stocks nyse president richard grasso said that is 
beyond my crystal ball at the moment 
a bleak assessment of when individual investor confidence also 
was offered monday in a postcrash review by edward i obrien 
president of the securities industry assocation a leading wall 
street trade group 
obrien said in a statement that although the worst fears about 
the economy never materialized after the collapse and market 
conditions have improved in some areas the overall current 
environment is at best gray 
he said the sia believes the nearterm outlook isnt likely to 
improve substantially until full investor confidence is restored in 
both the integrity of the marketplace and the strength of the 
economy 
obrien also said there have been a few steps to correct 
problems exposed as a result of the crash but major regulatory 
reform hasnt taken place

opecs president says the cartels attempts 
to restore production discipline among its members are unlikely to 
produce any startling breakthroughs but could mark the start of 
the groups climb back to its former authority in the world oil 
market 
in an interview with the associated press opec president 
rilwanu lukman also said the cartels decision to review crude oil 
price and production objectives was part of a methodical process 
aimed at achieving unity among its members and shoring up prices 
now the time has come to sit down and say okay this is what 
we want this is how were going to do it lets go ahead an do 
it lukman said in an interview at the end of a twoday 
extraordinary meeting here of opecs fivemember price monitoring 
committee 
the pricing committee announced monday it had called for a joint 
meeting with the fivemember long term strategy committee 
lukman said the move would bring together key members of 
organization of petroleum exporting countries to see if we can 
come up with something we can sell to the organization as a whole 
the pricing committee issued a communique that said it is 
essential that opec review its objectives and strategies in the 
context of current circumstances for the short medium and the long 
terms especially concerning the price of oil and the production 
mechanism to support it in the light of the expressed positions of 
member countries 
opec has attempted to maintain a world crude oil price of 18 a 
barrel by restricting the output of its members 
but internal dissension that worsened during the eightyear war 
between iran and iraq two founding members of opec has led to 
overproduction and a world oil glut that has depressed crude prices 
to their lowest levels in two years 
the parisbased international energy energy agency reported opec 
production at 19 million barrels a day in august and lukman has put 
opec production at closer to 20 million barrels per day 
last june opec set a 1506 million barrel a day ceiling to 
apply to all opec nations except iraq which contended it needed 
the to produce more oil to help rebuild its wartorn economy 
on monday north sea brent crude for delivery in october was 
quoted at 1325 up slightly from friday 
the signing of an iraniraq ceasefire in august apparently 
opened a door of opportunity for the start of a slow but deep 
review of opecs strategies and targets regarding pricing and 
production policies 
iran and iraq are members of the long term strategy committee 
others include saudia arabia kuwait and venezuela the pricing 
committee comprises the oil ministers of nigeria saudi arabia 
algeria indonesia and venezuela 
referring to iran and iraq at a press conference monday in 
madrid opec secretary general subroto of indonesia said both 
countries indicated they would participate in the joint committee 
meeting set for next month at an undisclosed location subroto said 
it would be the first time in years that iran and iraq engaged in 
direct talks within opec 
opec officials said the decision to call a joint meeting of the 
pricing and long term strategy committees before any extraordinary 
session of all opec ministers was part of a negotiating process 
that was arranged at the previous price monitoring committee 
meeting aug 3 in lausanne switzerland 
after that meeting subroto was asked to visit various opec 
countries to discuss possibilities and ideas that could smooth over 
differences within the cartel the officials said 
all these meetings are part of a decisionmaking process 
lukman said 
but he emphasized the slow steady pace toward more unity could 
not be expected to bring about startling breakthroughs lukman said 
no opec officials believe the first joint committee meeting will 
produce a new benchmark price or quotas 
im not trying to belittle the importance of the joint 
meeting we could come up with something which is big lukman 
said 
all the major actors will be there he said at the end of 
the day well get something 
speaking of iraq lukman said nobody should be allowed to act 
unilaterally anymore whether we have a quota or we dont have a 
quota we must sit down and agree on what to do

kroger co expects to raise 333 million after 
taxes from the sale of stores and food processing plants under a 
massive restructuring aimed at thwarting two takeover bids 
the 46 billion restructuring will leave kroger shareholders 
with continuing interest in the company and will be more lucrative 
than the unsolicited purchase offers by dart group corp the 
investment firm kohlberg kravis roberts amp co kroger officials 
said monday in outlining the plan 
kroger chairman lyle everingham and president joseph pichler 
said the restructuring also would turn kroger the nations largest 
supermarket operator into a smaller albeit highly leveraged 
company 
krogers board of directors rejected as inadequate both the 46 
billion cash and securities offer by new yorkbased kohlberg kravis 
and the rival 432 billion bid by dart of landover md 
the board also was advised there could be antitrust problems 
with the offer from kohlberg kravis which recently outbid dart for 
the safeway and stop amp shop grocery chains 
kroger stock rose 62 cents to close at 5637 a share in new 
york stock exchange trading monday 
the restructuring which will be krogers second since 1986 is 
worth 57 to 61 per share officials said 
krogers plan which was publicly proposed sept 13 would pay 
company shareholders 40 a share in cash plus securities valued at 
8 and publicly traded stock worth between 5 and 10 
the company will net about 333 million from the sale of assets 
and will lay off workers at its cincinnati headquarters 
everingham declined to tell reporters which food processing 
plants will be sold or how many headquarters employees would be 
laid off those layoffs will be in addition to a costcutting 
program already under way to reduce headquarters employment through 
attrition everingham said 
kroger said it had commitments for 36 billion in bank 
financing for the restructuring from a group led by new yorks 
citibank and chemical bank and first national bank of chicago 
spokesmen for dart and kohlberg kravis declined comment monday 
kroger said it would sell some of its food processing facilities 
nationwide its 27supermarket frys of california division in 
northern california its sixunit welcome inc superwarehouse 
venture in greenville sc jacksonville fla mobile ala and 
richmond va and its 29 supermarkets in charlotte nc and 
charleston sc 
kroger also said it would sell its 16unit price savers 
wholesale warehouse inc to a managementled investment group 
would continue the sale of its florida choice division and would 
and then lease back krogerowned stores and real estate in texas 
it will continue its texas retail operations in that state and will 
sell its general merchandise distribution center in san marcos 
texas 
the 105yearold company announced friday that it intended to go 
ahead with the restructuring despite competing offers by dart and 
kohlberg kravis the haft family which controls dart triggered 
the competition when federal regulators announced this month that 
they had given the hafts clearance to buy at least 15 million 
worth of kroger stock 
dart a retailing company which has been involved in a number of 
unsuccessful but profitable takeover bids in recent years offered 
a week ago to buy kroger for 55 a share in cash and securities for 
each of krogers 786 million outstanding shares 
kohlberg kravis entered the bidding tuesday with an offer to buy 
kroger for 5850 in cash and securities in a leveraged buyout 
kroger operates more than 1300 supermarkets 935 convenience 
stores and 15 membership warehouses in 29 states the company also 
processes food products for sale in its stores and to outside 
customers 
kohlberg kravis won a hostile takeover battle for beatrice cos 
in which the haft family was a bidder in 1985 and outbid the hafts 
for safeway in 1986 and stop amp shop earlier this year 
dart owns the crown books and trak auto stores chains

the american bankers association says 
changing tax laws are prompting more consumers to pay their credit 
card balances in full each month 
a new survey by the industry trade group indicates 40 percent of 
consumers pay their monthly card bills in full up from about 33 
percent last year 
david hunt vice chairman of abas retail electronic services 
and bank card division said the increase stemmed from the federal 
tax law which is phasing out credit card interest deductions over 
a fouryear period ending in 1991 
the study released monday also found that overall growth in 
the bank credit card business had slowed because of stiff 
competition from other issuers such as sears and american express 
the survey results reflect the fierce competition among bank 
card issuers said hunt the range of prices and card features 
gives consumers a virtually unlimited number of options 
the number of visa and mastercard cardholders grew by about 9 
percent last year a slowdown in the rate of previous years 
according to hunt visa and mastercard both bankowned credit card 
associations represent 60 percent of the bank credit card market 
weve seen the entrance of significant new competition over 
the last couple of years said hunt who also is executive vice 
president of signet banking corp richmond va 
the report found consumers charged more than 165 billion on 
their bank cards last year an increase of 188 percent for 
mastercard and 123 percent for visa 
the aba report was based on a survey of 1444 cardissuing banks 
selected from a national sample based on asset size and includes 
1987 and first quarter 1988 data on bank card interest rates fees 
marketing and operations 
the number of banks charging the maximum interest rate allowed 
in their states declined to less than onefourth according to 
hunt who attributed the drop to increased market competition 
banks that charged the maximum rate included 18 percent of banks 
with assets under 300 million and 27 percent of large banks with 
assets above 1 billion the report said 
in comparison last years report found that 35 percent of the 
large banks with assets above 1 billion charged the maximum 
rate that report also showed that about 26 percent of banks with 
assets below 500 million charged the highest rate allowed in their 
states 
the aba is the national trade and professional association for 
us full service banks of all sizes the bank card conference runs 
through wednesday

general motors acceptance corp is planning waves 
of publicity for its new car and truck leasing incentives but its 
big three competitors say the offerings are nothing new 
gmac the finance arm of the worlds largest manufacturer said 
monday its smartlease program can save customers money on 
monthly payments and tell them in advance how much it will cost to 
buy the car at the end of the lease 
the most popular cars gm makes are included in the program but 
gmac offered neither a range of savings nor specific examples of 
savings on any models 
the finance divisions of ford motor co and chrysler corp said 
they have offered similar deals for most of the decade 
we have had a consumer leasing program that has been promoted 
extensively ford motor credit co spokeswoman joy wolfe said 
we feel that we have been a leader in consumer leasing 
clifford damaska ford retail lease manager said the company 
has offered a variety of incentives over the last 18 months while 
competing with the special interest rates and cash rebates offered 
to retail buyers 
chrysler financial corp spokesman robert heath said the no 3 
carmakers gold key lease finance plan offers the same features as 
gmacs 
heath said chrysler dealers work out the final postlease 
purchase price with the customer 
included in the gmac promotion which runs through dec 31 are 
the chevrolet corsica and beretta the pontiac grand am three 
cutlass models and two gmc truck lines company spokesman john 
andrews said 
what weve done is a corporatewide program andrews said 
leasing programs have been done by each of the divisions under 
our old programs the purchase price was determined at the end of 
lease and was the fair market value of the car 
knowing the postlease or residual value of the car up front is 
an advantage to the buyer in considering whether to buy out the 
lease at its end andrews said 
the end of auto interest deductions on federal tax returns has 
made leasing a more attractive option especially for young 
families trying to meet mortgage payments which still are partly 
tax deductible he said 
its also a lifestyle thing andrews said it isnt 
important for people to own things like it used to be 
national promotion of the smartlease program began during sunday 
nights telecast of the summer olympics extensive electronic and 
print ads are planned

high technology and the reagan administrations 
defense buildup are responsible for the economic vitality of states 
that top a new survey of job and business creation economists say 
inc magazines annual report on the states gave arizona new 
hampshire and maryland the best track record for creating new jobs 
and businesses and stimulating growth of young companies in the 
last four years 
a lot of these states are where they are because of what has 
happened in the last four to six years in the federal defense 
buildup said stanley duobinis director of regional economic 
forecasting for the wefa group in suburban philadelphia 
many new electronics firms concentrated in phoenix have defense 
contracts no 5 virginia boasts the pentagon and naval shipyards 
in newport news maryland where bethlehem steel once was the 
largest employer now hosts companies such as westinghouse and 
bendix defense systems 
youll find a lot of those electronics firms are indeed in 
that san diego out to phoenix area duobinis said a lot of 
that has been defense stimulated 
the inc survey concludes the south and southwest are thriving 
but notes that some industrial states are making a comeback partly 
due to programs that use small amounts of tax dollars to foster 
private growth 
independent business analysts said the desert belt of arizona 
and california and the rest of the south continue to benefit from 
lower wages warm climate and defense growth 
the states in the south and some in the southwest have in fact 
lower wages and do attract business and continue to expand based on 
their lower cost of doing business said lew hurt regional group 
associate director for data resources the lexingtonbased economic 
forecasting firm 
the inc survey measures how a state has done in stimulating 
entrepreneurial activity and economic expansion it reflects the 
state economies successes over a fouryear period in job 
generation newbusiness creation and youngcompany growth 
for example arizona earned its third consecutive top ranking 
with 231 percent job growth since 1984 and 1769 new companies 
with at least 10 employees for a 287 percent business birthrate 
while 4 percent of companies founded since 1980 were rated 
fastgrowing 
wyoming last for the second straight year lost 109 percent of 
its jobs had a 08 percent business birthrate and a 097 percent 
rate of growing businesses 
some notable changes include texas which slipped from 12th to 
20th with a job growth of just 29 percent due to the slumping oil 
industry 
economists said the decline in the value of the dollar and 
improving foreign trade figures have been major reasons for 
economic optimism in the slumping industrial midwest 
in the inc survey michigan indiana and ohio nos 23 24 25 
each showed job growth of over 107 percent since 1984 and 
economists said most of it has come in the last two years 
pennsylvania rose to 28th from 32nd with a strong 32 percent small 
company growth rate 
theyve been down so long that theres only one way to really 
to go and thats up hurt said 
michigan was cited for using small amounts of public money to 
create incentives for larger private investment inc said ohio now 
offers matching grants to promising new companies while indiana 
offers tax credits to citizens who invest in a venture capital fund 
to support businesses 
hightech industry spinoffs from california and massachusetts

a dissident shareholder group trying to 
sell zenith electronics corp says it was pleased the board of 
directors will allow a vote on the plan but that it still lacks 
important company data 
zeniths board of directors amended the companys bylaws monday 
so that new yorkbased brookhurst partners plan to sell the 
company would require approval by a simple majority of shareholders 
before the action company bylaws would have required unanimous 
consent from shareholders a provision contested in court by 
brookhurst 
brookhurst spokesman tom franco said the revison was a positive 
step but his group needed to see zeniths financial records and a 
list of company stockholders 
its hard for us to make any qualitative statement on the 
action by the board of directors today franco said in a 
telephone interview monday we look forward to bringing our case 
to the shareowners but we are still waiting for the owners list 
zenith stock fell 25 cents a share to 1975 monday in new york 
stock exchange trading 
zenith chairman jerry k pearlman said in a statement that his 
company revised the bylaw so shareholders will not be distracted 
from the key issue of who is best qualified to direct the future of 
this company zeniths present board or brookhurst partners 
zenith spokesman john taylor refused to elaborate on pearlmans 
statement citing securities and exchange commission regulations 
or to say whether zenith had made any recommendation to 
shareholders on the brookhurst offer 
zenith the last remaining us television manufacturer has 
lost millions in recent years struggling to compete with lowcost 
imported electronic goods 
last year the company posted a loss of 191 million on sales 
of 236 billion 
brookhurst which owns 61 percent of zeniths outstanding 
common shares bought into the company in june with the intention 
of selling the television and computer maker franco said 
but franco said his group formed by herbert abelow and nicholas 
ihasz would be open to a realistic management plan to achieve 
profitability

the chicago mercantile exchange and the nations 
largest options clearing house have reached an agreement on new 
rules to ease the strain on the system caused by heavy trading 
officials said 
the agreement between the merc and chicagobased options 
clearing corp announced monday calls for crossmargining on 
certain stock index futures and options accounts 
margins are deposits paid by traders to cover the risk of daily 
losses cross margining allows traders to have credit for trading 
positions that reduce their risk of loss 
under the plan traders who have protected their positions by 
hedging in both markets would have to put up less money for their 
margins 
the practice was recommended by a presidential commission that 
investigated last octobers stock market crash and must be approved 
by the securities and exchange commission and the commodities 
futures trading commission 
officials from the mercantile exchange and options clearing the 
nations largest options clearing house have been working on the 
crossmargining program for about a year 
had crossmargining been permitted during the huge decline in 
the stock market on oct 19 it would have reduced the strain on 
the nations financial system and eased demands for cash on several 
major banks that ran into billions of dollars a day

fresh from losing a bruising fight to raise 
the minimum wage senate democrats marched back onto the 
battlefield with an equally controversial proposal requiring 
jobprotected medical and parental leaves for workers 
what a profound and strong signal it would be to approve 
such a requirement sen christopher dodd dconn said monday in 
opening debate on the measure it would be catching up with the 
needs of people in this country 
dodds bill would guarantee at least 13 weeks of unpaid 
jobprotected leave to seriously ill workers and at least 10 weeks 
to those with newborn newly adopted or seriously ill children 
businesses of under 20 employees would be exempt 
sen dale bumpers dark planned to offer a substitute 
reducing the medical leave length to 10 weeks but it was unclear 
whether such a change would attract the 60 votes necessary to cut 
off debate 
conservatives and many in the business community contend the 
government should not mandate benefits 
i am concerned that this legislation may impede the trend 
now developing in the workplace where employees are able to choose 
from a variety of benefits said sen strom thurmond rsc 
he and others also say any leave requirement would be an 
economic hardship on small businesses but sen edward kennedy 
dmass chairman of the labor and human resources committee said 
congress watchdog agency the general accounting office has 
estimated the bill would cost employers 350 per worker per year 
a penny a day so that working parents wont lose their jobs 
when they care for a newborn when they must care for a 
seriously ill child kennedy said i put the choice to the 
opponents of this bill can you spare a penny a day for these 
children or is this economic expansion so fragile that a penny a 
day will do us in 
kennedy said he had received three veto letters from the reagan 
administration on the family leave bill 
dodd appealed monday for bipartisan support from his colleagues 
and from vice president george bush the republican presidential 
nominee massachusetts gov michael dukakis the democratic 
presidential nominee already has endorsed the dodd approach 
bush has said women shouldnt have to worry about getting their 
jobs back after a maternity leave but has not issued a detailed 
proposal he is said to favor a voluntary approach involving tax 
breaks for businesses that offer jobprotected leaves sen dan 
quayle rind the gop vice presidential nominee opposed the dodd 
bill in committee 
senate work on the parental leave bill came as the chambers 
democratic leaders on monday gave up all hope of passing 
legislation to increase the minimum wage this year conceding 
defeat to a republican filibuster

oil futures prices plunged to near twoyear lows 
for the second time this month as fears of a worsening oil glut 
spread through the market 
analysts said rumors that saudi arabia opecs largest producer 
was continuing its discount strategy to boost market share in the 
wake of the cartels price meeting sent the market into a tailspin 
on the new york mercantile exchange the november contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark us crude oil was trading 
as much as 35 cents lower between 1385 and 1402 a barrel 
compared with mondays closing price of 1420 
todays rumors were that the saudis were offering discounts to 
the japanese said peter beutel an analyst with elders futures inc 
but other opec nations including the united arab emirates 
kuwait and iraq also are reported to be producing far in excess of 
their assigned quotas 
it seems as if theres been a complete breakdown with the 
arabs leading the charge toward market share beutel said 
the fall in crude prices pulled down oil product prices 
wholesale unleaded gasoline for october delivery was trading 
between 4450 and 4490 cents a gallon down from its close of 
4525 cents a gallon on monday 
and october wholesale heating oil had lost 113 cents before 
midday to 3910 cents a gallon from mondays settlement price of 
4023 a gallon 
the longanticipated meeting of the organization of petroleum 
exporting countries price committee adjourned monday after two 
days of talks with no concrete steps announced for dealing with the 
world oversupply of oil or weakening oil prices 
on monday confusion and uncertainty over opecs intentions 
caused wild gyrations in prices and trading activity analysts said 
rumors went both ways but there were points where buying 
completely dried up then came back beutel said 
energy futures prices opened higher then tumbled after 
statements by opec secretary general subroto that the pricing 
committee had adjourned without calling for a full meeting of the 
cartel to deal with the problems of excess oil production and 
sagging prices 
instead subroto said the pricing committee and opecs longterm 
strategy committee would meet jointly next month to review supply 
and demand problems 
analysts said the marketplace interpreted the statements as an 
indication the cartel was unwilling to cut production 
the marketplace was disappointed in the committees failure to 
come up with a concrete direction said john azarow shearson

in chicago with the gh miller division of the britishowned 
trading company lit america inc 
soybean futures registered their lowest daily settlement price 
in nearly four months monday 806 a bushel for november delivery

support for corn and soybean futures this morning but wheat 
remained weak due to slack export demand gidel said

is increasing the amount of available corn and soybeans 
the agriculture department reported monday that corn harvesting 
was 20 percent complete and soybean harvesting was 14 percent 
finished as of sunday

bond prices were mixed in subdued trading early 
today with little new economic data to move the market 
the treasurys closely watched 30year issue was up 332 point 
or about 90 cents for every 1000 in face value 
its yield which moves inversely to its price and is often an 
indicator of interest rate trends slipped to 907 percent from 
908 percent late monday 
analysts said the market had not responded to an early drop in 
oil prices which usually is favorable to bonds because it signals 
an easing of inflationary pressures 
the dollar also appeared stable after waffling on monday and 
closing higher against most major currencies 
it seems the bond market doesnt want to do anything until 
we get more information said elizabeth reiners vice president 
of moneymarket research for dean witter reynolds inc 
analysts said bond investors are already looking to next weeks 
us unemployment report for a clearer indication of the economys 
direction unemployment rose slightly last month which many 
interpreted as a sign the economy is slowing 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues were down 132 point intermediate maturities 
were 132 point higher to 132 point lower and 20year issues were 
116 point lower according to telerate inc a financial 
information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman hutton daily treasury bond index which 
measures price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with 
maturities of a year or longer was down 016 at 114047

hyster co contends that its japanese 
competitors now are dumping forklift parts in the united states 
in an effort to evade new us customs duties imposed on them for 
selling complete forklifts below cost 
after a yearlong battle by hyster the us government decided 
last spring to impose customs duties ranging as high as 50 percent 
on the imports 
the company now alleges that the japanese are trying to 
circumvent those duties by importing the vehicles in pieces and 
assembling them in the united states 
hyster officials say they have collected data that show imports 
of forklift parts have nearly doubled this year compared to last 
year 
in a letter to department of commerce and us customs service 
administrators hyster notes us statistics list truck part 
imports at 167 million in the first six months of 1987 this year 
those imports jumped to 349 million 
the company asks the government to determine whether trucks 
assembled in the united states also should be subject to the duties 
hyster notes in its letter that the new trade law allows federal 
officials to assess duties against companies that simply switch 
from dumping finished products to dumping parts which then are 
assembled in the united states or in a third country 
in a similar case involving dumping televisions in the united 
states by south koreans the government decided imported parts that 
were assembled in the united states also were subject to dumping 
duties

one of the most thankless and unrewarding 
positions to be in today is that of the financial adviser waiting 
for the recession 
its been a very long wait for some of them and a very costly 
experience for their customers one of the breed for example 
advised his clients to get out of the stock market back in 1982 
just before the bull charged 
while his clients thus lost out on some fantastic gains the 
investment adviser celebrated on oct 19 1987 the day of the big 
stock market crash believing his views were vindicated and his 
long wait made worthwhile 
reinvigorated his company then made the scenario even more 
bleak and black warning that interest rates would soar major 
banks would collapse production would cease and a pall would 
descend over economic america 
but it didnt happen instead of falling into line with his 
dictates and the pronouncements of his brethren the us economy 
has grown sturdier since last year and even dedicated doomsayers 
now are losing their patience 
what had sustained many of them through their long barren wait 
was the near certainty that economic expansions have limited lives 
that the very existence of an expansion was reason enough to 
forecast a recession 
each month therefore their conviction grew stronger but 
unfortunately so did the stability of the economy and now in 
spite of it nearing age 71 months the economy is producing great 
doubts about the recession scenario 
sam nagakama a widely followed business economist is among 
those who have recently expressed the notion that perhaps the 
country already has worked its way through a problem period and may 
be ready for renewed expansion 
broadly speaking this is a thesis put forward by economists 
such as edward yardeni of prudentialbache securities inc and 
albert sindlinger of sindlinger amp co among others but nakagama 
gives it his own particular touch 
as he views events the oil price decline and the dollars 
depreciation helped the economy avoid recession in mid1986 while 
at the same time setting in motion a new cyclical expansion 
he states that the oil price decline helped support consumer 
demand while dollar depreciation fueled an exportcumcapital 
spending boom thus he suggests no early recession is likely 
even if the cycle is nearly 71 months old 
sindlinger went on record back in late 1986 with an argument 
that at least 31 states were in recession no matter what the 
national statistics showed from that point on he states the 
economy has become much stronger 
yardeni who has challenged the conventional thinking at every 
opportunity in the past year provides an insight into how the 
economy can continue to grow while in the view of many it is at 
the limit of its capacity 
first he describes two scenarios that are held dear by the 
end of cycle crowd 
1 if the economy continues to grow odds are that unemployment 
will fall below 5 percent labor shortages will boost wage 
inflation higher inflation will push interest rates to levels that 
ultimately trigger recession 
2 if the economy continues to grow capacity utilization rates 
will rise and so will prices again higher inflation will push 
interest rates to levels that ultimately trigger recession 
but he asks what if business responds to the labor shortage 
and capacity restraints by increasing laborsaving 
productivityenhancing capital outlays 
then capacity will expand and output can grow faster than 
employment wages will rise in this growthisgood extendedcycle 
scenario he explains 
however he continues the wage increases will be in line with 
productivity gains so unit labor costs wont put upward pressure 
on prices or downward pressure on profits 
can it happen yardeni says he believes it can and that it may 
already be happening in nondurable goods manufacturing

federal investigators said today the pilot of 
the continental airlines jet that crashed last november in a 
snowstorm in denver had a history of training problems and little 
experience flying jet aircraft 
the experience of the cockpit crew of continental flight 1713 
was a key focus of the national transportation safety boards 
nearly yearlong investigation of the crash last nov 15 in which 
28 of the 82 people aboard were killed 
as the safety board prepared its final report of the accident 
its staff of investigators made clear at a hearing that pilot 
experience and questions about whether the aircraft took off with 
ice on the wings were central factors in the accident 
investigators said first officer lee bruecher 26 the planes 
second in command who was at the controls of the mcdonnell douglas 
dc9 as it took off had numerous training problems dating back to 
1983 
he had failed initial tests for his multiengine license and was 
fired by a small air taxi operator in 1985 because of handling 
problems in flight tests 
after being hired by continental in the summer of 1987 bruecher 
went through a series of simulator training tests in which 
instructors found him to have problems controlling his flights at 
one such test an instructor said bruecher completely lost control 
of his aircraft with engine out at 2000 feet according to 
continental documents reviewed by the safety board 
continental spokesman bruce hicks said the airline was not aware 
of bruechers previous training problems he said when inquiries 
were made about his previous employment everything we got was 
terrific 
hicks acknowledged that bruecher had problems in one of his 
training sessions in a simulator but said he had performed well at 
other times 
the ntsb was expected to issue a final report including the 
probable cause for the nov 15 crash later in the day 
the board also has been looking into a possible failure in 
procedures that may have allowed the aircraft to depart with snow 
or ice on its wings thereby inhibiting its ability to gain lift 
investigators said in opening todays hearing that as long as 27 
minutes was believed to have passed between when the dc9 was 
deiced and went it took off they said continentals operations 
manual requires a pilot to check for possible icing on the wings if 
there is a delay of 20 minutes but that there was no evidence such 
precautions were taken by the pilots of flight 1713 
the jet crashed seconds after lifting off from denvers 
stapleton international airport 
the dc9 is particularly susceptible to ice contamination 
because it has no slats on the leading edge of the wings 
bruecher had been hired by continental only four months prior to 
the crash and was making his first takeoff in a dc9 during snowy 
conditions he had a total of 3186 hours of flying but most of 
that was in propeller aircraft while working for a commuter 
airline he had only 36 hours on a dc9 and some of that was in 
training according to investigators 
capt frank zvonek 43 had 12135 total hours of flying time 
with 33 hours as a dc9 captain both bruecher and zvonek were 
killed in the crash 
since the accident the faa has advised airlines to require that 
the captain of a jetliner handle a takeoff in poor weather 
continental has put into place such a requirement since the 
accident and also has begun to arrange work flight assignments so 
that two relatively inexperienced pilots are not likely to be 
assigned to the same cockpit said richard hillman vice president 
for flight operations 
but hillman and other senior continental officials maintained in 
interviews monday that the two pilots on flight 1713 were qualified 
and properly trained they also said the aircraft had been properly 
deiced 
the ntsb findings are expected to be vigorously challenged by 
continental which maintains that the plane crashed because it 
encountered an unusual draft of wind a phenomenon called wake 
turbulence from another jetliner landing at a parallel runway 
1600 feet away 
the continental officials argued that the ntsb investigators 
have not given enough attention to the waketurbulence possibility 
our position is that this investigation is not complete 
until the wake turbulence possibility is more closely examined 
said bruce hicks a spokesman for continental

lawyers for drexel burnham lambert inc want the 
judge presiding over the companys securitiesfraud case removed 
because of an alleged conflict of interest involving his wifes 
family business according to a report published tuesday 
the motion to have us district judge milton pollack disqualify 
himself was contained in sealed court documents and revealed by 
unidentified sources familiar with the case the new york times 
reported 
drexel made the request last week but the grounds behind the 
motion were not made public 
pollack who has a reputation for being a tough judge had said 
he would hear arguments on the motion at an oct 11 hearing 
neither pollack nor drexels chief attorneys from the law firm 
cahill gordon amp reindel were available for comment tuesday their 
secretaries said 
the securities and exchange commission charged that drexel and 
other defendants including the firms junkbond chief michael 
milken schemed with nowimprisoned speculator ivan f boesky to 
trade on inside information manipulate stock bully drexel clients 
and engage in other securities frauds 
drexel has denied all charges 
the times said the motion to oust pollack raised a potential 
conflict involving drexels role in the acquisiton of a texas 
retail clothing chain palais royal of houston and the companys 
chairman moselle pollack who is the judges wife 
the newspaper said palais royal was founded by mrs pollacks 
family the erlichs 60 years ago and was close to being acquried 
by an unidentified company if the deal is completed mrs pollack 
and her husband stand to receive about 9 million the times quoted 
sources as saying 
drexels attorneys want pollack removed from the case because 
they feel he might appear to be biased in favor of drexel which is 
involved in raising financing for the deal the newspaper said

most corn futures prices closed moderately to 
sharply higher in a late rally tuesday on the chicago board of 
trade after an expected increase in farmers selling of newly 
harvested corn failed to emerge 
soybean futures advanced with the corn market but wheat futures 
finished slightly lower amid slack export demand analysts said 
the discovery over the weekend of the naturally occurring poison 
aflatoxin in some corn in iowa and indiana had prompted speculation 
that farmers would try to sell such corn immediately since the 
agriculture department would refuse to accept it as loan collateral 
the tainted corn is harmless when blended with enough good corn 
to render the total aflatoxin content no more than 20 parts per 
billion for human consumption or 100 parts per billion for animal 
consumption 
but with no evidence of a surge in farmers selling of corn 
since monday futures traders decided the aflatoxin scare had been 
exaggerated analysts said 
the talk was there but there wasnt the physical evidence of 
the corn coming to market said jerry gidel an analyst in 
chicago with the gh miller division of the britishowned trading 
company lit america inc 
at the close wheat was cent to 1 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in december at 421 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 6 cents higher with december at 287 a bushel oats 
were 1 cents lower to 2 cents higher with december at 246 a 
bushel soybeans were 2 cents to 7 cents higher with november at 
809 a bushel

coffee futures prices surged tuesday on new yorks coffee sugar 
amp cocoa exchange on indications that a new coffee pricesupport 
agreement was near 
on other markets sugar futures soared energy futures 
retreated copper and precious metals advanced frozen pork bellies 
plunged livestock were mixed grains and soybeans were mixed and 
stockindex futures retreated 
news arrived in new york at midday from the international coffee 
organizations meeting in london that brazil and colombia 
respectively the worlds no 1 and no 2 coffee producers had 
proposed an initial global export quota of 54 million bags for the 
198889 marketing year 
the reports sparked highvolume buying of coffee futures by 
roasters and speculators on ideas that the proposal could become 
the cornerstone of a new ico agreement for stabilizing coffee 
prices in the upcoming marketing year which begins oct 1 
this was significant not only in that these two countries have 
agreed on something but in that it sets the tone for the conference 
as a whole said arthur stevenson coffee market analyst in new 
york with prudentialbache securities inc it indicates the 
meeting is progressing harmoniously 
under the proposal coffee producers would limit sales to ico 
consumers to 54 million bags during the marketing year compared 
with this years initial quota of 58 million bags the ico can 
adjust the quota upward or downward during the year depending on 
market conditions to keep prices stable 
global coffee consumption is declining but demand for 
higherpriced mild coffees as opposed to the more plentiful 
robusta coffees is on the rise 
stevenson said consumer nations might agree to the lower quota 
which would tend to support prices if producers agree to increase 
the percentage of milds in the export mix 
coffee settled 215 to 283 cents higher with the contract for 
delivery in december at 12924 a pound 
sugar futures recovered nearly all of mondays sharp losses on 
buying inspired by technical factors and rumors of physical sugar 
purchases by china and the soviet union stevenson said 
sugar settled 37 cent to 69 cent higher with october at 986 
cents a pound 
crude oil futures dipped to 2year lows below 14 a barrel early 
in the session on the new york mercantile exchange but recovered to 
finish only slightly lower than mondays final prices 
analysts linked the early weakness to reports of continued 
discount sales of crude by saudi arabia and pessimism about opecs 
search for a solution to the overproduction that has been blamed 
for the persistent weakness of crude oil prices 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 6 cents to 15 cents 
lower with november at 1414 a barrel heating oil was 55 cent to 
72 cent lower with october at 3951 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 45 cent lower to 34 cent higher with october at

federal investigators on tuesday blamed the 
crash of a continental airlines jet nearly a year ago in denver on 
the captains failure to have the jetliner deiced a second time 
after it stood in a steady snowfall for 27 minutes 
the national transportation safety board also cited the 
inexperience of the captain and his copilot who was actually 
flying the aircraft and the heavy traffic conditions at as 
contributing factors in the accident 
continental flight 1713 crashed seconds after lifting off from 
denvers stapleton international airport on nov 15 1987 killing 
28 of the 82 people aboard the pilot and copilot were among those 
killed 
the investigation showed that the mcdonnell douglas dc9 had 
been deiced but then had to wait for 27 minutes until takeoff 
because of the heavy traffic flow and what investigators called 
confusion between the air traffic control tower over where several 
planes including flight 1713 were 
the national transportation safety board said that the pilots of 
flight 1713 ignored a continental airlines operations policy which 
required them to return for another deicing whenever an aircraft 
is delayed at least 20 minutes after having been deiced in snowy 
conditions 
the safety board in its probable cause said that the failure to 
deice a second time caused an unknown amount of ice 
contamination to adhere to the upper wing surface resulting in 
a loss of control during rapid takeoff rotation by the first 
officer 
the safety board cited the inexperience of the 26yearold 
copilot lee bruecher who the board said had never flown the 
dc9 in snowy conditions and had only 36 hours of experience in jet 
aircraft he was piloting during the takeoff 
the board said that bruecher lifted the nose of the plane off 
the runway at too severe an angle adding to problems the plane 
already faced in gaining lift because of the ice contamination 
the board cited as contributing factors in the accident the 
absence of regulatory or management controls over the operations 
of such pilots 
investigators also said the confusion over the location of 
flight 1713 as it awaited takeoff added about nine minutes to the 
aircrafts delay 
the safety board also raised concern about the experience level 
of the captain of flight 1713 frank zvonek 46 noting that he had 
been a high minimum captain who was not authorized without 
special permission to land an aircraft under the type of weather 
conditions that prevailed on the day of the crash 
robert benzon the boards chief investigator into the accident 
said that while technically zvonek was legally allowed to depart 
under those weather conditions he would not have been allowed 
except in an emergency to land under those conditions 
zvonek had flown 12125 hours in all aircraft but had only 133 
hours in a dc9 copilot and 33 hours as a captain investigators 
said zvonek and bruecher had never flown together before 
the ntsb findings immediately were challenged by continental 
airlines which has maintained all along that the crash was caused 
by displaced air currents caused by a boeing 767 jetliner that had 
landed three minutes before flght 1713s liftoff on a parallel 
runway 
richard hillman continentals vice president for flight 
operations said the board produced no evidence to conclusively 
show ice had developed on the aircrafts wings our position is 
that this investigation was not complete he said 
but the ntsb report said the wingtip vortex issue as the 
air current phenomenon is called had been examined thoroughly and 
discounted because of the position of the continental jet to the 
incoming jet at the time flight 1713 was encountering problems 
much of the boards report on the accident focused on bruechers 
training record although the panel said continentals training 
procedures had been adequate 
most airlines regularly have the captain and first officer or 
copilot trade off in taking control of the plane during different 
flight segments but since the denver crash many including 
continental have the flight captain at the controls during the 
takeoff 
according to the investigation bruecher had training problems 
with propeller aircraft before coming to continental in the summer 
of 1987 
in 1985 he was fired by an air taxi company after failing three 
times to pass his flight examination on a propeller plane despite 
30 hours of training according to investigators his examiner told 
the ntsb that other pilots passed the exam after only half that 
much training and that bruecher had chronic troubles became 
disoriented and seemed unable to cope with deviations from the 
routine 
a year later while at rio airlines a texas commuter carrier 
bruecher failed a fight check for a more advanced aircraft and was 
described by the examiner as being behind the airplane 
after continental airlines hired bruecher in july 1987 he also 
encountered difficulties during several sessions of his formal 
simulator training for operating jet aircraft during one session 
in the simulator he completely lost control of the aircraft 
with engine out at 2000 feet said one continental training 
report according to the ntsb 
but after the airlines routine seven simulator sessions on the 
dc9 bruecher was sent to the work on the flight lines as a 
copilot 
according to a summary of bruechers background check by ntsb 
investigators the copilot felt uneasy about some aspects of 
flying the dc9 jet as recently as two weeks before the denver 
crash

the united artists studio is the 
latest casualty in continued corporate shuffling at mgmua 
communications co under a 200 million restructuring announced 
tuesday 
the complex plan apparently depends on a substantial injection 
of cash from kirk kerkorian the los angeles investor who owns 79 
percent of the showbusiness congolmerate and has been trading its 
parts periodically for nearly 20 years 
the restructuring a 200 million stock rights offering to 
present stockholders who would get the right to buy additional new 
shares in mgmua maker of academy awardwinning moonstruck 
kerkorians tracinda corp which already owns 79 percent of 
mgmua intends to buy any of the new shares not bought by other 
stockholders the company said 
the plan appears similar to kerkorians previous failed 
shuffle of mgmua in that most of the cash injected into the 
debtburdened company would be his through purchase of more shares 
the company said it would stop producing all but a few movies 
under the united artists name consolidating production under mgm 
the former metrogoldwynmayer noted for its roaring lion 
trademark he said the james bond movies and other strings of 
sequels will continue carrying the ua name which also presently 
appears on betrayed 
mgmua is exploring the possiblity of selling a partinterest in 
its television production arm but does not plan to sell the ua 
name or film library said stephen silbert mgmuas chairman and 
chief executive officer 
thats not under consideration he said when asked about 
hollywood speculation that ua might be up for sale 
he refused to discuss a potential investor for mgmuas tv 
production unit which is responsible for the criticallyacclaimed 
series thirtysomething among other shows 
were at the stage of exploring it we havent made a 
decision silbert said 
details of the plan to issue new shares to present stockholders 
have not been worked out silbert said adding that the rights 
offering was expected to take place near the end of the year 
the announcement follows by a day the resignation of uas 
chairman and chief executive anthony thomopoulos lee rich

alan ladd resigned as head of the mgm production unit two weeks 
later 
in late july kerkorians twoweekold plan to split mgm and ua 
and sell a partinterest in mgm to beverly hills investor burt 
sugarman and two moviemakers fell through for undisclosed reasons 
that plan also called for sale of new stock to present 
shareholders with kerkorian buying any unsold shares 
under the new plan mgmuas bank debt of between 250 million 
and 275 million would be paid by money raised through the stock 
issue and sale of assets silbert said 
kerkorian who bought mgm in 1969 engaged in his biggest 
shuffle of mgm and ua assets in 1986 by selling the combined 
company to atlanta media entrepreneur ted turner and then buying 
back parts over a period of several months 
turner ended up with mgms library of classic films including 
the wizard of oz and gone with the wind kerkorian got the 
mgm and ua production companies minus the mgm studio lot which was 
sold to lorimartelepictures corp
