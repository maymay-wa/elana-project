michael dukakis certified his status as the 
democratic presidential frontrunner on tuesday with a thumping 21 
triumph over jesse jackson in the pennsylvania primary george bush 
won a resounding republican victory and predicted the state would 
deliver the final delegates needed to clinch the nomination 
by their victories bush and dukakis emerged as almost certain 
opponents in the fall general election campaign survivors of a 
campaign marathon that once featured seven democratic candidates 
and six republicans 
dukakis was gaining 65 percent of the democratic and said his 
victory would be very very helpful in his quest for the white 
house 
jackson was gaining 30 percent of the democratic vote and said 
he intended to compete through the last primary on june 7 im a 
longdistance runner he said its too close now to turn 
around 
vice president bush campaigned across ohio during the day 
declaring were almost getting down to the main event according 
to the ap this evening ill capture enough delegates in the 
pennsylvania primary to exceed the 1139 republican convention 
delegates needed for the nomination 
bush was gaining 79 percent of the vote to 12 percent for 
dropout sen bob dole and 9 percent for former television 
evangelist pat robertson president reagan agreed to drop his 
studied show of neutrality and bestow his blessings on his vice 
president in a white house meeting on wednesday 
the gop delegate count was far slower than the popular vote he 
needed to win 58 of the 78 delegates at stake to clinch his 
majority in the associated press delegate count and he seemed 
certain to get them bush won all of the first 14 tallied with the 
rest of the races still being counted 
dukakis won a separate landslide in election of delegates 
leading for 165 to 12 for jackson one was uncommitted that would 
bring dukakis national delegate total to 1266 compared to 850 
for jackson it takes 2081 to clinch nomination 
network polling place interviews contained news that was as good 
for dukakis as his vote totals 
though jackson gained more than 90 percent support from blacks 
abc polling analyst doug muzzio said that for the first time in the 
campaign season dukakis was winning a majority of voters who cited 
the poor and elderly as their chief concerns voters jackson won 
in prior contests he said dukakis also was winning voters who 
cited strong leadership and ability to make a change groups that 
jackson usually won in earlier races 
hes emerging as the consensus candidate pollster ia 
lewis of the los angeles times said of dukakis the next step is 
going to be binding the wounds pulling the party together and 
getting it directed against the republicans 
dukakis was cautious as ever 
asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his dukakis 
refused to claim the crown yet refering to democratic nominee 
walter mondales problems in 1984 
i reminded you several time that fritz mondale won new york 
and pennsylvania and then lost a string of primaries he said 
bush achieved his status as oddson favorite to win the 
nomination far faster than dukakis routing the republican eld on a 
single super tuesday on march 8 dukakis gained the upper hand week 
by week even so both men fared better than seemed possible when 
the nominating wars opened in iowa last february and both men 
wound up third in the states leadoff caucuses 
on tuesday both bush and dukakis already were pointing their 
campaigns toward the fall 
with 73 percent of the pennsylvania vote in the democratic vote 
was 
dukakis 745930 or 65 percent 
jackson 344284 30 percent 
on the republican side it was 
bush 447504 79 percent 
dole 68402 12 percent 
robertson 53166 9 percent 
dukakis said his pennsylvania victory was a very big boost 
particularly in a state that has been a bellwether state in the 
general election 
he said he would campaign as hard as i can in the remaining 
primaries 
jackson made clear he has the same intentions the contest 
will be determined on june 7 in california and new jersey he 
said from ohio which holds one of three primaries on next weeks 
calendar 
we have every reason to be hopeful if we keep winning every 
urban center our coalition is broad it is strong it is deep and 
were inspired to run on 
the outline of bushs campaign against dukakis was taking shape 
the vice president said the democratic frontrunner lacks foreign 
policy experience and added that will be a major issue in the 
fall 
the vice president also arranged to meet wednesday with 
president reagan spokesman marlin fitzwater said reagan will see 
him first thing in the morning and i am sure the president will 
offer his congratulations and discuss how he can help in the 
campaign 
on the democratic side dukakis was scarcely more than halfway 
toward a nominating majority but party officials were beginning to 
talk aloud about a firstballot victory for the man from 
massachusetts 
larryann willis an uncommitted superdelegate from oregon said 
if the voting goes the way its going in upcoming primaries 
dukakis will get it the nomination on the first ballot 
james ruvolo ohio democratic chairman agreed that dukakis 
enters his state with campaign momentum what i worry about is 
washington insiders trying to end the race before its over he 
said 
philadelphia mayor wilson goode had this advice for jackson 
hang in there 
dukakis forged his early pennsylvania lead after a weeklong 
campaign that looked and sounded more like a mutual admiration 
society than the typical 1988 democratic primary brawl 
jackson had scant hopes for a victory in pennsylvania where his 
campaign failed to file a complete slate of delegate candidates he 
already was looking ahead to next weeks primaries in the district 
of columbia indiana and ohio

a government review panel has cleared a 
married couple at the department of health and human services of 
violating federal travel rules or taking unauthorized trips at 
government expense according to a published report wednesday 
the departments ethics review board found that the trips by 
terry and paget hinch had been authorized and did involve 
government business the washington post reported 
the panel said in a written report that mrs hinch apparently 
had arranged three legitimate business trips so that she could be 
near her husband at the resort area of orlando fla and over 
thanksgiving near his familys home in the san franciso area 
the board said arranging the trips for the personal 
convenience of the hinches raised an appearance of 
impropriety and noted that it had sought and received voluntary 
reimbursement of 3264 for some costs related to the trips 
however the report added the board does not believe that any 
disciplinary action is warranted by the evidence relating to the 
official travel by terry and paget hinch

from 1975 to this march 226091 
vietnamese boat people have landed in malaysia an official said 
today 
the influx of vietnamese refugees began in 1975 after us 
forces withdrew from south vietnam and it fell to communist forces 
from north vietnam 
of the 226091 refugees 217812 resettled in other countries 
including 128000 in the united states said eric e morris the

brunei 
in the first three months of this year 2921 boat people 
reached malaysian shores higher than the 1702 for the same period 
last year he said 
morris told reporters the increase was due in part to 
thailands decision to forbid boats of refugees to land on its 
shores 
the boat people generally land on the east coasts of malaysia 
and thailand by cutting across the south china sea

salim shaar always liked 
fixing things he spent the last afternoon of his life laying new 
tiles on the family porch and wiring new lights 
he planned to finish the job the next day after a morning of 
throwing stones at israeli soldiers but a soldier thought he saw a 
firebomb in salims hand and the next time salim crossed the porch 
he was carried with a bullet hole in his head 
on an afternoon two weeks later members of the family sat at 
home sipping strong arab coffee and talking about the shy 
23yearold electrician bethlehems first martyr of the arab 
rebellion that began nearly five months ago in the israelioccupied 
lands 
this uprising changes everyone said salims father khalil 
it turns a sane man into a crazy man it turns a shy man into an 
angry man 
the clearest evidence of the change in salim is in his diary a 
frayed notepad from a souvenir shop lovingly preserved by his 
family it speaks of his growing desperation 
i dont dream about toys anymore mother salim wrote in an 
entry directed to his mother fatmah several weeks before his 
death when they killed my friends i grew up a thousand years 
when the violence began dec 8 salim was a goodnatured young 
man devoted to his job who often stopped at the homes of neighbors 
after work to see if anything needed fixing his family says 
people appreciated him and his work made him happy said 
his brother mohammed 21 he didnt have any great ambitions 
salim was happy at his familys home and had added a room to it 
where he could settle one day with a wife he filled the new 
closets with books on electricity and moved into the room only 
weeks before he died 
his possessions do not seem those of a man driven to die for a 
cause they reveal instead a young man who liked music turkish 
singers and traditional arab tunes and was an amateur 
photographer who filling albums with pictures of his friends 
friends and family said salim began to change when the 
intefadah arabic for uprising came to the towns and refugee 
camps near bethlehem taking the lives of young palestinians like 
himself 
salim was affected by what was going on said a cousin 
mussa he had many friends who went to prison and it became 
obvious to him that one day he too would go to jail so he wanted 
to prepare himself 
he began spending free time at the nearby dheishe refugee camp 
talking to palestinians who had been in jail and visiting the 
families of prisoners to offer emotional support 
in the diary salim sounds alternately desperate and defiant 
whats a human being worth without a homeland without a flag 
without an address he wrote and later the enemy planes can 
raid our camps and kill our children but cannot kill our will to 
fight 
the entry for friday april 1 the night before his death was 
the most striking if my friends come back without me mother 
dont cry every tear in your eyes is oil to light a lamp of 
freedom 
salim was in a good mood that saturday morning his family said 
he took a shower donned khaki trousers and a sweater kissed his 
mother and said if i come back i wont be late 
he and his brother mohammed set off to join friends in 
bethlehems market gathering stones along the way they became 
part of a group in central manger square where israeli soldiers 
were stationed 
when its over you go back home ill go to a friends 
house salim told mohammed anticipating the housetohouse 
search that often followed protests 
according to the army account of the mornings events a soldier 
thought he saw a firebomb in salims hand but the family called 
that absurd what noone disputes is that salim was killed 
instantly by a bullet that went through his right cheek and out the 
back of his neck 
his parents still in mourning clothes two weeks later became 
defiant in their grief when asked if they would stop their seven 
other children from joining protests 
we all have the right to demonstrate for what we believe in 
fatmah said i will never take that from my children 
khalil nodded and added besides salim is not really dead he 
lives on as a hero for our town

commander halcon and his band of 
nicaraguan rebels move freely around what they call their 
liberated zone in the jungles near the caribbean coast 
they are willing to talk peace but wont lay down their arms 
we have received orders from our high command to stop 
shooting halcon said as he sat under a tree while his men rested 
nearby but we are not dropping our guard the enemy cannot be 
trusted 
a peasant widow provided food and coffee to his company of young 
rebels including several women 
halcon a former sandinista who fought against the national 
guard of late strongman president anastasio somoza and his troops 
are in the jungles of southern zelaya province near the caribbean 
coast 
they are part of the southern front of the democratic nicarguan 
force or fdn the main contra force which has fought to overthrow 
the sandinista government 
the area is one of seven set up under a 60day ceasefire 
agreement between the usbacked contras and the sandinista 
under the agreement the sandinistas have promised not to attack 
contra troops congregating in the areas 
they dont come here anyway halcon said we liberated 
this zone a long time ago 
looking around at his troops halcon said there is no one 
here among us against his will 
the people know we are not mercenaries he said 
journalists traveled with the group for a day visiting 
different camps where they met groups of rebels halcon said he 
commands three companies of 100 men each in the rugged eastern zone 
sandinista army troops evacuated many of the residents from the 
mountainous region two years ago in an effort to remove the rebels 
social base but some people refused to leave 
they often help the contras and provide food they do the same 
for the sandinista army when it moves in 
some cattle still roam the area and contra groups use abandoned 
farms 
halcon and his men appeared to be wellarmed and in good 
spirits they had enough medicine and beef and plenty of usmade 
candy to eat at night they danced to tapes of mexican ranchera 
music then slept in hammocks made of silky parachute cloth 
the commander said the last air drop of us supplies to the 
group came a month ago 
under the ceasefire that took effect april 1 rebels may 
receive humanitarian aid through neutral international 
organizations once they are settled in the designated zones 
details of the truce are still being worked out in talks which 
will resume thursday 
halcon said he had received two letters from the regional 
commander of the sandinista army asking him to meet with the 
government represntatives in an effort to achieve peace 
he said he was waiting for further instructions from contra 
headquarters there have already been several meetings of army and 
rebel groups on the field since the ceasefire went into effect 
we will do whatever our leaders tell us halcon said if 
we had a complete ceasefire it would be the most beautiful thing 
we have been fighting among nicaraguans for too long but we are 
armed campesinos and we are willing to fight and we are not 
going to lay down our arms unless there is a definitive 
ceasefire 
we will lay down our arms when the sandinistas lay down 
theirs when there is a democratic government in nicaragua

the police chief is vowing to close 
down manilas honkytonk district which he claims had made it the 
sin capital of asia 
his targets are nightspots in the neighborhood known as the 
citys tourist belt where scantily clad girls bump and grind 
to disco music and for a price go out with male customers 
although the ermita district pumps millions of dollars each year 
into the citys economy authorities have called for replacing the 
nightspots with more wholesome family entertainment 
now we are known internationally as the center of the flesh 
trade the sin city of asia brig gen alfredo lim the 
capitals police chief said recently when we hear of this 
reference all of us feel a furious sense of outrage for we all 
know that we dont deserve such notoriety 
however bar owners say the crackdown will cause worse problems 
add to economic hardship and advance the spread of sexual disease 
last month police began raiding bars and discos in the citys 
ermita district they have rounded up more than 2000 barmaids 
known as hospitality girls and detained dozens of foreigners 
who operate some of more than 505 bars restaurants discos 
nightclubs and brothels in ermitas 10block strip 
president corazon aquino has backed the raids saying what we 
should guard against is sacrificing the dignity and honor of the 
filipino woman 
but in a country with many economic problems sex is big 
business 
lim said he expects bar owners mostly americans australians 
west germans japanese and filipinos to fight back by waging a 
smear campaign against him and his police force 
they are employing all tricks to stop us so they can earn 
bundles and bundles of money lim said they are capitalizing 
on our women 
indeed an typical ermita bar earns about 715 dollars on a 
regular day the bigger establishments average about 1666 daily 
but gilbert compuesto general manager of the hollywood show 
palace said the raids have been hurting the oncethriving 
entertainment industry cutting daily earnings by as much as 70 
percent 
moreover ronnie rueda operations manager of a leading club 
called firehouse said closing bars will force tens of thousands of 
manila prostitutes to go underground she says that will make it 
difficult to trace carriers of acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
and venereal diseases 
lim said 80 percent of 2000 women picked up in the raids have 
been found suffering from venereal disease the department of 
health said at least 50 filipinos mostly hospitality girls have 
been infected with the aids virus but none has developed its 
active symptoms 
the problem of venereal disease will spread out because the 
women will become freelancers they will hang around hotels and 
restaurants rueda said who will manage them and check them 
for diseases 
compuesto said his group has offered to help police by closing 
some establishments and ridding the area of freelance prostitutes 
but he says their offer has been ignored 
if they are really trying to cure the problem of morality 
this campaign should be nationwide compuesto said how can 
they solve immorality prostitution or drug abuse if they are only 
concentrating on ermita 
other critics say closing ermitas seedy establishments would 
force some displaced workers into a life of crime if youre 
starving and youre the only breadwinner in the family i think 
there is nothing else to do said kit samson a disc jockey 
compuesto said most bar girls are earning more than the 3 
minimum daily wage of factory workers not counting what they earn 
once they leave the bars with customers 
thousands of people dont have jobs we have jobs that we 
enjoy but now they want to get it from us compuesto said 
what kind of logic is that 
its really a hypocrisy of people to say that when tourists 
come to the philippines they just want to see the sights in 
tagaytay baguio or some other part of the country compuesto 
said they need entertainment

civil rights groups are worried that a supreme 
court decision to reconsider a 12yearold ruling on race 
discrimination could be the beginning of an effort to reverse basic 
legal advances for minorities 
conservatives see it as signaling the possible end of an era 
where they believe legal principles were bent to favor minorities 
the message is theres a new court now that justice anthony 
m kennedy is on board and previous rulings are up for grabs 
said ira glasser executive director of the american civil 
liberties union it is an ominous development 
by a 54 vote monday the justices took the unusual initiative 
of broadening the scope of a north carolina racialharassment case 
so that they could consider limiting the ability of minorities to 
sue private citizens for monetary damages 
arthur spitzer the aclus legal director here said the courts 
action will have enormous psychological impact by indicating 
basic civil rights decisions now may be considered open to 
attack 
a conservative constitutional lawyer hailing the action said 
it comes from a court no longer willing to say as it has in the 
past that any statutory interpretation that is a victory for 
minorities automatically wins even if youve got to bend legal 
principles 
the lawyer bruce fein visiting fellow in constitutional 
studies at the conservative think tank heritage foundation said 
the action could lead the court to take another look at other cases 
which represent really almost absurd efforts to rewrite intent 
and legislative history 
this indicates to me fein said that the court is going 
to take a hard look at statutory civil rights and be willing to 
overturn decisions where they were based on really flawed 
reasoning even if the results are politically unpopular 
kennedy who joined the court in february provided a fifth vote 
monday to reexamine the 1976 ruling that expanded the right of 
minorities to sue over alleged discrimination 
the other four are chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices byron r white antonin scalia and sandra day oconnor 
scalia oconnor and kennedy were appointed to the court by 
president reagan a frequent critic of rulings he regards as too 
liberal 
justice john paul stevens in a sharply worded dissent said 
minorities may feel betrayed by the courts willingness to consider 
discarding an important civil rights precedent 
he said the action is unwise activism and will have a 
detrimental and enduring impact on the publics perception of the 
court as an impartial adjudicator 
he was joined by justices william j brennan harry a blackmun 
and thurgood marshall 
their views were echoed by glasser who said the five in the 
majority have made careers of extolling the virtue of judicial 
restraint 
glasser continued in this case they have reopened a major 
strand of the civil rights enforcement infrastructure when neither 
party in the case has asked to do so and when there is no ferment 
in the courts below 
the court majority in an unsigned order said it is surely 
no affront to settled jurisprudence to request argument on whether 
a particular precedent should be modified or overruled 
the north carolina case argued last feb 29 now will be held 
over until the courts next term beginning in october a ruling is 
likely in 1989 
in the case brenda patterson a black woman wants to use a 
postcivil war law to force her employer mcclean credit union to 
pay actual and punitive damages for alleged harassment 
lower federal courts said the law the civil rights act of 1866 
is designed only to ban racial discrimination in hiring firing and 
promotion not racial harassment 
ms patterson still could charge racial harassment under a 1964 
civil rights law but the more recent law provides that those who 
win their cases in court may collect back pay not potentially big 
awards as compensation for emotional and mental suffering 
civil rights groups say the more limited 1964 law may not be a 
sufficient deterrent to harassment 
the court agreed to use ms pattersons appeal to reconsider a 
1976 ruling called runyon vs mccrary that held that racially 
segregated private schools violate the 1866 law the statute was 
enacted to ensure that recently freed slaves would enjoy all the 
rights of citizenship 
the 1976 decision has given civil rights groups an important 
legal weapon to fight racial bias by permitting them to use the law 
as a basis for lawsuits against private individuals 
in other action the court 
turned away the first dialaporn case ever to reach it 
letting stand a ban on sexually explicit telephone message services 
in arizona 
agreed to decide whether wardens of federal prisons should have 
sweeping power to say what publications inmates may read

new declarations that the united states 
doesnt want a serious shooting war with iran come amid signs 
that the reagan administration is backing away from earlier 
proposals to broaden the us role in the persian gulf 
the new suggestions by top administration officials come after a 
weeklong review of persian gulf policy triggered by the april 18 
clash between the navy and iran in which six iranian ships were 
damaged or sunk 
last week us officials had said the policy was under review 
specifically the rules of engagement which permitted the navy only 
to protect itself and 11 reflagged kuwaiti tankers 
but on monday administration officials suggested that there may 
be no change in that policy secretary of state george shultz 
stressed that no final decision had been made but said we will 
not get tied up in any serious shooting war with the iranians 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater reflected the new line 
telling reporters that everybody acknowledges that we need to 
move back to some more limited set of rules 
for the past 10 months navy ships have been escorting the 11 
reflagged kuwaiti tankers through the gulf which is one of the 
venues for the long iraniraq war kuwait is an ally of iraq 
the united states has previously attacked iranian forces and 
facilities in retaliation for iranian minelaying activities last 
weeks clash was in revenge for an april 14 incident in which a 
navy frigate hit a mine the united states claimed was laid by iran 
administration officials had suggested last week that the rules 
might be changed to let the navy aid other merchant ships should 
those vessels come under attack 
right now the rules of engagement are essentially the same as 
they were last week reflecting the emergency nature of the 
situation fitzwater said monday but the question is where do 
we move back to i cant discuss specifics 
shultz appearing on nbcs today program from belgium where 
he was meeting with other nato officials said as far as our 
rules of engagement are concerned what the right ones are for this 
stage of the game in the gulf is being considered in washington 
and there is a process of consultation going on and i think its 
premature to describe them in any particular way 
on april 18 fitzwater said navy vessels were given wider 
latitude youll recall at that point that our ships were 
engaging hostile forces in any number of areas and we now want to 
move back to our conservative set of rules and so that decision 
has to be made about where to move back to 
one change may be the addition of up to six 110foot coast guard 
boats to help patrol the shallow gulf waters 
that proposal was criticized on capitol hill where senators 
noted that the coast guard is already cutting back its antidrug 
patrols and some routine search and rescue missions because of 
budget cuts but the navy has offered to pay for the coast guards 
persian gulf patrols 
ridiculous harebrained absolute utter nonsense said sen 
alfonse damato rny a critic of administration antidrug 
policies 
sen mark hatfield of oregon ranking republican on the senate 
appropriations committee said i dont know what the rationale 
for that would be weve put a lot of additional burdens on the 
coast guard in the last few years and id think they have a full 
plate 
the committee will meet later this week to consider shifting 
money to the coast guard to meet a 100 million budget shortfall 
the lightly armed island class patrol boats would be pulled 
off antidrug patrols in the caribbean coast guard officials said 
monday the boats would be replaced by new coast guard cutters now 
under construction 
adm paul a yost commandant of the coast guard said if the 
president chairman of the joint chiefs think those boats would be 
a help over there im more than delighted to send them and my 
coast guard personnel are ready to go really raring and ready to 
go 
the coast guard is part of the transportation department but 
the agency also falls under defense department jurisdiction for 
national security purposes 
the boats which would be used in the gulf operations have a 
maximum speed of more than 26 knots and carry a crew of 16 the 
vessels are armed with one 20mm machine gun in the front and two 
762mm machine guns elsewhere another 20mm machine gun can be 
added

a teenager walking barefoot along 
a busy street was electrocuted when she stepped on a steel plate 
that covered wiring for a light post authorities said 
sunday mornings accident that killed 17yearold veronika 
beatriz feria was just a death waiting to happen said ott 
cefkin a fort lauderdale police spokesman 
the street and wiring had been moved to make way for the 
entrance of a new shopping center it was badly rewired and set the 
grating alive with 480 volts said police and a florida power and 
light spokesman 
had the victim been wearing shoes she probably would have been 
insulated from the current said fpl spokesman don ostberg 
feria who moved to oakland park from peru had been celebrating 
the 18th birthday of her best friend lina torres on saturday 
they had gone to the beach with another friend beatriz 
lopezaguirre 29 and were on their way to her apartment shortly 
before 5 am 
ferias friends received mild shocks when they tried in vain to 
revive her 
a motorist michael a spector stopped to help and pulled her 
body off the plate using a towel for insulation authorities said 
cefkin said city workers investigating the accident told police 
a poorly insulated wire had been improperly positioned on the lip 
of the box beneath the steel plate when the lid was placed on the 
box the insulation was severed 
it turned that cover into a hot plate cefkin said 
ostberg said hed never heard of that happening 
cefkin said it was unclear who was responsible for the wiring 
but the investigation was continuing

imagine it newspaper stories next year that 
begin with the words vice president and secretary of defense sam 
nunn said today that 
there would be a lot of ifs to be surmounted if georgias senior 
democratic senator were in a position to assume such a jawbreaking 
and unprecedented dual title 
massachusetts gov michael dukakis would have to win the 
democratic presidential nomination ask nunn to be his running 
mate offer him the pentagon as an inducement to accept and then 
win the fall campaign 
but the idea is being floated apparently seriously by such 
leading democrats as former virginia gov charles robb 
others say nunn as a prominent southerner and respected defense 
expert would so strengthen a dukakis ticket that he should be 
promised he could be secretary of state or national security 
adviser if he also agrees to run for vice president 
nunn has said that no matter what inducements might be offered 
his interest in the vice presidency is just about one on a scale of 
10 
but he has never said never 
no vice president has ever served simultaneously as secretary of 
defense 
no vice president has ever served simultaneously as a member of 
a presidents cabinet 
but a number of people who became vice president had previously 
served in presidential cabinets 
john c calhoun served as vice president in one period and as 
secretary of state at another 
presidents have appointed vice presidents to task forces on one 
subject or another 
president reagan named vice president george bush to head a task 
force on drugs and narcotics president john f kennedy named his 
vice president lyndon b johnson to head a task force on space 
exploration 
other vice presidents have had a strong influence on their 
administrations but that has been the rare exception rather than 
the rule 
while not barred by the constitution a vice president 
simultaneously serving as secretary of defense might well discover 
a thicket of unexpected conflicts 
while the vice president has his job by election a cabinet 
officer must be confirmed by the senate 
the only job specifically assigned the vice president by the 
constitution is to serve as president of the senate 
unexpected strains might arise if the senate were asked to 
confirm its own presiding office to serve as well in a cabinet post 
in the role of the senates presiding officer the vice 
presidents only real power is his ability to cast tiebreaking 
votes at moments of legislative impasse 
some senators might demand that a vice president who was also 
the secretary of defense abstain from breaking a tie on closely 
divided defense issues directly affecting his department 
such a decision would deprive the administration of its ability 
to decide the issue in its favor by breaking the tie 
since 1981 bush has broken seven ties five of them on defense 
issues 
secretaries of defense routinely testify before congressional 
committees in defense of military budgets there is some potential 
awkwardness in a situation when the witness is also president of 
the senate 
concern might also be triggered if it became necessary for an 
elected vice president also serving as secretary of defense to 
travel with a president to an overseas conference 
that would place both the president and vice president out of 
the country at the same time and that might become a more 
worrisome situation if the country they were visiting were the 
soviet union 
naming nunn the national security adviser might create fewer 
such problems since the person who fills that post is not confirmed 
by the senate 
the vice presidency has not always been a happy post for the 
person who held the job many have complained it consists of little 
more than attending the funerals of foreign leaders 
john adams the nations first vice president had some thoughts 
on his job which he shared with his colleagues on the eve of a 
visit to their chamber by president washington 
gentlemen i feel great difficulty in how to act adams 
said 
i am possessed of two separate powers i am vice president in 
this i am nothing but i may be everything 
but i am president also of the senate when the president 
comes into the senate what shall i be 
some politicians are still thinking about what a vice president 
shall be at least when sam nunns name comes up for discussion

soviet officials are giving up hopes of sharp 
cuts in strategic nuclear arsenals before president reagan leaves 
office and fear he may be returning to redbaiting as he prepares 
to make his exit 
the problem is that the american position is moving not 
forward but backward said valentin falin chairman of the 
semiofficial novosti news agency 
as far as i can see we dont have enough time to prepare any 
formal treaty before the moscow summit may 29june 2 falin said 
in an interview on monday 
falin a nonvoting member of the policymaking soviet central 
committee and former soviet ambassador to west germany blamed the 
reagan administration and the us political process for what he 
called wasted time since the summit in washington last december 
certainly we cannot accomplish in the following four weeks 
what we have failed to do in four months said falin 
certainly we cannot expect miracles 
falin also criticized a us intelligence report saying the 
soviet economy has not improved despite economic reforms by soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev 
he said the joint report by the central intelligence agency and 
pentagon analysts might have been done to show the president that 
the soviet union is almost on its deathbed and it needs just 
another push that he should not talk with the soviet union but 
push it 
falin contested the pessimistic us intelligence report and 
said that under gorbachev industrial production rose more than 4 
percent last year and agricultural production was up 9 percent 
higher than any rate in a decade 
the us intelligence studies said the production of goods and 
services last year in the soviet union grew by only 05 percent 
after a 4 percent jump in 1986 
falin said the gloomy us intelligence report and recent 
speeches by the president may signal a return to the harsh 
antisoviet rhetoric of reagans first years in office when he 
called the soviet union an evil empire 
i would say that in his most recent speech as well as his 
speeches in march and february the president was preoccupied with 
rhetoric said falin bearing in mind that he will not remain 
in office for a long time he is trying to say in his last speeches 
what he lost the chance to say in 1981 and 1982 
we have already passed the time when we could tolerate such 
rhetorical escapades 
gorbachev complained after meeting with secretary of state 
george p shultz in moscow last week that the administration was 
marking time in arms control negotiations 
reagan has said that he will not tailor his arms control 
positions to meet political deadlines and does not expect the 
meeting in moscow to wrap up the proposed strategic arms reduction 
treaty to cut strategic nuclear arsenals by 30 to 50 percent 
previously soviet officials were more optimistic in public 
assessments of the summit falins comments reflected what has 
become public pessimism by the kremlin 
falin also accused the reagan administration of dragging its 
heels in negotiations for an international convention to curb 
chemical weapons and on warsaw pact proposals for cuts in 
nonnuclear forces in europe 
but whatever the prospects for the summit said falin reagan 
will be accorded our very warm and very deep hospitalities 
as we look at summits we think they are convened not to 
express sentiments but to become milestones in the development of 
bilateral and international relations said falin this is a 
problem for the president because it is important for him how he 
finishes his political career 
at best said falin the meeting may produce a framework 
for the development of future negotiations this will make 
negotiations easier 
but no start accord is likely by the end of the year and it is 
doubtful that reagan and gorbachev would meet again for what would 
be their fifth summit he said 
after moscow said falin i do not think that your president 
will have enough authority to make obligations which would have to 
be fulfilled by his successor 
the soviets he said are frustrated by the american political 
process 
in your country it is a dead political season said falin 
every four years in your political life one year is wasted 
he declined to say whether the kremlin would prefer to deal with 
vice president george bush who has virtually clinched the 
republican presidential nomination or with the democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis 
the soviet leadership would prefer to negotiate with the 
person who will be elected to the white house by your people 
said falin

george bush has had a virtual lock on the 
republican presidential nomination since late march but todays 
pennsylvania primary should make it a mathematical certainty 
the contest in which bush only faces token opposition from 
former television evangelist pat robertson should raise his 
delegate total to more than the 1139 needed for nomination at the 
gop convention in august in new orleans 
savoring the situation on the eve of that vote bush told an 
airport rally in scranton pa on monday we got a break in this 
primary process im glad its gone my way 
the vice president noted that due to his overwhelming lead in 
the race for the gop nomination the campaign spotlight has been 
mostly on the democratic contenders but he said he wasnt 
complaining 
the news is being dominated by the jacksondukakis fight 
thats the way it should be said bush i wouldnt trade 
places 
bush predicted that the general election is going to be hard 
fought its going to be close 
the vice president was campaigning today in ohio and indiana 
both of which hold primaries a week from today bush was attending 
a rally in lima ohio addressing the ohio broadcasters association 
in cincinnati and holding an airport rally in evansville ind 
bush tells audiences hell still campaign through to the end of 
the primary season and cant wait to debate the democratic 
nominee who he has predicted will be michael dukakis 
even so bush remains vague on the terms for such events 
im not going to let some outside group even within my own 
party set the agenda he told reporters in pittsburgh 
ill appoint somebody who knows about setting up debates and 
who could work with democrats in coming up with a process agreeable 
to both parties he said 
on another subject bush said in pittsburgh that he fully backs 
president reagans vow to veto trade legislation nearing a final 
congressional vote 
however bush said he hoped that some other way could be found 
to notify workers of impending plant closings 
the bill which dukakis has said he would sign if he were 
president contains a provision requiring 60 days advance when 
plants are to be shut down 
maybe theres a compassionate way to give notice to a worker 
and his family but it has nothing to do with the trade bill 
bush said i know its an emotional issue but the bill 
interferes with our ability to compete 
bush did acknowledge that there were still areas of pennsylvania 
and elsewhere that had not shared fully in the economic recovery 
that is now in its sixth year but he criticized democrats saying 
they talk about despair and agony 
youre going to see a clear choice in the general election 
he said 
bush has had a huge lead for the gop nomination since his 
remarkable 17state sweep in the march 8 super tuesday contests a 
lead he solidified with the withdrawal from the race on march 29 of 
sen bob dole his only remaining major rival 
robertson is still technically a candidate but has ceased active 
campaigning saying there is no way bush can be denied the 
nomination he has a scant 31 delegates to bushs 1081 
at his campaign appearance monday at the scrantonwilkesbarre 
airport bush was confronted by about two dozen protesters 
im glad to see the jesse jackson supporters here or maybe 
the mike dukakis supporters he said 
of the democrats he said i will welcome them in debate i 
will welcome taking on their ticket and we will beat them in the 
fall

supreme court justice anthony m kennedy two 
months on the job has given liberals their first real cause for 
concern that he will help forge a solid conservative court majority 
kennedy was part of a 54 majority that said monday it is 
thinking about overturning a 1976 decision considered a key civil 
rights victory 
the ruling 12 years ago never undone by congress interpreted a 
civil war era law as allowing lawsuits for monetary damages against 
private businesses and individuals over alleged racial 
discrimination 
the decision in runyon vs mccrary adopted in hundreds of lower 
court cases since has become what one civil rights lawyer called 
a major strand of the civil rights enforcement infrastructure 
mondays announcement sparked sharp criticism and dire 
predictions four justices said it could shake minorities faith in 
the court 
time alone will tell whether the erosion of faith is 
unnecessarily precipitous said justice john paul stevens a 
swing vote who most often sides with the courts liberals but in 
the meantime some of the harm that will flow from todays order may 
never be completely undone 
ira glasser executive director of the american civil liberties 
union agreed the message is theres a new court and previous 
rulings are up for grabs he said if this decision possibly 
can be overturned perhaps a lot more are endangered 
the courts three reagan appointees kennedy and justices 
sandra day oconnor antonin scalia joined chief justice william 
h rehnquist and byron r white in voting to restudy the 1976 
decision 
joining stevens in dissent were justices william j brennan 
thurgood marshall the courts leading liberals and justice harry 
a blackmun another swing vote 
will there be five votes to overturn the 1976 precedent 
rehnquist long the courts most conservative member and white 
a conservative with a generally liberal voting record in civil 
rights cases dissented from the 1976 decision two likely votes to 
overturn 
scalia is considered as conservative as rehnquist a third vote 
the keys may be the votes of oconnor who in recent years has 
shown greater independence from the courts conservative bloc and 
kennedy who joined the court last feb 18 
kennedy won senate confirmation only after reagans nomination 
of robert h bork was rejected 
borks critics in the senate and among the civil rights 
organizations who opposed him said they feared his replacing 
centrist lewis f powell on the court could threaten 30 years of 
civil rights precedents 
in its first seven years the reagan administration has had 
little success persuading the court to adopt the presidents 
conservative agenda outlawing abortion restoring prayers in 
public schools and curtailing affirmative action 
kennedy whose views on such matters are unknown is viewed as a 
staunch conservative less ideological than bork some liberals 
voiced the hope that he would assume powells role as the courts 
voice of judicial restraint 
but the concerns voiced during the bork nomination fight were 
echoed monday 
calling kennedy the key to a new court the aclus glaser 
said bork had an extensive record of civil rights animus and 
kennedy did not but this isnt encouraging

nuclear regulatory commission chairman lando 
zech says he agrees with a congressional study recommending that 
the agency improve its internal investigations 
he made the statement monday as his agency released a study by 
the general accounting office that said the nrc needs to ensure 
that its investigations are done professionally and competently 
the commission will give careful consideration to the entire 
report in our continuing efforts to assure that we carry out our 
investigative responsibilities fairly and efficiently zech said 
in the study gao said the important mission and critical 
safety role of the nrc require that it possess a firstrate 
investigative capability 
gao the investigative wing of congress said the study was 
based on review of three investigations made within the nuclear 
agency gao said that in two cases the work done by the nrcs 
office of inspector and auditor was not thorough enough 
one case involved allegations by an nrc inspector that superiors 
had pressured him to change findings in 1986 about safety 
conditions at the comanche peak steam electric station in texas 
the other involved alleged improper discussions in 1986 between 
victor stello the nrcs executive director of operations and 
steve white head of the tennessee valley authoritys nrcregulated 
nuclear program 
gao said its review supported the findings of nrc investigators 
who said neither matter was improper but in both cases gao said 
that nrc investigators had not interviewed individuals with key 
roles 
the third case looked into nrcs probe of how a copy of an 
internal nrc document turned up in 1985 in the files of the 
louisiana power and light companys waterford iii plant along 
with a memo from lpls holding company saying the document had been 
received from sources inside the nrc 
gao said notations on the copy indicated it was duplicated from 
the file copy in the office of nrc commissioner thomas roberts who 
was in charge of investigating the alleged leak 
gao was critical of the very limited investigation made by 
roberts but gao said it was unable to determine how the copy 
reached the regulated utility 
a properly conducted investigation might have provided nrc 
with the identity of the leaker according to gao 
the case gao said demonstrated that a regulated utility 
secured unauthorized access to nrc documents the ability to obtain 
such materials could impact on the nrcs enforcement program 
licensing functions and regulatory procedures 
the nrc should assure that its investigators conduct their 
work in a competent manner using professional standards said 
gao adding that there is a lack of coordination between the nrcs 
office of investigations and office of inspector and auditor

senate republicans are trying to make sure the 
mediumrange missile treaty is ratified before president reagan 
meets soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev in moscow on may 29 but 
the majority leader says democrats wont be rushed 
senate minority leader bob dole rkan appealed on monday for 
swift action on the treaty he said the president deserves to be 
accommodated on his wish not to go to moscow emptyhanded 
president reagan has said it is important for the senate to 
ratify the treaty before he meets gorbachev because there is little 
chance the two sides will make further arms control progress unless 
the senate has acted favorably 
but majority leader robert c byrd of west virginia said he 
refused to be rushed or harried on the matter before remaining 
problems are cleared away 
byrd said he will not call up the treaty for debate before may 
9 he added he may not do so then unless it can be shown the 
soviets agree with the us position that the pact bans 
mediumrange futuristic weapons such as those using laser rays 
or particle beam generators 
dole and other republicans huddled monday with white house chief 
of staff howard baker and national security adviser colin powell to 
devise a strategy to deal with byrds concerns and get the treaty 
debate started 
byrd replied i want to accommodate the president too and 
will accommodate the president where i can but that is not my 
first responsibility that is not my first objective 
im going to accommodate the senate and our responsibilities 
under the constitution first before the accommodation of anybody 
else or any other office 
the treaty is silent on future weapons but us negotiators 
contend the pact bans all weapons with ranges of from 300 miles to 
3400 miles no matter how they are armed

in an effort to put out the fire the spokesman said 
enchova and four connected fields were shut down halting the 
production of 71000 barrels of oil and 2 million cubic meters of 
gas per day pinto said 
the campos basin offshore fields produce 60 percent of the

the quartermillion atomic veterans 
exposed to radiation during world war ii and openair nuclear tests 
in the two decades that followed would receive new health benefits 
under a bill before the house 
the democraticcontrolled chamber is expected to vote on the 
bill this week the senate passed it monday by a 4830 vote 
house passage would send the measure to president reagan who 
has threatened to veto the legislation because of its high costs 
and because administration officials claim there is no scientific 
basis for the bill 
the measure would cost an estimated 36 million in its first 
year to pay for extra medical benefits 
the 250000 surviving atomic veterans are us service personnel 
who took part in the occupation of hiroshima and nagasaki after 
us atomic bombs were dropped on those two japanese cities in 
august 1945 or who took part in openair tests of atomic weapons 
in the southern pacific ocean or nevada 
many of the servicemen wore little or no protective gear during 
the tests and some have claimed that their exposure to radiation 
caused cancer 
the bill would make a presumptive finding that 13 different 
cancers are related to their radiation exposure during the tests or 
the japanese service 
existing law provides that veterans who have cancer can be 
compensated or receive health benefits but they must show in each 
case that the cancer is related to the military service 
only 28 of the nearly 5000 veterans who have filed 
radiationrelated claims with the veterans administration have been 
approved for disability benefits 
the bill now before the house began as an amendment to a much 
larger health and compensation bill for the nations 274 million 
military veterans 
but the atomic veteran provision was dropped after the white 
house said reagan would veto a measure containing the amendment 
sen alan cranston dcalif chairman of the senate veterans 
affairs committee supported the measure because he told his 
colleagues it is time to be fair to these men 
but sen alan simpson rwyo said the bill just ignores 
sound medical scientific evidence its just an absurd 
approach toward compensation 
sen james mcclure ridaho said that scientists are still 
unsure about how much level ionizing radiation causes cancer 
sen paul simon dill agreed up to a point 
we do not yet know the full relationship between lowlevel 
radiation and latent illness he said but it is crystal clear 
that many of those responsible for setting policies that affect 
thousands of our citizens are intent upon making the facts fit 
their theories and decisions instead of the other way around

black people may have a gene that gives their 
kidneys the unique ability to function well on very limited amounts 
of salt but which also can cause high blood pressure and disease 
when too much salt is consumed a researcher suggested today 
dr robert g luke of the university of cincinnati medical 
center said the existence of this unique kidney gene is suggested 
by the mixed results of efforts to prevent disease by controlling 
high blood pressure among black people 
speaking at a national kidney foundation seminar luke said 
controlling high blood pressure or hypertension has resulted in a 
reduction in stroke and heart disease 
but it has not caused a reduction in the rate of a kidney 
disease caused by hypertension and striking differences between 
the races suggest there may be a geneticbased difference in the 
cause of high blood pressure 
all kidney disease is more common among blacks than whites 
said luke the chairman of the department of internal medicine at 
the university of cincinnati endstage renal disease terminal 
kidney failure is three times more common in blacks than in 
whites 
he said that at a birmingham ala transplant center which 
performs about half its transplants on black patients there have 
been many instances where kidneys transplanted from a white donor 
to a black patient with high blood pressure has resulted in the 
recipient becoming normotensive or achieving a normal blood 
pressure 
this suggests that the cause of the original high blood 
pressure was the patients own kidneys he said 
luke said hypertension among laboratory animals also has been 
controlled by the transplant of kidneys from normotensive rats 
to ones with high blood pressure 
studies also have shown he said that black people tend to 
retain more salt excreting less of the mineral in their urine than 
white people 
all of this suggests said luke that a hereditary kidney 
abnormality may actually cause high blood pressure 
he said there is speculation that this kidney characteristic 
developed through evolution in central africa where salt is 
naturally very limited in that environment the kidney 
characteristic represented a darwinian advantage for people who 
lived there he said 
in very hot and dry climates in inland areas of low 
availability of salt he said an ability of the kidney to 
carefully and quickly conserve salt may confer a survival advantage 
in evolution 
that advantage however becomes a disadvantage and eventually 
leads to disease if there is an overabundance of salt in the diet 
said luke 
chronic but subtle salt retention may lead over long periods 
to high blood pressure possibly as a complication of the bodys 
response to try to force the kidney to excrete more salt he said 
and high blood pressure in turn often leads to kidney disease 
heart attack and stroke medication can control the high blood 
pressure and reduce heart attack and stroke but there is no 
similar reduction in kidney disease he said 
but a genetic basis for high blood pressure is still 
speculation luke said in an interview and a puzzle that we are 
still trying to understand

dukakis the frontrunner in todays pennsylvania primary 
he was a hit with the preschool set monday was a day of big 
crowds and loud cheers for dukakis and the massachusetts governor 
was trying out a relaxed campaign style 
dukakis held a big lead over rival jesse jackson in 
pennsylvania and about all aides had to wonder about was how big a 
delegate victory he could win in the state 
i look forward to working with you and to winning with you 
tomorrow dukakis told about 500 people in pittsburgh on the eve

dukakis was at ease and ready to quip 
i saw a bush sign around here some place he asked 1000 
gathered on the university of scranton campusyou know bush is 
the only guy who had a baseball league named after him 
then he asked if the crowd held any fans of the baltimore 
orioles the team with the worst record in baseball at the moment 
where are the orioles fans around here you know if youre an 
orioles fan you have to be headed for a career in social work or 
something you have to be very charitable he said 
but scranton brought dukakis facetoface with some of the most 
strident demonstrators of the campaign thus far fifty 
antiabortion protesters sought to form a gantlet for the candidate 
outside the hall at the university of scranton 
stop dukakis stop abortion they chanted dukakis was 
escorted to the car by a group of aides and police officers amid 
much pushing and shoving 
from philadelphia to pittsburgh from erie to harrisburg 
dukakis took his message of jobs and party unity 
there is no more important challenge facing the president of 
united states make no mistake about it im a dyedinthewool 
trueblue fullemployment democrat he said in erie 
he repeatedly urged his supporters to ignore the polls and to 
get out the vote pollsters dont vote he said 
a win in the complicated election tuesday would boost his lead 
for the 1988 democratic presidential nomination in both delegates 
and momentum 
it isnt enough just to vote for me he told 2000 cheering 
supporters at a park in erie this is one election where youve 
got to vote more than once and its legal i need your vote as a 
candidate our delegates need your votes we must do both 
the crowd was enthusiastic often interrupting dukakis with 
applause and cheers after the speech many in the crowd pressed 
forward to touch dukakis and to shake his hand several babies were 
handed to him smiling he kisssed them 
with your help we can leave pennsylvania with the kind of 
enthusiasm and the kind of energy and the kind of momentum that a 
victory will give he told them 
at his first stop in phildelphia dukakis reached out to the 
black community that is the core of jacksons support 
we have too much to do in this country to divide ourselves 
dukakis told about 60 people gathered a black church in northeast 
philadelphia im someone who believes that one of the jobs of a 
governor and a president perhaps the most important job is to 
bring this country together brown black and white business and 
labor these past seven years have been a divisive seven years

the european economic community needs to get 
serious about seeking solutions to an increasingly chaotic 
condition in global agricultural trade says agriculture 
secretary richard e lyng 
but the eec is unwilling to even define a longterm goal in the 
reform of the rules of international trade lyng said they 
term our proposal to eventually eliminate tradedistorting 
subsidies as unrealistic or too far too fast yet they have 
not stated what alternative they will accept 
it has been almost a year and a half since the new uruguay round 
of multinational trade talks began under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade or gatt yet lyng said the major agricultural 
shippers are expanding export subsidies rather than reducing them 
lyng warned that failure to make progress in the negotiations by 
the time of the gatt midterm review in montreal next december 
will bring into question the chance for eventual success of the 
uruguay round 
im not pessimistic but ill have to admit theres not a 
whole lot to be optimistic about at this point lyng said 
lyng said the eec for example has just paid a subsidy equal to 
126 per metric ton to wheat exporters and continues to pay huge 
subsidies on a host of other commodities including mixed feed 
291 per ton durum wheat 281 per ton and barley 130 per ton 
the united states he said at a meeting of the newspaper farm 
editors of america is calling for agricultural trade reform at the 
uruguay round ultimately under the us proposal international 
trade barriers and subsidies would be eliminated over a period of 
10 years or so 
lyng said the excessive influence of governments in farm 
product markets leads to a grossly inefficient allocation of 
resources in developed countries and leave poorer developing 
countries in economic shambles 
the worst offenders are the big nations who are unwilling or 
reluctant to change he said japan with huge trade surpluses 
from exports of industrial and consumer goods clings to import 
barriers on products such as beef rice and citrus 
other exporting countries including the eec say they are not 
alone in subsidizing agricultural trade and point to the export 
enhancement program operated by the us department of agriculture 
under eep as it is known private exporters are given surplus 
usdaowned commodities so they can sell grain or other products to 
selected foreign countries including the soviet union china and 
others department officials claim eep was necessary to compete 
with europes subsidized exports 
after lyng spoke to the farm editors his department routinely 
announced several more export subsidy actions under the program 
china was sold an additional 95000 tons of us wheat which 
carried subsidies of 2752 per ton 
another eep subsidy was for 300 tons of frozen broiler chickens 
or fryer legs sold to the canary islands the subsidies amounted to 
about 237 per ton officials said an additional 400 tons of frozen 
poultry are still available for sale to the canary islands at 
subsidized prices

a private contractor has helped farmers in 
five southwest kansas counties beat a federal deadline for 
conservation planning says the agriculture department 
wilson scaling chief of the departments soil conservation 
service said monday a consulting company john ho and associates 
inc dallas texas completed planning by midapril less than 
half the time called for in its oneyear contract 
the 1985 farm law gives farmers until dec 31 1989 to complete 
conservation plans for protecting highly erodible land scaling 
said district conservationists in kansas said they would not be 
able to help all the farmers with planning in time to meet the 
deadline 
one of the most successful ideas was to contract out the 
planning to a qualified private company he said 
kansas has the secondlargest amount of cropland of any state 
some 291 million acres he said of that the agency estimates 
more than onethird is highly erodible

a bill banning abortion which sponsors 
said was designed to force the us supreme court to reconsider a 
1973 decision fell just one vote short of passage in the arizona 
house 
supporters said they may attempt to revive the measure termed 
obviously unconstitutional by its opponents 
the house voted 3028 in favor of the bill one short of the 31 
needed for passage 
the supreme court legalized abortion with its landmark roe vs 
wade decision in 1973 backers of the arizona legislation which 
would have made abortion illegal except to save the life of the 
mother said they believed that the present supreme court might 
reverse the 1973 decision if given the chance to do so 
supporters of the bill said its passage would make arizona the 
first state to outlaw abortion since the supreme court decision 
noting how close they had come to getting the bill passed 
backers said they would consider bringing it back for another vote 
before the end of the current legislation session 
but even if it succeeds in the house the chances of the bills 
becoming law appeared to be slim 
gov rose mofford announced that she probably would veto it 
my impression is that its unconstitional mrs mofford 
said adding i cant legislate morality

belgians crave crawdads but have yet to sample 
catfish while saudi arabians find american rice so much to their 
liking that they package rice from thailand to make it look as if 
it came from here the department of agriculture says 
those are a few of the useful bits of knowledge for americans 
who want to export food products compiled by the department in a 
recent 204page book called trade policies and market 
opportunities for us farm exports it tells of quotas tariffs 
surcharges health and sanitary rules and other restrictions that 
plague american exporters to more than 100 countries 
the april issue of the departments magazine foreign 
agriculture gives an account of the report 
for example wine cant be advertised in norway and sweden 
governments there want to hold down drinking in france its 
margarine that cant be advertised because the government wants to 
protect french dairy farmers from competition on their sales of 
butter 
egypt wont buy almonds at all because its protecting its 
meager stock of foreign exchange india wont buy tallow for 
religious reasons the cows it is made from are sacred to hindus 
italy is said to know too little about american tallow to order it 
none of the 12 countries in the european community will buy 
foreign meat if its mixed with soy protein they say its to 
protect consumers 
theres no duty in austria on imports of that american rice the 
saudis like so much bahrain a saudi neighbor buys rice almost 
entirely from india and pakistan 
the book makes no judgment on whether the obstacles are fair or 
unfair an issue much discussed in congress during the current 
debate on the trade bill 
virtually every country provides support and protection to 
agriculture in some degree it explains in some cases this is 
done primarily through policies that raise prices to consumers by 
protecting the domestic market in other cases assistance is 
provided through subsidies financed by the taxpayer 
in some cases the countries do not believe that their actions 
constitute barriers in other cases the book implies that american 
producers could do more to sell their products under the heading 
reason for the barrier a frequent explanation is lack of 
awareness 
that is the cause it gives for low sales in japan not only of 
american catfish and crayfish which are lumped together but 
also grapefruit juice frozen potatoes wood panel products 
hardwoods from temperate climates and beer 
belgium is also noted as a country where lack of awareness of 
the american product keeps down the sale of catfish the book says 
nothing about the belgian appetite for crayfish which is 
considerable

saudi arabia on tuesday decided to sign 
the nuclear weapons nonproliferation treaty a strong indication 
it will not seek nuclear warheads for intermediaterange missiles 
it recently acquired from china 
the official saudi press agency reported that king fahd made the 
decision during a cabinet meeting in riyadh the saudi capital 
the meeting was called in response to a recommendation by prince 
saud alfaisal the saudi foreign minister that the kingdom sign 
the international treaty against the spread of nuclear arms 
an account of the cabinet discussions and decisions at the 
meeting which ended before dawn was issued by information 
minister ali alshaer and distributed by the agency the agency 
monitored in bahrain did not elaborate 
it appeared the timing of the decision was designed primarily to 
reassure the united states that the kingdom will not try to arm its 
css2 missiles with nuclear warheads the decision also was viewed 
as an attempt to blunt israels allegations that the missiles 
constituted a threat to its safety 
saudi arabia the middle east petroleum giant and the worlds 
largest exporter of crude oil was reported to have recently 
acquired from beijing an undisclosed number of css2 missiles 
capable of reaching virtually any point in the middle east 
including israel 
israel has voiced fears the saudis might be seeking to acquire 
nuclear warheads for the missiles and indicated it might deal a 
preemptive blow

a newly modified coast guard jet which has 
radar and infrared systems will enable pilots to lock onto and 
track suspected drug traffickers planes through clouds or darkness 
the first of a fleet of nine nighthawks as theyre nicknamed 
was dedicated at a ceremony monday in a hangar at national airport 
its a particularly bad day for those who would smuggle drugs 
into this country adm paul a yost commandant of the coast 
guard said at the dedication 
now that ive got these aircraft i say to the drug smugglers 
two things if youre in the business id look for other 
employment and you can run but you cant hide yost said 
the planes which will initially be based in miami and mobile 
ala are modified versions of the coast guards mediumrange 
surveillance jet the hu25a guardian built by falcon jet corp of 
little rock ark 
they have been equipped with a sensor system that combines the 
longrange radar used in the f16 fighter jet with a 
forwardlooking infrared or flir sensor 
previously coast guard planes were equipped with a radar system 
designed to track ships and no infrared at all said lt bob quirk 
the coast guard interceptor pilot who flew the first completed 
nighthawk to washington for the dedication 
before we did not have any altitude information on the 
target planes we did not have any closure speed information 
besides what we could judge with our eyeball quirk said 
this jet is twice as fast as any other coast guard plane 
said sen alfonse m damato rny who appeared at the 
dedication it can fly at 380 knots at 20000 feet above sea 
level for five hours up to 2045 miles 
transportation secretary james burnley who also participated in 
the ceremony said the united states is under siege by drug 
dealers 
when youre under attack by a formidable enemy youve got 
to have stateoftheart weaponry and youve got to have 
leadership he said 
the project which cost approximately 47 million for all nine 
jets including training for about 30 pilots was funded through the 
antidrug abuse act of 1986 
yost predicted that eventually all the planes would be based in 
miami to stem drug smuggling from the caribbean

a tug of war is under way in the senate as 
sponsors of a 1000page trade bill move to line up enough votes to 
show they could override a threatened presidential veto 
you let this bill go down the tubes and ill tell you where 
the champagne corks will be popping finance committee chairman 
lloyd bentsen dtexas told senators monday theyll be popping 
in japan and theyll be popping in germany 
the bill is expected to clear the senate with votes to spare 
but from there it heads for the white house and evidently a 
presidential veto 
the question is whether it will receives the twothirds support 
it would need to override a veto sponsors and the administration 
are looking for any wavering votes they can still find 
major provisions of the bill would streamline the system under 
which the united states imposes import curbs to punish 
international trade violations and aid industries threatened by 
foreign competition 
other provisions range from billions of dollars in new 
agricultural subsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil 
companies 
the administration has saved most of its fire lately for a 
provision that would require all but the smallest employers to give 
60day notice of plant closings and largescale layoffs 
the senate had been set to vote today but with neither side 
satisfied that it had done everything possible leaders said they 
might wait until wednesday 
as the showdown neared lawmakers and congressional staffers on 
both sides said the outcome appeared too close to call 
democrats were expected to vote for the bill overwhelmingly 
while republicans were divided on whether to stand by the reagan 
administration in hopes of getting a slimmeddown version later 
its close bentsen told reporters it was an uphill 
battle but now its a tossup 
the house approved the measure 312107 on thursday more than 
enough to override a veto 
i know this is an election year and the majority party may be 
looking for a campaign issue rather than a trade bill but i am 
confident the congress could pass a better bill if this one is 
rejected sen robert t stafford rvt said 
democratic leaders have been saying it would be tough to bring 
another trade bill onto the senate floor before congress leaves 
washington to campaign full time this fall 
for one thing they say bringing such a bill onto the senate 
floor without something like the year of committee consideration 
that shaped the current version could make the new one a target for 
an array of amendments that in themselves could torpedo the measure 
as dubious as they have been about a strippeddown trade bill 
however democratic leaders have left the door open a crack for 
such an effort if reagans veto is sustained 
one of the first items to go in any new bill could be the 
plantclosings provision 
business groups say it would dry up capital for investment and 
frighten off customers but it has strong backing from labor 
sen john c danforth rmo told the senate high officials 
of the administration had told him that portions of the bill 
are acceptable to the administration 
we pulled off the hat trick we pulled off the miracle 
danforth said the administration now says that while its not 
perfect it is something that the president would be willing to sign 
without plant closings

fish oil may help the thousands of patients 
each year who receive lifesaving organ transplants only to develop 
serious kidney disease from the toxic effects of a drug needed to 
prevent organ rejection a researcher says 
dr william m bennett said monday that three medical centers 
now are testing the use of fish oil to smooth out the harsh side 
effects of cyclosporine a drug taken by transplant patients to 
prevent organ rejection 
the beneficial effects of cyclosporine have made it possible for 
thousands to receive kidney heart and liver transplants the 
primary action of the drug is to supress the bodys immune response 
side effects of the drug however can be very serious for 
patients already in delicate health 
bennett speaking at a national kidney foundation seminar said 
virtually every patient who takes cyclosprine suffers some change 
in kidney function probably as the result of constricted flow 
through blood vessels of the kidney 
at least one heart transplant patient he said has survived the 
transplant operation only to suffer complete kidney failure due to 
the toxic effects of cyclosporine 
bennett a professor at the oregon health sciences university in 
portland said he and other researchers determined in laboratory 
studies that by mixing cyclosporine with a fish oil high in omega3 
fatty acid its bad side effects can be reduced without blocking the 
good results 
oil from fishes such as salmon and other cold water fish said 
bennett are known to reduce the formation of thromboxanes a 
protein that causes blood vessels to constrict in laboratory 
animals he said this effect of fish oil seems to counter kidney 
damage caused by cyclosporine 
a limited number of patients now are receiving the fish oil and 
cyclosporine at clinics in portland ore and boston he said 
bennett said if the toxic effects of cyclosporine can be 
countered successfully then there may be expanded uses for the 
drug use of cyclosporine has been suggested in such auto immune 
diseases as rheumatoid arthritis and some types of diabetes 
another researcher at the national kidney foundation seminar 
said extensive clinical trials are under way on a new 
geneticallyengineered hormone that will counter anemia among 
patients who must depend on artificial kidneys 
dr joseph w eschbach a professor at the university of 
washington in seattle said more than 100000 americans with failed 
kidneys are receiving dialysis a procedure that cleans the blood 
of impurities normally filtered out by the kidneys 
up to 75000 of these patients suffer from anemia characterized 
by a shortage in their blood of red cells which carry oxygen to 
the cells for about 25000 the problem is so serious that they 
must receive blood transfusions 
because of the anemia eschbach said that only about a third of 
the dialysis patients are able to return to work and many become 
part of the couch all they can do is just lie there 
the federal government spends about 2 billion a year caring for 
dialysis patients he said and some of this money could be saved 
if more patients were able to correct their anemia 
eschbach said research has shown that the reason for this anemia 
is that the failed kidneys no longer produce a hormone called 
erythropoietin in normal function the kidneys secrete this 
hormone when red cells are reduced in the blood the hormone goes 
to the bone marrow and causes blood formation tissue there to make 
more red blood cells 
scientists have now isolated the human gene that makes the 
hormone this gene has been inserted into the nucleus of chinese 
hamster ovary cells which now are producing large amounts of 
erythropoietin 
dialysis patients who have received erythropoietin injections 
said eschbach have recovered from their anemia and many have 
returned to work 
some have improved to the point that they have been able to 
receive kidney transplants and are no longer on dialysis he said 
the hormone now is in clinical trials and is expected to be 
available for general use by next spring

lawyers for oliver l north and his 
irancontra codefendants are on a collision course with the judge 
as they argue for dismissal of the case on grounds that evidence 
was gathered illegally 
a pretrial hearing monday began on a sour note for the defense 
team when us district judge gerhard a gesell ruled lawyers for 
north and two other defendants violated his ground rules for the 
hearing and would be barred from presenting any witnesses 
from that point the proceeding rolled downhill for the defense 
lawyers as gesell rebuffed their request to question the top 
prosecutors and grand jury witnesses about their exposure to 
testimony given to congress under a grant of immunity 
nor would gesell permit the defense to immediately review 
instructions given by independent counsel lawrence e walsh and his 
staff to grand jurors when they were advised in their secret 
proceedings to avoid news accounts of the congressional hearings 
i have a great sense of unfairness for my client complained 
north lawyer brendan v sullivan jr as the hearing dragged on 
gesell responded moments later i dont think lawyers should 
run the hearing i should 
nonetheless gesell made no final ruling on sullivans charge of 
enormous taint in the case and the judge scheduled another 
hearing for wednesday 
if gesell finds after that hearing questions remain about the 
validity of the prosecution evidence he can order further hearings 
on the subject that could push back the judges initial hope for a 
july trial date 
walsh is barred from using a witness immunized testimony to 
prosecute that witness except for perjury however the judge said 
it would still be possible to have a trial even if some evidence 
were obtained improperly because the tainted evidence and 
certain witnesses could be barred from the case 
three defendants testified before congress last summer under 
immunity grants north the former national security council 
staffer who directed the oncesecret operations that sent arms to 
iran and to the nicaraguan contra rebels when such assistance was 
prohibited by law his boss at the time national security adviser 
john m poindexter and businessman albert hakim who handled the 
millions of dollars in iran arms sales profits that were stashed in 
swiss bank accounts 
hakims partner retired air force maj gen richard v secord 
is the fourth defendant but his leadoff testimony at the 
congressional hearings was given without an immunity grant 
the defendants are charged with conspiring to use us arms 
sales profits illegally to aid the contras and to cover up their 
actions they also are accused of theft of government property 
obstruction of government inquiries making false statements and 
destruction of documents 
while mondays proceedings were under way defense lawyers filed 
a notice that they would appeal gesells pretrial rulings that 
went against them 
the judge had invited them to do so during the hearing saying 
the defense objections stand out like the statue of liberty 
go ahead and have your romp upstairs in the appeals court 
gesell said 
the only witness monday was walsh who testified about his 
repeated written and oral instructors to his staff to witnesses 
and to grand jurors to avoid being influenced by immunized 
testimony he said his evidence was gathered independently and 
filed weekly with the court 
walsh did admit however that one of his assistants 
christopher todd has voluntarily withdrawn from aspects of the 
case because of possible exposure to immunized testimony 
i dont know anything about the conditions that prompted 
todds decision walsh said he didnt want to taint me i dont 
know whether he was tainted or not 
sullivan hammered again and again at walshs admission that he 
didnt know whether everyone complied with his orders compliance 
walsh said sometimes required a degree of common sense 
the prosecutor sarcastically told sullivan there was no 
discussion of how quickly you could turn off the television if a 
report on the congressional hearings came on 
and when sullivan pointed out that comedy shows such as 
saturday night live made references to immunized testimony 
walsh said he had no idea whether those receiving his instructions 
turned off the programs 
but walsh said each of his assistants knows hes jeopardizing 
the investigation if hes careless 
herbert j stern a former federal judge and veteran prosecutor 
representing walsh on the immunity issue said he can show every 
bit of the evidence was independently derived 
the extensive procedures of insulation are just extras and are 
really not needed stern said

jesse jackson appears to be retaining the 
support of his most loyal constituencies the arabamericans 
despite upsetting many of them with comments about palestine 
liberation organization chief yasser arafat 
theres still a great deal of spirit out there for jesse 
especially after jackson modified his remarks on arafat said 
abdeen jabara president of the americanarab antidiscrimination 
committee 
arabamericans have contributed more than 400000 to jacksons 
1988 presidential campaign including some 90000 raised sunday at 
a private home in washington according to his key arab affairs 
adviser james zogby a handful of fundraising events are scheduled 
in coming weeks in california michigan pennsylvania new york and 
ohio 
one of jacksons most prominent arabamerican backers radio 
personality casey kasem is planning a big fundraiser in los 
angeles just before californias june 7 primary 
and there are 43 arabs and muslims running to be jackson 
delegates in california according to salam almarayati of the 
muslim political action committee in los angeles 
jackson appears to have assuaged the concerns of some arab 
supporters who were upset by his comment on cbstvs face the 
nation that as president he would not meet with arafat 
jabara accused jackson of caving in to jewish groups and 
said many members of his group were dismayed by the tv interview 
but the transcript of a subsequent interview that was printed in 
the new york times seemed to clear up any misunderstandings 
jabara said 
in that interview jackson pointed out there is a law which he 
said should be changed prohibiting us officials from talking to 
the plo because the plo does not recognize israel 
he said the plo is by far the most representative organization 
of the palestinian people and should be represented at the 
negotiating table 
the developments were important to many arabamericans who have 
long looked to jackson as their voice in the us political world 
jacksons relationship with the arabs goes back to 1979 when as 
a private but wellknown citizen he visited the middle east on a 
factfinding tour and was photographed embracing arafat 
that picture still angers many american jews but the arabs see 
jackson as a leader who is interested in the rights of their people 
as well as the security of israel 
for many years jackson has held that the us policy against 
negotiating with the plo is counterproductive 
his support for establishment of a palestinian homeland also has 
endeared him to the arabs but he also contends the arab states and 
palestinians must recognize israels right to exist 
during jacksons 1984 presidential campaign his arab ties 
created a stir when it was disclosed that his chicagobased civil 
rights organization had received 200000 from the arab league a 
group of arab governments 
the contributions to the educationoriented push for excellence 
and the push foundation caused controversy especially among jewish 
groups who contended jackson was too dependent on arab money 
zogby head of the arabamerican institute said arabamericans 
who number an estimated 2 million throughout the country mostly 
concentrated in about a dozen cities had achieved finanical and 
social security but felt excluded politically until jacksons 1984 
presidential race 
jackson brought them into the process and they dont forget 
that 
he acknowledged jacksons televised comments two weeks ago 
caused an initial round of concern 
but he said arab support again was pouring in by the time the 
new york campaign ended april 19 and new york mayor ed koch had 
savaged jackson as being antiisraeli 
after the face the nation interview some members of the 
national association of arabamericans raised questions said liela 
calnan new england coordinator for the group 
they didnt understand i know a few arabs in california that 
thought the would be turning against them she said 
but she said they were willing to give jackson another chance 
because of his record he defends palestinians constantly he 
never fails whether theres arabs there or not to mention 
palestinian self determination 
she said arabs would be unlikely to support dukakis because of 
his wife who is jewish 
jabara initially wrote a public letter to jackson accusing him 
of tailoring your positions to appease jewish voters before the 
new york primary 
jackson had said on face the nation that it would be a 
mistake to try and sit arafat at a negotiating table with israeli 
prime minister yitzhak shamir because that would be asking for a 
bonafide explosion 
asked if he himself would sit down with arafat he said i 
would not and its not necessary to do that we must not equate 
arafat an the plo with a sovereign people the palestinian people

jackson said referring to first lady nancy reagans advice that 
youngsters just say no to drugs

said 
following his address jackson met briefly with casey also a 
democrat who has not endorsed a presidential candidate

investing in america infrastructure investment programs and the 
war on drugs casey said 
reginald williams a hershey resident who attended the 
harrisburg rally said he was impressed with jacksons concern for 
all residents 
we have a chance to make history even if his nomination fails

lawyers for both pat robertson and the former 
congressman he sued for questioning his war record said they were 
pleased by an order that the former television evangelist pay 
28000 in court costs 
rep paul n pete mccloskey was sued in 1986 after he 
claimed that robertson had used the political influence of his late 
father sen a willis robertson dva to avoid combat duty 
during the korean war 
robertson dropped the lawsuit last month rather than go to trial 
on march 8 when he ran in republican primaries on super tuesday 
robertson officially remains a contender for the republican 
presidential nomination although george bush is expected to amass 
sufficient delegates to clinch the nomination in todays 
pennsylvania primary 
us district judge joyce hens green dismissed the lawsuit on 
the condition that robertson pay mccloskeys court costs because 
the former congressman is the prevailing party 
mccloskey had sought 42845 in court costs following the 
dismissal last month of robertsons 35 million libel action but 
the clerk of the us district court here rejected 14845 of that 
amount 
we are pleased that even at the clerk level it was knocked 
down substantially from 42000 down to 28000 said joel e 
leising one of robertsons attorneys 
mccloskeys lawyer george lehner said he was pleased with the 
award 
robertsons lawyers who had originally argued their client 
should only be assessed 6000 have five days to file further 
objections with the judge 
we will consider whether to seek a further reduction 
leising said noting that at some point the cost of legal fees 
in seeking a reduction might outweigh what we would get 
the clerk disallowed more than 7000 in fees for an expert 
witness mccloskey had hired to rebut robertsons claims that he 
suffered economic hardship as a result of the statements which 
were contained in a letter to rep andrew jacobs dind 
the letter was printed by several syndicated columnists 
prompting the libel suit

a lawyer awarded 21 million for four years 
of confinement and torture in argentine prisons during the military 
regime says hell donate half the money to other victims of human 
abuses there 
us district judge samuel conti on monday ordered former 
argentine gen carlos suarez mason who supervised the prisons to 
pay the money described by plaintiff lawyers as a record for human 
rights abuse cases settled in the united states 
on wednesday another federal judge is scheduled to decide 
whether suarez mason should be extradited to argentina on charges 
of 43 murders and 24 kidnappings allegedly committed by soldiers 
under his command 
its a tremendous victory both for human rights and for the 
people of argentina the victims and the families of the 
disappeared to whom a great portion of this award will be 
donated david cole an attorney for the new yorkbased center 
for constitutional rights said of mondays ruling 
coles client horacio martinezbaca a labor union lawyer and 
former government official in mendoza argentina said he was 
arrested in march 1976 six days after a military coup held for 
four years and tortured repeatedly in military prisons overseen by 
suarez mason 
they laid me down on a table martinezbaca who now lives 
in oakland testified last month they tied my arms and legs 
they put electric shocks on my genitals and my gums and they asked 
who were my friends 
he also described beatings freezing showers death threats and 
solitary confinement in an unheated windowless cell for days at a 
time 
he said 90minute torture sessions occurred about a month after 
he was arrested and repeated several times before his release in 
april 1980 
suarez mason whom prisoners referred to as the lord of death 
and life intervened personally in 1977 to block martinezbacas 
release from prison according to martinezbaca 
the judge on monday held suarez mason in default after he failed 
to respond to the lawsuit conti awarded martinezbaca 117 
million for lost income 10 million for pain and suffering and 10 
million as punitive damages 
martinezbaca agreed to give half the award to a fund for 
victims of rights abuses in argentina cole said plaintiffs in two 
other pending civil suits in san francisco that each seek 20 
million against suarez mason have made the same agreement 
the 64yearold defendant has insisted he spent his last 
100000 on lawyers in his extradition case and has no money left 
lawyers for martinezbaca however doubted that 
this is someone who is alleged to have taken many millions of 
dollars when he was in a position fo power in argentina said 
attorney joanne hoeper he paid his attorneys 100000 in wire 
transfers from argentina and were sure theres more where that 
came from 
the damages can be collected against suarez masons assets 
anywhere in the world 
suarez mason commanded the first army corps in buenos aires from 
1976 to 1979 he fled when a civilian government came to power in 
1983 and was arrested in january 1987 at his home in foster city 
south of san francisco 
an estimated 9000 to 20000 suspected leftist sympathizers 
vanished during the military regime from 1976 to 1983 
cole whose nonprofit legal organization has handled other 
human rights cases said the highest previous award was 104 
million in 1984 to relative of a youth who was tortured and 
murdered in paraguay the money was never paid because the 
defendant a police chief had no assests that could be collected

president reagan is extending economic 
sanctions against nicaragua over the objections of a group of 
democratic house members who say he should be helping the peace 
process rather than punishing nicaraguans 
the white house announced the move monday saying nicaraguas 
sandinista government still poses an unusual and extraordinary 
threat to the national security and foreign policy of the united 
states 
if reagan had not made the formal announcement of a oneyear 
extention with publication in the federal register the sanctions 
he imposed in 1985 would have lapsed on may 1 
reagan signed an executive order on may 1 1985 cutting off all 
trade with the central american country denying nicaraguan 
airliners and flag vessels access to the united states and ending a 
27year usnicaraguan friendship treaty reagan cited 
aggressive actions by nicaragua and its close military ties 
with cuba and the soviet union 
the united states however has maintained diplomatic relations 
with nicaragua while supporting contra forces trying to overthrow 
the government of president daniel ortega 
democratic reps mike lowry of washington nancy pelosi of 
california don bonker of washington and george crockett of 
michigan had been organizing an effort to lift the embargo 
gathering signatures for a letter to the president 
lowry said reagan should stop punishing the nicaraguan people 
and start pushing the peace process 
the nicaraguan embargo has worked against us interests from 
the beginning he said in a statement released by his office he 
said it has discouraged the private sector in nicaragua brought 
severe criticism from other latin american and western european 
countries harmed us business and labor interests and increased 
the suffering of innocent civilians in nicaragua 
lowry introduced legislation last week to lift the trade and 
other economic sanctions against nicaragua 
if the nicaraguan emergency were allowed to lapse reagans 
letter said the present nicaraguan trade controls would also 
lapse impairing our governments ability to apply economic 
pressure on the sandinista government and reducing the 
effectiveness of our support for the forces of the democratic 
opposition in nicaragua

house action has taken the united states on 
its way to becoming a full participant in international agreements 
aimed at preventing genocide 
by a voice vote the house on monday approved largely symbolic 
legislation setting stiff penalties for the crime of genocide the 
legislation which is backed by the reagan administration must 
also be ratified by the senate 
although the international convention on the prevention and 
punishment of the crime of genocide was adopted by the united 
nations general assembly and signed by the united states in 1948 
it was not ratified by the senate until 1986 
the international accords are aimed at preventing and punishing 
attempts to destroy in whole or in major part a national ethnic 
religious racial or religious group 
since the convention itself contains no mechanism to punish 
violators the nations which have signed and ratified it it are 
required to pass antigenocide laws 
reagan administration officials contend that full implementation 
of us participation in the genocide convention will remove an 
international human rights embarrassment 
a report on the bill issued by the house judiciary committee 
quoted assistant secretary of state richard schifter on the us 
position 
most of us will agree that genocide is not likely to take 
place within the borders of the united states schifter said 
our action on this convention is above all a symbolic act 
it underlines our role of leadership in the free world on 
behalf of the cause of human rights 
the bill sets prison sentences ranging from 20 years to life for 
people convicted of such offenses and sets fines of up to 1 
milliion 
it also provides for a prison term of up to five years and a 
fine of up to 500000 for people convicted of inciting others to 
undertake acts of genocide 
those penalties would apply to crimes of genocide committed by 
us nationals or which are committed within the united states 
the legislation also suspends the statute of limitations for 
prosecutions on allegations of genocide

when prime minister brian mulroney visits 
washington for his summit with president reagan hell be keeping 
an eye on the results of a provincial election back home 
mulroney who arrives in washington tonight is trying to decide 
soon when to call a federal election the choice of a new 
government today in manitoba a bluecollar industrial province in 
central canada may show the way 
manitoba has been controlled by the socialist new democratic 
party for 15 of the past 19 years but all polls indicate 
mulroneys progressive conservative party will win the election 
after narrowly losing to the socialists in 1986 
mulroney has 16 months to go in his fiveyear term but it is 
traditional for canadian leaders to set an early election date when 
political omens are favorable in a weekend interview mulroney 
said he wanted to clear his governments legislative agenda before 
calling a ballot 
that agenda includes ratification of a comprehensive free trade 
agreement negotiated with the united states last year passage of 
the meech lake constitutional accord recognizing quebec as a 
frenchspeaking distinct society a child day care program and 
the privatization of air canada 
the freetrade agreement will be discussed at the washington 
summit the us congress is expected vote on it this summer while 
the house of commons will consider legislation on the agreement 
next month 
recently mulroney has been making campaignlike stops around 
the country to test the political waters 
his 48hour washington visit includes a host of photo 
opportunities including a 19gun salute at the white house and 
separate meetings with reagan secretary of state george shultz 
vice president george bush and leaders of both the house and senate 
on wednesday afternoon he is to address both houses of congress 
a former lawyer and corporate executive from quebec mulroney 
49 has devoted much of his term to repairing canadaus relations 
strained under former liberal prime minister pierre trudeau 
despite reagans reluctance to clean up us smokestack 
emissions causing acid rain north of the border he and mulroney 
agree on key trade and defense issues according to white house 
officials reagan spends more time talking with mulroney on the 
telephone than any other world leader 
domestically mulroney has had a stormy time in office in spite 
of the 140seat majority he won four years ago in the 282member 
house of commons 
he has lost eight cabinet members in scandals ranging from a 
defense minister who visited a german strip club to a transport 
minister tried for fraud 
mulroney has shepherded canadas economy to the fastest growth 
among major industrialized countries with 4 percent inflation and 
unemployment at a 6year low of 78 percent now the conservatives 
are now neckandneck in the polls with the liberals and new 
democrats 
mulroney nevertheless has a credibility problem and is liked by 
only about onethird of the electorate according to polls 
in contrast new democratic party leader ed broadbent gets high 
marks as canadas most admired politician mulroney dubs his 
nemesis perfection personified 
i dont know if ill ever close in on perfection the prime 
minister said but i dont have to to win an election 
he said when the time comes voters will not take a chance by 
electing what would be the countrys first socialist government at 
a federal level 
broadbents vulnerable spot is his partys vow to pull canada 
out of the nato alliance and to renegotiate the norad air defense 
pact with the united states 
canada was a charter member of the north atlantic treaty 
organization and has 6900 troops stationed in west germany 
mulroney and reagan agreed in 1986 to renew the north american 
aerospace defense pact for five years protecting the continent 
against soviet attack over the north pole 
the new democrats would bring the troops home and cancel 
mulroneys 65 billion plan to acquire canadas first fleet of 
nuclearpowered submarines 
aware of the unpopularity of its nato pledge the new democratic 
party softened its stance this month by promising not to start the 
withdrawal in a first term 
mulroney ridiculed the change saying canadians would never 
support a policy that says were going to pull out of our most 
sovereign undertaking with regard to national defense but by the 
way were not going to do it right now

in the heat of the havana day la bodeguita 
del medio resembles the steamy cantinas of mexico with a bit of 
the big apple thrown in 
like new yorks cadillac bar the walls are covered with 
graffiti left by visitors who pack the cramped restaurant tucked 
along a side street of old havana like the cafes of tijuana a 
sweating chef stirs metal tubs of pork and beans swatting at an 
occasional fly and wiping his brow with a dishcloth 
but theres a difference here above the din of clattering 
plates and the strum of the strolling guitarist youre as apt to 
hear german italian french and english being spoken as you are to 
hear spanish its a sound the government loves to hear 
with its caribbean climate and calm beaches cuba is a natural 
lure for tourists before the revolution us visitors plunked 
down millions of dollars in the cabarets and casinos of havana 
the casinos are closed now and tourists from the united states 
vanished when relations soured between the two countries us 
tourists who spend money in cuba are subject to prosecution under 
the us trading with the enemy act 
the communist island nation largely dependent on soviet aid and 
sugar exports is making an allout effort to bring in money from 
elsewhere 
from the bustle of havana to the serene beaches of santiago de 
cuba the government is putting up new hotels and renovating old 
ones in hopes of making tourism its no 2 earner of hard currency 
after sugar by the year 2000 
numbers are hard to come by nobody at the national tourism 
institute intur would talk to an american reporter 
but inturs vice president orosman quintero recently told 
cuban reporters that in 1987 about 123000 people from canada 
spain italy west germany and mexico visited cuba that was an 
increase of 15 percent over 1986 
according to the magazine bohemia intur figures from 1986 
indicate that 155795 tourists visited cuba bringing in about 
973 million 
before the revolution tourism brought in about 400 million 
annually 
the canadian tourism season runs from december through the end 
of march but a few could still be found lounging in the 85 degree 
sun last week at santa maria del mar a seaside resort 20 miles 
outside havana 
adelaide and tony aloi of toronto said they paid 1000 each for 
two weeks in santa maria including breakfast and dinner in their 
hotel and roundtrip airfare like others interviewed they praised 
beaches weather cuban hospitality and the feeling of security 
mexicos cheap but you have to bargain your way through it 
said aloi here theres nobody coming up to you on the street 
trying to sell things or get money 
but they agreed with other tourists who complained about bad 
hotel food the poor quality of consumer goods and hotel service

michael dukakis won the utah presidential 
caucuses on monday overwhelming rival jesse jackson and capturing 
most of the states 23 delegates to the democratic national 
convention 
with 46 percent of the states 75 legislative districts 
reporting dukakis had 4104 votes for 71 percent to jacksons 
1080 or 19 percent while 538 voters or 9 percent were 
uncommitted 
based on these returns dukakis would win 18 national convention 
delegates and jackson would win five 
the combined votes for democrats paul simon richard gephardt 
and albert gore jr totaled 1 percent 
the percentage of votes determines how many of the states 23 
delegates each candidate receives the delegates will not be 
elected until the state convention in june 
complete statewide returns were not expected until early tuesday 
from the balloting in separate caucus meetings held in nearly all 
of the states 1807 voting districts 
although a victory here would reap only a handful of delegates 
dukakis aides said it would give the massachusetts governor 
momentum heading into tuesdays pennsylvania primary 
while democrats declared their presidential preference 
republicans were attending their own caucus meetings to vote their 
preference for vice president and to say whether they want a 
western states regional primary similar to the souths super 
tuesday contests on march 8 
republicans had planned a nonbinding presidential preference 
vote but scrapped the idea after vice president george bush 
virtually wrapped up the nomination 
utah will send 28 delegates to the democratic national 
convention including five super delegates chosen as a result 
of present or past party office 
three of the superdelegates national committeewoman norma 
matheson rep wayne owens and state party chairman randy horiuchi 
have endorsed dukakis the other two are uncommitted 
dukakis also has the endorsement of mathesons husband former 
democratic gov scott matheson 
none of the candidates has visited utah personally but the 
dukakis campaign has maintained the strongest presence with a 
fulltime staff 
support for jackson is more difficult to gauge two es here are picking 
up momentum jackson will 
pick up some delegates horiuchi predicted 
traditionally between 8 percent and 12 percent of registered 
voters attend the utah caucuses

michael dukakis and jesse jackson differed 
monday over whether any concessions should be made to terrorists 
holding americans hostage while a new survey said dukakis appeared 
headed for another bigstate presidential primary victory in 
pennsylvania 
you never make concessions to terrorists ever dukakis 
told reporters during a final campaign swing across the state 
before tuesdays primary 
jackson rejected what he called material concessions to 
terrorists but did not rule out political accommodation he also 
said he could conceive of situations where he would grant safe 
passage to hostagetakers and added i choose negotiation over 
blind bloody confrontation 
if we are going to deter terrorism we must address the 
underlying causes of terrorism he said after an appearance at a 
high school in pittsburgh terrorism does not emerge out of the 
blue 
the candidates agreed that in hostage situations the government 
ought to talk to people who could bring about the release of 
persons being held 
us policy holds that american officials will talk to any 
official or group about the safety and release of hostages but we 
will not make concessions according to the state department 
but jackson insisted the fact is tha our government has 
talked with terrorists and has negotiated in some instances 
successfully it is good as a policy but there must be always 
flexibility in the policy we ought to take every initiative we 
can to gain the freedom of the american hostages in beirut 
eight americans are held hostage by moslem extremists in beirut 
the discussion of tactics for dealing with terrorists was an 
abrupt shift in a campaign debate which had been focused on 
economic issues particularly how to assist pennsylvanias ailing 
steel industry 
jackson wound up his pennsylvania campaign in philadelphia where 
he spoke to striking workers at a british petroleum corp refinery 
attended a reception with gay and lesbian activists and then held a 
getoutthevote rally 
at the refinery he said the companys profits were up 400 
percent last year 
for profits to be up and wages down is greedy and unfair he 
said 
he also linked the welfare of american workers to the status of 
blacks in south africa 
steelworkers in pennsylvania are in danger as long as 
ironworkers in south africa are enslaved he said referring to 
imprisoned south african black leader nelson mandela jackson said 
until mandela is free you will not be free 
dukakis was aiming for his fourth straight primary victory in a 
contest with 178 delegates at stake 
vice president george bush who could clinch a convention 
majority with a victory in pennsylvania compared his campaign 
rebirth after an iowa caucus defeat to the revival of pittsburgh a 
oncestrapped steel town 
i know what its like to be knocked to the canvas he said 
adding that his political comeback was a parallel to what you 
demonstrated here 
the latest associated press delegate count gave bush 1081 58 
short of the 1139 needed for the nomination at the gop convention 
next august his only remaining rival former television evangelist 
pat robertson has 31 delegates 
on the democratic side dukakis was more than half way toward a 
delegate majority holding 107515 national convention votes 
jackson has 8361 while 59975 were uncommitted a tally of 2081 
or more is needed to win the nomination at the july convention in 
atlanta 
dukakis strong victory in the new york primary last week made 
him the prohibitive favorite to emerge as the democratic 
presidential nominee 
a new poll sponsored by philadelphias kywtv and pittsburghs 
kdkatv indicated a big dukakis win here with the massachusetts 
governor the choice of 57 percent of the likely democratic voters 
surveyed compared to 31 percent for jackson 
dukakis meanwhile won a large majority of the 23 delegates at 
stake in caucuses monday night in utah with 46 percent of the 
states legislative districts reporting dukakis had 71 percent of 
the vote to jacksons 19 percent 
the flap over how to deal with terrorists began on sunday when 
jackson took issue with dukakis position 
ive raised the point in several debates this year said 
jackson every time a question comes up about terrorism mr 
dukakis says im against terrorism we should not negotiate 
with terrorists in the middle east never negotiate with 
terrorists 
i disagree with that if i could get the hostages out id do 
it 
when dukakis was asked monday about the jackson statement he 
said i think we need a tough antiterrorist policy 
i dont have a problem with talking but you never make 
concessions to terrorists ever if you do what you end up with 
is hostagetaking and terrorism all over the world 
jackson said that as president he would not talk directly to 
terrorists because it would effectively raise the status of the 
terrorists and that would be a stimulus and that should not 
happen 
he went on to say that talk does not mean material 
concessions 
he said i would never never exchange arms for hostages a 
reference to the secret arms sales to iran by the reagan 
administration that was a fundamental mistake 
asked what he meant by material concessions jackson said 
well youre giving something physical the first principle is 
that we should not jeopardize our national interests or national 
security 
pressed on whether he would exchange political prisoners for 
hostages jackson said well the other government must make that 
judgment they must weigh their political circumstances they must 
determine the consequences of such an act every plea bargain 
situation or right of safe passage situation must be weighed on its 
own merits 
meanwhile a gallup poll released monday evening had bush and 
dukakis virtually tied in a headtohead race with bush doing 
better with the addition of rep jack kemp as a running mate and 
dukakis a bit worse if he ran with jackson 
bush had 45 percent support to 43 percent for dukakis with 12 
percent undecided or favoring someone else a bushkemp ticket won 
the support of 50 percent against 40 percent for a dukakisjackson 
ticket with 10 percent in the otherundecided category 
with jackson as the democratic presidential nominee the result 
was bush 60 percent jackson 25 otherundecided 15 gallup 
surveyed 1204 registered voters april 2123 the poll had a margin 
of sampling error of 3 points 
among the 540 democrats and democraticleaning independents in 
the poll 66 percent favored dukakis as the partys nominee to 22 
percent who wanted jackson and 12 percent otherundecided about 
twothirds of jacksons support was strong compared to onethird 
of dukakis support

staffers in 1988 to better serve the aps 1423 newspaper members

the bulk of these will go to our line bureaus whose state and 
regional news coverage is so important to you he told the 
members with membership increasing as it has the demands on our 
state bureaus are increasing and we must meet those needs 
the worldwide news cooperative is about to move from a speed of 
about 1050 words a minute to about 9000 on its datastream and 
datafeature wires datastream is the ap highspeed news wire 
datafeature is a separate service that delivers supplemental and 
syndicate copy to member newspapers throughout the system 
for newspapers with systems that need slower speeds the 
delivery can be reduced but the higher capacity will avoid 
crowding that can slow the delivery of copy much like traffic 
clogs a highway 
we are raising the speed limit from 55 miles per hour to 440 
miles per hour and if that werent enough were widening the ap 
interstate from four lanes to eight boccardi said

annual convention of the american newspaper publishers association 
the financier and philanthropist told the more than 1500 people 
at the luncheon that business leaders not politicians hold much 
of the blame for the united states declining status in the world 
since the us economy depends on taxpaying workers business 
leaders should work harder to create more jobs perot said 
perot said other countries especially in the asiapacific 
region are outpacing the united states in education trade and 
technology 
he said that before the federal government can cure the huge 
budget deficit individual americans must learn not to spend more 
than they earn 
the greatest nation in the history of civilization has given 
up trying to live within its means he said we and not the 
elected officials are the dwarfs and the wimps

of attending school before he dies of aids he began his first day

hour he spent in the classroom asked whether his first day was as 
much fun as he expected he replied yeah 
shiela said her sons biggest dream has been to attend school 
before he dies 
he used to talk about dying all the time and he said he wanted 
to die she said as jonathan watched ants inching along the 
sidewalk but he hasnt addressed it since he found out he would 
get to go to school he hasnt mentioned it in the last couple of 
weeks 
as his mother talked with reporters jonathan showed off a 
polaroid picture of himself at school at one point he walked away 
to play on the sidewalk unhooking the tube that connected him with 
the oxygen tank 
jonathans hopes of going to school were blocked several times 
in the past year by one delay after another earlier this month a 
tutor assigned by the school district to teach him at home demanded 
to be reassigned threatening to file a lawsuit if forced to 
continue the tutoring the request was granted 
school officials decided april 19 to allow jonathan to attend 
class

disease said his mother the youngster contracted aids from 
tainted blood he received in a transfusion shortly after birth and 
was diagnosed in june 1985

didnt it really rips your heart out but i think in a way hes 
comforting me by telling me its all right with him he was 
diagnosed three years ago and its just a matter of time 
pam mills executive director of exceptional students services 
for jefferson county schools also attended the news conference and 
said she was unaware of any parents who had kept their children at 
home because of jonathan there were no protesters or parents 
outside the school monday

news coverage of the soviet union is more 
difficult now because there is more activity and thus more news to 
report according to michael putzel the associated press bureau 
chief in moscow 
now we cover dissident news conferences official news 
conferences and demonstrations he said we are getting a lot 
more information 
for soviet reporters its a whole new ballgame putzel 
said they now have to firgure out whats expected of them and 
how far they can and want to go 
putzel and four other ap correspondents and news executives 
discussed reporting conditions and press freedoms among other 
topics during a conversation with ap president louis d boccardi 
at the associated press annual meeting here monday 
the press is one of the most distinct areas of liberalization in 
south korea said barry renfrew ap chief of bureau in seoul 
the press is able to moderately criticize the government 
now he said 
there has been a change from direct intimidation to more 
subtle influence he said 
current riots in the west bank and gaza strip have posed 
difficult problems for the israeli government which is a democracy 
and prides itself on being one said nick tatro the wire 
services bureau chief in jerusalem 
the government has not used military censorship but has tried to 
close off stories by putting curfews on towns or declaring military 
areas closed he said 
bryna brennan central america correspondent for the ap noted 
the reopening of la prensa a newspaper in managua nicaragua last 
fall 
la prensa has published consistently since october except for 
a brief week at easter when they ran out of newsprint she said 
it is a very strong opposition newspaper 
terence hunt the aps chief white house correspondent said he 
has the same difficulties in getting access to people he needs to 
talk with as the foreign correspondents do 
we only have access to our own booth and to white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwaters office where the door is usually 
closed hunt said 
we cant get to the oval office or white house chief of 
staff howard bakers office or the senior staff without an 
appointment he said 
its almost impossible on a spot story to get a call through 
for comment he said we have better luck talking to people on 
capitol hill because the white house staff briefs congressional 
leaders on major issues

us and filipino negotiators today 
discussed aids and procedures for trying american troops in 
criminal cases 
the discussion occurred during talks on us military bases 
which sources described as difficult and emotional the senate is 
debating a bill to ban nuclear weapons in the philippines and to 
prohibit nuclearcapable military ships from making port calls the 
measure is directed at us military bases 
in another development at least seven people were killed today 
on mactan island during a gun battle between government troops and 
scout rangers who deserted their unit three of the dead were scout 
rangers and four were government soldiers officials said radio 
stations said a civilian also died 
also today officials said communist rebels were suspected in 
the killings of a police captain and an anticommunist vigilante in 
two separate attacks near the usrun clark air base 
after their discussion today the us and filipino negotiators 
released a joint statement saying they had discussed the criminal 
jurisdiction issue and that the philippine side presented its 
proposal on purchases of locally manufactured products and 
socioeconomic issues 
there was no elaboration but sources familiar with the talks 
said the socioeconomic issues referred to allegations that 
us troops had brought the deadly aids virus into the country 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the talks 
were difficult and emotional 
at least 50 filipino prostitutes have been found carrying the 
aids virus but none has developed symptoms of the disease which is 
transmitted primarily through sexual intercourse or contaminated 
needles and blood products 
most of those found with the virus work in bars near the 
usrun clark air base and the subic bay naval base us 
authorities have promised not to transfer troops carrying the virus 
to the philippines 
filipino officials have suggested that the united states finance 
health and rehabilitation programs for aidsinfected prostitutes 
working near the bases 
the current bases agreement exempts american servicemen from 
trial by filipino courts if they allegedly commit crimes while on 
duty sources said filipino negotiators believe american commanders 
issue duty certificates to their troops too freely in a bid to 
exempt them from trial by local courts 
on april 5 the two sides began a periodic review of the 1947 
agreement under which the united states maintains six military 
bases in the philippines 
the outcome is expected to influence manilas decision whether 
to allow the bases to remain after their lease expires in 1991 but 
the talks are taking place amid growing calls for closing the 
bases which many filipinos see as a vestige of us colonial rule 
president corazon aquino has promised to honor the agreement but 
refuses to say whether she will support an extension 
under the new filipino constitution any extension must be 
approved by twothirds of the 23member senate where opposition to 
the bases is strong 
on monday the senate began debate on a bill to ban nuclear 
weapons and nuclearpowered ships from the philippines us 
officials say about 40 percent of the warships that call at subic 
bay are nuclear powered 
the bills sponsors say it is directed at the american bases 
us officials refuse to say whether nuclear weapons are stored in 
the phillipines 
officials said the battle between government troops and scout 
rangers began when the rangers attacked a checkpoint set up to

bob and anita van housen were looking for 
someplace peaceful to spend their retirement when they moved to 
this rural southern oregon community two years ago from southern 
california 
instead they find themselves fighting to keep a california 
rapist who cut off the forearms of his victim from becoming their 
neighbor 
unless youve got a gun or a large dog youre very 
vulnerable said mrs van housen president of the cow creek 
homeowners association as she petted her doberman we have a gun 
and a good watchdog 
the object of their fear is lawrence singleton 
the 60yearold former merchant marine became a free man monday 
after serving eight years in prison and one year of parole for 
raping and mutilating a 15yearold girl he picked up hitchhiking 
in berkeley calif then leaving her for dead outside modesto 
though his whereabouts remain unknown since his release 
singleton has said he wants to visit relatives in florida then 
come to azalea to live with members of a fundamentalist communal 
sect called the bride of christ 
angry protests followed singleton from town to town last year 
when california officials tried to place him on parole he was 
finally put in a small trailer on the grounds of san quentin prison 
to complete his parole 
bride of christ leader pastor thomas clyde smith jr offered 
singleton a home in this tiny rural community of about 750 people 
mostly millworkers loggers retirees and some ranchers 
since then smith says he and his followers have received death 
threats and shots have been fired at their homes 
i would like to see them hug each other smith said of 
singleton and his victim mary vincent who has been reported 
living somewhere in southern oregon it takes two people to heal 
a situation 
i know in this environment where we live singleton will have 
an opportunity to see love smith added maybe he has never 
seen it i know i didnt until i got saved 
smith was convicted of sexually abusing one of his daughters in 
1965 and has been a controversial figure in azalea since he and 
his 60 followers moved here four years ago from las vegas nev 
this isnt your little white church mrs van housen said 
nobody in this community belongs to that church its a closed 
church 
though the state attorney generals office says it can do 
nothing to stop singleton from moving to oregon rep denny smith 
rore sent a letter this week to residents here urging them to 
attend a meeting saturday in the grange hall smith is the sponsor 
of a state initiative to keep repeat offenders in prison for their 
full terms 
the reason he chose your town no doubt has a lot to do with 
how attractive oregon is to career criminals the congressman 
wrote 
mrs van housen said she is particularly afraid for azaleas 
children 
the man obviously has to live somewhere but geographically 
this isnt the place she said pointing to the thick forests 
surrounding the community i know people who live in this area 
and they have children who get off the school bus and walk a mile 
through these woods 
minister smith said the children in his church are eager to meet 
singleton 
in our church we dont teach fear to our children he said 
we want to show him love 
the tension has prompted the douglas county sheriffs department 
to increase patrols through azalea 
even if singleton did not show that would not belay the 
feelings down there toward smith for making this invitation to 
start with said undersheriff ray duncan that one will be a 
long time going away if it ever does

king fahd of saudi arabia today decided 
to sign an international treaty limiting the spread of nuclear 
arms apparently responding to israeli fears that the kingdom might 
arm its missiles with nuclear warheads 
information minister ali alshaer said the decision was made 
during a cabinet meeting in the saudi capital of riyahd where other 
issues also were discussed the official saudi press agency 
reported 
it appeared the announcement was designed primarily to reassure 
the united states that saudi arabia will not try to put nuclear 
warheads on css2 intermediaterange missiles the kingdom acquired 
from china 
king fahd wrote president reagan recently reportedly assuring 
him that the warheads on the surfacetosurface missiles are not 
nuclear 
israel has alleged that the missiles constitute a threat to its 
safety and indicated it might deal a preemptive strike to destroy 
them 
the news agency monitored in bahrain said prince saud faisal 
the saudi foreign minister recommended that the kingdom join the 
international nuclear weapons nonproliferation treaty 
saudi arabia the worlds largest exporter of crude oil was 
reported to have obtained from beijing an undisclosed number of 
css2 missiles capable of reaching virtually any point in the 
middle east including israel 
western diplomatic sources have said that china which arms its 
own css2s with atomic warheads has told washington it will not 
export nuclear arms 
the sources said the saudis refused a request by the united 
states to inspect the missiles which they said were deployed in 
the rub alkhali desert south of riyadh 
saudi sources said prince sultan the defense minister 
approached beijing for the css2s mainly because of us 
congressional obstruction of reagans approval of the sale of 
certain types of weapons to the kingdom they complained that 
congress has been bending to powerful israeli lobbying against us 
arms sale to saudi arabia 
the saudis feel threatened by iran which in 1984 began using 
intermediaterange missiles against its persian gulf war foe iraq 
saudiiranian relations hit their lowest point in july when 
hundreds of iranian pilgrims tried to defy a ban on political 
rallies and were killed in clashes with saudi riot police in mecca 
during the annual pilgrimage season 
gulfbased arab diplomatic sources have said the saudis want the 
css2s as a potential deterrent to iran whose leadership has urged 
the overthrow of the saudi royal family 
the united states the soviet union and britain were the major 
signers when the nuclear nonproliferation treaty was adopted in 
1968 in subsequent years the treaty was signed by scores of other 
nations 
the treaty is aimed at restricting the spread of military 
nuclear technology it calls for nuclear powers to abstain from 
assisting nonnuclear nations in obtaining or making nuclear 
weapons

cartoonist garry trudeau told a convention of 
newspaper publishers he does not object to newspapers editing his 
often controversial doonesbury strip 
but he added the country seems more intolerant of free 
expression than three years ago 
trudeaus strip runs in about 900 newspapers he won a pulitzer 
prize for editorial cartooning in 1975 becoming the first 
comicstrip artist ever to do so 
editors have the right and the responsibility to cut material 
they think is inappropriate for their readership he said monday 
as you know its called editing and those who call it 
censorship are either careless or ignorant trudeau told about 
2000 people attending the 102nd annual convention of the american 
newspaper publishers association 
but he said those who use the rationale that doonesbury is 
biased and unfair as the reason for pulling the strip are missing 
the point 
satire is supposed to be unbalanced its supposed to be 
unfair he said criticizing a political satirist for being 
unfair is like criticizing a 260pound noseguard for being physical 
were all up against a very dangerous trend of intolerance 
towards free expression he said indeed if doonesbury has 
sometimes seemed too pungent to some of you it may be because it 
appeared in an environment unfriendly to critical comment a time 
when impertinent questions are unwelcome 
before trudeaus speech george w wilson the chairman of the 
anpa and president of the concord nh monitor delivered the 
first keynote address of the threeday convention 
wilson said the industry needs to be more vigorous in its hiring 
of minority journalists 
our staffs must reflect the diversity of our society and our 
newspapers must faithfully mirror the world around us because we 
are a unique business with extraordinary responsibilities wilson 
said 
besides staff diversity and editorial excellence the future of 
the industry depends on technological research and development he 
said 
either technological developments will catch us unprepared 
and we can pray others are similarly surprised or we can 
stimulate and shape technological developments to serve our 
needs he said 
the conventions first panel discussion featured trade experts 
who touched upon among other things the omnibus trade bill before 
the senate and the effect of foreign investment in the united 
states 
the bill which president reagan has promised to veto could be 
revised easily to his liking with its major provisions intact said 
susan liebeler chairwoman of the us international trade 
commission 
i think youre a bit premature in calling in the undertaker 
she told fellow panelists discussing the bill 
the bill passed the house 312107 last week and is to be voted 
on by the senate this week 
reagan especially objects to a provision requiring most 
manufacturers to give 60 days notice of plant closings and major 
layoffs 
liebeler said she thought that reagan would veto the bill and 
that in a revised version the notification provision would be 
dropped and the bill approved 
more than 2000 people including about 1500 publishers who 
represent 90 percent of the daily newspaper circulation in the 
united states are attending the convention 
todays activities feature a panel discussion on the status of 
minority journalists and a speech by joseph clark principal of 
eastside high school in paterson nj senior nbc news commentator 
john chancellor is to give a luncheon address 
on wednesday the anpa will conduct its annual business meeting 
including the election of its officers and directors

record high 
it was a typical firstdayofthemonth pattern said a

first day of the month he added so share prices usually jump 
up in early morning and then profittaking usually press it down a 
bit 
shares traded tuesday will go into the may account 
the trader added that the general trend is still upward but 
investors took waitandsee attitude tuesday ahead of the

able to go anywhere from there unless some influencing factors 
emerge said hiroaki shukuzawa of sumitomo bank at this point 
12455 12470 yen seems to be the neutral range 
shukuzawa a currency dealer at one of the largest bank in

prime minister yitzhak shamir today praised a 
court for sentencing john demjanjuk to death for nazi war crimes 
all of us are proud that a jewish tribunal in the jewish state 
has judged and condemned one of the cruelest war criminals who 
murdered many of our jewish brethren and relatives shamir said 
in a speech at a jerusalem hotel 
the polishborn shamir lost relatives in the holocaust 
also today an official at the prison where demjanjuk was held 
said guards were ordered to watch the former ohio autoworker to 
prevent him from committing suicide demjanjuks son john jr said 
the precautions were crazy 
demjanjuk 68 was returned to his solitary confinement cell in 
the maximumsecurity ayalon prison near tel aviv on monday after 
receiving the death penalty for sending hundreds of thousands of 
jews to their deaths in world war ii as a brutal nazi guard called 
ivan the terrible 
since returning to prison he has been placed under 24hour 
guard and we are asking his guards to be more careful more 
alert said johnny tester spokesman for the israel prison 
service we want to be prepared 
john jr told the associated press the prisons precautions had 
no basis in fact its crazy theyre going to pop up with that 
kind of stupid propaganda to try to make it seem hes showed signs 
hes going to kill himself out of remorse or guilt 
my father would never attempt something like that because hes 
innocent and hell fight this to the last minute ive visited my 
dad and i know what frame of mind hes in john jr said 
the ukrainianborn demjanjuk of cleveland has insisted he is a 
victim of mistaken identity and plans to appeal his conviction to 
israels supreme court 
john jr 22 said the defense would not file an appeal for 
several weeks until after the family returns home to map out an 
appeal strategy 
he also said the family would hire a new lawyer to help prepare 
the appeal in addition to the current defense team of john gill of 
cleveland paul chumak of toronto and israeli attorney yoram 
sheftel 
according to israeli law a conviction with a death sentence 
must be appealed to the supreme court 
the last person to be executed in israel was nazi war criminal 
adolf eichmann who was hanged in 1962 israeli court officials 
have said demjanjuk would likely be hanged if his conviction is 
upheld on appeal 
tester said there were no gallows in israel and that if the 
appeal is denied we will have to build one 
some israelis saw the 14month trial as a crucial opportunity to 
educate the younger generation and remind the world of the horrors 
of the holocaust 
the personal fate of john demjanjuk isnt important or very 
interesting yosef lapid an israeli commentator and holocaust 
survivor said on israel radio the importance of the trial 
was to remind us of the holocaust for most of humanity the 
holocaust is cloudy history 
but comparing demjanjuks trial with proceedings against 
eichmann 26 years ago lapid said the eichmann trial was a 
national catharsis for israelis the demjanjuk trial leaves us in 
depression 
the banality of demjanjuk is more frightening than any 
evil lapid said if this guy could be like that then there 
are millions more like him

a woman accused of killing her husband and 
another person discussed killing him with drug overdoses months 
before he died from cyanidetainted aspirin her daughter testified 
at the producttampering trial 
cindy hamilton 28 told a federal court jury monday that a 
discontented stella nickell briefly mentioned divorcing bruce 
nickell but she said she was not going to lose half of everything 
she had fought so hard to get 
based on what my mother had told me prior to my dads death i 
believed that she did it ms hamilton said in a packed us 
district court courtroom 
her testimony was to continue today in the trial now in its 
second week 
on monday ms hamilton said her mother had questioned her about 
such drugs as heroin cocaine and amphetamines where they could be 
obtained and how much would cause an overdose 
assistant us attorney joanne maida asked ms hamilton whether 
her mother ever discussed specific people in the conversations 
my dad bruce nickell she replied referring to her 
stepfather 
prosecutors say mrs nickell the first person in the united 
states to be tried on charges of causing death by tampering with 
overthecounter capsules plotted to kill nickell to collect 
insurance 
but prosecutors said the plot unraveled when ms hamilton 
challenged her mothers attempt to make his june 1986 death and 
that of susan katherine snow a few weeks later look like random 
murders prosecutors have suggested there were no links between the 
victims other than the way they died 
government investigators also found mrs nickells fingerprints 
in library books about poisons and that at least one insurance 
policy had been forged prosecutors say 
she was very discontent with him ms hamilton said she 
was grateful he stopped drinking but she was discontent they 
never did anything nickell was a reformed alcoholic she said 
ms hamilton spoke softly but occasionally was choked by tears 
she never looked at her mother mrs nickell rarely took her eyes 
from her daughter 
when mrs nickell told her daughter in june 1986 that nickell 
was dead she looked at me and said i know what you are 
thinking and the answers no ms hamilton testified 
ms hamilton failed to reveal her suspicions to fbi agents in 
interviews shortly after the deaths saying she was scared for 
her and i guess to protect her 
ms hamilton finally went to officials in january 1987 
mrs nickell is charged in the deaths of nickell 52 and of ms 
snow 40 who died after ingesting poisoned capsules of 
extrastrength excedrin 
mrs nickell also faces three counts of tampering with a product 
involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in two 
extrastrength excedrin bottles and an anacin3 bottle recovered 
from stores in two seattle suburbs 
the defense earlier challenged ms hamiltons credibility 
saying she had a history of drug abuse and was motivated to contact 
the fbi by a 300000 reward established by a pharmaceutical group 
a niece wilma stewart testified earlier monday that mrs 
nickell seemed irked at everything a month before the cyanide 
deaths but never mentioned harming her husband 
asked whether mrs nickell had indicated an intent to kill ms 
stewart replied absolutely not not ever 
prosecutors say the nickells marriage was unhappy and that 
mrs nickell was determined not to lose her trailer home in a 
divorce witnesses have testified that the nickells were several 
thousand dollars in debt when nickell died

south koreans expressed hope that 
todays legislative elections would help promote democracy but 
many also said violent protests could result if widespread vote 
fraud occurs 
a lot of problems have surfaced but from a longterm point of 
view i think the elections would be a step forward toward 
democracy kim soonim 43 a housewife in seoul said 
many voters interviewed shared that view but expressed concern 
that widespread corruption would heighten political instability 
before the olympic games opening sept 17 in seoul 
i am afraid the elections would cause new problems rather than 
solve them kang hanik 21 a college student said kang and 
many others predicted a flood of lawsuits disputing results of this 
election which follows the first direct presidential election in 
16 years 
in the presidential voting in december roh taewoo of the 
governing democratic justice party won with 36 percent of the vote 
but opposition charges of rigging in that election won little 
support from the public irritated by the oppositions inability to 
unite 
violence corrupt campaigning and the alleged use of government 
influence to help governing party candidates became issues again in 
this campaign 
since the official 18day campaign began no day passed without 
reports of scuffles among rival party supporters firebomb attacks 
on candidates or party offices and other violence scores were 
injured although exact figures were not available and 150 people 
were reported detained by police 
many people interviewed said they were most concerned by reports 
of widespread efforts to buy votes with meals gifts and cash the 
governing democratic justice party announced it was expelling one 
candidate after authorities reported finding thousands of 
envelopes each stuffed with the equivalent of 30 in cash ready 
for mailing at a post office 
i did not receive cash but got a case of soap lee 
chungkil 34 a taxidriver said people say that only fools 
would not get gifts in that sense i am not a fool 
a housewife in a relatively wealthy residential area in seoul 
said it was difficult to reject offers of free lunches or dinners 
made through personal friends associated with certain candidates 
i had received at least 10 offers of free sumptuous meals i 
have a guilty feeling for not voting for any of the candidates who 
provided the meals she said speaking on condition of anonymity

contra leaders met secretly with a top sandinista 
official to plan this weeks round of peace talks in nicaragua but 
one rebel threatened to scrap the talks unless us aid is allowed 
to reach the guerrillas 
contra leader adolfo calero said monday the truce arrangement 
reached last month in sapoa nicaragua would be in danger if the 
leftist sandinista government continued to block food and medical 
supplies to rebel troops inside the central american country 
the question of humanitarian aid to the troops will have to be a 
top issue at highlevel talks planned thursday in managua calero 
said 
we must reach an agreement on that he said if that is 
not done the whole sapoa agreement will collapse 
sandinista deputy foreign minister victor tinoco met with a 
contra official to set the agenda and arrangments for the 
talks calero confirmed monday 
tinoco previously accused the contras of engaging in political 
maneuvering to avoid a definitive ceasefire while they freely 
receive us humanitarian aid 
the contras have three private us companies available to rush 
the supplies to nicaragua as soon as the sandinistas agree calero 
said some of the aid approved by congress already was on its way 
to refugee camps on the hondurannicaraguan border he added 
the plight of the troops has been a contributing cause to a 
reported rift among the contra leaders but calero minimized the 
differences among the five directors of the nicaraguan resistance 
insisting they were united

antiugly law an ordinance aimed at eliminating suburban 
eyesores and will allow residents to air their dirty laundry in 
public provided its not in the front yard 
the council on monday scrapped some provisions of the new law 
and changed others bowing to citizen complaints about the 
ordinance 
among other things it altered the law to make it enforceable 
upon citizen complaint and not merely at the whim of someone in 
city hall 
laundry still cant be aired in the front yard but is 
permissible in side yards and on porches and balconies 
the council in this san francisco bay area community also 
eliminated its ban on garbage cans in side yards 
the revised law contains most of its original provisions 
intended to rid neighborhoods of discarded furniture automobile 
bodies and other unsightly junk it bans graffiti dirt piles 
overgrown vegetation or other debris on residential and 
nonresidential property if such messes can be seen from the 
street 
violators face fines up to 500 and those convicted of breaking 
the law more than three times within a year could face both a fine 
and a jail sentence

the government today celebrated the 
10th anniversary of its socialist revolution with a sovietstyle 
parade of workers soldiers and military hardware 
president najib led dozens of afghan officials and a 
littleknown soviet delegation atop a reviewing stand for the 
morning procession 
the parade followed a night of unusually heavy rifle fire and a 
rebel rocket blast in the eastern hills 
on monday najib proposed a withdrawal of government soldiers 
from the posts near the pakistani border to create a nonmilitary 
line between afghanistan and pakistan najib said afghan troops 
would leave its positions if antigovernment guerrillas and 
pakistani troops do the same 
the proposal appeared to be little more than a facesaving 
admission of the difficulties the afghan army is having against 
onslaughts by anticommunist insurgents based in pakistan and 
supplied with us and chinese weapons 
at the parade afghan government troops bearing sovietsupplied 
rifles marched past the leadership and about 500 dignitaries under 
striped awnings erected to protect them from the strong sun 
reflecting the kremlins recent attempts to cut a lower profile 
in afghan government affairs the senior soviet in attendance was 
vladimir orlov of the russian republics parliamentary body and 
even soviet journalists could not identify the two or three other 
kremlin envoys who stood with najib on the reviewing stand 
six bodyguards with uzi machine guns stood watch around najib 
defense minister mohammed rafi premier sultan ali keshmandt and 
other afghan officials no disturbances took place during the 
twohour parade 
an afghan official confirmed today that a rocket fired by 
insurgents opposed to the sovietbacked government had landed in 
the city but said he did not know details of damage or whether the 
blast had caused casualties 
it was especially noisy last night perhaps because they the 
guerrillas wanted to say something about the holiday said the 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the celebration was reminiscent of moscows may day and 
revolution day parades in which hundreds of thousands of soviets 
trek past the leadership assembled at red square 
it was in april 1978 that marxists inspired and armed by soviet 
advisers staged a coup and killed president mohammed daoud the 
revolution sparked a widespread insurgency plunging the nation 
into a civil war and driving an estimated 5 million afghans into 
neighboring pakistan and iran 
soviet troops and tanks moved in to assist the embattled kabul 
leadership in december 1979 replacing one prosoviet government 
with another

jessica hahn says she would consider 
appearing on the ptl ministrys television show to help raise 
money and says she wants the financially troubled ministry to 
survive 
people probably think im so antiptl im completely 
opposite miss hahn said monday i dont want this dream to 
die its not ptl founder jim bakkers dream god gave him the 
dream id hate to see it die because one man felt he was 
bigger than god 
i would encourage people they better get a grip on whats 
really happening before its too late and its turned into a 
shopping center 
miss hahn is the former church secretary whose sexual encounter 
with bakker led to his downfall she said ptl must survive even 
if it means bringing back bakker and his wife 
i almost wish jim and tammy would go back miss hahn told 
the charlotte observer from the playboy mansion in los angeles 
where she now lives id hate to see that place lost ive 
always said from day one that god did call this man 
im a little nervous saying this but if jim came back i 
believe he wouldnt mess up people would be behind him watching 
him 
ptl which has lost its tax exempt status sued miss hahn last 
week for an estimated 160000 remaining in a trust account that 
had been promised her for not disclosing the 1980 tryst with bakker 
told of miss hahns offer to appear on the show ptl spokesman 
david west chose his words carefully 
we would certainly welcome any sincere and genuine effort to 
help west said but at the present we think that having 
jessica appear on the program might not be as helpful as she would 
want it to be 
bakker has said hed like to come back to rescue the ministry 
but ptls new leadership opposes bakkers return

soviet forces are beginning to 
withdraw from eastern afghanistan where anticommunist guerrillas 
have taken several posts since the geneva accord was signed 
western diplomatic sources said today 
the sources speaking in islamabad on condition of anonymity 
said the red army also has begun transporting wrecked vehicles back 
to the soviet union apparently to prevent them from being salvaged 
by the insurgents 
under the geneva agreement signed april 14 the estimated 
115000 soviet troops are to start leaving afghanistan on may 15 
diplomats quoting reports from their kabul missions said 
evidence of the impending pullout is seen in heavy soviet air 
traffic in and out of kabul airport and the movement of massive 
soviet convoys near the capital 
one source quoted an unidentified soviet diplomat in kabul as 
saying soviet troops are being consolidated in nangarhar 
paktia and paktika provinces all of which border pakistan 
afghanistans communist president najib also offered on monday 
to withdraw his own troops from posts near the pakistan border he 
told three small parties loyal to his government that creation of 
a nonmilitary line was contingent on agreement with pakistan 
and the guerrillas 
pakistan where the insurgents are based is a conduit for us 
military aid to the guerrillas it also houses 3 million refugees 
of the civil war 
soviet troops intervened in afghanistan in late 1979 when they 
replaced one marxist government with another 
diplomatic sources said the soviets are resupplying the afghan 
army as they prepare to hand the war over to them 
however government troops are reported to have fled several 
posts in eastern afghanistan in the past 10 days including a 
strategic garrison at barikot on the pakistan border in 
northeastern kunar province 
the insurgents also reportedly have overrun six soviet and 
afghan posts in logar province just south of kabul and kandahar 
in the southeast 
western diplomats disagree on the kabul governments ability to 
survive once the soviets leave 
some diplomats say the insurgents recent successes in the east 
signalled the beginning of the end of the kabul government others 
predict that heavy fortifications in the capital might keep it 
secure after the soviet pullout

a high court judge ruled that the bones of a 10th 
century english king can be transferred to a russian exiles church 
near london 
deputy judge robert wright decided monday that the fragmented 
1000yearold bones of the young saxon monarch edward the martyr 
can be moved to the russian orthodox church community at brookwood 
the bones are now in a box in a bank vault and the judge said 
they can be transferred when the church converted from an anglican 
cemetery chapel has been officially approved as a secure place 
its an answer to prayer said the very rev archimandrite 
alexis head of the orthodox community at brookwood the community 
has been looking for saintly relics for its church which it 
renamed st edward the martyr 
edward king of wessex ruled for three years and was only 16 or 
17 when he was stabbed to death in dorset southwest england in 
978 edward was canonized and his bones at shaftesbury abbey in 
dorset attracted pilgrims in the middle ages 
the buried bones were found in 1930 but john and geoffrey 
claridge two brothers who had inherited the site couldnt agree 
on what to do with them 
john claridge kept the bones and eventually presented them to 
the russian community while his geoffrey claridge sought to have 
them returned to the abbey site 
i wanted them to be properly enshrined and only the russian 
orthodox church was prepared to do that john claridge said 
in the decision wright awarded unspecified legal costs to john 
claridge and the brookwood russian community 
alexis head of st edwards brotherhood of brookwood said the 
reason for his churchs interest in the bones dates to the 1054 
split of christendom into eastern and western churches the russian 
church claims edward the martyr as one of its own because the king 
died before the split and worshiped according to its original 
doctrines

as he rode in his limousine to the airport arafat shouted to

were useful and will have positive results on the palestinian and 
arab levels

man in fatah the plos main guerrilla faction and arafats main 
power base 
an aide said arafat will be back within a month 
also today egypt welcomed the arafatassad meeting saying it 
supports palestiniansyrian coordination to advance the rights of

resumed relations with cairo last year after breaking diplomatic 
ties following egypts 1979 peace treaty with israel

was attended by khalaf kaddoumi and five other senior aides all

for two rubles soviet personal computer users 
soon will be able to access information probably beyond the 
capabilities of their present systems 
in the first joint publishing venture between the united states 
and soviet union officials signed an agreement monday to publish a 
russianlanguage edition of a major personal computing magazine 
no magazines of any kind in the ussr are based on the concept 
of a joint venture with another firm for personal computers or 
anything else eugene n salnicov director of radio i sviaz 
publishers said of the business agreement with international data 
group communications inc 
about 50000 copies of pc world ussr will hit soviet bookstores 
and newsstands in late june priced at two rubles or 320 at the 
official exchange rate said idg president alex leblois the 
magazine will contain about onethird original copy written by a 
staff of seven soviet editors and writers 
personal computing is in its infancy in the soviet union which 
officials said has had trouble manufacturing computers there are 
fewer than 100000 personal computers in the country but soviet 
and american officials tout a potential market of 30 million 
the liberalization of foreign investment laws soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs policy of glasnost and the recent easing of 
western technology export laws are critical to the publication of 
the new magazine 
leblois said that us hightech export regulations were eased 
in january to allow 16bit personal computers to be sold to the 
soviet union he predicted that american western european and 
japanese computer makers will rush to secure joint production 
agreements 
in keeping with soviet guidelines on joint ventures adopted in 
january 1987 the soviet partner will own 51 percent of the project 
to idgs 49 percent 
salnicov and michael volodarsky chief advisor to the chairman 
of goskomizdat the soviet state committee on publishing printing 
and book trade signed the agreement at idg headquarters in 
framingham mass 
leblois said idg has invested 250000 in the project but 
expects to recoup that almost immediately through advertising from 
western computer makers seeking a foothold in the soviet union 
marshall goldman associate director of the russian research 
center at harvard university said the principle problem with about 
30 joint ventures between the soviets and foreign companies to date 
has been the repatriation of hard currency 
but idg said pc world ussrs sales will cover all production 
costs and that its revenues will come from advertising paid for in 
western currencies foreign firms typically have had problems 
getting ruble earnings out of the soviet union 
salnicov said some foreign language computer journals are 
available in moscow libraries but that soviet pc users have no 
information about developments within the country 
idg publishes pc world the second largest us publication on 
personal computers with a monthly circulation of about 475000

panamas embattled ambassador to israel 
blames his troubles with his own government on an israeli adviser 
to panamanian military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega 
ambassador eduardo herrera told a news conference monday his 
dismissal from panamas army after 22 years service followed an 
argument with the israeli mike harare a security adviser to 
noriega 
herrera who denied reports he also had been dismissed as 
ambassador said his disagreements with harare arose after he 
accused the israeli of using his position to charge large 
commissions to israelis trying to do business in panama 
he blocked commercial ties and potential investments 
herrera told reporters at his home outside tel aviv he demanded 
commissions before anyone could even set foot in panama 
harare is reportedly in israel but efforts to locate him for 
comment were unsuccessful 
a threepage unsigned flyer issued in panama last year accused 
harare of making huge profits from business deals including arms 
sales morton rosenthal of the bnai brith antidefamation league 
in new york said in a telephone interview 
the league issued a report linking antisemitic threats in 
panama to the allegations against harare rosenthal said 
herrera said that in january he went to panama and told the 
government everything i knew about harare i tore the mask off his 
face 
he said the two quarreled in april after the ambassador sold an 
embassy car driven by harare the ambassador said he sold the car 
to save money 
harare sent the ambassador a threatening letter warning him not 
to sell the car herrera wrote back saying he was not afraid 
the letter arrived on april 18 that evening the panamanian 
radio reported that i was dismissed from the army herrera said 
no reason was given for herreras dismissal in reports from 
panama but sources told reporters there that herrera had twice 
refused instructions to return home 
herrara said monday an order for him to return home had been 
rescinded he also denied reports from panama that he was fired as 
ambassador 
an israeli foreign ministry official in jerusalem said the 
israeli government has not received any notification from panama 
that herrera has been dismissed 
noriega is the head of panamas defense force and holds the 
power in panama opposition groups in panama want him to step down 
the united states is supporting the opposition campaign and has 
imposed economic sanctions on panama in an attempt to force noriega 
to leave his post

eighteen people have been arrested for stealing 
and marketing long distance access codes that rang up an estimated 
45 million in fraudulent telephone calls officials said 
the arrests came after a federal grand jury in honolulu returned 
indictments alleging theft of telephone access codes that may have 
been obtained through sophisticated computer technology federal 
officials said 
us attorney gene anderson and skip jones head of the secret 
service office here said in a news release monday the 18 people 
were charged with conspiracy to steal and market long distance 
codes in a nationwide network 
the indictments said the defendants acquired long distance 
telephone credit card numbers and access codes and then marketed 
those codes to defraud long distance telephone companies the 
officials said 
anderson and jones said they said they seized numerous 
unauthorized access codes and a variety of computer and 
telecommunications equipment used in the conspiracy access codes 
are numbers dialed before a telephone number that allow a caller to 
use a particular companys longdistance network 
anderson and jones said the indictments and arrests culminated 
an eightmonth undercover operation by the us secret service 
office in honolulu into the wholesale marketing of unauthorized 
access codes 
agents made more than 600 undercover telephone contacts with 
people involved in marketing the codes officials said the 
undercover agents received more than 600 unauthorized telephone 
access codes from the individuals charged 
anderson and jones said the industry has indicated that more 
than 45 million in fraudulent calls can be attributed to those 
600 codes 
according to industry estimates several of those indicted are 
principal operators of marketing networks responsible for 125 
million in telephone access fraud over the past year they said 
this represents half of the estimated loss of this type from such 
marketing schemes throughout the nation they said 
the government said the communications fraud control 
association a long distance telephone clearinghouse estimates 
losses from all types of access device fraud at about 500 million 
annually for the 40 billion per year long distance telephone

john demjanjuks family intends to continue its 
fight to vindicate the retired cleveland autoworker who was 
sentenced to hang after an israeli court determined he was the nazi 
deathcamp guard ivan the terrible 
an israeli panel of judges monday sentenced demjanjuk 68 to 
death the three judges ruled a week ago that the former ohio 
autoworker was responsible for the deaths of thousands of jews at 
the treblinka concentration camp in poland during world war ii 
ed nishnic demjanjuks soninlaw said demjanjuk has been 
railroaded through the israeli court system 
nishnic said the family still believes that demjanjuk is 
innocent and would fight all the way to the end 
i spoke to mr demjanjuk yesterday he believes half the world 
already knows he is not ivan the terrible and the rest of the 
world will learn it soon nishnic said 
demjanjuk claimed a case of mistaken identity but some 
concentration camp survivors identified demjanjuk as the prison 
guard who would beat jews on the way to the gas chamber the judges 
ruled that his alibi that he was a prisoner of war who never was 
in treblinka did not stand up to scrutiny 
in cleveland lawyer john j horrigan who as an assistant us 
attorney represented the government in demjanjuks 1981 
denaturalization trial said the death sentence came as no surprise 
in the end they like every other court or tribunal who 
looked at the case were left with little alternative but to find 
him guilty and impose the only sentence consistent with that 
finding horrigan said his alibi was a joke 
but members of clevelands ukrainian community still believed 
demjanjuk 
it has been the unanimous opinion of this parish that 
demjanjuk is innocent that has been the opinion since the 
beginning said the rev john nakonachny a priest at st 
vladimirs ukrainian orthodox church the demjanjuk familys parish 
after the verdict vandals painted purple circles on st 
vladimirs and jewish organizations in akron about 40 miles south 
of cleveland asked for additional police protection because 
callers were threatening local jews 
police said a priest at st vladimirs told them the purple 
paint might signify blood on the church 
in buffalo ny demjanjuks former attorney said he does not 
think demjanjuk will be executed 
the israeli people are the real jury said mark oconnor 
who represented demjanjuk for five years during deportation 
proceedings and during the beginning of trial while they have 
doubts i dont see how the court can go through with it 
oconnor said he was fired last year because demjanjuks family 
thought he was being projewish by refraining from attacking 
witnesses and using the talmud to make his points 
martin plax clevelandarea director for the american jewish 
committee said the sentencing represented a sense of relief and 
closure that the sort of behavior exhibited by ivan the terrible 
has been adjudicated 
mary dackiewicz operating the john demjanjuk defense fund said 
donations to the fund had slackened recently but calls picked up 
again monday 
the phone calls are from people who have been totally outraged 
at what happened over there she said theyre people from all 
different backgrounds wanting to donate money and asking what they 
can do to help

a fire at a nato storage depot gave 
off a huge cloud of smoke that dusted nearby communities with 
dangerous asbestos authorities said 
officials used bullhorns to warn people living just west of 
mondays fire to stay inside and avoid stirring up the asbestos

to clean up the worst contaminated areas

treaty organization depot employing several thousand people it is 
one of the western defense alliances biggest storage areas for 
technical equipment and spare parts for military vehicles

former president jimmy carter said today that 
a democratic presidential ticket with jesse jackson would be 
amazingly attractive and enable the party to carry the south 
six months ago to be blunt about it i would have said 
no carter said on abctvs good morning america but 
jackson has fooled everyone 
the former president said jacksons attractiveness and the 
quality of his campaign has been amazing and its much easier 
to say very honestly that jackson would be amazingly attractive on 
the ticket compared to what everybody thought he would do before 
this campaign started 
carter said he thought a ticket with jackson on it would win in 
the south and carry his home state of georgia 
as you know jackson came in first in georgia as it was he 
said 
carter did not specify whether he envisioned jackson in the 
presidential or vice presidential slot 
carter who will attend the democratic national convention as a 
super delegate has refused to endorse any of the partys 
candidates but said if someone had to bet one way or another 
michael dukakis would be the most likely nominee 
asked if jackson should be the partys vice presidential choice 
carter said it would be improper for him to presume that dukakis 
not jackson would win the nomination 
he added that if dukakis wins the nomination jackson has 
exhibited in the last year or so a remarkable element of 
substantiality and common sense and loyalty to the party and 
attractiveness to a wide range of people and i guess then in the 
convention that whatever happens jacksons support will be 
constructive whether hes on the ticket or not

an antinuclear groups choices for the 
nations worst nuclear power plants are largely identical to a list 
compiled by government regulators in 1986 
the group public citizen on monday named 16 plants as the 
nations worst thirteen of those plants were also on the nuclear 
regulatory commissions list 
of the 16 public citizen named two as worst than the rest 
those plants were pilgrim near plymouth mass operated by 
boston edison co and rancho seco at sacramento calif operated 
by the sacramento municipal utility district 
both were closed throughout 1987 at the insistence of the 
nuclear regulatory commission to correct operational and management 
problems local authorities are discussing the sale of rancho seco 
now operating at 30 percent of full power under recent restart 
approval granted by the commission and sacramento voters will 
decide next month whether to keep it open 
the similarity between public citizens list and the nrcs 
list strongly suggests that these plants are indeed the worst in 
the united states public citizens critical mass project 
said in its monday report entitled nuclear lemons 
public citizen is an advocacy organization founded by consumer 
activist ralph nader 
responding the committee for energy awareness a pronuclear 
trade group said industry performance is improving as shown by 
reductions in unplanned automatic shutdowns of reactors radiation 
exposure and losttime accidents 
spokesman don winston said the committee had not had a chance to 
study the pulic citizen report in detail 
public citizen ranked the nations 105 operating civilian 
nuclear power reactors according to 10 criteria such as downtime 
operation and maintenance expense and exposure of the workforce to 
radiation 
a reactor was awarded 15 points if it was the worst in a 
category 14 if the second worst and so forth rankings were made 
by the number of 15 worst lists the reactor appeared on with 
points used as a tiebreaker 
the 16 plants named by public citizen are 
rancho seco sacramento calif pilgrim plymouth mass peach 
bottom no 3 delta pa peach bottom no 2 delta pa fermi no 
2 monroe mich oyster creek forked river nj sequoyah no 1

the ranch seco pilgrim sequoyah and browns ferry plants were 
all closed throughout 1987 
a similar list compiled by the nuclear regulatory commission in 
1986 originally included oyster creek and the two cook plant 
reactors at benton harbor mich these three were deleted and 
replaced by the two peach bottom reactors the commission also 
included the lasalle no 2 plant and the turkey point no 3 and no 
4 plants near miami and did not include the dresden no 2 and 
byron no 1 plants that appeared on public citizens list

riot police today fired tear gas to 
break up demonstrations against alleged vote fraud as south koreans 
cast ballots for a new parliament in an election the governing 
party was expected to win 
the opposition which failed to unify before the election 
charged the government was manipulating votecounting computers 
after a staterun television station reported monday that a 
governing party candidate had won with 39 percent of the vote 
the mbc network said a local affiliate on cheju island 
accidentally broadcast an election rehearsal the network said it 
fired the station manager and four other officials 
seoul prosecutors today said their counterparts on cheju island 
were investigating whether election laws were violated by the 
broadcast 
the statecontrolled kbs television network meanwhile reported 
after the polls closed that five governing party members and three 
opposition candidates were leading their races 
in seoul police fired tear gas to disperse 300 yonsei 
university students who threw rocks and firebombs to protest 
alleged election manipulation in favor of the governing democratic 
justice party of president roh taewoo 
earlier police broke up a similar protest by 50 yonsei 
students no injuries were reported in either demonstration 
in the afternoon hundreds of students dashed through alleys and 
sidestreets in seouls downtown myongdong shopping area shouting 
slogans against election rigging and chanting down with 
dictatorship 
police pursued them sometimes hurling tear gas grenades at one 
point citizens rescued a student being dragged away by riot police 
yonhap the korean news agency said police arrested more 120 
students in kwangju and nearby areas in southwestern south korea 
in the southern city of chonju about 500 dissidents and 
opposition supporters battled riot police in the streets for nearly 
two hours 
voting began at 7 am at 13812 pollings stations nationwide to 
choose a 299member national assembly 
the polls closed at 6 pm 5 am edt most returns were 
expected by early wednesday 
officials estimated 726 percent of the 262 million registered 
voters turned out down from 846 percent in the 1985 legislative 
elections and 892 percent in the december presidential election 
opposition leader kim youngsam of the reunification democratic 
party who ran for an assembly seat in the southern city of pusan 
accused the government of staging unfair unjust elections 
unprecedented in our history 
on monday the governing party expelled one candidate after 
4296 envelopes each containing the equivalent of about 30 and 
campaign leaflets for democratic justice candidate kwon joongdong 
were intercepted by opposition members at a post office in andong 
south of seoul police reported 90 cases of electionrelated 
violence nationwide in the campaign with more than 150 people 
detained and 77 of them formally charged 
a 90second broadcast on monday on southern cheju island by an 
affiliate of the statecontrolled mbc national television network 
said a governing party candidate had won in a local district and it 
gave vote totals 
the network later apologized for what it called a technical 
error by engineers during a rehearsal for scheduled live broadcast 
of the ballot count 
but protesters said the use of definite numbers in the broadcast 
was proof the government planned to manipulate the computer vote 
count 
about 400 students in cheju marched in the streets early today 
protesting an unforgivable government attempt at computer 
manipulation 
students in kwangju chonju pusan and cheju also held rallies 
to denounce the broadcast and vowed to launch more antigovernment 
protests 
later however an official at the central election management 
committee said the voting is proceeding relatively smoothly 
rohs rising popularity and a split within the opposition were 
expected to help the democratic justice party win a majority in the 
national assembly 
public support for the opposition eroded after its leaders kim 
daejung of the party for peace and democracy and kim youngsam 
both insisted on running in the december presidential election 
splitting the opposition vote roh won the first direct 
presidential election in 16 years with 36 percent of the vote 
the opposition gained momentum in widespread antigovernment 
protests last june roh then chairman of the democratic justice 
party agreed to many of the democratic reforms demanded by the 
opposition and the political climate has become freer 
the governing party campaigning on pledges of stability for 
economic and democratic progress hoped to win about 125 of the 224 
seats being decided in singlemember districts along with 38 of 
the 75 seats to be decided by the parties nationwide vote 
proportions 
a new constitution that took effect in february gives the 
national assembly greater power in such matters as inspecting state 
affairs and the president no longer can dissolve it

attorneys for indicted teamsters union president jackie presser 
dont have a right to secret documents the federal government is 
protecting 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals 
ruled unanimously monday that a lower court was incorrect in

friedman and anthony hughes fellow officers of clevelands 
teamsters local 507

cleveland who had ruled in favor of defense attorneys 
in essence the district court concluded that the defense 
has a constitutional right to know the tactical strengths and 
weaknesses of the governments case against it the supreme court 
has never held that the constitution creates such a right and we do 
not believe that it exists judge danny boggs wrote in the 6th 
circuits decision 
defense attorney john climaco said monday he was unaware of the 
appellate ruling he declined to comment until he had a chance to 
see the opinion 
white is scheduled to preside over the july 12 trial the three 
defendants are charged in a may 1986 federal indictment with having 
perpetrated a 700000 payrollpadding scheme in which ghost 
employees were put on the union payroll of local 507 
presser 60 is secretarytreasurer of local 507 as well as 
president of the 16 millionmember teamsters union

serving as government informants at the time and that the fbi had

an evacuation rehearsal of the town 
surrounding the nations only methyl isocyanate plant was not 
realistic because it was too well planned critics claim 
sirens sounded twice about seven minutes apart at institute to 
signal the evacuation the first coming at 919 am 19 minutes 
late one hour later only about 30 people had arrived at an 
emergency shelter in nearby south charleston 
the participation of citizens is not all that important 
said kanawha county commission president doug stump who called 
mondays exercise successful 
most residents and workers at businesses and west virginia state 
college either skipped work or ignored the drill construction 
workers at the colleges new science building across the street 
from one siren continued working 
the town is the site of a rhonepoulenc chemical plant that 
formerly was owned by union carbide corp the plant produces methyl 
isocyanate the chemical that leaked from a union carbide plant in 
bhopal india in 1984 killing more than 2000 people 
less than a year after the bhopal disaster the leak of another 
chemical at the institute plant injured at least 135 people 
prompting the call by some community leaders for an organized 
evacuation plan for the town of 1500 
local officials built a onelane emergency road to help 
residents flee but the gate to that road is kept locked except 
when needed monday was the first time it was used 
stump said the drill was designed primarily as a training 
exercise for police firefighters and other emergency workers 
its like basic training in the army you know the procedures but 
every real incident will be different he said 
mondays evacuation was conducted under special circumstances 
west virginia state college next door to the plant called off 
classes in the morning so there were few students to evacuate the 
town also was evacuated in stages so the roads leading out of town 
wouldnt be too crowded 
when this was prepared people didnt take it seriously 
said lois thurston a custodian at west virginia state im sure 
if the students were here they wouldnt know what was going on 
i can envision cars all over the track its just a little 
trail it would be mayhem said barbara clark a health and 
physical education instructor at west virginia state it will be 
a mess 
carla tyree a rhonepoulenc employee and institute resident 
was among dozens of volunteers who manned the streets to direct 
traffic carried out emergency procedures or took notes on mondays 
drill 
all in all i think the communitys glad this kind of response 
is going on said tyree im sure a lot of persons have learned 
what to do in an emergency as far as coordinating learning who 
does what 
rosie mcknight who lives about a mile from the plant said she 
didnt hear the siren and didnt realize the drill was under way 
until her husband came by their house 
i wanted to participate so they can get an accurate play out 
on what would happen mcknight said if theyre going to spend 
all that money trying to get this operation the least we can do is 
participate

the american medical associations move to seek 
federal regulation of socalled smokeless cigarettes is 
premature and unecessary a tobacco company spokesman says 
the ama said monday it has petitioned the food and drug 
administration to regulate the nicotine products introduced last 
fall by rj reynolds tobacco co and to review their ingredients 
and safety before they go on the market 
dr lonnie bristow an ama board member said nicotine is an 
addictive harmful drug that constricts blood vessels because the 
reynolds cigarette contains nicotine he said it should be 
regulated 
it promotes and maintains the nicotine addiction he said in 
an interview 
for those individuals who have vascular disease it is 
particularly dangerous because they may be lulled into thinking 
they are using a safe product he said 
but david fishel a spokesman for the company in winstonsalem 
nc said court decisions have affirmed that cigarettes do not 
come under fda regulations and the new product should be in the 
same category 
fishel said the new cigarette which generates a smaller amount 
of smoke than regular cigarettes is being tested and results will 
be available to the scientific community before it is test marketed 
we think its a very uninformed premature attempt to bring 
about regulation of a product which they know very little about at 
this point fishel said of the ama petition 
at a news conference unveiling the cigarette last september 
reynolds tobacco chairman and chief executive edward horrigan jr 
said the company was not claiming the new product was a safe or 
safer cigarette 
he said however that it eliminated or greatly reduced most of 
the compounds produced by burning tobacco including most 
compounds that are often associated with the smokingandhealth 
controversy 
but bristow of san pablo calif said any impression that the 
smokeless cigarette is better for health is dangerous 
its sort of like saying we wont have people dying from lung 
cancer well have them dying from vascular disease because of 
nicotines effects bristow said vascular disease affects the 
arteries and veins causing blood circulation problems 
the reynolds cigarette introduced in september contains tobacco 
that is heated but not burned nicotine is delivered to the user 
through a tiny metal capsule which when heated produces an 
aerosol resembling tobacco smoke 
a piece of charcoal in the smokeless cigarettes end is lit 
and generates the heat bristow said 
rj reynolds a subsidiary of rjr nabisco inc of atlanta 
initially indicated it hoped to markettest the product this year 
the ama petition states that other products with nicotine such 
as gum and a nontobacco cigarette that produces a nicotine vapor 
have come under official fda scrutiny 
under federal law the fda has six months to respond to the ama 
petition in a related issue three other health groups asked the 
government monday to begin regulating lowtar cigarettes on grounds 
that advertising claims for the products make them a drug subject 
to federal oversight 
the american cancer society american heart association and 
american lung association argued that advertisements pushing 
cigarettes with low levels of tar and nicotine in essense make a 
health benefit claim for those products 
fda spokesman bill gribb said the groups petition would be 
reviewed in the next few weeks

israeli troops today ambushed a band of arabs 
at the lebanese border as the guerrillas launched a raid into 
israel the military said three arabs and two israeli soldiers 
were killed 
two other soldiers were wounded the army said one was in 
serious condition with a gunshot wound to the chest hospital 
authorities said 
the israeli army said the clash occurred 200 yards inside israel 
after troops on an early morning patrol encountered guerrillas 
trying to infiltrate from lebanon 
however a lebanese police spokesman said the predawn clash 
occurred in lebanese territory near the southern village of kfar 
shouba when israeli troops opened fire at a sevenman guerrilla 
group 
the army said soldiers chased the guerrillas through rocky 
terrain and scrub brush and fought a brief battle in which the 
guerrillas threw hand grenades and fired a rocket 
the lebanese police spokesman said the fierce clash raged 
for about three hours 
the israelis fired flares at the rate of 20 every five minutes 
as their helicopter gunships chased the guerrillas in the region 
he said 
the guerrillas were apparently ambushed before launching a 
crossborder raid into northern israel the spokesman said he 
spoke on condition of anonymity in keeping with standing 
regulations 
israeli radio said the soldiers fought the guerrillas at a 
distance of two yards but did not give the exact site of the clash 
the lebanese police spokesman said the guerrillas were from two 
prosoviet groups the lebanese communist party and the popular 
front for the liberation of palestine of george habash 
gen yossi peled head of northern command identified the 
guerrillas as palestinians however the lebanese communist party 
is made up of lebanese 
kfar chuba is a small village on the slopes of biblical mt 
hermon about one mile from an area where the borders of lebanon 
israel and syria converge 
the lebanese village is inside israels selfdesignated 
security zone the zone intended to protect israel from 
attacks across the border was created by israel in 1985 after it 
withdrew most of its forces from lebanon israel had invaded 
lebanon in 1982 
peled said the guerrillas had targeted civilians children 
israeli settlements in their raid 
the army did not say whether any guerrillas escaped news of the 
incident was held up eight hours while the border was searched 
it was difficult bushy terrain easy to hide in said a 
military commander at the scene who was interviewed by israeli 
radio but not identified in keeping with army regulations 
we closed off the area and chased them for several hours they 
hid in the bushes and were difficult to see he said they 
fired first at our force and the soldiers fired back 
todays incident was the 11th attempted infiltration and the 
deadliest along the lebanese border since nov 25 when a guerrilla 
landed in northern israel on a hang glider entered a military base 
and killed six israeli soldiers before being shot to death himself 
israeli officials have linked past infiltration attempts to a 
nearly fivemonth long arab uprising in the occupied territories in 
which 173 palestinians and two israelis have died 
the two dead soldiers were the first israeli casualties 
involving lebanon since feb 23 when two soldiers died when their 
tank ran over a mine in south lebanon 
the most recent attempted infiltration was april 13 when 
soldiers shot and killed three arab guerrillas on a hostagetaking 
mission 
in the occupied gaza strip meanwhile un officials and news 
reports said israeli steps to break the palestinian uprising could 
temporarily block tens of thousands of palestinians from reaching 
jobs in israel 
christine dabagh a spokeswoman for the un relief and works 
agency said the army was preventing people from reaching jobs by 
taking their identity cards and returning them only after the arabs 
underwent lengthy checks at three government offices 
israeli television said the program was aimed at breaking a tax 
boycott that has been a tactic of the palestinian uprising 
in new york meanwhile the un security council condemned the 
assassination of the plos military commander the united states 
did not use its veto allowing the resolution to pass 140 
khalil wazir the no 2 man in the palestine liberation 
organization was gunned down april 16 at his home in tunisia 
israeli sources and tunisian officials have said wazir was slain by 
israeli commandos the israeli government has declined comment 
israeli leaders expressed concern about attempts by plo leader 
yasser arafat and syrian president hafez assad to end five years of 
bloody rivalry and revive a hardline alliance against israel 
assad who expelled arafat from syria in 1983 met the plo chief 
on monday in damascus

secretary of state george p shultz back from 
moscow is reporting to president reagan on the slow progress in 
arms control negotiations with the soviet union 
schultz was briefing reagan at midafternoon 
unless there is an unexpected breakthrough or a shift in 
policy a treaty to halve us and soviet strategic nuclear weapons 
is unlikely to be ready for reagan and general secretary mikhail s 
gorbachev to sign when they meet in moscow may 29 through june 2 
the two sides are far apart on methods to verify cutbacks in 
mobile missiles and cruise missiles carried on fighter planes and 
warships 
another obstacle is reagans strategic defense initiative 
the soviets are refusing to sign the treaty unless they have the 
right to suspend reductions if they conclude that us antimissile 
tests in space violate the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty 
shultz was unable to bridge the differences in his talks in 
moscow last week with gorbachev and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze he will see shevardnadze again may 1112

thunderstorms peppered 10 alabama 
counties with hail the size of tennis balls leaving thousands of 
car owners and car dealerships sizing up dents and cracked 
windshields 
it looks horrible frank mcgough said monday as he surveyed 
the lot at capitol chevrolet in montgomery 
weve got close to 2000 vehicles on our lot and i would say 
99 percent of them have some damage mcgough said hail is the 
worst thing that can happen to an automobile dealership because it 
dents all your vehicles up 
mcgough said one employee estimated damages at close to 500000 
meanwhile officials at the alabama emergency management center 
were relieved that even worse damage was avoided as tornadoes swept 
across three counties without touching down 
tornado warnings which mean a tornado has been spotted on 
radar were issued in montgomery macon and lee counties during the 
late afternoon by 730 pm however the warnings had been lifted 
robin hearn a spokesman at the montgomerybased aemc said 
officials received numerous reports of heavy thunderstorms and 
hailstorms but that there were no reports of a tornado touching 
down 
in lee county an ambulance driver called emergency officials to 
report winds gusting so hard that he couldnt control his vehicle 
state troopers reported no fatalities or serious injuries 
related to the storms 
wade hilton a meteorologist with the national weather service 
said the tornado warnings were issued after radar showed several 
funnel clouds moving toward montgomery at about 60 mph 
its like a tornado aloft but not touching the ground 
hilton said 
hilton said hail from an inch and a half to three inches in 
diameter is often produced in such a storm 
hearn said the emergency office had heard several descriptions 
of the size of the hail weve heard anything from tennisball 
sized up to baseballsized 
in eufaula hearn said officials reported pigeon eggsized 
hail 
i think somebody sits around and tries to think up this 
terminology he said

health authorities today ordered the seizure of all 
grapefruits in italy after tests showed that several grapefruits in 
a rome supermarket had been laced with poison 
italian news media said the poisoned grapefruits apparently had 
been imported from israel although officials did not immediately 
say where they were grown 
last week an organization saying it was supporting the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied territories claimed it 
had poisoned israeli grapefruit on sale in milan laboratory checks 
at the time found no trace of poison 
but authorities in the region of lazio which includes the city 
of rome said health officials later inspected grapefruits in one 
rome supermarket after a newspaper received a threatening telephone 
call 
of the 12 grapefruits on sale six were found to have been 
injected with a bluish poison so powerful that it immediately 
killed laboratory mice the italian news agency ansa said 
the caller said he was speaking in the name of the previously 
unheard of organization of metropolitan proletarians and 
oppressed people 
the first seizure order was made today by health authorities in 
lazio it was quickly followed by a national health ministry order 
for the seizure of all grapefruits on sale or in warehouses around 
the country

jurors who convicted former mayor roger 
hedgecock on perjury and conspiracy charges could be put on trial 
themselves under an appeals court ruling on jury tampering 
allegations a dissenting judge said 
deputy attorney general bob foster said monday he will appeal a 
ruling by the 4th district court of appeal which ordered a lower 
court to hold an evidentiary hearing on jury misconduct and jury 
tampering allegations 
compelling former hedgecock jurors to testify in the hearing 
could create a colossal discouragement towards jury duty among 
citizens said steve casey spokesman for the san diego county 
district attorney 
it used to be that jurors were protected from that the law 
wanted to protect them from that kind of intimidation and 
harassment casey said this certainly transcends the hedgecock 
case and were concerned about it 
foster said mondays ruling was a dangerous precedent because 
the evidentiary hearing could expose jurors to subpoenas under new 
trial motions 
until now it seemed fairly clear that you could not bring a 
juror on subpoena into a motion for a new trial in a criminal 
case said foster who litigated the appeal for the district 
attorneys office thats a change in the law and creates a 
conflict of authority amongst published cases 
the dissenting judge in the 21 ruling agreed justice edward 
butler said the decision authorizes a trial of jurors who return 
a guilty verdict in a criminal case 
in the majority opinion justices said the trial judge failed to 
properly consider jury misconduct complaints by hedgecock who 
resigned as a convicted felon on dec 10 1985 two months after 
his conviction 
however the majority opinion added in our view the evidence 
fully supports the jurys conclusion that hedgecock was part of a 
conspiracy to violate the disclosure requirements of the political 
reform act and the local campaign finance laws 
hedgecocks conviction stemmed from a campaign finance 
conspiracy and coverup attempt in which hundreds of thousands of 
dollars in illegal contributions went unreported on statemandated 
disclosure forms 
hedgecocks lawyer charles sevilla alleged in his appeal that 
a bailiff made derogatory remarks within earshot of the sequestered 
jurors telling one person the former mayor was guilty and that 
prosecutors would win the case hands down 
the allegations against the bailiff were cited in affidavits by 
two jurors the remaining 10 jurors and the bailiff denied the 
allegations 
the justices rejected 23 other issues raised in sevillas appeal 
hedgecock who now works as a local radio talk show host was 
convicted in october 1985 on one count of conspiracy and 12 counts 
of perjury in his second trial his first trial ended in a mistrial 
when the jury hung 111 in favor of conviction 
the charges stemmed from a plot to illegally finance his 
successful 1983 mayoral campaign with more than 350000 from the 
nowdefunct j david amp co investment firm 
hedgecock was sentenced to a year in jail and three years 
probation and fined 1000 but has remained free pending his 
appeal he is vacationing in brazil this week

gov rose mofford says she will file 
amended financial disclosure statements listing land loans and 
partnerships to avoid additional doubts and nitpicking 
but former gov evan mecham who faces criminal charges over 
alleged omissions on his statements notes that amending his 
statements didnt help him 
a top aide to attorney general bob corbin said meanwhile that 
his office was looking into mrs moffords original filings and 
that under the circumstances now it could not give mrs mofford 
advice 
lawmakers said they would prefer to leave matters in corbins 
hands but some left open the possibility of another legislative 
investigation similar to the one that led to mechams impeachment 
well just have to wait until the ag says said house 
speaker joe lane who initiated the mecham investigation after 
corbin confirmed that mechams activities were being scrutinized by 
a grand jury i just hope she gets everything fixed up 
mrs moffords office in a written statement said she hoped to 
file the changes by the end of the week but needed more time to 
research them 
the associated press reported last week that mrs mofford had 
not listed land loan and partnership transactions on the public 
officer reporting forms that she was in charge of during her 10 
years as secretary of state 
mrs mofford said that many of the transactions stemmed from 
arrangements made by her former husband and that she had not 
profited from them 
im not trying to hide anything she said at the time 
adding that everything was reported on her incometax forms she 
declined to make the returns public 
mrs mofford married tr mofford in 1957 they were divorced 10 
years later but the governor says they remained good friends until 
tr died in 1983 
on monday the governor reiterated her position 
i still question whether the law requires that these items be 
disclosed but i wish to avoid even the appearance of 
impropriety she said arizona has been through enough without 
additional doubts and nitpicking 
but mecham read mrs moffords statement laughed and said i 
love it when he got to the passage about doubts and nitpicking 
i dont see any place in the reporting law where it says you 
have to make any profit he added saying that the transaction he 
is accused of concealing a 350000 campaign loan did not 
involve any profit to him 
mrs mofford said she would ask corbin to determine whether the 
items should have been included on her disclosure forms so that 
his advice can be available to her and to other public officials 
faced with questions her office said 
corbin was out of town monday but chief assistant attorney 
general steve twist said his agency planned to review records of 
the transactions 
under the circumstances now it would not be appropriate for 
us to give any personal advice to the governor twist said

a government commission said panamas 
banks can immediately resume some operations suspended nearly two 
months ago but customers will not be allowed to withdraw 
muchneeded cash 
the national banking commission said monday that banks can 
resume offering a dozen services that were suspended following the 
imposition of us economic sanctions aimed at ousting strongman 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
in another development an opposition leader said monday that a 
group of panamanian dissidents is planning to undertake a military 
operation against noriega by the beginning of next week 
ambassador juan b sosa who has maintained his loyalty to 
ousted president eric arturo delvalle told reporters the group is 
made up of officers who have supporters in the panamanian defense 
forces 
sosa gave no details but the group apparently is comprised of 
highranking defectors from the defense forces who came to the 
united states shortly after delvalles ouster two months ago 
a coup attempt against noriega last month was put down quickly 
the new york times meanwhile quoted an unidentified official 
in washington as saying the sweeping us economic sanctions were a 
mistake and that they will be relaxed within a week or so 
the times today quoted the official as saying that the treasury 
department charged with enforcing the sanctions was considering a 
long list of exemptions 
in new york panamas newly appointed foreign minister on monday 
said his top priorities are normalizing relations with the united 
states and persuading it to lift the economic sanctions the 
minister jorge e ritter made the comment in an interview at the 
united nations in new york 
the national banking commission said the services banks can now 
resume include handling letters of credit transferring funds 
within the country collecting outstanding loans and currency and 
metals exchanges 
although customers will not be allowed to withdraw cash the 
panel called the resumption of services an important and decisive 
step toward normal banking operations 
the cash crisis has become so severe in panama that many people 
have been forced to resort to bartering to obtain food for their 
families 
panamanian banks were ordered shut march 4 because there was not 
enough cash to cover withdrawals some banks reopened on april 18 
but only to accept deposits the closures followed us sanctions 
that included the freezing of panamanian funds held in american 
accounts and the withholding of panama canal toll fees normally 
paid to the government 
the sanctions helped create a liquidity crisis in panama which 
uses the us dollar as its official currency the reagan 
administration hoped they would help oust noriega head of panamas 
15000member defense forces 
noriega the power behind the civilian government is under 
indictment in the united states on drug trafficking charges he 
denies the charges 
panamas civilian chief executive manuel solis palma said on 
monday that he will talk with domestic opponents of the government 
only if they dropped calls for noriegas resignation 
what we will not do is surrender before the start of battle 
solis palma told reporters opposition leaders rejected an offer of 
negotiations with the government in march saying noriega must 
leave first

incriminating malaek

but democratic frontrunner dukakis was virtually assured of 
capturing a solid majority of the 178 convention delegates at stake 
in the primary and add to his growing lead in the twoman race for 
the nomination 
the turnout is light this morning said allegheny county 
elections director james scanlon but he added i think the 
weather will help a lot its going to be a beautiful day 
in northwestern pennsylvania erie county elections supervisor 
mary ann edler said polling places reported good turnout 
the weather is sunshiny she said its beautiful the 
turnouts been fantastic this morning 
meanwhile jackson got high praise from former president carter 
who appeared on the abc show good morning america and said the 
former civil rights activist would be amazingly attractive on 
the democratic ticket 
the former president said jacksons attractiveness and the 
quality of his campaign has been amazing and its much easier 
to say very honestly that jackson would be amazingly attractive on 
the ticket compared to what everybody thought he would do before 
this campaign started 
bush campaigning today in lima ohio had critical words for 
the former president saying that democrats would return the 
country to the malaise days of carter 
during the carter administration bush said there wasnt a 
malaise there was a lack of leadership i want to build on our 
outstanding record 
all the candidates wound up their pennsylvania campaigning on 
monday and jackson and bush scheduled appearances today in ohio 
the next big state on the primary schedule dukakis was back in the 
governors office in massachusetts 
with 1081 delegates in the latest associated press tally bush 
was only 58 short of the 1139 needed for a majority at the 
republican national convention in august his only active opponent 
former television evangelist pat robertson has 31 
pennsylvania elects 78 republican delegates giving the vice 
president a strong chance to get his majority when the results come 
in tonight 
dukakis has put together a string of primary victories in 
wisconsin connecticut and new york to knock out all opposition but 
jackson and build the impression that his nomination is inevitable 
dukakis was more than halfway toward a delegate majority 
holding 107515 national convention votes jackson has 8361 while 
60275 are uncommitted a tally of 2081 or more is needed to win 
the nomination at the july convention in atlanta 
dukakis with a overwhelming victory in monday nights utah 
caucuses also would win 19 of the 23 delegates from that state if 
late results hold up with 90 percent of the legislative districts 
reporting dukakis had 71 percent of the vote and jackson had 17 
percent a total that would leave him with four delegates 
about 11 percent of the utah democrats voted in the caucuses to 
remain uncommitted 
ohio indiana and the district of columbia hold primaries next 
tuesday 
during campaign appearances on monday dukakis sounded as though 
he felt his strongest opponent was overconfidence 
he urged supporters to ignore the polls that said he held a wide 
lead in the state pollsters dont vote he said 
the massachusetts governor also took pains to explain the 
complicated ballot 
it isnt enough just to vote for me he told a rally in 
erie this is one election where youve got to vote more than 
once and its legal i need your vote as a candidate our delegates 
need your votes we must do both 
while he and jackson staged a longdistance debate over policy 
toward terrorists jobs was the major theme at dukakis appearances 
make no mistake about it he said im a dyedinthewool 
trueblue fullemployment democrat 
jackson also talked about jobs when he spoke to striking workers 
at a british petroleum corp refinery outside philadelphia 
jackson said profits at the company were up 400 percent last 
year and said for profits to be up and wages down is greedy and 
unfair 
he told the strikers i know its tough but hold on i know 
its tough but reaganomics is on the way out 
he also referred to articles saying that dukakis was 
appropriating many of his campaign themes 
well no 1 that ratifies my leadership he said but 
since he got my message dont choose margarine choose butter 
choose the real thing 
bush toured a jobretraining center in pittsburgh and praised 
the combination of initiatives on the local level 
on the question of dealings with terrorists dukakis and jackson 
agreed that it was proper to talk with people who were holding 
americans hostage in an effort to get their freedom 
but dukakis said you never make concessions to terrorists 
ever 
jackson rejected what he called material concessions to 
terrorists but he said he could envision situations where he would 
agree to allow safe passage to hostagetakers and added i choose 
negotiation over blind bloody confrontation

a convoy of usflagged kuwaiti tankers 
the first since last weeks clash between us and iranian naval 
forces headed into the persian gulf today but turned back because 
of uncertainties about mines shipping executives said 
the executives speaking on condition they not be identified 
said a sandstorm over the gulf restricted visibility of helicopters 
and minehunting vessels accompanying the two tankers and their 
us navy escorts 
a source close to the kuwait oil tanker co said however that 
the convoy might get under way again within 24 hours 
us officials conceded earlier that the convoys were falling 
behind schedule because of concern about mines laid by iran in the 
central gulf and the threat of iranian missile attacks in the 
strait of hormuz the narrow entrance to the waterway 
the us guided missile frigate samuel b roberts was damaged by 
a mine on april 14 and about a dozen mines were later found in 
international waters used by commercial shipping 
american military sources said six of the 11 kuwaiti tankers 
reflagged by the united states last year have been waiting in the 
anchorage in the gulf of oman departure point for the usescorted 
convoys for the past week 
two had been ready to move since april 15 and the other four 
arrived over the next few days creating what one officer called an 
unprecedented traffic jam off the port of khor fakkan 
a seventh tanker the 46723ton liquefied gas carrier gas king 
arrived at kuwait on april 10 it has been stranded there loaded 
but unable to sail down the gulf because of what the source close 
to kuwait oil tanker co called us reticence to risk the mine 
hazard the kuwait oil tanker co owns the reflagged ships 
the company source said the decision to send the tankers to 
kuwait reflected a belief by us and kuwaiti officials that the 
minefield was clear and the missile threat was not serious enough 
to warrant further delays 
british and french convoys have gone through the mine danger 
area without trouble he said 
the mine strike against the roberts caused the united states to 
retaliate against iran 
on april 18 the us navy sank or damaged six iranian gunboats 
and three navy warships came under iranian missile attack in the 
strait of hormuz but were not hit 
a spokesman for the us central command said here that he could 
provide no information on the convoy movement 
the united states customarily does not confirm the movement of 
kuwaiti tanker convoys escorted by us warships until they have 
passed specific danger points in the gulf 
todays convoy was sighted on radar by coastal observers in the 
southern gulf they were unable to identify the ships involved 
us officials in washington had denied last week that the 
escort operations had been suspended

transit workers in bydgoszcz were back 
on the job today after shutting down bus and streetcar service for 
11 hours in a rare show of labor unrest by a governmentsanctioned 
union 
the bus and streetcar drivers ended their walkout monday by 
agreeing to hourly pay raises of about 60 percent the chairman of 
the official union said 
people are not satisfied but this is sufficient for them at 
the moment said harald matuszewski 
the sudden walkout in this western poland city forced thousands 
of people to walk to work and school monday 
a spokeswoman for the official transport workers union one of 
the labor groups put together by the government after the activist 
trade union solidarity was banned in the 1981 martial law 
crackdown said the strike even took union leaders by surprise 
it was an initiative of the drivers she said 
buses and streetcars rolled again at about 530 pm on monday 
workers negotiated with a deputy mayor and a deputy provicial 
governor at a streetcar depot in bydgoszcz the spokeswoman said 
the union spokeswoman said hourly pay will increase by 12 cents 
to 33 cents one driver said he now earns the equivalent of 75 to 
90 a month and expects his pay to be about 25 more 
solidarity founder lech walesa had said earlier he would go to 
bydgoszcz in support of the strikers but he remained at home in 
gdansk apparently because of the settlement 
pressure for pay increases has grown because prices of many 
necessities have gone up 42 percent this year under an economic 
reform program instituted by the communist government 
according to official figures wages had risen about 45 percent 
by april 1 
gen wojciech jaruzelski the polish leader told managers of 
state enterprises last month they risked dismissal if they were too 
generous with wage increases 
meanwhile two solidarity leaders at a heavy machinery plant in 
southeast poland were fired because of a protest rally last week 
and workers there are threatening to strike an opposition 
spokesman said today 
wieslaw wojtas chairman of the founding committee of the 
plants solidarity local and wieslaw turasz a committee member 
were dismissed monday from their jobs at the stalowa wola mills 
said ewa kaberna a solidarity activist in the city

general strike but she did not know when it might take place 
opposition spokesman said about 5000 workers took part in the 
rally the start of the afternoon shift at the sprawling plant in 
stalowa wola about 95 miles southeast of warsaw the plant employs

the world court today ruled 
against the united states attempt to shut down the palestine 
liberation organizations mission in new york 
the ruling implicitly condemned the us move to close the plo 
mission to the united nations by supporting the un position that 
the dispute must be submitted to independent arbitration 
the ruling was the courts second decision against the united 
states in two years 
in 1986 the uns judicial arm condemned as a violation of 
international law the reagan administrations support for the 
rebels fighting nicaraguas sandinista government 
the world court officially known as the international court of 
justice has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary 
adherence to its rulings 
the plo office dispute emanates from american antiterrorist 
legislation signed into law by president reagan last december the 
legislation aims at closing the plos 14yearold observer mission 
to the united nations in new york 
the law classifies the plo as a terrorist organization and 
bars it from operating on us territory the plos information 
office in washington dc was closed down prior to the passage of 
the legislation 
the attempt to shut down the plo mission in new york has been 
condemned by all un member nations except the united states and 
israel as well as by the un administration the us state 
department also opposed the law 
briefs on the case have been filed by the united nations and the 
us government as well as by syria and east germany although 
their contents are confidential the east german and syrian briefs 
are widely considered to support the plo position 
because only sovereign states and un bodies are entitled to 
bring cases before the court the plo was unable to plead its case 
before the 15judge panel 
at the request of the un general assembly secretary general 
javier perez de cuellar filed the court case march 9 in the form of 
a request for a legal opinion on whether the dispute is subject to 
arbitration 
the socalled headquarters agreement a 1947 pact between the 
truman administration and the un specifies that disputes are 
subject to arbitration by a threemember panel 
under that treaty diplomats of un member nations and 
organizations with observer status are guaranteed the right to 
operate in new york 
the reagan administration has rejected independent arbitration 
in the case as premature noting the plo case is under review by a 
federal court in the united states 
but in its submissions to the court the reagan administration 
has also said that the antiterrorist law calls for closing the plo 
mission irrespective of any international legal obligations that 
the united states may have under the headquarters agreement 
the plo was accorded permanent observer status at the united 
nations in 1974 and has maintained an office in manhattan since 
then

a bullet lodged in paul rougeaus buttocks since 
a robbery a decade ago is expected to surface again as an issue in 
attempts to keep rougeau from being executed 
the us supreme court on monday refused to consider a death row 
appeal based on prosecutors remarks about the bullet during 
rougeaus 1978 murder trial but lawyer steven thorpe says he will 
raise the issue again in a different form 
rougeau refused to let doctors remove the slug after the robbery 
and shooting death prosecutors told the jury trying him for 
capital murder in the death of deputy constable ac wilkins that 
rougeau probably feared the bullet would be identified as having 
come from the dead officers gun 
thorpe contended in his appeal that state district judge jon n 
hughes violated the defendants fifth amendment right against 
selfincrimination by permitting the remarks 
the supreme court declined to hear those arguments but thorpe 
said he will file a new appeal claiming that the mention of the 
bullet violated rougeaus fourth amendment right against 
unreasonable search and seizure 
a 1985 supreme court ruling held that suspects have a 
constitutional right to refuse to have a bullet surgically removed 
and in general prosecutors may not use against you the fact that 
you invoked your constitutional rights thorpe said 
he noted that prosecutors may not tell jurors that a defendant 
refused to talk to police 
the supreme court has tried to strike a balance between 
protecting suspects against deeply intrusive acts such as forced 
surgery while still allowing police to get the evidence they need 
by such lesser measures as taking fingerprints or samples of hair 
blood or skin all of which are permitted thorpe said 
but state assistant attorney general robert walt said federal 
courts generally will not rehear cases in which appeal is based on 
search and seizure issues that the defense has had a previous 
opportunity to raise 
wilkins was working as a security guard at houstons stock 
exchange club jan 6 1978 when it was held up by three men 
rougeaus brother joseph 30 was killed in a shootout with 
police the third man gillis guillory 27 later pleaded guilty to 
murder and testified against rougeau in return for a 40year 
sentence 
guillory testified he saw rougeau standing over wilkins 
the officer asked paul not to shoot him again guillory 
said but rougeau replied die like you should and pulled the 
trigger again

and robert lavanant gutted the building with bellitti still there

a federal appeals court said today that a 
state penitentiary inmate whose cell toilet was broken for 37 days 
may have grounds for a claim of cruel and unusual punishment 
a threejudge panel of the 4th us circuit court of appeals 
returned inmate melvin c wilsons complaint to us district court 
in norfolk for further review 
judge richard b kellam had ruled in favor of warden michael c 
samberg on the commode claim as well as other issues raised by 
wilson 
wilson alleged in addition to the toilet and other complaints 
that a lockdown at the downtown richmond prison was unlawful that 
he was denied food that he was illegally put in punitive 
confinement and that meals were unsanitary and insufficient 
the appeals panel upheld kellam on all points but the broken 
toilet which wilson said caused sewage to flood his cell wilson 
also said he was denied cleaning materials and that his meals 
during a lockdown were slid under his cell bars through raw sewage 
samberg in an affidavit said he was not aware of any waste in 
wilsons cell and that the delay in fixing the toilet was caused by 
having to wait for ordered parts 
wilsons description of his broken commode if taken as true 
may well state a claim for cruel and unusual punishment the 
appeals panel said in returning the case to the lower court for a 
determination of the facts 
wilson 44 is serving two life sentences plus 46 years for 
murder robbery and other convictions his sentence began in april

about 4000 workers at the lenin steel 
mill near krakow in southern poland refused to work today because 
they want higher wages opposition spokesmen said 
workers at a big heavy machinery plant in southeast poland 
meanwhile threatened a strike today after two solidarity leaders 
were fired for leading a protest rally there last week members of 
the banned trade union federation said 
according to ryszard bocian a solidarity activist in krakow 
the strike at the lenin mill in the krakow suburb of nowa huta 
began this morning in three departments of the plant and spread 
later to a fourth 
a spokesman at the office of government spokesman jerzy urban 
said only 900 workers went on strike 
a spokeswoman at the plant office told the associated press that 
no one authorized to comment was available 
the reported job action came one day after an 11hour strike by 
2800 transit workers in the western polish city of bydgoszcz 
achieved a wage increase for bus and tram drivers the strike was 
reported in polish newspapers and on television 
the nowa huta steel workers seek pay increases of 30 a month

solidarity activist

himself only as an electronics engineer said workshops were idle 
and talks with management representatives continued

can happen anyplace solidarity chairman lech walesa told 
reporters today in an impromptu news conference at the norwegian 
embassy in warsaw he met there privately with visiting foreign

crackdown in poland although its leadership has managed to remain 
active the government later organized an officially sanctioned 
trade union alliance whose unions now claim 7 million members

program of economic reform decisions on pay no longer will be made 
by the central government he said factory managers themselves will 
have to decide how much their enterprises can afford to pay

first three months of 1988 and wages climbed by 45 percent in the 
same period government officials have expressed concern that wages 
are growing too quickly and will spur even more inflation

dr robert gale an american leukemia 
specialist who treated victims of the 1986 chernobyl nuclear plant 
disaster in the soviet union predicted today that 3000 to 30000 
people will die of cancer as a result of that accident 
he also said he expected another major nuclear accident 
somewhere in the world in the next 25 years maybe in the next 10 
years 
gales forecast was a revision of his prediction a year ago that 
there would be as many as 75000 chernobyl cancer deaths 
last year british radiologists said they expected that the 
delayed effect of the radiation would add about 1000 deaths to the 
estimated 30 million cancer deaths that can be expected to occur in 
western europe in the next 50 years 
were predicting at the moment somewhere between 3000 and 
maybe as many as 30000 extra deaths from cancer over the next 50 
years gale said 
he was interviewed from boston on cbs this morning on the 
occasion of the second anniversary of chernobyl and the publication 
of his book final warning the legacy of chernobyl 
half of the chernobyl fatalities will occur outside the soviet 
union mostly in eastern and western europe gale said 
when you have an accident in one of these power plants its 
an international event he said and its always going to 
happen that at least half of the events are going to occur outside 
of the country of the accident were all in this together in a

israel today temporarily withdrew the press 
credentials of two foreign correspondents because they reported 
details of the assassination of a plo leader without submitting the 
reports to military censors the reporters said 
glenn frankel of the washington post and martin fletcher of nbc 
news were required to hand over their credentials today to the 
government press office 
fletcher quoting israeli sources reported that israel was 
responsible for the april 16 killing of khalil wazir better known 
as abu jihad 
frankel later reported details on the operation he also quoted 
israeli sources 
israeli sources have confirmed that israel carried out the 
assassination the government has declined comment 
the correspondents said they were told by press office head 
yoram ettinger that their credentials which journalists need to 
cover government officials were revoked pending an investigation 
israeli law requires journalists to submit reports relating to 
security matters to military censors the government has given a 
broad definition to security matters and has left submitting the 
reports to the correspondents discretion 
prime minister yitzhak shamir expressed anger monday over the 
correspondents reports 
they the journalists should be punished he was quoted as 
saying on israel radio 
its natural that there are conflicts between any government 
keeping what it considers to be secrets and a free press frankel 
told the associated press this is one of those conflicts 
fletcher said that in his view he broke no censorship law 
because we just continued to work the way we always work we 
waited for them to call us and they didnt so we assumed all was 
ok i assumed what i had was a government leak 
the whole area of israeli censorship as it involves foreign 
correspondents is a gray area he said i think this is all a

the blast that crippled the uss bonefish may 
have been caused by a battery explosion and three missing members 
of the submarines crew may have died trying to save the lives of 
their comrades the navys top officer said today 
the bonefish remained tethered to a rescue ship as officials 
waited for toxic gases to clear before starting salvage efforts 
after the sunday explosions and fire that injured 22 crewman 
atlantic fleet headquarters confirmed today that the first 
explosion occurred while the sub was at periscope depth however 
the spokesman refused to comment on speculation that the ship was 
recharging batteries at the time 
in washington adm carlisle ah trost said a battery explosion 
was a likely cause and said the three missing men might have died 
while saving the lives of their comrades 
all three of those individuals were on watch in the ships 
control room and were last seen there said trost who is chief 
of naval operations and a submariner himself 
so it may well be that they simply ensured that everyone got 
clear and they themselves didnt make it 
relatives of the missing sailors meanwhile maintained vigils 
we still have a little ray of hope said joyce lindgren 
mother of petty officer 3rd class marshall t lindgren of pisgah 
forest nc when he enrolled in the navy i gave him to the lord 
and i have to have trust in him now 
the 30yearold submarine one of the navys last 
dieselelectric subs was participating in training exercises 
sunday in the atlantic about 160 miles off the coast of florida 
when it was rocked by a series of explosions 
at least one blast occurred in the battery compartment and fire 
broke out in the forward battery compartment said lt cmdr aaron 
long spokesman for the atlantic fleet headquarters in norfolk 
the crew brought the sub to the surface and its captain cmdr 
mike wilson ordered it abandoned because of the dense smoke and 
toxic fumes 
of the 92 officer and crew board 89 were taken aboard the 
frigate uss carr and aircraft carrier john f kennedy which were 
involved in the exercises the ships were unable to find the three 
crewmen and officials were uncertain whether they were aboard the 
vessel or in the water 
the bonefish was afloat today alongside the submarine rescue 
ship uss petrel salvage workers were to board the sub once experts 
decided it was safe but navy officials were unsure when that would 
be long said 
long refused to say what types of toxic gases might be present 
or what caused the explosions 
the virginianpilot of norfolk reported today that the first 
explosion occurred at periscope depth leading to speculation that 
the ship was recharging its batteries via a generator drawing air 
through a snorkel raised with the periscope 
fleet spokesman lt fred henney confirmed this morning that the 
first explosion did occur at periscope depth less than about 70 
feet below the surface but would not comment further 
trost said battery explosion is the best information that we 
have as to the cause 
the salvage ship uss hoist from the little creek amphibious base 
in norfolk was expected to join the petrel at the scene today 
on monday injured sailors were taken by helicopter from the 
kennedy to the naval hospital in jacksonville fla twenty were 
held for observation and two were in serious but stable condition 
in intensive care suffering from smoke inhalation 
the majority of them are expected to be released today said 
lt cmdr john crowell hospital administrator 
the only two that will definitely have to stay at least 48 hours 
are lt edmund collins 34 of park forest ill and petty officer 
1st class antone silvia of fort lauderdale said crowell 
the injured crewmen will receive xrays and pulmonary function 
tests to see if they have recovered from the effects of smoke 
inhalation he said 
navy spokesman nick young said none of the sailors was expected 
to talk with the media about their experience after being released 
from the hospital 
the rest of the crew was taken monday to the mayport naval 
station in florida then flown back to charleston sc where the 
submarine is based 
lee causey and his wife alice of jacksonville went to mayport 
to meet their 30year son petty officer 1st class avery l causey 
he didnt say much he was just glad to be back causey 
said its good to see him i was on a submarine for 21 years so 
i know what hes going through 
the sailors who refused to answer reporters questions looked 
grim as they walked across the windy tarmac at the charleston air 
force base to meet relatives one had a bandage on his head 
about 30 people many holding balloons greeted the plane one 
woman held up a single yellow rose another held a balloon and wore 
a jacket reading diesel boats forever beneath a cartoon of a 
submarine 
the 219foot bonefish commissioned in 1958 is powered on the 
surface by diesel engines but when submerged it uses electric 
motors powered by two battery compartments the batteries are 
recharged by a generator when the ship is surfaced 
each battery is equipped with an exhaust system to remove 
battery gases and hydrogen created during recharging 
the virginianpilot quoted retired adm harry d train ii who 
commanded the bonefishs sister ship the barbel in the early 1960s 
as saying that hydrogen builds up during recharging and can be 
hazardous if not vented 
the bonefish is among the last of the navys dieselelectric 
submarines which are used primarily to mimic soviet submarines in 
training exercises the soviets still operate about 100 such subs 
besides lindgren the missing were identified as lt ray everts

the reagan administration told the supreme 
court today that the law establishing independent counsels 
unconstitutionally strips the president of a purely executive 
power and improperly relieves congress of its duty to scrutinize 
federal officials 
the power to prosecute highranking federal officials cannot 
be turned over to a serene process to platonic guardians 
outside the political fray said solicitor general charles fried 
the administrations top courtroom lawyer 
the justices heard 90 minutes of arguments in a crucial battle 
over the federal law that lets independent counsels investigate 
alleged crimes by highranking federal officials their decision is 
expected to be announced by july 
among those defending the law today were michael davidson 
representing senate leaders 
davidson questioned vigorously by several justices said the 
postwatergate law does not tip the balance of power the 
constitution apportioned among the executive legislative and 
judicial branches 
he said the law permits the attorneyunsel must 
stay within the constitutionally required parameters of his 
office 
davidson was responding to a question by justice antonin scalia 
who raised concern congress might trigger a probe of an official 
simply because members of a committee did not like the officials 
response to their questions 
i am concerned about the reality of affecting the balance of 
power between the branches scalia said a congressional 
committee could call for an independent counsel investigation 
anytime testimony by an official is displeasing he said 
fried said a problem of the law is that it excuses congress from 
exercising its proper scrutiny over the president 
he cited the watergate scandal as the prime example of the 
political system working properly public opinion and the threat of 
impeachment rather than an independent prosecutor guaranteed 
that the nixon administration was investigated thoroughly fried 
said 
everyone knows those watergate prosecutors proceeded to a 
denouement without missing a beat he said 
justice anthony m kennedy who joined the court in february 
has disqualified himself from taking part in the case without 
explanation his absence creates the possibility of a 44 tie 
a deadlock would have the effect of upholding a ruling by the 
us circuit court of appeals here that struck down the special 
prosecutor law 
the appeals court ruled that the watergateera law creating 
independent counsels impermissibly gives presidential appointment 
powers to the federal courts 
the 21 appeals court ruling also said the independent counsel 
provisions of the ethics in government act of 1978 were an 
unconstitutional encroachment of the exclusive power of the 
president to enforce criminal laws 
under the law a special court appoints independent counsels or 
special prosecutors at the request of the attorney general to 
investigate alleged criminal wrongdoing 
the law was challenged in the investigation of former justice 
department official theodore b olson 
alexia morrison is investigating allegations that olson lied to 
congress in 1983 during a dispute over the environmental protection 
agencys cleanup program for toxic waste 
also at stake could be the january conviction of former 
presidential aide michael k deaver for lying to a grand jury and 
to a house subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities 
the eventual supreme court decision also might affect the 
indictments of former marine lt col oliver north and three others 
accused of crimes in the irancontra affair 
however independent counsel lawrence e walsh is acting in the 
irancontra case with separate backup power from attorney general 
edwin meese iii and that authority has been upheld by the courts 
nonetheless north and his codefendants say walshs probe still 
is subject to constitutional challenge because his investigation 
began before the backup authority was conferred

jesse jackson has won a court victory 
in new jersey that will allow primary voters to pull one lever to 
choose both a presidential candidate and the delegates assigned to 
him 
hudson county superior court judge burrell ives humphreys 
decided monday on a compromise to address a request by jacksons 
democratic presidential campaign which had challenged the 
balloting system that required voters to vote for a candidate and 
again for the candidates delegate slate 
the jackson campaign said it would be easier for voters to pull 
just one lever rather than two to choose a candidate and 
delegates 
but the democratic party the campaign of gov michael dukakis 
of massachusetts and new jerseys county clerks opposed the plan 
saying it was contrary to party rules would limit a voters 
choices and would be expensive 
on monday humphreys decided to permit voters who wish to do so 
to pull one lever to select their candidate and his delegates 
in areas with machines that can accommodate both single and 
multilever voting humphreys said voters would be given a choice 
in areas without such equipment writein ballots would be 
available to those voters wishing to make separate selections for a 
candidate and delegates 
we should not lose sight of the purpose of the ballot which 
is to allow voters to ma gross 
national product was propelled by a strong increase in consumer 
spending and the biggest surge in business investment in more than 
four years 
economists said the balanced growth was good news for 
republicans in an election year and should bury lingering fears 
that the 508point drop in the stock market on oct 19 would topple 
the country into a recession 
this report presents a good healthy picture of the us 
economy in the first quarter nothing near a recession despite all 
the earlier worries said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co this is good political reading for the republicans 
the administration wasted no time in boasting about the gnp 
report 
so much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the 
first quarter commerce under secretary robert ortner said at a 
briefing for reporters todays report shows the economy entering 
its sixth year of expansion with inflation remaining moderate 
in further good news the growth was accompanied by a slowdown 
in the rate of inflation with a price measure tied to the gnp 
rising at an annual rate of 24 percent down from a 27 percent 
increase in the fourth quarter 
beryl sprinkel the presidents chief economic adviser said 
that the gnp report should allay fears that have cropped up 
recently in financial markets that growing inflationary pressures 
would force the federal reserve board to raise interest rates in 
coming months 
the economy is on track for moderate further expansion and 
restrained inflation in 1988 sprinkel said at a white house 
briefing 
the gnp grew at a much faster 48 percent rate in the 
octoberdecember quarter but analysts said that growth masked some 
dangerous imbalances that were not present in the first quarter 
report 
almost all of the fourth quarter increase in gnp wound up as 
unsold inventory sitting on shelves at the same time consumer 
spending was taking a rare nose dive falling by 25 percent the 
biggest drop in seven years this combination has in the past been 
a harbinger of a recession 
this pattern was reversed in the first quarter with business 
inventories which had risen by 394 billion in the fourth 
quarter falling by 132 billion in the first quarter indicating 
a success by businesses in reducing swollen inventories 
much of the success in working down the inventory bulge occurred 
in auto showrooms as dealers were aided by a new round of sales 
incentives 
this helped boost consumer spending by 236 billion in the 
first quarter a 38 percent annual rate of increase the report 
said more than half of that growth came in auto sales 
business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual 
rate of 325 percent in the first quarter the fastest advance 
since a 395 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1983 
in other good news the countrys trade deficit after removing 
the effects of inflation narrowed by 36 billion in the first 
quarter continuing the trend of improvement that began in mid1986 
the administration which is forecasting that gnp will grow 29 
percent for the full year is counting on further improvements in 
the trade deficit to supply almost half of gnp growth this year 
much of the rest of the increase is expected to come from higher 
business capital spending as companies expand production facilities 
to meet a growing export demand 
both of those trends were evident in todays gnp report 
providing good news for the reagan administration which is 
counting on a sixth straight year of economic growth to boost 
chances for a republican presidential win in november 
in another report the government said that aftertax corporate 
profits rose an even faster 26 percent in the final three months 
of 1987 this was an upward revision from a month ago when the 
government put the increase in business profits at 16 percent 
two factors that held back gnp growth in the first quarter were 
a 94 percent drop in residential construction spending and a 223 
percent drop in spending by the federal government reflecting in 
large part a swing in farm subsidy payments 
the various changes pushed the gnp after adjusting for 
inflation up by 218 billion to a new annual rate of 390 
trillion 
the first quarter growth was welcome news when compared to 
forecasts being made at the beginning of the year at the time 
some analysts were actually predicting that the gnp would decline 
in the first quarter signalling the start of a new recession 
the pessimists believed that a combination of the shock to 
consumer confidence from the stock market collapse and the huge 
overhang of business inventories would severely depress economic 
activity in the early part of this year 
the fear was that after a loss of a trillion dollars in wealth 
nervous consumers would stop spending and manufacturers caught 
with huge inventories of unsold goods would cut back on production 
and lay off workers 
but those events did not occur instead of cutting back after 
the market turmoil employers actually boosted hiring since 
october an average of 362000 new jobs have been added to the 
economy each month more than twice the size of the monthly gains 
before the crash 
the big gains in employment helped restore consumer confidence 
considered critical for the economys health since consumer 
spending accounts for twothirds of economic activity 
the reagan administration is predicting that the gnp will expand 
at a 29 percent annual rate this year marking the third 
consecutive year the economy has grown at this rate 
this view is in line with the outlook of many private 
forecasters as well blue chip economic indicators a sedona ariz 
newsletter said that its latest survey of 51 top economists found 
a consensus forecast for growth of 27 percent this year up 
significantly from a 19 percent gnp estimate made in the month 
following the market crash

presidential candidate jesse jackson told top 
state department officials today that south africa should be 
treated as a terrorist nation because it backs mozambique rebels 
who have allegedly killed 100000 civilians 
the democrat was briefed at the state department on a recent 
study describing systematic abuse and murder by the renamo 
rebels he told reporters that the sponsorship of the rebels by 
south africa defines statesponsored terrorism 
chester crocker assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs joining jackson at a news conference outside the state 
department acknowledged south africas ties to the rebels but he 
declined to characterize south africa as a terrorist state saying 
only that its involvement with renamo goes against a previous 
commitment made by pretoria 
both crocker and jackson described the session this morning 
which included deputy secretary of state john whitehead as a 
briefing session for the candidate 
the study was conducted by state department consultant robert 
gersony and released a week ago jackson siezed on it to underscore 
his call for a change in us policy toward south africa and the 
socalled frontline states around it 
the report was based on gersonys interviews with 196 mozambique 
refugees and numerous relief workers who told of random murders 
rapes burning of villages forced labor mutilation looting and 
beatings by renamo which is trying to bring down mozambiques 
marxistled government 
it is conservatively estimated that 100000 civilians may have 
been murdered by renamo in this manner the report concluded 
jackson challenged his democratic opponent massachusetts gov 
michael dukakis and vice president george bush to also 
characterize south africa as a terrorist state 
he also called for an increase in humanitarian aid to the 
frontline states and for a congressional delegation to visit 
mozambique and report to president reagan on conditions there 
jackson has sought to make south africa and african affairs part 
of the presidential campaign debate but other candidates have not 
made it an issue 
earlier today jackson met at capitol hill with congress members 
and ambassadors of the frontline states on the issue 
some conservative members of congress have called for us aid 
to renamo but the united states officially supports the mozambican 
government

the parties nationwide vote proportions 
the korean news agency yonhap predicted that rohs party would 
fail to win a majority earlier predictions said the governing 
party would triumph because of divisions within the opposition 
opposition control of the legislature would have added impact 
under a new constitution that took effect in february when roh 
started a fiveyear term after winning office in december with 36 
percent of the vote

after widespread antigovernment demonstrations gives the assembly 
powers to investigate government actions the president no longer 
can dissolve the legislature which has a fouryear term 
todays protests followed a report monday by one television 
station that democratic justice party candidate hyun kyungdae had 
won a seat on southern cheju island with 39 percent of the vote

the leader of an american expedition in 
the himalayas said tuesday his missing colleague had fallen or 
frozen to death after reaching the top of 23488foot mount pumori 
chris leibindgut 27 of wasilla alaska has been missing since 
april 18 the day he and expedition leader john tuckey reached the 
top of the mountain 
either chris fell to death or froze or both said tuckey of 
girdwood alaska we could not find his body so we presume 
he has got to be dead right now 
according to tuckey leibindgut disappeared at 640 pm two 
hours after the two had reached the summit at a place about 148 
feet below the highest point 
at the summit chris complained of dizziness and was acting 
confused he said so we descended a short way below the 
summit 
it became dark and very windy he continued so i 
started to dig a snow cave for us in preparation for spending the 
night there while i was digging chris wandered off and walked 
away i have not seen him since then 
tuckey 37 said he spent the night alone in the snow cave and 
the next day descended the east ridge of the mountain 
on april 11 the two had started climbing the southern ridge of 
the peak accompanied by doug white 27 of walnut creek calif 
and randy kopal 38 of eldorado springs colo the group left 
their base camp at the 17318foot level without the help of sherpa 
guides setting up their first camp the same day and a second camp 
the following day white and kopal then returned to base camp 
they were moving slowly tuckey said we thought we would 
have a better chance of success if we moved faster so chris and i 
continued we went in alpine style no fixed ropes even that is 
why we had to go fast 
during the climb tuckey and leigindgut spent some nights in 
snow caves and one night in the open without shelter 
tuckey said the toes on his right foot became frostbitten during 
the climb but he believed they would be ok

essex video once one of the nations biggest 
makers of hardcore adult films has filed for bankruptcy while its 
president faces federal charges 
essex based in the suburban san fernando valley claimed in an 
april 5 bankruptcy filing that it has no assets and more than 100 
creditors including film director john derek husband of actress 
bo derek essex owes derek 6500 in royalties from a film titled 
love you that he made in the mid 1970s 
what happened to essexs films and licenses is a mystery 
former essex salesman eugene marino has started a new adult 
video company called essex west which took over essexs 
headquarters and has thousands of videocassettes in its warehouse 
but marino insists essex west has no connection to essex 
i have a silent partner he said refusing to identify that 
person 
essex along with caballero home video and video company of 
america also both based in the san fernando valley were at one 
time considered the big three in the pornographic film industry 
said sgt don smith of the police departments vice unit 
the adult film industry generated 750 million in sales in the 
los angeles area alone last year smith said 
but essex which reportedly had annual sales of 40 million just 
a few years ago was driven into financial trouble by high 
production costs said jared rutter editor of the trade 
publication film world reports 
essex put too much money into production said rutter 
adding that it also had its share of flop movies 
the companys president jeff steinman is to appear thursday in 
federal court in memphis tenn on 16 counts of shipping obscene 
materials through united parcel service 
the justice department alleges that since 1982 steinman was 
shipping what the agency described as obscene videos across state 
lines a federal offense 
steinman 30 was quoted in tuesdays editions of the los 
angeles times as saying he would plead guilty to the charges 
however he denied that essex produced pornographic films a 
violation of californias pandering laws if the movies are made in 
the state 
essex was founded in hollywood in the late 1960s by colombian 
immigrant joe steinman who bought the rights to adult films and 
sold copies to theaters nationwide he retired in 1979 turning 
over the business to his son jeff 
the company quickly expanded into the home video market in the 
late 1970s when videocasette recorders became popular transferring 
its huge film library to tape 
but intense competition drove the price of videos down marino 
said 
today there are tapes selling for 5 that were selling for 42 
two years ago he said

two of britains leading newspapers on tuesday 
appealed to israel to spare the life of john demjanjuk sentenced 
to hang for war crimes committed as concentration camp guard ivan 
the terrible 
but two swiss papers took the opposite line saying the sentence 
was justified given the thousands of jewish deaths ascribed to 
demjanjuk 
some european papers highlighted the cheers and singing that 
broke out in the public gallery when the judges announced the 
sentence 
singing and insults greet demjanjuk death sentence 
headlined the independent in london its competitor the times 
said cheers and dancing at end of ivan trial 
the conservative times editorialized that the death penalty 
arouses misgivings but said that since the sentence appeared 
to be little more than a formality it is to the credit of the 
judges that they deliberated for three hours before pronouncing 
sentence 
it added if the israeli authorities could see their way to 
commuting the death sentence this would further mark the emergence 
of israel as the civilized state it aspires to be there could be 
few more appropriate ways in which israel could mark the 40th 
anniversary of its foundation 
the conservative daily telegraph commented that in israel the 
trials of war criminals assist an explicitly political and 
propagandist purpose to remind the world until the end of time of 
the nature of the holocaust and what was done to the jewish 
people 
it added yet even for israel in this 40th year of its 
existence there must come a moment when it is time to look 
forward not to forget the holocaust but to cauterize its terrible 
wounds 
the telegraph said if israel is convinced of his guilt then 
let him rot in his cell but it claimed the evidence against 
demjanjuk was flawed and executing him could conceivably do as 
much harm to the jewish nation today as ivan the terrible did to 
individual jews 
in switzerland the independent basler zeitung commented 
given the atrocities he has been convicted of the sentence is of 
secondary importance no punishment can render justice in his 
case 
the conservative neue zurcher zeitung agreed saying one 
could argue that it would be wiser to sentence a person whose 
identity is only 99 percent sure to life imprisonment instead of 
to death but there is no third between guilt and innocence and 
the crimes committed justify the sentence imposed according to 
israeli law 
alfred emmerlich a legal expert with west germanys opposition 
social democratic party told the general anzeiger newspaper in 
bonn that his party condemns the death penalty in general 
including in israel 
there is always the possibility of a mistake and there is no 
way to correct such a mistake when the death penalty has been 
carried out 
in the netherlands rabbi avraham soetendorp said he welcomed 
the death sentence as a symbol but did not want it carried out 
i face a certain conflict of conscience because i am opposed 
to capital punishment he told the associated press 
soetendorp a prominent dutch lobbyist for jewish causes said 
demjanjuk should be jailed for life 
its a good thing the trials finally over and that its 
become clear that he demjanjuk really is ivan the terrible he 
said 
reporting from jerusalem for le figaro of paris rene bauduc 
wrote that if demjanjuk lost his appeal to the israeli supreme 
court he would hang carrying away with him the memory of the 
horrors of an epoch but also the doubts of all those who looking 
at this man of peaceful appearance have difficulty believing he 
could have committed such crimes

michael dukakis swept to an easy victory 
over jesse jackson in the utah presidential caucuses preparing for 
todays delegaterich pennsylvania primary by collecting a large 
majority of utahs 23 democratic delegates 
unofficial results with 94 percent of the vote counted in monday 
nights caucuses showed dukakis with 7550 votes or 71 percent 
compared with 1682 or 16 percent for jackson some 1231 voters 
or 11 percent were uncommitted 
those percentages would leave dukakis with 19 utah delegates to 
the democratic national convention and jackson with four 
were really happy said dukakis state campaign coordinator 
gary knoblock its a long way from home to be winning by this 
kind of margin weve been slowly climbing in the west but this 
took a quantum leap 
complete statewide returns were not expected until late today 
campaign aides touted the victory as another sign that dukakis 
had momentum going into todays pennsylvania primary where 178 
delegates are at stake and the massachusetts governor has been 
heavily favored in polls 
jackson supporters meanwhile said they were pleased to have 
come away with any delegates from a state where 93 percent of the 
population is white and less than 1 percent is black a candidate 
must get at least 15 percent of the vote to qualify for a share of 
the delegates 
the votes that came in for jackson were certainly not 
allinclusive minority votes i feel very good about what weve 
done said jackson state chairman marvin davis 
in 1984 jackson won only 4 percent of the vote here 
counting the three super delegates who have endorsed him 
dukakis total utah count would be 22 delegates national 
committeewoman norma matheson rep wayne owens and state party 
chairman randy horiuchi have endorsed dukakis while national 
committeeman and former gov calvin rampton and elizabeth willey 
remain uncommitted 
dukakis also had the endorsement in the caucuses of former 
democratic gov scott matheson 
of the 23 delegates apportioned in monday nights binding 
balloting 20 will be elected at the state convention in june and 
three will be elected separately by the state partys central 
committee 
in addition to the presidential poll those attending the 
caucuses elected delegates to county conventions next month and 
voted for precinct captains 
republicans had planned a nonbinding presidential preference 
vote but abandoned the idea after vice president george bush 
virtually locked up the gop nomination instead republicans voted 
on their preference for vice president and whether they favor 
holding a western regional primary in 1992 similar to the souths 
super tuesday this year 
results of the republican balloting will not be available for 
several days 
horiuchi said the turnout estimated at more than 10000 was 
considerably better than 1984 when only 6000 to 7000 attended 
what were then called mass meetings

the democratic presidential candidates 
have left behind pennsylvania but the big industry problems that 
plague that state follow the campaign into the next round of 
primaries in ohio and indiana 
frontrunner michael dukakis held solid leads over jesse jackson 
in polls of voter sentiment leading up to next tuesdays primaries 
in those midwestern states 
however the jackson forces were hoping their candidate would be 
helped in ohio by the efforts of gerald austin his campaign 
manager who helped steer the successful campaigns of gov richard 
celeste in 1982 and 1986 
the district of columbia also holds its primary next tuesday 
and mayor marion barry jr predicts jackson could win as much as 70 
percent of the democratic vote in the city that gave jackson one of 
his few 1984 victories 
in ohio dukakis and jackson were expected to keep hitting hard 
at such issues as plant closings and a need for government to help 
create new jobs jacksons first appearance in the state was at a 
steel plant 
dukakis already well ahead of jackson in the delegate count 
could add to the increasing sense of inevitability about his 
nomination if he could win the lions share of the 159 democratic 
delegates at stake in ohio and the 79 in indiana 
but jackson was beginning a full week of campaigning in ohio on 
tuesday and dukakis aides were speaking as if they were taking 
nothing for granted 
weve got a tough job cut out for us in ohio said anne 
drake director of dukakis ohio campaign i dont think there is 
any way to possibly downplay the effect that jerry austin will have 
on ohios primary 
linda brown a jackson spokeswoman agreed saying its 
certainly an asset for us because of jerrys visibility here in the 
ohio area and his track record with past ohio campaigns 
still state rep cj mclin of dayton jacksons ohio campaign 
chairman said im not fooling myself its going to be 
difficult but i still think we have a chance 
a gallup poll conducted april 810 showed dukakis leading 
jackson in ohio 50 percent to 23 percent 
dukakis also holds a comfortable lead in most recent polls in 
indiana an indianapolis star survey taken april 1719 showed him 
favored by 49 percent to 21 percent for jackson 
ohio democratic leaders have generally taken no stands on the 
race unlike four years ago when most endorsed walter mondale 
only to see gary hart win a narrow victory in the primary 
dukakis name will appear on ballots throughout ohio but 
jackson failed to qualify delegate slates in three of the states 
21 congressional districts two largely rural districts with few 
black voters and a district west of cleveland 
although democrats hold both us senate seats and virtually 
every statewide office in ohio the state has been friendly 
territory for ronald reagan in 1984 reagan won the state with 59 
percent of the vote 
herbert b asher an ohio state university political science 
professor said i think two major things the candidates need to 
keep in mind are that the state really has eight major media 
markets it is a difficult state to campaign in because there is no 
single dominant area 
i think the other thing that really is new to the democrats is 
that it finally is down to a twoperson contest that means 
then that dukakis and jackson are campaigning against each other 
in the republican primary 88 delegates are up for grabs in ohio 
and 30 in indiana most of them expected to move into vice 
president george bushs column as he smoothly sails toward the gop 
convention 
in the district of columbia 11 delegates will be directly 
chosen in the democratic primary a contest that jackson has 
virtually nailed down in the heavily black city

a spill at a shell oil co refinery has 
left dozens of birds and marsh animals coated with crude oil during 
nesting season in the wildlife haven of the suisun bay marshland 
by monday about 100 oiled birds including egrets avocets 
cinnamon teals mallard ducks grebes herons and endangered 
clapper rail birds had been rescued and taken to centers in 
berkeley and walnut creek for cleaning said brian hunter of the 
state department of fish and game 
in another california oil industry development a federal judge 
has decided that local ordinances did not violate federal 
regulations in a ruling that threw out 10 of 13 oil industry claims 
against cities and counties attempting to control offshore drilling 
the birds were trapped after 21000 gallons of thick unrefined 
crude gushed saturday from martinez shell refinery holding tank 
30 miles northeast of san francisco 
the oil coats the birds feathers leaving them unable to keep 
warm or move around 
also threatened are the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse and 
such marsh creatures as tortoises muskrats and otters volunteers 
have reported a dozen dead muskrats several oilcoated turtles and 
a dead heron 
state officials said monday they planned to sacrifice a section 
of suisun bay marshland in order to save hundreds more acres of 
wetlands 
were trying to keep new areas from becoming oiled said 
hunter 
by monday a slick stretched 10 miles from port costa east to 
ryer island 
six vessels with oil skimmers and 16 vacuum tanktrucks were 
sent to capture oil but coast guard spokesman ken massey estimated 
it could take until next week to clean up the oil 
shell said it traced the spill to a damaged drain on a tank on 
the west side of interstate 680 
massey said shell will have to pay for the damage including new 
paint for the bottoms of hundreds of pleasure boats 
in the offshore drilling case us district judge consuelo b 
marshall ruled in los angeles that in 10 cases the local ordinances 
did not challenge federal supremacy as the oil industry had claimed 
the judge in a decision made public monday said further 
examination of the evidence was necessary to determine if 
ordinances in three areas might violate the commerce clause of the 
constitution 
the western oil and gas association and national ocean 
industries association filed suit last august 
western oil contended in the suit that the local ordinances 
would create a wall from the mexican border to the oregon state 
line blocking development of oil in the outer continental shelf 
development would be hindered by severe restrictions on onshore 
support facilities such as pipelines and processing plants 
according to the suit 
but the judge ruled the ordinances are not true obstacles to 
commerce 
by implication the judge has recognized the local governments 
have good reason to be concerned about the impacts and effects 
onshore facilities can have on the quality of their environments 
said johanna wald attorney for the san franciscobased natural 
resources defense council which helped fight the claim 
western oil spokesman robert getts said he didnt know if the 
two associations would appeal the decision

the communist party chief in soviet georgia was 
fired because of public protests about contaminated water that 
caused an outbreak of typhoid fever in which 121 people were 
hospitalized it was reported tuesday 
no one died in the outbreak earlier this month in the city of 
tskhinvali about 45 miles northwest of the georgian capital of 
tbilisi according to the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda 
the first secretary of the regional communist party fs 
sanakoev was fired at a regional party meeting saturday a week 
after protesters gathered in front of party headquarters to 
complain about the water komsomolskaya pravda said 
it said that 87 percent of the people who responded to a march 
31 survey said the inadequate water supply was the citys main 
problem 
in the best circumstances there is only water in the homes in 
the mornings and the evenings often there is none at all 
komsomolskaya pravda said 
the representative of the georgian regional government appointed 
a commission to propose a plan for improving the citys water 
supply but the protesters were not satisfied with the offer 
the soviet news agency tass said regional leaders had been 
negligent in not ensuring that a new water supply long under 
construction be put into service 
the first patient was hospitalized with what was diagnosed as 
typhoid on april 2 and the outbreak reached its peak between april 
11 and 15 when 121 people were hospitalized according to the 
newspaper socialist industry

a congressional watchdog agency says the air 
force has provided billions of dollars worth of parts and supplies 
to defense contractors without adequate control over how the 
material is used 
the general accounting office in a report issued monday 
estimated air force contractors were given more than 6 billion in 
government furnished material during 1986 the most recent year 
for which complete statistics are available 
that material covers an enormous range of items from major 
parts for airplanes and other equipment down to such items as 
brooms paint and bolts 
normally the materials are supposed to be provided by 
contractors but the pentagon has the option of supplying the 
materials when it is in the governments best interest 
the gao said the service should tighten up its administrative 
procedures to avoid the problem

seven years after it was signed as a teaty a 
bill providing for the prompt return of children abducted from a 
parent and taken to another country has won final approval by the 
house 
the measure approved on monday by voice vote would implement 
an international treaty on child abduction that the united states 
signed in 1981 and the senate approved five years later 
the house which had passed an almost identical bill march 28 
approved on monday a slightly different senate version giving 
jurisdiction over international child abduction cases to both state 
and federal courts 
the measure is intended to remove difficult timeconsuming 
legal issues involved in returning children abducted to another 
country often by the other parent or helping foreign parents

the reagan administration today affirmed its 
determination to push a 460 million arms purchase by saudi arabia 
through congress with the argument that improving awacs radar 
planes is essential to protect us navy forces in the persian gulf 
a bipartisan group of 187 house members has written secretary of 
state george p shultz opposing the sale of advanced equipment in 
light of the saudis recent secret purchase of missiles from china 
that could devastate israel 
but charles e redman the state department spokesman said the 
saudis have offered assurances the missiles would not be 
nucleararmed 
we have not changed our view that the awacs maintenance 
package is critical to our gulf policy he said the saudi 
awacs operation provides important support for the us mission in 
the gulf including protection of us navy personnel 
american warships are protecting kuwaiti oil tankers outfitted 
with us flags in the tanker war between iran and iraq a number 
of clashes with iran have resulted 
we expect to go forward with the formal notification in the 
near term redman said 
rep charles schumer dny said 186 other house members had 
signed a letter he wrote urging secretary of state george p shultz 
to withdraw the proposed sale the letter was to be forwarded to 
shultz today after additional signatures were gathered 
schumer made the announcement monday after learning the state 
department planned to serve notice later that day of the proposed 
sale said spokesman jay genachowski formal notification 
subsequently was postponed he said 
state department spokesman dennis harter said the administration 
had made no decision on when to formally notify congress of the 
arms sales but that officials were doing some consultations on 
the proposal particularly since there has been some evidence of 
congressional concern 
congress has 30 days to pass legislation to block the arms sale 
once it is formally announced 
those signing the letter maintained it would be rewarding saudi 
deceit to allow such a sale after recent disclosures that the 
saudis had secretly purchased mediumrange ballistic missiles from 
china 
saudi arabia meanwhile today decided to sign the nuclear 
weapons nonproliferation treaty the decision as reported by the 
saudi press agency is an apparent effort to reassure the united 
states that it will not try to arm its css2 missiles with nuclear 
warheads 
the decision also could blunt israels allegations that the 
missiles constituted a threat to its safety 
the letter expresses concern that the saudis went to such 
lengths to conceal the missile purchase from the united states 
in a separate letter sent earlier 58 senators urged shultz to 
rethink the proposed sale of bradley fighting vehicles tow 
missiles and ground support equipment for awacs earlywarning 
aircraft 
the house members letter says it is us policy to sustain 
israels advantage in quality of arms over the advantage in numbers 
possessed by more heavily populated arab neighbors

the united states has expressed concern to the 
philippine government and its congress regarding proposed 
legislation that would ban nuclear weapons in the philippines the 
state department said tuesday 
the legislation on which debate began in manila this week 
would prohibit nuclear weapons at the two major us military bases 
in the philippines and would ban port calls by us warships and 
planes carrying such arms 
state department spokesman charles redman said the united states 
had told the philippines that the bill would permit no 
flexibility on nuclear matters and would be incompatible with 
us policy 
that policy prohibits the united states from revealing whether 
its ships and planes are carrying nuclear weapons 
redman declined to further discuss the philippine legislation 
saying it was still in its early stages the bill is expected to 
pass the 23member senate but would face strong opposition in the 
200member lower house 
the united states has expressed strong opposition to such bans 
in other countries it expelled new zealand from a pacific defense 
alliance with australia after new zealand adopted a nuclear ban 
and has protested similar action being considered in denmark

engineers today lifted a giant oven lid to 
check a mirror that astronomers hope will lead to the next 
generation of super telescopes and the huge piece of cooling glass 
was pronounced just fine 
i dont know how nervous you are but im certainly feeling 
it peter strittmatter director of the university of arizonas 
steward observatory said monday after engineers began spincasting 
glass into what they hope will become a honeycombed 11foot mirror 
the largest ever to be made in that manner 
colleague roger angel is credited with the idea that he and 
other steward astronomers hoped would bear fruit 
the first 24 hours during which the mirror actually is molded 
are the most critical strittmatter said monday he said scientists 
were lifting the lid today to get a view of a redhot product 
strittmatter said today the mirror apparently formed without any 
problems but that engineers and astronomers will have to wait the 
six weeks until they know for certain whether the mirror was 
successfully produced 
so far so good angel said the trick is to get it from 
this temperature about 1470 degrees fahrenheit down to room 
temperature in one piece 
the mirror a prototype for more powerful telescopes than now 
exist is to be sited at the astrophysical research consortium 
arc telescope being built in the sacramento mountains near sun 
spot nm 
arc is a joint project of five universities the university of 
chicago princeton new mexico state university of washington and 
washington state 
the goal is obviously to make much bigger mirrors than we have 
ever been able to make before strittmatter said 
traditional big mirrors have weighed four to five times more 
than the two tons the finished 11foot mirror will be and have 
required as many as two or three years to grind and polish he said 
in addition they are slow to adjust to outside air temperature 
making for blurred images and require large support structures and 
buildings to house them he said 
the new technology offers many advantages angel and 
strittmatter said combined with a new technique for polishing the 
glass blank with a more deeply curved surface the mirror being 
cast and those to follow will have short focal lengths resulting in 
great cost savings through smaller buildings for the telescopes 
they added 
domed telescopes thus could become a thing of the past said 
donald york of the university of chicago 
strittmatter said the advances have spurred renewed worldwide 
interest in astronomical research with several new major 
telescopes planned including a binocularlike telescope with twin 
26foot mirrors called the columbus project that would be the 
worlds most powerful telescope collaborators include italian 
astronomers the universities of arizona and chicago and ohio state 
university 
mirrors of 26 feet in diameter are considered the current limit 
given atmospheric distortion strittmatter said the honeycombed 
understructure which makes for lightweight yet rigid construction 
helps minimize the distortion he said 
thermal temperatures of the mirror can be controlled much more 
effectively than in conventional telescope mirrors he said 
in the steward mirror lab beneath the stands of the 
universitys football stadium the 19foot furnace began spinning 
about 8 times a minute once its temperature reached 705 degrees 
celsius or about 1300 degrees fahrenheit the furnace began 
heating late saturday 
lab workers cast a 4foot mirror in november with the same 
spinning furnace

michael dukakis met jesse jackson in the 
peaceful pennsylvania primary on tuesday as he bid to lengthen his 
lead in convention delegates and certify his status as democratic 
presidential frontrunner george bush sought the final delegates 
needed to clinch the republican nomination 
dukakis led jackson by far in the preelection polls after a 
weeklong campaign that looked and sounded more like a mutual 
admiration society than the typical 1988 democratic primary brawl 
aides hoped the massachusetts governor would win the popular 
vote impressively and claim as many as 150 of the 178 democratic 
national convention delegates at stake 
jackson had scant hopes for a popular vote victory in 
pennsylvania and already was looking ahead to next weeks 
primaries in the district of columbia indiana and ohio his 
chances in the delegate hunt were little better since his campaign 
failed to file a complete slate of delegate candidates around the 
state 
dukakis looked to the pennsylvania returns as the final count 
was tallied from his victory in utahs monday night caucuses the 
new englander was ahead for 19 of 23 delegates at stake 
dukakis began the day with 109515 delegates to 8401 for 
jackson it takes 2081 to gain the nomination at the democratic 
national convention in july in atlanta 
bush had 1081 of the 1139 needed to nominate former 
television evangelist pat robertson who has ceased active 
campaigning had 31 
were putting bush over the top pennsylvania state chairman 
earl baker said even before the polls closed were going to do 
the same thing in november he added 
bushs nomination has been all but assurred since he routed his 
republican rivals across the south on super tuesday last month and 
his aides have been working for weeks on their strategy for the gop 
convention in new orleans and for the fall campaign against the 
democrats 
the vice president has been running virtually uncontested for 
weeks winning primaries and caucuses as they rolled by on the 
calendar and methodically claiming virtually all of the delegates 
available 
he needed to win only 58 of the 78 pennsylvania delegates at 
stake to amass a nominating majority in the associated press count 
in contrast dukakis didnt take on the air of prohibitive 
frontrunner until a week ago when he scored a decisive victory in 
the new york primary and knocked sen albert gore jr from the race 
that left only himself and jackson as active candidates in the 
oncecrowded democratic race and his aides said they hoped for a 
string of victories that would yield enough delegates to claim the 
nomination by the time the primary season ends on june 7

congress never intended to allow states to 
challenge other states air pollution control plans in efforts to 
reduce the precursors of acid rain the justice department told a 
federal appeals court tuesday 
justice department attorney michael mccord said the 
environmental protection agency thus has no duty to order a group 
of midwestern states at the behest of a coalition of northeastern 
states to force pollution reductions on coalburning utilities and 
other sources 
in the section of the clean air act relied on by the 
northeastern states in a petition to the epa there is no 
reference to a state pollution control implementation plan 
congress intent was to focus on a source or group of sources 
that might cause air pollution across a state line not an entire 
state or group of states mccord told a threejudge panel of the 
us circuit court of appeals 
he said there was nothing in the history of the legislation 
giving epa the duty to act against entire states when other states 
complain 
the panel was hearing arguments for the second time in a lawsuit 
brought against epa by maine new hampshire vermont connecticut 
massachusetts new york pennsylvania and new jersey 
the first argument in december 1985 had to be disregarded 
because two of the three judges that heard it left the court 
antonin scalia to join the supreme court and robert h bork by 
resignation after the senate rejected his nomination to the supreme 
court 
tuesdays court hearing fell in the middle of three days of 
rallies and news conferences arranged by environmental groups 
seeking action against acid rain timed to coincide with the visit 
wednesday of canadian prime minister brian mulroney who also has 
been pressing the administration to reduce the northbound flow of 
air pollution from the united states that causes acid rain 
as part of those events the international maple syrup institute 
said at a news conference us syrup production had fallen 45 
percent since 1981 and acid rain was the prime suspect 
a 19851986 aerial survey of 27000 square miles of quebec maple 
stands showed 4 percent of the trees had lost more than 25 percent 
of their leaves and were doomed to die and 44 percent had lost 11 
percent to 25 percent of their leaves and were badly damaged the 
institute said 
though researchers are still seeking the cause of maple decline 
there is unquestionably a significant correlation between the 
death of maple trees and acid rain institute president david 
scanlan said 
the institute and the american forestry association both called 
for enactment of pending revisions to the clean air act that would 
institute an acid rain control program and other measures but r 
neil sampson executive vice president of the forestry association 
said for me to say how much acid rain is affecting syrup 
production is something i cant do 
the northeastern states are appealing epas rejection of their 
petition requesting the agency to order revisions in the air 
pollution control plans of michigan ohio indiana kentucky 
tennessee west virginia and illinois to reduce emissions of sulfur 
dioxide a principal precursor of acid rain 
there are no federal laws on acid rain so the complaining 
states had to argue that pennsylvania maine and new york could not 
meet various other federal air quality standards because of the 
midwestern sulfur dioxide 
the clean air act has a section requiring the epa administrator 
to make sure that one states air pollution control plan does not 
cause impermissible pollution in another state before he approves 
the plan or revisions to it 
in answering the northeastern petitions epa said it did not 
know enough to tell the allegedly offending states how to revise 
their plans 
for the northeastern states greg sample of the maine attorney 
generals office argued that opponents were overestimating the 
effects of granting the petition 
it is not fair to say that our petition seeks to evaluate all 
sources or even all major sources of sulfur dioxide he said 
we have constantly urged the administrator of epa to 
concentrate on the 50 major sources in the midwest

dukakis and jackson debated twice in their pennsylvania primary 
campaign treating one another with exceptional good humor while 
attacking bush and the reagan administration 
the democratic rivals held their hands aloft like prizefighters 
in a gesture of unity at one debate and proceeded to joke about the 
vice presidential slot on the ticket the no 1 topic on the minds 
of democrats everywhere 
are you interested dukakis asked jackson in a soft 
backstage voice 
dukakis even held a private meeting during the week with some of 
jacksons black supporters in pennsylvania with his rivals 
advance knowledge and approval 
said jackson however it goes when its all said and done 
we will come out of the convention as a unit to send the 
reaganbush forces back to private life 
dukakis also began pointing his attack toward the republicans 
during the week saying it would be a tragedy if reagan vetoed 
a trade bill over a provision requiring companies to give notice 
before closing manufacturing facilities 
jackson got entangled the last two days of the campaign in a 
flap over how to deal with terrorists particularly in situations 
where they were holding americans hostage 
in a speech sunday in washington dc jackson took issue with 
dukakis hardline statements opposed to negotiations with 
terrorists 
i disagree with that said jackson if i could get the 
hostages out id do it 
the next day he was peppered with questions about whether he was 
implying he would make concessions to hostagetakers 
he rejected what he called material concessions such as 
selling arms but he added i choose negotiation over blind 
bloody confrontation and said he would consider allowing 
terrorists safe passage in exchange for release of hostages 
he also said if we are going to deter terrorism we are going 
to have to address the underlying caucses of terrorism terrorism 
does not emerge out of the blue 
bush promised to continue showing the flag in the remainder 
of the primary season despite his certain nonmination and he had 
a feisty rejoinder when hecklers dogged him at one stop in 
pennsylvania 
im glad to see the jackson supporters here or maybe the mike 
dukakis supporters he said i welcome then in debate and i 
will welcome taking on their ticket and we will beat them in the 
fall 
bushs aides said the vice president might soon begin focusing 
his criticism more specifically on dukakis and less on democrats in 
general campaign manager lee atwater provided a preview when he 
described the democratic frontrunner as a northern fried jimmy 
carter the man turned out of office in 1980 by the reaganbush 
ticket 
bushs spokesman also said the vice president intends to summon 
republican governors and experts to his home in kennebunkport 
maine for a weeklong brainstorming session in june to help shape 
the foreign policy and economic issues for the fall campaign

steven hadley ditched his wife and job 
in iowa five years ago and started a secret life here with a new 
wife but he attracted police curiosity when he paid cash for a 
house and expensive cars 
police lt gary edwards finally unraveled the mystery 
surrounding hadley after seeing his picture on an fbi flier issued 
in connection with the television series unsolved mysteries 
authorities said hadley 40 was arrested monday and accused of 
embezzling 11 million from the john deere employees credit union 
in waterloo iowa where he had worked for 10 years and was 
described as a reliable and respected employee 
us magistrate george kelt today ordered hadley held without 
bond at least until a detention hearing which was scheduled for 
friday afternoon fbi spokesman johnie joyce said 
hadley admitted his identity following his arrest said 
nicholas v ohara fbi special agent in charge of the district 
office at omaha neb 
fbi agents and police called hadley and asked him to come to the 
police station to discuss a neighborhood juvenile case that hadley 
and his new wife had reported 
i showed him the flier and asked him if he was hadley and he 
answered yes i am edwards said there was a big sigh of 
relief and then he said ill cooperate fully however i can 
hadley was reported missing by his wife and family in july 1983 
the same time the money disappeared from the credit union 
authorities believe hadley took a july 21 flight to chicago but 
were unable to track him he called home to alert his wife to a 
letter he left behind saying he took the money and fled because he 
could no longer cope with home and work pressures 
in part of the letter included in federal court documents 
hadley wrote to his wife that this is a very difficult letter to 
write but i couldnt let you find out from someone else first if i 
call you to read this letter it means that i have successfully 
left the state with around 1 million from the credit union 
in iowa his wife kathryn has divorced him and retained 
custody of their three children who were 11 7 and a year old 
when their father disappeared 
for the past three years edwards and others at the friendswood 
police department have been researching hadley after he bought a 
home and two expensive sports cars in cash but had no visible 
means of support 
edwards said hadley had been in friendswood south of houston 
since 1984 when he bought his house a ferrari and an alfa romeo 
we did a reverse investigation edwards said we 
researched how he came into a lot of money when he bought his 
house and fancy cars in cash people were suspicious 
there was no doubt in my mind it was him when i saw the 
flier he said i was shocked i probably have 600 pages of 
reports on this guy from the last three years and he looks the 
same 
hadley has since remarried and edwards says the new wife had no 
idea of hadleys real identity 
he is being held pending an appearance before a us magistrate 
hopes of catching hadley rose in february when producers of the 
nbctvs unsolved mysteries arrived in waterloo to prepare for 
a segment on the missing cash and credit union employee 
the hadley segment was scheduled to be broadcast next month 
during the show viewers are provided with a telephone number to 
call if they can identify a photo of the subject

the bronze cowboy sculpture the rattlesnake 
by famed western artist frederic remington stopped museum visitor 
cy baumgartner in his tracks the cowboys tiny spurs were on 
upside down 
theres no way a cowboy would wear his spurs pointing up like 
that said baumgartner a former rodeo cowboy who now drives a 
beer truck and raises quarter horses it would be totally out of 
character 
baumgartner who was touring the remington exhibit sunday at the 
st louis art museum apparently was the first to notice the error 
i saw it immediately he said i just think its funny 
that nobody noticed it before now 
after baumgartner pointed out the problem museum workers 
checked other bronzes on display 
they found that all the spurs on the four horsemen in a casting 
of coming through the rye were also upside down 
peter h hassrick one of the curators of the exhibit said he 
has occasionally noticed similar problems with remington works in 
private collections he said he hadnt noticed the problem in the 
st louis exhibit 
but that doesnt necessarily mean that remington the famed 
sculptor and painter of western themes who lived from 1861 to 1909 
made the error 
the spurs on the bronzes and other small pieces were cast 
separately from the main work and as a result it was sometimes 
left to a foundry worker with little knowledge of a cowboys gear 
to attach the spurs to the boots 
on other occasions hassrick said the spurs may have been 
damaged and replacement spurs attached turned the wrong way 
its just a silly little thing but im sure remington wold 
have liked to have seen them the right way hassrick said 
if they were on one of our bronzes wed turn them around 
said hassrick director of the buffalo bill historical center in 
cody wyo and an authority on remington 
neither of the works in question however is owned by the 
museum the rattlesnake casting is from a private collection 
and the casting of coming through the rye is on loan from 
princeton university 
the exhibit is open in st louis through may 22

two navy navigational 
satellites that put on a spectacular light show after launch 
reached their planned circular polar orbit tuesday officials at 
this coastal base said 
a nasa consultant at vandenberg don forney said the launch 
aboard a scout rocket monday evening went by the numbers 
forney said solar panels that charge the batteries powering the 
satellite were deployed on one of the satellites shortly after it 
reached orbit the spare satellite will be stored in orbit until 
needed the functional satellite will be operational in 10 days 
the oscar satellites each weighing 131 pounds are used as a 
navigational system for submarines and commercial shipping as well 
as in oil and mineral deposit work 
their 657 pm launch left an exhaust contrail clearly visible 
from malibu about 100 miles to the south 
the contrail was the result of a twilight phenomenon said 
master sgt bruce zielsdorf a vandenberg spokesman 
it is the result of spent fuel from the booster rocket as it 
travels through the upper atmosphere the fuel combines with water 
droplets that crystallize he said 
those crystals are struck by highaltitude sunlight he 
added it may be dark on earth but theres still sunlight above 
it causes an aurora borealis effect and is usually visible for 15 
to 20 minutes 
the contrail which reflected shades of blue and green over 
orange county resembled a giant pretzel in that area after it was 
blown by highaltitude winds

accused drug kingpin carlos lehder 
rivas virtually admitted his guilt in radio and television 
interviews given in 1983 and 1985 federal prosecutors claimed 
tuesday as they argued for the interviews to be presented at his 
trial 
but defense attorney jose quinon arguing against allowing the 
jury to see and hear the tapes claimed that lehder 38 was being 
tried for his political views instead of the 11count indictment 
the indictment alleges lehder and codefendant jack reed 
conspired to smuggle some 33 tons of cocaine into the united 
states from colombia 
defense and prosecution attorneys went linebyline over 
transcripts of a radio interview and a television interview lehder 
gave in late june 1983 before he was indicted in us courts and 
a jungle television interview given in february 1985 when lehder 
was a fugitive on the charges for which he is now being tried 
the jury was excused during the arguments 
the entire statement amounts to a confession said us 
attorney robert w merkle when discussing a section of the radio 
transcript that dealt with lehders activities on the island of 
normans cay in the bahamas 
this is his manifesto said merkle who added that lehder 
equated his cocaine smuggling with the liquor smuggling in the 
united states during the prohibition era 
this is a very eloquent statement that mr lehder is in 
fact guilty said merkle after reviewing the transcript of the 
audio tape 
quinon charged that certain parts of the tapes are highly 
prejudicial and should not be admitted into evidence 
this has become a political trial nothing more nothing 
less said quinon 
this is not a political trial this is not a political 
crime answered merkle who added that lehder smuggled drugs to 
further his political views 
it now appears that the prosecution may rest its case on 
thursday us district judge howell w melton said he may recess 
most of wednesday to allow him to determine whether the tapes 
which are in spanish can be admitted into evidence 
lehder is charged with conspiracy possession of cocaine with 
intent to distribute importation of cocaine and operating a 
continuing criminal enterprise reed 57 of san pedro calif is 
charged only with being a member of the smuggling conspiracy

political leaders are telling danes 
to choose in upcoming elections between nato allies and the 
countrys longstanding ban on nuclear weapons 
prime minister poul schlueter a nato backer called the 
parliamentary elections for may 10 urging voters to take a 
stand in favor of the western military alliance 
the sudden storm over denmarks role in the 16nation alliance 
came as a surprise to many voters the peacetime ban on nuclear 
weapons has been in effect for three decades and a shaky coalition 
government has been struggling with economic not military issues 
indeed some voters say economic troubles remain the chief issue 
its not just a question about nuclear weapons but about the 
way the government runs society said susane nielsen a 
conservative voter who works in a health insurance office we 
have to face these economic problems 
the unexpected showdown began april 14 when the leftist 
opposition pushed through a parliamentary resolution intended to 
strengthen the countrys ban on peacetime nuclear weapons 
the move which has been delayed pending the election requires 
the government to notify individual warships of the countrys ban 
parliamentary negotiators have not decided if the ships would then 
have to respond 
until now denmark has simply stated its policy to one and all 
some allies reacted sharply to the latest proposal warning it 
jeopardizes denmarks participation in nato a meeting of natos 
nuclear planning group was rescheduled from denmark to belgium 
britain called off naval maneuvers in denmark 
some danes have reacted with resentment to the foreign 
pressures has the danes national pride deteriorated so much 
that we will bow to pressure from abroad the leftleaning 
newspaper information asked in a frontpage editorial 
the question is the central one in the current debate and in 
that sense the election is the most important since world war ii 
of course it did not help matters when reagan administration 
spokesman marlin fitzwater joked to reporters that danish means 
breakfast to me 
national radio played the englishlanguage tape on the air an 
unusual step reagan staff demonstrates its knowledge of 
denmark said a sarcastic headline in the liberal politiken 
newspaper fitzwater later apologized 
the confrontation comes at a politically unstable time for this 
country of 5 million people the last general election in september 
left schlueters centerright coalition in command of just 70 of 
parliaments 179 votes just enough to command a majority on 
economic matters 
polls suggest that danes favor nato membership a recently 
published poll by the observa organization showed that 66 percent 
of danes favor staying in nato and just 16 percent oppose it the 
most lopsided margin in years a gallup poll said danes favor 
membership 59 percent to 16 percent 
another survey published in the boersen business newspaper 
showed that 46 percent of danes believed it was reasonable to ask 
nato ships to guarantee they carry no nuclear arms 36 percent did 
not and 18 percent were undecided the responses crossed political 
lines 
further strains in relations between denmark and its allies 
could carry strategic implications denmarks lowlying peninsula 
and islands command approaches to the baltic sea and nato 
strategists envision it as a key supply point in case of invasion 
from the east 
the dispute follows years of contention over denmarks declining 
defense spending which amounts to 2 percent of its gross national 
product among the lowest in the alliance 
however random interviews with window shoppers along stroeget 
a pedestrian street in copenhagen suggest many people are more 
worried about the countrys weak economy than its military role 
unemployment is running at 97 percent and the national debt 
has reached 43 billion 
joergen thy editor and writer for a computer magazine said he 
planned to vote against the government because i dont think they 
have achieved much 
he calls the nuclear question a joke thats not the 
issue he says 
indeed danish elections have focused mainly on economic issues 
since world war ii

secretary of state george p shultz who has 
sought to improve relations with eastern europe discussed human 
rights and economic issues tuesday with the highestranking 
bulgarian official to visit washington since world war ii 
andrei lukanov minister of foreign economic relations outlined 
bulgarian plans to improve its economy and told shultz his country 
was eager to increase trade with the united states through joint 
ventures a state department official said 
the official speaking on condition of anonymity said the talks 
were cordial relaxed and businesslike 
shultz reminded lukanov of the us concerns about bulgarian 
treatment of its turkish minority the official said the state 
department amnesty international and others have accused bulgaria 
of seeking to force assimilation on 900000 people of turkish 
origin 
under a 1975 law bulgaria and other soviet allies remain 
ineligible for special us tariff reductions most favored nation 
status as long as their emigration policies are deemed by the 
united states to be restrictive 
in practice a nations entire human rights policies are 
scrutinized before a decision is made on most favored nation status 
bulgaria has sought to join poland hungary and romania as 
sovietbloc countries eligible for the benefits but the request 
has been denied the state department official said the issue was 
not raised with lukanov who is the first bulgarian politburo 
member to visit washington since bulgaria became a communist 
country following world war ii 
this was basically an overview of relations rather than a 
detailed discussion of economic issues the official said 
bulgaria traditionally has taken its economic and foreign policy 
cues from the soviet union and its recent moves to improve 
efficiency and add marketplace approaches to the economy have 
mirrored similar efforts by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
like the soviet union bulgaria also has sought to increase the 
amount of high technology it is permitted to buy in the united 
states 
lukanovs visit to the united states will include a trip to the 
northern california region known as silicon valley because of its 
numerous hightech industries and to los angeles chicago and new 
york 
in recent years the reagan administration has sought to improve 
its diplomatic relations with soviet bloc coun the past three years

local officials are scrambling to 
avert a financial crisis as a 230000 payroll comes due friday 
with only 884 in the citys bank account to cover it 
officials of this financially strapped southern illinois city 
laid off 25 city employees on monday and the treasurers office was 
closed for the day in costsaving measures

money to keep the city solvent 
they laid off my administrative assistant and two 
accountants as well as four other workers said ms moore

contract and a monthly 29000 payment on a 34 million lawsuit 
judgment 
disputes over payment for garbage pickup and the recent court

from the budget to keep the municipality from going bankrupt 
to help ms moores office function three workers from other 
departments were transferred into the treasurers office but ms 
moore said she was unhappy with the transfers which replaced 
accountants and account clerks wth clerktypists and reference 
clerks 
ms moore and city clerk alzada carr who lost one of her three 
employees to the layoffs said they were to meet with their 
attorneys to determine whether they can take legal action to 
prevent the gutting of their offices 
ms carr said the loss of her deputy reference clerk one of 
those transferred to the treasurers office kept her from being 
able to fill all the requests for city documents received monday

a federal court jury found today that 
mick jagger did not steal an unknown reggae musicians song and 
turn it into his 1985 hit just another night 
fans in the courtroom broke into applause after the verdict and 
jagger said he planned to celebrate by having a beer with his 
lawyers 
my reputation is really cleared if youre wellknown people 
stand up and take shots at you its one of those things in a 
litigious society jagger told reporters 
the sixperson civil panel had listened to tapes of both 
jaggers song and one written in 1979 by patrick alley 36 which 
is also named just another night 
i still believe and i know thats my song said alley 36 
who had accused jagger of copyright infringement 
shortly before issuing the verdict jurors asked for a rereading 
of the law on access they were apparently trying to determine 
whether jagger could have heard or known about alleys song prior 
to writing his own 
alleys lawyers said jagger made 6 million from the song which 
appeared on an album called shes the boss 
jagger looking weary had testified monday rebutting a 
statement by alleys attorneys that longtime collaborator keith 
richards tended to write the music while jagger handled the lyrics 
jagger was gracious to fans throughout the trial but pushed 
angrily through a mob as he left the courthouse monday night 
crowds waiting to see the rock legend broke a door at the small 
courthouse according to security officials 
two alternate jurors dismissed when the jury began 
deliberations said they also would have found for jagger 
i think he did it independently said barbara carroll of 
pelham who found jagger to be a gentleman hes completely 
different than what i thought from his videos her children 
ranging from 16 to 25 are fans

reagan held a white house ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary 
of the national commission on excellence in educations biting 
critique a nation at risk that spawned efforts in nearly 
every state to raise academic standards and the pay and performance 
of teachers 
reagan said the earlier report commissioned by bennetts 
predecessor th bell helped heighten and acclerate a wave of 
education reform in states and communities all around the country 
he said it led many states to install career ladders and merit 
pay for teachers and many schools placed a new emphasis on 
quality and discipline more homework more attention to basic 
skills 
this was truly revolutionary after two decades in which money 
had been the only measure of progress in education and in which 
while federal spending on education went steadily up test scores 
fell steadily downward too many schools accepted the fashions of 
the day fashions of liberal culture that held traditional 
standards in scorn reagan said 
earlier 350 national education association members rallied in 
lafayette park across from the white house to protest the report 
sen lowell p weicker jr rconn drew applause when he called 
bennett the secretary of ignorance 
nea president mary hatwood futrell said bennetts report was an 
attempt to whitewash the administrations failure to fulfill 
its obligation to help improve schools 
american educatioan can be made to work better and it can be 
made to work better now reagan told the 200 people gathered in 
the east room of the white house 
bell was not invited to the ceremony eight of the 18 members of 
the national commission on excellence in education did attend 
including university of california president david gardner who 
said afterwards of the bennett report it was timely helpful 
tended to be constructive i believe it could have been written in 
a more positive fashion i also think it was short in terms of 
the role the federal government ought to be playing 
bennett said in presenting the report to the president 
american education has made some progress in the last few years 
but we are not doing well enough and we are not doing well 
enough fast enough we are still at risk 
if our schools are to improve the powerful resistance to 
reform must be overcome the nations modest success over the 
past five yers is both proof of reforms possibilities and a 
summons to renewed effort bennett said 
i guarantee you we will seize the opportunity to elect a 
proeducation president of the united states said ms futrell in 
addressing the protesters only then will we have a secretary of 
education more interested in leadership than in showmanship 
the nea was one of the few major education groups not invited to 
the ceremony 
a nation at risk made headlines and laid the groundwork for 
moves in 
i think its an excellent report a good summary of what 
progress has been made and also of what remains to be done bell 
said in a telephone interview from salt lake city 
but bell said he wished the report had given greater emphasis to 
what the federal government should be doing especially on the 
horrendous problem of 40 percent dropout rates for minority 
youths 
albert shanker president of the american federation of 
teachers said if secretary bennett and the president really 
feel that the nation is still at risk they ought to propose 
something that the federal government does to get us out of this 
mess other than just preaching at everyone else 
bennetts report said american education has made some 
undeniable progress in the last few years the precipitous downward 
slide of previous decades has been arrested and we have begun the 
long climb back to reasonable standards 
we are doing better than we were in 1983 but we are certainly 
not doing well enough we are still at risk 
scott d thomson executive director of the national association 
of secondary school principals said 
he doesnt recognize that weve made these gains at the same 
time weve admitted over 2 million nonenglish speaking immigrant 
students to the school population and in the face of growing 
numbers of poor families 
he doesnt recognize the fact that were fending off the drug 
pushers with one hand from the community and trying to teach them 
with the other

strong spending by american consumers helped 
the economy grow at a healthy 23 percent annual rate during the 
first three months of 1988 the government said tuesday dispelling 
fear of any lingering ill effects from the october stock market 
crash 
the commerce department in its first look at overall economic 
peformance this year said consumer spending the biggest surge in 
business investment in more than four years and growing exports 
kept the gross national product rising despite declines in 
government spending and housing construction 
so much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the 
first quarter said commerce undersecretary robert ortner 
whatever the impact of the crash was its pretty much behind 
us 
i think these are uncommonly good gnp numbers said jerry 
jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers 
early this year economists had feared the evaporation of 500 
billion in wealth during the oct 19 stock market crash would scare 
consumers whose spending represents twothirds of the economy and 
cause a drastic slowdown or even a recession 
but as signs of strength accumulated through the quarter most 
analysts began expecting moderate growth about in line with what 
was reported tuesday interest rates on bonds which likely would 
have risen on news of strongerthanexpected growth showed little 
reaction to the gnp report 
the economy had expanded at a much faster 48 percent rate in 
the octoberdecember quarter but most of the increased production 
went into inventories and consumer spending actually dropped 
that combination often presages a recession manufacturers 
faced with a backlog of unsold goods cut production and lay off 
workers 
however consumer spending rebounded by 236 billion in the 
first quarter a 38 percent annual rate of increase with more 
than half of that growth coming in auto sales 
in turn business inventories which had risen by 394 billion 
in the fourth quarter fell by 132 billion in the first quarter 
ortner said automakers are now well positioned to increase 
production adding 1 percent or more to second quarter gnp 
business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual 
rate of 325 percent in the first quarter the fastest advance 
since a 395 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1983 much 
of the strength there came in computers 
beryl sprinkel the presidents chief economic adviser told a 
white house briefing that the big boost in capital spending should 
help ease inflationary pressures 
as manufacturers in industries running at almost full capacity 
expand their factories production bottlenecks and resulting price 
increases gradually will become less likely he said 
the rate of inflation as measured by the gnp rose at an annual 
rate of 24 percent in the januarymarch quarter down from a 27 
increase in the fourth quarter 
the economy is on track for moderate further expansion and for 
restrained inflation in 1988 sprinkel said 
in other good news the countrys trade deficit after removing 
the effects of inflation narrowed by 36 billion in the first 
quarter continuing the trend of improvement that began in mid1986 
however allen sinai chief economist of the boston co said an 
increase in imports although slower rate than the rise in exports 
was troubling exports rose 102 percent in the quarter while 
imports rose 52 percent 
the problem with trade remains too many imports americans are 
not yet buying american sinai said 
the administration which is looking for a sixth straight year 
of economic growth to boost chances for a republican presidential 
win in november has forecast that gnp will grow 29 percent for 
the full year 
the administration is counting on further improvements in the 
trade deficit to supply almost half of the growth much of the rest 
is expected to come from higher business capital spending as 
companies expand to meet a growing export demand 
in another report the government said that aftertax corporate 
profits rose an even faster 26 percent in the final three months 
of 1987 this was an upward revision from a month ago when the 
government put the increase in business profits at 16 percent 
two factors that held back gnp growth in the first quarter were 
a 94 percent drop in residential construction spending and a 223 
percent drop in spending by the federal government reflecting in 
large part a swing in farm subsidy payments 
the various changes pushed the gnp after adjusting for 
inflation up by 218 billion to a new annual rate of 390 
trillion

the reagan administration urged the supreme 
court on tuesday to scrap a federal law used to prosecute several 
former white house aides and to investigate attorney general edwin 
meese iii 
the law gives too much power to people totally untethered to 
any politically responsible person argued solicitor general 
charles fried the justice departments top courtroom lawyer 
disputed provisions in the ethics in government act of 1978 
allow independent counsels formerly called special prosecutors to 
investigate alleged misconduct by key executivebranch officials 
fried said such investigations should be conducted only by 
officials answerable to the president 
independent counsel alexia morrison defending the law said 
congress wanted to preclude the appearance or the reality of a 
conflict of interest arising from an administration investigating 
itself 
the high courts decision expected by july could help define 
the nations political life in future years 
the decision also could affect the criminal convictions of 
former white house aides michael k deaver and lyn nofziger and the 
irancontra affair prosecutions of exwhite house aides john m 
poindexter and oliver north 
ms morrison is investigating allegations that theodore b 
olson a former assistant attorney general lied to congress in 
1983 during a dispute over the environmental protection agencys 
cleanup program for toxic waste sites 
a federal appeals court ruled the independent counsel law is an 
unconstitutional encroachment on the presidents power to enforce 
criminal laws 
fried urged the justices to uphold the appeals court ruling 
saying the law strips the president of a purely executive 
function criminal prosecution 
he said the law also wrongly absolves congress of its 
weightiest and most painful duty serving as a watchdog for 
abuses of executive power fried said the proper remedy for such 
misconduct is impeachment by congress 
olsons lawyer thomas s martin added that the law radically 
alters the structure of how we are governed 
joining ms morrison in defending the law during a 90minute 
argument session was michael davidson the senates chief lawyer 
davidson fielded questions from several justices who voiced 
concern about the laws empowering a special court rather than the 
president or his subordinates to appoint special prosecutors he 
said such appointment power is a minor aspect of the law 
chief justice william h rehnquist seemed less than convinced 
you cannot assign to one branch certain functions that inherently 
belong to the other he said 
but rehnquist also asked martin olsons lawyer why the 
specialprosecutor provision was dissimilar from congress routinely 
placing limits on a presidents power to remove one of his 
executivebranch appointees 
justice thurgood marshall asked martin shouldnt a prosecutor 
be independent whats wrong with it 
the case is being decided by eight justices because justice 
anthony m kennedy has disqualified himself for unexplained reasons 
his absence creates the possibility of a 44 tie which would 
have the effect of automatically upholding the appeals court 
decision invalidating the law 
asked by reporters whether that possibility concerned her ms 
morrison would not comment saying only i will anxiously await 
the courts ruling 
martin said he did not expect an evenly divided court i think 
a consensus will emerge and i dont expect a 44 split he said 
deaver was convicted of perjury earlier this year for lying to a 
grand jury and a house subcommittee that investigated his lobbying 
activities 
poindexter north and two others were indicted in special 
prosecutor lawrence walshs investigation of the irancontra affair 
independent counsel james c mckay who successfully prosecuted 
nofziger for illegal lobbying also is investigating meese in 
connection with possible financial conflicts of interest

an emergency water rationing plan under 
consideration in the city would close down decorative public 
fountains and prohibit restaurants from giving water to customers 
unless they ask for it 
the second phase of the proposal by the citys water department 
would require each resident and business to pay a higher rate for 
less water by the end of may 
the conservation plan which will be considered thursday by the 
public utilities commission would begin sunday it would allow 
each home or business a water allocation based on a 25 percent 
reduction of the amount of water it used in 1987 
washing down sidewalks or patios with drinking water would be 
prohibited under the plan fountains including those in civic 
center united nations plaza and the villiancourt fountain near the 
ferry building would be shut off 
washing a car with a hose would be prohibited unless the hose 
has a shutoff valve 
the increase which has not yet been determined would accompany 
penalties for using more water than the allocation the city will 
also consider placing flow restrictors on water lines in homes or 
businesses that do not cut use 
water rationing is necessary because of two dry years in a row 
water officials said last weeks rains did little to increase 
runoff from melting snow in the tuolumne river watershed where the 
san francisco area gets most of its drinking water runoff was 34 
percent of normal as of monday officials said 
san francisco would be the second water system in the area to 
impose rationing the east bay municipal utility district last week 
adopted a flat daily allocation of 400 gallons for its 11 million 
customers

a company used a videotaped appeal from 
famed test pilot chuck yeager and the promise that profits from its 
sales would fund a veterans park to lure investors into losing 
800000 in a fake medallion scam prosecutors said 
the 37count federal indictment issued last week and unsealed 
monday names seven individuals and two companies canam mint and 
trading ltd which had offices in bloomington and eden prairie 
and vets for vets inc which was incorporated in south dakota but 
shared offices with canam 
many of these victims are very elderly people and a number 
have lost members of their families in vietnam said assistant 
us attorney joan ericksen they are an extremely vulnerable 
group of victims 
among the victims one elderly north dakota man sent in 81000 
and received nothing in return ericksen said in all she said 
about 45 investors from as far away as california north carolina 
and texas were involved 
the indictment alleges that since march 1986 the defendants 
tried to induce veterans and other investors to buy 3ounce silver 
commemorative medallions for 99 each and promised that the 
medallions would increase in value by 12 percent in a year only a 
few of the investors received the medallions ericksen said 
the investors were assured that half the profits would be used 
by vets for vets to fund a veterans park near mount rushmore in 
south dakotas black hills according to the indictment 
the defendants allegedly told investors that 70 acres had been 
donated for the park and that groundbreaking would take place on 
memorial day 1987 according to the indictment the government 
claims that no land was donated or bought for the park and no park 
had been built 
yeager a retired air force general and the first pilot to break 
the sound barrier withdrew from the project after a short time 
ericksen said 
it sounds like a really good idea she said you sell 
these medallions build a park in south dakota honor these 
veterans i can see why his agent would be interested in this 
obviously shortly after he got involved with these folks he 
figured out what was up and he withdrew his support she said he 
got involved because he was simply lied to she said 
a woman answering the telephone in yeagers office in grass 
valley calif said he was out of town and not available for 
comment 
a telephone call to the canam mint and trading ltd office was 
answered by a recording saying the number had been temporarily 
disconnected at the customers request a call placed to the number 
given for vets for vets did not go through 
it looked legitimate said pete ellingson of inver grove 
heights who said he agreed to buy 10 medallions at more than 80 
each after doing some videotape editing and duplicating for one of 
the defendants companies 
their offices had the fanciest of furniture the biggest of 
layouts he said they kept calling me back and saying pete 
youre going to miss the market these things are really 
soaring 
charged with numerous mail fraud counts are michael j crosby 
39 who is in custody in california on unrelated fraud charges 
james a sannes 43 of st paul jack p cunningham 52 of 
burnsville tamara m kesler 24 of burnsville dale v peterson 
39 of stacy martin l cheatham 40 formerly of st paul and 
phillip p krzyzaniak of irvine calif 
the indictment says crosby was the president of canam kesler 
was the companys director of administration and sannes was 
president of vets for vets 
kesler cunningham and peterson appeared last friday before a 
federal magistrate and were freed after each posting 5 percent of 
50000 bail ericksen said she will ask that crosby be transferred 
from california to minnesota 
the three remaining defendants were not in custody as of monday 
according to federal officials

a convoy of usflagged kuwaiti tankers 
moved into the persian gulf on tuesday for the first time since 
last weeks clash with iran but the vessels turned back 
reportedly because of bad weather 
one source an official close to the kuwait oil tanker co which 
owns the tankers said another attempt to move the ships might come 
within 24 hours 
shipping executives said a sandstorm reduced visibility in the 
central gulf to less than two miles thereby limiting the ability 
of minehunting helicopters and navy vessels to detect mines 
they said that although two mine danger areas had been 
cleared by american and other mine sweepers in recent days there 
still was too much risk in sending ships into the area without 
adequate minehunting protection 
a spokesman for the us central command said he could provide 
no information on any convoy activity the united states 
customarily does not confirm the movements until they have passed 
specific danger points in the gulf 
us officials speaking privately earlier had conceded there 
was growing concern over the freeze in convoy movements that 
followed the mining of a us navy frigate and the subsequent 
usiran skirmishes 
the 3700ton guided missile frigate samuel b roberts ran into 
a mine on april 14 ten crewmen were injured in the blast 
the united states retaliated four days later with a series of 
attacks on iranian targets in the gulf during the day the us 
navy sank or damaged six iranian naval craft 
after the roberts incident more than a dozen mines were found 
and destroyed by us british dutch belgian and italian mine 
hunters in that area french warships destroyed mines in another 
area 70 miles away 
us officials said they still were trying to identify the type 
of missiles fired at the us warships during the april 18 battles 
officers aboard the ships identified them as chinesemade 
silkworms but military officials in washington said that had not 
been confirmed 
british and french convoys were reported to have passed through 
the mine danger area but the source close to the kuwaiti oil 
firm said the kuwaiti convoys would not move until us and kuwaiti 
officials were satisfied that the mine and missile threat was under 
control 
the 11 kuwaiti tankers reflagged by the united states last year 
for protection from iranian attack operate on a fairly tight 
schedule in delivering petroleum cargoes to kuwaits longterm 
contract customers mainly in japan and europe 
a twotanker convoy that had been scheduled to enter the gulf 
april 15 was canceled and four more ships arrived within days at 
the convoy staging area off the united arab emirates port of khor 
fakkan 
one us offcer called it an unprecedented traffic jam 
us officials in washington had denied last week that the 
escort operations had been suspended 
the ships at khor fakkan included the 401283ton supertanker 
bridgeton which had been slated to make one of its infrequent 
trips into the gulf since it was hit by a mine on the first convoy 
last july 24 
the others were the 46723ton gas queen scheduled to move with 
the bridgeton and the oil products carriers townsend 294739 
tons the 81283ton sea isle city and the chesapeake city and 
ocean city both 79999 tons 
a seventh tanker the 46723ton liquefied gas carrier gas king 
was stranded at kuwait awaiting clearance to sail south

the major producing states by april 24 ahead of the 11 percent 
pace of a year ago and the longterm average progress of 9 percent 
by this time

pay raises are continuing to grow rather than 
diminish for the first time this decade with benefit increases 
doubling in size overall in the past year and tripling for 
bluecollar workers the government said tuesday 
wage and benefit increases for the 12 months ending in march 
averaged 41 percent compared with 34 percent during the previous 
12 months the labor department said 
overtheyear gains of 35 percent in basic wage rates for 
nonunion workers in private industry exceeded those of union 
members at 26 percent continuing a trend that has dominated most 
of the decade the department said 
but when benefits are included that gap narrowed considerably 
a 4 percent total compensation gain for nonunion workers versus 
39 percent for those who belong to unions 
and in the rebounding manufacturing sector union members with 
combined wage and benefit gains averaging 55 percent outpaced 
nonunion workers with an average increase of 42 percent the 
bureau of labor statistics said 
the government data reflects what analysts and labor negotiators 
for both businesses and unions have been seeing as a growing demand 
for more untaxed benefits rather than taxable wage increases 
despite nominally lower tax rates 
just last month officials of the teamsters union were told by 
180000 members to take back a contract just negotiated with the 
trucking industry and swap some of the pay increase for bigger 
employer contributions to health and pension plans 
benefit increases in the past 12 months have averaged 58 
percent overall in private industry double the 29 percent rate 
during the previous 12 months the labor departments statisticians 
said tuesday 
and among bluecollar workers benefit cost increases to 
employers have nearly tripled from a 23 percent gain a year ago 
to 68 percent that past 12 months in manufacturing the average 
benefit increase the past 12 months was 7 percent compared with 
just 15 percent a year ealier 
the government said the bulk of the accelerating benefit 
increase is represented by escalating health insurance costs with a 
smaller portion coming from increased social security contributions 
by employers 
some of these benefits have turned into entitlements and just 
like the government a lot of businesses have lost control of 
them said richard belous an labor economist for the conference 
board a business research group 
for a while it looked like many employers were containing 
health care costs but in the last year a lot of the solutions such 
as increased outpatient care and requiring second opinions before 
surgery have unraveled he said with mandatory health 
insurance on the horizon a lot of companies are going to have to 
go back to the drawing board 
however john zalusky an economist for the aflcio said much 
of the difference in the benefit increases between union and 
nonunion workers can be explained by the stock market crash last 
october 
union employers tend to have defined benefit pension plans 
which means that when the market crashed they had to put more 
money into the kitty he said nonunion employers have 
switched more to defined contribution plans in which the 
beneficiaries absorbed the brunt of the crash 
zalusky agreed that unions are emphasizing nonpay items more at 
the bargaining table such as profitsharing bonus and employee 
stock ownership plans that dont show up in the governments 
collective bargaining or employment cost figures 
the worker retraining programs negotiated with ford general 
motors and atampt now constitute the largest privately endowed 
education program in the country he said and they are nowhere 
reflected in the data 
in a separate report the labor department said firstyear pay 
increases in major union contracts negotiated the first three 
months of 1988 averaged only 21 percent excluding costofliving 
adjustments cola and lumpsum bonuses 
however excluding the 20 percent who agreed to wage freezes 
often in exchange for profitsharing stock ownership or bonus 
arrangements the average increase under the new contracts was 27 
percent the department said 
including the cola payments and lumpsum or profitsharing 
bonuses from other older contracts the average effective wage 
increase over the past 12 months under collective bargaining 
agreements has been 38 percent the government said 
that compares favorably with both the 24 percent effective wage 
increase a year earlier for union members and the 35 percent gain 
the past 12 months for nonunion workers 
earlier government data showed that union workers last year 
maintained a roughly 36 percent wage advantage over nonunion 
workers 465 a week vs 342 in 1987

a collection of the personal scrapbooks tape 
recordings published and unpublished sheet music of edward kennedy 
duke ellington was presented to the smithsonian institution on 
tuesday by the son of the late composerorchestra leader 
weve come to perpetuate ellington as a composer mercer 
ellington said personally it gives me the satisfaction of 
knowing we have located ellington in a place of posterity 
we will come to see him take his place among the other great 
composers of note such as debussy ellington said there is 
also the fact that a black american was able to achieve this 
without having to go anyplace else he got it at home 
acquisition of the 6000item collection followed three years of 
negotiations with the ellington estate and a special congressional 
appropriation of 500000 said roger g kennedy director of the 
smithsonians national museum of american history the collection 
will be housed in the jazz section of the museums division of 
musical history 
he said about half the funds would be used to preserve the older 
manuscripts some still stored in brown cardboard boxes 
the smithsonian also plans to sponser performances of 
ellingtons previously unknown works and issue an unspecified 
number of publications featuring articles from the collection 
we have produced many good songwriters in this country said 
martin williams cultural historian of the smithsonian institution 
press but he was much more than that he was a 
composerorchestrator 
it is on those accomplishments that he receives the respect 
that he has as a major figure in 20th century music williams 
said 
the author of several smithsonian jazz books williams said the 
collection offers ellingtonologists the opportunity to examine 
the original sheet music of the dukes classics including satin 
doll mood indigo and caravan all other sheet music of 
ellingtons works had been transcribed from old recordings and 
tapes he said 
to pop the best song was the one he was writing at the time 
ellington said noting that his father had written some rock n 
roll songs from his rhythm and blues times 
ellington also told of the time when his father put together a 
bebop group called the spacemen he never excluded himself from 
any generation

plo leader yasser arafat left syria on 
tuesday after agreeing with president hafez assad to work for a 
strategic alliance against israel and a us middle east peace plan 
arafat met with assad on monday to try to end a fiveyear feud 
between two of the arab worlds most influential figures 
farouk kaddoumi head of the palestine liberation organizations 
political department said arafat would return to damascus soon 
after the foundations for a common action had been laid in the 
3hourt meeting with assad 
kaddoumi also said that a summit meeting grouping assad arafat 
algerian president chadli bendjedid and libyan leader col moammar 
gadhafi probably would be held next month in either the libyan or 
algerian capital 
arafat also met for one hour tuesday with vice president 
abdulhalim khaddam before leaving for libya aboard a special 
plane he later told reporters his talks in damascus were useful 
and will have positive results on the palestinian and arab levels 
arafat arrived in syria on sunday and visited the grave of 
khalil wazir arafats deputy who was gunned down april 16 
the plo chief was accompanied on tuesdays flight to libya by 
salah khalaf better known as abu iyad his no 2 man in fatah the 
plos mainstream faction and arafats power base 
arafat left kaddoumi and other aides behind to work out the 
details of a new syrianplo alliance 
in an interview after arafats departure kaddoumi said syria 
and the plo have agreed to work together in a joint struggle 
against israel and us middle east peace plans 
that was a reference to a peace plan presented by us secretary 
of state george p shultz last march under the peace plan 
palestinians in the west bank and gaza strip would be granted 
limited selfrule 
palestinians in those territories have been rioting against the 
israeli occupation since dec 8 
both syria and the plo rejected the plan and insist on settling 
the middle east problem through an international peace conference 
that would lead to the creation of a palestinian state 
kaddoumi said there was complete harmony in the stands of 
the plo and syria on this issue 
he said the uprising in the occupied west bank is our syrian 
and plo first concern we agree that all our efforts should focus 
on bolstering the uprising and rallying support for it 
kaddoumi the plos chief diplomat said syria and the plo have 
worked out details of their new alliance before an extraordinary 
arab summit meeting tentatively set for early june in algiers 
he said both leaders hope they will go to the summit with 
identical views on all issues if not a common working paper 
rafik alnatsheh another fatah central committee member who 
attended the talks in damascus said syria and the plo had solved 
most of their problems

your bank cash machine has gone berserk giving 
out 20 bills as if they were fivers yet your receipt shows no 
sign of overpayment 
do you 
a use the emergency telephone to alert the bank 
b take the money and run 
c call your friends to get down there too 
if you chose the first option you are a rare breed of cat 
judging from an unintentional ethics experiment staged sunday at a 
manhattan bank branch 
because some hapless employee loaded a canister of 20 bills 
into the slot for 5 bills the first federal savings and loan 
association of rochesters branch at first avenue and 14th street 
launched an accidental exercise in income redistribution 
although the cash machine panel has a 24hour telephone for 
reporting problems outside bank hours the response was not 
overwhelming one or two calls according to bank spokesman 
robert nolan 
instead a line of eager card holders quickly formed at the 
machine 
i called everybody i knew a writer who asked not to be 
identified for fear of prosecution told new york newsday 
an actor named chris who asked for 40 and received 160 was 
amused by the range of reactions one person let out a holler of 
joy another barely raised his eyebrows and sneaked out one woman 
went into a tirade about how shes getting back at the bank for 
money it owed her 
nor did guilt apparently set in later the bank received only 
one call on monday reporting sundays malfunction i was really 
surprised the gentleman called admitted amelia saavedra the 
branch manager 
the most a customer could ask for was 200 and get 800 nolan 
said that although the banks audit was not finished it appeared 
the automated teller overpaid a total somewhat less than 5000 
nolan said the bank was not dismayed by its customers eagerness 
to profit from the foulup i wouldnt want to characterize them 
all he said of the customers i think some individuals were 
innocent recipients of the machine 
he said first federal would learn the identities of those who 
reaped windfalls once it determined how much was lost and who was 
making withdrawals during the time the machine was in the giving 
mood 
well be able to determine who requested what and what they 
really got nolan said adding that customer accounts would be 
automatically charged for the amount overpaid 
the manhattan district attorneys office said bank customers 
might be subject to prosecution for larceny but it was unclear 
whether the bank would be able to prove that all the bills in the 
5 slot were really 20s 
bank cash machines in the city typically hold about 100000 
according to banking industry experts overpayments like sundays 
are said to be extremely rare 
its much more common for the reverse to happen a customer 
is shortchanged said john love of bank network news an industry 
newsletter but we estimate these kinds of problems only occur in 
about onetwentieth of 1 percent of all automated teller 
transactions

a soviet delegation that came to mobile 
seeking a sistercity bond departed in frustration tuesday after 
their weeklong visit to the port city turned diplomatically chilly 
jay higginbotham who spearheaded the sistercity proposal after 
a trip to the soviet union last year said the soviet mayor and two 
city council members from rostovondon were hurt and 
distraught by their rejection 
but the visitors enjoyed their tour of the gulf coast said 
higginbotham a librarian and archivist for the city who has 
written a book on his travels in the soviet union titled fast 
train russia 
mobile mayor arthur outlaw said at the outset he disapproved of 
the proposed sistercity agreement and the proposal never received 
a city council vote thus the proposal died without official 
consideration tuesday 
i dont see what can be gained by relations between an 
appointed government and an elected government that responds to the 
will of the people outlaw said while attending a welcome 
reception for the group last week 
the visitors included alexander balashov mikhail tupchenko 
gennadi zorenko and translator svetlana khokhlova 
in washington quentin crommelin jr the chief republican 
counsel of the us senate foreign relations committee said 
members of the rostov group were likely soviet agents 
it is well known to be standard operating procedure for all 
soviet delegations of whatever type to have at least onethird 
kgb or gru agents as members both to prevent defection and to 
gather intelligence crommelin told the mobile register 
he also suggested that the sistercity link could be proposed to 
gather military intelligence on the proposed navy base at mobile 
and nearby ingalls shipyard at pascagoula miss 
that sounds absurd higginbotham said tuesday 
higgenbotham was a member of a group of residents from mobile 
that visited the soviet city last year and arranged for the 
exchange he said the rostov officials came over trying to make a 
good impression 
higginbotham said gov guy hunt had declared the visitors 
honorary citizens of alabama but he said they left thinking 
something they had said or wore provoked the rejection by mobile 
officials 
it was a little pitiful higginbotham said

an upbeat john demjanjuk met with his family 
for two hours tuesday and was optimistic that his conviction and 
death sentence on nazi war crimes would be overturned relatives 
said 
but an official at the prison where he is being held said guards 
were ordered to put the retired ohio autoworker under suicide 
surveillance 
demjanjuk 68 was returned to solitary confinement in the 
maximumsecurity ayalon prison on monday after being sentenced to 
death for executing hundreds of thousands of jews as the brutal 
nazi guard ivan the terrible 
demjanjuk who insisted he was innocent throughout the 14month 
trial plans to appeal to israels supreme court 
israel prison service spokesman johnny tester said demjanjuk was 
placed under 24hour guard and we are asking his guards to be 
more careful more alert we want to be prepared in case of a 
suicide attempt 
demjanjuks son john demjanjuk jr said the precautions were 
a bunch of baloney 
theyre going to pop up with that kind of stupid propaganda to 
try to make it seem like he might kill himself out of remorse or 
guilt john demjanjuk jr 22 told the associated press 
my father would never attempt something like that because hes 
innocent and hell fight this to the last minute the younger 
demjanjuk said 
demjanjuks daughter lydia maday 38 said her father was 
cheerful tuesday during the familys first meeting since he was 
sentenced to die 
we definitely get our strength from him you keep thinking 
when you go in there youre going to have to pump him up and its 
just the opposite mrs maday said hes prepared to move on 
and get ready for the appeal 
she said demjanjuk who was extradited to israel from his 
suburban cleveland home told the family he bore no animosity 
toward the israeli judges or the 650 spectators who clapped and 
chanted death death when the sentence was announced 
hes not vindictive theres no hate mrs maday said he 
just said its a shame that people have to rejoice in someone 
elses sorrow you just have to overlook it a lot of people didnt 
feel that way 
mrs maday said demjanjuk a devout ukrainian orthodox 
christian cited passages from the bible and said christ was spat 
upon and villified and yet he turned the other cheek my dad says 
hes another innocent victim and he can take it too 
john demjanjuk jr said the defense would not file an appeal for 
several weeks until after the family returns home to map a 
strategy 
demjanjuk was convicted april 18 of being the sadistic guard who 
helped operate the gas chambers at the treblinka death camp in 
nazioccupied poland where 850000 jews were killed 
prime minister yitzhak shamir who lost relatives in the 
holocaust praised the sentence 
all of us are proud that a jewish tribunal in the jewish state 
has judged and condemned one of the cruelest war criminals who 
murdered many of our jewish brethren and relatives the 
polishborn shamir said 
some israelis saw the 14month trial as a crucial opportunity to 
educate the younger generation and remind the world of the horrors 
of the holocaust 
the personal fate of john demjanjuk isnt important or very 
interesting yosef lapid an israeli commentator and holocaust 
survivor said on israel radio the importance of the trial was 
to remind us of the holocaust for most of humanity the holocaust 
is cloudy history

jesse jackson seeking to spotlight southern 
africa in the presidential campaign went to the state department 
tuesday to discuss mozambican rebel atrocities and to say south 
africa should be treated as a terrorist state 
jackson pointed to a new report by a state department consultant 
that said the rebels in mozambique have killed 100000 civilians 
and engaged in systematic murder beating mutilation rape 
looting burnings and abductions 
the democratic presidential contender said south african support 
for the rebels amounts to statesponsored terrorism and the 
united states should provide security to south africas neighbors

secretary of state john whitehead for a briefing on the report 
which was compiled by a department consultant robert gersony 
chester crocker assistant secretary of state for african 
affairs joined jackson at a news conference afterward 
crocker said there is a pattern of continuing contact between 
south africa and renamo the rebel group and he said south 
africas involvement goes against a 1984 treaty it entered with 
mozambique 
south africa denies having supported the rebels since that time 
jackson used the gersony report to underscore his call for a 
change in us policy toward south africa and the frontline 
states around it 
he called on democratic rival michael dukakis and republican 
george bush to join him in calling south africa a terrorist state 
jackson said congress should pass legislation clarifying its 
meaning of statesponsored terrorism to specifically include south 
africa 
he also called for an increase in humanitarian aid to the 
frontline states and for a congressional delegation to visit 
mozambique on a factfinding mission 
jackson has repeatedly tried to make south africa and the 
frontline states a campaign issue but other candidates have not 
focused on it he met tuesday morning with some members of congress 
and frontline states ambassadors to discuss the issue 
some conservative members of congress have called for us aid 
to renamo which is trying to bring down mozambiques marxistled

grapefruit on sale in italy after some pieces of fruit believed 
imported from israel were found laced with a powerful poison 
the health ministry ordered the nationwide seizure of all 
grapefruit on sale and and in warehouses after health officials in 
the lazio region which includes rome reported that poisoned 
grapefruit was found in a rome supermarket 
italian news media said the grapefruit apparently was imported 
from israel but officials said they could not immediately confirm 
where the fruit originated 
last week an organization that said it supported the 
palestinian uprising in the israelioccupied west bank and gaza 
strip claimed to have poisoned israeli grapefruit on sale in milan 
it called for a boycott of israeli products 
laboratory checks at the time found no trace of poison 
the claim was made by a caller to a rome newspaper who said he 
was speaking on behalf of the organization of metropolitan 
proletarians and oppressed people a group that was not known to 
have existed 
of the 12 grapefruit on sale at the rome supermarket six were 
found to have been injected by syringe with a bluish poison the 
substance which was not identified was so powerful that it killed 
laboratory mice instantly 
the university of romes poison center reported receiving calls 
from three rome residents who said they had eaten grapefruit with 
blue marks on monday or tuesday 
so far none of them has reported any ill effects said 
professor enrico malizia head of the department 
israeligrown jaffa grapefruit in cellophane wrappers is 
sold widely in italy 
israeli embassy spokesman avi granot promised to cooperate with 
italian authorities to determine whether the grapefruit poisoning 
was an isolated case a gesture of a madman or a terrorist act 
it is certainly a criminal act he said 
granot said an expert from israels agriculture ministry was on 
his way to rome to help in the investigations 
the italian news agency ansa said there was at least one 
precedent for the poisoning it reported that oranges and 
grapefruits from israel were poisoned with mercury in several 
western european nations in 1978 there was no claim of 
responsibility 
the news agency reported that italy imports about 23000 tons of 
grapefruit from israel annually

grapefruit in 1987 grapefruit imports from israel were valued at 
an estimated 132 million 
owners of the rome supermarket where the poisoned grapefruit was 
found said they had sold about 36 jaffa grapefruit the day before 
the contaminated ones were taken for testing on april 20 
supermarket clients said two or three youths were distributing 
pamphlets near the store last week urging customers to boycott 
israeli goods ansa reported they said a poster affixed on a wall 
outside the supermarket said dont buy jaffa grapefruit boycott

nato defense ministers open a twoday 
conference wednesday to keep their policies in line with superpower 
efforts to cut nuclear weapons 
the meeting comes amid internal strains between much of the 
western military alliance and denmark which has moved to 
strengthen its longstanding ban on peacetime nuclear weapons this 
weeks talks were originally supposed to take place in denmark but 
they were moved to nato headquarters in brussels in reaction to the 
danish initiative 
in addition the ministers will grapple with west german fears 
about natos plan to modernize shortrange nuclear arms the 
germans think such a move could make them a more likely target for 
soviet aggression 
however this weeks nato meeting is not likely to yield major 
decisions alliance officials say it is instead intended to review 
longrange nuclear arms planning 
it will be the first defense ministers session since the dec 8 
signing of the ussoviet accord to eliminate two classes of 
groundlaunched medium and shorterrange nuclear missiles the 
us senate is reviewing the treaty 
us defense secretary frank c carlucci was expected to brief 
ministers at the meeting on preparations in the united states and 
the soviet union for an elaborate 13year inspection system to 
check compliance with the treaty 
however ministers will likely discuss the whole range of arms 
control negotiations said a nato official who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
that would include reviewing superpower efforts to sign another 
accord to cut their strategic nuclear arms by 50 percent or 6000 
on each side hopes have faded of completing such a treaty by may 
29 when president reagan meets mikhail gorbachev in moscow 
the defense ministers will review their longterm nuclear arms 
planning in light of the goals nato has set for itself in recent 
years said allied officials 
nato has 4600 nuclear warheads in europe down 2400 since 
1983 the stockpile is at its lowest in 20 years said one nato 
official 
the alliance is studying adjustments to its nuclear deterrent 
through modernization and redeployment of arms without raising the 
total number of warheads the studies deal with developing a new 
shortrange lance groundtoground missile a battlefield 
airtoground missile and improved nuclear artillery shells 
the issue of modernizing shortrange nuclear arms most of which 
are based in west germany has also caused internal nato friction 
bonn fears that as mediumrange missiles disappear under the 
intermediaterange treaty improved shortrange arms would make its 
soil a greater target for soviet attack 
it prefers shortrange nuclear arms talks in tandem with 
conventional talks due to start in vienna this fall but its 
allies say the shortrange arms must still be modernized by the 
mid1990s 
ministers will also probably discuss denmarks proposal to 
notify individual warships of its longstanding ban on nuclear 
weapons 
nato ministers have warned that such a move could threaten 
danish participation in the alliance 
the danes will vote on a new parliament may 10 in what prime 
minister poul schlueter has called a referendum on nato

gov rose mofford who gained office after 
former gov evan mecham was accused of misdeeds that included 
failure to disclose a campaign loan has acknowledged that she did 
not report some land loans and partnerships of her own 
i still question whether the law requires that these items be 
disclosed said mrs mofford who as secretary of state for 10 
years was charged with accepting state officials financial 
disclosure statements 
but i wish to avoid even the appearance of impropriety she 
said promising to file amended statements arizona has been 
through enough without additional doubts and nitpicking 
mrs mofford a democrat was elevated to the governors office 
from secretary of state april 4 after the senate convicted mecham 
a republican on two impeachment counts the senate did not vote on 
a charge that he failed to disclose a 350000 campaign loan an 
issue on which he is to stand trial may 19 
attorney general bob corbin has said he believes such items as 
land loans and partnerships are reportable and an aide said mrs 
moffords filings would be reviewed by his office 
mecham said that if mrs mofford is allowed to get off the hook 
by amending her statements he should be treated the same way 
mecham laughed monday and said i love it when he heard mrs 
moffords statement about doubts and nitpickings 
lawmakers said they would prefer to leave matters in the 
attorney generals hands for now but some left open the 
possibility of another legislative investigation like the one that 
led to mechams impeachment 
well just have to wait until the ag says house speaker 
joe lane who initiated the mecham investigation in the house said 
monday i just hope she gets everything fixed up 
the existence of the land holdings loans and partnerships was 
discovered by the associated press through interviews and records 
in the maricopa county recorders office the state corporation 
commission and the secretary of states partnerships office 
mrs mofford who divorced her husband tr mofford in 1967 but 
remained on good terms with him until his death in 1982 said she 
undertook most of the ventures on behalf of him or his estate and 
therefore felt no need to report them others were of such a minor 
nature that she felt they did not need to be reported either she 
said 
im not trying to hide anything everythings on my income 
taxes she said adding that the ventures on her former husbands 
behalf did not result in any financial profit to herself 
mrs mofford said she would ask corbin to determine if the items 
should have been included on her disclosure forms so that his 
advice can be available to her and to other public officials faced 
with questions her office said monday in a written statement 
corbin was out of town tuesday but chief assistant attorney 
general steve twist had said monday that corbins office planned to 
review records of the transactions 
under the circumstances now it would not be appropriate or us 
to give any personal advice to the governor twist added 
state law requires officeholders to list any source of 
compensation totaling more than 1000 in a single year and any 
title to or beneficial interest in arizona real estate other than 
the officeholders primary residence or primarily recreational 
property 
it also requires disclosure of any business partnership or 
joint venture in which the officeholder is involved and debt of 
more than 1000 owed by or to the officeholder and any gift above 
500 
it is a misdemeanor to file an incomplete or false financial 
disclosure statement and a felony to swear intentionally to a false 
statement 
the statements are filed with the secretary of states office 
two instances mrs mofford has not listed in any of her yearly 
reports involved land acquisition in 1978 in one the moffords and 
robert foudy bought a onethird interest each in land from beryl 
merritt the land was sold about 18 months later and the moffords 
and foudy held a 25000 note 
tr mofford and foudy had died by the time the buyers fell 
behind in payments and in 1986 mrs mofford and foudys son 
michael filed suit an outofcourt settlement paid them more than 
21000 in a lump sum michael foudy said in an interview 
in the other 1978 transaction the moffords and foudy acquired 
individual interests in land from pablo and guadalupe aguilar 
mofford turned his share over to mrs mofford and foudy turned his 
share over to his son 
records also indicate that n50 percent 
participation with him in a 20000 loan in 1983 and her 26plus 
percent paticipation with him and others in a 45000 loan in 1984 
also unreported was mrs moffords participation as a limited 
partner in tempemotorola properties and west broadway properties 
in addition the size of other land and partnership holdings is 
underreported and there are apparent discrepancies in acquisition

the government will put new visa procedures into 
place to make it faster and easier for foreign entrepreneurs 
scientists and technicians to visit the soviet union an official 
said tuesday 
the streamlined rules beginning sunday are part of broader 
reform of soviet economic and foreign policy oleg v avramenko 
first deputy chief of the foreign ministrys consular directorate 
told a news briefing 
the new procedure for entry into this country reflects the 
logic of the course of soviet foreign policy which is oriented 
toward active development of economic scientific and technical 
contacts with western and developing countries he said 
under leader mikhail gorbachev the soviets have been wooing 
foreign investors proposing joint projects with firms abroad and 
seeking to use western capital and expertise to revitalize the 
staterun economy 
for years securing an entry visa to the soviet union has been a 
timeconsuming affair with delays that often stretched into months 
starting sunday however it will be the practice of soviet 
consulates abroad to issue visas within 48 hours to foreign 
business people technicians and scientists who already have 
established contacts with the soviet union avramenko said 
he said foreigners would need an invitation from a soviet firm 
or governmental agency in order to receive quickest 
attentionhowever others who desire to explore economic or 
professional opportunities may still gain a visa at soviet 
consulates within about five days avramenko said 
there will also be a maximum broadening of the granting of 
multiple entry visas documents valid for two or three years that 
allow bearers to enter and leave the soviet union as often as they 
want the diplomat said

the reagan administration affirmed its 
determination tuesday to push a 460 million arms purchase by saudi 
arabia through a reluctant congress with the argument that 
enhancing awacs radar planes is essential to protect us navy 
forces in the persian gulf 
a bipartisan group of 187 house members has written secretary of 
state george p shultz opposing the sale of advanced us equipment 
in light of the saudis recent secret purchase of missiles from 
china that could devastate israel in the senate 58 members are on 
record against the deal 
but state department spokesman charles e redman said the saudis 
had given assurances the missiles would not be nucleararmed and 
had decided to sign the 1968 nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
under the accord states without nuclear weapons agree not to 
make or acquire them 
we have not changed our view that the awacs maintenance 
package is critical to our gulf policy redman told reporters 
the saudi awacs operation provides important support for the us 
mission in the gulf including protection of us navy personnel 
and equipment 
american warships are protecting usflagged kuwaiti oil 
tankers in the war between iran and iraq a number of clashes with 
iran resulted above the strait of hormuz through which cargoes 
pass 
the area is patrolled by us radar planes with the saudi awacs 
or airborne warning and control system aircraft confined to the 
southern region state department officials told members of 
congress last week in a secret briefing 
in the south us forces are under threat of silkworm antiship 
missiles iran purchased from china 
the decision to sell new equipment to the saudis sets the stage 
for a debate may 9 when the senate foreign relations committee is 
due to hold a hearing on the nomination of walter cutler to be 
ambassador to saudi arabia 
the missiles china sold to the saudis are capable of carrying 
nuclear or chemical warheads and have a range of about 1600 miles 
they add to israels security concerns that were heightened last 
year when syria obtained missiles from the soviet union that also 
could rocket israeli population centers with deadly chemical 
weapons 
rep charles schumer dny said 186 other house members had 
signed a letter he wrote urging shultz to withdraw the proposed 
sale 
redman said shultz had not replied yet but the spokesman said 
we expect to go forward with the formal notification in the near 
term 
when that step is taken the deal will go through unless both 
the house and senate vote to reject it within 30 days 
the saudis have assured us that their missiles would not be 
nuclearcapable redman said by adhering to the npt nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty saudi arabia would further obligate 
itself not to develop or acquire nuclear devices 
the spokesman said the state department was concerned about the 
proliferation of missiles throughout the middle east and persian 
gulf not just with the saudi purchase from china 
we remain fully committed to providing the necessary support 
to saudi arabia for the continued operation of the awacs redman 
said it is in the national security interest of the united 
states to conclude this deal 
schumer said signing the nonproliferation treaty is certainly 
a welcome move but he said it does not diminish 
congressional concerns 
the new york congressman said the chinese missiles even 
without nuclear warheads pose a real threat to the security of the 
entire region in part because they are easily equipped with 
chemical warheads 
he added the fact that the missiles were acquired under a 
cloud of deceit only heightens our concern 
meanwhile saudi arabia was expected to announce a break in 
diplomatic relations with iran in response to iranian attacks on 
shipping in the gulf 
according to an informed source who requested anonymity the 
saudi council of ministers took the decision at a meeting monday 
night 
saudi arabia like most of the arab countries supports iraq in 
its war with iran 
the united states already protecting 11 kuwaiti oil tankers

president reagan said tuesday that american 
schools are on the mend thanks to a restoration of discipline 
homework and basic skills but we still have a long way to go 
at a ceremony marking the fifth anniversary of the landmark a 
nation at risk report reagan said a new critique from secretary 
of education william j bennett will help us find the way 
but outside the white house several hundred teachers rallied in 
lafayette park to protest the reagan administrations policies and 
heard sen lowell p weicker jr rconn call bennett the 
secretary of ignorance 
reagan said the school reforms pushed by his administration have 
brought truly revolutionary changes to american schools 
he said the national commission on excellence in education 
whose 1983 report warned of a calamity approaching from a rising 
tide of mediocrity in us schools helped heighten and 
acclerate a wave of education reform in states and communities all 
around the country 
he said it led many states to install career ladders and merit 
pay for teachers and many schools placed a new emphasis on 
quality and discipline more homework more attention to basic 
skills 
this was truly revolutionary after two decades in which money 
had been the only measure of progress in education and in which 
while federal spending on education went steadily up test scores 
fell steadily downward too many schools accepted the fashions of 
the day fashions of liberal culture that held traditional 
standards in scorn reagan said 
the key to what works is not money or being in a prosperous 
neighborhood but establishing a direction setting standards 
the president said 
bennett told reagan the bottom line of his report american 
education making it work is that american education has made 
some progress in the last few years but we are not doing well 
enough and we are not doing well enough fast enough we are still 
at risk 
earlier bennett told a news conference that the educational 
establishment is criticizing his report because they want a 
whitewash of the problem and they want a blank check 
mary hatwood futrell president of the 18 millionmember 
national education association told the teachers at the protest 
i dont want a blank check i want him to sign it 
she charged bennett was whitewashing what the administration 
is doing by coming out with another report that basically says 
theyre not doing anything 
weicker a liberal republican who has battled against reagan 
efforts to cut education spending said on the basis of the fact 
that you get what you pay for mr bennett is not the secretary of 
education hes the secretary of ignorance 
the education budget today is 21 billion compared with 148 
billion seven years ago but weicker said reagan has sought 19 
billion in cuts in the last five years futrell and other speakers 
said head start and the chapter one remedial program reach only a 
fraction of the youngsters eligible for the services 
futrell standing beneath a banner reading 1983 a nation at 
risk 1988 an administration asleep said the time has come 
for secretary bennett and president reagan to get out of the 
grandstand and into the game 
twohundred people attended the ceremony in the east room 
including eight of the 18 members of the national commission on 
excellence in education 
commission chairman david p gardner the president of the 
university of california said bennetts report was timely 
helpful tended to be constructive i believe it could have been 
written in a more positive fashion i also think it was short 
in terms of the role the federal government ought to be playing 
gardner added but i think the conclusion was correct namely 
we have a long way to go 
bennett told reporters afterwards the nea remains greatest 
single obstacle to education reform in the country 
i am not surprised that they were picketing or demonstrating 
there across the street because they have been demonstrating 
against education reform since the very beginning he said i 
have reevaluated my view of the nea and each time i reevaluate 
it its worse

former federal reserve chairman paul volcker says 
he is skeptical about some economic positions taken by the 
presidential frontrunners republican george bush and democrat 
michael dukakis 
volcker who served under presidents carter and reagan said the 
nations economic problems are not likely to be solved by vice 
president bushs pledge not to raise taxes or by massachusetts gov 
dukakis call to crack down on tax cheats 
he said the nation must increase its level of savings and must 
take action to cut the trade and budget deficits and he said 
spending on such programs as social security and medicare must be 
limited 
volcker said the next president must act promptly upon taking 
office next year or a recession could follow 
candidates actively dont want to talk about the issue 
volcker said and sometimes its better when they arent talking 
about it than when they are 
he was in atlanta monday for a competitiveness conference at the

federal trade commission chairman daniel 
oliver offered his views of the democratic presidential contenders 
tuesday criticizing proposals of jesse jackson and michael dukakis 
and scoring democrats for not condemning a 1984 jackson reference 
to new york jews 
oliver a former executive editor of the conservative national 
review said the central question of the current campaign is an 
economic one whether the policies of president reagan will be 
ratified or rejected 
the candidacy of jackson who is black represents an important 
and moving moment in history oliver said in remarks prepared for a 
luncheon at the heritage foundation 
but jacksons proposals would cost billions of dollars 
resulting in higher taxes and reducing employment instead of 
helping the poor oliver said 
in addition he went on there is a question of character 
focusing on jacksons reference to new york city as hymietown 
what if a republican contendor referred to birmingham ala as 
coontown asked oliver i cant imagine the other republican 
candidates even appearing on the same television platform with 
someone who said that 
how can mr dukakis ask for our votes when he lacks even the 
courage to condemn a man who calls jews hymies asked oliver 
and he said dukakis was far from the only silent democrat 
oliver also said the governor was not responsible for the 
economic upturn in massachusetts in recent years that improvement 
should be attributed to tax cuts instigated by reagan and former 
gov ed king said oliver 
mr dukakis may fool some people into thinking he is a trim 
healthconscious preppie but there dwells within him the soul of 
an oldfashioned cigarchomping democratic pol a veritable tip

nineteen people were arrested for allegedly 
stealing telephone access codes and selling them to hundreds of 
customers at a cost to five longdistance carriers of 45 million 
in fraudulent phone calls the government announced tuesday 
the 19 people obtained credit card numbers and access codes from 
computer hackers using specially designed programs to search phone 
systems for workable codes the us attorneys office in honolulu 
said 
the us secret service caught the 19 in an eightmonth 
undercover operation in which a secret service agent operated as an 
illegal distributor of codes through his own honolulu company 
called pacific telecommunications known to the users as the 
coconut connection 
these people hacked out these access codes using 
computers and then sold the stolen codes through illegal 
multilevel marketing schemes said steve ramsay in charge of the 
secret service office in honolulu 
hundreds of people throughout the country bought these stolen 
access codes for 100 to 150 per month for unlimited 
longdistance service ramsay added 
during the undercover operation agents made more than 600 phone 
contacts with people involved in marketing access codes and 
received from those who were indicted more than 600 illegally 
obtained codes reported the justice department in washington 
it is the largest probe of telephone access code devices in the 
industrys history 
us sprint lost 3 million as a result of the schemes and we 
would have lost at least 10 times as much if not for the success 
of the undercover operation said del wnorowski senior vice 
president and general counsel for us sprint 
secret service agents sold some us sprint longdistance access 
codes to track the extent of the illegal operations said dan bent 
the us attorney in honolulu bent said those indicted were 
highlevel distributors of telephone access codes 
after the secret service provided one distributor a code within 
four days it accumulated 73600 in illegal charges 
four federal grand jury indictments were handed down april 14 in 
honolulu as a result of the operation but were sealed until the 
arrests began monday 
the theft of telephone access codes is a recent phenomenon in 
the past three or four years weve seen it blossoming said 
robert godbey an assistant us attorney in honolulu 
the communications fraud control association a longdistance 
phone clearinghouse says losses from all types of access device 
fraud at half a billion dollars annually for the 40 billion a year

the maryland farm where the pumpkin papers 
that led to the perjury conviction of alger hiss were hidden should 
not be designated as a national historic landmark an advisory 
panel said tuesday 
it was the hiss case in 1948 that vaulted a fairly obscure young 
congressman named richard nixon to fame 
the recommendation of the advisory board of the national park 
service could be overruled interior department spokesmen said 
the board meeting in harpers ferry wva made the 
recommendation on the grounds that 50 years have not elapsed since 
the events that gave the site significance said george berklacy 
spokesman for the national park service 
the principal significant event was the retrieval of microfilm 
from a hollowedout pumpkin for nixon then a member of the house 
unamerican activities committee by the owner of the farm a time 
magazine editor named whittaker chambers 
chambers had accused hiss a former state department official 
of being a fellow member of a communist spy ring hiss sued 
chambers for libel but chambers production of the filmed state 
department documents he said hiss had given him in 1938 led to 
hiss conviction for perjury for denying to the committee that he 
had handed over the documents 
the park service generally follows a policy of letting a 50year 
interval lapse to make sure history has gained enough perspective 
on events for fair designation of landmarks berklacy said 
it is not a hard and fast rule he said the secretary of 
the interior who makes such designations has the final say and 
may overrule the board berklacy noted 
david prosperi spokesman for interior secretary donald p 
hodel hinted strongly that hodel might do just that 
it was hodel who nominated the 390acre farm at westminster 
md some 30 miles northwest of baltimore now owned by chambers 
son john 
were checking into the precedents prosperi said adding 
the secretary hasnt pushed it this hard and this far just to 
leave it here 
chambers testimony before the committee and his 1952 
autobiography witness strongly influenced a generation of 
conservatives among them president reagan who awarded a 
posthumous medal of freedom to chambers in 1984 
the case was a watershed in american life with many people 
becoming convinced by it that communists had targeted american life 
and institutions for damage if not for takeovers and others 
refusing to concede either a threat from communism or the guilt of 
hiss 
hiss who lives in new york served 44 months in prison he 
maintains his innocence chambers died in 1961 
designation as a landmark carries no obligation and no reward 
other than a plaque some 1800 sites nationwide have been made 
landmarks

police commissioner benjamin ward said tuesday 
that mayor edward i koch ought to apologize for his divisive 
attacks on jesse jackson during the new york primary 
ward the citys first black police commissioner and a koch 
appointee said the mayors acknowledgement that he had been left 
bloodied but unbowed by the uproar surrounding his criticism of 
jackson did not suffice as an apology 
its not enough to say im bloodied its not a time for 
more people to get bloodied if youre bloodied maybe you need 
florence nightingale you dont need somebody else with a bat and a 
hatchet ward told reporters at city hall 
at an appearance in washington on tuesday koch offered an 
apology for hurting black peoples feelings but stopped short of 
saying he was sorry for his remarks 
when you ask me about blacks and their sensitivity im sorry 
that i injured their feelings but i will try to redress that as 
best i can he said not just with words but with programs 
he said his new budget on may 9 would include housing health 
and education programs aimed at helping new yorks blacks 
asked if these programs were evolving because of the harsh 
criticism to which he has been subjected koch who has said he 
plans to run for a fourth term next year replied oh sure 
absolutely 
during the campaign koch criticized jacksons stand on israel 
and said jews and other supporters of that nation would be 
crazy to vote for him 
he also said he thought jacksons positions on national spending 
would bankrupt the country that his defense policy would disarm 
the united states and that he had lied about his actions the 
night the rev martin luther king was assassinated 
ward said he did not know kochs intentions in making those 
remarks 
but whatever the mayor thought he was doing im here to 
tell him and i think the whole city community black and white is 
saying that it didnt come out right ed and it has a divisive 
tone to it and there is a time for some healing and consensus 
playing that this city really cant afford whats come out of this 
and enough is enough and times is tough

based in hunt valley md is seeking to buy the companys spice

chemical warfare is being waged on larger 
scale than ever in the iraniraq war according to a un report 
released tuesday 
the report does not say who has been using the outlawed weapons 
iran and iraq have accused each other of launching chemical warfare 
attacks in the 7yearold war 
the report could prove a disappointment to iran which has been 
urging the united nations to condemn iraq for practicing chemical 
warfare 
investigations in past years confirmed that iraq used chemical 
weapons 
in releasing the 26page report secretarygeneral javier perez 
de cuellar expressed his deep sense of dismay and foreboding at 
the missions conclusions that chemical weapons continue to be used 
in the conflict and that their use in recent days has evidently 
been on an even more intensive scale than before 
un experts examined victims in iran and iraq and concluded 
most were suffering from exposure to mustard gas a world war iera 
agent a few had been exposed to a nerve gas the experts said 
the team said they examined 39 iraqi victims all military 
personnel and 66 iranians both soldiers and civilians 
iran claims iraqi victims were exposed to poisonous gases used 
by iraq on enemy troops 
dr manuel dominguez the head of the team said the use of 
yperite mustard gas was unmistakably confirmed dominguez is a 
colonel in the spanish army who specializes in nuclear biological 
and chemical weapons injuries 
even though the report did not lay blame iraq said it was 
satisfied 
it definitely bears out our contention that iran used chemical 
weapons said mudhafar alamin counselor to the iraqi mission to 
the united nations 
iranian officials refused to comment 
the un team spent three days in iran and three days in iraq 
examining victims in an iraqi military hospital in baghdad and at 
several facilities in iran 
dominguez said that because of security reasons the team 
did not visit the kurdish border town of halabja where iran says

a senate committee on tuesday approved a 
measure sought by the small aircraft industry that would place 
limits on accident liability 
the measure which was approved by the senate commerce committee 
on a voice vote would establish a series of federal standards for 
determining liability in an accident involving aircraft seating 
less than 20 people and that are not flying scheduled passenger 
routes 
the measure would replace what industry officials and private 
plane owners complain is a hodgepodge of conflicting state laws 
manufacturers argue that their insurance costs have multiplied 
by 500 percent since 1981 as a result of that increase and rising 
court judgments the number of private planes produced in this 
country has declined from a record 17000 in 1979 to 1085 last 
year the industry says 
the bill would place no limit on the amount of money a victim 
could recover in damages but in perhaps its most controversial 
provision it would prohibit accident victims from obtaining 
damages in most cases in which the aircraft was more than 20 years 
old 
consumer groups and trial lawyers have opposed the legislation 
contending it would make it too difficult for victims to collect 
damages and thus eliminate an incentive that manufacturers have to 
make the aircraft safe 
the house aviation subcommittee approved a similar bill march 3 
that would limit manufacturers liability to aircraft 12 years old 
or less but the measure faces bleak prospects in that chamber 
because three full committees public works energy and commerce 
and judiciary must complete work on the legislation before it 
reaches the house floor 
the senate panel sent the bill to the full chamber with sen 
bob packwood objecting the oregon republican complained that the 
measure would make it too difficult for passengers aboard aircraft 
involved in accidents to prove the plane was defective 
the measure is sponsored by sen nancy kassebaum rkan whose 
state is home to cessna aircraft co the beech aircraft corp and 
other private plane builders

ever wonder why it seems men are always 
waiting for women to return from the restroom in public places 
its because the standard 5050 ratio between mens and womens 
toilet facilities is not fair according to a cornell university 
undergraduate who studied the situation at highway rest stops for 
the washington department of transportation 
a more equitable arrangement would be a 6040 ratio of womens 
to mens stalls said anh tran a sophomore studying operations 
research at the ivy league school who would like to work in the 
hotel industry 
the 20yearold was one of two people hired by the washington 
department to prowl restrooms along the states highways to see why 
more women were standing in line than men 
william carr trans supervisor in washington said the agency 
was trying to document the longtime complaints of women having to 
wait to use the facilities the agency is now updating its criteria 
for rest stop design 
tran said she found that men spend an average of 45 seconds in a 
bathroom stall while women are there for an average of 79 seconds 
the men were timed by a male employee 
tran timed restroom use over the weekends last summer she also 
counted dead deer found along the roadside she isnt sure what

for all floridians to receive their just desserts the state 
house voted tuesday to designate key lime pie as the official state 
pie 
the legislation was sent to the senate on a vote of 1073 
we have been deprived too long said rep norman ostrau who 
sponsored the bill from sea to shining sea we are saying let 
there be key lime pie 
the house appeared to be on a roll for designating state 
symbols on monday the chamber approved a bill to designate myakka 
fine sand as the official state soil 
one of the three house members who voted against the key lime 
pie bill said he had had enough 
its getting absurd said rep dale patchett who also voted 
against the myakka fine sand bill it cost 500 or 600 to move 
this bill through the house besides i dont like key lime pie 
the pies can be made from the juice of any variety of the tart 
citrus fruit but some proponents say the only real ones are those 
made with the small greenishyellow variety known as the key lime 
eggs and sweetened condensed milk are the other primary 
ingredients

stella nickell accused of killing her husband 
and a second person by putting cyanide in excedrin capsules had 
discussed copying the tylenol poisoning case in which seven 
chicagoarea people died her daughter testified tuesday 
cindy hamilton said her mother suggested the 1982 tylenol 
episode would be very easy to reenact safer and less 
expensive than hiring a hit man or other ways mrs nickell had 
discussed for killing bruce nickell 
assistant us attorney joanne maida who led hamilton through 
two hours of tearful testimony asked her to explain 
in her mrs nickells own words it would have been easy 
because they were looking for looking for people shoplifting and 
taking things from the store not for putting something back 
hamilton said 
the testimony occurred in the seventh day of the nations first 
trial of anyone charged with causing death by tampering with 
overthecounter medicine the chicago case has not been solved 
nickell 52 who was hamiltons stepfather and susan katherine 
snow 40 of suburban kent both died in june 1986 after ingesting 
excedrin capsules containing cyanide 
prosecutors say the effort by mrs nickell 44 to make the two 
deaths look like random killings began to unravel when her daughter 
went to authorities 
hamilton 28 frequently sobbed as she described how her mother 
discussed at least four ways of killing nickell who died in what 
prosecutors say was a plot to collect insurance money 
government investigators found mrs nickells fingerprints in 
library books about poisons and at least one insurance policy in 
nickells name was forged prosecutors say 
hamilton said that at first she didnt think too much about what 
her mother was telling her she was an intelligent woman who 
collected information on a wide range of subjects hamilton said of 
her mother but gradually hamilton said her mother began 
mentioning nickell more often during the conversations 
i know my mother very well and basically i knew she was 
capable of it murder hamilton sobbed on the witness stand 
but i was hoping she wouldnt 
hamilton said her mother discussed hiring a hit man but 
dismissed the idea as too expensive and contemplated slipping him 
cocaine on the theory that authorities would conclude that nickell 
a recovering alcoholic had switched from alcohol to drugs and had 
accidentally overdosed 
mrs nickell related that the cocaine could be put in his tea 
it basically couldnt be tasted in iced tea hamilton quoted her 
mother as saying 
mrs nickell made one failed attempt to poison her husband by 
placing black seeds that she believed were toxic in capsules and 
giving the capsules to nickell along with his morning vitamins and 
orange juice hamilton said 
hamilton said her mother also asked her how much heroin was 
needed for an overdose but never linked that question to her 
repeated tales of dissatisfaction with nickell 
when her mother initially asked about buying heroin and other 
drugs i thought she may have possibly been thinking about 
acquiring it heroin to supplement her income she said 
i just couldnt picture my mother selling drugs she said

saudi arabia announced tuesday it 
was breaking diplomatic relations with iran and asked iranian 
embassy officials to leave the kingdom within a week 
the announcement read on staterun television said the rupture 
came about because of several reasons among them were a riot by 
iranians during a pilgrimage to mecca last year and a subsequent 
attack on the saudi embassy in tehran it said 
an informed source in washington who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said the saudi council of ministers made the decision at

in mecca on july 31 1987 that killed 275 iranian pilgrims and the 
subsequent ransacking of the saudi embassy in tehran by mobs a 
saudi diplomat later died of injuries sustained in the attack 
the saudis said a total of 402 people were killed in a stampede 
after a political demonstration by the iranians turned violent 
tehran said that saudi police caused most of the casualties by 
shooting into the crowd 
mecca the birthplace of prophet mohammed and medina site of 
mohammeds tomb are the holiest places for the worlds 850 million 
moslems 
they are located in a western saudi arabian region known as 
hijaz 
after the mecca riots iranian leaders called for the overthrow 
of king fahd and the saudi royal family the seizure of its vast 
wealth and for stripping them of the custodianship of the holy 
shrines 
officials of the prowestern conservative kingdom accused irans 
revolutionary leaders of terrorism 
two weeks ago ayatollah ruhollah khomeini said that 150000 
iranian pilgrims would travel to mecca this year and stage 
demonstrations against the united states and israel 
saudi arabia had said it would cut the number of pilgrims 
traveling to the holy city this year but has not announced any

the soviets have shown a singleminded 
attitude in improving submarine communications and may lead the 
united states in developing powerful signals a military 
publication said wednesday 
the 1988 edition of janes military communications said 
however that the united states was generally believed ahead in 
research into laseraided submarine communications the most 
advanced form 
the work has gained importance because of the key role of 
submarinelaunched ballistic missiles under the superpower 
agreement to eliminate medium and shorterrange landbased nuclear 
missiles from europe 
the highly penetrating extremely low frequency communications 
are resistant to jamming can operate at great depths and can 
survive a nuclear explosion said janes the manuel said the 
united states was ahead in the less powerful of such signals those 
that penetrate down to nine yards 
it said the united states was also leading in finding ways to 
use laser transmitters carried on board satellites to relay 
messages to submarines from shore installations aircraft or 
surface vessels 
such light can penetrate hundreds of yards beneath salt water 
editor john williamson said in a forward to the manual

the senate foreign relations committee voted 
161 tuesday to subpoena the private working diaries of lt col 
oliver l north in its continuing investigation of international 
drug smuggling 
sen john kerry dmass expressed concern that the originals 
of the north diaries have never been turned over to government 
authorities in uncensored form but remain in the hands of north and 
his attorney brendan v sullivan 
the subpoena calls for north and sullivan to produce 2848 pages 
of handwritten diary notes in their entirety and with no deletions 
the notes cover the period from september 1984 until november 
1986 when north was fired from his position on the national 
security council in the irancontra arms and money furor 
a version of the north diary already has been made available to 
the congressional irancontra committees but kerry said north and 
sullivan heavily censored 1269 pages with black ink 
speaking of the north diaries kerry told the committee im 
not asserting that theres a smoking gun or something hidden or 
that some of the redactions deletions are not appropriate my 
assertion is that given what has already been declassified i dont 
know how we can proceed with our investigation without being able 
to see all of it 
the issue is one of investigation kerry said should we 
have the right to look at these classified documents a work 
product of a government employee 
seventyfour pages of norths notes were released tuesday often 
interspersed in notations about logistics of the war effort of the 
nicaraguan contra rebels are numerous references to drugs the drug 
enforcement administration and the customs service panamanian 
ruler gen manuel antonio noriega and cia agents 
but kerry complained that most such references are preceeded or 
followed with large blackedout sections 
one note dated june 27 1984 says drug case dea progress 
on combatting cocaine and refers to possible colombian 
negotiations to move drug refining to nicaragua 
an entry from the previous month notes that cia latin american 
chief duane clarridge had called and indicated that name 
deleted contact indicates that gustavo is involved with drugs 
it is unclear to whom gustavo refers 
a july 24 1984 entry states clarridge paragraph deleted 
arturo cruz jr get alfredo cesar on drugs 
the passages meaning is unclear cruz is the son of a former 
member of the directorate of the united nicaraguan opposition at 
that time the contra political umbrella cesar now a member of the 
contra political directorate was at the time associated with the 
southern front in the nicaraguan civil war which was at odds with 
uno 
kerry has made clear he believes there was a connection between 
drug running and efforts to supply and arm the contras some 
testimony before his subcommittee on narcotics and terrorism has 
focused on that possibility 
contra leaders however have denied involvement in drug 
trafficking 
censored versions of the diaries originally were provided to the 
congressional irancontra committees under the grant of limited 
immunity from prosecution given to north in exchange for his 
testimony before the panel last year 
kerry said that in order to speed up the process the irancontra 
panels permitted north and sullivan to block out sections they 
deemed to be irrelevant to that investigation 
but kerry said john nields chief counsel of the house 
irancontra committee said there were many sections that appeared 
to be very relevant to the kerry narcotics investigation 
and he made public a letter in which sen daniel k inouye 
dhawaii chairman of the senate irancontra committee said i 
share your belief that the portion of the diaries which was 
withheld from the select committees may contain important 
information relevant to your inquiry 
sullivans law office here had no immediate comment on the 
subpoena or on whether he and north would comply with it 
kerry said he was prepared to go the distance in pursuit of 
norths diaries if they resist it will seem to me that there is 
even more reason to believe there is something there that we have 
to see 
north is facing trial on federal charges in the irancontra 
affair but kerry said he had been assured by the staff of 
irancontra independent counsel lawrence e walsh that making the 
documents available to the foreign relations committee would not 
interfere with the prosecution 
north and three codefendants were indicted by a federal grand 
jury on march 16 on conspiracy theft and wire fraud charges 
centering on the secret sale of us weapons to iran and the 
alleged diversion of the proceeds to the contras 
additionally north was named in nine separate counts for 
allegedly obstructing congress making false statements obstructing 
justice and a presidential inquiry destroying official documents 
and conspiring to defraud the internal revenue service 
only sen jesse helms rnc voted against issuing the 
subpoena saying he did so because he believed that north a 
personal friend already is bearing a too heavy legal burden

sen bob dole criticizing news coverage of 
his unsuccessful campaign for the republican presidential 
nomination said tuesday that reporters were more interested in 
gossip and nitpicking than in covering the issues 
dole the senate republican leader said in a floor speech that 
overall coverage of the 1988 presidential primaries was issueless 
and negative 
the senator from kansas said a predominantly liberal press corps 
gave republican candidates far more negative treatment than the 
democratic candidates 
what i witnessed generally on my own campaign plane was an 
aircraft filled with reporters who became each others best 
audience dole said it was an ultrainsiders game of gossip 
and nitpicking that turned presidential campaign coverage into 
trivial pursuits 
dole cited a recent usa today newspaper study he said showed 
network television coverage of the 1988 presidential campaign has 
focused 80 percent of its time on everything but issues 
there was coverage of all kinds of gossip and horse race 
stories and judging from my own experience whos on or off the 
dole campaign plane which reporter will find that one person in a 
friendly audience who can serve up a juicy negative quote and on 
and on and on 
he said the media were more interested in putting political 
gossip above information and titilation above education 
dole also said gop candidates received more negative treatment 
than democratic candidates 
something is out of whack and something is disturbingly 
unfair when news coverage becomes so slanted and the issues get 
lost in the daily hype he said 
look at the news rooms dole said lets face it they 
tend to be liberal in all honesty how many republicans are out 
there covering the candidates or congress i dont think i could 
guess more than a carload 
reporters try to be objective dole said but try as they 
do they just cant help but see the world through liberal colored 
glasses 
dole said his audiences wanted to know where he stood on 
individual issues unfortunately the american people are not 
getting what they want at least from the news media he said 
its a shame the media cant keep up with the people dole 
said

the united states and canada will not reach 
agreement on a way to reduce acid rain emissions before the reagan 
administration leaves office a senior administration official 
predicted tuesday on the eve of a visit by canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney 
the official who spoke only on the condition of anonymity 
denied that president reagan agreed during a meeting with mulroney 
in ottawa last april to commit the united states to specific 
targets and timetables for the reduction of emissions 
mulroney in a conversation with american reporters in the 
canadian capital on friday said he was disappointed with the 
administrations lack of action against us smokestack emissions 
that he says are killing lakes and damaging forests north of the 
border 
and the canadian embassy in washington in a booklet distributed 
in advance of wednesays meeting between reagan and mulroney said 
canada cannot solve the problem on its own canada is taking 
action and we expect the united states to do likewise 
meanwhile 19 senators including six republicans released a 
letter they had sent to reagan urging him to reach agreement with 
mulroney at the meeting on the environmental issue 
it would be most fitting for you to end your last summit 
meeting with prime minister mulroney with an agreement to control 
acid rain the letter said 
the senators most of them from the northeast included george 
mitchell dmaine principal author of a clean air bill awaiting 
floor action and robert stafford of vermont senior republican on 
the senate environment committee 
reagans agreement to seek a bilateral accord with canada on the 
issue was inserted during his meeting with mulroney in ottawa in 
a speech the president made later in the day at the canadian 
parliament 
the official who was present at the meeting said reagan 
hasnt changed his mind about trying to reach an agreement 
but the official said that when the united states later proposed 
an accord it did not meet what canada apparently wanted in this 
specific area which is targets and timetables 
i am not aware of any time that the two leaders agreed that 
the accord would include targets and timetables the 
administration official said 
instead the official said reagan and mulroney agreed to try 
to find a bilateral accord that moved us ahead a little but we 
havent been able to 
canada proposed a draft treaty calling for a 44 percent 
reduction in estimated northbound flow of sulfur dioxide a 
pollutant from coalfired power plants and other sources that 
provides a key raw material for making acid rain of about 23 
million tons of us sulfur dioxide emissions about 4 million tons 
flows north across the border an amount canada proposed should be 
limited to 22 million tons 
reagan and mulroney did agree two years ago that the united 
states should pursue a 5 billion fiveyear demonstration effort 
to move clean coal combustion technologies into commercial use 
in a way that would reduce pollution flow across the boundary 
though congress has cooperated in providing the governments half 
share of the money few projects are under way yet and 
environmentalists criticize the program as little more than a pork 
barrel for the coal and utility industries 
asked whether the united states and canada would be able to 
reach agreement by jan 20 when the reagan administration leaves 
office on an approach that will significantly reduce acid rain 
the official said no i dont it is a difference in approach 
if you are going to put a lot of money into something you had 
better make sure you have the right technology the official 
said you had better know there is a direct relationship between 
what you are doing and where the acid deposition is coming from 
when asked whether this meant the administration considered the 
problem too costly to tackle the official said it is too dear 
if you are using the wrong technologies and when you get all done 
you havent solved the canada problem people are just simply very 
reluctant to say here we go full tilt and when you get done you 
havent solved the problem as it addresses itself in the 
uscanadian relationship

the international court of justice 
ruled tuesday that the united states violated its treaty with the 
united nations in its attempt to close the palestine liberation 
organization mission in new york 
the court which has no enforcement powers sided with the 
united nations and ruled that the plo issue must go to independent 
arbitration it rebuked the reagan administration for its efforts 
to close the plo mission 
the united states sought a new york federal court order to close 
the mission after president reagan signed new antiterrorist 
legislation in december under the law the plo is classified as a 
terrorist organization and is prevented from operating on us 
soil 
the us court has not yet acted 
the world court president jose maria ruda reading from the 
25page opinion said the closure proceedings violated a 1947 pact 
between the united states and the united nations that assured 
diplomats unhindered access to the international organization 
that accord called the the headquarters agreement calls for 
arbitration in such disputes the united states has rejected 
arbitration 
the us government maintains that the antiterrorist law is 
exempt from any international legal obligations that the united 
states may have under the headquarters agreement 
the reagan administration move against the plos american 
presence has been condemned by all un member nations except the 
united states and israel 
carlaugust fleischhauer of west germany the un 
undersecretarygeneral for legal affairs told reporters after 
tuesdays ruling that he was not optimistic that the united states 
would submit to arbitration 
although we want harmonious relations with our host country 
we are satisfied that the court spoke in the same sense as we 
did fleischhauer said 
we are ready to go to arbitration it is now basically for the 
united states government to decide what conclusions it draws from 
this ruling he said 
the plo was granted permanent observer status by the united 
nations general assembly in 1974 and its un mission has been 
operating since then out of an office in manhattan 
the plos information office in washington was closed down prior 
to passage of the american legislation 
early this year the us government said that arbitration was 
premature noting that the antiterrorist law would go into effect 
on march 22 
when the plo refused to comply with us attorney general edwin 
meese iiis march 22 order to close down its manhattan office the 
us government filed suit in federal court 
the american judge on the world court stephen m schwebel 
voted against washington 
in a separate opinion schwebel said that although he had 
reservations about the courts opinion a state cannot avoid its 
international responsibility by referring issues such as the plo 
mission dispute to a domestic court 
since only sovereign states and un bodies are entitled to 
bring cases before the court the plo has been unable to plead its 
case but confidential briefs believed to support its position have 
been filed by syria and east germany 
in 1986 the court ordered a halt to reagan administration 
support for the rebels fighting the leftist nicaraguan government 
ruling that the support violated international law but the united 
states boycotted most of those proceedings claiming the court had 
no jurisdiction in the case

in another attack on the legacy of josef stalin a 
newspaper gave details tuesday about the removal of his body from 
the red square mausoleum where the body of soviet founder vladimir 
i lenin is entombed 
the labor newspaper trud published an article in response to a 
question from an 18yearold soldier v kuzmin who said many 
young soviets knew nothing about the removal of stalins body from 
the mausoleum in 1961 
under the more open atmosphere fostered by soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev soviet scholars and journalists have begun 
reevaluating stalins record he ruled the soviet union from 1927 
until his death in 1953 
under his dictatorship millions of people perished in purges 
forced collectivization of agriculture and rapid industrialization 
trud said that when stalin died many people did not know of 
the circumstances connected with the gross political mistakes 
massive repression and lawlessness during his regime 
stalins body was removed from the mausoleum and buried in the 
kremlin wall during the night of oct 31nov 1 1961 at the time 
of the 22nd communist party congress 
the party was led at that time by nikita s khrushchev who had 
denounced stalins cult of personality during a secret speech 
to party officials five years earlier 
col ka moshkov who was in charge of overseeing the 
mausoleum told trud he was called to the kremlin for a meeting 
oct 31 at which officials decided where to place stalins body 
he said the officials had considered placing it in moscows 
novodevichy cemetery where stalins wife nadezhda was buried after 
she committed suicide in 1932 but agreed to place it in the 
kremlin wall 
moshkov told trud that soldiers moved the body during the night 
with only stalins daughter svetlana present 
in the morning the official news media carried a onesentence 
statement that stalins body had been moved 
lenins body has been enshrined in the mausoleum since his death 
in 1924 
in a speech last november gorbachev said stalins guilt was 
enormous and unforgivable but he defended the former leaders 
basic policies

a defense lawyer for irancontra defendant 
albert hakim accused prosecutors tuesday of violating a court order 
by trying to limit his clients access to classified documents 
compiled in the case 
the procedures proposed by independent counsel lawrence e walsh 
to limit hakims right to see certain highly sensitive government 
documents directly contravene us district judge gerhard a 
gesells order defense lawyer n richard janis charged in court 
papers 
janis said walshs proposal also would limit access of retired 
air force maj gen richard v secord hakims former business 
partner who also is charged with participating in the illegal 
conspiracy to divert usiran armssale profits to the nicaraguan 
contra rebels 
the two brokered the arms sales through a series of swissbased 
companies which also funneled money to the contras 
under the proposal by walshs office all classified documents 
turned over to the defense would be made available to lawyers for 
hakim and secord as well as counsel for the other two defendants 
marine lt col oliver l north and former national security 
adviser john m poindexter 
north a fired national security council aide and poindexter 
also would be allowed to review all documents furnished to the 
lawyers according to a proposal outlined in a letter sent by 
walshs office this week to defense counsel 
before they left the white house staff in november 1986 both 
north and poindexter had security clearances and access to the 
nations most wellkept secrets and presumably saw or generated 
much of the material collected by walshs investigators 
but walshs proposal said hakim and secord would not get 
automatic access to particularly sensitive information 
this material includes documents whose disclosure would 
jeopardize the lives of hostages in the middle east or compromise 
us intelligence methods particularly sensitive military 
operations and extremely sensitive foreign policy 
initiatives according to the letter 
hakim a native of iran who has us citizenship has never had 
access to government documents secord who once held sensitive 
positions in the pentagon held a number of security clearances 
before his air force retirement 
gesell ordered walsh on april 15 to allow the defense to review 
some 300000 pages of classified material to determine if it would 
help their case an interagency task force is checking the material 
before it is turned over to the defendants to see what highly 
sensitive information is included 
the sensitive documents covered by walshs proposal comprise 
between 5 percent and 10 percent of the material reviewed so far 
defense lawyers were told at a recent meeting with prosecutors 
under the proposal that janis contends violates gesells april 
15 order defense lawyers could show hakim and secord certain 
sensitive documents only after obtaining the judges permission 
it would be within the courts discretion to solicit the 
government for its views and to make special arrangements for 
access as the court deems appropriate associate independent 
counsel geoffrey stewart wrote in the letter outlining the proposal 
to defense counsel 
during the hearing janis told gesell that hakim has no less a 
need than the other defendants to review the documents 
gesell assured janis that he would not bar defense lawyers from 
telling their clients anything about the case including 
information in classified documents 
in his protective order the judge said the defendants and their 
lawyers could gain access to the documents if they signed 
agreements not to disclose the information 
gesells order warned that unauthorized disclosure could result 
in prosecution and he set stringent conditions for working with the 
documents in a special secure area being constructed by the justice 
department 
janis said the proposed procedures directly contravene the 
courts protective order which places only limited conditions on 
access to classified information all of which were met by mr 
hakim and his counsel 
both judicial precedent and the pronouncements of this court 
make it clear that the government must now give mr hakim access to 
the information in its possession or face dismissal of the 
indictment against mr hakim janis said 
under the classified information procedures act classified 
documents deemed relevant to the case could only be introduce as 
evidence by either side if they are declassified by the government 
at the april 12 hearing gesell warned that he would be forced 
to dismiss the case if walsh were unable to get relevant documents 
declassified the classification system must be adjusted to the 
needs of the case or the case will collapse gesell said

saudi arabia accused iran of 
terrorism and subversion and broke relations tuesday ordering 
all iranian diplomats to leave the kingdom within a week 
a statement broadcast by staterun television and distributed by 
the official saudi press agency cited a riot by iranians during a 
pilgrimage to mecca last year in which hundreds of people died a 
subsequent attack on the saudi embassy in tehran and attacks on 
commercial shipping in the persian gulf 
on sunday iranian speedboats attacked a saudiowned tanker in 
the strait of hormuz hours after president reagan warned iran to 
stay clear of neutral ships 
an informed source in washington said privately that the saudi 
council of ministers decided monday night to end diplomatic 
relations with ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis revolutionary regime 
saudi arabia and most other arab countries support iraq in its 
war with iran which began in september 1980 iran is a moslem 
nation but its people are persian not arab 
the saudi statement said that king fahds government exercised 
selfrestraint and prudence for a long time despite iranian 
practices that run counter to norms and diplomatic traditions 
before deciding on the break 
a memorandum about the decision was handed to the iranian charge 
daffaires in riyadh the news agency reported 
according to the published statement the government of saudi 
arabia has decided to sever its ties with the government of the 
islamic republic of iran and asked all personnel of the iranian 
embassy in riyadh and the consulate general in jiddah to leave the 
kingdom within a week 
reagan warned iran on saturday five days after the us navy 
sank or disabled six iranian naval vessels against continuing 
attacks on neutral shipping 
iran and saudi arabia have made virulent statements about each 
other since riots in mecca on july 31 1987 that killed 275 
iranian pilgrims and the subsequent sacking of the saudi embassy in 
tehran a saudi diplomat died of injuries suffered in the attack 
saudi security officials said 402 people were killed in a 
stampede after an iranian political demonstration in mecca turned 
violent iran said saudi police caused most of the casualties by 
shooting into the crowd 
mecca birthplace of the prophet mohammed and medina site of 
his tomb are the holiest places for the worlds 850 million 
moslems they are in a region of western saudi arabian called hijaz 
iranian leaders who often threaten to export their 
fundamentalist revolution to saudi arabia and other gulf nations 
exhorted the worlds moslems after the mecca riots to overthrow the 
saudi royal family seize its vast wealth and take away 
custodianship of the islamic shrines 
officials of the prowestern kingdom accused iran of terrorism 
two weeks ago khomeini said 150000 iranian pilgrims would 
travel to mecca this year and demonstrate against the united states 
and israel 
government officials had said saudi arabia would reduce the 
number of pilgrims traveling to the holy city this year but have 
not given figures iran reacted by threatening to boycott the 
annual pilgrimage 
saudi arabia is the leading member of the gulf cooperation 
council an economic and defense alliance that also includes 
kuwait the united arab emirates bahrain qatar and oman 
arab diplomatic sources said it was unlikely other council 
members would follow the saudi lead and break with iran despite 
iranian missile attacks on kuwaiti territory and raids on the 
emirates offshore oil facilities 
earlier tuesday king fahd decided to sign an international 
treaty limiting the spread of nuclear arms the move apparently 
came in response to israeli fears that the kingdom might arm its 
missiles with nuclear warheads

democrat michael dukakis captured 71 
percent of the vote in utahs caucuses in his strongest showing yet 
in the west 
with just over 90 percent of the vote counted tuesday the state 
democratic partys unofficial tally showed dukakis with 7550 votes 
to jesse jacksons 1682 or 16 percent some 1231 or 12 percent 
were uncommitted 
based on those tallies dukakis would pick up 21 of utahs 23 
democratic delegates while jackson would gain two 
party officials said vote counting from mondays caucuses was 
progressing slowly tuesday because of debate over a rule governing 
uncommitted delegates and difficulties in contacting some county 
leaders to get their returns 
official results were not likely to change the outcome for 
dukakis however who already has won commitments from three of the 
states five super delegates bringing his utah delegate total 
to 24 
were really happy its his biggest victory in the west 
said gary knoblock dukakis state campaign coordinator its a 
long way from home to be winning by this kind of margin weve been 
slowly climbing in the west but this took a quantum leap 
still dukakis supporters showed respect for jacksons showing 
in a state with a white population of 93 percent and where jackson 
received only 4 percent of the vote in 1984 
he has moved the population that has not been involved in 
politics said pat shea dukakis state cochairman 
the votes that came in for jackson were certainly not 
allinclusive minority votes i feel very good about what weve 
done said jackson state chairman marvin davis 
republicans faced fewer choices at mondays caucuses which 
included mainly advisory votes on their preferences for vice 
president and whether they favor holding a western regional primary 
in 1992 similar to the souths super tuesday 
results of the republican balloting will not be available for 
several days gop chairman craig moody said but i know that 
elizabeth dole howard baker and interior secretary donald hodel

a restructuring of federal airline and 
interstate highway programs would eliminate bureaucratic practices 
that interfere with aviation safety and road improvements us 
transportation secretary jim burnley said tuesday 
when the interstate highway system is completed in the next few 
years the states should assume responsibility for their roads 
because that way the projects with the most merit would get top 
priority burnley said 
costly and extraneous federal requirements now imposed on the 
use of funds could be virtually eliminated ensuring a greater 
transportation return on every dollar spent he told a convention 
of the american automobile association 
we are looking at ways to encourage and promote innovative 
financing mechanisms such as permitting the use of tolls on 
highways built with federal funds he said 
burnley who has proposed a reshaping of the federal aviation 
administration told reporters that the faa has never done an 
adequate job of safety regulation and enforcement of the airline 
industry because it is subjected to the federal budgetary process 
and is operated through a maze of federal laws and rules 
there is a morass of inhibitions on its growth and proper 
management said burnley who took over as transportation 
secretary from elizabeth dole in december 
he has described the faa as a hybrid agency that combines 
safety regulation and enforcement duties with the nutsandbolts 
operation of running the airtraffic control system burnley would 
like to separate the faas safety role from its operational 
functions and there is a move afoot in congress to separate the 
faa from the transportation department 
burnley indicated he agreed with efforts to do so he didnt say 
how this should be done but he said he would oppose turning air 
traffic functions over to a privately run company 
on airline safety burnley said weve tried to toughen up 
inspections across the board pointing to the current 
investigation of texas air corps eastern airlines 
the 30day planebyplane inspection of easterns fleet which 
began april 13 is evaluating easterns ability to comply with faa 
safety standards and has resulted in a proposed 823000 in fines 
against the airline 
burnley who flew to orlando from washington on eastern said 
the airline is one of the safest if not the safest airlines in 
america because of the attention it has received i flew it 
with extreme confidence today 
a similar inspection is also going on at continental another 
texas air subsidiary 
the transportation secretary said the faa investigation was 
under way before easterns pilots began a postcard campaign 
detailing alleged maintenance and safety violations 
i really resent the leadership of the union and the company 
using safety issues as a weapon against each other burnley 
told a press conference he said the two sides could duke it 
out without resorting to safety allegations 
in his luncheon speech to the aaa convention burnley said the 
1987 traffic fatality rate was the lowest in history with 24 
deaths per 100 million miles traveled 
there were just over 46000 americans killed on our highways 
last year which is tragic by any standard he said but if 
fatalities were still occurring at the 1980 rate the death toll 
would have been 17000 higher both numbers are mindboggling 
he credited the reduction in highway accidents to the crackdown 
on drunken and druggeddrivers the greater use of seat belts and 
new safety rules affecting trucks 
burnley said it was too early to say what effect the new 65 mph 
speed limit on rural interstate highways was having on safety

the reagan administration and law enforcement 
groups agreed tuesday on compromise legislation to ban undetectable 
plastic handguns using an approach that has been staunchly opposed 
by the national rifle association and its legislative supporters 
joseph a morris director of the justice departments office of 
liaison said the proposed legislation would be sent to congress 
this week 
the compromise represents a change in position for attorney 
general edwin meese iii who earlier endorsed the nra approach 
meese now believes that the compromise language is more 
enforceable morris said 
the approach to dealing with plastic guns which are not yet 
being manufactured has generated the latest raging debate between 
the nra and handgun control groups 
gun control groups joined by police organizations have been 
lobbying for a bill that would require a minimum standard of metal 
in any gun so that the weapon would trigger an alarm in todays 
metal detectors 
the nra has supported a bill by sen james mcclure ridaho 
which would ban undetectable plastic weapons but would set no 
minimum standard of metal mcclures approach however says that 
weapons must be detectable by existing magnetometers 
after several rounds of highpowered lobbying fullpage 
advertisements fundraising appeals and doomsday rhetoric by all 
sides the administration has adopted the minimum metallic standard 
as the best approach 
nra officials were not immediately available for comment on 
whether they would accept the new approach 
but last year the nra said a bill sponsored by sen howard m 
metzenbaum dohio which included a minimum metallic standard 
would make a number of small existing handguns unlawful and amount 
to the first federal gun ban bill in america 
morris said no currently made guns would be barred under the 
compromise standard and said he hoped everyone can claim 
victory 
morris said neither the nra nor the gun control groups were part 
of the negotiations 
mcclure commenting on the compromise said he believes the 
proposal brings all sides closer together although he stopped 
short of an endorsement 
but he added that if the new language would not ban any existing 
guns there would be little substantive difference between the two 
measures 
what we were trying to make certain of is that this is a 
detection bill and not a confiscation bill mcclure said 
the senator said the nra was aware of the new language and 
reacted cautiously they want to make certain we dont get into 
the realm of confiscation of weapons owned by lawabiding 
citizens he said 
the compromise was hammered out quietly by the justice treasury 
and transportation departments and the law enforcement steering 
committee representing 11 of the nations major law enforcement 
groups 
meese said earlier this year that he backed the mcclure bill 
but morris declined to say that meese had backtracked commenting 
instead that the attorney general will say heres another route 
that we think is optimal were not turning back on the mcclure 
bill we think this is a better bill its more enforceable 
meese ordered a large inhouse study on how detection works 
morris said and administration experts accepted a metallic 
standard of 37 ounces of stainless steel 
that figure means any gun passing through a magnetometer must be 
as detectable as one with 37 ounces of stainless steel such a 
standard allows a weapon to have less metal or a different type of 
metal as long as the standard is met 
the legislation does not specifically mention plastic guns but 
would ban any weapon that does not meet the standard 
so far red eye arms of winter park fla says it has a patent 
for plastic weapons but wont start making such handguns for at 
least two years and then will only make them for military and 
police use 
martha plotkin the chairperson of the law enforcement steering 
committee said the compromise was not aimed at opposing the nra 
but at writing legislation that is workable and would protect the 
public 
she said the nra should be given an opportunity to look at 
this without it being put to them as something theyre not going to 
like 
metzenbaum whose current bill has a slightly higher metallic 
standard than the compromise said he was pleased to hear the 
justice department has listened to the very legitimate concerns of 
the law enforcement community concerning undetectable weapons 
from what we understand of the justice proposal it is fully 
compatible with our legislation and i expect we will be able to 
incorporate it he said 
his bill is cosponsored by sen strom thurmond rsc who was 
influential in bringing the law enforcement groups and the 
administration together 
in the house the judiciary subcommittee on crime has 
unanimously approved a plastic gun bill sponsored by its chairman 
rep william j hughes dnj 
that measure which went to the full judiciary committee would 
require that plastic guns have at least 37 ounces of metal but 
has no provision that would allow lesser amounts of metal that 
would also trigger the alarm 
hughes asked about the compromise said he prefers to use his 
own bill as the vehicle for plastic gun legislation because it has 
already begun moving through the house with bipartisan support 
he added however i dont think theres any significant 
difference between the two proposals

the government said tuesday it has 
hired the firm of us oilwell firefighter paul red adair to 
put out a blaze at the countrys largest offshore oil field 
carlos pinto spokesman for the government oil firm petrobras 
said two employees of the adair company based in houston arrived 
in rio early tuesday 
he said they went directly to the enchova oil field in the 
campos basin 120 miles east of rio where a fire has been burning 
out of control at an offshore rig since sunday 
the enchova field and four connected fields have been shut down 
cutting brazils oil production by 71000 barrels a day the 
countrys daily production is 615000 barrels 
pinto said the fire started with a gas leak at an oil rig 50 
miles off the coast and all 250 workers were evacuated unharmed 
four ships with water cannons sprayed the rig around the clock 
to minimize damage but could not put out the blaze according to 
pinto 
there are two possibilities for putting out the fire he 
said one is to dig a parallel well and draw off the oil and gas 
feeding the fire the other is the americans way with an 
explosion that uses up oxygen and kills the fire 
petrobras plans to import an additional 60000 barrels of oil a 
day at a cost of about 1 million to cover most of the loss of 
production from enchova 
the platform itself cost 330 million and is covered by 
insurance a few towers fell down but apparently it will not be 
destroyed by the fire pinto said 
the campos basin is brazils richest oil region and has produced 
370000 barrels daily but brazil still needs more oil and imports 
in the first quarter averaged 718000 barrels per day

following is a translation by the 
associated press of the saudi arabian governments memorandum on 
the rupture of ties with iran 
in view of the iranian hostile attitude toward the kingdom of 
saudi arabia the premeditated offenses to basic saudi interests 
and as a result of the iranian government attitude that runs 
counter to the principles of international law and diplomatic 
traditions 
on account of irans violation of the principles of good 
neighborliness and mutual respect as exemplified in the attempt to 
smuggle explosives into the kingdom during the pilgrimage season of 
the year 1406 1986 to imperil the safety of pilgrims and the 
sacred places 
because of irans manipulation of religious rituals and its 
instigation of dissent and unrest among the sons of the islamic 
nation 
due to irans repeated attempts to harm the basic interests of 
the kingdom and its obstruction of free navigation by raiding 
ships sailing to and from saudi arabia in addition to other forms 
of terrorism and subversion 
the kingdom has resorted to the attitude of selfrestraint and 
prudence required between two neighboring islamic countries it 
tried through various channels to explain to iran that the kingdom 
was eager to normalize relations on the basis of mutual respect 
but the kingdoms positive stance gained no response whatever 
from the iranian side which persisted in perpetrating hostile 
practices 
foremost among these practices was the ransacking of the tehran 
embassy of king fahd the custodian of the two holy shrines one 
saudi diplomat was killed embassy documents were looted and its 
property destroyed in that attack in addition the iranian 
authorities had failed to provide adequate security for the embassy 
personnel who were perpetually harassed forcing them all to leave 
tehran 
therefore the government of saudi arabia decided to break its 
ties with the islamic republic of iran and asked all personnel of 
the iranian embassy in riyadh and consulate general in jiddah to 
leave the kingdom within a week

president reagan has denied opportunity to 
blacks during his administration but by doing so has spurred them 
to improve their lives a high school principal known for 
unorthodox disciplinary tactics said tuesday 
reagan has played a key role in the evolution of black 
folks joe clark told about 1500 people gathered here for the 
102nd annual convention of the american newspaper publishers 
association 
what ronald reagan did was take the handout away from black 
people and make us work for ourselves he said adding that the 
result was massive voter registration by blacks 
tuesday was the second day of the threeday meeting later 
monday nbc news commentator john chancellor was scheduled to 
address the convention which has attracted newspaper executives 
representing 90 percent of the daily newspaper circulation in the 
united states 
clark who is black rose to prominence last year because of his 
unorthodox methods of discipline at the primarily black 
3000student eastside high school in paterson nj 
he told the mostly white audience that the us welfare economy 
had made blacks unproductive and decadent 
weve lost a generation of black folks to drugs weve lost a 
generation to illegitimacy he said 
the way to reverse the decline is to provide role models to 
bring successful blacks back into the ghettos to provide 
inspiration he said 
where are the dwight goodens of science where are the michael 
jordans of mathematics clark asked theyre out there he 
said but must return regularly to the inner city to encourage 
those left behind 
clark had a more physical solution for fighting crime 
i think a few lynchings are in order he said adding that 
the drug problem in the unites states was so severe that sometimes 
violence was the only answer 
such tough attitudes and his habit of carrying a baseball bat 
through the halls of eastside high have angered civil libertarians 
and others who say clark is all talk and little action he counters 
that he has the support of his students and their best interests in 
mind 
clarks emotional and wildly applauded speech contrasted sharply 
with a panel discussion on the status of minority workers that 
preceded it 
but the message was often the same along with encouragement 
minorities need educational opportunities to help them compete in 
the work world 
panelist gerald adolph a principal with the new york management 
consulting firm booz allen amp hamilton inc said minorities and 
women should be judged on their individual merits not considered 
universal representatives of their race sex or culture 
judge people on their own merits and give them a chance to 
succeed as individuals he said 
adolph who is black advised minority applicants not to try to 
fit into a white mold but to emphasize our diversity try to 
find companies that value our diversity 
david lawrence jr the publisher and chairman of the detroit 
free press moderated the discussion which also included roy 
roberts general motors corp vice president for personnel 
administration and development barbara f cox executive director 
for human resources at us west business resources inc of 
englewood colo and daisy chinlor an area director of human 
resources for avon products inc 
lawrence said newspapers staffed predominantly by white males 
risked ignoring the needs of many readers and becoming irrelevant 
to them 
its hard for a newsroom full of white male editors to fake 
the insight you need to relate to a diverse community of readers 
he said 
roberts said the economic survival of businesses including 
newspapers depended on staff diversity 
companies that fail to consider minorities in their marketing 
strategies will be the companies that lose the competitive 
race he said 
earlier monday martin and susan tolchin authors of buying 
into america how foreign money is changing the face of our 
nation said foreigners were buying property and businesses all 
over the country without the federal government investigating the 
longterm effects 
foreign investment is happening to us quicker than we can 
absorb it ms tolchin said

the attorney for an american businessman who 
claims the soviet union libeled him tuesday criticized the filing 
of a brief by the us justice department in defense of the 
soviets position 
attorney jerry kroll said he believes the us state department 
has made a deal a backroom political deal with the soviets to 
avoid further conflict in the 3yearold case involving raphael 
gregorian 
theyve swapped an american citizens rights for what the 
soviets want said kroll who seeks payment of both a libel 
judgment and the cost of medical supplies which gregorian sold to 
soviet hospitals before he was expelled from that country 
gregorians lifesaving medical equipment is being used in 
hospitals in the soviet union and the american government is trying 
to help the soviets weasel out of paying said kroll this case 
has gone beyond being a simple trade case 
the justice departments legal brief filed last week in the 
us 9th circuit court of appeals seeks to reopen a case which led 
to an award to gregorian for the loss of more than 200000 worth 
of medical supplies kroll meanwhile is seeking to reopen the 
libel portion of the case which was thrown out by us district 
judge david kenyon 
gregorian of palo alto did business in the soviet union for 14 
years he was operating a 10 million a year medical supply company 
in moscow when he was abruptly expelled in november 1984 izvestia 
printed an article alleging he was a spy and gregorian decided to 
sue 
in the opening rounds of his litigation gregorian won by 
default when the soviets failed to come to court but when kroll 
began seizing soviet assets to satisfy the damage judgment the 
soviets began to fight back seeking a hearing in federal court 
after long months of litigation kenyon reversed himself and 
threw out the libel award but the judge ruled that gregorian must 
be compensated for the medical supplies he left behind 
the justice departments 49page brief backs kenyons conclusion 
that the soviets should be immune from libel suits and also argues 
that they should be allowed to mount a full defense on the issue of 
paying for medical supplies 
in its brief and accompanying documents the justice department 
contended that the gregorian case has become a significant issue 
in bilateral united statessoviet relations 
kroll labeled that argument ridiculous 
we fail to see how forcing the soviets to pay for medical 
supplies will start world war iii the attorney said 
douglas letter an appellate staff attorney with the justice 
department said he would not comment further on the case or 
krolls criticism our reaction is that we are not litigating the 
case in the press he said our position is stated in the 
brief 
the soviets submitted their own brief this week stating points 
similar to those raised by the justice department it was filed by 
new york attorney martin popper who represents the soviets in the 
united states 
a key issue raised by us officials from the beginning of the 
case was whether a successful libel suit against the soviets in the 
united states would leave us citizens open to similar suits in 
the soviet union 
the justice department has offered this possibility as a reason 
for their support of the soviet position in the gregorian case

soldiers and machines filled the 
central square tuesday saluting a decade of communist rule the 
parade also was a reminder of an equally long civil war the 
regimes soviet sponsors are about to abandon 
thousands of the 40000 soldiers conscripted to defend the 
government of afghan leader najib against moslem guerrillas marched 
past the leadership in a parade modeled on red square observances 
of may day and revolution day 
soldiers workers and weapons coursed for more than two hours 
through ideghi square after a night of unusually heavy rifle fire 
and a guerrilla rocket strike in the hills east of the city 
joining the parade were 10 t62 tanks not previously known to be in 
the afghan arsenal 
najib led dozens of afghan officials and a soviet delegation to 
the parade about 500 guests and visiting journalists were 
clustered under striped awnings on a reviewing stand 
the senior soviet official was vladimir orlov head of the 
russian republics parliament his minor rank appeared to reflect 
the kremlin desire for a low profile after agreeing this month to 
start pulling its estimated 115000 soldiers out of the country on 
may 15 
yuri sapounov a foreign ministry official who accompanied 
journalists from moscow denied suggestions that the soviets were 
snubbing celebrations of the april 1978 coup that brought 
communists to power 
he acknowledged however that soviet representation was a 
contrast with a politburolevel group that went to addis ababa in 
1984 for the 10th anniversary of the marxist government that 
overthrew emperor haile selassie 
what is there to celebrate here sapounov asked there is 
a civil war going on 
a moslem insurgency began immediately after the coup that ousted 
president mohammed daoud a decade ago more than 5 million afghans 
fled about onethird of the population most of them to 
afghanistans neighbors on the east and west pakistan and iran 
towns and refugee camps that house more than 3 million afghans 
just inside pakistan serve as bases and supply points for the 
insurgents and the major guerrilla groups have their headquarters 
in pakistan 
despite a lukewarm show of kremlin support for the kabul 
festivities najibs government followed the soviet style from the 
mass demonstration of worker support to taped chants and songs 
blared across the parade ground through a scratchy public address 
system 
platoons of soldiers with sovietsupplied kalashnikov assault 
rifles paradestepped past the leaders over whom half a dozen 
bodyguards with uzi machine guns kept watch 
after sunset afghan soldiers fired shots into the air during 
private celebrations 
similar firing was heard monday night but a member of the afghan 
state committee for peace solidarity and friendship confirmed that 
a loud explosion early tuesday was a guerrilla rocket landing in 
the eastern hills 
it was especially noisy last night perhaps because they the 
guerrillas wanted to say something about the holiday said the 
official who asked that his name not be used 
on monday najib proposed a withdrawal of government soldiers 
from posts near the pakistani border to create a nonmilitary 
line between the two countries he said afghan troops would leave 
their positions if guerrillas and pakistani soldiers did the same 
the proposal seemed to be little more than a facesaving 
admission of the difficulties the afghan army has in fending off 
guerrilla attacks 
gulbaddin hekmatyar head of the sevenparty guerrilla alliance 
said tuesday in peshawar pakistan the insurgents reject the idea 
of such a zone 
afghan refugees will be reluctant to return even to those 
areas that have been abandoned by the soviet and afghan troops 
he told a news conference and they want to be convinced that 
peace has returned to afghanistan 
soviet military forces entered afghanistan in december 1979 
replaced one communist government with another and remained to help 
fight the insurgents 
najib became leader in may 1986 succeeding babrak karmal who 
is believed to be in the soviet union 
on may 15 the red army is to begin leaving afghanistan under a 
unmediated accord signed april 15 in geneva by afghanistan and 
pakistan and by the united states and soviet union as guarantors 
the united states china and several other countries have aided 
afghan guerrillas via pakistan each superpower has reserved the 
right to continue aid while the other does 
afghan insurgents were not direct parties to the geeneva 
agreement and say they will continue fighting

two senators tuesday asked the head of the 
office of government ethics to determine whether any laws were 
violated in the award of government research contracts to a company 
with employees who served on a federal advisory committee 
sens john glenn dohio and carl levin dmich said a recent 
hearing by the senate governmental affairs committee turned up 
possible conflicts of interest 
those conflicts involved two members of the eastport group an 
eightmember panel that gives advice on computer and battle 
management issues to the federal agency managing the nations 
star wars missile defense program 
those two eastport group members whose names were not 
immediately available are employed by information sciences 
institute which has won two sdi contracts 
in a letter to frank nebeker director of the office of 
government ethics glenn and levin said the two multimilliondollar 
contracts at issue pay for research directly related to 
recommendations made by the eastport group 
in fact the first contract was based on an unsolicited 
proposal by isi submitted within two weeks of the committee 
report recommending such research glenn and levin said in their 
letter both contracts were awarded under questionable 
circumstances 
when questioned about the contracts the senators said the 
defense department ended the first contract earlier than planned 
and announced it would reopen negotiations on the second 
the senators said the federal advisory committee act requires 
agencies to impose management controls on advisory committees and 
that defense department conflictofinterest rules require 
committee members to follow certain ethical standards and file 
financial disclosure forms 
they asked nebeker whether the committee members were subject to 
federal standards of conduct at the time of the contract awards 
whether any laws or regulations governing ethical conduct were 
violated and whether the matter should be referred to the justice 
department for investigation 
isi is a research group affiliated with the university of 
southern california robert biller isis vice president for 
external affairs said the institute welcomes the review by the 
office of government ethics 
we dont believe there is anything that represents an ethical 
concern or a legal problem said biller we believe 
everyone has acted in good faith

soviet television broadcast film tuesday of 
chanting crowds of thousands in two caucasus republics the first 
scenes it has shown of ethnic unrest two months ago that led to at 
least 32 deaths 
a 90minute special about the trouble in armenia and azerbaijan 
included criticism of the official press and appeared to be an 
acknowledgment that reporting on the unrest was slow and 
incomplete the host was genrikh borovik a journalist and head of 
the soviet peace committee 
the show laid much of the blame for rioting on rumors but also 
indicated silence by the media did nothing to squelch the rumors 
such a program could not have been appeared before soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachevs program of glasnost or greater 
openness it was called nagornokarabakh reflection on rumors 
and began with a woman from yerevan capital of armenia 
criticizing lack of information from the media 
i myself am not satisfied with the mass media which 
incorrectly reflected the events that took place in 
nagornokarabakh said the woman who was not identified 
central television also was silent about what happened there 
boroviks broadcast which preceded the main news program 
vremya showed blackandwhite film of thousands of chanting people 
jamming open areas in stepanakert capital of the nagornokarabakh 
region of azerbaijan 
signs visible in the crowd demanded that the region 
threefourths of whose people are ethnic armenians be annexed to 
armenia nagornokarabakh was assigned to azerbaijan in 1923 
protesters also demanded improved cultural and economic 
conditions in nagornokarabakh borovik did not reveal the origin 
of the film 
he said protests began in nagornokarabakh in midfebruary 
leading to demonstrations in yerevan by hundreds of thousands of 
people who heard rumors that protesting armenians had been killed 
more demonstrations followed in baku capital of azerbaijan he 
said 
soviet officials have rejected the demand that nagornokarabakh 
be annexed to armenia but offered a longterm program to improve 
the areas economic and cultural life 
about 15 minutes of film showed demonstrations in stepanakert 
yerevan and baku it also showed broken windows and damaged 
buildings in sumgait the city in azerbaijan where the deaths 
occurred 
the number of injured at sumgait was given as 200 much higher 
than the 81 reported april 13 by the newspaper moscow news 
officials told the program more than 80 people were under arrest on 
charges of murder or participating in the massive disorder in 
sumgait 
borovik criticized sumgait officials for negligence and said 
some lived in baku rather than the city they governed he did not 
identify them but the city communist party chief mayor and police 
chief were fired after the rioting 
according to the program 50 people were hurt in agdan a town 
in azerbaijan borovik said a criminal spread a rumor in agdam that 
a 12yearold boy had been killed by armenians in stepanakert 
a young man interviewed by borovik in yerevan criticized soviet 
media for not providing information sooner on those killed in the 
ethnic rioting reports several weeks afterward said the dead were 
26 armenians and six azerbaijanis

the drug ritalin turned a difficult 
hyperactive 9yearold boy into a zombie the boys parents 
charged as they appealed to state school officials tuesday not to 
force him to take the medicine 
casey jessons parents appealed to a state education department 
hearing officer and said they will go to court if necessary to 
override the derry school districts order that he go back on drug 
ritalin or another medication before he is allowed back in his 
thirdgrade class 
we stopped the pills after my husband suggested that he should 
get in the car with casey and drive until they hit a wall said 
caseys mother valerie life had become that much hell 
everything was coming apart 
state school hearing officer eric falkenham did not indicate 
when he would rule on the jessons appeal of the school district 
requirement that he take the medication the child is currently 
being taught by a tutor provided by the school system pending the 
outcome of the hearing 
both sides agree casey has serious behavior problems but no one 
has pinpointed the cause 
with medication casey is manageable school officials said in 
testimony submitted earlier without it they said he is 
disruptive and insults school officials and refuses to follow the 
simplest of classroom instructions 
outside the hearing derry school superintendent david brown 
said that caseys teacher sometimes had to call the principal to 
the class to physically remove casey from the room when he refused 
to go out for lunch 
rachel cobban caseys secondgrade teacher testified tuesday 
that when the boy quit taking ritalin he didnt stay in his seat 
and pestered other children i got no work from him 
he couldnt sit still even to do a fiveminute reading task 
she said adding that casey began having temper tantrums tipped 
over his desk and ate pencils and erasers 
ritalin is a stimulant but paradoxically it can calm 
hyperactive children many experts say 
casey began taking ritalin in the first grade when behavior 
problems surfaced and continued taking it before school and during 
the day for 18 months until the spring of last year 
off ritalin casey has gained weight sleeps better and looks 
healthier said his father michael but he still does not know 
right from wrong has a very short attention span and in general 
is a bright but very trying child jesson said 
on ritalin casey looked and acted like a drug addict with 
facial twitches pale skin little appetite and insomnia his 
parents said he would sit for hours in front of the television and 
rock back and forth his mother said 
late in the afternoon when the drug began to wear off he would 
begin to kick scream cry for hours remain awake until after 
midnight refuse to eat make repetitive animal noises and stare 
transfixed at the faces he would make in a mirror his parents said 
he was a child in the drivers seat said mrs jesson if 
we had a good day it was because casey let us have a good day he 
was full of rage and it demanded our constant attention 
the jessons rejected suggestions that they increase the amount 
of ritalin to keep casey medicated at night the stuff made him a 
zombie i couldnt do that to him said mrs jesson 
the alternative to ritalin is cylert which can cause an enzyme 
buildup in the liver and would require caseys blood to be checked 
periodically according to testimony from doctors who evaluated 
casey at childrens hospital in boston 
since taking casey off ritalin the jessons have experimented 
with their sons diet trying to see what food substances or 
additives affect his behavior some experts have linked 
hyperactivity to a childs diet 
we know he craves sugar and feels better when amounts of it 
are kept to the absolute minimum said mrs jesson 
the jessons have rejected the school districts proposal to put 
casey provided he goes back on medication in a program of 
counseling and behavior therapy 
his parents want the school district to offer casey a 
educational curriculum that includes counseling behavior 
modification and more focus on the needs of hyperactive children 
such as special dietary needs but no medication 
this kid had problems to begin with and then was blown apart 
by ritalin said mrs jesson this family is through with 
drugs we need answers without drugs

israeli troops tracked down arab guerrillas 
from lebanon and fought them in rocky terrain and scrub brush just 
inside israels northern border tuesday two soldiers and all three 
guerrillas were killed israel said 
two soldiers were wounded one seriously with a bullet wound in 
his chest in the bloodiest border clash since palestinian riots 
broke out in the israeli occupied territories to the south on dec 
8 
the military command said israel also deported six palestinian 
guerrillas on tuesday the army would not specify where the six 
were taken but neighboring lebanon was the most likely destination 
the army said the six were among 50 guerrillas of the palestine 
liberation organizations mainstream fatah branch captured on feb 
7 1987 the 50 were aboard the small cargo ship maria r which 
flew a honduran flag and was seized midway in its journey from 
larnaca cyprus to lebanon 
arab guerrillas captured by israel are usually sentenced to 
prison terms in israel the jewish state has expelled 20 
palestinians from the occupied territories since the unrest started 
nearly five months ago 
in the gaza strip the army blocked hundreds of palestinians 
from reaching jobs in israel by confiscating their id cards and 
requiring them to undergo checks at government offices 
the government also temporarily revoked the press credentials of 
two foreign journalists martin fletcher of nbc news and glenn 
frankel of the washington post for failing to submit their 
dispatches to military censorship 
the border attack began before dawn when an israeli patrol 
discovered footprints northeast of the town of kiriyat shimona an 
army spokesman said 
for hours troops lit the skies with flares and searched for the 
intruders the spokesman said 
the soldiers found the guerrillas about 200 yards inside the 
border and fired 
the guerrillas responded by hurling hand grenades and firing a 
rocket the spokesman said 
lebanese police said earlier that the attack occurred in 
lebanese territory near kfar shouba but a syrianbacked group that 
participated in the firefight later said it occurred in israel 
a soldier involved in the clash said troops and guerrillas were 
six feet away from each other when the fighting began 
they were hiding on a deep slope inside a maze of trees the 
soldier who would not give his name told israel radio it was 
not possible to see them from inside the maze the terrorists 
opened fire 
the army identified the dead soldiers as lt col shmuel adiv 
29 a battalion commander of the elite givati infantry unit and 
sgt ramzi wahsh 27 a bedouin scout 
gen yossi peled head of northern command identified the 
guerrillas as palestinians and said their target was civilian 
settlements 
police spokesmen in beirut said it was a sevenman guerrilla 
ring belonging to two prosoviet groups the lebanese communist 
party and the popular front for the liberation of palestine led by 
george habash 
but israel said there were only three infiltrators and an 
israeli military official told israel radio that documents found on 
them showed they belonged to the syrianbacked democratic front for 
the liberation of palestine led by naif hawatme 
later tuesday hawatmes group said the attack occurred in 
israel and that 12 israeli soldiers were killed 
both the israeli army and lebanese police said two israeli 
soldiers and three guerrillas were killed 
in a communique hawatmes group said the attack was staged by 
martyr abu jihad wazir squad referring to the plo military 
commander assassinated in tunis april 16 apparently by israeli 
commandos 
the communique claimed the fighting lasted from daybreak to 
midafternoon and said heavy machine guns and grenades were used 
earlier a police spokesman said fighting broke out at 330 am 
and the fierce clash raged for about three hours 
the incident marked the 11th infiltration or attempted 
infiltration since nov 25 when a lone guerrilla landed a hang 
glider in northern israel and attacked a military base he killed 
six soldiers in a hail of grenades before being shot to death 
israeli officials have linked the attempts to the uprising in 
the territories according to un figures 173 palestinians and 
two israelis have died since dec 8 
in gaza christine dabagh a spokeswoman for the united nations 
relief and works agency said the army had taken the id cards of 
hundreds of gazans and had ordered them to report to three separate 
offices to check if they owed money for taxes 
the measures appeared aimed at breaking a tax boycott that has 
been a tactic of the palestinian uprising 
defense minister yitzhak rabin was quoted as telling 
parliaments foreign affairs and defense committee that fighting 
the uprising cost the army 2575 million to date

democratic leaders put the brakes on a major 
trade bill tuesday postponing a vote on final passage while they 
scrambled for enough republican support to override a threatened 
presidential veto 
provisions that would limit export of alaskan oil became a 
critical stumbling block as leaders campaigned to line up enough 
votes to make president reagan think twice before reaching for his 
veto pen 
senate majority leader robert c byrd dwva postponed until 
wednesday or possibly even thursday a vote on the 1000page bill 
reagan opposes because it would require all but the smallest 
employers to give notice of plantclosings and major layoffs 
the delay gave democratic leaders more time to beat the bushes 
for republican support 
reagan again signaled that he would veto the measure as it 
stands saying in a letter to senate minority leader bob dole 
rkan that lawmakers should finish the trade bill process in a 
way that serves americas interests not special interests 
the centerpiece of the bill would streamline the system under 
which the united states imposes import restrictions to retaliate 
against international trade violations and aid us industries 
threatened by stepped up foreign competition 
senate finance committee chairman lloyd bentsen dtexas said 
he was searching for ways to take care of complaints from alaskas 
senators that the bill was too restrictive of their states oil 
exports 
party leaders figured that democrats need 14 republican votes to 
demonstrate the twothirds support needed to override a veto 
bentsen did not tip his hand by offering a specific count he again 
said it was close 
both parties were bidding for support from alaskas republican 
senators ted stevens and frank murkowski who reported themselves 
incensed over the oil exports provision 
this legislation discriminates very violently against my 
state stevens told the senate it is a concept that i am 
unable to accept 
currently it is illegal to export any oil from the alaska oil 
pipeline but the state does export about 4000 barrels a day from 
cook inlet 
the trade bill would limit export of refined oil from a new 
installation at valdez to 70000 barrels a day and 50 percent of 
output the limit would apply statewide and thus act as a cap on 
any additional refineries built 
another provision would require that crude oil exports to canada 
of 50000 barrels a day envisioned under a pending trade pact would 
have to be transported first to some point in the lower 48 states 
presumably seattle before being sent back north of the border 
murkowski said it was unconstitutional to discriminate against 
one state in legislation applying to the entire country 
the crude oil provision had been sought by the maritime 
industry which currently transports the oil to west coast ports 
and would lose jobs if it were merely piped over the border to 
canada 
mark murray press secretary to rep don bonker dwash said 
bonker and other lawmakers had drawn the provision requiring 
shipment of crude to the lower 48 states before export to canada 
he said it merely echoed provisions already in the pending 
uscanada free trade agreement 
he said bonker supported the provision because he feared 
maritime unions would scuttle the free trade agreement without it 
and because he was concerned about dwindling employment in the west 
coast maritime industry 
its a tempest in a teapot he said he said criticism of 
the provision contained political overtones for bonker who is 
currently running for a senate seat against former gop sen slade 
gorton this has a lot to do with slade gorton murray said 
bonker later met with bentsen and murkowski and issued a 
statement afterward saying he believed it would be possible to 
reach a compromise he added i dont think anybody in the house 
or senate wants to scuttle the entire bill on a single issue like 
alaska oil 
the provision requiring a stopoff in a west coast port for 
alaska crude exports does appear in the us free trade agreement 
confirmed gary holmes a press aide to us trade representative 
clayton k yeutter he said it was placed in the pact at the urging 
of maritime interests 
sen phil gramm rtexas said he would vote against the bill 
he said the savings and loan industry in texas and numerous other 
industries would be crippled by the plantclosings provision 
he acknowledged a political risk in opposing the bill because it 
also calls for the repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil 
companies a move favored by the texas oil industry

bands of young people set fire to 
street barricades tuesday after police prevented them from holding 
antigovernment rallies in mixedrace townships near cape town 
a group of academic leaders held a news conference and issued a 
statement denouncing security force actions during more than a week 
of protests at township schools education cannot happen at 
gunpoint it said 
students in the townships are demanding the reinstatement of 
activist teachers dismissed by the government the release of 
youths detained during protests and boycotts and the lifting of 
restrictions on political meetings 
in at least three townships athlone mitchells plain and 
bonteheuwel police blocked planned protest meetings tuesday 
local reporters said 
several journalists were questioned by officers and ordered out 
of the area under stateofemergency regulations 
there were unconfirmed reports that up to 20 youths were 
detained 
last week police sent letters to school principals saying 
officers would be deployed on school grounds to enforce order if 
disruptions continued some principals said they would close the 
schools rather than allow security forces on the premises 
at the news conference student leaders teachers and university 
administrators accused security forces of provocative actions 
the security forces are effectively threatening to occupy 
schools in the name of law and order their statement said the 
response of the authorities is a recipe for chaos and 
confrontation 
among those signing the statement were stuart saunders chief 
administrator of the predominantly white university of cape town 
and jakes gerwel administrator of the mainly mixedrace university 
of the western cape 
in other developments 
the weekly mail an antiapartheid publication received a 
warning from home affairs minister stoffel botha that it could soon 
be closed for publishing material he considers subversive 
irwin manoim the newspapers copublisher said the warning 
meant botha could act within three weeks to install an inhouse 
censor or close the paper for three months 
the new nation another antiapartheid newspaper has been 
closed for three months and several other publications have 
received warnings from botha he has censorship authority under the 
state of emergency imposed by the whitecontrolled government 
civil rights workers said the government has declared the 
black township of oukasie an emergency camp the government is 
trying to relocate the townships residents and thousands are 
refusing to move 
the civil rights workers of the transvaal rural action committee 
said the emergencycamp designation meant that oukasie near the 
northeastern city of brits was no longer governed by regular 
municipal laws and could be abolished 
about 5000 oukasie residents have complied with government 
directions and moved to an area 15 miles away but 8000 have 
defied the government and refused to leave 
opponents of the relocation said the government wants to 
demolish oukasie because of complaints from white residents in 
brits who say the township is too close to their neighborhoods 
by law and custom apartheid establishes a racially segregated 
society in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services 
south africas racial classifications include whites blacks

a pregnant woman who suspects that the 
father of her unborn child may have aids has been allowed to see 
the mans medical records under a court order 
alison tradup 25 demanded the information in a suit she filed 
here so she could decide whether to abort the 9weekold fetus on 
april 22 monroe circuit judge ignatius lester ordered the records 
turned over to her 
state health and rehabilitative services officials complied 
monday in a closed hearing under the judges order ms tradup 
cannot reveal the contents of the records her lawyer said ms 
tradup had made her decision but would not reveal what it was 
the suit names james mayer coowner of the key west landmark 
sloppy joes bar as the defendant mayer was hospitalized recently 
with an undisclosed illness and his wife died earlier this month 
of causes that have been kept confidential by county officials 
the suit said mayer is reputed in the community to have the 
aids virus but has denied this to ms tradup and refuses to give 
her access to his medical records 
ms tradups attorney imogene synon said she was pleased with 
the result of the court action but wished mayer had complied 
voluntarily 
she said ms tradups own aids test was negative and that an 
aids test conducted on mayer several weeks ago was negative 
however ms synon said ms tradup wanted to examine further 
medical information 
mayers attorney michael halpern said his client had no 
objection to ms tradups access to the records but he felt 
compelled to defend the confidentiality of aids data 
my client recognized that anybody who was tested for aids 
would be faced with the same situation he was faced with halpern 
said the potential abuse is horrifying that his records could 
turn up on the streets 
but halpern called lesters decision a perfect balancing of 
the plaintiffs right to know while protecting the defendants 
confidentiality

for failing to prevent a commuter bus hijacking in which three 
israeli nuclear workers were killed by palestinian guerrillas last 
month 
mordechai virshubsky a legislator from the leftwing citizens 
rights movement said the march 7 hijacking could have been 
prevented and charged police with trying to conceal mistakes 
details of the police actions emerged after military censors

in a security affair 
a threeman guerrilla squad that infiltrated from egypt killed 
three israelis and wounded nine before being shot dead by a special 
antiterrorist police unit that stormed the bus in the southern 
negev desert 
the guerrillas seized a military renault4 vehicle before

israeli policemen who were ordered to erect a roadblock on the 
highway linking dimona with the negevs capital of beersheva and 
stop the renault4 
it said one policeman fired at the guerrillas car but missed a 
second policeman tried to fire but his uzi submachine gun jammed 
the third police officer did not fire at all because he was busy 
erecting the roadblock the radio said adding that the guerrillas 
passed through the barrier unharmed 
at first they wanted to conceal all this from the public they 
made every effort so that it does not reach public knowledge 
virshubsky told the radio 
ran cohen a legislator of virshubskys movement told army 
radio the incident was not a catastrophe but it was a 
serious failure 
israel radio quoted police officials as saying the affair was 
blown up and a simple technical breakdown presented as failure

an m14 rifle to every police patrol and check all weapons in the 
police arsenal 
police commissioner david krauss told israel radio the police 
had learned a lesson and no one should be put on trial

president daniel ortega said tuesday 
that president reagans decision to extend the us economic 
embargo against nicaragua reflected a criminal attitude 
the embargo will not demoralize the nicaraguan workers 
ortega told a group of laborers who are working to develop 26 wells 
to improve the managua areas water supply 
our response to the embargo is this production of more water 
for the population of managua ortega said 
here we have the results the morality and conscience of the 
workers is stronger than the criminal attitude of reagan with all 
his embargos 
ortega said reagans statement that nicaragua represented a 
security threat to the united states was a ridiculous thing 
reagan has done this to justify his terrorist and aggressive 
policy against the nicaraguan people and workers he added 
in a statement sent to congress on monday reagan said the 
actions and policies of the government of nicaragua continue to 
pose an unusual and extroardinary threat to the national security 
and foreign policy of the united states 
the embargo would have expired may 1 reagan first ordered the 
embargo in may 1985 cutting off all trade with the central 
american country and denying nicaraguan airliners and flag vessels 
access to the united states 
the united states maintains diplomatic relations with 
nicaraguas leftist government but also has provided aid to rebels 
fighting to overthrow ortegas sandinista government 
on march 23 the rebels known as contras and sandinistas agreed 
to a 60day ceasefire that went into effect april 1 under the 
agreement the two sides are to negotiate a permanent truce they 
have held meetings this month in managua

the soviet government said tuesday the united 
states and pakistan would face international moral condemnation if 
they violated the geneva agreement on the civil war in aghanistan 
it also urged pakistan to shut down afghan guerrilla bases 
inside that country 
an official statement carried by the tass news agency said 
politicians and officials who it did not identify began making 
statements contradicting the letter and the spirit of the geneva 
accords immediately after they were signed april 14 
any deviation from the recorded accords can harm the cause of 
the afghan settlement and impair the moral prestige of a state that 
breaks the obligation assumed before the whole world it said 
the united states pakistan the soviet union and afghanistan 
signed the agreement but afghan rebel leaders did not 
the statement carried by tass said the soviet union will keep 
its part of the agreement and will withdraw its soldiers from 
afghanistan about 115000 soviet military personnel are thought to 
be in the country 
their withdrawal will begin on may 15 1988 and be completed 
not later than feb 15 1989 it said our country is waiting 
for its sons who have helped a friendly neighboring nation that has 
found itself in trouble 
the soviet people will never forget their exploits and will 
hold sacred the memory of those who have laid down their lives on 
afghan soil it added 
soviet troops entered afghanistan in december 1979 to help the 
marxist government fight the anticommunist guerrillas 
the statement denounced the rebels saying their rejection of 
the geneva accords only shows that the sense of responsibility 
for the destinies of their country and their people is lacking

officials have decided it is safe to cultivate 
about 74000 acres of land near the chernobyl plant back two years 
after the worlds worst nuclear power accident tass said tuesday 
the soviet news agency said in a report from chernobyl that 
radiation levels around the power plant in the soviet ukraine are 
well within internationally accepted norms 
in a separate report soviet television showed film of a 
memorial gathering of relatives of those killed in the explosion 
and fire at the plants no 4 reactor on april 26 1986 
at least 31 people were killed by the blast and the release of 
radiation and a cloud of radiactive material circled the earth 
alexei denisenko deputy chairman of the ukraine state 
agroindustrial committee told tass the land to be brought back 
into cultivation lies within the 18mile zone around the plant that 
was evacuated after the accident 
it said scientists are working in pripyat the former home of 
49000 people located three miles from the plant to see if any 
longterm damage was done to plant life 
so far we have not detected any mutations or changes in the 
chromosome systems of plants said laboratory director nikolai 
arkhipov the research shows that the level of its contamination 
with radionuclides does not exceed the international medical norm 
for foodstuffs 
tass said the radiation level near the plants first reactor is 
about 05 milliroentgen an hour and about four milliroentgen near 
the second reactor 
a milliroentgen is onethousandth of a roentgen the standard 
measure of ionizing radiation experts say exposure to 50 roentgens 
or more per year is dangerous and 400 roentgens per year can be 
fatal 
the news agency said a power plant worker would have to stay on 
the site for 50 years to receive the dosage of radiation considered 
the maximum allowable by international standards 
soviet news media generally have given a positive picture of 
work at the chernobyl plant in a series of reports dedicated to the 
anniversary of the accident 
but on sunday the communist party newspaper pravda blasted 
sloppy repairs drunkenness and nepotism at the plant it said 
managers there act as though there hasnt been an accident

sailors boarded the disabled submarine uss 
bonefish drifting off the florida coast tuesday and began testing 
and pumping out what they said appeared to be toxic gases inside a 
navy spokesman said 
earlier tuesday 19 of the 22 sailors injured in sundays 
explosions and fire were discharged from a hospital in 
jacksonville fla 
the fiveman boarding crew planned to continue its work 
throughout the night before any effort was made to enter the 
submarine said lt fred henney a spokesman for the atlantic fleet 
in norfolk 
initial reports indicate the air contained high concentrations 
of toxic gases henney said he said he could not identify the 
gas 
theyre pumping air through the ship to get the toxic gases to 
leave he said 
the boarding crew did not enter the sub and had no report of the 
condition inside the vessel and nothing further on the three 
missing sailors 
the bonefish was submerged when the explosions and fire began 
sunday during a training exercise the crew was able to get it to 
the surface and the skipper ordered it evacuated because of heavy 
smoke and toxic fumes 
the frigate uss carr and the aircraft carrier john f kennedy 
both of which were on routine exercises with the bonefish 
evacuated 89 of the 92 crew members 
it was a very harrowing experience we went through out there 
cmdr mike wilson skipper of the bonefish said on arriving in 
charleston sc by plane with other injured sailors from the 
jacksonville hospital tuesday 
the acts of individual heroism by members of the crew of 
getting people off that ship are just too numerous to mention 
wilson said the crews behavior speaks highly of the training 
they went through and it was just phenomenal 
lt cmdr john tull public affairs officer at the charleston 
naval base said tuesday night that wilson would have no further 
comment because of the pending investigation of the incident 
earlier tuesday navy salvage crews briefly boarded the bonefish 
to close an open hatch and prevent water from getting in the 
vessel but high winds and rough seas prevented them from beginning 
testing 
with winds of 21 knots seas were running 6 to 8 feet and 
washing over the deck henney said 
the decision was to close the hatch to eliminate the chance of 
water getting in henney said 
a civilian submarine expert said the explosions and fire that 
disabled the dieselelectric submarine were typical of such 
prenuclear subs 
its the classic way the dieselelectric submarines go down 
the tubes in peacetime norman friedman author of submarine 
design and development said in a telephone interview from his 
new york city home 
in washington adm carlisle ah trost chief of naval 
operations and a former submariner said the missing men may have 
died at their posts 
all three of those individuals were on watch in the ships 
control room and were last seen there trost said so it may 
well be that they simply ensured that everyone got clear and they 
themselves didnt make it 
friedman said the 30yearold bonefish one of the navys last 
remaining dieselelectric subs was probably filled with toxic 
chlorine gas released by fire in the forward battery compartment 
dieselelectric subs use diesel engines to turn the propeller 
while cruising on the surface and to charge the batteries needed to 
run electric motors that move the boat while submerged 
the typical accident happens when hydrogen builds up in the 
battery compartments while the sub is charging the batteries 
friedman said a spark ignites the hydrogen and remember the 
ship is full of electric motors and you have an explosion 
followed by a fire and that fire produces the chlorine gas 
the navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosions 
and fire but confirmed a newspaper report that the first explosion 
occurred while the ship was cruising at periscope depth 
the virginianpilot in norfolk said the boat may have been 
charging its batteries by using its snorkel to pull in fresh air to 
run the diesels while running within 50 feet of the surface 
according to friedman the last american dieselelectric sub 
lost because of battery explosion was the uss cochino which went 
down near norway on aug 26 1949 the crew was rescued 
the frigate uss mccloy was on station with the abandoned 
bonefish and the uss petrel arrived monday with salvage crews from 
charleston the submarines home port 
the salvage ship uss hoist from the little creek amphibious base 
in norfolk arrived on the scene tuesday henney said the hoist is 
designed for towing disabled warships he said 
of the 22 crew members injured only two were expected to 
require extended further treatment for smoke inhalation at the 
naval hospital in jacksonville fla 
ltjg edmund b collins 34 of forest park ill and petty 
officer 1st class antone silvia 28 of fort lauderdale fla were 
in serious but stable condition and improving henney said 
robert silvia said navy officials told him his son and collins 
were the last ones down in the engine room trying to get everyone 
out 
petty officer 1st class charless e evans 29 of madison 
tenn was listed in satisfactory condition and was being kept for 
another day according to hospital spokesman nick young 
the other 19 were discharged tuesday to return to charleston 
said lt cmdr john griffin 
the missing sailors were identified as lt ray everts 30 of 
naoma wva petty officer 1st class robert w bordelon jr 39 
of willis texas and petty officer 3rd class marshall t lindgren

un officials are putting the finishing touches 
on a return program for more than 5 million afghan refugees 
potentially one of the biggest united nations operations ever 
the prospect of continued civil war in afghanistan makes a swift 
refugee return seem unlikely but the world body is preparing for 
several possibilities envoys of the office of the un high 
commissioner for refugees have begun talks on repatriation with the 
governments of the three countries involved afghanistan pakistan 
and iran 
carrol faubert head of the afghan repatriation unit at unhcr 
said plans for returning the refugees are almost final and 
provisional of course because we dont know when how many and in 
what time frame people will move 
were trying to be ready for quick action if there is more 
rapid movement than some expect he added 
also the refugee situation differs in pakistan and in iran two 
border nations harboring the displaced afghans 
officials of various un agencies will meet in new york 
thursday to distribute tasks in the repatriation said unhcr 
sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity un 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is expected to appoint a 
special program coordinator shortly as was done during the african 
drought emergency 
perez de cuellar told a news conference tuesday that un 
observers will soon be deployed to monitor withdrawal of soviet 
troops from afghanistan and a political settlement he said the 
security council authorized him to proceed with the un mission 
our operation will be very much on in the next few days he 
said 
faubert said in an interview with the associated press that 
unhcr intends to supervise protection for the returnees organize 
transportation back to their place of origin and oversee the 
initial distribution of food seeds and agricultural tools after 
they return a communications network to monitor the different 
parts of the program must also be built 
the effort is expected to cost hundreds of millions of dollars 
if all afghans return un refugee commissioner jeanpierre hocke 
has said 
perez de cuellar is expected to launch an appeal for money soon 
our people are drawing up a number of scenarios that go from a 
massive rush to people not moving very quickly in pakistan there 
are about 20 different scenarios faubert said 
he said it is also difficult to predict whether the refugees 
will return to several areas simultaneously or move region by 
region 
apart from logistics un officials are evaluating what aid is 
needed to rebuild roads and dwellings and restore land in 
afghanistan 
more than a third of the population fled during 10 years of 
civil war official figures list 31 million afghan refugees in 
pakistan and 24 million in iran 
under a unsponsored agreement signed april 14 the soviet 
union pledged to withdraw its troops backing the afghan government 
starting may 15 afghanistan and pakistan agreed to ensure the safe 
and voluntary return of refugees 
not signing were moslem afghan guerrillas who say they will 
continue fighting to overthrow the communist kabul government 
unhcr officials in pakistan met with the resistance shortly 
before the pacts conclusion apparently aiming to draw them into 
the repatriation plans faubert refused to reveal the outcome of 
the talks but said they will continue 
un plans must also take into account the differences between 
government policy and the composition of the refugee population in 
iran and pakistan 
most afghans in pakistan are displaced farmers housed in 320 
refugee villages within about 60 miles of the border they own 
about 4000 private trucks so there could be sizeable 
unsupervised returns 
in iran about 60 percent of the afghan refugees are in cities 
relatively far from the border many are said to have found menial 
jobs they may wait for years to return faubert said 
iran which did not take part in the un negotiations and 
pakistan both pledge not to expel refugees but pakistani officials 
make clear they would welcome a quick return home of the afghans 
many pakistanis blame the refugees for a wide range of the 
countrys social and economic problems

from the east bloc and the west they said the soviets questioned 
the participation of denmark ireland and canada and sought greater 
representation from communist countries 
perez de cuellar was asked how a small observer team of 40 to 50 
men in the two capitals could successfully monitor the mass 
movement of men and refugees without passports across a 1400mile 
border 
they will do their best but they cannot go beyond their 
mandate he said referring to the agreement that specifies small 
units in the capitals of afghanistan and pakistan 
in 1960 the united nations sent 20000 peacekeepers to the 
congo when belgian troops withdrew and bloody conflicts ensued 
perez de cuellar was asked if a small team could keep peace in 
afghanistan where many experts predict much bloodshed factional 
fighting among afghan guerrilla groups and attacks on the afghan 
government 
we will take decisions i can assure you that we will face 
it if we have the necessary support of the security council and 
member countries he said we have experience but we do not 
want to cross that bridge until we get to it 
perez de cuellar said cordovez and his team will see if 
something is going to happen but it deployment of a larger 
un force would be decided by the security council because we 
cannot send troops into such a situation without approval

michael dukakis said his triumph in tuesdays 
pennsylvania primary was a very big boost toward the dmeocratic 
presidential nomination but the massachusets governor refused to 
say he has won the battle 
im going to campaign as hard as i can in the primaries 
between now and june 7 dukakis told reporters im gong to 
campaign in every single primary 
dukakis said he was particularly pleased to win another big 
state his fourth in a row in such a convincing fashion racking 
up a better than 21 margin over remaining rival jesse jackson 
its a very big boostparticuarly in a state that has been 
a bellwether state in the general election dukakis added its 
going to be very helpful 
asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his dukakis 
refused to claim the crown yet refering to democratic nominee 
walter mondales probelms in 1984 
i reminded you several time that fritz mondale won new york 
and pennsylvania and then lost a string of primaries he said 
he said he would not change his campaign themes or strategy 
im going to keep it as strong and positive as i possibly 
can dukakis said 
the next round of contests comes next tuesday in ohio indiana 
and the district of columbia dukakis was heading for ohio on 
thursday 
earlier dukakis said vice president george bush has 
flipflopped on his pledge not to raise taxes bush won the 
republican primary in pennsylvania and the contest was expected to 
yield enough delegates to give him a mathematical lock on the 
nomination 
dukakis bringing up the politically risky tax issue said 
bushs pledge was a shaky one like the claim by a comic opera 
character that he never gets seasick what never hardly ever 
in recent days dukakis has been referring to bush his possible 
november opponent in answer to questions 
asked whether he would raise taxes dukakis gave his standard 
answer 
weve got to find new revenue i dont think any responsible 
candidate for the presidency can rule out new taxes i cant make 
that judgment at the present time 
then he added 
even the vice president found that out he announced on 
saturday promising no new taxes and then kind of like the captain 
of the pinafore on monday he said well hardly ever dukakis 
told the luncheon crowd 
dukakis was referring a line from the gilbert and sullivan 
musical hms pinafore in the musical the ship captain takes 
part in this famous dialogue 
and im never never sick at sea 
what never 
no never 
what never 
hardly ever 
when bush announced his campaign for the 1988 gop nomination in 
october 1987 he said i am not going to raise your taxes 
period 
but two days later bush said in an interview on the cable news 
network that he might 
what i have said is if i were convinced that all the spending 
that could possibly be constrained or cut had taken place then and 
only then would i consider a tax increase he said 
dukakis has been talking on the campaign trail about the giant 
federal deficit and what he calls the fiscal mess the next 
president will inherit from the reagan administration and this 
mess exists even with recent tax increases he said 
the current administration has raised taxes three or four 
times in six years he said

at one point in abcs the richest man in the 
world the story of aristotle onassis winston churchill asks ari 
how he thinks history will remember him 
onassis demurs but he could have predicted that he would be 
immortalized in lame exploitative madefortv movies to run in 
sweeps months on american networks this latest airs sunday and 
monday 
what starts as inconsequential pulp basically stays that way 
although when raul julia takes over the title role late in the 
first half it threatens to become an interesting character study 
of a powerful man who knew exactly what he wanted and just couldnt 
quite get it 
this is a sympathetic portrait of onassis as well as maria 
callas played by jane seymour jackie francesca annis and the 
rest of the kennedy clan come off as a bunch of moneygrubbing ugly 
americans 
the movie based on the bestselling biography ari by peter 
evans isnt the first tv treatment of the greek shipping magnates 
life 
anthony quinn portrayed a character obviously based on onassis 
in the tv movie the greek tycoon several years ago this time 
he plays onassis father a thankless role that has him alternately 
fuming and spouting fortunecookie proverbs quinns son lorenzo 
incidentally plays onassis son alexander 
elias koteas is adequate as the young ari though his role lasts 
too long and he doesnt in the least resemble julia whose droopy 
eyelids and languid sensuality are perfect for playing onassis who 
in real life wasnt exactly a matinee idol 
the movie begins with onassis as a youth in turkey where his 
father was a tobacco dealer when the turks begin rounding up 
greeks attractive young aristo avoids being sent to a labor camp 
by having an affair with a turkish colonel no doubt with the words 
of his father a wise man does what is necessary ringing in 
his ears 
but his father doesnt appreciate the way aristo has won the 
familys freedom so ari moves to argentina where he sells 
cigarettes and begins a habit of seducing opera stars 
julia shows up as ari at 46 when he marries tina beatie 
edney the 17yearold daughter of a shipping competitor anthony 
zerbe 
now the luscious trashiness begins in earnest 
after having two children tina who may be young but is not 
stupid notices her husbands philandering and leaves 
ari continues his pursuit of the volatile callas while wining 
and dining jetsetters like lee radziwill and the powerful of the 
world including churchill through lee he meets her sister the 
delicate wife of an upandcoming us senator the short stocky 
onassis probably would have been delighted at a yacht scene in 
which julia towers over the actor playing john f kennedy annis 
plays jackie as a symbol of respect devoid of personality 
after kennedy is assassinated jackie desperate for protection 
figures onassis and his millions can provide it 
instead of marrying the triedandtrue callas onassis opts for 
symbolic triumph by wedding the worlds most revered woman his 
children care for no one but their real mother and contemptuously 
refer to her as the widow 
jackie begins a spending spree that could put even onassis in 
the poorhouse and she becomes enraged when photographers with 
scuba equipment and long lenses are able to photograph her topless 
onassis goes back once again to callas he also repairs a 
strained relationship with his son but alexander dies in a plane 
crash devastating onassis 
shortly before he falls into ill health onassis bequeaths to 
his daughter christina harriet bagnell his business secrets 
such as write down everything especially about people when you 
meet them again youll know how much time theyre worth 
too late for viewers who will have already wasted almost four 
hours on the miniseries

every day since the stock market crash a 
halfyear ago an economic crisis of one sort or another has been 
forecast in trade credit stocks bonds car sales and more 
oddly and offering a flash of insight about our times none of 
the crises has arrived they fade quietly no apologies from 
their creators and are replaced by vitally fresh hairraisers 
are mortgage rates headed higher will the federal reserve clamp 
down on the money supply can the dollar be saved 
economically speaking the six months since the great stock 
market crash have been unusually calm the economy has neither 
boomed nor busted the jobless rate has trended lower securites 
have been fairly stable 
it has not been that way in the forecasts had they been right 
securities would be deeply depressed unemployment would have 
soared home mortgages would have been unattainable plants and 
factories would be shutting down 
in short the economy as forecast would be in ruins 
while forecasters suggest it is a miracle their worst estimates 
havent come true it is equally amazing to others that some 
forecasters wont give up in almost every economic forecast there 
remains a sense of punishment due good economic news is seldom 
accepted for what it is instead it provokes forecasts of worse to 
come poor economic news is almost welcomed 
the contrast between forecast and performance is especially 
obvious in the stock market where it has become axiomatic that a 
pervading bearishness in the forecasts indicates of all things a 
higher market to come 
whatever the reasons the persistent sense of fear in the 
forecasts has created the impression that the past six months have 
been ones of turmoil whereas they have been closer to tranquillity 
why then do the fears linger 
a sense of guilt perhaps if the stock market crashed why 
shouldnt a recession follow recessions almost always follow so 
why not now 
a recognition that deep and largely unresolved problems remain 
the trade and budget deficits third world loans a high level of 
credit at every level of the economy the threat of trade wars the 
volatility of markets 
but that doesnt fully explain why the good news is discounted 
the economy for example has been neither strong nor weak and 
either one could cause trouble inflation in one instance 
recession in the other jobs are being created inflation remains 
in check interest rates though edging higher havent been 
jumping around as they once did exports are improving 
eventually there will be a recession because if there is one 
clearly demonstrable trait of economies is that they run in cycles 
sooner or later expansions get out of hand inflation begins 
recession ensues 
while recession is viewed as an event to avoid it can be argued 
that it is necessary for clearing the way for the next expansion 
but to view it that way might be more than the human mind can 
accept 
no less acceptable however than the reign of terror in the 
forecasts of things to come that destroy the calm of the present

the sound can still be heard in the city 
four or five voices working on a street corner in a resonant 
subway tunnel maybe up on the roof 
doowop crested 25 or 30 years ago with hits such as earth 
angel under the boardwalk and philadelphias own silhouettes 
singing get a job but its never gone away 
in the early 60s this music was disappearing as a trend but 
for the past four or five years its coming back as an underground 
situation said stan weaver tenor with the zip codes 
the hopping and bobbing doowop sound now turns up in 
commercials for mcdonalds kentucky fried chicken and levis blue 
jeans but philadelphias street corners can still attract some 
harmony on a warm evening with a group of guys with nothing but a 
pitch pipe to get started on the right key 
doowop was city music new york philadelphia los angeles 
and thats where it survives 
in philadelphia charlie horners rhythm and blues show on 
wxpnfm keeps the flame alive about 30 singers who couldnt 
afford instruments as teenagers and dont want them now were in 
the studio recently to help horner celebrate his 13th year on the 
air 
horner travels 75 miles from his albumpacked home in south 
bound brook nj to west philadelphia to spin the sides every 
saturday afternoon 
its like having a a second job but a good portion of my 
paycheck goes into records said horner a chemist 
with tens of thousands of records stacked on the floor couch 
and tables of his new jersey apartment horner has plenty of tunes 
from which to choose 
and with a man who spends every spare moment and all his spare 
change on this music dont call them oldies or nostalgia theyre 
terms that make horner wince to him these songs arent locked in 
the past or symbols of a lost era 
the type of music we play on the air is mostly from the 50s 
but thats just an accident of time he said 
horner started in college as a deejay on drexel universitys 
studentrun radio station then moved on to wxpn 
he hasnt found any reason to leave a microphone that puts him 
at the center of doowop singers and fans in philadelphia 
during his radio show horner fields telephone calls from 
singers who recorded the 30 or 35yearold records he plays 
occassionaly he finds himself as the middleman in a reunion 
the keystoners credit horner with bringing the group back together 
after 25 years of estrangement five years ago they sang in public 
for the first time since 1958 and are back recording hoping to 
relive the success of their regional hit magic kiss 
most singers though realize doowop stands little chance of 
ever being more than a hobby for them 
you have to love to sing because youre not going to get rich 
off it horner said 
were looking forward to something very serious said harold 
shipman baritone with choice a group that traveled from northern 
new jersey to sing live on horners show during the anniversary 
special 
while doowop bears the imprint of church choirs and of mellow 
quartets such as the mills brothers horton says the specific 
doowop sound can be traced to sonny til and the orioles whose 
1948 hit its too soon to know inspired black teenagers to 
sing on the street corners horner said 
he was to blacks what frank sinatra was to whites at the 
time horner said 
tils group was among the first to use a wordless falsetto with 
other parts singing nonsensical syllables to round out the chord 
doowop legend has it that the ravens bass singer jimmy ricks 
mistakenly started singing his part a few notes early one night 
drawing a gleeful and raucous response from the crowd at the apollo 
theater in harlem the doowop bass lead was born with ricks 
singing lead the group scored a hit with old man river 
the orioles 1949 hit dont tell me so reached no 1 on 
the rhythm and blues charts while crying in the chapel hit no 
11 on the pop charts making it one of the first rampb songs to cross 
over into the white market 
for black kids it was something they heard all their lives 
it was white america that suddenly turned on to it in the 
mid50s horner said 
horner isnt sure when it happened but at some point he turned 
from a fan to a historian of vocal harmony 
with karen caplan he is working on a book about the delta 
rhythm boys whose style was more an extension of jazz than rhythm 
and blues the delta rhythm boys went to finland in 1960 when their 
popularity in this country waned 
the sad thing is a lot of forms of american music while they 
have diehard fans need mass appeal its unfortunate a lot of 
black musicians have to go to europe he said 
lee gains of the delta rhythm boys probably one of the best 
bass singers in the history of the planet in horners estimation 
died july 15 1987 seven days later while singing a spiritual at 
the funeral hugh bryant suffered a fatal heart attack 
with two members of the group dead horner is more determined to 
chronicle the music and its influences 
people may not appreciate it the music now but might in 
2050 and wont know anything about it im trying to preserve the 
history of this music before its lost horner said

officials say the postponement in giving the 
1988 templeton prize for progress in religion to moslem leader 
inamullah khan was at his request after some jewish leaders accused 
him of antisemitism 
he himself asked for the delay so assurances could be given 
that the charges were not valid says the rev wilbert forker of 
nassau the bahamas vice president of the templeton foundation 
board members are now looking into it in this country and 
abroad he said the postponment was ordered april 5 and the 
inquiry was not likely to be concluded until midsummer 
charges that khan was antisemitic came after he was named in 
march to receive the 390000 prize for advancing cooperation among 
moslems christians and jews 
it had been scheduled for presentation may 10 in london 
khan 73 of karachi pakistan secretarygeneral of the world 
moslem congress said in a letter to the prize office 
i request that the prize ceremony be delayed if necessary for 
several months to allow full assurances to be given to the 
templeton judges and the public to clear away untruthful 
accusations and misunderstandings 
the criticisms were raised by the antidefamation league of 
bnai brith which alleged past antijewish comments by moslem 
congress officers and in its newsletter 
khan says the allegation that the world moslem congress ever 
issued or mailed from its office any antisemitic literature is a 
palpable falsehood 
he also said in a lengthy memorandum answering questions 
relayed to him by the new york times 
i can never support antisemitic feelings because i am myself 
a decendant of semitic ancestors from the middle easti respect 
jews as people of the book i respect moses as a prophet of god 
however mentioning a point that outrages jews the united 
nations classifying of zionism jewish nationalism as racism 
khan added 
my difference is with the zionists because the un general 
assembly has declared zionism a racist creed 
he also said the common arab description of israel as the 
zionist entity has no significance jews however 
overwhelmingly resent it 
noting that he is a president of the interfaith world conference 
of religion and peace he said i have consistently preached 
interreligious concord and understanding and promoted interfaith 
meetings 
william p thompson associate general secretary of the 
interfaith conference observed of the controversy 
the prize is not because the winner is a saint but because he 
has made some religious progress khan has made some remarkable 
strides toward greater openness to other religions and respect for 
them 
khan had been accused by abraham h foxman national director of 
the adl of denying israels right to exist however khan said he 
backs un resolution 242 which supports a secure israel and also 
palestinian statehood 
the new york times said a congress newsletter in the 1970s 
advertised the protocols of the elders of zion a antijewish 
forgery and carried other antijewish tracts not mentioned in 
questions to khan 
foxman said khan may have changed somewhat but not 
sufficiently to set him up as a model of interreligious 
understanding and reconciliation 
particularly criticizing khans reference to zionism as racism 
foxman said it reflects a mindset that hasnt changed that 
much 
jane evans a jewish leader acquainted with khan through the 
interfaith conference said he has kept open paths of 
communication with other religions 
but she said he also has shown what jews see as strongly 
antisemitic views by disparaging zionism as distinct from 
judaism 
he reflects a very difficult mixture of right and wrong 
added ms evans executive director emeritus of the national 
federation of temple sisterhoods 
much of the criticism of khan involved alleged congress 
newsletter items a decade or more ago but foxman also cited a 
june l986 item about a dinner khan hosted for chicago black 
moslem leader louis farrakhan 
farrakhan has called judaism a dirty religion 
foxman also criticized khan for a 1985 letter of appreciation to 
the spotlight a washington dc newsletter of the liberty lobby 
which foxman describes as virulently antijewish 
khan said his innocuous letter mentioned no religion 
john taylor of geneva switzerland general secretary of the 
world conference on religion and peace said the letter was merely 
a courteous response to solicited comment 
almost identical letters were written by jewish personalities 
before knowing the antisemitic qualities of the publication 
taylor said in a telephone interview 
most of the accusations against khan do not reflect personally 
on him but on the distant history of organizations and othershe 
distances himself from these institutional aberrations 
khan has stuck his neck out in some very unfriendly climate to 
build bridges of dialogue with jews christians hindus and others 
he has risked unpopularity in his own circles to do it

lurking among the canvases of langorous 
polynesian nudes in the national gallery of arts new exhibition of 
the works of paul gauguin is a curious surprise a wood carving 
that tells much about the enigmatic french artist 
it is an elaborate door frame that gaugin sculpted from redwood 
to decorate the entrance to the house of pleasure his 
primitive hut on the remote marquesan island of hivaoa in the south 
seas where he spent the last three years of his life 
carved on both sides of the base amid a tangle of nude figures 
tropical fruits animals and leafy garlands are the two simple 
commandments that seemed to frame gauguins own scandalous life 
inscribed in french one reads be amorous and you will be 
happy the other is be mysterious 
they were obeyed with joyous abandon by gauguin who renounced 
his family and his prosperous career as a paris stockbroker to 
pursue an artistic vision that led him to denmark brittany 
panama martinique tahiti and finally the marquesas islands 
where he died in 1903 at the age of 55 
the art of gauguin as the postimpressionist master and the 
legend of gauguin as the freespirited libertine are inseparable in 
the national gallerys latest blockbuster the first major 
exhibition of gauguins works in nearly 30 years and the most 
comprehensive ever held 
the show which took five years to assemble opened sunday for a 
threemonth engagement before traveling to the art institute of 
chicago where it will be on view from sept 17 through dec 11 
and the grand palais in paris jan 10 through april 20 next year 
admission at the national gallery is free but passes are 
required in anticipation of heavy crowds the exhibition is 
underwritten by american telephone amp telegraph co in the united 
states and by olivetti in paris 
the curators focused on the depth and range of gauguins art 
rather than the romantic mythology surrounding his remarkable 
personal life gauguins abstract images flattened sense of space 
and daring use of color which he called a profound mysterious 
language a language of the dream clearly inspired picasso 
matisse and other 20th century modernists 
youll find gauguin to be a fabulous and satisfying artist and 
an enigmatic one said richard brettell director of the dallas 
museum of art and one of the principal curators of the exhibition 
the 243 objects in the show include paintings sculpture 
ceramics prints and drawings on loan from museums and private 
collections around the world from japan australia and south 
america to europe the middle east and the soviet union 
brettell said soviet authorities were wonderfully 
cooperative in lending 11 paintings from their countrys gauguin 
collection the most important in the world 
many of the drawing and pictures including the soviet entries 
from the hermitage museum at leningrad and the pushkin state museum 
of fine arts in moscow have never before been displayed in a major 
exhibition even in the slightly larger gauguin memorial show that 
his friends mounted in paris in 1906 
but brettell said two of gauguins largest and most highly 
prized paintings which the curators wanted desperately for the 
national gallery show will be absent because they are too fragile 
to travel 
both painted in tahiti in 1898 they are rupe rupe gathering 
fruit at the hermitage and where do we come from what are we 
where are we going which remains at the boston museum of fine 
arts 
a personal favorite of gallery director j carter brown is the 
siesta which is owned by american publisher walter h annenberg 
and has not been exhibited publicly for a quartercentury 
brettell and charles f stuckey curator of 20th century art at 
the art institute of chicago flew to tahiti to select two wood 
carvings by gauguin from a small museum bearing his name one was a 
bowl for eating poi a fruit paste the other was the missing 
section of the decorative door frame which is housed in the museum 
dorsay in paris 
from tahiti the two curators chartered a twoengine 
propellerdriven plane for a harrowing sevenhour flight through 
tropical storms at low altitudes across more than 900 miles of the 
south pacific to the marquesas bretell calls them the most 
remote islands on earth the end of civilization in the tropics 
there they found gauguins burial site on the outskirts of a 
village on hivaoa the artists final refuge from the civilizing 
influence of french bureaucrats and missionaries who had occupied 
his beloved tahiti 
gauguin it seems had carefully cultivated his popular image 
even to the grave the headstone he sculpted for himself was his 
poetic image of an ancient polynesian spirit called oviri 
which means savage

five generations of family operation will end 
when west pointpepperell inc and its partners complete their 
122 billion buyout of textile giant jp stevens amp co 
pepperell which made its bid in conjunction with ntc group 
announced monday that it would pay 6850 a share in cash for the 
company which has been run by stevens family members for 175 years 
the new york investment firm odyssey partners pepperells rival 
in the lengthy takeover contest will purchase 530 million in 
stevens assets from pepperell 
pepperell will keep most of stevens sheet and towel operations 
boosting its share of the home fashion textile market to 25 
percent analysts said but about 170 million of those operations 
will be sold to ntc subsidiary bibb co to satisfy government 
antitrust concerns 
we would like to have stevens bed and bath business but we 
were the ones who proposed what we would divest early on so its 
no surprise said pepperell chairman joseph l lanier 
odyssey will get the companys other operations including its 
carpet and industrial fabrics plants 
pepperell and odyssey went three rounds in a weekslong heated 
auction before announcing last week they would work together to 
draft a joint buyout proposal 
stevens initially rejected their 122 billion offer because of 
concerns about the tentative nature of odysseys financing 
however the terms were revised over the weekend to stevens 
satisfaction 
in the event that pepperell cannot complete its end of the deal 
odyssey has agreed to purchase stevens subject to financing 
odysseys outstanding 6850ashare tender offer has been extended 
to may 20 pepperells offer at the same price will expire may 6 
unless extended 
in trading monday on the new york stock exchange stevens rose 
25 cents to close at 6775 a share 
pepperells interest in stevens has centered exclusively on the 
companys sheet and towel operations which include 
stateoftheart manufacturing facilities as well as top designer 
brand names those operations account for 60 percent of stevens 
161 billion in annual sales 
stevens towel and sheet lines include the brand names ralph 
lauren laura ashley gloria vanderbilt perry ellis pierre cardin 
and givenchy among others pepperells brands include arrow 
martex lady pepperell and burberry 
should further antitrust concerns arise the ftc has six months 
to decide whether pepperell must sell off a sheeting mill a yarn 
plant certain designer licenses and a brand name 
new yorkbased stevens employs more than 23000 people mostly 
in the southeastern united states 
pepperells lanier said he did not anticipate any layoffs at the 
factory level but said few if any employees would be needed at 
the corporate level 
analysts agree that stevens factories are run efficiently and 
are producing at near capacity but that corporate employment is 
bloated 
many observers were puzzled by odysseys aggressive interest in 
stevens the greige goods or unfinished fabric operations 
odyssey will acquire are profitable with sales of about 235 
million last year 
but the carpeting and industrial fabrics business which had 
flat 1987 sales of 334 million competes against large lowcost 
producers in a cyclical industry analysts noted 
partner brian d young denied analysts contentions that odyssey 
would be forced to cut employees 
odysseys share includes 26 plants that employ over 9000 
workers with annual revenue topping 750 million pepperell will 
acquire 15 plants and bibb will get eight plants further details 
were not available 
stevens own senior management headed by chairman whitney 
stevens a fifthgeneration member of the founding family put the 
company in play earlier this year with a leveraged buyout offer 
insiders say management particularly whitney stevens is upset 
it will not play a role in the company after the takeover 
its not a happy day at stevens headquarters said one 
source close to the transaction 
meanwhile representatives of the south carolina and new york 
attorneys general met here monday to discuss their investigation 
into whether the three companies in combining their efforts to 
acquire stevens violated any antitrust laws in determining what 
price to pay

domestic auto sales rose slightly during 
midapril although among the biggest automakers only chrysler 
corp recorded car sales gains in the period 
sales of usmade cars and light trucks totaled 353314 from 
april 1120 up from 308240 a year earlier a 19 percent gain in 
daily sales domestic automakers reported monday 
there were eight sales days in the period this year and nine 
days in the period last year the percentage changes compare 
average daily sales not straight totals 
the daily sales rate for light trucks rose 32 percent while 
car sales rose 12 percent 
chrysler corp posted a 214 percent increase in car sales from 
a soft performance in the year earlier period car sales declined 
44 percent at general motors corp and 26 percent at ford motor 
co from strong midapril 1987 periods 
gm car sales totaled 112344 in midapril compared with fords 
65626 and chryslers 33842 
i think that april is going to be a month in which you are 
going to see auto sales go back to some sort of sustainable rate 
said jeanette garretty an industry analyst with bank of america in 
san francisco 
she said the easing sales were not surprising after automakers 
incentives kept sales brisker than expected for most of the first 
quarter 
ray windecker an analyst at ford said sales incentives had 
pushed industry sales to a 76 million seasonally adjusted annual 
rate in april 1987 a year that ended up averaging a 71 million 
rate this years midapril sales were at a 75 million seasonally 
adjusted annual rate 
these are good substantial sales against very strong sales 
last year windecker said its differences in timing of 
incentives more than anything else 
among foreign manufacturers making cars in us plants american 
honda which moved more production to the united states sold 
10738 of its usmade cars in the period up from 6488 a year 
earlier 
nissan usas sales of 2950 usmade cars represented a 193

ah belo corp said monday its earnings declined 
by 59 percent in the first quarter of 1988 from the same period 
last year due to higher operating costs and weak advertising 
demand 
the media company posted a profit of 896000 or 9 cents per 
share on revenue of 873 million during the three months ended 
march 31 that compared with earnings of 22 million or 20 cents 
per share on revenue of 875 million in first quarter 1987 
excluding revenue from two denver radio stations sold in 1987 
first quarter revenue would have been up by 19 million from a 
year earlier belo stated

programming costs higher newsprint costs and weak advertising 
demand

boeing co said monday its first quarter profit 
rose by 15 percent from a year earlier aided by reduced spending 
on research development and new business expenses 
boeing had net earnings of 136 million or 89 cents a share on 
sales of 361 billion in the quarter ended march 31 that compared 
with a profit of 118 million or 76 cents a share on sales of 
376 billion for the first quarter of 1987 
frank shrontz boeings chairman and chief execurive said the 
increase in first quarter profits was due primarily to lower levels 
of research development and other expenses for new commercial 
jetliners future military and space programs and computer and 
electronics work a lower federal income tax rate and increases in 
other income also helped he said 
shrontz said the lower expenses were offset partly by higher 
research development and production costs for commuter aircraft 
performance problems on military aircraft work and a higher share 
of costs on government contracts 
during the first quarter boeing received orders for 129 
commercial jets and six de havilland turboprop planes with a total 
value of 47 billion that compares with orders totaling 35 
billion in firstquarter 1987 
on monday boeing announced a 14 billion order by 
international leisure group the parent company of britains air 
europe for 30 boeing jetliners that order includes 22 757200s 
and eight 737400s subject to the completion of financing and was 
scheduled for delivery beginning in 1989 
government and foreign military sales fell 200 million to 11 
billion for the quarter but shrontz said military sales for the 
year were expected to be slightly higher than in 1987 
boeing had a backlog of 38 billion in unfinished orders at the 
end of the first quarter up from 332 billion at the end of 1987

the economy shrugging off the effects of the october stock 
market collapse grew at a 23 percent annual rate in the first 
three months of 1988 the government said today 
it also said aftertax corporate profits rose an even faster 26 
percent in the last three months of 1987 this was an upward 
revision from a month ago when the government put the increase in 
business profits at 16 percent 
a strong increase in consumer spending and the biggest surge in 
business investment in more than four years fueled the gross 
national product advance the commerce department said in its 
first look at overall economic performance this year 
the gnp report should put to rest any fears that the record 
508point drop in the stock market on oct 19 would topple the 
country into a recession economists said 
in addition the rate of inflation slowed with a price measure 
tied to the gnp rising at an annual rate of 24 percent down from 
a 27 percent increase in the fourth quarter 
the reports came amid a continuing modest rebound in home sales 
from a winter slump a recovery experts say reflects a decline in 
mortgage interest rates 
sales of existing homes edged up 25 percent last month the 
national association of realtors said monday as it reported that 
singlefamily homes sold at a seasonally adjusted rate of 333 
million units 
despite the march rise which followed a 25 percent increase in 
february the rate of sales remained 98 percent below that of 
march 1987 the sales pace had dipped in november december and 
january after mortgage rates increased 
meanwhile trading on financial markets was quiet as investors 
awaited todays release of first quarter gross national product 
figures reflecting the economys growth rate from january through 
march 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 
2221 points to 203730 trading was moderate 
the dollar was mixed and many dealers attributed the currencys 
behavior partly to uncertainty about the gnp report bond prices 
dipped pushing interest rates higher 
the home sales increase was expected to carry over into april 
said john a tuccillo the realtors chief economist 
mark obrinsky an economist with the us league of savings 
institutions said interest rates likely would to rise slowly and 
steadily this year but predicted the rise would disrupt sales less 
than the sharp jumps by interest rates in 1987 
a year ago 30year fixedrate mortgages bottomed out at just 
above 9 percent they rose in spurts topping 115 percent in early 
october rates eased after the stock market crash dipping just 
below 10 percent in february and march before rising again to 103 
percent last week 
the march sales increase was accompanied by a 41 percent rise 
in prices to a national median or midpoint of 88700 from 
88100 in february tuccillo predicted only modest increases for 
the rest of the year

the governments case against three men accused 
of defrauding continental illinois national bank is as shaky as a 
broken threelegged stool a defense attorney contends 
if any leg is missing it wont stand up and at any point in 
this case one or more of the legs are missing said attorney 
burck bailey who represents william patterson former head of oil 
and gas lending at the failed penn square bank of oklahoma city 
the government charged that patterson joined with tulsa oil 
driller jere sturgis and another bank officer john lytle in a 
scheme to defraud the chicago bank the three men pleaded innocent 
to charges of fraud and misapplication of funds 
closing arguments in the 6week trial before us district 
judge milton shadur were expected to be completed today before the 
case goes to the jury 
in his closing argument monday bailey contended that 
continental was saddled with troublesome oil and energy loans 
because of an aggressive lending policy not because of a fraud 
scheme 
between july 1981 and 1982 when the alleged fraud scheme took 
place there was the widely held view that oil and gas prices 
would rise so quickly that time would take care of any problems 
with these loans bailey said 
lytle a former continental vice president was accused of 
taking kickbacks in exchange for funding highrisk energy loans 
from continental illinois national bank amp trust co to penn square 
customers 
the government also contended lytle and sturgis engaged in an 
investment scheme in which sturgis inflated the return on lytles 
investment threefold so he could receive a favorable loan from 
continental sturgis never received the loan but made several 
attempts according to court records 
assistant us attorney ted helwig portrayed lytle a 20year 
employee at continental as a bank officer who needed the money 
because he was living well beyond his means 
he had become so completely dependent on bill patterson he no 
longer had the interest of continental first and foremost helwig 
added 
the indictment cited lytles involvement in 44 million in loans 
made by continental to 12 penn square customers it did not say how 
much was recovered by the chicago bank which came to the brink of 
collapse in 1984 in part because of its troubled energy loans 
the loans to customers of penn square which failed in july 
1982 were approved at about the same time lytle received nearly 
600000 in kickbacks from patterson in the form of unsecured 
personal loans from penn square helwig said 
lytle impassive during government arguments took notes monday 
he sat facing the jury wearing a brown suit and scuffed penny 
loafers one with a hole in the sole 
his attorney james streicker noted that even when continental 
officials began reviewing lytles potential conflictofinterest no 
one told him to stop making loans to penn square customers 
because in spite of all the problems continental bank wanted 
the business streicker said

international business machines corp may sell its 16 percent 
chunk of mci communications corp back to the company over the next 
several years the head of the worlds biggest computer company 
said 
the disclosure by ibm chairman john f akers substantiated 
earlier eports that mci wants to repurchase the stake which ibm 
bought three years ago when the longdistance telecommunications 
company was weaker than it is now mcis profit and revenue have 
since risen significantly 
akers statement also further weakened a theory that ibms 
original interest in mci would lead to a major confrontation with 
american telephone amp telegraph co the longdistance phone giant 
that also has been trying to develop a computer vending business 
since then atampts performance in the computer market has been 
considered disappointing while ibms attempts to develop its 
telecommunications business also has been slow 
akers spoke in response to a shareholder question monday at 
ibms annual meeting in richmond va he was asked about future 
plans for the companys investment in mci 
we dont have any plans to increase our holdings with mci 
although contractually they can ask us to if they so desire 
akers said he added that was unlikely because of mcis desire to 
repurchase the stock 
i would expect that would come to pass and that will be the 
action that youll see over the next several years akers said 
ibm initially made the investment then valued at about 427 
million under an agreement whereby mci acquired the assets of 
satellite business systems a competing longdistance phone company 
started by ibm in 1975

opec is launching an effort to persuade 
rival oil producers to help push up prices because the cartel is 
convinced it can no longer control world oil markets by itself 
oil ministers from five of the 13 members of the organization of 
petroleum exporting countries meet tonight with representatives of 
mexico china egypt and five other nonopec oil producers to 
discuss possible production cuts 
the meeting will mark the widest participation of noncartel oil 
exporters in direct talks with opec in history but many industry 
analysts say they see little chance of a firm accord this week on 
joint output cuts 
the opec ministers gathered at the cartels headquarters in 
central vienna at midday today to lay the groundwork for the joint 
meeting set for tonight 
rilwanu lukman the nigerian oil minister and president of opec 
offered no details of the meetings agenda as he entered the 
building 
we hope to have a good meeting a useful meeting he told 
reporters other officials declined to comment 
world oil prices have been falling as supplies exceed demand 
although the us government was not represented kent hance a 
member of the texas railroad commission was in vienna to talk with 
opec officials the commission regulates that states 2 million 
barrels a day of oil production 
hance said in an interview today he had met with fadhil chalabi 
the opec deputy secretary general and other members of the opec 
staff on monday 
the main thing is to establish a dialogue with the opec 
members he said the main message wed like to get across is 
stability for oil prices 
the texas economy has been severely hurt by the sharp decline in 
oil prices over the past two years 
hance declined to be specific when asked whether he would 
suggest to opec the possibility of texas imposing restraints on oil 
production in the state 
but platts oilgram news a new yorkbased industry newsletter 
quoted him tuesday as saying he couldnt make a deal on 
production even if he wanted to and that in such a case the 
other two railroad commissioners and the texas governor would have 
to be consulted 
the saudis seem to be very much against any oil production 
cuts graham andrews an analyst in the london office of the 
investment firm wood mackenzie and co said on monday 
he said in a telephone interview that one reason for the saudi 
reluctance may be to avoid allowing iran to use increased revenues 
from higher oil prices to strengthen its stand in the war against 
iraq the saudis indirectly support irag in the war that began in 
september 1980 on sunday iranian naval gunboats attacked a 
saudiowned tanker in the persian gulf 
opec decided earlier this month to invite eight noncartel oil 
exporters to vienna saying a broader base of nations must bear the 
burden of production restraint if prices are to return to opecs 
declared target of 18 a barrel most opec oil is selling for at 
least 2 a barrel less than the target price 
the nonopec countries participating in the vienna meeting are 
mexico china egypt oman angola malaysia colombia and brunei 
their production totals about 8 million barrels a day although 
their combined exports are believed to be less than half that 
in 1984 opec began inviting representatives of mexico egypt and 
other smaller producers to observe opec meetings in march 1986 it 
held direct negotiations with mexico and four other independent 
producers but no agreement was reached on production cuts

an investment group led by british 
industrialist brian beazer says its 17 billion hostile takeover 
bid for koppers co has been backed by a majority of the cement 
companys shareholders 
bns inc the takeover company beazer formed with shearson 
lehman hutton inc and national westminster bank disclosed monday 
that as of last friday 139 million of koppers common shares or 
534 percent had been tendered in response to its 60pershare 
offer 
if bns were able to consummate its offer those shares plus the 
21 million bns already holds would give it 569 percent of 
koppers stock 
but bns is barred by two federal court orders from actually 
purchasing more shares unless and until legal challenges to its 
offer are overturned 
one of those challenges which claims the takeover would violate 
antitrust laws will stand at least until may 13 when the federal 
court in san francisco hears an appear from bns 
koppers declined to comment on beazers tally but koppers 
spokesman roger beidler noted shareholders who have tendered their 
shares can still withdraw them at any time before the bns offer 
expires 
koppers has said it is studying ways to financially restructure 
in order to increase the value of its stock

early contract negotiations between 
chrysler corp and the united auto workers have soured but remain 
alive despite a noshow protest by union representatives and 
other frictions inside and outside of actual bargaining 
uaw negotiators and union leaders scheduled to begin this weeks 
meetings with chrysler on monday morning instead met privately for 
four hours and debated whether to continue the talks said uaw 
spokesman bob barbee 
while chryslers team cooled its heels union negotiators 
discussed the rankandfiles angry reaction to several 
announcements last week such as disclosure of chrysler chairman 
lee iacoccas eightfigure wages for 1987 that seemed timed to 
doom the talks 
the talks may be in fatal trouble already but its a little 
too early to tell said harley shaiken labor and technology 
expert at the university of california at san diego 
the union and the no 3 automaker are negotiating a replacement 
for a contract expiring sept 14 the contract covers at least 
66000 active and laidoff workers in 15 states and 65000 retirees 
angering the rank and file were revelations of executive 
compensation for 1987 that included nearly 18 million for iacocca 
and the planned transfer of waning kcar production from two us 
plants to one in mexico in 1989 
the union will urge chrysler to keep producing kcars the 
dodge aries and plymouth reliant at its jefferson avenue plant in 
detroit said marc stepp uaw vice president and head of the 
unions chrysler department 
the jefferson avenue plant produces fourdoor kcars while a 
toluca mexico factory produces twodoor models 
chrysler is scheduled to move omni and horizon production from a 
plant it is closing in wisconsin to the jefferson avenue plant this 
summer and said last week it would consolidate kcar production in 
mexico 
stepp said union officials think the plant can produce both 
cars we would urge the corporation to change its plan he said 
at the bargaining table talks that were supposed to last two to 
three weeks as the two sides fit an industrypattern contract to 
chrysler began to drag as chrysler made proposals guaranteed to be 
rejected 
chrysler vice president anthony st john has publicly said he 
will work within the jobprotecting pattern contract already in 
force at ford motor co and general motors corp but union 
officials say chrysler bargainers are strongly resisting it 
they have not come up with any pattern proposals chryslers 
first offer is garbage all takeaways were not going to take 
any concessions said tony defrancesco an official at uaw local 
624 in syracuse ny 
defrancesco was among nearly 100 officials of local unions at 
chrysler plants nationwide who gathered in huntsville ala 
thursday night and friday at the meeting the local leaders heard 
and booed company proposals and urged bargainers to break off 
talks according to defrancesco and others who attended 
chrysler spokesman lloyd northard said he still believed the two 
sides would reach an early settlement which had been intended to 
mend their damaged relationship 
chrysler seeks a minimum age for early retirement instead of the 
current 30andout provision which is the right to retire 
after 30 years in the factory regardless of age it wants workers 
to take vacations only when plants are shut down or lose them and 
wants workers who dont join prepaid health plans to pay 35 a 
month in insurance fees 
the automaker also wants widespread adoption of japanesestyle 
plant work agreements at a time when some plants that have accepted 
them are hitting snags in putting the socalled modern operating 
agreements into practice 
workers who made deep sacrifices that helped save chrysler in 
the early 1980s expected a return to normality once chrysler 
returned to profitability instead chrysler early this year 
announced plans to close a 5500worker former american motors 
corp assembly plant in kenosha wis that it had said would stay 
open at least five more years 
chryslers later attempt to sell its 28000worker acustar inc 
met with strike threats and other strong union opposition

the us economy shrugging off the effects of 
the october stock market collapse grew at a respectable 23 
percent annual rate in the first three months of 1988 the 
government said today 
the commerce department issuing its first look at overall 
economic performance this year said the increase in the gross 
national product was propelled by a strong increase in consumer 
spending and the biggest surge in business investment in more than 
four years 
economists said the balanced growth was good news for 
republicans in an election year and should bury lingering fears 
that the 508point drop in the stock market on oct 19 would topple 
the country into a recession 
this report presents a good healthy picture of the us 
economy in the first quarter nothing near a recession despite all 
the earlier worries said allen sinai chief economist of the 
boston co this is good political reading for the republicans 
the administration wasted no time in boasting about the gnp 
report 
so much for the recession that was supposed to occur in the 
first quarter commerce under secretary robert ortner said at a 
briefing for reporters todays report shows the economy entering 
its sixth year of expansion with inflation remaining moderate 
in further good news the growth was accompanied by a slowdown 
in the rate of inflation with a price measure tied to the gnp 
rising at an annual rate of 24 percent down from a 27 percent 
increase in the fourth quarter this slowdown should help allay 
fears that stronger consumer demand would push up prices and force 
the federal reserve board to raise interest rates to cool off 
demand 
the gnp grew at a much faster 48 percent rate in the 
octoberdecember quarter but analysts said that growth masked some 
dangerous imbalances that were not present in the first quarter 
report 
almost all of the fourth quarter increase in gnp wound up as 
unsold inventory sitting on shelves at the same time consumer 
spending was taking a rare nose dive falling by 25 percent the 
biggest drop in seven years this combination has in the past been 
a harbinger of a recession 
this pattern was reversed in the first quarter with business 
inventories which had risen by 394 billion in the fourth 
quarter falling by 132 billion in the first quarter indicating 
a success by businesses in reducing swollen inventories 
much of the success in working down the inventory bulge occurred 
in auto showrooms as dealers were aided by a new round of sales 
incentives 
this helped boost consumer spending by 236 billion in the 
first quarter a 38 percent annual rate of increase the report 
said more than half of that growth came in auto sales 
business investment for capital equipment shot up at an annual 
rate of 325 percent in the first quarter the fastest advance 
since a 395 percent increase in the fourth quarter of 1983 
in other good news the countrys trade deficit after removing 
the effects of inflation narrowed by 36 billion in the first 
quarter continuing the trend of improvement that began in mid1986 
the administration which is forecasting that gnp will grow 29 
percent for the full year is counting on further improvements in 
the trade deficit to supply almost half of gnp growth this year 
much of the rest of the increase is expected to come from higher 
business capital spending as companies expand production facilities 
to meet a growing export demand 
both of those trends were evident in todays gnp report 
providing good news for the reagan administration which is 
counting on a sixth straight year of economic growth to boost 
chances for a republican presidential win in november 
in another report the government said that aftertax corporate 
profits rose an even faster 26 percent in the final three months 
of 1987 this was an upward revision from a month ago when the 
government put the increase in business profits at 16 percent 
two factors that held back gnp growth in the first quarter were 
a 94 percent drop in residential construction spending and a 223 
percent drop in spending by the federal government reflecting in 
large part a swing in farm subsidy payments 
the various changes pushed the gnp after adjusting for 
inflation up by 218 billion to a new annual rate of 390 
trillion 
the first quarter growth was welcome news when compared to 
forecasts being made at the beginning of the year at the time 
some analysts were actually predicting that the gnp would decline 
in the first quarter signalling the start of a new recession 
the pessimists believed that a combination of the shock to 
consumer confidence from the stock market collapse and the huge 
overhang of business inventories would severely depress economic 
activity in the early part of this year 
the fear was that after a loss of a trillion dollars in wealth 
nervous consumers would stop spending and manufacturers caught 
with huge inventories of unsold goods would cut back on production 
and lay off workers 
but those events did not occur instead of cutting back after 
the market turmoil employers actually boosted hiring since 
october an average of 362000 new jobs have been added to the 
economy each month more than twice the size of the monthly gains 
before the crash 
the big gains in employment helped restore consumer confidence 
considered critical for the economys health since consumer 
spending accounts for twothirds of economic activity 
the reagan administration is predicting that the gnp will expand 
at a 29 percent annual rate this year marking the third 
consecutive year the economy has grown at this rate 
this view is in line with the outlook of many private 
forecasters as well blue chip economic indicators a sedona ariz 
newsletter said that its latest survey of 51 top economists found 
a consensus forecast for growth of 27 percent this year up 
significantly from a 19 percent gnp estimate made in the month 
following the market crash

an industry that weighs its products by the 
millions of tons and totals its sales in the billions of dollars is 
measuring one of steelmakings most promising technical 
breakthroughs by the inch 
the potential is there to shake up this industry analyst 
charles bradford of merrill lynch says of a machine that eliminates 
several major steps in the shaping or casting of liquid steel 
into slabs for further processing 
like other advances thinslab casting has the potential to 
reduce production costs including labor it also gives minimills 
smaller scrapmelting steelmakers an opening to markets dominated 
by the giant integrated companies that produce finished steel from 
ore 
the german firm sms schloemannsiemag ag has developed a caster 
that spits out a ribbon of steel two inches thick much thinner 
than the 10inchthick strands produced by todays slab casters 
the eight inches gained may not seem like much but theyre a 
world of difference to anyone who ever had to hammer a thick hunk 
of steel into a strip onetenth of an inch thick or paid to have 
that done by the thousands of tons per day as major steelmakers do 
in conventional hot strip mills 
roughly half of all the steel produced in the united states 
passes through hot strip mills which convert thick slabs of metal 
into thinner sheets that are used to make such things as car 
fenders office furniture and appliances 
sms says its thinslab casting process was tested in europe with 
good results and offers savings in machinery energy time and 
labor all of which mean money 
nucor corp hopes to reap those savings at a new plant in 
crawfordsville ind where sms is preparing the first commercial 
thinslab caster for a production start next april 
theyve achieved things that people didnt expect them to 
said keith kappmeyer vice president of research and technology for 
usx corp 
usx and bethlehem steel corp the nations no 1 and no 3 
steelmakers respectively aborted a 30 million federally funded 
development program after sms announced its breakthrough more than 
a year ago 
we were scooped he said 
kappmeyer said thinslab casting has been an ambition of 
steelmakers since the 19th century when a patent for a similar 
caster design was granted to henry bessemer the english engineer 
whose namesake furnace was the first hightonnage steelmaking 
process used by the industry 
until now the thinnest slabs possible on a continuous caster 
were six inches with 10inch slabs more common 
people are struggling to get down to six inches so to go 
from 10 inches to two inches is enormous it is an unknown 
territory said herbert fastert president of the german 
companys montvale njbased subsidiary sms concast inc 
the limiting factor had been the casters watercooled copper 
mold which shapes the molten steel while cooling the surface 
enough to hold the shape as the metal moves through continuously 
in conventional molds the intake and output openings are the same 
size 
the ingenious idea that sms engineers had was to use a 
funnelshaped mold and to put the steel through at faster rate 250 
inches per minute compared to 60 inches in conventional molds 
fastert said 
the principle is so simple people said its crazy he said 
it is crazy to suggest you do it in a funnel because when it 
gets stuck in the funnel and you pull it out and it breaks all 
your steel will run out you lose three or four tons of liquid 
steel all over your equipment 
if you do it fast enough you can do what at slow speed you 
could never achieve fastert said i liken it to water skiiing 
if you dont have the courage to go fast youll never get out of 
the water 
nucors interest in the new caster fits the style of the lean 
and aggressive charlotte nc company one of the efficient 
minimill operators that helped rebuff cheap imports of concrete 
reinforcing bar and other lowvalue products 
weve always made an effort to use the latest technology 
said nucor chairman kenneth iverson 
the innovative caster will help nucor break into the market for 
flatrolled steel sheet which had been the province of integrated 
companies whose excess capacity led to cutthroat competition 
through most of this decade 
when you go into a market that has overcapacity youve got to 
be prepared to push somebody else out iverson said youve got 
to have a competitive advantage 
the crawfordsville ind caster nucors edge will be coupled 
with a streamlined mill to produce flatrolled steel the plant 
will cost 230 million compared to a billion for an integrated 
hot strip mill he said 
sms says the quality of its thincast strip meets or beats 
conventionally produced steel and iverson said he expects to lop 
50 to 75 off the average price of 400 per ton for strip 
this is the first time that a minimill has been built for 
flatrolled products iverson said theres just a whole group 
of people who are looking at it and watching us 
the entry of a minimill operator into flatrolled steel may not 
faze some of the giants of the industry but lesser competitors 
could be challenged analysts say 
none of this is going to be a problem for the first few years 
but i know six people who want to buy the second sms caster

theyre relatively young they 
wear jeans and support the antinuclear movement but swear their 
new bank the first of its kind in west germany will be as 
financially sound as any other 
set to open tuesday may 2 the oekobank or ecology bank 
will adhere to a new kind of political and environmental conscience 
the oekobank will support projects such as alternative energy 
development pesticidefree agriculture and womens selfhelp 
centers but eschew investments linked with for example the arms 
industry or south africa 
dubbed the bankers in tennis shoes by the national press 
the informally dressed leftistoriented crew stresses its still 
adhering to traditional profitmaking goals 
the main difference between the oekobank and regular banks is 
our stance on political and environmental issues but our working 
methods are the same oekobank spokesman torsten martin 34 said 
good intentions are fine but the numbers have to balance 
martin added speaking in german 
all nine staff members have years of bank or economics training 
and experience behind them director hanspeter schreiner 40 has 
served on the board of directors at two banks 
the oekobank is drawing considerable media attention including 
recent articles in leading newsmagazine der spiegel and the 
conservative frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper 
the ecology bankers want a new type of money house that offers 
customers a chance they wouldnt get in the big institutions der 
spiegel said in a march 21 article 
the frankfurt banking establishment including the mighty 
deutsche bank has so far declined to comment publicly about the 
upstart institution 
the established banks certainly dont regard us as 
competition schreiner said 
the oekobank with about 77 million marks 45 million of 
equity capital will be a lilliputian among financial institutions 
the deutsche bank for example has about 97 billion marks of 
capital 57 billion 
the oekobanks only office is located in the homey neighborhood 
of north end blocks away from the glittering towers of the 
deutsche bank kommerzbank and other giants in west germanys 
highpowered financial center 
west germanys overseeing body for banks the federal 
supervisory office for credit institutions gave the oekobank its 
final approval on march 7 but imposed several restrictions 
the oekobank for example will limit its credit volume to three 
times the amount of its equity capital although the law allows 
banks to issue credit up to 18 times that amount martin said 
restrictions were necessary partly because the oekobank has not 
been accepted into a deposit protection fund a fund among banks 
which acts as a sort of insurance for bank customers 
several innovations will enable the oekobank to put its 
political and environmental ideals into practice martin said 
one will allow customers to invest in savings certificates 
linked to specific environmental or social causes 
another enables borrowers to form a guarantors pool for loans 
for example 10 people wishing to start a business could take out a 
loan of 50000 marks each person guaranteeing 5000 
many banks wouldnt spend the additional time needed to 
administer such an arrangement martin said 
the oekobankers may prove there is a market gap in west germany 
for a bank with a liberal conscience 
enthusiasm for the environmentalist causes of the greens party 
for example is still running strong and thousands of protestors 
regularly show up for nuclear disarmament demonstrations 
but the ecology bankers say they are independent of political 
parties despite having regional greens groups among their backers 
and a ranking social democrat federal parliamentary deputy on the 
board of directors 
were not a greens party bank or a bank only for liberals or 
the little man martin said environmental destruction the 
arms buildup and disasters like chernobyl are affecting people of 
all classes and political beliefs 
oekobankers are also tapping into the evergrowing area of 
alternative businesses a broad variety of companies often 
headed by young entrepreneurs and based on collective ownership 
well be there for unconventional entrepreneurs whose ideas 
are often rejected by established banks schreiner said 
but the oekobank will also help customers with nonpolitical 
causes such as car payments and home repairs he said

this bustling city the largest 
richest and most industrialized in northern mexico rode into the 
20th century on a wave of suds from carta blanca the beer that 
made monterrey famous 
its the granddaddy of all mexican beers a golden brew that 
helped turn a small brewery into a major corporation and a sleepy 
town into an industrial giant 
monterrey has come a long way since the fledgling cuauhtemoc 
brewery first put a cap on a bottle of carta blanca nearly a 
century ago 
a sprawling city of 28 million people today monterrey had just 
40000 inhabitants and a few small factories in 1890 when a group 
of local investors started the brewery named for the last aztec 
emperor cuauhtemoc pronounced cwowtaymoc 
it was contagious said the historian and author israel 
cavazos the enthusiasm to create other industries caught on 
the brewerys needs were large at the turn of the century and it 
wasnt easy to get raw materials from mexico city 600 miles to the 
south or from the united states 150 miles north 
cuauhtemocs directors created departments to manufacture the 
raw materials malt glass to make bottles tin for caps paper for 
labels cardboard for cases 
those departments spawned seven incorporated industries that 
later became catalysts for the major industrial conglomerates visa 
alfa and vitro 
the brewery was the cornerstone of monterreys industrial 
development said jorge montemayor cuauhtemocs planning 
director 
the brewery now a division of visa started operations with 72 
workers in a house in what is now downtown monterrey it produced 
1500 bottles of carta blanca the first year 
by 1987 cuauhtemocs seven breweries throughout mexico had 
4409 employees producing about 1 billion quarts of beer each year 
in addition to carta blanca still one of mexicos most popular 
beers cuauhtemoc makes tecate and chihuahua beers its 
bestselling export products 
its premium bohemia brand won first prize among 35 domestic and 
foreign lager beers in a los angeles times magazine beertasting 
contest last summer 
if cuauhtemoc launched what is known as the monterrey 
phenomenon the unique industrial development of a city so far 
from the nations capital it also led the way in social and 
educational development programs for employees 
before the government created a federal medical program 
families of cuauhtemoc employees were receiving free medical care 
at company clinics before the federal government started lowcost 
housing programs the company was helping its employees build their 
homes 
in 1912 the brewery founded monterreys cuauhtemoc polytechnic 
school which offered primary level classes to employees children 
during the day and to workers at night the monterrey technological 
institute now one of mexicos leading universities developed from 
the school 
today the brewery also provides free dental care lowinterest 
loans savings programs and university scholarships its sports and 
cultural center sponsors soccer teams and offers classes in 
swimming karate singing dancing and guitar 
erik eduardo larsen whose grandfather came to monterrey from 
denmark in the early 1930s to take a job at the cuauhtemoc brewery 
is the third generation of larsens to work here 
the company doesnt think just about production its 
concerned with people too said the 22yearold systems analyst 
whose father was cuauhtemocs production chief 
its like a family here he said and the pay is better 
than at other companies 
salaries for laborers start 30 percent higher than monterreys 
daily minimum wage of 7405 pesos about 320 
the current economic crisis however has been tough on the 
local beer industry and the brewery is operating at a loss 
in 1983 the year after the crisis began cuauhtemocs domestic 
sales dropped by nearly 13 million cases as consumers watched 
their salaries eaten up by soaring inflation 
last year however the brewery achieved precrisis production 
levels and is negotiating with foreign creditors to restructure 
debts while pushing exports to generate us dollars 
although the immense popularity of corona extra beer in the 
united states has made cuauhtemocs main competitor the modelo 
brewery even stronger planning director montemayor said his 
company is reaping some benefits from it 
coronas success has helped us too its made the american 
consumer more aware of mexican beer he said 
an aggressive sales and distribution campaign coupled with a 
new american thirst for mexican beer has helped cuauhtemoc more 
than double its exports sales since the economic crisis began 
in 1987 cuauhtemoc exported 47 million cases of beer 
generating 292 million 
cuauhtemoc with 33 percent of the domestic beer market is the 
second largest of mexicos three beer manufacturers after the 
modelo brewery 
in 1985 the financially troubled moctezuma brewery was acquired 
by visas holding company fomento proa in an exchange of stock that 
prevented modelo from acquiring it and becoming a force too large 
to deal with in the mexican beer industry said montemayor

texaco inc the nations thirdlargest oil 
company today announced that its firstquarter earnings rose by 
105 percent compared with the same period last year 
the white plains nybased company said it earned 242 
million or 100 per share on 87 billion of revenue vs 118 
million or 49 cents per share on 85 billion in 1987 
firstquarter sales 
the latest earnings included a 66 million gain on the sale of 
texacos interest in an offshore angola joint venture as well as 
29 million gain on foreign currency transactions which compared 
with a 7 million loss in the same period last year the company 
said 
it also included an increase of corporate and nonoperating 
charges to 249 million from 100 million in the 1987 first quarter 
that hike was due in part to the recognition in the 1987 
quarter of 73 million in nonrecurring benefits relating to prior 
years income tax adjustments texaco said 
the legal and related costs associated with the bankruptcy 
proceedings and the financing expenses incident to the companys 
ultimate emergence from chapter 11 also contributed to the increase 
in corporate expenses the company said 
otherwise texaco president james w kinnear said its 
performance was helped by improved domestic refining and marketing 
margins and strong petrochemical results 
slumping crude prices were offset by improved earnings from 
natural gas operations due to settlement of certain takeorpay 
issues and higher natural gas sales prices and volumes the company 
said 
texaco emerged from chapter 11 earlier this month in a 
reorganization that included a 3 billion payment to pennzoil co 
to settle a 103 judgment held against texaco by pennzoil 
resulting from a jurys decision that texaco had improperly 
interfered with a pennzoil acquisition of part of getty oil co

united airlines pilots are suing the airline its 
parent allegis corp and the machinists union in an effort to 
strike down contract provisions they say could block an employee 
takeover of united 
the lawsuit was filed monday in us district court in chicago 
by the airline pilots association said hank krakowski a union 
spokesman 
the suit challenges two provisions in a november agreement 
between united and the machinists union krakowski said 
we want a judgment from the court to declare that these 
provisions are illegal so we can move forward in our attempts to 
affect employee ownership of united airlines he said 
one provision prohibits the union from participating in an 
employee ownership plan unless the machinists union agrees to the 
terms 
the other contested provision would give the machinists the 
option of receiving substantial pay increases reopening their 
contract or striking in the event of a change in control of allegis 
the pilots lawsuit alleges that the provisions called 
protective covenants are part of an illegal campaign by united 
directors to entrench themselves in office at the expense of 
allegis shareholders the union stated 
we havent seen the suit so we have no comment said united 
spokesman joe hopkins 
dan sheehy another united spokesman said the provisions 
addressed in the suit are part of a threeyear agreement between 
the company and the union regarding work and wage rules 
details of it arent for public consumption he said 
a spokesman for the machinists union could not be reached for 
comment monday night 
united pilots have been working toward an employee takeover for 
about a year but the machinists union has opposed the plan 
united pilots made an unsuccessful 45 billion bid for the 
airline last april opposing allegis diversification into a travel 
services conglomerate the offer led to a proxy fight by a new york 
investor group coniston partners to unseat allegis directors and 
allegis chairman richard ferris later resigned 
allegis directors agreed to sell the companys hotel and rental 
car businesses and to drop the allegis name as part of a 365 
billion restructuring plan

soybean futures prices rose sharply in late 
trading tuesday on the chicago board of trade closing as much as 
18 cents higher 
the late surge on heavy trading volume followed comments made in 
washington by an agriculture department official that farmers 
signing up for price support programs had agreed to take 35 
million acres out of corn production instead of the 15 million 
acres that the market had anticpated said victor lespinasse a 
trader for dean witter reynolds inc 
the acreage could not be used for soybean production which adds 
new tension to a market already stressed by fears of tight supplies 
that was the catalyst lespinasse said 
he said speculation that pakistan might be offered 50000 tons 
of us soybean oil under a subsidized export program added further 
fuel to the soybean rally 
corn and wheat futures advanced in sympathy with soybeans 
analysts said 
at the close wheat was cent to 1 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in may at 312 a bushel corn was cent to 
1 cents higher with may at 200 a bushel oats were unchanged to 
cent higher with may at 165 a bushel soybeans were 16 cents 
to 18 cents higher with may at 677 a bushel

game wants a match that will last with media general inc 
but the family that controls the media empire through a special 
class of stock hopes shareholders will give sugarmans 16 billion 
takeover bid the cutoff treatment accorded many contestants on 
another sugarman program the gong show 
the takeover fight under way in advance of media generals may 
20 shareholders meeting has been waged on three fronts in court 
in proxy materials and in newspaper advertisements 
the battle is being monitored closely by major publishers 
including the washington post co the new york times co and dow 
jones amp co among other media companies that have dual classes of 
stock intended to keep control in the hands of a few people the 
graham family is seeking to tighten its grip on washington post

bid for media general 
sugarman through two companies he heads offered in february to 
pay 6150 a share for the nearly 90 percent of media general stock 
he does not control 
but the family of media general chairman d tennant bryan 
declined the offer expressing a desire to keep the richmondbased 
company independent 
sugarman controls just over 10 percent of the 28 million shares 
of media generals class a common stock but the bryan family owns 
71 percent of the more powerful 559168 outstanding class b shares 
which elect seven of the companys 10 directors 
in lawsuits filed last month in us district court in richmond 
media general accused sugarman of inciting speculation in the 
companys stock management also wants the court to order sugarman 
to sell his shares 
sugarman meanwhile asked the court to allow media general 
shareholders to vote as a single class on his offer and maintained 
only the three class a directors should be allowed to consider the 
buyout 
media generals management contends the buyout requires approval 
of twothirds of each class voting separately but sugarman says a 
majority vote of the combined class a and b shares is all that is 
necessary for ratification 
a hearing is set for wednesday in the court dispute 
after the suits were filed sugarman placed fullpage ads in the 
wall street journal and two media general daily newspapers the 
richmond timesdispatch and the richmond news leader 
the ads criticized the companys twotier stock arrangement and 
asked shareholders not to vote on managements proxy statement

david gotterer vice chairman of the two sugarman companies that 
control the media general stock barris industries inc of beverly 
hills calif and giant group ltd of harleyville sc

controlling interest in swiss watchmakers piaget sa and baume amp 
mercier sa a move that will give the french luxury products 
company a commanding share of the upscale watch market

chairman alain perrin said the acquisition should help boost 
cartiers sales to 840 million this year piaget and baume amp 
mercier had combined sales of 162 million last year 
perrin also said the acquisition will give cartier control of 
more than 40 percent of the 22 billion international luxury watch 
market and the combined company should pose a formidable challenge 
to upscale watchmaker rolex 
the two companies will be held through piaget baume amp mercier 
holding a parent company that will be 75 percent owned by cartier 
and 25 percent owned by luxco a luxembourgbased holding company 
that cartier and its partners control 
the holding company will hold 60 percent of both piaget and 
baume amp mercier and the piaget family will retain the remaining 
interest in each company 
both piaget and baume amp mercier which are owned by the piaget 
family will retain their management at least for the time 
being perrin said 
the move follows a wave of mergers and acquisitions in the 
international luxury goods business with further consolidation 
likely in the watchmaking industry 
perrin disclosed cartier hopes within the next year to gain a 
controlling interest in ebel sa another swiss watchmaker 
he also said discussions are underway with two other 
privatelyowned european luxury goods companies with a view to 
expanding cartiers market share in other product lines but he 
declined to give details 
in addition to watches cartier is known for its jewelry 
cigarette lighters luxury leather goods and perfumes 
cartier is 468 percent owned by rothmans international plc of 
britain sofina sa a unit of the societe generale de belgique 
group of belgium and the us brokerage firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc hold up to 18 percent of cartier perrin would not 
identify other cartier shareholders 
cartiers consolidated sales jumped by 368 percent last year to 
680 million from 497 million in 1986 while aggregate sales of 
piaget and baume amp mercier were up 15 percent to 1619 million 
cartier has never disclosed its earnings but perrin said the 
companys sales could reach 840 million this year 
piaget which initiated the takeover talks with cartier holds 
the no 1 position for luxury watch sales in the united states 
despite a sales slump that hit the sector in 1986 perrin said

the stock market posted some modest gains today 
although it gave back some of the mornings advance during 
afternoon trading 
the market gained strength through most of the morning but 
retreated in the early afternoon before advancing once again in the 
final hour 
trading was relatively light 
before the market opened the government reported that the the 
economy grew at a 23 percent annual rate in the first three months 
of 1988 
that was down from growth of 48 percent in the octoberdecember 
quarter but the growth estimate fell well within most forecasts 
analysts said the market has taken some encouragement from the 
fact that the economy has not bogged down as some had feared after 
last octobers crash 
but they noted that many individual investors remain leery about 
getting back into the market because of the volatility that has 
followed the crash

contract talks between chrysler corp and the 
united auto workers appeared back on track tuesday after a week of 
rankandfile pressure that led to a uaw boycott of the talks a day 
earlier 
meanwhile chrysler opened separate talks tuesday with local 
union leaders from kenosha wis over the closing of a 
5500worker assembly plant and a pact covering 1000 workers at a 
remaining engine plant 
uaw local 72 president ed steagall and chairman rudy kuzel 
along with national uaw representatives were meeting with a 
chrysler team led by union relations manager james carmichael said

for the uaw and chrysler to handle the negotiations stepp also is 
bargaining with general dynamics land systems division and several 
battery companies 
chrysler announced early this year that it will close by years 
end a former american motors corp assembly plant in kenosha but 
leave open a neighboring engine plant the announcement angered 
workers and wisconsin officials who had assumed chrysler would be a 
strong provider of jobs 
at the national contract negotiations chrysler and the uaw 
continued talking tuesday in an atmosphere that improved after a 
protest monday by uaw bargainers who boycotted the talks for 
several hours 
union bargainers had debated whether to break off the early 
negotiations because of what they considered disruptive 
announcements the previous week including chrysler chairman lee 
iacoccas 18 million 1987 earnings 
rankandfile members also were angered by chryslers decision 
to halt us production of its dodge aries and plymouth reliant 
kcars at the end of the year and fill 1989 orders by increasing 
production at a mexican plant 
on thursday and friday local union leaders received detailed 
reports of chryslers initial contract proposals which veered 
sharply from a jobprotecting industrypattern pact established 
last fall at ford motor co and general motors corp 
the contract which covers 66000 active and laidoff workers in 
15 states and 65000 retirees expires sept 14 the two sides 
agreed to early talks to prevent further deterioration in their 
damaged relationship 
workers already angered by the kenosha decision threatened to 
cripple chrysler with plantbyplant strikes and general 
noncooperation when it attempted to sell its 28000worker acustar 
inc parts subsidiary 
chrysler backed off from the sale and asked for early talks in 
march

narrow range a dealer in london noted that the gnp figure hasnt

reaction to reports that saudi arabia might break diplomatic 
relations with iran

the colon free zone normally one 
of the worlds busiest trading centers is unusually quiet these 
days 
huge container trucks stand unused in the zones narrow streets 
empty cardboard boxes are piled on the sidewalks and workers sit 
idle waiting for something to do 
panamas political and economic crisis has dealt a severe blow 
to the colon free zone considered the second largest in the world 
after hong kong 
since the deepening of the nations woes in late february trade 
has slowed dramatically small firms have shut their doors and 
employees have been placed on unpaid leave 
the situation couldnt be worse said francisco anderson 
president of the colon free zone users association which 
represents businesses here 
jaime v mizrachi manager of mizratex said weve never seen 
a situation like this ever 
and a truck driver who refused to give his name for fear of 
reprisals said theres nothing to do 
hes had little work in nearly two months he said there are 
few buyers purchasing goods that need to be hauled outside the 
zone the total value of trade in the center was 2054 million in 
march a 361 percent drop from march 1987 according to the zones 
administrative office 
broken down the figures show that the value of goods imported 
to the zone plunged 549 percent last month exports were off 174 
percent 
anderson expects an even worse trade picture this month he 
projects a decline of 50 percent or more in the total value of 
commerce 
the current situation puts in imminent danger the existence of 
the firms and the 8000 permanent jobs of panamanians who work in 
the zone the users association said recently 
the contraction comes after businesses rang up 433 billion in 
trade in all of last year the highest since the 94acre center was 
created in 1948 
before the crisis virtually paralyzed the nations economy 
government officials had been projecting another banner year in 
1988 latin american countries the zones target group have 
shaken off some of their economic woes and been more flush with 
cash in recent years 
located in the city of colon at the caribbean entrance to the 
panama canal the free zone acts as a channel for trade 
such consumer goods as televisions jewelry cosmetics 
clothing liquor and pharmaceuticals flow into the zone from japan 
the united states taiwan hong kong britain switzerland and 
elsewhere 
once in the zone the products are stored repackaged taken 
apart or put together and sent on to buyers mostly in latin america 
if bound for other countries goods are free of duties 
assessments and fees profits are taxed at low rates 
more than 700 companies have set up shop in the zone and 
hundreds more are represented here 
but with the nations latest troubles businessmen say some 
small firms have already packed up and left if you take a walk 
you can see a lot of places that say for rent or for sale 
said anderson two months ago you couldnt get 50 meters of 
space in here to rent out 
he is worried that those that go are not going to come back 
and its going to be very difficult to get new business 
the key problem for the zone was the governments march 3 
closure of the nations international banking center the banks 
suffered a cash squeeze aggravated by the freezing of official 
panamanian deposits in us banks the shortage prevented the 
government from providing panamas dozen locally owned and operated 
banks with enough money to cover a run on deposits that began feb 
26 when military strongman gen manuel antonio noriega ousted 
the president eric arturo delvalle 
since then the reagan administration has imposed sweeping 
sanctions on panama in an effort to force the removal of noriega 
who is under indictment in the united states on drug trafficking 
charges 
the closing of the banks has been the most damaging single 
effect on the free zone said alfredo l maduro general manager 
of the firm herbert toledano 
the trade center is highly dependent on credit money is lent to 
firms in the zone to buy imports and to latin american buyers who 
then purchase those goods for reexport 
ninetyfive percent of the business in the free zone 
involves banking said anderson we do it through banks we 
dont use cash at all 
the national banking commission the governments bank 
regulatory agency has recently permitted the nations 
approximately 120 banks to resume limited operations 
late monday the commission announced the banks could resume 
with certain restrictions handling letters of credit an 
instrument widely used in the free zone to guarantee payment 
businessmen doubted the step would have much impact on their 
trade because of the restricted service and uncertainty about the 
nations future

the stock market posted some modest gains 
tuesday bouncing back in the final hour of trading after the 
mornings strong advance faded in the early afternoon 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials up more than 20 points 
on monday and nearly 17 points in the morning finished with an 
879point gain to close at 204476 
it was the fourth consecutive gain in the markets bestknown 
indicator mondays close was revised to 203597 
advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 3 to 2 in the 
overall tally of new york stock exchangelisted issues with 926

before trading started the government reported that the the 
economy grew at a 23 percent annual rate in the first three months 
of 1988 
the firstquarter expansion in the gross national product which 
followed a 48 percent rise in the fourth quarter of 1987 had been 
widely anticipated 
nonetheless analysts said the market took some encouragement 
from the fact that the economy had neither bogged down as some had 
feared after last octobers crash nor accelerated in a fashion that 
might force the federal reserve to restrain it by encouraging 
higher rates of interest 
what wall street needs is moderation not a boom or a bust but 
an economy that is just chugging along said larry wachtel a 
market analyst for prudentialbache securities inc the gnp 
numbers were just that chugging along 
jack solomon a technical analyst for bear stearns amp co said 
the market welcomed the slower rate of growth because the feeling 
is no one will be toying with money rates because the economy was 
overheating 
some recent reports of strong firstquarter earnings were also 
cited as helping stock prices 
but other analysts noted the relatively slow pace of trading 
and worried that gains recorded in such an environment could easily 
be wiped out at the first suggestion of more negative economic 
developments 
gene jay seagle director of technical analysis for gruntal amp 
co inc said the afternoon price pullback followed rumors that 
nonopec members were close to an agreement with members of the 
cartel on oil production cutbacks that would help keep prices up 
within an hour the dow jones industrials retreated from being 
up 1625 points to being down about three points the

koppers co on tuesday charged an investment 
group headed by british industrialist brian beazer violated court 
orders by attempting to acquire shares in his 17 billion hostile 
takeover bid 
two courts have barred bns inc formed by beazer shearson 
lehman hutton inc and national westminster bank from buying more 
shares in its 60pershare bid for the pittsburghbased cement 
company 
bns said that as of last friday 139 million of koppers common 
shares or 534 percent had been tendered 
if bns were able to consummate its offer those shares plus the 
21 million bns already holds would give the group 569 percent of 
koppers stock 
koppers on tuesday asked the us district court in pittsburgh 
to order bns to testify whether court orders involving stock 
purchases have been violated 
koppers said bns has taken a series of actions that are not 
only contemptuous but a fraud on the market 
beazer spokeswoman lissa perlman said the company had no 
immediate comment 
separately a federal court in san francisco also has prohibited 
bns from attempting to acquire a controlling interest in koppers 
common stock on the grounds that the takeover might violate 
antitrust laws 
the order will stand at least until may 13 when the court is 
scheduled to hear the bns appeal 
koppers also asked the pittsburgh court to order bns to extend 
its bid indefinitely the offer which has been extended weekly is 
set to expire at midnight friday unless extended again 
some analysts said the number of shares tendered combined with 
apparent lack of progress by koppers board in developing a 
competing plan could force koppers to negotiate with bns 
greg drahuschak of butcher amp singer inc in pittsburgh said 
koppers might have to reconsider its opposition to the bid if the 
shares tendered reach 65 percent to 70 percent by the end of the 
week 
without approval from koppers board bns would have to get 85 
percent of koppers shares for its bid to be successful under 
provisions of the antitakeover law in delaware where koppers is 
incorporated

soybean futures prices soared in late trading tuesday on the 
chicago board of trade gaining as much as 18 cents a bushel on 
indications that fewer acres will be available for soybean 
production grain futures also advanced 
on other markets energy and precious metals futures increased 
livestock and meat were mostly higher and stockindex futures rose 
the late soybean rally followed comments made in washington by 
an agriculture department official that the usda expects about 9 
million acres to be put into its optional program for wheat and 
feed grains analysts said 
the pricesupport program pays farmers 92 percent of their 
normal deficiency payments regardless of how little acreage they 
plant 
ralph klopfenstein a deputy administrator in the agricultural 
stabilization and conservation service said farmers signing up for 
the program were expected to take 35 million acres out of corn 
production instead of the 15 million acres the market had 
anticpated said victor lespinasse a trader for dean witter 
reynolds inc 
that acreage could not be used for soybean production which 
adds new tension to a market already stressed by fears of tight 
supplies 
that was the catalyst lespinasse said 
analyst jerry gidel of chicagobased gh miller amp co said the 
message was clear usda officials indicated there could be less 
acreage of both corn and soybeans this spring he said 
speculation that pakistan might be offered 50000 tons of us 
soybean oil under a subsidized export program added further fuel to 
the soybean rally lespinasse said

lucky stores inc which three weeks ago 
rejected a 174 billion takeover bid that would have created the 
nations largest supermarket chain said tuesday it has received 
other takeover proposals 
lucky californias secondbiggest grocery chain said it was 
reviewing the new bids as well as other possibilities that would 
benefit shareholders more than american stores cos pending tender 
offer of 45 a share 
a spokeswoman for lucky declined to elaborate on the brief 
formal statement 
the companys soaring stock which was trading at 32 a share a 
month ago before american stores announced its offer closed up 
another 137 to 5537 tuesday on the new york stock exchange 
in a separate development american stores which has extended 
the deadline on its offer to saturday suggested to the securities 
and exchange commission that lucky hold an auction among interested 
parties 
industry analysts said they had only vague ideas as to the 
identity of luckys new suitors but said the company would be an 
attractive acquisition 
its one of the largest in california with a very strong 
identity of being the lowprice leader and it has a meaningful 
position in florida and its a wellrun company said ron rotter 
of morgan olmstead kennedy amp gardner in los angeles 
lucky based in dublin about 25 miles east of san francisco 
employs 39000 people and has 480 outlets with 340 stores in 
california it is smaller only than safeway among supermarket 
chains based in the state 
in march salt lake citybased american stores offered 174 
billion to acquire luckys 386 million outstanding shares the bid 
came just 17 months after lucky derailed a hostile takeover attempt 
by new york investor asher edelman 
american stores a grocery and drugstore chain has 1700 
outlets in 40 states a merger with lucky would create the nations 
largest supermarket chain surpassing kroger co 
but lucky turned the offer down and also rejected american 
stores proposal to raise the bid to 50 a share or 193 billion 
in a negotiated acquisition in a statement luckys board of 
directors said its financial adviser goldman sachs amp co 
considered both offers inadequate 
the lucky board also authorized the companys management to 
consider other ways to ncrease shareholder value including a 
possible reorganization of the company to focus on california a 
leveraged recapitalization with a possible special payment to 
shareholders and a negotiated sale of the company 
lucky chairman john lillie had asked interested parties to 
submit bids by monday 
just knowing management i think they would just like to 
remain independent rotter said 
they are under the gun to enhance shareholders value maybe 
through a leveraged buyout or having someone acquire them that is 
not a supermarket retail company and who would let the existing 
management team run the company he said

polaroid corp said tuesday that its 
first quarter profit slipped nearly 50 percent from a year ago 
despite a moderate rise in worldwide sales 
the company blamed part of the poor performance on higher tax 
rates and a sharp increase in expenditures linked to the planned 
introduction of a new instant camera line next month 
for the first three months of the year net income totaled 128 
million or 21 cents a share on sales of 4101 million that 
compared with earnings of 246 million or 40 cents a share and 
sales of 3811 million in 1987 
polaroid said profits from operations fell to 262 million for 
the period from 301 million during the first quarter last year 
polaroid spokesman samuel yanes said expenditures associated 
with the introduction of the impulse instant camera hurt earnings 
yanes said some of the first quarter costs involved marketing 
geared toward clearing inventory of existing cameras and promotion 
of the two impluse cameras scheduled to be introduced in stores 
nationwide on may 9 yanes said other expenditures included 
research and development 
the cameras unveiled to the media in new york earlier this 
month are listed to sell at 89 and 69 
the company also noted foreign currency exchange losses and a 30 
percent increase in worldwide tax payments compared with the first 
quarter of 1987 contributed to the profit and earnings decline

a general electric co stockholder is 
asking the companys shareholders to vote on refraining from 
support of any organizations that counsel or perform abortion 
the company whose annual meeting is wednesday in milwaukee 
says in its proxy statement that it recommends a vote against the 
proposal 
george jamison a spokesman for ge said the company doesnt 
knowingly support any organization that is pro or antiabortion 
the proposal is being offered in the name of anthony leschin of 
marshalltown iowa but he referred questions to his wife shirley 
who said she had nothing to say other than what is worded in the 
resolution 
the proposal said the the cumulative demographic facts of 
abortion on demand have now begun to impact on the american 
society 
it said abortions consequences include the closing of schools 
due to an absence of children the ongoing expansion of nursing 
care facilities of the elderly and the future lack of younger 
workers to sustain the social security system and the defense of 
our nation 
in the proxy statement ge said its board opposes this 
proposal because the company does not adopt positions unrelated to 
business interests the company has adopted no position on the 
abortion issue 
when asked if the company offers charitable contributions to 
groups on either side of the abortion issue jamison said not 
that we know of 
ned raynolds a senior vice president of the public relations 
firm hill and knowlton inc in new york said the antiabortion 
proposal reflects the basic phenomenon where people like to use 
the proxy machinery to express an opinion on something 
this woman has an antiabortion point of view apparently 
he said 
raynolds who said he has supervised studies of company annual 
reports said there are all kinds of things showing up on proxy 
statements ranging from experimental tests with animals to 
protesting south africa holdings 
shareholders of international business machines corp for 
instance defeated a resolution on monday that would have 
prohibited company benefit payments for abortions and related 
services and required management to disclose to shareholders any 
information about research and testing on animals 
nothing really surprises me in a proxy statement anymore 
raynolds said this is a trend documented in lots of places where 
institutions used to sell stock if they didnt like management but 
now they want to own stock and stay in but get their point of 
across

officials followed fronterhouses departure

and to recapitalize operations casey said in a statement monday

cnw corp and a new york investment firm have 
canceled a planned 578 million leveraged buyout of the 
chicagobased transportation and manufacturing company because of 
legal questions the company announced tuesday 
the investment banking firm gibbons green van amerongen and a 
cnw senior management group had offered 31 a share to acquire the

lawsuits with union workers who contend railroads have an 
obligation to bargain with their employees over the sale of local 
and regional routes foote said

gibbons green extended the closing date for the deal one month to 
may 31

of regional line sales the merger could not be consummated prior 
to the may 31 deadline james r wolfe cnws chairman and chief 
executive stated tuesday 
the board concluded that an extension of that deadline was not 
in the best interests of cnw shareholders wolfe said

cnw fell 1 to 2312 in trading tuesday on the new york stock
