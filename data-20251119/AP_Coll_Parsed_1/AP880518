six months after desperate cuban detainees took 
138 hostages and seized control of federal prisons in atlanta and 
oakdale la the government is paroling them in unprecedented 
numbers 
but the government program baffles some of the inmates and their 
lawyers they complain that the parole policy is incoherent and 
inconsistent quickly releasing scores of men yet keeping hundreds 
with sometimes minor criminal records behind bars without apparent 
reason 
according to the immigration and naturalization service 1093 
detainees have been freed since the uprisings compared with 92 
released in the six months preceding the riots ins officials deny 
the uprisings prompted the accelerated release policy 
in all since the riots ended in early december 2224 cubans 
have been recommended for release and 1208 have been deemed unfit 
for the streets said duke austin spokesman for the ins in 
washington twentyfour detainees have been marked for deportation 
and 300 more will have their fates decided in panel reviews by may 
31 
us attorney general edwin meese iii promised the full reviews 
as part of an agreement that ended the riots in which one atlanta 
detainee was killed and several others were injured none of the 
hostages was injured 
the 2400 men in detention at atlanta and oakdale last fall had 
committed crimes after arriving in this country from the cuban port 
of mariel in 1980 when fidel castro allowed 125000 cubans to 
leave 
at the time of the riots however the detainees had served 
their sentences and were being held indefinitely at the behest of 
the ins 
some had been held in this legal limbo for more than four years 
when they learned that the state department and cuba had 
reactivated a 1984 agreement for deportation of excludable 
immigrants 
the oakdale center erupted in flames on nov 21 the atlanta 
prison fell to the cubans two days later the justice department 
would later lay partial blame for the riots on the scant fourhour 
notice given prison officials by the state department 
the louisiana siege ended after eight days but atlantas 
uprising went on until dec 4 becoming one of the longest in 
federal prison history damage at the two prisons was estimated at 
64 million 
the prisons were shut down and the detainees some of whom 
insisted they would rather die than return to cuba were scattered 
to prisons across the country since then most of have been held 
in lockdown status confined to special seclusion areas 23 
hours a day 
they just sit in those cells waiting and getting depressed 
said linda serrano of atlanta whose commonlaw husband manuel 
casalis noy was approved for parole in november but has yet to be 
released 
despite the release statistics some advocates for the detainees 
including bishop augustin roman of miami who helped end the 
sieges maintain the government has not completely lived up to its 
promise 
the detainees arent being given full reviews theyre just 
being interviewed whats more the government doesnt even make an 
official record of these panel reviews something you must have if 
there is to be an effective appeal process said karen ellingson 
a legal aid attorney in minneapolis who has sat in on more than 70 
interviews conducted by the 20 twoperson ins review teams 
the pace of the reviews has stepped up since the riots detainee 
advocates say 
late last month us justice department spokesman patrick 
korten said the accelerated postriot releases reflected a more 
liberal parole policy however craig raynsford associate counsel 
at ins said i assure you these people are not being more 
favorably treated because they rioted 
he said the number of parolees has risen sharply because the 
review procedure implemented last june was slow and laborious and 
only recently began to bring about large numbers of releases 
theres a cumulative effect at work here he said our 
parole approval rate remains slightly above 60 percent the same as 
it was before the riots 
gary leshaw an attorney who works with the atlantabased 
coalition to support cuban detainees said his office is still 
swamped with calls for help more than 1100 men approved for 
release remain in prison for one reason or another such as a 
shortage of halfway houses or lack of sponsors he said 
supporters of the detainees note that prior to the riots all 
but about 20 of the releases were to halfway houses since 
december hundreds of detainees have been freed directly to their 
families and sponsors 
some detainees are being released right away almost pushed 
out onto the street while others including some who have good 
prison records and committed far less serious crimes remain behind 
bars for months said leshaw nobody seems to know whats going 
on 
although the 20 review teams might differ in style and approach 
raynsford said all look for the same thing in making 
recommendations whether the detainee is presently nonviolent 
and likely to stay that way whether he is likely to present a 
threat to the community and whether he is likely to violate his 
parole 
he also noted that a special appeals tier had been created for 
detainees who are turned down for parole even those who have been 
scheduled for repatriation to cuba can appeal 
but these are just paper appeals said ms ellingson you 
dont get to face your accusers besides its just another case of 
the ins which has been responsible for the incarceration of the 
detainees acting as their judge and jury 
she gave a recent experience as an example of why the process is 
so frustrating 
officials of dismas house a nonprofit facility in kansas 
city recently interviewed 45 detainees who had been approved for 
parole the halfway house took 18 of them and left the others 
stranded in prison not even knowing why they werent selected 
much less when they would be released 
asked why the director of dismas house the rev everett 
thornton said he had room for only 18 detainees we try and look 
for motivation thats the most important thing he said 
but ms ellingson said other factors are involved such as a 
detainees appearance and his ability to speak english things 
that really shouldnt matter that much 
even some detainees who have been released question the fairness 
of the ins process one of them is mario ochoa of brooklyn who was 
released in march just three weeks after his panel hearing 
i think i was released so quick because my wife went to 
washington several times and talked to congressmen and reporters 
about my case she really worked hard for me said ochoa who 
finished serving 26 months in 1986 for possession of a deadly 
weapon with intent to use it 
but he added im one of the lucky ones there are others 
still in lockdown who have good records and committed lesser crimes 
than i did i really cant figure out whats going on

the resurrection of the oakdale federal 
detention center is under way six months after it was nearly 
destroyed by rioting cubans and none too soon for many allen parish 
residents 
if it reopened tomorrow it would be six months too late 
said sandy strother a 25yearold resident of this south central 
louisiana town of 7200 
im ready for it to reopen she said in fact ive 
applied for a job there 
last nov 21 the 1000 cubans held here pending federal 
decision on their future went on a rampage at the news that some 
would be deported to their native land they burned 10 of the 14 
buildings at the 17 million center and took 28 guards hostage 
two days later cubans at the federal penitentiary in atlanta 
followed suit that uprising lasted until dec 4 while the siege 
at oakdale ended after eight days 
assistant warden art espinoza a 25year veteran of the us 
bureau of prisons arrived at the oakdale center the night before 
the cubans rioted 
ive been through riots but ive never been to a place before 
where they burned the place down espinoza said 
a pair of dormitories which escaped with only broken windows 
and some minor damage serve as temporary administration offices 
and housing for about 45 inmates maintaining the site 
inside bright white orange and yellow paint makes the 
dormitories nicer than those on some college campuses there are no 
steelgray cells with bars and wire mesh here 
if you would have walked in the first day after it was over 
you would never have believed people who lived here would have 
destroyed it as nice as it was espinoza said 
despite the destruction espinoza said he had no animosity 
toward the cubans inmates are inmates just because they burned 
the place down we cant say we dont want those types here he 
said 
a justice department report released earlier this month placed 
some of the blame for the oakdale and atlanta riots on prison 
officials it said they failed to recognize signs of impending 
trouble 
the report also said placing cubans at the oakdale facility a 
low to mediumsecurity alien processing center was a calculated 
risk 
espinoza said rebuilding the center will cost more than 13 
million and should be finished by oct 1 the prison should being 
taking new inmates by november 
oakdale mayor george mowad said hed been assured by federal 
officials that the prison would not again be home to a large group 
of a single type of illegals such as the cubans from the 1980 
mariel boatlift 
any concentration of cubans our people would be upset with 
mowad said the people of oakdale were very proud of that 
facility and then to go out and see it destroyed it was hard 
mowad says those worries arent enough to keep the town from 
eagerly anticipating the prisons reopening we had 100 percent 
support for it before it burned after the riot it dropped to about 
90 percent but weve got most of those people back 
after the oakdale center is rebuilt a second phase called 
oakdale ii is tentatively scheduled to open in november 1989 mowad 
said with both facilities operating the 500 federal jobs would 
make the detention center the citys no 1 employer 
each month since the riot oakdale has lost 6000 in water 
sewer and sales tax revenue mowad said 
a few reminders of the uprising remain the once landscaped 
grounds and paths at the prison now have patches of bare earth 
glaring in the sun 
in some areas not yet scrubbed and repainted slogans remain 
such as muertos no cuba death not cuba

these days a visitor can drive directly through 
wideopen iron gates and park within 20 yards of the us 
penitentiarys front steps 
those are the same steps descended by 89 hostages when they 
poured out of the prison last dec 4 ending an 11day uprising by 
more than 1100 cuban inmates 
the penitentiary then was less a prison than a badly damaged 
fortress under siege the front steps patrolled constantly by 
armed federal officers led to a building only partly controlled by 
authorities the rest was in the hands of cuban detainees who 
rioted at word of a deportation agreement with fidel castro 
when it was all over the prison was emptied of all inmates for 
the first time since it opened in 1902 and officials began cleaning 
up the damage officials estimated the damage here and in oakdale 
la where cuban inmates staged a similar uprising at 64 million 
now 600 inmates all americans are housed at the prison 
compared with about 200 americans and 1400 cuban inmates at the 
time of the takeover in two years the number is to reach 800 to 
850 so far there are no plans to bring cuban detainees to 
atlanta said mike caltabiano executive assistant to warden joseph 
petrovsky 
the riot interrupted a 63 million fiveyear renovation 
project but many of the areas damaged were to be razed in the 
renovation anyway caltabiano said 
the only real loss he said was the burnedout prison 
industries building 
a temporary industries unit has been set up in a former 
gymnasium there inmates repairing mailbags and making mattresses 
and meteorological parachutes earned 500000 for the prison in 
april caltabiano said 
a 20foothigh chain link fence is being erected to cut the 
prison almost in half behind it most of the construction will go 
on the first phase of the renovation project is to be completed 
next year 
elsewhere vandalism in the dining hall and chapel has been 
repaired 
its been the positive attitude of the staff thats made it 
by putting this kind of thing behind them and saying ok were 
going to see how we can rebuild atlanta caltabiano said 
the prison is atlanta or usp us penitentiary atlanta 
to its employees it was known as the big a to decades of 
inmates including the famous and the infamous 
at the dawn of the 1920s the big a was home to socialist 
presidential candidate eugene v debs who was imprisoned for a 
speech condemning war in world war i it held al capone in the 
1930s soviet spy rudolph able in the 1950s and mafia informant joe 
valachi in the 1960s 
in the late 1970s there were 16 slayings at the prison many 
described as professional hits related to drug sales by 1978 
a report by the us bureau of prisons suggested closing the 
penitentiary because its old design and deteriorating structures 
made security impossible 
the prison was to have been closed by the fall of 1984 
but the number of cuban inmates detained during the mariel 
boatlift because of their records in cuba or imprisoned later for 
offenses in the united states mounted 
violence again was a problem the bureau of prisons reported the 
atlanta pen had less than 10 percent of all federal prisoners but 
almost 20 percent of all assaults on inmates or guards 
the cubans frequently protested prison conditions but more often 
complained that they were being detained at all the final uprising 
was triggered by word that deportations to cuba would resume

linda serrano is philosophical when she talks 
about the bureaucracy of the us immigration and naturalization 
service but theres an underlying current of anger in her voice 
ive tried and tried to find out why they wont let manuel 
come home but so far nobody has explained it in a way that makes 
sense she said in an interview 
her commonlaw husband 46yearold manuel casalis noy an 
inmate at the federal prison in lompoc calif is one of some 
1100 cubans in federal detention who have been approved for parole 
but are still awaiting release 
jorge figueiras has been paroled but his wife reyna ordonez 
still fears he might be deported because of the damage done by the 
cubans during the uprisings last fall at prisons in atlanta and 
oakdale la 
the united states is not going to let this go by said 
ordonez some way i think theyll make them pay 
casalis noy arrived in this country in the 1980 mariel boatlift 
and later served eight months in a california prison for possession 
of cocaine when his time was up however the ins sent him to the 
federal penitentiary in atlanta where some 1400 other cubans with 
criminal records waited to learn what lay in store for them 
manuel was brought to atlanta in december 1985 and we came 
here from california three months later said serrano who lives 
with her two children from a previous relationship and works as a 
nannyhousekeeper for an atlanta family 
while trying to get paroled she said her husband worked in 
prison industries and kept out of trouble 
he was sending us money up to 100 a month there for a 
while she said and we could see him every week then last 
november he finally was approved for parole everything looked 
great i even had a job lined up for him 
then came the riots the cubans detained in atlanta and oakdale 
were moved to prisons throughout the country 
that messed everything up serrano said but when i 
finally tracked manuel down in late december i was told he was 
going to have to go to a halfway house somewhere 
serrano said she began trying to get her man sent home instead 
after numerous deadends she said she reached a bureau of prisons 
official working with the ins in washington dc 
she told me manuel couldnt come home because he was on the 
list to go a halfway house serrano said but i told her i had 
made a good home here and that i know a lot of detainees are being 
sent home and they did crimes a lot worse than manuel did besides 
theres a long wait to get into the halfway houses 
in the six months since the riots the ins has sent hundreds of 
detainees home some like mario ochoa were paroled within a few 
weeks of their interviews by a twoperson ins panel 
ochoa who served 26 months for possession of a dangerous weapon 
with intent to use it said he was released and sent home to 
brooklyn ny just three weeks after his interview 
he credited his quick release to his wifes contacts with 
congressmen and reporters 
he said he was puzzled that some cubans convicted of lesser 
crimes remain behind bars ins officials refuse to discuss the 
cases of individual detainees with reporters 
figueiras was transferred to a federal facility in kansas city 
kan after the riot he has since been released to a halfway house 
and now has his own apartment in a kansas city suburb his wife 
says 
figueiras must serve his eightmonth parole in the area ordonez 
has sent two of her children to be with him and says she will make 
the trip with her remaining two children when she saves enough 
money 
its good news that hes out but right now were going 
through hard times she said 
ordonez is the only one who remains of a small group of cuban 
women who had moved to oakdale to be near their husbands and 
relatives inside the prison 
the people here in oakdale they still dont like us she 
said my older kids they were always crying we want to leave 
here 
for me im still afraid she said the small children 
play together but i stay inside by myself 
if i had the money in my hand id be gone right now

fourteenyearold noorieh mazloumpoor 
has had two educations in her young life one moslem the other 
marxist 
she got her marxist education in her homeland afghanistan 
as a refugee with her family in pakistan for the past two years 
her education has been based on islam her religion 
she is typical of afghan children who have been taught two 
conflicting ideologies over the past decade of war in their country 
now with the soviet military withdrawal from afghanistan the 
children who have had an islamic education in pakistan will be 
returning home to join those whose education was wholly marxist 
the gap may be wide but students interviewed here were 
confident it wont deter them from reuniting their country in the 
long run 
noorieh went to school in kabul afghanistans capital until 
she was 12 
in pakistan she enrolled in a moslem school run by the 
guerrillas fighting the sovietbacked afghan government 
like many of her classmates she has had to switch from courses 
that taught communist doctrine to interpretations of the koran the 
moslem holy book 
in kabul she said she was taught that it was her duty to 
serve the country the masses the revolution and the fruits of 
history 
at her refugee school in peshawar the blue cover of her persian 
language text book has a map identifying her country as moslem 
afghanistan another map in the book carries the koranic verse 
there is no god but allah mohammed is his prophet 
refugee books published by the guerrillas afghan education 
council also teach the future of afghanistan should be 
reconstructed on the principles of islamic culture 
eventually we will have to reconcile the two said 
ehsanollah poopal 17yearold 10th grader 
its going to take a lot of effort patience they have their 
reasons and we have ours 
poopal however said he will not accept the communist teachings 
and will try to explain to his classmates back home why his beliefs 
are different 
another refugee student 15yearold mehrafsa said he thinks it 
is going to be difficult in the beginning 
we are going to suffer first especially to see our friends 
are led toward a corrupt path taught bad values but i dont think 
it will be too long before we understand each other i dont think 
the gap will affect the country in the long run 
wassimeh 24 a teacher at one of the refugee schools believes 
moslem education will continue when the children among the 3 
million refugees in pakistan return home 
maliheh malekzad 28 an mathematics teacher said she taught at 
a kabul school until two years ago she added that unless a teacher 
was a member of the communist party there was no hope of promotion 
it is very difficult for a moslem not to be able to express 
her religious viewpoint and to be taunted for her belief she 
said 
schools in afghanistan according to the teachers and students 
here have their own party recruitment bodies the scouts the 
first stage of communist indoctrination and the youth 
organization where russian culture and language are taught and 
where some are given schoolarships to study in the soviet union 
the third stage is the older youth organization where advanced 
communist books are read outside the school curriculum 
ms malekzad said the refugee schools here are good at teaching 
theories but poor in practical education 
the walls and classrooms are adorned with guerrilla posters and 
during class the students sing i cry for my motherland i cry 
for its martyr wherever i turn i see broken limbs 
but 9yearold godsiyeh amir mohammad said she likes studying 
islam because it will make me go to heaven

five months of palestinian strikes and boycotts 
have cost israel 500 million in lost tourist income uncollected 
taxes and added military expenses officials say 
but israeli analysts suggest the 15 million arab residents of 
the west bank and gaza strip have suffered even more because they 
depend on israel for jobs and services 
gad yaacobi minister of economy estimated the loss between 
500 million to 560 million according to his spokeswoman naama 
henig 
riots stayathome strikes refusal to pay taxes and a boycott 
of israeli products have left their greatest mark on tourism which 
brought in 16 billion last year 
the major damage is to the tourism industry the estimate is 
there will be a drop of several hundred million dollars in income 
due to the image of israel as a result of the uprising said 
assaf razin professor of economy at tel aviv university 
tourism in march and april was down 23 percent from the first 
two months of the year and advance bookings have fallen this is a 
huge disappointment for officials who had hoped to reap a tourist 
bonanza on israels 40th anniversary 
to counter its bad image israel will spend 5 million on an 
advertising campaign under the slogan israel see for yourself 
the idea is israel isnt just the west bank its masada 
eilat jaffa oranges all these wonderful things said al 
lieberman president of new yorkbased grey advertising one of the 
companies involved in the campaign 
half the total cost has been putting additional manpower in the 
field to handle the riots 
the ceiling on reserve army duty was raised from 45 to 62 days 
per year razin said the government will have to pay 100 million 
to reserve soldiers who are compensated for missing work 
yaacobi said the army spent 250 million for riot control and 
the police 94 million he indicated this could weaken israels 
defense posture 
it is clear that we will not be able to absorb for long sums 
of hundreds of millions of shekels without this badly damaging the 
readiness of both the forces yaacobi said on army radio 
razin said the uprising that began dec 8 known as the 
intefadeh has not had the same economic impact as israels 
threeyear lebanon occupation which cost 16 billion to 2 
billion and fueled runaway inflation of more than 400 percent 
the economic aspects of the intefadeh have not been that 
devastating or costly enough visibly to change israeli attitudes 
razin said in an interview 
eitan berglas chairman of the bank hapoalim which is 
affiliated with israels labor movement said the loss to israels 
economy this year would be be 15 percent to 2 percent of the gross 
national product of 25 billion 
berglas said the rising costs of governing the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip could affect israeli thinking about the need to 
keep the land seized in the 1967 middle east war 
if israelis are persuaded there will be no return to the 
situation as it was before the uprising and if big expenditures 
continue it may convince people of the need to compromise about 
the territories he said 
but berglas said the question was whether the economic burden 
would have an impact before november when national elections are 
scheduled 
in recent years israel has been profiting financially from 
trade with the occupied territories in 1987 the surplus was 491 
million 
also declining are tax collections that fund the armyrun civil 
administration which governs the west bank and gaza strip 
its starting to be significant we have a shortage of 
money said a senior official in the civil administration which 
runs schools hospitals and utilities in the occupied lands 
we are trying to protect the most vital services such as 
hospitals but a shortage of money means a shortage of service 
said the official who demanded anonymity 
to collect taxes which fund the civil administrations 320 
million budget the army has set up surprise checkpoints on the 
highways in the west bank and gaza 
soldiers use portable computers to check whether motorists have 
paid taxes palestinian journalists say some cars trucks and cargo 
have been seized if taxes have not been paid 
an army economist in the civil administration predicted the 14 
billion gnp of the west bank and gaza strip would decline by as 
much as 100 million if the unrest continued razin predicted the 
loss could be several hundred million 
in terms of relative magnitude theres a very big impact in 
the territories while on the israeli side it is manageable said 
razin 
the greatest impact has been on the 110000 arabs laborers who 
hold jobs in israel about 20 percent have been kept off the job 
and others have lost income because of plocalled general strikes 
or armyimposed curfews 
the fact is the palestinian worker needs israel more than 
israel needs him said the army economist who demanded anonymity

the surprise reconciliation between 
morocco and algeria ending more than 12 years of often bloody 
hostility is expected to help next months arab summit and further 
the cause of north african unity 
a communique issued simultaneously in rabat and algiers on 
monday announced the decision to reestablish full diplomatic 
relations immediately and to reactivate all past agreements 
including a 19yearold treaty of friendship and cooperation 
transport and communications links between the two countries are 
to be restored without delay 
the communique stressed the determination of the two north 
african arab neighbors to cooperate toward maghreb or north 
african unity and toward solving all bilateral and regional 
problems including the dispute over the western sahara which has 
repeatedly brought them to the brink of war 
the announcement followed months of secret highlevel diplomatic 
contacts between the two governments and strong pressure from other 
arab countries to put an end to their dispute 
the joint communique said nothing about the concessions believed 
to have been made by the two sides concerning the western sahara 
the root of their quarrel 
morocco annexed western sahara a former spanish colony in 
1975 it was algerias military financial logistic and diplomatic 
support for a guerrilla group in the territory the polisario 
front that led to the break in relations in march 1976 
hours before the communique was issued polisarios algiers 
headquarters claimed the guerrillas had launched an attack on 
moroccan troops in the desert and killed 20 of them morocco 
refused to confirm or deny the report 
in its first comment on the reconciliation the polisario front 
said it was determined to pursue its legitimate struggle for the 
conquest of sovereignty over all its national territory 
the statement said the guerrilla group approved any move toward 
lessening tension and creating the greater maghreb but added 
the only just and definitive solution is the recognition of 
the national rights of the saharan state 
algeria had hitherto insisted that relations could only be 
restored between the two governments after morocco agreed to open 
direct talks with the polisario leadership 
but king hassan consistently rejected such talks on the grounds 
that this would prejudge the result of a proposed referendum in the 
disputed territory 
polisario for its part has insisted the 160000 moroccan 
troops and administrators be replaced by an international 
peacekeeping force prior to any vote 
tuesday marked the third day of a major feast ending the moslem 
holy month of ramadan and most senior officials were unreachable 
in both countries 
the moroccan government paper le matin du sahara sought to 
dispel speculation that algeria agreed to resume relations only to 
ensure the participation of king hassan ii of morocco in the arab 
summit meeting scheduled to begin june 7 in algiers 
king hassan said earlier he would not attend the summit while 
morocco had no diplomatic relations with algeria 
the resumption of diplomatic relations is far from a simple 
arrangement of convenience on the eve of an arab summit the 
paper said the creation of a greater maghreb is a vital 
necessity for the arab and african peoples 
arab league secretary general chedli klibi hailed the 
reconciliation tuesday and said that in the immediate your 
decision will have a positive effect on the summit 
in washington the state department hailed the renewed 
diplomatic links 
its a positive step for both countries and for the north 
africa region said state department spokesman charles redman 
the restoration of relations between algeria and morocco removed 
the greatest obstacle preventing further north african unity 
however and the joint communique said this was the objective of 
both governments 
algeria is linked in a regional friendship and cooperation 
treaty to tunisia and mauritania each of the three countries has a 
veto over the possible extension of the treaty and tunisia has 
long blocked algerian efforts to include libya because such action 
would leave morocco isolated in north africa 
although the joint communique gave no hint of progress toward a 
solution of the western sahara dispute it seemed to open the way 
to the possible fivenation north african community that has long 
been a professed goal of all the governments involved

kaye ballards singing is tuneful and can sound 
deeply felt tender and poignant but in her new offbroadway show 
she emphasizes her talent to amuse and thats rarer than the 
ability to sing 
there are jokes and impressions scattered through kaye 
ballard working 42nd street at last which opened on that 
streets the kaufman theater monday night but she dived in at the 
beginning with funny songs 
dont ask the lady what the lady did before the opener by 
composer cy coleman has witty double entendre lyrics by carolyn 
leigh miss ballard followed that with sondheim song which 
announces that she wont sing a new york cabaret acts obligatory 
song by stephen sondheim whilst quoting liberally from sondheim 
she immediately plunged several levels of sophistication by 
singing in praise of my son whos a stripper and burger 
beguine which lists fastfood joints from the champs elysees to 
the apian way 
kidding aside miss ballard also sang some lovely songs 
including jerome kerns remind me a tastefully chosen medley 
of irving berlin songs sung with a throb and a beautiful tone and 
a very occasional big ending yellow flower on which she 
surprised by playing flute and young at heart sung with sweet 
gentleness 
the audience resumed laughing as she trashed is that all there 
is pushed her nose down with her finger to act out i just 
kissed my nose goodnight and let cole porters tale of the 
oyster reveal its own wit without overselling it 
arthur siegel who composed several songs for broadways new 
faces of 1952 played piano for miss ballard and sang several 
duets with her he also soloed on his own love is a simple 
thing 
all cabaret shows seek to lift listeners on wings of song miss 
ballards also lifts one with laughter

us postal inspectors arrested 10 employees for 
drug trafficking through the dallas main post office tuesday night 
following a ninemonth undercover investigation 
postal inspector jim travell said authorities are still looking 
for two more employees who were indicted for selling and 
distributing marijuana and cocaine at the postal processing center 
the indictments were handed down by a dallas grand jury and 
charged each postal worker with selling drugs to agents who worked 
in an undercover capacity at the facility said travell of fort 
worth 
sealed indictments were handed down april 28 travell said but 
they were not unsealed until tuesday to allow authorities time to 
organize the arrests 
those arrested are mail handlers or processors and distribution 
clerks who worked two evening shifts processing mail through the 
dallas facility travell said 
they worked different shifts and we have no reason to believe 
there was a conspiracy between them travell said 
the employees who have one to 10 years experience with the 
postal service were arrested for selling between a quarterounce 
to several pounds of marijuana or between a halfgram to a 
quarterounce of cocaine in any one sale to the undercover 
officers travell said 
the largest sale we did was 1000 travell said most of 
them ranged from 25 to 1000 a sale the jist of the 
investigation was dealers not users 
assistant us attorney bob webster of dallas said the employees 
face pentalties of 5 years to 15 years in prison and fines of 
150000 to 200000 
travell said inspectors were alerted to a drug trafficking 
problem among the 4000 workers at the facility by employees 
fellow employees are starting to be fedup with this type of 
behavior travell said

an atlanta ballet dancer recuperating from an 
accidental stabbing during a performance of romeo and juliet 
said he still believes real swords and knives should be used in the 
production 
you need it for effect said richard mcleod it makes you 
pay attention a lot more because you realize there is that element 
of danger and if you dont do what youre supposed to do you 
could get hurt 
ballet officials also defended the use of real weapons but said 
they would not try to repeat the stabbing stunt that left mcleod 
with a punctured lung during friday nights performance 
a protective shield had been sewn into mcleods costume so he 
could be dramatically stabbed in the back with a 3inch serrated 
knife but the shield had shifted out of place 
usually dancer george prieto stabs me and leaves the knife 
in there but he said he felt something was wrong and he pulled it 
back out and i fell on the ground said the 20yearold mcleod 
who is recovering at georgia baptist hospital 
atlanta ballet president kenneth t hertz said the clinking and 
scraping of real swords is a vital part of a major league 
production 
theres nothing that can really duplicate that sound he 
said the performers can really go at it a little bit more 
strongly because its equipment that was designed for that not 
equipment that was designed to look like it was designed for that 
robert barnett artistic director of the ballet company said it 
is commonplace for dancers to use real swords but he said of the 
stabbing scene during the ballet by sergei prokofiev well never 
do that sort of action again because its just not worth taking 
the chance 
tom pazik who choreographed the production said he will change 
the stabbing scene if he stages the ballet again probably using a 
retractable blade

senior leader deng xiaoping today told president 
joaquim alberto chissano of mozambique that china went through a 
20year period of stagnation before leftist mistakes were corrected 
in the late 1970s 
deng 83 in opening remarks to chissano said chinas troubles 
began in 1957 the year mao tsetung launched a repressive 
antirightist movement and the great leap forward a disastrous 
experiment in rapid industrialization

revolution when the nation was torn apart by purges and violent 
battles between rival leftist groups

to power in the late 1970s he has introduced pragmatic political

almost everybody had an opinion usually a 
vehement one about the baby m case in which mary beth 
whiteheadgould reneged on her promise to give william and 
elizabeth stern the baby she bore as a surrogate mother 
the case was decided only last year and its already a 
madefortelevision movie airing sunday and monday on abc the 
fourhour docudrama is based on court transcripts and published 
accounts of the landmark case and is remarkably fairminded 
considering the emotionally volatile subject it was written and 
directed by james sadwith bluffing it 
jobeth williams is perfect as mary beth a new jersey mother of 
two married to a garbage collector rick whitehead is played as a 
sturdy loyal saltoftheearth type by bruce weitz 
when mary beth decides seemingly selflessly that shed like to 
help an infertile couple she is introduced to the welleducated 
welloff sterns he a biochemist played by john shea she a 
pediatrician played by robin strasser 
for those familiar with the case it may be difficult to watch 
the two couples waltzing merrily into what will become an 
unbearable situation at one point the sterns are offered the 
opportunity to remain anonymous but they insist on meeting mary 
beth and they even socialize with the whiteheads 
if the miniseries falls to one side or the other it is to mary 
beths especially in the first half when she screams all night for 
the child she has been forced to give away 
william stern who frequently whines that he has no one 
must rely for sympathy on sheas portrayal and it works because 
no one could despise those cocker spaniel eyes but the movie does 
show stern to be caring enough to give the baby back temporarily 
he believes when mary beth appears so distraught he thinks she 
might commit suicide for her part elizabeth stern comes off every 
bit the ice princess mary beth calls her 
mary beth drags her husband and the couples two children along 
on her emotional roller coaster she and rick flee in a vain effort 
to keep the baby mary beth has named sara the filmmakers set some 
scenes to the starship song sara sara sara storms are 
brewin in your eyes sara sara no time is a good time for 
goodbye 
the sterns go to court to get the baby back the judge seals the 
case to shield the child from publicity and notoriety little 
did he know it would become a network miniseries 
mary beth finally calls bill stern from the road and says she 
wants to resolve the situation but she also threatens to kill 
herself and the baby stern unbeknown to her is taping the call 
and it will become a bombshell in the trial to come 
the pawn in all of this is of course the infant andthe film 
makes that point in one poignant scene as rick and a sheriffs 
deputy grapple for the child as the camera captures her terrified 
expression 
the second half of the movie is taken up with the court battle 
in one of the odd bit parts he seems to like dabney coleman plays 
the sterns lawyer anne jackson has a small part too as the 
attorney appointed to represent the child 
at the trial mary beths duplicity and instability are 
revealed and betsy stern it is learned is not infertile though 
she faced the risk of aggravating her multiple sclerosis if she 
became pregnant 
stern makes some vague protests about fathers rights but 
it is mary beths lawyer played by bruce mcgill who gets the big 
speech 
i tell this court he says there is nothing more 
fundamentally repugnant than to permit a man to have one woman to 
share his life and another to experience the sacrifice and pain of 
pregnancy and a lifetime of suffering as a result of separation 
from her child it will always be the wife of the sanitation worker 
who will bear children for the pediatrician 
the movie ends with the judge giving custody of baby m to the 
sterns a scroll updates with the results of the appeal the new 
jersey supreme court ruled the surrogacy contract illegal the 
sterns have custody of the baby they named melissa but mary beth 
now married to another man and mother of their newborn son has 
visitation rights 
the big question has always been how melissa stern will feel 
about all this when shes old enough to understand it its a 
tribute to sadwith and crew that this movie would give her a pretty 
good idea of how adults good intentions can go wrong and how 
much they all loved a baby girl

smoke inhalation said yabuno he said 28 of the injured were taken 
to hospitals and the seven others were treated at the port area for 
minor burns or bruises

workers visiting japan on a tour organized by the communist youth 
league 
the ship was carrying 295 passengers and 129 crew members when 
it arrived tuesday at osaka 255 miles west of tokyo kataoka said 
firefighters temporarily stopped battling the blaze at one point 
because water pumped into the lower decks had caused the ship to 
list the extra water was removed 
police cordoned off the area and ambulences sped to the dock 
the priamurye left vladivostok on may 7 and made stops at otaru 
on japans northern island of hokkaido and in tokyo on thursday

soviet consular officials took most passengers to a junior high 
school gymnasium 
the worst ship disaster in recent years involving a soviet 
cruise vessel occurred on aug 31 1986 when the admiral nakhimov 
sank in the black sea after colliding with the freighter pyotr 
vasyev with the loss of 398 lives 
both captains were sentenced to 15year prison terms 
on feb 16 1986 the 20000ton soviet cruise liner mikhail 
lermonov slammed into rocks off new zealand and sank but although 
the liner was carrying more than 700 passengers and crew there was 
only one fatality a soviet crew member

the united states and israel are negotiating a 
settlement after a twoyear investigation into allegations israel 
tried to acquire us technology illegally for cluster bombs us 
officials say 
we will not prosecute criminally justice department 
spokesman john russell said tuesday we are in negotiations with 
israel he said 
because the case is still open russell would not comment on why 
the department has decided to forgo criminal prosecution he also 
refused to divulge the nature of the negotiations 
but an official of the us customs service speaking on 
condition he not be named said this week there was a proposal to 
issue administrative sanctions against israel possibly civil fines 
an official at the israeli embassy did not return a telephone 
call to discuss the case 
the probe centered on allegations that israel tried to obtain 
from private american contractors the technology to produce cluster 
bombs which are canisters containing hundreds of smaller 
highexplosive bomblets 
the united states banned the export of cluster bombs to israel 
in 1982 after reports that israel had used them in the invasion of 
lebanon violating the stipulation that israel use the bombs only 
for selfdefense 
specifically investigators sought to determine if there were 
any violations of the arms export control act which stipulates 
that certain military items can only be exported from the united 
states with a license 
us officials said israelis had approached vector corp of 
marion iowa with the proposal that the companys description of 
technology be relabeled so it would not appear to be used in 
producing explosive devices 
vectors highspeed machinery compresses and seals the hundreds 
of little bombs in cluster bombs 
israeli officials denied any violations had occurred they said 
they developed their own minibombs placed in artillery shells 
and any american technology had been imported with valid licenses 
they said 
in july 1986 subpoenas and search warrants were served at 
israel military industries in new york whose 200 employees 
negotiate military contracts with us companies in spending 18 
billion in military aid grants 
the justice department withdrew the subpoenas after the israeli 
government said some of the officials were covered by diplomatic 
immunity in exchange the israelis agreed to cooperate with the 
investigation 
subpoenas were also served on vector corp bexco international 
of cedar rapids iowa and assembly machines inc of erie pa 
grand juries were impaneled in erie and cedar rapids 
dan schwartz a lawyer for vector said he had no information 
about the justice departments negotiations we have received no 
word for a fairly long period of time he said 
officials at assembly machines a manufacturing company and 
bexco an exportimport firm also said they had no information 
about the case

a new agriculture department report says there 
have been some dramatic changes in the mix of foods consumed by 
americans since 1970 but some inconsistencies too 
of all the meat consumed in 1986 twothirds was red meat 
mostly beef pork and lamb compared with threefourths in the 
early 1970s 
instead we ate more poultry fish grains and cereal 
products the report said tuesday we also cut back on whole 
milk while consuming more lowfat milk and yogurt fresh fruit and 
vegetable consumption rose as well 
but the report added while there was a general shift toward 
foods perceived as low in fat or calories our cheese consumption 
increased during the period in addition consumption rose for fats 
and oils frozen potatoes and corn sweeteners and soft drinks 
and families ate fewer eggs and fresh potatoes and drank less 
coffee during the 16year period 
overall the consumers responded to higher incomes new food 
production and marketing techniques and changes in lifestyles 
consumption of red meat declined but poultry more than took up 
the slack total meat consumption which includes poultry 
gradually crept higher 
the report was prepared by a team in the departments economic 
research service and was included in the agencys quarterly 
national food review 
in the early 70s the report said americans ate an average of 
151 pounds of red meat annually per person and about 49 pounds of 
poultry in 1986 red meat dropped to 140 pounds while poultry 
averaged 72 pounds 
poultrys rise stemmed largely from retail prices that 
remained well below those for red meats primarily because of 
savings passed on from the farm and processing levels the report 
said as a result poultry was used to a greater extent in frozen 
entrees and convenience foods than red meats were 
but poultrys price advantage was not the only factor that 
affected consumers cutup birds and heavily advertised branded 
items such as those of holly farms perdue louis rich and tysons 
foods gained popularity 
panready or precooked items along with upscale raw products 
such as boneless breast fillets also attracted consumers 
processors began offering chicken and turkey franks turkey 
breakfast sausages and turkey ham and salami in an effort to cater 
to consumer concerns about fat 
other food processors and retailers joined the move toward 
valueadded items the report said dairy processors introduced 
fresh and microwave pizzas a variety of flavored and textured 
yogurts mexicanflavored cheeses fruit and onionflavored cream 
cheeses upscale frozen dairy products and readytomake quiche 
mixtures 
frozen vegetable processors developed new combinations sauce 
selections and singleserving products in microwave containers and 
supermarkets now have a wider variety of fresh produce than they 
had in the 70s and have become more convenenience oriented with 
salad bars and soup kettles

president reagans decision to pursue an 
ambitious space shield against nuclear weapons came despite his own 
top advisers belief that the star wars system wouldnt work says 
former national security adviser robert c mcfarlane 
mcfarlane giving his first public account of the origins of 
reagans strategic defense initiative told a congressional 
committee tuesday that the president apparently came up with the 
idea on his own against the advice of mcfarlane and other top 
military officials 
the idea that any technological system could so devalue the 
nuclear threat from additional and more accurate soviet 
intercontinental missiles as to produce a nonuclear world is 
infeasible he told the house armed services committee 
but mcfarlane said the idea already has served the purpose he 
originally saw for it forcing the soviets to reconsider their 
offensive missile buildup and to add to the pressures that brought 
perestroika mikhail s gorbachevs restructuring of the soviet 
economy 
mcfarlane later told a reporter he had chosen to speak out on 
the subject after remaining silent for five years because ive 
become more despairing about the responsiveness of government to 
people and its not going to get better until we put aside the 
notion that the american people are too dumb to understand 
he said he feels guilty as a member of a community that 
has not been very candid with the american people about their 
safety 
mcfarlane said he directed the military joint chiefs of staff in 
late 1982 to develop the idea of using us technological 
superiority for some kind of antimissile defense the idea was 
to demonstrate to the soviet union that we intended to redirect 
our investment strategy to an area where we had the comparative 
advantage he said 
the military chiefs came up with a proposal for a limited 
groundbased system mcfarlane said but reagan turned that limited 
concept into a much more ambitious system which mcfarlane had 
recommended against 
he said the president had been thoroughly briefed on the 
problems of such a system the risks of technical failure the 
suspicions that would be aroused among allies that the united 
states was seeking only its own security soviet suspicions of us 
preparation for a first nuclear strike and the fiscal 
extravagance involved 
my approach was one based on a rather sober conservative 
judgment about technological risk fiscal realities and traditional 
allied strategy he said in a brief interview i was paid to 
deal in the real world presidents are paid to inspire to lead to 
have a vision that goes beyond the status quo 
when reagan announced his idea for a spacebased missile shield 
in a march 1983 speech members of the military establishment 
including thendefense secretary caspar weinberger and the joint 
chiefs of staff were flabbergasted because it so differed from 
anything previously discussed 
mcfarlane who now is at work on a book while at georgetown 
universitys center for strategic and international studies said 
the original idea for a defense system came in late 1982 from adm 
james watkins then chief of naval operations 
the president never directed me to develop an sdi program 
mcfarlane said i never heard from anyone in the white house 
the guidance to do this although he was aware reagan had some 
interest in antiballistic missile defense dating from before his 
1980 election 
in late 1982 the administration had lost several battles in 
congress over what kind of basing mode to use in deploying the mx 
missile and was concerned that the united states was losing ground 
to the soviets in offensive weapons he said 
adm john m poindexter then a national security council 
deputy came to him with watkins idea and mcfarlane told the 
joint chiefs to develop the idea further he said the chiefs met 
several times in january 1983 then at a feb 11 meeting summarized 
their findings in a meeting with reagan 
the president interrupted and said are you telling me that 
you believe as a body that we should consider whether defense could 
make a greater contribution to the strategic balance and each 
in turn answered yes mcfarlane recounted 
but the military was talking about missiles mcfarlane said 
how did that get changed into an astrodome to protect the 
population asked committee chairman les aspin dwis 
basically the president wanted to change it mr chairman 
mcfarlane answered he said you must deal in the traditional 
threat we have faced and in military terms my job is to lead and 
to try to evaluate what may be feasible technologically and be 
responsive to human beings i dont fault him for it 
estimates of the longterm cost of reagans spacebased defense 
which could use a combination of orbiting satellites space fired 
rockets and laser beams to knock out soviet missiles range up to 
as much as 1 trillion some 25 billion in research and 
development money already has been approved deployment of a 
rudimentary version to protect a few limited military targets is 
envisioned as early as the mid 1990s

legislation to overhaul the federal 
governments minority business development program is moving 
through congress in response to the wedtech bribery and 
influencepeddling scandal 
the measure approved tuesday by the senate small business 
committee is intended to insulate the program from the political 
hijinks which have plagued it over the years said committee 
chairman dale bumpers dark 
we dont want any more wedtech scandals he said 
bumpers cited the numerous bribery and influencepeddling 
indictments stemming from the wedtech corps successful attempts 
to win nobid contracts from the reagan administration 
the committee approved a fiscal 1989 reauthorization of small 
business administration programs at approximately the same funding 
level as this year 53 billion with inflationary increases for 
sba salaries and expenses 
but it also voted to change the rules under which certain 
government procurement contracts are set aside for companies owned 
and controlled by women and members of minority groups 
since there is no competitive bidding the program has come 
under sharp criticism and public scrutiny because of the wedtech 
case and other scandals 
the senate measure requires that companies show that 30 percent 
of their business comes from competitive contracts outside the 
program after five years to be eligible for new contracts in the 
sixth year the percentage remains the same in year six but 
increases to 50 percent for the seventh and eighth years of 
participation a house version of the bill also calls for a varying 
mix of competitive contracts but only recommends that they be goals 
and not requirements 
both versions provide that contracts can be terminated by the 
government if the business is quickly transferred or sold the 
senate bill applies that provision to the initial year of the 
contract 
the committee also approved amendments requiring a yearly 
certification of ownership among the allegations in the wedtech 
case is that the company continued to seek the preferential sba 
contracts even though it was no longer minoritycontrolled 
wedtech a south bronx military contractor was awarded more 
than 250 million in nobid contracts in just four years it was 
frequently cited by reagan administration officials as a minority 
business success story but the bribery and influencepeddling 
allegations subsequently led to five different state and federal 
criminal investigations 
among those under indictment is e robert wallach a longtime 
friend of attorney general edwin meese iii meese has acknowledged 
interceding on wedtechs behalf on a nobid army contract but he 
denies any wrongdoing

us officials say kremlin leader mikhail s 
gorbachev may withdraw 50000 to 100000 troops from eastern europe 
this year in a bid to win support for a new round of eastwest 
negotiations on conventional forces 
a unilateral soviet withdrawal of that scale would have little 
impact strategically said a us official but the political 
payoff could be immense in western europe where polls show great 
enthusiasm for gorbachevs foreign and domestic policies 
us officials trying to anticipate gorbachevs summit strategy 
have also detected hints that he will suggest a fifth summit 
meeting before reagan leaves office in eight months the projected 
sites are vienna or budapest 
another summit would give the two sides more time to work on a 
treaty to cut their strategic nuclear weapon arsenals by 30 to 50 
percent 
secretary of state george p shultz acknowledged after making 
final summit preparations last week in geneva with soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze that it is now clear there is no 
way these questions can be shaped up in treaty form in time for the 
summit in moscow may 29june 2 
the two sides however may use the moscow summit to sign one 
protocol of the proposed strategic arms reduction treaty a 
provision under which each side would notify the other of the time 
place and intended target of any planned missile tests including 
those from submarines said one us official 
because no major agreements are to be signed at the summit us 
officials who spoke only on condition of anonymity said they 
foresee it as an event to consolidate improvements in ussoviet 
relations since gorbachev took office in 1985 and began the summit 
meetings 
at the same time us officials were preparing for possible 
surprises 
at reykjavik in 1986 gorbachev seized the initiative with 
sweeping proposals to slash nuclear weapons 
this time some us officials said gorbachev may propose a 25 
percent reduction in ground forces in europe and opening 
negotiations in vienna in late fall 
pentagon and other estimates of nato and warsaw pact troop 
strengths vary widely from a 900000man edge for the east to a 
200000 western edge 
the warsaw pact has a decided lead in tanks and artillery the 
pentagon estimates the sovietled alliance has 52000 tanks 
compared to 20000 in nato and 43000 artillery pieces compared to 
natos 18000 
the soviets keep 380000 of their armored and motorized ground 
troops at a high state of readiness in east germany 80000 in 
czechoslovakia and 40000 in poland acording to the londonbased 
institute for international strategic studies 
other us officials said gorbachev might postpone any 
initiatives until after the moscow summit and afterwards cut troop 
levels unilaterally 
one us official predicted 50000 to 70000 soviet troops might 
be withdrawn another us official said as many as 100000 red 
army troops could be pulled back both officials spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
another veteran observer former defense secretary harold brown 
forecast that gorbachev might try to throw reagan off balance at 
the moscow summit by announcing a unilateral withdrawal 
brown told reporters he would not be surprised if the soviets 
move spectacularly on the conventional arms control front 
gorbachev and his warsaw pact allies have been urging for two 
years that the united states and the 15 other nations in the north 
atlantic treaty organization began a new round of talks on 
conventional arms 
the earlier mutual balanced force reduction talks which began 
in 1973 failed to produce agreement even on the number of troops 
in the opposing forces 
reagan administration officials believe a breakthrough may be 
possible because gorbachev seems to have accepted the western 
argument that the warsaw pact must make larger cuts than nato to 
redress its geographic and numerical advantages 
the soviets can afford to take significant cuts without 
hurting their military capability one us official said the 
first us objective is to get the soviets down to nato levels 
the kremlin has also showed signs of addressing western concerns 
that the soviet union did not meet the human rights pledges it made 
in the 1975 helsinki accord 
senior us officials said shevardnadze told shultz in geneva 
that his government would soon change its policies on religious 
practices and religious education although he did not offer any 
details his statement was taken seriously by the us side

even good economic news doesnt seem to cheer 
people up these days and that could prove to be bad news for vice 
president george bush 
the latest example came tuesday when the stock market declined 
sharply after receiving news of a substantial improvement in the 
latest trade figures 
that bearish response to good tidings was enough to make bush 
wonder what it will take to get a favorable political bounce out of 
an expanding economy 
we have an economic situation any incumbent ought to just 
dream about having said eddie mahe a republican political 
consultant not involved in any presidential campaign 
but at the same time he said national polls are recording a 
sense of unease a sense that its time for a change 
consider the trade figures the government reported that in 
march the trade deficit dropped more than 4 billion as exports 
increased by 23 percent 
when trade figures a month earlier showed an increase in the 
deficit the market dropped 101 points demonstrating the 
readiness of investors to believe the worst it was a disappointing 
deficit report that triggered the 500point market drop last 
october 
yet the reaction on wall street to good news on the trade front 
was a drop of 21 points in the dow jones average of 30 industrial 
stocks 
the same day the new trade figures came out a cbs newsnew york 
times poll said democrat michael dukakis was leading bush by 10 
points in a national survey of 1056 registered voters a poll two 
months earlier had the two candidates in a dead heat with bush 
favored by 46 percent and dukakis by 45 percent 
it certainly wasnt the economy that went sour for bush in the 
period between those surveys 
consider the recent statistics 
the unemployment rate in april was 54 percent the lowest 
since june 1974 
business sales climbed 19 percent in march and construction 
spending climbed 15 percent the biggest increases in both areas 
in a year 
even with recent increases in energy prices the inflation 
rate remains below 5 percent 
bush tried to brush off the latest poll by comparing it to 
surveys that showed him running behind in new hampshire just before 
last winters republican primary 
i was 8 points back and i won by 10 he told reporters in 
california they were off by 18 points 
i dont worry about it the election is 5 months away he 
said 
but of course he worries about such statistics any politician 
would 
one theory common among republican and democratic political 
analysts is that the administrations economic story is being 
obscured by the attention received by the trials and tribulations 
of attorney general edwin meese iii and by public concern over 
whether panamanian strongman manuel antonio noriega will be let off 
the hook on drug charges 
when bush was asked if he thought the meese and noriega affairs 
were contributing to his negative ratings in the polls the vice 
president replied you may have put your finger on something 
there 
but before going too far with the poll figures it must be said 
that such numbers six months before the election are not reliable 
indicators of how people will vote in november 
they are just a warning to bush that things arent going his way 
at this early stage of the contest 
they also reflect that because the race for the republican 
presidential nomination ended early dukakis has been much more in 
the public eye for the past six weeks 
week after week the massachusetts governor is portrayed as the 
victor over jesse jackson in yet another democratic primary 
as one gop analyst speaking on condition of anonymity put it 
every time dukakis wins another primary he grows an inch 
at the same time bush is coasting unopposed through those same 
primaries his victories getting only perfunctory notice from a 
public knowing the suspense went out of the gop race on super 
tuesday 
democratic pollster peter hart said bush is suffering because on 
the republican side there wasnt enough of a campaign so there 
wasnt enough of a dialogue he said voters never reached the 
point of getting a clear view of bush 
that problem should be dissipated when the battle is truly 
joined in the fall when voters get a chance to compare bush and 
dukakis as the men between whom they must choose when they vote for 
president dissipated that is if bush finally escapes reagans 
shadow and is able to convince voters that he is strong enough to 
lead 
as for the bearish attitude of the country analysts in both 
major parties use the same terms 
richard wirthlin reagans pollster has said that his surveys 
show bush is behind at this point and that they also show most 
americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction 
theres a lot of apprehension said hart a common attitude 
he said is todays okay but im worried about tomorrow

in the final push of the primary season its 
california that seems to get all the attention but new jersey is 
also looking for a little respect 
the two states hold primaries on the same day june 7 along 
with montana and new mexico 
california with its prize of 314 delegates and its importance 
in the general election naturally finds its way into the campaign 
spotlight 
democrat jesse jackson for one is throwing nearly all of his 
remaining resources both time and money into his california 
campaign 
vice president george bush the gop nomineetobe is 
campaigning as intensely as if he still had active primary 
opponents and needed californias 175 republican delegates bush is 
clearly looking to the fall campaign in which californias 47 
electoral votes could be pivotal 
but new jersey wants a share of the limelight too 
though offering only about a third of the delegates at stake in 
calfornia new jersey is still the nations eighthlargest primary 
with 109 democratic delegates and 64 republican delegates at stake 
the candidates cant really afford to turn their their backs on 
those kind of numbers despite the headaches of simultaneously 
running campaigns on both sides of the country 
even if jet lag is the price to be paid theyre taking the new 
jersey primary seriously 
both jackson and democratic frontrunner michael dukakis were in 
new jersey on sunday and jackson will be back next week 
dukakis was scheduled to campaign in new jersey on wednesday and 
thursday before heading to los angeles 
newark mayor sharpe james chairman of the jackson campaign in 
new jersey says even if the candidate cant be in two places at 
once hell make his presence felt in new jersey 
hes everywhere you have to go to get votes said james 
observers are already predicting jackson will do well in new 
jerseys cities and among minority voters but dukakis seen as 
likely to win the state by a sizable margin 
rep james florio of new jersey a dukakis backer says even 
though the massachusetts governor is favored in the state he 
doesnt intend to get complacent and slight new jersey 
the combination of new jersey and california are very 
important florio said aides to dukakis are hoping the 
combination of contests on june 7 will give their candidate the 
number of delegates he needs to clinch the democratic nomination 
in past elections new jersey has demonstrated some clout 
in 1984 walter mondale racked up a comfortable win over gary 
hart and jackson in new jersey a victory that did much to nail 
down the nomination the same day hart scored a 21 triumph over 
mondale in california but it was too little too late 
still some new jersey politicians long for a place in the sun 
without having to compete with california 
new jersey gov thomas kean a republican has attempted 
unsucessfully to have the date of the states primary moved up 
i worry that new jersey is getting lost in the presidential 
primary shuffle kean said in a speech to the state legislature 
a bipartisan commission suggested holding the primary a week 
earlier this year but the proposal was not acted upon 
they were only attempting to get it out from the shadow of 
california said kean spokesman carl golden

michael dukakis who added oregon to his growing 
list of primary wins is talking more and more like a man who fully 
expects to win the democratic presidential nomination 
dukakis has been at pains in recent weeks to avoid sounding 
overconfident but in his victory statement tuesday night he was 
looking ahead to a fall faceoff with republican nomineetobe 
george bush following the final round of primaries 
we will campaign hard for victories in california new jersey 
montana and new mexico on june 7 and for the white house next 
fall he said 
the people of oregon he said voted for a candiate who can 
win the presidency 
a day earlier at the statehouse dukakis made some lighthearted 
remarks that also reflected confidence 
this state will be blessed with a great new governor dukaks 
said tuesday night at a birthday party for massachusetts lt gov 
evelyn murphy she would succeed dukakis if he assumes the 
presidency in january 
dukakis drew laughs from the friendly crowd by delivering a 
standard joke that if he moves to the white house he will have 
an opportunity to live in public housing for the first time in my 
life 
dukakis was tending to state business today before leaving 
tonight for campaign appearances in new york and in new jersey 
which holds its primary june 7 dukakis won the new york primary 
last month but with an eye on the fall already has returned there 
several times for fundraisers and other events 
his loss to jesse jackson in the district of columbia primary 
was the only dukakis defeat in the last 10 primaries 
the governor was to spend thursday morning in new jersey before 
heading to california for a weekend of campaigning in advance of 
that delegaterich states primary also june 7 the final day of 
the primary season 
before heading to murphys birthday party dukakis met at the 
statehouse for 90 minutes with rep mel levine of california a 
member of the house foreign affairs committee and an expert on 
usisraeli relations 
dukakis has been holding a series of meetings with congressional 
leaders aimed at bolstering his standing in foreign policy matters 
it was a very productive meeting levine said as he left the 
governors office i found the governors questions to be to the 
point reflecting a substantive background in the area a great 
deal of sympathy for our concerns and a real inquisitive mind and 
interest in finding solutions to very difficult problems in the 
middle east 
levine also said dukakis is in terrific shape to win the 
california primary 
dukakis aides say they expect the contests in california and new 
jersey to push the governor over the 2081delegate mark needed to 
secure the nomination

police strictly enforced a 55 mph limit us 59 is a major divided 
highway a few miles east of interstate 45 the main route between

the european space agency has 
scored its 18th success in 22 launches of the ariane rocket 
sending an intelsat v telecommunications satellite into orbit in a 
nearflawless operation 
the only incident was a 15minute halt in the countdown caused 
by a storm cloud passing by six minutes before scheduled liftoff 
the launch took place at 858 pm tuesday 758 pm edt 
sixteen minutes and 40 seconds later the 4374pound satellite 
separated perfectly officials at the european space center in 
kourou on the north coast of south america called the flight a 
complete success 
it was the second successful operation this year six more 
launches are planned in 1988 and nine each in 1989 and 1990 
three of arianes four launch failures were caused by problems 
with the rockets third stage the last failure in 1986 halted 
the program for nearly a year 
the 22nd ariane shot is a new success for the european 
launcher said president francois mitterrand of france in a 
message to frederic allest president of arianespace the 
commercial arm of the space agency 
it is particularly important for the renown of the french and 
european space industries at a moment when they are engaged in a 
very tight world competition 
the intelsat vf13 satellite which was put into a fixed orbit 
22500 miles above earth is part of a series of 15 satellites 
built by an international consortium led by ford aerospace it 
contains 15000 telephone circuits and two television channels 
the four ariane shots after an interruption in launches of 
nearly a year proves the viability of the launcher and puts europe 
in a very good world position because arianespace holds 56 percent 
of the world orders for satellites said premier michel rocard of 
france 
the europeans now have 44 launches on their order books 
representing 26 billion ariane launches cost between 53 million 
and 105 million depending on the version 
the next launch scheduled for june 8 will be the first of the 
new ariane 4 series a much larger vehicle capable of carrying 42 
tons into orbit nearly double the capacity of tuesdays ariane 2 
ariane 4 with greater fuel capacity and more powerful motors 
is scheduled to be the commercial workhorse of the european space 
effort for the next decade 
the international telecommunications organization plans to send 
up one more intelsat v satellite then it too will move into bigger 
equipment the intelsat vi satellites will contain 40000 telephone 
circuits 
commercial satellite launching is also offered by the united 
states the soviet union and china 
the us program still is struggling to get back into 
competition however because of the major setback suffered when 
the space shuttle challenger blew up on jan 28 1986 and other 
failures seven astronauts died in the disaster

gov michael s dukakis is under sharp attack from 
critics at home who say he ignored warnings of a state budget 
crisis because they came just before key presidential contests 
dukakis the democratic frontrunner has made a string of 
balanced state budgets a big selling point in his presidential 
campaign this week though he announced that state revenues were 
more than 240 million below projections included in the budget 
were all aboard the government titanic and instead of women 
and children first its the captain and the crew first house 
taxation committee chairman john flood said tuesday 
they will be rolling on across the potomac river while the 
ship of massachusetts goes down with the rest of us on it said 
flood one of the few democrats in the legislature who criticizes 
dukakis publicly 
dukakis top budget aide dismissed the criticism saying the 
governor told lawmakers a year ago the budget was based on revenue 
projections that might turn out to be overly optimistic 
the critics acknowledged getting that warning when dukakis used 
his veto power to slice 88 million from the budget but they say 
the governor should have curbed spending beginning in january when 
the administration conceded revenues for the first half of the 
fiscal year were lagging by 200 million 
but the dukakis administration said it expected revenues to 
improve and meet targets that soothing forecast came days before 
the iowa caucuses the first big test of the campaign year 
if anybody tells you any of this stuff is not related to 
presidential politics either they are naive or they think everyone 
else is said flood 
republicans among the dukakis critics vowed to continue their 
attacks and predicted vice president george bush would pick up 
their themes during his expected fall campaign against dukakis 
they had to see the problem but they chose to ignore it and 
delay acting because it was not favorable to the governors 
campaign said house minority leader steven pierce as he 
campaigned across the country it was his massachusetts miracle 
but now its our deficit 
they have known that the budget situation was worsening 
daily said republican rep john c bradford he accused dukakis 
of sidestepping his gubernatorial duties while fantasizing about 
moving to that white building halfway down the atlantic coast 
the figures released monday showed the state was 243 million 
short for the fiscal year that ends june 30 forcing dukakis to tap 
reserve and other funds to balance the budget 
that figure is 166 million more than the shortfall projected by 
the governors revenue advisory board on april 12 
by the campaign calendar thats a week before the big new york 
primary and two weeks before the pennsylvania primary dukakis won 
them both tightening his grip on the nomination with followup 
victories in indiana and ohio 
the 243 million shortfall is in addition to 233 million for 
planned budget expenditures that have been canceled because of the 
fiscal crunch 
add that up and this state is 470 million out of balance 
flood said they had to know it but they just ignored it for 
political reasons 
secretary of administration and finance frank keefe scoffed at 
the criticism pointing to the vetoes last year and the 
legislatures rejection of a 255 million dukakisfiled tax 
enforcement and fee package 
im a little bit amused by folks who want to rewrite 
history keefe said tuesday it was the legislature that fully 
believed the future was going to be just like the immediate past 
which was a period of enormous good fortune 
keefe said dukakis had instructed him as far back as september 
1987 to put together contingency plans to cut 185 million in 
spending and at several intervals since has told keefe to look for 
further cuts 
the administration considered the revenue advisory boards april 
projected shortfall of 77 million conservative but did not say so 
publicly because that might have hurt the states credit rating 
keefe said 
we werent about to say absolutely that things were horrible 
when we had no concrete evidence that was the case said keefe

as george bush said it hasnt been a good 
day 
the republican nomineetobe did win another uncontested primary 
victory tuesday in oregon but he also had to face polls suggesting 
his standing is slipping in a hypothetical fall matchup with 
democratic frontrunner michael dukakis 
a los angeles times poll out today indicated bush trails dukakis 
in california a key battleground in november 
the vice president concedes that his problem might stem in part 
from troubles that have dogged the reagan administration 
controversies about attorney general edwin meese panamanian 
military leader manuel noriega and the irancontra affair 
it could an accumulation of current events but i dont worry 
about it ive learned not to live on these polls bush said 
talking to police officers battling gangs in los angeles on tuesday 
stopping drug traffic is bushs topic today as he visits a 
house where crack was sold and visits a school fighting its own 
drug problem 
but bushs woes all but drowned out his talk of agriculture and 
drugs on tuesday 
its hasnt been too good a day he said in los angeles 
but it will turn around it will turn around 
part of the problem is the combination of the democratic and 
republican nomination fights at this point bush aides said 
dukakis is in a very enviable position he is scoring a knock 
every tuesday while we have no opponents and we have suffered 
in the polls said spokesman pete teeley 
teeley admitted the administrations problems are bushs 
whatever happens to the administration rubs off on the vice 
president 
bush has refused to talk about meeses problems but he stepped 
a slight distance away from the reagan administration on the furor 
over a proposed deal with noriega admitting a deal is unpopular 
asked about a senate resolution condemning any deal he said 
i think it expresses a lot of the strong feeling out there across 
the country on that matter very strong 
but despite repeated questions bush refused to give his opinion 
on whether noriega should be allowed to escape drugrunning charges 
in exchange for stepping down 
bush took the offensive on the irancontra affair accusing 
democrats of leaking scurrilous allegations against him that 
arent true 
youve had endless investigations each one with a lot of 
democrats slavering trying to find something wrong and they 
havent bush told reporters in fresno the american people are 
fair they know when someone is telling the truth 
the vice president professed not to be concerned about a cbs 
newsnew york times poll putting him 10 points behind dukakis the 
poll put bush at 39 percent and dukakis at 49 percent in a fall 
matchup 
in another poll limited to california dukakis lead was even 
wider a los angeles times survey suggested dukakis had a 17point 
lead over bush in the state 53 percent to 36 percent with 11 
percent undecided the times poll questioned 2202 californians by 
telephone in six days ending monday night the margin of error was 
3 percentage points 
bush acknowledged those kind of numbers were not good news 
no they werent he said but he quickly pointed to polls 
indicating he trailed in new hampshire a primary he went on to win 
bush argued that the fall campaign has not really begun so 
hypothetical matchups at this point dont prove much 
the thing hasnt really started in terms of democrats versus 
republicans and we havent gotten any of that in focus and it wont 
be until after the convention bush said adding he will not 
try to join every issue with the democrats or start jumping all 
over them right now 
bushs negative ratings were high in the cbstimes poll 
thirtythree percent said they had a favorable view of bush but 
even more 35 percent said they had an unfavorable view while

three men who smuggled a bomb from canada 
into vermont belong to a syrian terrorist group that assassinated 
lebanese presidentelect bashir gemayel officials said in asking 
for maximum sentences 
us attorney george terwilliger iii said tuesday he was aware 
of the association within 48 hours of the oct 23 1987 arrests 
we deliberately kept the association out of our case because 
it was not relevant to any of the charges terwilliger said we 
came away from the trial without any possible taint to our case 
that premature disclosure of this association might have caused 
us district judge albert coffrin has not set a sentencing date 
for the three lebaneseborn canadians 
acts of terrorism such as suicide bombings kidnappings and 
murder have become all too commonplace as instrumentalities of 
political operations in some parts of the world terwilliger said 
what this case is about is an attempt to import those 
techniques into the territory of the united states 
that charge drew an immedate rebuke from a lawyer for one of the 
men who said the fbi had failed to produce any proof that three 
are members of the syrian social national party 
theyre going to have to prove it said mark keller a 
lawyer for defendant walid kabbani we can say no hes not a 
member of the party is that enough 
floyd clarke head of the fbis criminal investigation division 
said sources and channels of information on which the allegation 
was based are confidential 
the three were arrested oct 23 1987 in richford after the 
town police chief spotted them behaving suspiciously near the 
international border a search of their van turned up explosives 
authorities said 
it is believed to be the first time middle eastern terrorists 
have been arrested in the united states carrying explosives said 
justice department spokesman john russell 
based on the information known by the fbi it is our judgment 
that the crimes committed by the defendants in vermont were 
undertaken in furtherance of the defendants ssnp activities 
clarke said in an affidavit 
clarkes affidavit said the fbi does not have enough information 
to state conclusively the intended bomb target 
the affidavit was submitted with a sentencing memo and filed by 
terwilliger in us district court in burlington 
walid mourad pleaded guilty jan 26 to conspiring to transport 
explosives and an immigration violation and faces up to 10 years 
in prison 
george younan and kabbani were found guilty by a jury of several 
explosives violations and an immigration violation younan faces up 
to 35 years in prison and kabbani up to 30 years and six months 
all three are in custody awaiting sentencing 
the ssnp is responsible for car bombings in lebanon in 1985 and 
1986 that killed 105 people and injured 378 as well as the 1982 
assassination of gemayel clarkes affidavit said 
the group began in the 1930s as a fascist paramilitary 
organization opposing the french mandate regime in lebanon and 
espousing greater syria which envisioned syrian control of 
lebanon and what was then palestine the affidavit said

highlevel chilean officials are foiling attempts 
to learn the fate of nearly 700 prisoners who vanished in the four 
years after gen augusto pinochet seized power in 1973 amnesty 
international charged today 
in an 18page report the londonbased organization said many 
aspects of secret police and military operations have come to light 
in the past decade and provide overwhelming evidence that the 
disappeared were victims of the military governments program to 
eliminate suspected opponents 
amnesty appealed to chilean authorities to account for the 
prisoners 
the report said the prisoners plight had been sufficiently 
documented by nongovernmental investigations to be presented to 
chilean courts but that in virtually all cases the investigations 
have been blocked by higher courts or obstructed by the security 
forces 
in some cases the courts have determined the fate of prisoners 
and found that military and police personnel were involved in the 
detention torture and murder of the victims it said 
but the report said chilean authorities often have issued false 
or misleading reports on the missing persons suggesting that the 
names were assumed or invented 
amnesty international said its report compiles for the first 
time a summary of the evidence on the arrests and the secret 
detention centers where prisoners were held by what it called 
chiles secret military and police apparatus 
the evidence has been gathered by relatives human rights groups 
and members of the judiciary the report said and includes the 
testimony of hundreds of former prisoners who saw the missing men 
and women in detention centers and have identified those who 
operated the centers 
other evidence came from confessions by former security force 
officers describing how the disappearances took place 
the disappearances of chilean citizens dropped sharply in 1977 
but have not stopped completely the report said adding that five 
opposition activists disappeared as recently as september 
some court cases involving evidence of serious crimes including 
those relating to disappearances have been closed under a 1978 
amnesty law preventing prosecution for certain crimes committed in 
the five years after pinochet came to power in a military coup the 
report said 
in june 1987 the appeals court in santiago upheld a lower court 
decision that the amnesty law applied to the case of 10 members of 
the outlawed communist party whose 1976 disappearance was being 
investigated by judge carlos cerda 
cerda caused a sensation in 1986 by charging 38 members of the 
military including highranking officers in active service in the 
illegal arrest of two political prisoners who subsequently 
disappeared 
amnesty international has said the ruling could effectively 
block future judicial investigations into missing prisoners

several radio stations broadcast 
reports critical of sandinista policies in defiance of the leftist 
government which threatened to impose sanctions unless the stations 
tone down their criticism 
one of the stations radio corporacion on tuesday quoted the 
head of the nongovernmental human rights commission lino 
hernandez as saying the communications law which the government 
had threatened to apply is absolutely a violation of human 
rights 
interior ministry officials summoned directors of eight private 
radio news programs to a meeting on saturday and told them to be 
careful about reporting on military recruitment the economy and 
government 
on tuesday radio noticias reported the black market rate for 
dollars was rising criticized several government measures for 
causing unemployment and called the staterun oil company an 
organism without authority 
the roman catholic church station radio catolica condemned the 
media restrictions which critics called a backward step in the 
process of democratic reform 
radio mundial said in an editorial the liberals having 
suspended the state of emergency substituted it with another 
system based on the application of the law of security and 
maintenance of public order 
the vaguely worded communications law which the sandinistas had 
been applying since they seize power in 1979 provides for 
sanctions that include closing the stations 
under another law which the sandinistas enacted in 1982 and 
rescinded in january censorship of newspapers and radio was 
allowed 
the sandinista government began to loosen press restrictions in 
the fall as part of its compliance with a central american peace 
plan signed aug 7 by the presidents of nicaragua el salvador 
costa rica guatemala and honduras 
the opposition newspaper la prensa which had been closed for 15 
months and permitted to reopen in october criticized the 
government threat in an editorial on monday the sandinista 
regime it said imposes censorship restrictions on the 
broadcasters because it doesnt want freedom of expression the 
editorials headline was the muzzle law returns 
la prensa said some of its reporters have been harassed by the 
sandinistas but that the government has not interfered with its 
editorial policy

support is growing among scientists for a 
controversial theory that all the earths water including oceans 
lakes and icecaps originated from blackened snowball comets that 
even now are falling from space by the millions 
papers presented tuesday at the american geophysical union 
meeting here along with studies reported from europe and canada 
are slowly adding scientific weight to a concept that once 
threatened to undermine the career of university of iowa physicist 
louis a frank 
the findings frank said tuesday are beginning to ease the 
professional pain he first endured after publishing the theory two 
years ago 
no one has yet found data to show the comets dont exist he 
said the support helps but frank admitted my life would 
certainly have been easier if his snowballsfromspace theory had 
never been published 
the iowa scientist based his theory on data gathered from 1981 
to 1986 by the dynamics explorer i satellite in pictures taken to 
study air glow around the earth frank found unexplained holes that 
appeared to have been punched through the upper atmosphere 
he puzzled over the problem for months and discarded dozens of 
possible answers before concluding that the only thing that could 
make the holes were 100ton comets made of ice and covered with a 
black hydrocarbon and he calculated they were falling to earth at 
the rate of 10 million a year 
the comets which are actually ice balls would come apart as 
they neared the earth and would then flash to vapor in the 
atmosphere frank said eventually the vapor fell as rain and 
joined the earths water cycle 
he calculated that the snowballs measuring about 30 feet across 
each contributed the equivalent of one inch of water all over the 
earths surface every 10000 years 
that may not sound like much frank said but if this 
started 45 billion years ago when the earth was formed the black 
snowballs would put enough water on the planet to fill the oceans 
and build the polar ice packs 
and if the snowball comets continue for billions of more years 
as frank believes it could make major changes to the earths 
climate 
initially many scientists met the idea with ridicule and frank 
said he feared for his career but some took it seriously enough to 
test the concept with experiments 
clayne yeates a physicist at the jet propulsion laboratory in 
california said tuesday he at first was very skeptical 
but yeates said he used a powerful space search telescope at the 
kitt peak observatory in arizona to scan the heavens for the 
snowballs and did in fact capture photo views of the speeding 
comets approaching earth 
it was remarkable the results agreed exactly with the 
predictions said yeates 
thomas donahue a space physicist at the university of michigan 
thought franks theory could be disproved by measuring the level of 
hydrogen atoms which would be released by the water vapor in the 
space about the earth 
he studied ultraviolet data collected by the voyager 2 
spacecraft expecting to find that the hydrogen atoms would be at a 
low level instead the data showed the hydrogen was much denser 
than expected enough to support franks theory 
a group of canadian scientists studying data from a camera 
carried aboard a spacecraft called viking pronounced vicking 
discovered that it too detected the atmospheric holes that 
frank found in the explorer satellite data 
other studies also are lending support to the theory these 
include 
a penn state university study has used microwave detectors to 
confirm the presence of water volumes at high altitudes similar 
data were reported by west german scientists using rockets to study 
the atmosphere 60 to 80 miles above the earth 
a study of one of historys most famous space snowball 
halleys comet has shown that the deuteriumtohydrogen ratio in 
the comet is the same as in the oceans of earth indicating that 
comets could have contributed this ratio to the planet

the wife of disabled white house press 
secretary james brady is pressuring a key house opponent of 
deadlocked handgun control legislation by making an emotional 
appeal to his campaign contributors 
sarah brady said in a telephone interview tuesday that her 
efforts on behalf of the bill include a pitch to campaign 
contributors of rep clay shaw rfla 
we are trying everything everything reasonable we can think 
of to get the measure approved by the house judiciary crime 
subcommittee said sarah brady whose husband was shot by john 
hinckley in the 1981 attempt on president reagans life 
the bill would establish a national sevenday waiting period to 
permit local law enforcement officials to conduct background checks 
on handgun buyers if they thought them necessary 
rep william hughes dnj the subcommittees chairman and a 
supporter of the bill said the measures prospects werent good 
this year 
ive been working the last month and a half trying to get 
votes and there is no bipartisan consensus hughes said 
clay needs to hear from people back home that a vote for the 
brady bill is the right thing to do said a letter from mrs 
brady to one of shaws contributors in jacksonville 
the gun lobby is spending millions of dollars to defeat the 
measure and shaw was under intense pressure to oppose it she 
wrote 
shaw said in an interview that he never had been lobbied that 
way before i thought that was kind of clever he said 
hughes said the bill has the support of five democrats on the 
panel but is opposed by the four republicans and rep harley 
staggers dwva 
national rifle association lobbyist dave conover said the nra 
opposes the bill in part because most states have considered the 
waiting period question on their own and many have rejected it 
however about onethird of the states have adopted their own 
waiting periods 
mrs brady said that if a sevenday waiting period had existed 
in 1981 hinckley would have been unable to buy the handgun used in 
the assassination attempt from a dallas pawn shop because it would 
have been discovered that he lied about his address 
but shaw said he believed a study was needed to see whether 
the waiting period is really going to achieve its purpose of 
keeping guns out of the hands of felons among the questions he 
said are whether information and recordkeeping systems are 
sufficient to meet the demands of the bill 
james brady officially has retained the title of reagans press 
secretary despite his injury his wife has also lobbied for a 
houseapproved bill that would ban plastic guns and any other 
firearms that cannot be detected by metal detectors and xray 
machines

employees at a new japaneseamerican 
steel plant in this ohio river town are diligent and hard workers 
says the mills top executive but they have one flaw 
there is a very bad habit spitting takamasa yamamura 
chairman and chief executive officer of wheelingnisshin inc said 
at dedication ceremonies tuesday i asked the employees please 
stop the spitting this is my house 
spitting is ubiquitous in west virginia as is chewing tobacco 
but its not welcome in the spotless stateoftheart 
steelcoating plant 
company officials and politicians hope the plant will ignite an 
economic recovery in the upper ohio river valley where idle steel 
mills sit rusting 
this project is very important because it is coming at a very 
difficult time in the american steel industry said yuzuru abe 
chairman and chief executive officer of japans nisshin steel co 
ltd nisshin coowns the plant in a joint venture with 
wheelingpittsburgh steel corp which operated a steel plant at 
the site before it closed 
politicians workers and townspeople joined company officials in 
dedicating the 65 million computercontroled mill even the 
refreshments reflected the crosscultural marriage sushi and 
chicken were served while a high school band played standards of 
the 1940s 
this has to be the happiest day of my life believe me said 
mayor adam dalessio in a short time we have come from what was 
a very gray future to one bright with opportunities 
as proof of the towns rebound the mayor who worked at the 
former wheelingpitt plant for more than 40 years cited the 
opening of a new fastfood restaurant and a bank a new supermarket 
and drug store are scheduled to open within a month in the town of 
3900 people 
wheelingpitt provided the land along the ohio river where the 
3blocklong plant sits the plant was built with the help of 55 
million in loans from sanwa bank of japan and an 875 million 
federal urban development grant 
follansbee was selected over towns in pennsylvania and ohio that 
sought the mill which employs about 90 and will grow to 100 
workers when it enters full production in july 
the aluminized and galvanized steel the plant produces resists 
rust and is used in construction automobiles and appliances 
coated flatrolled steel is considered one of the most profitable 
sectors in the highly competitive steel industry 
wheelingpitt which supplies about 80 percent of the steel used 
by the plant will receive a third of the profits generated at 
follansbee nisshin steel japans sixthlargest steelmaker will 
get the rest 
among the difficulties faced by the american plant employees 
who will work alongside a few japanese workers was adapting to the 
japanese style of management everyone at the plant including 
company executives wears a powderblue shirt and dark blue 
trousers while on the job and employees will have a say in company 
operations 
wheelingnisshin spent 3 million training the workers 
including sending many to japan 
id like to say thanks for our training said plant employee 
john thompson not only has it been invaluable nothing like it 
has ever happened to me in my lifetime

an fbi report says soviet intelligence agents 
are among the most enthusiastic users of us libraries where they 
rush to read sensitive technological information before it is 
classified 
the report released tuesday said the soviets are looking for 
scientific and technical documents on a variety of topics and 
the most recent developments in americas military programs 
but a representative of the 50000member american library 
association says fbi countermeasures have gone too far with a 
more generalized effort to solicit librarians to do surveillance 
work 
patrice mcdermott assistant director of the associationss 
office for intellectual freedom said enlisting the support of 
librarians in identifying suspicious individuals violates 
professional ethics 
soviet agents try to identify the nations emerging technology 
before its components become classified or restricted the fbi 
said 
libraries also are places where soviets try to recruit those 
with technological expertise especially americans who might have 
access to classified information according to the report 
americans who provide only public information initially may be 
asked for classified material if the relationship with a soviet 
agent evolves the report said 
the kgb and the library target 1962present was made public 
as fbi director william sessions testified before senators on the 
bureaus library awareness program a counterespionage operation 
against the 26yearold soviet collection effort 
the library association disputed sessions testimony to the 
senate judiciary committee in which he insisted the fbi program is 
confined to 21 scientific and technical libraries in the new york 
city area 
sessions said the fbi contacted librarians elsewhere but only 
when agents were tracking down specific leads 
ms mcdermott said her group has received information that the 
fbi asked for the generalized information outside of new york 
ms mcdermott added we know that the fbi is applying the name 
library awareness program only to what is going on in new york 
however they have sent agents into libraries in other parts of the 
country asking generalized information 
she said librarians have been asked to inform on people who 
look suspicious or might be hostile to the united states its 
been very vague its part of a more generalized effort to solicit 
librarians to do surveillance work 
the report said the soviets have targeted the library of 
congress along with scientific and technical sections of public 
libraries specialized departments of university libraries and 
large information clearinghouses 
the report said the soviets also are trying to identify selected 
librarians to work wittingly or unwittingly on behalf of the 
soviet intelligence services other targets are college students 
and professors scientists engineers and corporations who work in 
areas of advanced technology 
the utilization of the libraries is a fertile area for the 
training and developing of newly recruited agents the report 
said 
while the information is unclassified the soviets use unlawful 
methods to obtain it including removal of thousands of documents 
from specialized scientific and technical libraries by trained 
soviet agents 
the soviets also use their exchange students in the united 
states to identify useful libraries to subscribe to literature and 
reports and to obtain material available to them as students 
sessions called the library program an important 
counterintelligence program and commented i think we have a 
responsibility to do it any librarian can say to an fbi agent i 
do not choose to give that information 
people dont come to a technical library to read goldilocks 
and the three bears he added

led by captain hook a hardened 
veteran of the high seas 1100 endangered sea turtles raised in 
captivity splashed into the gulf of mexico in a populationboosting 
experiment 
the kemps ridley turtles hit the water eight to 15 miles off 
port aransas texas on tuesday and marine biologists hope the 
reptiles will return to multiply on the beaches of texas after 
being decimated by exploitation and pollution earlier this century 
its quite a day raising the little guys from eggs and 
getting to see them shipped off said project spokeswoman donna 
shaver 
first in the water was captain hook a turtle caught by a 
fisherman whose 3inchlong hook and steel cable had been imbedded 
in its throat the cable was later surgically removed 
we try not to get emotionally attached to any of them said 
tim fontaine project manager of the sea turtle head start 
program but we feel really good about him 
a total of 13500 turtles have been freed by the national marine 
fisheries service in galveston in the last 10 years but as far as 
scientists can tell none has yet returned to nest on western gulf 
of mexico beaches the only place in the world where the kemps 
ridleys are known to nest the turtles are expected to return eight 
to 15 years after hatching 
apart from captain hook this latest graduating class of turtles 
spent most of their lives in small circular tubs one turtle to a 
container in climatecontrolled greenhouses in galveston 
some dove gracefully and others bellyflopped but once they 
were released in 40 to 70 feet of water in the gulf they adapted 
well like sea turtles to water 
the kemps ridley turtles considered the worlds most 
endangered sea turtles are know by their species name as 
lepidochelys kempi 
the turtles were hatched from eggs gathered by project workers 
fontaine supervised their growth since they were 3 to 5 days old 
and about the size of silver dollars weighing less than 8 ounces 
today the yearold turtles weigh about 2 pounds each and for 
the first time this year 98 2yearold turtles weighing about 25 
pounds each were released in hopes that more mature animals will 
stand a better chance of surviving 
galvestongrown turtles marked with metal tags or special skin 
grafts or electronic and magnetic devices have been found as far 
away as morocco france and newfoundland the mystery however is 
what triggers the animals nesting and return to the gulf 
the program has received a fiveyear extension and fontaine 
said it probably would end then if no new nests are discovered 
in the late 1940s up to 40000 turtles nested in a single day 
near rancho nuevo mexico about 200 miles south of brownsville 
texas 
today fewer than 600 turtles nest in the entire season from 
april through july or august 
the population decline came as the beaches and turtles and eggs 
were exploited from the 1940s until the 1960s in mexico the 
turtle was believed to be an aphrodisiac 
education programs and guards posted at the nesting beach in 
mexico have resolved those problems 
still the turtles face pollution debris and fishing trawlers 
as enemies 
tony amos an oceanographer at the university of texas said 
autopsies on 50 percent of the dead turtles discovered showed 
plastic in their stomachs

twelve senators have suggested that proposed 
us funding increases for the world bank be used instead to make 
american industries more competitive 
in letter released tuesday to sen john stennis chairman of the 
senate appropriations committee the senators said they are deeply 
concerned about the reagan administrations request to increase 
us funding to the world bank by 701 million annually for the 
next six years 
the world bank continues to subsidize the building of unneeded 
foreign production facilities while us plants close and workers 
lose their jobs the senators said in their letter 
the group cited a recent decision by the world bank to approve a 
400 million loan to mexico to modernize its steel making 
facilities 
until the world bank reverses its policy of funding foreign 
economic development at the expense of the american worker and 
vital us industries we believe that the taxpayers money can be 
better spent on programs to develop efficient technologies which 
make american industries more competitive and put americans back to 
work they said 
the group suggested the additional 701 million proposed for 
fiscal 1989 instead be directed to programs that will assist 
struggling us industries regain their competitive edge in 
international trade

a private study calls for a new federal 
insurance program financed by additional payroll taxes to pay 
nursing home bills and other costs of longterm care for the 
elderly 
the report issued tuesday by the brookings institution also says 
there should be an expansion of private insurance to help cover 
such costs 
alice m rivlin former head of the congressional budget office 
and a lead author of the report stopped short of saying its 
primary recommendation is for a new government program 
she said the main purpose of the 318page report was to compile 
extensive data for congress to debate in shaping a national policy 
however ms rivlin acknowledged the report envisions the 
private insurance as supplementing a government program for 
example the private insurance would cover copayments required of 
beneficiaries under a medicarelike plan or the government role 
would be limited to kicking in only after privately financed 
benefits are exhausted 
longterm care is shaping up as a major issue in 1989 much the 
same way catastrophic coverage for acute illness was an overriding 
medicare issue this year the central question of that 1989 debate 
will be over the extent to which payment of longterm care expenses 
at nursing homes and at home should be a federal responsibility 
no matter what program evolves ms rivlin said provisions would 
have to remain to care for the poor elderly who do not have the 
resources to pay for any of their own care 
the brookings report says the cost of a new social insurance 
program would range between 33 billion and 42 billion compared 
with the 20 billion spent on longterm care under current policies 
that money could be raised it said by a payroll tax of from 
22 percent to 29 percent half on employers and half on 
employees with no cap on the level of wages subject to 
withholding 
medicare currently is financed by a similar tax but with a cap 
on the income subject to taxation 
pending legislation by rep claude pepper dfla would remove 
the cap to provide openended home health care for any disabled 
person young or old 
under questioning ms rivlin said that is a laudable goal 
but its also a very tricky problem 
were concerned that the pepper bill does not have adequate 
safeguards against escalating costs she said

the forms filed with the federal election commission are 
consistent with but more detailed than state financial disclosure 
forms filed by the massachusetts governor last month 
dukakis gained no income in 1987 from the family trust 
established by his late father whose equal beneficiaries are 
dukakis and bates college the elder dukakis alma mater 
the trust drew attention last year when similar forms filed with 
the fec disclosed that until 1986 it included stock in companies 
that do business in south africa 
dukakis has no role in investment decisions of the trust but in 
1986 when questioned about its holdings during a gubernatorial 
reelection campaign told the bank which controls the account to 
divest any stock in companies with south african dealings stock in 
10 such companies was immediately sold 
the trust gained between 15001 and 50000 last year by 
selling stock in unisys corp which maintains operations in south 
africa dukakis campaign spokesman steven akey said the trust had 
owned stock in a company acquired by unisys last year and sold it 
because of unisys ties to south africa 
the trust also reported capital gains of between 5001 and 
15000 from the sale of pepsico inc stock the company maintains 
indirect ties to south africa through its kentucky fried chicken 
subsidiary 
three companies in which the trust has holdings have indirect 
ties to racially segregated south africa largely through 
distribution agreements and spare parts sales contracts according 
to the washingtonbased investor responsibility research center 
they are ibm corp general electric corp and american telephone amp 
telegraph 
akey said the trusts investment policy is to not acquire stock 
in any company on the washington groups list of companies with 
direct dealings in south africa 
dukakis is also a potential cobeneficiary of another 1 million 
trust left by his father but that trust is not considered part of 
his net worth because dukakis 84yearold mother controls it and 
could decide to alter arrangements which currently call for that 
fund to be split by dukakis and bates 
the fec forms which cover the period from jan 1 1987 to 
march 31 1988 show dukakis principal source of income during 
that period was 106310 from his salary as governor the forms 
were filed friday 
he and his wife kitty also earned between 1001 and 2500 in 
interest from a savings account that holds between 15001 and 
50000 between 101 and 1000 in interest from a smaller bank 
account in mrs dukakis name and between 5000 and 15000 in 
interest from the governors holdings in the state retirement plan 
mrs dukakis also earned 20000 last year in salary from a 
harvard university program that cleans up and preserves public 
grounds an investment account in the name of the couples three 
children earned between 2600 and 5100 last year according to 
the fec forms 
the couple also owns a home in suburban brookline that is worth 
more than 100000 
dukakis and his wife who do not use credit cards listed no 
liabilities 
the largest investment in the panos dukakis trust is a 
taxexempt money market fund worth between 100001 and 250000 
five of the trusts investments are worth between 50001 and 
100000 holdings in maine municipal bonds a taxexempt bank 
trust fund general electric atampt and atlantic richfield corp

q if i could clear up that one point though sir havent you 
authorized the dropping of the indictment in return for something 
on mr noriegas part 
a as i have to say when youre negotiating and i did that 
for 25 years as a union officer in labormanagement relations you 
dont go out and talk about what youre negotiating 
q mr president now that the conservatives personified by the 
washington times have jumped ship on attorney general edwin meese 
and the loss of morale in the department the loss of respect for 
the justice department in the country and its integrity are you 
still backing meese and have total confidence in him or are you 
going to ease him out 
a no i have complete confidence in him and i know 
q why 
a because there have been a great many allegations made but 
nothing has been proven and i have seen no evidence of any 
wrongdoing on his part of the kind that it is inferred in the 
allegations that are being kicked around and right now on this 
particular thing i think you would have to talk to him about that 
i think theres more than meets the eye with regard to this 
latest departure 
q what do you mean what are you referring to you mean that 
eastland did something to undermine the attorney general 
a no he made a statement himself that there was no animosity 
in anything that had happened but i think that you should talk to 
the attorney general about that and what happened 
q well is that the role of the press officer to be a defense 
attorney 
a well once again somebody speculated that thats what was 
the reason there and i think that you should talk to the attorney 
general 
q mr president if you cant discuss the negotations with 
noriega i would like to ask you however about your policy goal 
you have said in the past the goal was to see that noriega stepped 
down from power and at various times you have talked about leaving 
the country at various times you havent is your goal not only to 
see that not only noriega leaves power but that none of his 
cronies continue to exercise power in his name

a i said i wouldnt comment but ill make one comment 
what were interested in seeing is a restoration of democracy in 
panama 
it didnt start with this particular name but sometime back 
under another one the commanding officer of the national guard in 
panama suddenly began to take precedence over the president of 
panama and dictate to the government 
we feel that its time that democracy return to panama and this 
is what were negotiating toward 
q well sir if someone controls the government if noriega 
pulls strings behind the scenes is that acceptable to you 
a not if we have reinstituted democracy there in panama but 
again i cant comment further on this 
were in the midst of real negotiations 
q sir the fear is that you are going to agree to a deal which 
has a figleaf of some restoration of democracy but in fact leaves 
noriega in power 
a oh i know ive been reading that the part and hearing 
it in the newscasts and 
q well when you wont comment sir 
a no im not going to back away from what were trying to do 
q mr president there have been charges also that this 
government was aware of drugrunning involved with the contra 
supply possibly illegal contra supply operation can you tell us 
and the congressional committees have been investigating that 
there was no involvement by this government the cia or any other 
agencies of this government in running drugs on the same airplanes 
that were bringing weapons to the contras and are you 
investigating if you didnt know about it to see whether there 
are any is any truth 
a all that i knew about any of this until the indictment came 
down with evidently evidence enough to get to an indictment that 
previously there had been some rumors he was providing information 
on the situation in central america i think to our intelligence 
people and the cia some rumors came up about possible drug but 
no one ever received or could get any evidence to substantiate 
those rumors 
and then this latest thing happened and i dont know whether 
that was whether he just had started or whether there was anything 
really going on 
q but sir there are other charges that there was other 
involvement by this government in drugs on the same airplanes that 
were delivering weapons to the contras beyond noriega did you 
know anything about that is there any 
a no 
q truth to that

a no the only thing i knew is when we operated a sting 
operation and found that the sandinistas were shipping out drugs 
q well 
a and unfortunately the pilot of that plane in that particular 
sting operation was shot down in the streets of an american city 
shortly after he had 
q but are you checking into these latest allegations 
a yes we are 
q mr president how can you given the hard line that you took 
at the very beginning in the situation in panama saying if 
noriega had to leave the country the dominican republic wasnt 
far enough and our recognition of mr delvalle as the president 
how can you do anything in the way of a compromise without 
appearing to back down from your original policy goal 
a again youre asking me that would lead into whats being 
talked about and i can only tell you that were not going to just 
whitewash anyone 
q mr president 
a yeah ive got 
q mr president 
a i suggested two more three and then 
q mr president you have repeatedly denied that astrology 
played any role in the setting of policy but you have ducked the 
question as to whether or not it played a role in the setting of 
schedule a number of aides besides mr regan have indicated that 
astrology did play a role in the setting of schedule including the 
timing of the signing of the inf treaty why did you allow that to 
go on sir 
a it didnt go on 
and this whole thing is built around an incident in which it was 
printed that this had to do with the scheduling of one of my 
operations 
well it didnt happen that way at all

and you know something else 
it didnt have anything to do with me being sworn in as 
governor taking the oath of office at midnight or one minute 
after midnight back when i first became was elected governor 
what i was doing that time was because once i became 
governorelect the incumbent governor whom i had defeated 
started filling up the ranks of appointments and judges to the 
place where i would have had a government all set up before i got 
in 
well i couldnt do much about it 
he was still in office until i was signed in 
i asked the people whod been in charge of my campaign bill 
roberts when was the earliest that i could become governor 
and he said well the minute after midnight the night before 
the inaugural ceremonies 
and i said im going to get sworn in the minute after 
midnight 
and i got sworn in and at least i headed off a half a days 
appointments that he wouldnt have time because the next afternoon 
i was inaugurated 
q were talking about a couple of specific incidents are you 
denying that either you or mrs reagan though used astrology on 
any occasion during your time here at the white house to help to 
set the schedule for trips the signing of the inf treaty i must 
say this goes against what a lot of aides are telling us sir 
a well im only going to tell that one thing 
and that is after i had been shot which was quite a traumatic 
experience for my wife 
q and you 
a and it was not a 
no i was confident i was going to be all right 
other people cant know that 
but a friend remember she was getting a great many friends 
calls from friends 
and a friend called and said that he wished that hed known what 
i was going to do that day and so forth because of he mentioned 
someone that all the signs were bad and everything else 
and nancy was it was a trauma that didnt go away easily 
and when suddenly things of the same kind just for a short 
period there when i was booked for something of the same kind 
where the accident occurred why she would ask what does it look 
like now 
and no changes were ever made on the basis of whether i did or 
did not conduct greater than

q many voices signing of an inf treaty sir 
a no it wasnt 
nothing of that kind was going on 
this was all once again smoke and mirrors 
and we made no decisions on it and were not binding our lives 
to this 
and i dont mean to offend anyone who does believe in it or 
engages in it 
q do you believe in it 
a ive not tied my life by it but i wont answer the question 
the other way because i dont know enough about it to say is there 
something to it or not 
q do you think the attempt on your life could have been 
prevented 
a no this friend thought that had i been told of all that 
that was supposed to be a horrendous time for me that i might have 
done something well we didnt 
q mr president you often spoke of your belief in the 
integrity and honesty of your attorney general id like to ask you 
another question which is dont you think that all of these 
resignations and the difficulty of filling the job and the 
attacks from so many directions are even if he is a man of 
integrity and ability dont you think this is getting in the way 
of the justice department doing its job and isnt that a reason 
for him to step aside on those grounds 
a no because i think that theres been a wave and for quite a 
long time and not just with him but with others in which 
accusation or allegation is taken to mean conviction 
and theres been too much of that 
in this land of ours you are innocent until you are proven 
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt 
and nothing has been proven 
these allegations are continue to be made 
this has been true of others 
this was true of ray donovan and hes his poignant line i 
think fit the situation 
when he was declared totally innocent of any wrongdoing at all 
he said where do i go to get back my reputation 
this also applies to beggs who finally stood up and resigned 
from nasa 
and because of things he was supposed to have done before he 
came into government and was found innocent of every there 
wasnt 
q well are you saying 
a an iota of any kind of support for any of the accusations

government ethics in accordance with law 
in addition to the income from the trust it shows the amount of 
bushs distributive share from hollywood lpg no 2 limited 
partnership or his share in the partnership 
stephen hart the vice presidents press secretary said the 
partnership could not be put into the blind trust with bushs other 
assets because the trust covers only shares or other items listed 
for trading 
other income included a book royalty of 1575 from doubleday 
publisher of the vice presidents recent book of memoirs 
bush had loans of 10000 to 15000 from connecticut general

q are you saying then sir that unless mr meese would be 
indicted that he should remain in office or can there be lesser 
allegations that dont require an indictment that would be grounds 
for him stepping aside 
a i think that for him to step aside would be what he himself 
once said that he would then live for the rest of his life under 
this cloud but with nothing that had ever been proven 
q well what about the mckay report 
q mr president 
a i had recognized the person here to my right so youre the 
last one 
q thank you sir one more about noriega the combination of 
sanctions and the combination of sanctions and negotiations has 
been going on for an awfully long time and it seems as if the 
united states looks progressively weaker arent you a little angry 
that noriega has managed to humiliate and embarrass the united 
states 
a well we had hoped that we could make it possible for the 
people of panama themselves to exert some pressure and do 
something and i guess having run into their own armed troops 
willing to shoot and shooting kind of cooled that down 
so we are continuing to negotiate and our goal remains the same 
q but sir are you not angry about the fact that the united 
states has been looking so weak when its gone up against this man 
a well whether im angry or not doesnt count 
on the situation in panama i will i will not comment on the 
negotiations that are going on in panama and at the appropriate 
time i expect to have a full statement and make it to the american 
people

here is a transcript of president reagans 
questionandanswer session with reporters tuesday 
reagan well i have a statement here a brief statement 
first im pleased that senate majority leader bob byrd and 
republican leader bob dole have agreed to take up consideration of 
the treaty to eliminate an entire class of us and soviet 
intermediaterange nuclear missiles 
this treaty which was signed last december has placed 
ussoviet arms discussions on a path that goes beyond arms 
control and toward real nuclear arms reduction 
im both hopeful and confident that after careful 
consideration the senate will agree that this treaty is a 
diplomatic milestone and will give its consent to united states 
participation 
second the march trade figures were good news the best news on 
this front since march of 1985 
with the trade deficit dropping 41 billion and with exports 
up 54 billion this is clear evidence that the trade balance is 
improving as our economy continues to grow 
now several days ago i received a trade bill from congress 
my message to congress on this matter is currently under review 
and i expect to issue it within a couple of days 
but todays news emphasizes what weve been saying all along 
that this is not the time to be imposing restrictions on trade or 
reducing incentives for free open markets or closing job 
opportunities 
we want more jobs not less 
and we want a job market open to all working men and women in 
this country 
im ready to roll up my sleeves and go to work with the congress 
once again in crafting a trade bill that will continue this trend 
of more job creation and greater economic growth 
q mr president why have you authorized the dropping of the 
drug indictment against general noriega and doesnt that give the 
democrats ammunition for the presidential campaign 
a not if theyll wait until theres something to be announced 
were negotiating right now and therefore i cant comment on 
negotiations that are under way 
itd be foolish to do so 
some things you have to keep to yourself when youre arguing 
with someone else 
but were not i say negotiations are under way 
there has been no decision made on some of the things that are 
being discussed 
and i have to say that i think that much of what many of you 
have been dealing with as a story is based on some kind of leaks or 
misinformation because there are no facts to sustain it

scientists are testing a new way to gauge the 
invisible water vapor in the air a measurement that could clear up 
some of the problems in predicting sudden storms 
their new device measures the weak microwaves given off by water 
vapor allowing them to calculate the amount of water in the air 
above national oceanic and atmospheric administration researchers 
in boulder colo are using a radiometer to measure the radiation 
ed westwater a supervisory physicist at the noaa wave 
propagation laboratory said the readings are particularly helpful 
in detecting sudden changes in moisture such as when a front 
passes through an area 
the radiometer can measure the water vapor every two minutes 
and tests at stapleton airport in denver have found occasions when 
the amount rose or fell as much as four times in a half hour 
westwater said 
knowing about a change like that can help a meteorologist trying 
to predict whether rain or snow will occur and when it could be a 
major factor in issuing a warning of a sudden storm said the 
researcher 
westwater said atmospheric water vapor typically has been 
measured using balloons and satellites 
the balloons give the most detail radioing back the amount of 
water vapor at different levels above the earth but they are only 
launched every 12 hours 
satellites can give continuous readings by measuring the 
infrared radiation given off by water vapor but they cant see 
through clouds so their readings often are unavailable westwater 
said 
while four of the microwave meters are undergoing tests no 
schedule for putting them into active operation has been set money 
is among the problems 
the machines cost nearly 100000 each but companies are 
working on instruments which could sell for as little as 25000 
westwater said

the reagan administration may have sanctioned 
and in some cases recruited convicted drug traffickers in its 
secret effort to aid the nicaraguan contras a house subcommittee 
chairman says 
rep william hughes dnj who chairs the house crime 
subcommittee said tuesday the panel has uncovered a substantial 
amount of evidence suggesting that the administration used known 
drug criminals to secure guns for the rebels 
he said there is no proof so far but that he will air the issue 
at public hearings next month 
president reagan said tuesday he knows nothing about the alleged 
operations no one ever received or could get any evidence to 
substantiate those rumors reagan said 
asked if he planned to check out the reports reagan said 
yes we are 
hughes said his subcommittee has examined a 3year period in 
which administration officials either ignored or encouraged 
criminal activity on behalf of the contra rebels 
there is distinct evidence of a pattern hughes said 
he said the crime panel has uncovered repeated allegations of 
federal agents recruiting or coercing criminals to work on behalf 
of the contras who are trying to overthrow nicaraguas leftist 
sandinista government sometimes hughes said the criminals may 
have been recruited as part of a plea bargain 
hughes said the allegations range from poor supervision of 
federal drug cases to the possible use or abuse of the criminal 
justice system in the contras behalf 
hughes said some operatives involved had ties to the medellin 
drug cartel of colombia 
asked if administration officials had direct knowledge of the 
illegal operations hughes replied there would appear to be a 
substantial amount of evidence to suggest that he declined to 
give specifics 
while hughes also declined to name names he said there is 
some evidence that the retired marine lt col oliver l north 
operation had some knowledge north a former reagan national 
security aide has been charged with conspiring to divert iran arms 
sale profits to the contras at a time when congress banned such aid 
hughes also said the role of attorney general edwin meese iii 
remains an open question meese has denied that he usurped 
local jurisdiction in contrarelated investigations 
newsweek magazine on sunday suggested that vice president george 
bushs foreign policy aide donald gregg was the washington 
contact for an arms operation supplying the contras with links to 
drug dealers 
bush lashed out at the report monday as old news not even 
news 
white house and justice department spokesmen have denied 
repeatedly any interference by the administration in local 
investigations 
hughes said congressional investigators have interviewed 
hundreds of witnesses and served 30 or more subpoenas the crime 
panel has coordinated its activities with lawrence e walsh the 
independent council in the irancontra criminal investigation 
hughes said 
among those compelled to testify was jeffery feldman an 
assistant us attorney in miami 
feldman met with subcommittee investigators in closed session in 
july of last year he also was questioned by investigators of the 
congressional irancontra committees 
feldman was the lead prosecutor in a 1985 case involving an 
alleged gun running operation for the contras 
according to crime subcommittee records feldman and his 
superior leon kellner the us attorney in miami may have been 
persuaded to delay the case on instructions from the justice 
department meese has acknowledged discussing the case with 
kellner but denies any attempt to sidetrack the investigation 
there have been numerous allegations that the contras have 
helped support their war effort through drug running and the 
reagan administration also has said the sandinistas have done the 
same 
the crime subcommittee also is investigating possible 
mishandling of the case of barry seal an american who hughes said 
was involved in selling drugs to the nicaraguan government 
reagan in 1986 used a photo taken by seal to show what he 
described as sandinista officials involved in drug dealing the 
photo allegedly showed officials in the capital city of managua 
loading drugs onto an airplane bound for the united states 
hughes said a us drug enforcement administration investigation 
of seal who was later murdered in this country may also have been 
slowed deliberately 
reagan in answering questions tuesday about the overall 
allegations referred to the case 
the only thing i knew is when we operated a sting operation 
and found that the sandinistas were shipping out drugs he said

two rare musk oxen donated to china as 
replacements for a pair that had been presented by richard nixon 
but have since died are ready for a presentation ceremony says the 
woman organized the gift 
the oxen had to stay in quarantine a month before we would 
have the presentation ceremonies helen miller said tuesday as 
she packed for her trip to the dedication at the beijing zoo 
theyve been over there a month and theyve passed their tests 
the ceremony is on the 23rd she added but i dont know 
whether its our 23rd or theirs its a day later going in that 
direction 
mrs miller who planned to depart for china today began a 
campaign to replace the two oxen which were presented to china in 
1972 by thenpresident nixon after she learned in 1980 of their 
deaths 
the oxen milton and matilda were given to china in exchange 
for two pandas lingling and hsinghsing that have become popular 
attractions at the national zoo in washington 
as part of her project the moultrie resident visited the 
university of alaska to view a herd of musk oxen which are found 
only in greenland and arctic regions of north america the oxen 
which have heavy fur coats and horns that curl below their heads 
and then upward were hunted relentlessly for years and are 
considered an endangered species 
mrs miller a retired construction company employee persuaded 
university officials to donate the oxen named koyuk and tanana to 
china under a new uschina bilateral agreement for the exchange 
and preservation of rare and endangered plants and animals 
this is going to be the first gift under this agreement 
said mrs miller ive been working on this project for 7 years 
so this agreement came along at just the perfect time

the battle against infertility is hampered by 
a lack of accurate data about afflicted couples and the 
effectiveness of some treatments a government study says 
the congressional office of technology assessment said tuesday 
that congress could require more data collection and sponsor the 
development of voluntary professional guidelines or extend 
consumer protection laws to selected infertility services 
americans spent 1 billion last year to combat infertility but 
half of them ended up conceiving a child the ota said 
the report said there are 2 million to 3 million infertile 
couples in the united states and it faulted the government for 
failing to keep an accurate count 
the report said couples can spend from a few hundred dollars up 
to 22000 on infertility diagnoses and treatments it said many 
private health insurers do not cover infertility but doctors often 
bill their patients in ways that enable them to qualify for 
insurance payments 
ota said there is no federal regulation of fertility clinics or 
treatments and though there are voluntary professional guidelines 
quality of care varies widely 
nearly half the clinics doing in vitro fertilization have yet to 
achieve a live birth the report said couples seeking ivf 
are often in a quandary over assessing practitioners skills is 
ivf experimental or is it a proven medical therapy in 1988 no 
blanket answer to that question is possible 
it said the government collects little data on factors 
contributing to infertility and does not require reporting of 
chlamydia the most common sexually transmitted disease which can 
damage the female reproductive system

panamanian intelligence officials 
charged that the united states may have been behind a plot to 
encourage antigovernment guerrilla violence aimed at ousting gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
the accusation came during a news conference on tuesday where 
eduardo sanchez one of the alleged conspirators was presented to 
reporters 
sanchez described the plot in a brief statement then was 
removed from the room reporters were not allowed to ask him 
questions 
in another development the pronoriega newspaper la republica 
said on tuesday the treasury ministry has prepared charges against 
panamanian consulate officials in london and four us cities who 
have remained loyal to delvalle 
according to sanchez another coconspirator was eduardo 
herrera a lieutenant colonel in the panamanian defense forces 
herrera was retired in april when he refused orders to return home 
from israel where he had been the panamanian ambassador 
sanchez said he had spoken by telephone with herrera to receive 
instructions on a plan to oust noriega head of the 15000member 
defense forces and panamas de facto leader noriega was indicted 
in florida in february on federal drugtrafficking charges 
lucinio miranda secretary general of the national department of 
investigations told reporters at the news conference that sanchez 
and three others were arrested last week in connection with the 
conspiracy 
miranda said that during the arrests authorities seized a cache 
of weapons including pistols grenades rifles and machine guns 
we dont know what kind of support they had miranda said 
and added they could be backed by washington 
absurd us embassy spokesman terence kneebone told the 
associated press about the alleged conspiracy kneebone said the 
purported plot appeared to have been manufactured out of whole 
cloth 
the reagan administration imposed economic sanctions on panama 
after the noriegadominated national assembly on feb 26 ousted 
president eric arturo delvalle the previous day delvalle had tried 
to fire noriega the united states still recognizes delvalle as 
panamas legitimate president 
la republica said the diplomats that will be charged with 
withholding from the government hundreds of thousands of dollars in 
fees paid to them by people doing business with panama the

most lie detector tests for private employees 
and job applicants would be prohibited under compromise legislation 
approved unanimously by house and senate negotiators 
rep pat williams dmont on tuesday predicted swift 
overwhelming house approval of a measure he said would stop the 
explosion the epidemic of lie detector tests administered 
annually to about 2 million private employees and job applicants 
sen edward m kennedy dmass chairman of the senate labor 
and human resources committee said the bill effectively would 
prohibit as much as 85 percent of private polygraph tests he 
called the tests inaccurate instruments of intimidation 
the bill would not cover federal state or local government 
employees it also would exempt private contractors involved in 
government intelligence or national security work 
williams and other house negotiators accepted without dissent a 
senate amendment sought by business interests and drafted in 
consultation with organized labor that would cover instances of 
economic loss or injury suffered by an employer 
the amendment would allow employers to administer carefully 
controlled lie detector tests as part of a theft investigation 
within the company 
the conditions for such tests are that the employee had access 
to the stolen property that the employer had a reasonable 
suspicion that the worker was involved and that the employer give 
details of the incident and evidence supporting the suspicions in a 
written statement 
senate negotiators accepted a house provision allowing employers 
to give polygraph tests to guards and other security personnel as 
well as employees handling certain controlled drugs as long as 
strict standards are met and the results are not the sole basis for 
adverse action against an employee 
permissible tests would have to be administered under stringent 
guidelines to be developed by the labor department which would 
require that each test take at least 90 minutes and be conducted by 
a licensed examiner 
sen orrin g hatch rutah said business executives 
opposition to the bill was overcome when they realized that these 
quickie polygraph tests are inaccurate unfair and very detrimental 
to their employees 
the house approved the original bill 254158 last nov 4 
williams said the house will act soon on the compromise measure and 
send it to the senate which passed its version on march 3 by a 
6927 vote 
at the time sen thad cochran rmiss said that denying 
employers the chance to screen job applicants will increase 
workplace thefts and consumer costs 
judy goldberg of the american civil liberties union said the 
compromise measure is an important step forward and will have 
its biggest impact in the 28 states that either do not regulate 
polygraph tests or only have licensing laws for examiners

the most severe test firing yet of a 
redesigned space shuttle booster rocket appears to have been a 
success but nasa officials say they wont be certain until the 
booster is disassembled 
everything weve seen in the whole program is looking very 
positive john mccarty head of the marshall space flight 
centers propulsion lab said after tuesdays test it gives us a 
lot of confidence 
the booster was redesigned after the space shuttle challenger 
exploded shortly after liftoff jan 28 1986 when exhaust burned 
through a joint in one of the segmented boosters the test which 
included intentionally flawed booster joints had been postponed 
from last week 
jim thomas technical assistant in the marshall motor project 
office said the absence of bubbles in a bead of grease placed 
outside the redesigned joints indicated they did not leak during 
the test 
the old joint design probably would have failed such a test 
mccarty said 
the test was the fourth of 10 being conducted on the redesigned 
rocket in preparation for augusts shuttle launching it was the 
final test firing of a shortened version of the redesigned booster 
shuttle managers said the firing of the 52footlong booster at 
marshall was the most severe test yet of the redesigned joints 
two joints the casetonozzle joint and the igniter joints 
were intentially flawed through as many as three layers of 
insulation and seals including the last seal intended to keep hot 
exhaust gas from escaping 
it shows the redesigned joints will seal even though we had 
some pretty severe flaws said thomas 
the firing which lasted less than a second generated 960 
pounds of pressure and a temperature of more than 5000 degrees 
fahrenheit inside the case the nozzle end of the stack was plugged 
for two minutes to allow gas to reach the joints 
thomas said the test was unprecedented in the solid rocket 
motor industry but he added the national aeronautics and space 
administration probably wont testfire a fulllength booster the 
same way 
the abbreviated booster tests show the design is tolerant to 
flaws of this type thomas said 
the fifth test of the redesigned booster is planned for the last 
week of july officials said the tests began in november

alexander n pandis lived high plunking down 
32000 for a rolls royce jetting to paris but federal 
prosecutors say he made at least 500000 from such scams as 
selling rare musical instruments he had borrowed 
pandis 25 of chicago pleaded guilty tuesday in us district 
court to mail fraud and creditcard fraud for a series of cons 
including bilking his father out of 53000 that began in 1983 
said assistant us attorney patrick foley 
id describe him as obviously a very bright intelligent 
individual who chose to use his skills for illegal gain foley 
said its actually a very unfortunate commentary on a kid who at 
the age of 20 decided to perpetrate a fraud on various individuals 
and made literally hundreds of thousands of dollars until he was 
caught 
pandis is to be sentenced july 6 and could face up to 15 years 
in prison and 500000 in fines 
the most lucrative of his scams involved borrowing rare antique 
musical instruments such as a 138yearold pierre pacherelle 
violin made in france from one dealer and selling them at bargain 
prices to another foley said 
there is a common practice in the industry to lend rare 
instruments to people so they can try them out in their homes or 
their studios the prosecutor said 
pandis posing as an investment counselor and lawyer told the 
dealers that his clients wanted to buy their rare violins violas 
and violin bows as investments but asked to inspect them first 
he never returned the instruments and made about 250000 by 
selling them to other unsuspecting dealers foley said 
pandis was arrested jan 27 on a federal complaint and indicted 
feb 26 
he used the illict profits for such things as a 32000 rolls 
royce and taking trips to paris london and los angeles foley said 
in december 1985 the indictment said pandis persuaded an 
elderly woman to close her personal money market account and let 
him manage about 100000 of her money foley said 
pandis spent most of the money on himself the indictment 
contends 
he also is accused of stealing more than 40000 from his 
fathers individual retirement account and obtaining 13000 in 
loans using his fathers life insurance policy as collateral 
in another scheme pandis set up his own investment counseling 
firm in 1986 and sold 85000 worth of bogus highinterest bonds 
to 10 investors foley said 
one thing led to another foley said once he ran out of 
juice on one thing he moved on to another the final item was the 
musical instruments which was probably his greatest coup and 
netted him about 250000

the soviets are willing to discuss easing 
jewish emigration restrictions and improving human rights but we 
are awaiting action says one of eight members of congress who 
met with a top soviet embassy official 
weve heard some better talk what we want to see is better 
action said rep charles schumer dny who organized the 
hourlong meeting tuesday with nicolay d smirnov the embassys 
first secretary 
figures from the national conference on soviet jewry based in 
new york show 1086 jews departed from the soviet union in april 
the highest monthly total in nearly seven years the new york times 
reported today 
the last time more than 1000 were allowed to leave in one month 
was in may 1981 when 1141 departed the pace of jewish emigration 
began to rise last year after declining sharply from a peak in 
1979 when the monthly average was more than 4000 the times said 
however schumer detailed new procedural obstacles to 
emigration which he said demonstrate an escalated campaign to deny 
soviet jews the right to leave 
he said the soviet government has reimposed a firstdegree 
relative restriction which mandates that anyone wishing to 
emigrate must produce an invitation from an immediate family member 
living abroad 
thus when strictly enforced the 90 percent of soviet jews 
who have no relatives abroad have no chance to emigrate schumer 
said in a statement 
weve heard talk of loosening things up he said but we 
are awaiting action 
others at the meeting at the soviet embassy were reps louise 
slaughter dny benjamin gilman rny john miller rwash 
barbara boxer dcalif constance morella rmd steny hoyer 
dmd and benjamin cardin dmd 
i think the one positive that i picked up on is they seem a 
lot less defensive than they used to be said boxer they 
admitted that their country isnt perfect they alluded to the fact 
that for the first time theres more criticism in the press about 
the problems that theyre having 
the representatives declined to say much about the content of 
the talks but gilman characterized the meeting as a good open 
and frank discussion of a number of problems

an appeals courts ruling that affirms the 
taxfree export of documentary films is a victory for free speech 
and for makers of movies on controversial topics such as nuclear 
arms and nicaragua filmmakers lawyers say 
the governments attempt to ban the taxfree export of films 
that advocate a cause or seek to influence government policy was 
struck down tuesday by the 9th us circuit court of appeals which 
called the restriction a virtual license to engage in 
censorship 
the court ruled 30 that us information agency regulations 
governing the worldwide distribution of thousands of films each 
year violate the constitutional right of freedom of speech by 
discriminating on the basis of content 
this is a great victory for the first amendment and obviously 
important for filmmakers many of whom have lost significant 
amounts of money because of the export restrictions said david 
lerner spokesman for the center for constitutional rights which 
represented the filmmakers 
the ruling was the second victory in less than a week for 
independent filmmakers who need the agencys approval to qualify 
for an exemption from foreign nations import taxes 
us district judge a wallace tashima of los angeles declared 
last friday that rewritten rules allowing the agency to label some 
exported films propaganda also were unconstitutional tashimas 
1986 ruling invalidating the agencys original labeling regulations 
was upheld by tuesdays ruling 
tashima ordered the usia to draft a third set of rules that do 
not discriminate on the basis of content and to grant approval to 
six films whose producers had filed the suit 
the films include from the ashes a sympathetic portrayal of 
the 1979 nicaraguan revolution in our own backyards on the 
dangers of uranium mining and whatever happened to childhood 
on drug problems among children 
the usia and the justice department declined to comment on both 
rulings 
the usia regulations implement a 1954 treaty signed by about 60 
nations that exempts films from import fees if both the exporting 
and importing nation certify the films educational content 
the usia forces filmmakers to choose between exercising their 
right to free speech and foregoing benefits or curtailing their 
speech and obtaining the benefits said tuesdays opinion by 
judge cecil poole 
noting that the usia has approved a pronuclear power film while 
rejecting the film on the dangers of uranium mining poole said 
both the regulations and the agencys practices seem to 
disapprove materials that criticize and approve those that accept 
the prevailing state of affairs 
he rejected the usias argument that the court should defer to 
the government on decisions that involve the delicate area of 
foreign relations constitutional protections apply equally to 
speech that is directed abroad he said

investigators hope the discovery of a burial 
ground they believe was used by mob hit men will lead to an 
eggsized diamond once owned by the family of sir winston churchill 
and stolen eight years ago a newspaper reported today 
joseph scalise an underworld jackofalltrades imprisoned in 
great britain was convicted of stealing the 960000 marlborough 
diamond a 45carat gem and authorities believe he mailed it from 
london to the united states the chicago tribune reported quoting 
unidentified sources 
his home sits about 50 yards from the site where investigators 
dug up one body monday authorities plan to resume digging today 
the search for the diamond led investigators to the secret 
burial ground in rural du page county west of chicago the 
newspaper said 
forensic experts from the fbi crime lab in washington arrived 
tuesday to help identify the badly decomposed remains unearthed 
from a grave after excavations began monday said fbi spokesman bob 
long 
digging was suspended tuesday until the team and officials from 
the county coroners office finished examining the gravesite for 
evidence and removed the remains 
scalise 48 is serving a 16year sentence for the 1980 london 
jewel store heist in which the marlborough diamond and 26 million 
worth of other jewelry were taken 
fbi agents recently traveled to britain to question scalise and 
another reputed chicago mobster arthur rachel who is imprisoned 
there the tribune reported 
investigators suspect the deserted field near the argonne 
national laboratory was used as a graveyard by mob hit men during 
the citys chopshop wars of the 1970s when the mob seized control 
of the stolen autoparts trade 
several scrap dealers suspected of trying to deal independently 
in stolen auto parts disappeared at the time and investigators 
believe the skeleton found monday may be one of them the tribune 
reported 
unidentified police sources told the newspaper they discovered 
clues pointing to the makeshift graveyards existence during their 
search for the marlborough diamond 
british police learned that on the day of the robbery scalise 
a reputed crimesyndicate enforcer mailed a package from a london 
post office authorities believe it contained the stolen jewelry 
but have never discovered to whom the package was addressed 
when scalise and his accomplice rachel went to prison without 
revealing what they did with the loot authorities interviewed 
their associates including underworld informers the newspaper 
said 
none had much to say about the diamond but several provided 
information about the burial ground the newspaper reported 
on tuesday investigators sifted the soil around the gravesite 
for fragmentary evidence and used metal detectors they also took 
soil samples to determine where else the ground might have been dug 
up 
long said investigators would continue digging through the end 
of the week

professionalism and persistence mitchell quoted cmdr paul x 
rinn the skipper of the uss samuel b roberts as saying their 
sacrifice gave us an example to follow their loss is without a 
doubt the predominant factor responsible for our survival 
one parent at the memorial service rodney erwin recalled 
tearfully how much his son loved boats another karen welch held 
her head up smiled and said proudly my son is still as close to 
me now as he was before he went off to sea 
erwin of troy mich lost his 22yearold son seaman steven t 
erwin in the attack by an iraqi warplane in the persian gulf on

california and added though we struggle against the odds we 
will not surrender

farrakhan jewish groups have also expressed concern over what they 
see as jacksons tilt toward the arabs 
todays session at a hollywood hotel was being attended by about 
40 people organizers said but some jewish leaders boycotted the

voters approved a plan to let denver 
annex land for a new 3 billion airport that would be the first 
major us airport since 1974 and bring relief to one of the 
countrys most congested hubs 
the vote from adams countys 164 precincts in tuesdays special 
election was 34070 or 559 percent for annexation and 26928 or 
441 percent against 
if the vote is certified by the county clerk and the secretary 
of state 45 square miles of unincorporated county land 10 miles 
northeast of stapleton international airport will be annexed by 
denver probably within 10 days officials said 
this is the rocket booster that pushes the airport project 
forward said a jubilant denver mayor federico pena after the 
election 
pena said city officials would direct their energies to 
finishing an environmental impact statement required by the federal 
aviation administration before construction of the airport which 
the faa says could be the nations secondbusiest by the year 2000 
the faa supported the proposed airport because stapleton the 
worlds fifthbusiest airport already is congested and is expected 
to lead the nation in flight delays by 1996 
proponents who devoted more than 1 million to the campaign 
outspending foes by about 10to1 said the airport would boost 
colorados economy and provide jobs they said development would 
mean property tax relief 
opponents argued that closing stapleton would be a waste of 
money they were concerned about increased air pollution jet noise 
over homes and the effects on the 2700acre barr lake state park 
bird refuge near brighton 
the new airport is the first planned in the united states since 
dallasfort worth international airport opened in 1974

cambodias provietnamese government 
has convened an unprecedented national congress to rally local 
leaders in its struggle to keep villages and communes from falling 
into the hands of guerrillas 
the official communist party newspaper pracheachon the people 
said cadres of about 500 model communes across cambodia opened the 
congress in phnom penh monday to discuss how to strengthen local 
defenses 
the paper said the partys ruling politburo considers the 
localities as a matter of life or death to the revolution as 
the core battlefield and the work of building and consolidating 
localities villages communes units and army bases as the key 
task in 1988 
a text of the editorial which was quoted by the official 
domestic radio tuesday was obtained from a western embassy in 
bangkok today 
the paper said the government continues to have problems 
countering the propaganda war the guerrillas mounted after 
vietnamese forces backing phnom penh overran all major guerrilla 
bases along the thai border in 198485 
vietnam invaded the country in late 1978 and is regarded with 
deepseated enmity by many cambodians but people also fear the 
return of the khmer rouge who comprise the largest guerrilla group 
in the cambodian resistance 
the vietnamese ousted the khmer rouge which killed hundreds of 
thousands of people during its threeyear rule 
on may 10 khmer rouge radio claimed guerrillas smashed the 
vietnamese administrative network in more than 4000 villages and 
200 communes during the sevenmonth dry season that ended in april 
claims by the khmer rouge however are widely regarded as 
exaggerated 
pracheachon said the guerrillas were planting secret agents 
and preparing for 1990 when vietnam has said it will withdraw the 
last of its troops from cambodia 
the militia and police forces in a number of localities do not 
act as a real support for the people in attacks against the 
enemy it said 
the peoples living conditions there remain primitive and 
have not improved the party and state policy has not reached 
the people causing a number of them to be misguided by enemy 
propaganda many of them are even helping in enemy maneuvers 
khmer rouge radio has said the guerrillas working in small 
groups use villagers homes as support bases and hiding places 
phnom penh has been trying with its propaganda to lure 
guerrillas and their supporters back into the fold with promises of 
amnesty jobs and rewards

games a record 161 countries including north korean allies china 
and the soviet union have accepted invitations to enter 
the international olympic committee with the souths consent 
offered to let the north stage some events while rejecting the 
cohost demand pyongyang claims that making seoul the exclusive 
host would hinder korean reunification

of northsouth reconciliation to form a unified korean olympic 
team and suggested considering offering the north virtual cohost 
status his aides said

a pastor charged with raping two teenage 
members of his church told female worshipers they could end up in 
hell if they refused his sexual advances and controlled many 
members savings accounts officials say 
law enforcement officials have spent two years investigating the 
tangled finances of the rev thomas streitferdt who lives with his 
wife on a 11 million long island estate that is taxexempt 
because it is used as a parsonage 
streitferdt 59 is free in 25000 bail after he was arraigned 
monday on two counts each of firstdegree rape and firstdegree 
sodomy involving two sisters ages 14 and 16 
the pastor who is white founded his nondenominational true 
church of god in a harlem storefront in 1964 officials said the 
church whose members are mostly black now takes up an entire 
block and features a highly regarded grade school and daycare 
center 
sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said tuesday that 
streitferdt required his 700 members to pay him 10 percent of their 
annual income the practice known as tithing is common among 
fundamentalist sects and is not illegal every third year 
streitferdt demanded 30 percent the sources said 
the sources said streitferdt took complete personal charge of 
the savings accounts of many members of his church and offered them 
other banking services 
the information about streitferdts unusual financial activities 
was provided by records and unhappy church members during a 
twoyear probe the sources said 
streitferdts lawyer benjamin herzweig said his client was not 
a wealthy manipulator he is meticulous he said he crosses 
his ts dots his is and does everything by the book on paper 
hes worth zero 
herzweig said streitferdt and his family were shocked by the 
sexual misconduct allegations 
manhattan criminal court judge charles solomon scheduled a 
hearing for friday when the sources said a grand jury will hear 
rape and sodomy charges against streitferdt 
the judge also ordered streitferdt to surrender his passport 
after assistant district attorney karen silberman said the pastor 
planned to flee 
the prosecutor hinted that new charges could be forthcoming 
against streitferdt because a third woman had alleged he forced her 
to have sex with him during a marriage instruction class a week 
before she was to be married 
ms silberman told solomon that streitferdt had sexual relations 
with numerous adult members of his congregation over a period 
of time she said the pastor told women worshipers they could end 
up in hell if they refused to have sex with him

libyantrained activists were involved in mondays riots in the 
capital of port vila 
police said 30 people were arrested after a march by 2000 
villagers in port vila became a riot with protesters looting shops 
and smashing store windows 
australia also airlifted supplies of riot control gear at the 
request of the vanuatu government headed by prime minister walter 
lini who also is an anglican priest 
lini is the democratically elected head of a government of a 
friendly country and australia cant stand idly by if there are 
attempts to undermine by nondemocratic process that government

administered jointly by britain and france from 1906 until 1980

mexicans continue to head north in search 
of work apparently hoping us employers will ignore a new law 
banning them from hiring illegal aliens authorities say 
i think were going to show them were serious about enforcing 
employer sanctions border patrol agent jerry hicks said tuesday 
after authorities arrested 42 people stowed aboard a freight train 
one of those arrested tomas vega of san luis potosi mexico 
said he got on the northbound railroad grain car without knowing 
what city he would reach 
i came to find work wherever it the train stops the 
21yearold undocumented alien said adding he could not find a job 
in mexico 
vega and about 16 others including a man carrying a crying 
3yearold boy appeared stunned tuesday as they climbed down a 
ladder from the grain car their trip was cut short 30 miles north 
of the rio grande 
the 42 aliens found scattered along the houstonbound train are 
among the thousands of people officials say are continuing to flock 
to this country illegally every week 
employer sanctions under the immigration reform and control act 
of 1986 go into full effect june 1 
hicks the deputy chief patrol agent with the border patrols 
mcallen sector said the numbers have been increasing lately and 
agents who stopped the train tuesday had expected to find even more 
aliens in the trains 113 cars 
immigration officials say lack of employment in mexico is 
prompting the aliens to take their chances on whether employers 
will flout the new law 
a recent fiveday sweep of trains netted more than 100 aliens 
per day officials said including a group suffering from 
dehydration in a sealed boxcar 
the situation in mexico is terrible and people are caught in 
a situation where their country has nothing to offer them said 
telma longoria director of catholic social services for the 
churchs brownsville diocese 
she said the diocese is seeing more central americans than ever 
at its casa oscar romero shelter east of brownsville which 
averages 150200 aliens at any time 
with the weather warming up immigration officials said they are 
checking the trains more often in order to prevent a repeat of the 
tragedy in sierra blanca last summer when 18 aliens suffocated in 
a sealed boxcar in the west texas heat 
on hand to observe tuesday mornings predawn train operation 
were jim olech the border patrol chief in washington and henry 
oncken the us attorney for the southern district of texas 
the border patrols mcallen sector reported 1691 apprehensions 
of undocumented aliens during the first week of may most of whom 
were not on trains last week the sector reported 1080 
apprehensions 204 involving people from countries other than 
mexico said fred rangel a border patrol intelligence agent in 
mcallen 
were still catching 500 or 600 a day said doug mosier 
with the border patrols el paso sector that stretches to the new 
mexicoarizona line 
he said apprehensions in the sector are about 30 percent below 
the rate of 1986 when agents made 312000 alien arrests some of 
which were multiple apprehensions of the same people 
the new laws had its impact but still people are willing to 
take a chance said michael obarr border patrol agent in the 
laredo sector unfortunately we have those employers who are 
willing to hire them

israeli foreign minister shimon peres said 
today he believes there is a fair chance the soviet union will 
move towards taking a role within the us framework for peace in 
the middle east 
peres a strong backer of the american peace plan made his 
comments after meeting in washington tuesday with the soviet 
ambassador to the united states 
i think that there is a fair chance that the russians will 
make some moves in the direction of the united states proposal 
said peres interviewed from toronto on nbctvs today program 
im not sure they will be able to reach a conclusion but even 
if they will reach some progress it will be of importance and great 
meaning he said 
soviet ambassador yuri dubinin expressed significant 
differences in the soviet position at the meeting saying the 
kremlin no longer insists on a dominant role for an international 
conference in arabisraeli peace talks according to an israel 
source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
peres said today he welcomed the participation of kremlin leader 
mikhail s gorbachev but insisted the soviets would have to work 
within the american blueprint 
the problem is not his participation but the nature of his 
participation peres said it depends very much on the the 
russian policy if there will be the slightest attempt to try 
to teach us a lesson or to impose a solution i think all parties 
will refuse 
until now the united states and israel rejected soviet demands 
that the superpowers be given an active role in arabisraeli talks 
the us peace plan envisions the superpowers only as overseers 
devoid of any power to impose 
earlier assistant secretary of state rozanne ridgway told 
reporters the soviets remain ambiguous about their position on the 
peace plan the soviets have made some hints we will keep 
plugging away at them and the whole notion of the peace process 
will be on the summit agenda she said 
the meeting with dubinin follows contacts peres held last week 
with soviet officials in europe based on those contacts peres 
said he expects the soviet union will tell president reagan at the 
superpower summit in moscow later this month that they are backing 
a ussponsored mideast peace plan 
i think the occasion will really be in the summit meeting to 
have the russians adopt the needs of the middle east and not the 
middle east submitting to ideas that were born in moscow peres 
told reporters following a 30minute meeting with reagan 
peres and secretary of state george p shultz both hope soviet 
backing will draw jordan and the palestinians into the stalled 
peace process thereby forcing israeli prime minister yitzhak 
shamir to join too shamir has rejected the international auspices 
the plan envisions for arabisraeli talks 
in a clear reference to shamir the white house said 
those leaders who are negative consistently reject new ideas 
and fail to exploit realistic opportunities to bring about 
negotiations make progress impossible in the end they will have 
to answer to their own people for the suffering that will 
inevitably result 
the statement praised peres saying he is creative and has the 
courage and wisdom to say yes when real opportunities arise 
shultz in a prepared statement following three meetings with 
peres praised his commitment and resolve toward finding peace 
formulas giving the foreign minister a boost on which he intends 
to capitalize when he runs against shamir in novembers general 
elections 
but peres asked by reporters whether he viewed the praise as a 
political endorsement said israel and the united states do not 
interfere in each others politics 
the white house asked whether its statement could be construed 
as tilting toward peres in his competition with shamir for israels 
leadership said only our statement stands on its own 
shultz said he was embarking on another mideast shuttle mission 
june 3 because he believes the us plan is the only workable 
alternative to the violence there 
but he conceded the odds against a breakthrough are high 
pessimism and cynicism run deep

us treasury secretary james a baker iii said 
today the world economic outlook was bright but that us trading 
partners needed to move faster with economic reforms 
he said south korea taiwan and other rapidly growing asian 
economies were hurting efforts to correct world trade imbalances by 
failing to deregulate their domestic markets and make them more 
open to foreign exporters and investors 
their trade surpluses particularly in the case of korea and 
taiwan are impeding the adjustment of global imbalances and adding 
to protectionist pressures baker told trade and finance 
ministers from 24 leading industrial nations 
citing the commerce departments report tuesday of an 
unexpectedly large drop in the us march trade deficit baker said 
prospects were good for keeping the world economy on an even keel 
while the nearterm economic situation looks encouraging we 
need to maintain this momentum in the mediumterm he told the 
opening session of a twoday ministerial meeting of the 
organization for economic cooperation and development 
baker praised japan west germany and britain for making 
economic adjustments that have helped to prevent last octobers 
stock market crash from pushing the world economy into a recession 
he added however that the european natios need to reduce their 
high unemployment and promote faster economic growth while japan 
should ensure greater foreign access to its financial markets 
baker said the administration of president reagan had 
contributed to helping the world economy by cutting its budget 
deficit last year boosting exports and increasing the consumer 
savings rate 
he said the us general budget deficit including state and 
local governments had fallen to a level lower than the average 
for the oecd nations as a group 
european and japanese officials struck a similarly upbeat tone 
but they stressed that the reagan administration should do more to 
reduce the federal budget gap 
efforts by the united states to reduce its budget deficit and 
by the european countries to attain robust economic growth are 
indispensable said sousuke uno the japanese foreign minister 
uno echoed bakers call for south korea and other newly 
industrialized nations to play a greater role in efforts to 
coordinate world economic policies 
none of the emerging economic powers in southeast asia which 
also include singapore and hong kong was represented at the oecd 
ministerial meeting 
jacques delors chief executive of the european economic 
community told the meeting these asian nations which he called 
the four asian tigers must be encouraged to join the club 
of rich nations seeking to coordinate policies 
delors also said that while the american economy remained 
buoyant us consumer demand at some stage will slow down 
presenting a challenge to europe to pick up the slack in economic 
growth 
the oecd meeting was expected to focus also on efforts to reduce 
government subsidies to farmers and to cut down on the accumulation 
of farm product surpluses 
baker said the best way to coordinate reforms in agriculture was 
through the global trade liberalization talks known as the uruguay 
round now getting under way in geneva 
all countries however are responsible for the ultimate 
success of the round not simply the industrial nations he said

former labor secretary raymond donovan said 
today that embattled attorney general edwin meese iii should remain 
in office to ensure that the constitutional right of innocence 
until proven guilty is not further weakened 
if the leading law enforcement officer of this country ed 
meese is drummed from that office and run out of that town 
washington and presumption of innocence is further eroded thats 
a danger to the people donovan said in an interview from new 
york on the cbs this morning program 
donovan the first sitting cabinet member to be indicted was 
found innocent in may 1987 of larceny and fraud charges that forced 
him from office in 1985 
criminal investigations of meese have led to unrest and 
resignations at the justice department 
president reagan who donovan said stood by him during his legal 
problems on tuesday reaffirmed his faith in meese comparing the 
attorney generals situation to that of donovan 
the former labor secretary noted the similarities between 
himself and meese 
those who believed in me just as those who believe in ed 
meese know us to be the honorable people that we are but theres 
a certain segment that you can never convince he said 
donovan said reagan is a true friend who doesnt believe in 
shooting his wounded like many others do in that city of

a fire today gutted a soviet passenger liner 
carrying communist youth league members on a visit to japan 
killing 11 people as they slept and injuring dozens of others 
officials said 
the 4870ton priamurye was docked in osaka and many of the 
passengers all believed to be soviet citizens were asleep when 
the fire was discovered shortly before 2 am the ship carried 295 
passengers and 129 crew 
japanese authorities said they began investigating the cause of 
the blaze but the soviets were refusing to cooperate 
they think its not that important to check what happened and 
they even think its strange that we want to investigate said 
yoshihide yasuda spokesman of the osaka prefectural police 
in moscow the tass news agency reported 11 people were killed 
and 26 were injured some critically it gave few details except 
to say all the casualties were soviets 
yasuda also said 11 people were killed but he gave a figure of 
35 injured with 15 hospitalized for smoke inhalation police said 
all of the dead were passengers 
passengers who fled the ship were taken to a junior high school 
gymnasium about a halfmile from the harbor some lined up at five 
hastily installed telephones to call their families 
mama i am safe the ship burned one young woman was 
overheard saying oh wasnt it reported yet in the soviet 
union 
i was in a thirdclass cabin when the smoke came in an 
unidentified male passenger said in a televised interview with the 
japan broadcasting corp i narrowly escaped without taking any of 
my belongings 
another male passenger asked whether he had heard an alarm 
bell replied i was not yet asleep when the fire broke out 
but i could not hear it 
firefighters extinguished the fire 18 hours after it started 
yasuda said the 406foot ship lay listing and blackened in the 
osaka port 
the soviets were arranging for a ship to come to osaka on friday 
to take away the survivors yasuda said 
the priamuryes captain aleksandr yerastov 37 was not on 
board when police and fire officials began their investigation 
yasuda said 
he said police had been unable to question yerastov his crew 
and passengers because soviet consular officials refused to allow 
it 
police want to question 15 security guards among the crew but 
would not be able to stop them from leaving japan if they wished to 
go he said 
in 1982 police could not complete an investigation into a 
nonfatal fire aboard a soviet ship in yokohama and the case was 
closed without a determination of its cause he noted 
the kyodo news service said police were investigating careless 
smoking and an engineroom problem as possible causes of todays 
fire which sent smoke billowing through the vessel and over this 
western japanese harbor 
yasuda refused to comment on possible causes 
police said eight of the dead were found on the lowest of three 
passenger decks where the fire was discovered in an area above the 
engine room 
according to a tentative list issued by the maritime safety 
agency the 11 dead seven men and four women were between the 
ages of 22 and 35 and came from several soviet cities 
the priamurye owned by the far east shipping co of the eastern 
soviet port of vladivostok arrived in osaka on tuesday 
it left vladivostok may 7 and stopped in otaru on japans 
northern island of hokkaido and in tokyo it was to have sailed for 
hiroshima on thursday 
the fire was the third disaster to hit soviet passenger ships in 
just over two years on aug 31 1986 the admiral nakhimov 
collided in the black sea with the freighter pyotr vasyev and 398 
lives were lost 
on feb 16 1986 the soviet cruise liner mikhail lermonov sank

before he died this year the 
longtime head of the nations jewish community apparently 
embezzled millions of dollars in government funds earmarked for 
holocaust survivors his successor said 
a family lawyer said today that he believed werner nachmann the 
former president of the jewish council of west germany stole the 
money to bankroll his troubled business the lawyer said nachmanns 
heirs have filed for bankruptcy 
i am shocked horrified and furious that such a thing could be 
even possible heinz galinski nachmanns successor as council 
president said tuesday 
hessicher rundfunk radio in frankfurt reported that the council 
believes nachmann who died in january embezzled about 19 million 
in holocaust reparations from 1980 to 1987 
galinski confirmed that an investigation had been launched and 
said nachmann was suspected of having stolen more than 6 million 
in interest accumulated from holocaust survivor funds 
he called the radios figure pure speculation 
lawyer peter paepcke who said he had worked for nachmann for a 
decade claimed he discovered the irregularities and estimated 
nachmann had embezzled as much as 156 million 
im afraid that what has been said by the jewish council is by 
and large correct he said by telephone from karlsruhe where 
nachmann lived and owned a textile and raw materials wholesale 
business 
nachmann president of the council since 1965 until his death at 
age 62 of a heart attack was in charge of disbursing the funds to 
holocaust survivors around the world and had unlimited access to 
them the radio report said 
about 236 million was appropriated by the government in 1980 
for holocaust survivors who had not previously made reparations 
claims the funds were in addition to 47 billion already paid by 
west germany to holocaust survivors or victims families 
the radio report said nachmann was suspected of taking interest 
accumulated from the funds and transferring it to among others 
his own company accounts 
learning of this surprised and dismayed the councils 
directorate which immediately informed government leaders 
galinski said in a telephone interview from his berlin office 
this has presented me with the most serious problem i have 
ever faced in my 40 years of working for the jewish community he 
added 
galinski said the jewish council has contracted with financial 
experts to look into the accusations and the investigation is 
expected to take two to three weeks 
im afraid he was getting too overworked and used the money to 
keep the company going he was also under great stress in his job 
as head of the jewish community and the whole thing just overtook 
him paepcke said of nachmann whose company employed 26 people 
he said he had recently filed for bankruptcy for the family 
company and expected the case to be heard in the next week or two 
galinski said the council had asked a civil court in karlsruhe 
to freeze money from nachmanns estate pending an investigation 
into the allegations 
a court spokesman alfred mueller told the ap that no action 
has yet been taken on the councils application 
nachmann had been active in trying to help heal wounds in west 
germany left by the holocaust in which about 6 million jews were 
killed during nazi rule 
nachmanns family fled nazi germany to france in 1938 he

an iranian mediator seeking to end 13 
days of fighting between rival shiite moslem militias said today 
the problem of foreign hostages in lebanon would be solved if the 
combat stopped 
ali mohammed besharati irans acting foreign minister told 
reporters the case of kidnapping of foreigners in lebanon is 
part of the crisis which lebanon is passing through i believe that 
if we could end the state of war currently prevailing then 
definitely the other case would be solved too 
he made the statement in response to reporters questions after 
a meeting with salim hoss lebanons acting prime minister 
besharati would not elaborate on the issue of the hostages most of 
whom are believed held by extremists loyal to iran 
most of the 18 hostages including nine americans are believed 
held in beiruts southern slums where fighting between the 
proiranian hezbollah or party of god and the syrianbacked amal 
has raged since may 6 
lebanese security sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said that during the meeting with hoss besharati sought support 
for an iranian proposal to end the militia battles 
one source said besharati proposed a compromise agreement for 
partial deployment of the syrian army in south beirut to halt the 
bloodshed that has killed 243 people and wounded 762 
the plan under consideration envisages a syrian deployment in 
the northern districts of the southern slums where amal still 
holds positions after being dislodged from 90 percent of the 
16squaremile enclave the source said the source spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
he said the syrians will not deploy in the southern sector 
of the disputed area where hezbollah has its main bases 
besharati would not comment on the report but he said iran was 
seeking the formation of a force to preserve security in south 
beirut 
asked if the syrians would be represented in this force 
besharati said we and our syrian brothers would guarantee this 
force 
it is neither in syrias interest to deploy in south beirut 
nor does the whole population want syria to enter south beirut 
besharati said 
syria has massed 7500 troops and 500 tanks on the southern 
western and northern edges of the zone since the weekend 
on tuesday besharati told brig gen ghazi kenaan syrias 
military intelligence chief in lebanon that iran did not want 
syrian troops deployed in south beirut the two met again today 
we are giving political efforts a chance to solve the problem 
and stop the bleeding in south beirut kenaan said after todays 
meeting but it seems that this effort is not leading to a 
tangible outcome 
he said syrian troops were prepared to storm the slums adding 
the population has requested the deployment of the syrian forces 
to end their ordeal we cannot but meet the peoples pleas 
an amal spokesman said the militias chief nabih berri met 
syrian president hafez assad in damascus on tuesday and returned to 
beirut after assad assured him that syrian forces will enter the 
suburbs 
syria the main power broker in lebanon also is irans main 
arab ally but assads government has recently been alarmed by 
tehrans efforts through hezbollah to dominate lebanons 12 
million shiites the countrys largest single sect 
local news media have reported that the hostages were moved 
since the fighting began 
one report said they were taken to the basement of the iranian 
embassy out of the embattled region the embassy denied that 
another report said they were moved from an exposed hezbollah 
barracks to the home of the militias spokesman on the fringes of 
the zone that could not be verified

willem drees the nations 
longestserving premier and the architect of its comprehensive 
postwar welfare system has died the government announced today 
he was 101 
drees died saturday at his home in the hague and was buried in a 
private ceremony tuesday according to a government statement news 
of his death was withheld at the request of his family the 
statement said 
the cause of death was not disclosed drees had been in 
declining health in recent years 
drees began in politics as a member of the social democratic 
workers party the forerunner of the current opposition labor 
party which he helped found after world war ii 
during 10 years as premier from 19481958 the labor leader 
supervised the nations reemergence into prosperity from the harsh 
fiveyear nazi occupation 
in 1949 he introduced a state pension for all dutch citizens 
over 65 the basis of todays welfare system 
despite some trimming by the fiscal austerity administration of 
the current rightwing premier ruud lubbers the welfare system 
still provides cradletograve care for dutch citizens 
although drees is primarily known as the father of the dutch 
welfare state he coped with the netherlands major foreign policy 
issue as well 
it was his government that waged two dutch colonial wars in the 
late 1940s in an attempt to hold onto the dutch east indies 
but is was drees himself who decided that maintaining a colonial 
empire was a lost cause and ultimately handed over sovereignty of 
almost all of the colony to the new republic of indonesia in 1949 
born into a poor amsterdam family on july 5 1886 drees began 
his political career as a stenographer in the dutch parliament 
he won a seat in the hague city council in 1919 and went to 
parliament in 1933 for the social democrats 
because of his political prominence drees spent part of world 
war ii as a prisoner at buchenwald concentration camp but was 
released because of a severe stomach ailment he became active in 
the dutch resistance 
drees pulled out of the labor party in 1971 claiming the 
partys left wing had betrayed labors social democratic 
foundations 
the issue of whether to deploy nato cruise missiles on dutch 
soil marked drees final public clash with his successors in the 
labor party 
drees under whose tenure the netherlands joined both nato and 
the common market sharply criticized the labor leadership of the 
day for its unconditional opposition to deployment 
lubbers government decided in favor of deployment in 1985 
under last decembers ussoviet agreement to withdraw all 
mediumrange nuclear missiles from europe deployment of the 48 
missiles in dutch soil was called off

a mistrial was declared in the fraud and 
conspiracy trial of a man accused of participating in a kickback 
scheme with the former top education adviser to gov michael s 
dukakis 
a 12member jury deliberated 3 days on one count of conspiracy 
and one of mail fraud against michael freedman on tuesday the 
panel said it could not reach a unanimous verdict 
the key stumbling block appeared to be whether the prosecution 
had proved willfulness on freedmans part in accepting kickback 
money after the jury raised that question tuesday morning us 
district judge douglas woodlock again charged the jury on legal 
issues 
woodlock set a new trial july 11 a new jury will be chosen 
gerard indelicato who became the governors education adviser 
in march 1983 headed the states adult education program at the 
time the alleged scheme got under way 
he pleaded guilty last month to participating in the alleged 
scheme and testified against freedman he is to be sentenced july 
8 assistant us attorney ralph gants declined to say whether 
indelicato would testify in freedmans new trial 
indelicato won a recommendation from prosecutors for a reduced 
sentence in exchange for his cooperation in what gants called an 
ongoing investigation 
indelicato testified that the scheme involved skimming 80000 
from two adult education programs from 1979 to 1983 the money he 
testified was shared among freedman indelicato his brother 
joseph and a fourth conspirator antonio perrotta 
all but freedman have pleaded guilty 
prosecutors agreed to recommend to woodlock that indelicato 
receive a fiveyear prison term and pay an 80000 fine woodlock 
could exceed that if he chose 
indelicato became dukakis education adviser two months after 
the conspiracy alleged by the government ended he testified that 
while he worked for dukakis election bid in 1982 he was receiving 
kickbacks of hundreds of dollars per month from the adult education 
program 
it was a regular income if you will for all of us 
indelicato said 
indelicato said freedman accepted his share and was aware of the 
source of the money but he did not depict freedman as an architect 
of the scheme 
freedmans attorney john burns did not return telephone calls 
seeking comment

the senate tried again today to untie a 
legislative knot that has prevented it from passing a pentagon 
budget bill because of an unrelated amendent allowing the death 
penalty for some drug dealers 
were trying to work out some type of agreement but we dont 
have one yet said senate majority leader robert byrd dwva 
i dont know when it will be done 
byrd and other senators were seeking a compromise that would 
permit approval of the bill which authorizes pentagon spending of 
2995 billion in the fiscal year beginning oct 1 
the fight involves an amendment that would let dealers convicted 
of killing someone to be sentenced to death 
opponents threatened a filibuster against the proposal after 
they threatened to kill it 
sen alfonse damato rny chief author of the amendment has 
refused to remove it from the pentagon bill unless he receives 
assurances from democratic leaders that it will be returned to the 
senate floor later with the promise of a certain vote 
weve been trying to get a vote on this for years damato 
said tuesday 
three antidrug proposals have already been attached to the 
bill including one that would increase the militarys involvement 
in the effort to halt illegal drug trafficking 
weve got to catch them first and then we can take care of 
the penalties this bill with the changes weve made would help 
us catch them let us go ahead said sen sam nunn dga 
chairman of the armed services committee 
in his appeal to damato nunn noted damato was also a major 
sponsor of the amendment ordering the military to help catch drug 
traffickers 
the senate voted easy approval tuesday of a pair of amendents 
expressing displeasure with reports that reagan is negotiating with 
panamas military ruler gen manuel antonio noriega 
noriega has been indicted on drug charges in florida but he has 
refused to quit us economic sanctions have thus far been 
ineffective in forcing him out and there are reports the 
administration is considering dropping the charges in return for 
noriega stepping down 
the senate first voted 950 approval of an amendment by sen 
jesse helms rnc which provides that no us aid be sent to 
panama until noriega leaves power and until reagan certifies that 
no soviet or cuban troops are in the central american nation 
then the senate passed 8610 a resolution offered by senate 
republican leader bob dole of kansas that put the senate on record 
as opposing any deal in which us drugtrafficking charges would 
be dropped 
senate passage will send the measure to a conference committee 
to be reconciled with the separate pentagon budget bill passed a 
week ago by the house 
that bill also includes an antidrug provision stiffer than the 
senate proposal which orders reagan to have the military 
essentially seal off us borders against drug trafficking 
other differences between the bills include

star wars the senate measure proposed 46 billion for 
reagans strategic defense initiative while the house voted 35 
billion reagan had sought 48 billion the most likely compromise 
would grant about 41 billion which would be an increase over the 
current sdi budget of 39 billion 
pay raise the senate approved reagans request for a 43 
percent average pay hike for the nations 21 million uniformed 
military personnel while the house voted for a 4 percent increase 
arms control both bills ban any sdi tests that would violate 
the existing narrow interpretation of the 1972 antiballistic 
missile treaty but the house measure contains two other 
restrictions including a ban on spending for any weapons that 
violate numerical restrictions on various categories of weapons in 
the unratified 1979 salt ii treaty and a ban on all but the 
smallest tests of us nuclear weapons 
base closings the senate bill creates a 15member pentagon

controversial new zero tolerance drug policy 
the yacht was boarded by the us coast guard saturday near 
bimini and searchers discovered a marijuana cigarette aboard 
about eight ounces more of pot was found when the boat docked in 
miami beach the coast guard said

usually takes over such cases refused jurisdiction over the boat 
after reviewing the case of the monkey business the customs 
service feels the matter can be handled best by the coast guard 
said customs spokesman michael sheehan

administrative forfeiture or a fine and released the yacht tuesday 
to its turnberry isle owners said spokesman joe dye 
the zero tolerance program allows confiscation of any vehicle 
plane or vessel carrying even small amounts of drugs 
the 82foot yacht was made famous last year by hart then a 
candidate for the democratic presidential nomination who took a 
trip to bimini with model rice on the vessel harts liaison with

a chemical factory explosion killed three people 
but did not involve fuel for a new longrange nuclear missile as 
the pentagon claimed a foreign ministry spokesman said today 
gennady i gerasimov said in a telephone interview that the 
explosion occurred at 715 am on may 12 at a chemical factory in 
pavlograd about 500 miles southwest of moscow in the ukraine 
three people at the plant were killed and five were hospitalized 
with injuries from the explosion which occurred in a storage area 
for industrial explosives gerasimov said 
soviet media carried no reports about the explosion 
us officials in washington speaking on condition of 
anonymity said tuesday the explosion shut down the only plant in 
the soviet union that makes the main rocket motors for the new 
ss24 intercontinental ballistic missile 
the defense department said in a statement tuesday that the 
explosion destroyed several buildings at a soviet propellant 
plant in pavlograd 
gerasimov said propellant was not involved in the explosion but 
he said he did not know whether the plant produced rocket fuel 
pavlograd with a population of 122000 is about 30 miles east 
of the major industrial city of dnepropetrovsk gerasimov said no 
evacuation of the areas residents was ordered after the explosion 
the pentagon said of the explosion apparently this will 
delay soviet solidpropellant missile programs 
but gerasimov said the explosion did not cause major damage 
its not catastrophic he said 
the ss24 is a large 10warhead weapon that can be launched from 
either underground silos or rail cars the soviets began deploying 
it just last year on rail cars fewer than a dozen are thought to 
have been made operational to date 
the ss24 is one of two icbms in the soviet arsenal that are 
mobile the other is the ss25 which is carried on a truck 
launcher the united states has yet to deploy any mobile longrange 
nuclear missiles although the reagan administration is pressing 
congress to develop a rail launcher for the mx missile 
the accident at the soviet plant occurred just 2 weeks before 
president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev open a 
summit meeting in moscow that is expected to focus on prospects for 
an arms accord that would reduce the number of longrange missiles 
in each nations arsenal 
reagan administration officials contacted by the associated 
press said it would probably take the soviets at least six months 
to resume production of the missile 
this is their only production line for the ss24 main rocket 
motors said one administration source this is a severe 
setback albeit temporary 
we estimate they could be back in production in six months 
but in the meantime its a significant body blow to their icbm 
program 
the sources in washington said they did know what caused the 
blast 
us spy satellites detected the explosion on the night of may 
12 one us source said 
the blast did not involve any nuclear warheads another source 
said but it sure tore that plant up 
theyve got a lot of rebuilding to do the official added 
the sources said they did not know whether the plant in 
assembling the main rocket motor for the ss24 was handling the 
oxidizer ammonium perchlorate a chemical manufactured in a nevada 
plant that was ripped apart by explosions earlier this month 
the plant owned by the pacific engineering amp production co is 
one of two in the united states that make a critical ingredient for 
the solid rocket fuel that powers the space shuttle and various 
american military rockets the nevada site was flattened may 3 by 
tremendous explosions that killed two people and injured 300 others

protesters called for the overthrow 
of president roh taewoo and clashed with police today in 
nationwide demonstrations mourning victims of a 1980 uprising 
police headquarters in seoul reported that 43000 students and 
others joined in demonstrations or sitins at 106 places across the 
nation the number included 39000 students demonstrating at 103 
colleges police said 
in seoul fierce clashes erupted after riot police hurling tear 
gas grenades broke up a march in the streets near city hall waves 
of screaming students charged riot police near myongdong cathedral 
blocking streets and hurling rocks bricks and firebombs 
down with the military dictatorship which committed the 
kwangju massacre the protesters yelled drive out the roh 
murder regime 
clashes also broke out in the provincial cities of sunchon 
pusan chungju and chongju where students and police fought running 
battles in the streets after rallies marking the eighth anniversary 
of the kwangju uprising 
police declined to release any figures on injuries or arrests 
in kwangju long lines of mourners many wearing black ribbons 
filed through mangwoldong cemetery as prayers were offered at 
altars bearing pictures of people killed in the uprising 
punish roh taewoo punish former president chun doohwan 
some protesters shouted during the services in the city 165 miles 
southwest of seoul 
about 10000 people mostly students later marched from the 
cemetery to the plaza in front of the downtown provincial 
government office 
no police were in sight along the route but police inside the 
office fired tear gas scattering the protesters 
when the protesters regrouped some throwing empty cans at the 
police one officer used a loudspeaker to apologize for what he 
called a mistaken firing of tear gas 
the rally then proceeded peacefully swelling at one point to an 
estimated 50000 people with another 20000 to 30000 spectators 
protesters called for daily demonstrations for the rest of the 
week 
the korean news agency yonhap reported that a student angered 
because a campus festival was going ahead on the kwangju 
anniversary set himself on fire in chonan about 30 miles south of 
seoul it said he suffered serious burns 
police were on nationwide alert with about 50000 riot police 
deployed in seoul and other cities and security around government 
offices was stepped up 
the leaders of the three main opposition parties agreed today to 
push for formation of a legislative committee to investigate the 
kwangju uprising the meeting among kim daejung kim youngsam and 
kim jongpil was their first since the combined opposition defeated 
rohs party in national assembly elections on april 26 
at the cemetery relatives of the dead wept at the gravesides 
and put up placards denouncing the roh government and calling for 
retribution mourning prayers were chanted and incense burned on 
the altars 
we must overcome our anguish and sorrow to drive out the 
military dictatorship said chun kyryang a leader of the 
relatives of those killed in the uprising 
roh and chun were top generals who had just seized power in 1980 
when students and citizens took control of kwangju during protests 
in the traditional antigovernment stronghold 
the government says 191 people were killed when troops ended the 
uprising but dissidents claim hundreds died 
roh who took office in february after winning election in 
december has attempted to defuse lingering resentment over kwangju 
by honoring those killed and offering compensation to victims

after seeing the stock and bond markets take a 
tumble over reports of the best us trade performance in three 
years investors and traders may be wondering how much more good 
news the markets can stand 
the commerce department reported tuesday that the trade deficit 
shrank more than 4 billion in march to 97 billion the lowest 
monthly deficit since march 1985 largely on a boom in exports 
the news was good for the dollar which surged against other 
major currencies tuesday the dollars longterm decline apparently 
has paid off by making us exports more attractive and currency 
dealers widely believe monetary authorities arent likely to 
depress its value further 
the dollar retreated today however slipping to around 12543 
japanese yen in midmorning trading in new york from 12575 yen late 
tuesday the us currency also declined to around 17046 west 
german marks from 17065 marks 
to traders on wall street and in the bond market the trade news 
confirmed their recent fears that growing exports reflected strong 
economic growth that could ignite high inflation 
after a brief rally tuesday stock prices slumped the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials which had risen late monday on 
expectations the trade shortfall would narrow fell 2122 points to 
close at 198641 
bond interest rates jumped after initially receding the yield 
on the treasurys closely watched 30year bond jumped to 922 
percent from 911 percent late monday 
wall street continued its decline in early trading today the 
dow average was down 315 points at 198326 at 1030 am edt 
interest rates crept still higher as the yield on the key 
30year bond edged up to 923 percent at around midmorning 
inflation erodes the value of fixedincome investments such as 
bonds and tends to depress bond prices and drive interest rates 
higher 
stock and bond traders saw the 23 percent jump in exports in 
march to an alltime high of 2897 billion as another sign 
that the us economy may be overheating dangerously 
the markets fear the surge in output of export goods could 
aggravate inflation by tightening factory capacity putting more 
spending money into workers pockets and driving up wage costs due 
to shrinking labor pools that could move the federal reserve to 
push interest rates even higher to try to curb growth 
many traders are so worried about inflation that theyd take 
almost any economic number at this point and put a negative cast 
to it said gary schlossberg senior economist for wells fargo 
bank in san francisco 
the last big dose of good economic news also knocked the wind 
out of the markets when the labor department reported that the 
nations unemployment rate in april had dropped to a 14year low 
following the employment report the fed nudged shortterm 
interest rates higher and major us banks responded by raising 
their prime lending rates by half a percentage point to 9 percent 
as a result the good news is bad news syndrome that has 
gripped the financial markets made even an improved trade 
performance cause for alarm 
some economists also were quick to punch holes in the march 
trade report 
the trade deficit for march normally shows a seasonal decline of 
around 1 billion anyway and much of the apparent improvement in 
the latest report was due to transitory factors said john paulus 
chief economist for the investment firm morgan stanley amp co 
although total imports rose only 36 percent to 387 billion 
imports of goods other than oil increased more than 5 percent he 
noted on the export side 600 million of the improvement 
reflected sales of gold bullion to taiwan which has come under 
heavy pressure to reduce its large trade surplus with the united 
states

the last 46 sikh extremists holed up in 
the golden temple surrendered today and emerged with their hands 
up ending a 10day siege of sikhisms holiest shrine officials 
said 
police shot and killed one extremist when he tried to flee 
during the surrender and three others committed suicide by 
swallowing cyanide capsules 
all of them have come out no terrorist is inside the 
complex said punjab state police commander kps gill 
sarabjeet singh administrator of the amritsar district said 
the temple is in control of the security forces 
at least 37 people mostly sikh militants were killed during 
the siege of the 400yearold golden temple the spiritual and 
military stronghold of sikhs waging a campaign of violence for a 
separate sikh nation in punjab state 
the figure does not include the three suicides today and another 
militant who swallowed cyanide when 146 other sikhs surrendered 
sunday 
police searched the surrendering militants including one woman 
and removed and unwound the turbans worn by devout male sikhs who 
do not cut their hair and coil it in a knot under the headgear 
commandos surrounded the extremists who were given water and 
snacks and ordered to sit on the ground in a tin shed near the 
temple complex 
earlier in the day police had said about 60 extremists remained 
in the temple complex but that figure was only an estimate 
since sunday police commandos and paramilitary troops had kept 
up pressure on the complex with burst of machinegun fire 
incendiary bullets and smoke bombs 
the government forces had rooftop bunkers on most buildings 
overlooking the complex commandos had moved inside the walls and 
occupied a dining hall and two brick towers that had been used as 
lookout posts by the militants 
the surrender followed escalating attacks by sikh militants 
elsewhere in punjab in the past 24 hours sikh radicals killed at 
least 38 people including 31 migrant hindu workers late tuesday 
night in revenge for the siege 
about 2800 policemen commandos and paramilitary troops 
surrounded the golden temple complex may 9 after sikh extremists 
fired at police officers who were making an inspection just outside 
the walls 
the indian army raided the golden temple in june 1984 to drive 
out militants and some 1200 people most of them sikhs were 
killed five months later prime minister indira gandhi was 
assassinated by her sikh bodyguards to avenge the attack on the 
temple 
sikhism was formed 500 years ago as an alternative to hinduism 
and islam sikhs form less than 2 percent of indias 800 million 
people but they are a majority in punjab sikhs say they are 
discriminated against by the hindus who account for 82 percent of 
the population 
in the tuesday night attack about 15 sikh extremists attacked 
hindu canal workers at a camp near kharar village 12 miles from 
the state capital of chandigarh police said 
thirtyone workers were killed and 20 injured survivors said 
the gunmen repeatedly shouted that they were taking revenge for the 
golden temple siege 
police superintendent chander shekhar said a note found at the 
scene claimed responsibility for the khalistan commando force one 
of a dozen sikh separatist groups the note said the attack was in 
retaliation for the siege shekhar reported 
seven other slayings tuesday raised to 97 the number of people 
killed by sihk extremists in punjab in the past three days 
about 1060 people have been slain by sikh militants in punjab 
this year in all of 1987 the radicals killed 1030 people

three arab suspects confessed to attacks 
that killed seven people and declared they were waging a terror 
campaign against britain and the united states a senior police 
officer said today 
the arabs who carry lebanese passports told investigators they 
trained in an arab country for the sunday night attacks on a hotel 
and a club said police inspector gen ibrahim ahmed abdelkarim 
abdelkarim whose remarks were carried by the official sudan 
news agency did not identify the suspects or the country 
abdelkarim said the three told police that one man set off 
explosions at the acropol hotel and the other two sprayed the 
nearby sudan club with automatic weapons 
five britons including a family of four and two sudanese died 
at the acropol twentyone people were injured in the hotel and the 
club including three americans and an unspecified number of 
french british dutch and swedes 
abdelkarim said the suspects told interrogators that the 
attacks were directed against american and british interests 
the hotel is a favorite haunt of foreign relief workers and 
journalists and the club is frequented by british and other 
commonwealth nationals 
abdelkarim said the suspects told police they acted on their 
own and had no accomplices he said police believe others were 
involved but he did not say where they are 
the group is bigger than the three in custody and it has 
international and regional branches abdelkarim said 
information minister abdullah mohammed ahmed told reporters the 
three got visas to enter sudan from the embassy in kuwait and came 
to khartoum a few months ago after a stop in west germany he said 
they posed as businessmen 
ahmed said preliminary investigations showed the attackers 
planned to set off the acropol explosions halfway through 
dinnertime when the restaurant would be full 
they planned a simultaneous bombing at the sudan club where a 
party was supposed to be held but for some reason the bomb at 
the hotel exploded before its scheduled time he said 
he said the premature explosion alerted people at the sudan 
club and made possible a partial evacuation before the 
attackers arrived there threw grenades and opened fire with 
submachine guns 
if it were not for the premature explosion at the hotel a 
great massacre would have taken place he said 
ahmed said police discovered the three suspects had worn three 
layers of clothing for the attacks the traditional flowing 
sudanese robe topped by a safari suit and then a sports training 
suit 
he said two attackers were seen throwing away their top garments 
and two submachine guns near the attack site police dogs were used 
to sniff the discarded clothes and track down the two men he 
added the third suspect was apprehended later as he entered a 
rented apartment where the attackers lived the minister said 
a government source who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
attackers claimed foreign relief workers staying at the acropol 
were using their humanitarian work as a cover for espionage 
the source also said the three men intended to carry out other 
terrorist attacks in the capital but refused to give details

the white house and senate leaders pressed the 
chamber today to approve the ussoviet nuclear arms treaty within 
a week so president reagan can take it with him for his moscow 
meeting with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
the democraticcontrolled senate returned to the treaty a day 
after it finally opened debate on the pact signed last dec 8 by 
reagan and gorbachev 
reagan leaves next wednesday for the summit which begins may 29 
white house chief of staff howard baker told reporters it would 
be a major plus if the senate ratifies the treaty before the 
summit 
baker former senate majority leader said he believes the 
odds are better than even the deadline will be met thats up 
to the senate and i hope my former colleagues in the senate move 
forward with speed because to be able to take the ratification 
documents to moscow would be a major plus 
not taking them would be a disappointment it would not be a 
disaster but it would be a disappointment and might have some 
effect on the soviets willingness to go forward to the next 
treaty said baker 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva told reporters 
this treaty can be approved by the time the president leaves if 
we deal only with those serious legitimate amendments that ought 
to be dealt with on this issue 
senate republican leader bob dole rkan said i do hope the 
president will have the treaty when he goes to moscow 
but dole and byrd both said they expect a number of amendments 
to be offered later and they cautioned that the pact could be 
delayed 
as debate opened tuesday sen claiborne pell dri chairman 
of the foreign relations committee urged his colleagues to 
proceed expeditiously to approve the treaty in ample time for 
the summit 
both dole and byrd have predicted that when the senate finally 
votes the pact will be ratified by far more than the 67 votes 
required 
senate floor action had been delayed for more than a week by two 
disputes one over how the united states and the soviets interpret 
the onsite inspection verification provisions and the other 
involving whether socalled futuristic weapons are banned by 
the pact both nations agree they are 
the intermediaterange nuclear forces treaty requires the 
elimination within three years of all missiles with a range of 300 
miles to 3400 miles 
there were no surprises tuesday during opening statements 
republican conservatives including sens jesse helms of north 
carolina and steven symms of idaho criticized the pact and said it 
could damage the security of western europe 
i have a hunch that if ronald reagan were running for 
president this year instead of being in his last year in office he 
would be out on the hustings demanding the senate reject this 
treaty helms contended 
but reagan had a different view the president told reporters at 
the white house im both hopeful and confident that after 
careful consideration the senate will agree that this treaty is a 
diplomatic milestone and will give its consent to united states 
participation 
the treaty vote will be the first time that the senate has acted 
on a ussoviet arms control pact since it ratified the 1972 
antiballistic missile treaty 
the inf pact will also be the first to actually require the 
destruction of weapons past treaties have simply slowed the rate 
of growth of the superpowers arsenals 
sen alan cranston dcalif called the pact the beginning of 
the end of this mindless race to add ever more nuclear weapons 
helms and other critics have readied a series of amendments to 
make significant changes in the treaty 
helms said one of his amendments would require the withdrawal of 
all us military forces from western europe if the inf treaty 
takes effect the united states has about 325000 military 
personnel stationed in europe 
helms argued that the us forces would be defenseless if the 
usbuilt pershing 2 and cruise missiles are removed and he said 
europeans should pay for their own defense 
democratic leaders say that amendment is considered unlikely to 
be approved and they have pushed for rejection of all but a single 
amendment 
that proposal was adopted by the foreign relations committee 
and republicans say it will be the subject of a floor fight as they 
try to remove it 
the amendment would require future presidents to adhere to the 
current interpretation of the inf pact offered by the reagan 
administration 
that amendment arose from a separate dispute over reagans claim 
that his administration can unilaterally change how the united 
states views a separate pact the 1972 abm treaty congressional 
democrats have disagreed with that contention

two grenades exploded early today at the 
home of the correspondent for the soviet news agency tass after a 
threat by a rightwing terrorist squad the correspondent said 
alejandro trouchine said the blast damaged his vehicle and the 
door of the house and broke windows but no one was injured 
windows also shattered in neighboring homes he said 
trouchine who opened the tass office here in january has his 
office at his home 
trouchine said he and his wife elena were at home when the 
blast heard in a large part of the southern part of the city 
occurred at 220 am 
their 12yearold son eugenio left two weeks ago for moscow he 
said 
he said that on may 9 he had received in the mail a communique 
from mano blanca spanish for white hand which said in part 
the mano blanca rises again in the combative life of 
guatemala raises its flags of western christian civilization 
against the new marxist avalanche that keeps company with two 
communist espionage agencies tass and prensa latina for whom we 
have a surprise at the right oportunity the communique said 
prensa latina is the cuban government news agency 
the communique dated april 14 also threatened representatives 
of an exile opposition organization who visited the country a few 
days later parts of it were published in local newspapers at the 
time 
in a dispatch from moscow tass said the explosion gutted the 
tass office but said it happened tuesday night violent attacks on 
soviets and their facilities were seldom reported by the staterun 
media in the past but the current glasnost campaign which 
encourages openness has resulted in quicker acknowledgement of 
some such incidents 
the attack came a week after a failed coup attempt that the 
government of president vinicio cerezo blamed on civilians former 
military officials and dissident officers 
cerezo took office jan 14 1986 as the first civilian 
president since 1970 he was the second civilian to take office in 
more than 30 years of military and militarydominated rule 
mano blanca was most active from the mid1960s until about 1980 
claiming responsibility for bombing and assassinations of people it 
claimed were communists

the chief of navy training has ordered a 
thorough review of procedures involving risk after five instructors 
were accused of forcing a recruit underwater in a pool and 
unintentionally causing his death 
a preliminary hearing will be held next week to determine 
whether the five instructors and the officerincharge lt thomas 
a torchia should be court martialed or whether the charges 
should be dropped a navy spokesman said tuesday 
meanwhile vice admiral nr thunman the chief of navy 
training has instructed commanders of training programs to review 
all their safety procedures said lt brian cullin a navy 
spokesman in washington 
thunman told the new york times he wanted to know are we 
training too close to the edge are we too close to the margin

schools added cullin noting thunmans command covers basic 
training as well as various technical aviation and special 
operations schools 
nonetheless the airsea rescue course in which airman recruit

thunman as saying since it began in 1983 the course has graduated 
1573 sailors

a pool at the navy rescue swimmer school of the naval aviation 
schools command 
initially the navy said mirecki died of cardiopulmonary failure 
during the program which trains navy air crew personnel for search 
and rescue missions 
but mireckis fellow students contacted news media and his 
family to say he was treated unusually harshly the day he died 
instructors forced mirecki into the pool against his will held

in this landlocked country that stroessner a general has ruled 
for 33 years in what is widely regarded as a dictatorship 
the crowd interrupted the roman catholic leader 18 times with 
applause 
a block of 60 chairs reserved for officials of stroessners 
rightist government and governing colorado party sat empty during 
the hourlong gathering in a governmentowned sports stadium 
last week the government abruptly canceled john pauls 
scheduled meeting in the stadium with the builders of society 
a churchpicked collection of cultural business education and 
political leaders that includes opposition figures 
it later backed down after the vatican protested such a 
government ban would have been unprecedented in this pontiffs 37 
foreign tours 
as the stadium filled in the hours leading up to the popes 
arrival an hour late people chanted antigovernment slogans and 
sang folk songs several speakers addressed the exuberant crowd 
denouncing repression 
it is impossible to speak of true liberty and even less of 
democracy where there is no real participation by all citizens in 
making the great decisions that affect the life and future of the 
nation he told the crowd 
a small group sat through the speech wearing mock handcuffs and 
gags 
among those attending was domingo laino leader of the 
centerleft authentic liberal radical party one of four political 
groups the government does not allow to participate in elections 
laino drew wild cheers when he was greeted and embraced by local 
bishops 
as the pope departed the crowd broke into the chant dear 
john paul the people are banned 
on monday stroessner told the pope that paraguay enjoys full 
democracy and that its citizens flourish under his lawandorder 
policies 
stroessner 75 took power in a 1954 coup and last february was 
elected to an eighth straight term as head of this nation of 38 
million in balloting opppositon leaders called rigged 
on tuesday the pope met with about 5000 native indians in 
mariscal estigarribia 340 miles northwest of asuncion 
white ranchers have taken away our land burned our houses and 
divided our communities said rene ramirez of the maskoy tribe 
cattle are more important than we are 
the pontiff on tuesday also said mass in villarrica a farm 
center 100 miles southeast of asuncion he denounced the 
exploitation of latin americas peasant farmers telling 350000 
campesinos not to be resigned to poverty 
paraguays authoritarian government has harshly repressed

about 2000 teenagers rampaged through a 
resettlement camp to protest a government decision to draft them 
into military service the defense minister said wednesday 
the youths burned down huts at the kambi lombilo camp in the 
central zambian city of ndola on monday and smashed furniture said 
gen malimba masheke

centers for jobless youth in cities and towns

lusaka the zambian capital that the rioters destroyed makeshift 
homes they had built themselves when they first arrived 
camps were established last month in lusaka and ndola to 
accommodate 5000 jobless boys and girls from zambias crowded 
urban areas

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the nation 
may 16 
baltimore sun on the inf treaty 
having cleared away obstacles to the inf treaty in negotiations 
with the soviet union the reagan administration now faces even 
tougher bargaining with the united states senate 
the administration deserves to lose this faceoff with the 
senate for two key reasons first its attempt to reinterpret the 
1972 anitballistic missile treaty in order to promote the 
strategic defense initiative is so obviously contrary to law and 
custom that it cannot bear close scrutiny second the senates 
need to reassert its constitutional treaty powers so obviously 
outweighs president reagans desire for a pro forma diplomatic 
ceremony with soviet general secretary mikhail gorbachev that the 
white house is bound to blink 
humiliation of the president is hardly a wise gesture before the 
summit therefore american citizens have a right to expect the 
executive and legislative branches to work out some facesaving 
language to cover an administration retreat on the abm issue 
at no point should the senate withdraw from its insistence that 
treaty testimony offered by an incumbent administration is binding 
on future administrations

the long beach calif presstelegram on presidential aides 
memoirs 
now that larry speakes and don regan have sullied the 
administration with books about their white house experiences some 
argue that such kissandtell revelations should be delayed until a 
president has left office 
regans response to that is that nancy reagan didnt wait that 
long to have him fired 
his tone is petulant but regan has a point 
and that suggests that this president and future presidents 
ought to have a friendly chat with key appointees in the future it 
seems fair enough to ask them to delay any potentially damaging 
revelations until the president has left office 
presidential appointees including don regan are almost 
without exception decent men and women who would honor such a 
request unless strong considerations of conscience or national 
security were involved 
friendly agreements for the duration of a presidents time in 
office ought to allow the chief executive to go about the job 
without fear that associates will stab him in the back before its 
done

the columbia mo daily tribune on george bush 
george bush is emerging from the vice presidency as the 
quintessential faithful dog who never even barks let alone bites 
his master 
judging from the public comments bush has made over the past 7 
years you would think president reagan has never uttered a word 
or had a thought that was not 100 percent in keeping with bushs 
own feelings 
however its a wellknown political fact that personal 
popularity does not transfer just because candidate two might say 
he will do everything precisely as his popular predecessor would 
candidate ones voter strength will never be passed along intact 
 
the only way for bush to shed this image is to assert himself 
instead of depending on the actions of others bush will have to 
prove by his actions and words what he is 
we know george bush is a nice man with good experience in 
government we believe he is a good organizer of administrative 
affairs but after all this time in public office and on the 
campaign trail he has yet to show us what he really stands for

westerly ri sun on raising the speed limit from 55 mph to 65 
mph 
to those who think the 65 mph law is a killer transportation 
secretary jim burnley must look like a devils advocate he says 
the traffic death rate has not been worsened 
this flies in the face of the national safety councils view 
that higher speeds are causing more deaths 
burnley promises supportive data in a forthcoming report to 
congress we shall see 
meanwhile he does make one excellent point that enforcement 
of speed limits is of crucial importance in holding down fatalities 
but there is this house testimony by judith stone of the 
national safety council to think about we have a very strong and 
clear indication from across the nation that average speeds have 
increased and more people are dying and sustaining more severe 
injuries on these roads

the huntington wva heralddispatch on airplane safety 
the two aloha airlines pilots who safely landed a boeing 737 
after a large section of fuselage blew away were honored in 
ceremonies at the white house and rightly so 
but while the pilots garner their welldeserved praise federal 
investigators are working behind the scenes to figure out the 
bizarre mishaps cause and their initial findings are far from 
reassuring 
the federal aviation administration has disclosed that aloha 
received warnings months ago that its aging planes needed better 
maintenance 
obviously not only aloha but all the nations airlines need to 
pay closer attention to the faas warnings of potential problems 
and it well may be that airlines worried about their 
profitloss statements are trying to squeeze too much life out of 
their older planes

dallas times herald on outlawing plastic weapons 
the senate judiciary committee took a reasonable necessary and 
courageous stand in unanimously approving legislation that would 
ban plastic guns and any other firearms that elude metal detectors 
and xray machines 
this nation cannot afford to permit the manufacture or sale of 
these kinds of weapons 
the committees voice vote clears the ban for action on the 
senate floor congress should waste no time in protecting americans 
from lethal guns that could be easily smuggled aboard airlines 
terrorists do not deserve to have any friends in washington 
we hope that the willingness of congressional leaders to take a 
stand in the case of plastic guns despite threats of a political 
retaliation at the polls will lead to a candid and courageous 
review of a whole series of guncontrol regulations 
there must be a balance between sanity and total surrender

worthington minn daily globe on president reagans 
endorsement of george bush 
that was some endorsement president reagan gave vice president 
george bush 
for an opener the president waited until pat robertson 
terminated his candidacy and there was no one but bush remaining in 
the republican race 
the president didnt devote his remarks primarily to the bush 
candidacy he talked on other subjects for 15 minutes and then 
appended a threesentence comment on bush at the end of his address 
to top it all off reagan said george bosh in one of the 
three references he made to the vice president during the course of 
his speech 
its an expansive endorsement and a glowing tribute in the 
context of what the president has said in support of other 
candidates jesse jackson or michael dukakis

albuquerque nm journal editorial on panamas gen noriega 
offering to trade us criminal charges for an agreement that 
panamanian gen manuel antonio noriega would relinquish control of 
his government puts us justice up for sale or trade 
the reagan administration has been discussing a deal that could 
result in the dropping of drug trafficking charges against noriega 
if the general gives up his power by august 
the administration describes its plan to coax noriega to step 
down as diplomatic plea bargaining thus devaluing us justice 
and telling criminals that criminal charges can be negotiated away 
in the embassy back room 
criminal charges should not be political nor negotiable outside 
the context of official court proceedings not even by the white 
house

new jersey herald newton nj on new boxing regulations 
the sport of boxing is safer and its integrity less susceptible 
thanks to a bill signed into law that affords participants 
increased medical protection and mandates them and their staffs to 
undergo background checks to ensure there are no ties with 
organized crime 
the law requires two physicians be present at ringside and all 
boxers undergo a physical examination after every bout in 
addition fighters are required to carry medical insurance 
coverage 
currently only promoters sponsoring bouts in casinos are 
checked the new law requires that all promoters managers and 
trainers submit to annual background checks 
the reforms are a step in the right direction to ensure boxing 
is safer and not tainted by people who might want to control the 
outcomes of bouts

white house chief of staff howard h baker jr 
said wednesday he never has seen president reagan make a policy 
decision based on astrology or due to the influence of first lady 
nancy reagan 
baker in a brief exchange with reporters took issue with his 
predecessor donald t regan who claimed in his book for the 
record that astrological forecasts were used by the first lady to 
determine white house events and that she played a key role in 
ousting numerous administration officials 
i am with the president every day most of the day and i can 
tell you firsthand ive never seen any decision certainly no 
policy decision that has ever been affected either by the first 
ladys input or by astrology baker said 
at a brief news conference on tuesday the president said he did 
not use astrology to guide my life but he sidestepped the 
question of whether he believed in it or not 
i dont know enough about it to say is there something to 
it the president said 
regans book also painted a picture of an incurious passive 
chief executive manipulated by a strongwilled wife and 
mediaconscious staff 
baker acknowledged that the president does have a great 
respect for the first ladys judgment she has good judgment she 
has good instincts and intuition 
but the chief of staff argued that regan overplayed the 
passivity of the president 
ronald reagan is president of the united states and i can 
tell you that after a year and a half on this job he is president 
he knows hes president he acts like a president he likes being 
president and hes a good president baker said 
while not mentioning regans name directly baker said tellall 
books should not be written he indirectly criticized the former 
chief of staff for breaching a code of confidentiality that should 
accompany such highlevel positions 
he added that he doesnt intend to write a book 
i dont think you ought to write those books i think when you 
take a job like this that theres at least an implied commitment 
that youre not going to write books like that baker said 
adding if youre in daily intimate contact with the president 
in a decisionmaking process i think theres an obligation to 
treat that discreetly and confidentially 
baker was asked to succeed regan in the aftermath of the 
revelations of the irancontra arms and money affair in his book 
regan contends mrs reagan took part in the effort to drive him 
from the white house and discusses how he resigned in a huff after 
he learned in a news report that baker had been named to the post

sen lowell weicker traveling to 
connecticut with president reagan today labeled attorney general 
edwin meese iii a son of a bitch 
taking advantage of the chance to present his views to the small 
pool of reporters who accompany reagan on the presidential jet 
weicker said 
ive been battling the sonofabitch ever since he became 
attorney general i dont like him 
weickers comments came in the context of his answer to 
reporters questions about whether meese should resign 
the connecticut republican who long has been at odds with the 
administration on a variety of issues said i want to see the 
report of the special prosecutor first 
reagan often invites members of congress to accompany him on 
trips to their states and districts as a matter of presidential 
courtesy sen christopher dodd dconn also traveled on the 
presidential aircraft today 
for his part reagan said that critics of his embattled 
attorney general were trying to make a fuss over him but that 
none of the charges against him had been substantiated 
reagan commented on meeses troubles as he sat down to lunch 
with cadets on the coast guard cutter vigorous at the services 
new london conn academy before making a speech about illegal 
drug trafficking 
reagan toured the cutter and inspecting goods seized in drug 
raids including sawedoff shotguns automatic weapons and 
fivekilogram of cocaine 
when he sat down to lunch with the cadets a reporter said there 
appeared to be a rebellion within conservative ranks about meese 
and the attorney generals firing of his spokesman terry eastland 
a favorite of the right wing 
i think some will keep on trying to make a fuss over him 
reagan said of meese so far theyre all empty charges

michael dukakis continuing his march 
toward the democratic nomination with a lopsided win in the oregon 
primary touted himself as a candidate who can win the 
presidency democratic rival jesse jackson however warned his 
rival not to count him out yet 
vice president george bush who already has a mathematical lock 
on the republican nomination picked up all 32 delegates in oregon 
but bush was getting less attention for winning another primary 
than for trailing dukakis in a series of surveys 
and kansas sen bob dole who dropped out of the republican race 
back in march skimmed off nearly a fifth of the vote in oregon it 
doesnt do dole any good at this point but it points to weakness 
that could hurt bush in november 
the primary season is now in its final phase pointing toward 
the closing contests june 7 in california new jersey new mexico 
and montana 
jackson has vowed to make an allout effort in california which 
offers him a last chance to come out a winner before the democratic 
convention in july he headed to the state while the votes were 
being counted in oregon and vowed to press on 
the support were getting from the public is a mandate for 
change and we will continue he told supporters tuesday night at 
a hollywood hotel we will not surrender 
dukakis who captured 55 percent of the vote to jacksons 38 
percent in oregon issued a victory statement that looked to the 
coming primary contests but that also tacitly assumed that he 
would be the one to face bush in the fall 
we will campaign hard for victories in california new jersey 
montana and new mexico on june 7 and for the white house next 
fall said the massachusetts governor who has won nine of the 
last 10 primary contests 
today the people of oregon voted for change he said they 
voted for a candidate who can win the presidency 
a pair of polls out today suggested dukakis was widening his 
lead over bush in a hypothetical matchup a poll by the los angeles 
times indicated that in california dukakis had a 17point lead 
over the vice president in that survey dukakis had 53 percent to 
bushs 36 percent with 11 percent undecided 
the times poll questioned 2202 californians by telephone over 
six days ending monday night with a margin of error of 3 
percentage points 
another poll a nationwide gallup survey commissioned by the 
boston globe and boston stations weii and wcvb suggested dukakis 
was ahead of bush 54 percent to 38 percent the gallup survey was 
based on telephone interviews conducted may 1315 with 1204 
registered voters with a sampling error of 3 percentage points 
bush asked about a poll from a day earlier by cbs news and the 
new york times which also showed dukakis with a doubledigit lead 
acknowledged that the numbers werent encouraging 
no they werent he said but the vice president quickly 
pointed to surveys taken just before the new hampshire primary 
which he won handily that suggested he was well behind and he 
said he hasnt really gone headtohead with his democratic rival 
yet although he and dukakis have frequently exchanged barbs 
the thing hasnt really started in terms of democrats versus 
republicans and we havent gotten any of that in focus and it wont 
be until after the convention bush said as he campaigned in 
california 
the vice president who has always made much of his role as 
president reagans loyal second conceded that controversies in the 
administration may be hurting him

construction of singlefamily homes dipped in 
april the government said wednesday providing evidence that 
higher mortgage interest rates may be dampening building activity 
the commerce department said singlefamily home building dropped 
69 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 110 million 
units last month 
construction of multifamily units which swing widely from 
month to month soared by 233 percent to a rate of 466000 to 
offset the singlefamily decline and produce an overall increase of 
05 percent 
economists said construction was not at unhealthy levels 
particularly when compared with a sharp slump in december and 
january but they added that the increase in apartment building was 
probably an aberration and that rising mortgage interest rates 
likely would depress singlefamily construction 
the singlefamily number is not a bad number but i think its 
an indication that as rates rise through the year its going to 
impact the housing market said martin a regalia chief 
economist of the national council of savings institutions 
rates on 30year fixedrate mortgages were just under 10 
percent through march but began edging up in april and averaged 
104 percent last week 
david seiders chief economist of the national association of 
home builders said investor fears of inflation pushed interest 
rates higher earlier this year than many analysts anticipated 
despite that he said surveys of home builders in may showed that 
buying is holding up fairly well 
our major concern for the rest of the year is what this 
inflation paranoia in the market is going to mean seiders added 
were hoping that the inflation numbers themselves as they 
come in will be pretty orderly and that this psychology will 
break 
the overall 05 percent increase last month to 156 million 
units at seasonally adjusted annual rate followed gains of 23 
percent in march and 99 percent in february but housing activity 
was still 45 percent below last year in part because of declines 
in december and january 
housing starts plummeted 158 percent in december and fell 12 
percent in january analysts attributed the slump to builders fear 
that the october stock market crash would discourage home buyers 
since then the economy has proved to be robust and interest rates 
have emerged as the new threat to housing activity 
housing permits considered a good sign of future construction 
activity fell 41 percent in april to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 142 million units singlefamily permits fell 68 percent 
while multifamily units rose 22 percent 
i dont think this is the start of a big multifamily 
construction boom said mark obrinsky an economist with the us 
league of savings institutions vacancy rates are still way too 
high in most parts of the country particularly in the south 
the vacancy rate for rental housing was 8 percent during the 
first three months of 1988 well above the level of 5 percent to 6 
percent that prevailed through the 1970s and the first half of the 
1980s the new tax law that took effect last year has also 
depressed multifamily construction by removing many of the 
benefits of investing in real estate 
the overall april increase in housing starts was paced by a 224 
percent rise in the midwest and a 52 percent climb in the south 
housing starts fell by 89 percent in the northeast and 130 
percent in the west 
obrinsky said that if the gains in the midwest continue it may 
be an indication that the exportdriven improvement in 
manufacturing is transforming the rust belt into if not an 
economic hot spot at least a warm spot

white house chief of staff howard h baker jr 
said today he is reasonably hopeful that the united states will 
succeed in removing panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega from 
power 
baker spoke with reporters one day after president reagan said 
at a surprise news conference that he will not strike a deal that 
would whitewash anyone in panama 
both the president and his chief of staff declined to discuss 
reports that the united states has offered to drop drug trafficking 
charges against noriega 
the negotiations are underway said baker our policy is 
that noriega must go and indeed that remains our commitment 
reagan asked today as he visited the coast guard academy in new 
london conn about bakers comment that he is hopeful of getting 
noriega to give up power the president replied thats what 
were hoping and what were trying to achieve 
he said he did not know how the negotiations would be affected 
by tuesdays 8610 vote in the senate for a nonbinding resolution 
expressing opposition to any negotiations for a deal that would 
involve dropping the indictment 
i understand the frustration that was expressed by the senate 
and i am sympathetic to that said baker a former senate 
republican leader 
the fact remains that the administration has a firm fixed 
policy that noriega must go and we are working very hard to see 
that that happens were working very hard to see that that 
happens i am reasonably hopeful that well get that result but we 
dont have it yet 
the idea of indicting the leaders of foreign governments is 
fairly new baker said its not one of the traditional 
instruments of foreign policy but it certainly is something that 
has had a concentrating effect on noriegas mind apparently so by 
whatever means were going to use that to our advantage to try to 
implement administration policy which is to see that noriega 
leaves power leaves the country and paves the way for democratic 
rule in that nation 
questions about noriega and embattled attorney general edwin 
meese iii dominated reagans meeting with reporters tuesday reagan 
also said no decisions were made at the white house on the basis of 
astrological advice to first lady nancy reagan 
when asked whether he believed in astrology himself however he 
paused and replied i dont guide my life by it but i wont 
answer the question the other way because i dont know enough about 
it to say is there something to it or not 
of meese the president said i think that theres been a 
wave and for quite a long time in which accusation or 
allegation is taken to mean conviction and theres been too much 
of that 
i think that for him to step aside would be what he himself 
once said that he would then live for the rest of his life under 
this cloud with nothing that had ever been proven 
the justice department has been rocked in recent weeks by unrest 
and resignations stemming from criminal investigations of meeses 
affairs 
on panama reagan said much of what has been written about the 
negotiations had been based on some kind of leaks or 
misinformation because there are no facts to sustain it 
in refusing to discuss the negotiations reagan said it would 
be foolish to do so some things you have to keep to yourself when 
youre arguing with someone else 
reagan also denied the administration knew long ago that noriega 
was involved in drug trafficking and chose not to act on the 
knowledge 
there had been some rumors but no one ever received or 
could get evidence to substantiate those rumors the president 
said 
reagan opened his news conference with a statement applauding 
the agreement to start senate debate on the ussoviet 
intermediaterange arms treaty he described the march trade 
figures which showed a dramatic drop in the monthly deficit in the 
balance of exports and imports as the best news on this front 
since march of 1985 
reagans last regularly scheduled news conference was feb 24

mayor bud clark easily defeated 10 
challengers for his job but uncounted absentee ballots may decide 
whether the eccentric tavern owner will face a runoff in his bid 
for a second term 
clark needed one vote more than 50 percent of the total votes 
cast tuesday to win reelection outright but final unofficial 
results today showed he had only 498 percent 
clark with 59810 votes was followed by former police chief 
ron still with 40960 or 335 percent and former city 
commissioner lloyd anderson with 12693 or 106 percent former 
police chief jim davis was a distant fourth with 4832 or 4 
percent 
jim dodson a spokesman for the multnomah county elections 
office said absentee ballots would be counted by friday he said 
he had no idea how many people had cast absentee votes 
a runoff in november would be between the top two votegetters 
also tuesday voters statewide approved a law requiring drivers 
and passengers of motorcycles and mopeds to wear helmets with 
1959 of the states 2338 precincts reported the helmet proposal 
was ahead by 381488 or 68 percent to 178827 or 32 percent 
clark shocked the city four years ago by unseating incumbent 
frank ivancie despite a series of crises that plagued the first 
half of his term polls showed him far ahead of the other 
candidates in the nonpartisan race 
clark decided to wait for complete returns before making a 
victory speech 
we led the way in showing you could upset an incumbent and 
now it looks like everyone wants to do the same thing clark said 
in a telephone interview i just want to get back to running the 
city 
still said he was confident there would be a runoff the last 
runoff in a portland mayoral race was in 1956 when terry schrunk 
defeated incumbent fred peterson 
during clarks first two years in office still and another 
police chief resigned and davis was fired in a dispute over a 
police bureau audit 
the other chief to resign was penny harrington who left after 
16 months as the first female chief of a bigcity police department 
in the united states her resignation came a day after a commission 
that clark appointed issued a report that criticized her management 
and recommended that she be replaced 
portlands crime rate was the major issue in the mayors race 
but clarks opponents apparently were unable to convince voters 
that he was directly responsible for the crime problem clark said 
lowering the crime rate would be the top priority of his second 
term 
clark 57 has been criticized for his eccentricities but there 
were few campaign attacks on his personality his trademark 
whoop whoop cry is a staple of civic functions and the 
bicycling mayor has chronicled his political career with an 
everpresent camera

federal judge alcee l hastings of miami told 
house investigators today that i am not guilty but i am not 
free and demanded that they drop impeachment proceedings and 
clear his name of misconduct charges brought by fellow judges 
hastings said he was the first federal judge in us history to 
be threatened with impeachment after his acquittal of criminal 
charges at a jury trial 
they found me not guilty of crimes i never committed 
hastings told the house judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice 
which opened impeachment hearings today 
let me make it very very clear he said in sworn testimony 
i did not receive a bribe i did not obstruct justice i have not 
betrayed the integrity of my office i am not guilty but i am not 
free 
hastings denounced a report by a special fivejudge panel of the 
11th us circuit court of appeals accusing him of lying under oath 
and manufacturing evidence at his bribery trial in 1983 
i ask you in the name of decency i ask you in the name of 
justice the american jury system and the american way of life i 
beg you i beseech you hell no i demand of you that you set me 
free 
hastings the first black federal judge in florida was 
acquitted five years ago of conspiring to solicit a 150000 bribe 
from two convicted racketeers 
todays hearing began with a review of evidence in the case by 
new york lawyer john doar a former us assistant attorney general 
who supervised the appellate panels investigation 
doar also wrote the panels voluminous report accusing hastings 
of bribery conspiracy and obstruction of justice after a 3year 
investigation that he said involved 2800 documents and testimony 
from 110 witnesses 
the report was given to the house leadership in march 1987 by 
the judicial conference of the united states the chief 
policymaking body of the federal judiciary with the conclusion 
that consideration of impeachment may be warranted 
at the outset of todays hearing rep john conyers jr 
dmich chairman of the subcommittee that has studied the case for 
more than a year said he was deeply troubled that the charges 
against hastings might be racially and politically motivated 
conyers said the impeachment proceedings were exceedingly 
difficult and trying because hastings already has been acquitted 
of criminal charges and because he is a black federal judge 
hastings sat silently with his lawyers at a side table as 
conyers said the subcommittee had taken cognizance of racially 
motivated conduct in this country for many many years 
particularly in the criminal justice system 
we are not unaware or naive about the troubling matters that 
hover over this particular hearing today he said 
conyers charged that the federal courts have become 
conservatized and in some instances politicized under the 
reagan administration referring to the justice department he 
added never have we known an administration that has so 
politicized the administration of law 
rep george gekas of pennsylvania ranking republican on the 
panel declared that never has there been a hint that any 
part of this inquiry was based on racial motivations 
he urged his colleagues to keep racial or political 
considerations from influencing the proceedings and to concentrate 
on its factfinding mission in the case 
last april the supreme court rejected a move by hastings to 
block the impeachment inquiry as unlawful 
the high court left intact a 1980 law under which hastings 
fellow judges asked the house to consider impeaching him for 
alleged judicial misconduct the justices also refused to block 
release of confidential grand jury documents concerning hastings to 
the judiciary panel 
a team of house lawyers has been studying a 381page report 
prepared by a special fivejudge panel of the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals in atlanta which concluded there was clear and 
convincing evidence that hastings conspired with washington 
lawyer william a borders jr to solicit a bribe from two 
racketeers in exchange for a promise of lenient sentences 
in addition the panel accused hastings of trying to conceal the 
conspiracy by giving false testimony and fabricating evidence at 
his highly publicized trial in miami four years ago 
hastings was acquitted of the briberyconspiracy charges but 
borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 on charges of 
conspiring to arrange the alleged bribe from convicted racketeers 
frank and tom romano 
the judicial panel concluded that hastings attempted to 
corruptly use his office for personal gain its report said 
such conduct cannot be excused or condoned even after judge 
hastings has been acquitted of the criminal charges 
an impeachment resolution against hastings has been introduced 
by reps henry j hyde rill and f james sensenbrenner rwis 
hastings who was nominated by president carter in 1979 had 
claimed previously that his prosecution was racially and 
politically motivated if i were white i wouldnt be facing 
impeachment he said 
if the full house votes impeachment the senate would conduct a 
trial conviction by the senate would result in hastings removal 
from the federal bench

a 350acre scottish island with 
rolling pastures ruins of a chapel two fourbedroom farmhouses 
and a harbor was offered for sale wednesday for more than 280000 
savills an edinburgh real estate firm said the island of pabay 
in scotlands western isles is surrounded by seas teeming with 
seals porpoises and otters was once a refuge for pirates and has 
been inhabited since the 13th century 
the island is licensed by the post office to produce its own 
stamps and because it has no postal workers its handful of 
inhabitants are paid to collect their mail from a post office on 
the isle of skye two miles away 
savills advertised it as ideal for someone seeking a sanctuary 
from the pressures of modern life it asked for offers of more than 
280000 
for that money you would be lucky to find a onebedroom flat 
in central london said spokesman andrew smith but thats the 
way the property market is 
there are certain limitations on getting to it but if you 
want a bit of privacy its the ideal situation he said 
the island currently is a commercial farm and the owners 
identity has not been disclosed smith said 
religious persecution on the mainland brought the islands 
earliest settlers seeking sanctuary 700 years ago he said by 
1549 scottish writer dean munro described it as full of woods 
good for fishing and a main shelter for thieves and cutthroats

the soviet ambassador said in a letter published 
wednesday that moscow has lost radio contact with one of its 
nuclearpowered reconnaissance satellites 
british legislator irvine patnick said he wrote to the 
ambassador leonid zamyatin after hearing news reports that cosmos 
1900 which tracks us naval movements could crash in britain and 
bring significant amounts of nuclear radiation with it 
he said zamyatin apparently wanted to allay any fears when he 
wrote that the satellite continues its oriented flight and all 
major systems operate according to program 
as for radiation zamyatin wrote that cosmos 1900 is equipped 
with the systems providing radiological security on the termination 
of the flight 
concern over the satellites nuclear payload has been mounting 
since the official soviet news agency tass reported may 11 that it 
might fall to earth in august or september 
us experts have claimed that its radioactive components would 
probably not burn up on reentering the atmosphere as tass had 
implied 
the precise effect of the satellites reentry remain a topic 
for debate 
don kerr an expert on military and space technology at the 
international institute for strategic studies in london said the 
satellites small nuclear reactor would absolutely not survive 
reentry intact but some radiation would inevitably cling to the 
satellites parts 
two soviet satellites have fallen to earth before in northern 
canada in 1978 and in the indian ocean in 1983 the canadian 
satellite gave off small amounts of radiation

the attorney general of wisconsin told a house 
panel wednesday that federal laws money and personnel will be 
needed to keep the peace between chippewa indians and nonindians 
in the northern part of his state 
i am convinced that a greater federal presence with more 
assurance of aggressive prosecution of those persons interfering 
with federally protected rights will greatly reduce the potential 
for antiindian racists to pursue violence state attorney 
general donald j hanaway said 
the dispute over chippewa hunting and fishing rights in northern 
wisconsin was the focus of a hearing by the house judiciary 
committee on civil rights rep don edwards dcalif is chairman 
and wisconsin republican rep jim sensenbrenner is the ranking 
republican 
sensenbrenner said he was advised by interior secretary donald 
hodel that no current federal money was avaiable for a financial 
settlement between the state and the chippewa 
hanaway said that there is a clear potential for violence in 
the future as a result of court rulings granting substantial 
offreservation hunting and fishing rights based on treaties of 
1837 and 1842 there are six chippewa bands with reservations in 
wisconsin 
the attorney general said a very small and vocal minority in 
northern wisconsin persists in engaging in racist antiindian 
activity under the guise of treaty rights issues 
hanaway and other witnesses said there was nearviolence during 
the last several indian spearfishing seasons prevented only by a 
strong law enforcement presence 
the attorney general said legislation is needed to allow federal 
law enforcement officials to effectively assist state and local 
authorities 
additionally i would urge this committee to support federal 
appropriations to assist states in providing necessasry law 
enforcement service he added 
james h schlender executive administrator of the great lakes 
indian fish and wildlife commission called for federal legislation 
making it a crime to interfere with the exercise of federal treaty 
protected rights 
existing laws both federal and state leave ambiguity as to 
the duties of federal and state law enforcement officials he 
said this ambiguity must be cleared up treaty rights must be 
protected 
referring to the relative calm of the spring spearfishing 
season schlender said a temporary lid appears to have been 
placed upon the boiling pot of hatred in wisconsin against 
indians 
the commission is an intertribal organization of 11 lake 
superior chippewa tribes from wisconsin michigan and minnesota 
in a report to the committee the tribal attorney for the lac du 
flambeau band of lake superior chippewas said northern wisconsin 
has experienced an outpouring of racist backlash which has gone 
well beyond mere opposition to treaty rights 
attorney james m jannetta said its intensity and virulence 
has shocked the chippewa people 
so far the incidents of violence have been minor but as the 
racist reaction builds people of goodwill on both sides wonder how 
long this can remain the case 
jannetta said that in the spring 1988 spearfishing season the 
lac du flambeau faced massive harassment throughout the season 
and it was only an equally massive law enforcement effort that 
protected the physical safety of the spearers

the soviet writers union has decided to create a 
museum to boris pasternak who was forced out of the organization 
for publishing his nobel prizewinning novel doctor zhivago a 
newspaper said wednesday 
the weekly literaturnaya gazeta said the secretariat of the 
writers union had decided to turn pasternaks house in the rural 
writers colony of peredelkino just west of moscow into a museum 
it was at that house that pasternak wrote the novel that won him 
the 1957 nobel prize for literature 
pasternak was forced to turn down the prize and died in disgrace 
in 1960 
but the soviet union is reevaluating pasternak under mikhail s 
gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater openness on selected 
topics 
poet andrei voznesensky told the newspaper that pasternak name 
remains in the epicenter of a literary struggle and that honors 
now bestowed on him were possible only because of glasnost 
pasternak was reinstated to the writers union in february 1987 
and doctor zhivago was published earlier this year in the 
literary journal novy mir

a single lottery to draw times for using the protest area 
solves some problems but not others said gene guerrero

right before the convention that means no one can plan

a policeman accused by black 
squatters of organizing vigilante gangs was killed in a shootout 
with a suicidal white man far from the black townships where the 
officer usually worked 
warrant officer hendrick barnard a cape town policeman for 20 
years was one of two officers killed tuesday night by a former 
mental patient who had been threatening to commit suicide at his 
house 
the 30yearold man identified as christopher du plooy later 
was killed by officers who stormed the house in fish hoek a 
coastal town on the cape peninsula 
barnard who was white usually worked in impoverished black 
townships and squatter camps 15 miles away on the cape flats east 
of cape town last year he was injured in a hand grenade attack in 
one township 
in the past 10 years many blacks said barnard was connected 
with attacks and factional fighting aimed at intimidating or 
displacing squatters 
some squatters have banded together to resist attempts to 
relocate them and the government considers other squatter 
communities strongholds of antiapartheid militants 
barnard has been mentioned frequently in an ongoing court action 
filed by squatters who were burned out of their shacks in a section 
of the crossroads squatter complex in 1986 
the plaintiffs allege that barnard and other officers either 
encouraged or condoned an onslaught on the squatter camp by black 
vigilantes some witnesses have testified they saw barnard in a van 
leading a force of 1000 vigilantes and others say they saw him 
distributing incendiary devices 
scores of people were killed and more than 70000 burned out of 
their homes during a series of attacks at crossroads in may and 
june 1986 
barnard in a sworn affidavit said police tried to stop the 
violence but were unable to move through the densely packed 
shanties in vehicles and considered it too dangerous to go on foot 
barnard was given a commendation in 1983 for his work in 
cracking a black car theft and housebreaking ring in 1986 after 
complaints by blacks about barnard intensified his superiors took 
the unusual step of introducing him to newsmen and allowing him to 
answer questions 
his official police record says he frequently worked in 
exceedingly dangerous circumstances during which he at times barely 
escaped with his life

pat robertson said wednesday that 
us intelligence cannot counter his claim there might be soviet 
missiles in cuba repeating a neverproven contention from his 
failed republican presidential campaign 
on the second day of his return to his christian broadcasting 
networks 700 club program robertson said he was victimized by 
the media that was playing gotcha with his campaign 
it isnt so much to learn what it is youve got to say but 
sort of can we pick a fact that is erronous and can we play i 
gotcha he said of the medias reporting of his statements 
robertson stunned his rivals when he said during a february 
campaign debate that the soviets maintained nuclear missiles in 
cuba 
i never claimed to have proof the missiles were there he 
said wednesday 
during the debate robertson said information came to me that 
the soviets in violation of the socalled khrushchevkennedy 
accords have put some ss4s and 5s in cuba 
during the televised appearance robertson offered pictures and 
testimony from unnamed sources that he said led to the conclusion 
that there was a possibility that the missiles existed asked why 
the information was not better publicized robertson said the 
material was being deliberately withheld to aid in the ratification 
of the ussoviet missile treaty 
the fix is in thats why the deal has been signed and 
everybody wants it to go through he said 
likewise robertson said the campaign statement that he knew the 
location of american hostages was exaggerated by the media 
robertson said the statement was a throwaway line at the end of 
an interview and that cbn knew only the general location of some 
hostages 
robertson said he would show videotapes on thursday of 
depositions taken in his 33 million libel suit against former rep 
pete mccloskey the former california congressman charged robertson 
evaded combat duty in the korean war by using his fathers 
influence who was a us senator from virginia

police fired tear gas and smoke bombs 
wednesday to halt a rally and march to the us embassy by 
protesters demanding that deposed president ferdinand marcos be 
allowed to return for his mothers funeral 
organizers said at least four women and two children were hurt 
police said there were minor injuries to several demonstrators but 
did not give a figure 
about 5000 demonstrators rallied to urge the government allow 
the exiled marcos to return to attend the funeral of his mother 
josefa edralinmarcos who died may 4 
a breakaway group of 2000 demonstrators chanting if you want 
trouble we will give you trouble later marched toward the 
embassy and were blocked near city hall by 50 policemen 
journalists said 
a police spokesman said the demonstrators were dispersed when 
they started throwing stones at the officers who fought back with 
truncheons and later used tear gas and smoke bombs to disperse the 
marchers 
the marchers later regrouped in the central bonifacio square to 
protest the dispersal 
rows of barbed wire and 400 policemen and soldiers backed by 
four firetrucks and two water cannons blocked all roads leading to 
the presidential palace 
any dispersal is a curtailment of the peoples right to 
peaceably assemble and march said rally leader salvador panelo 
it only demonstrates the weakness of this government because it 
is afraid of the peoples voice 
col emiliano templo deputy commander of the capital command 
allowed protesters to hold a protest vigil wednesday night 
about 100 marcos supporters with red white and blue balloons 
waited for their companions near the main road leading to the 
palace but they peacefully dispersed at sundown after most of the 
earlier protesters did not arrive 
rally leaders want president corazon aquino to reconsider her 
refusal to allow marcos to return for his mothers funeral marcos 
lives in hawaii where he fled after the february 1986 revolt which 
toppled his 20year regime 
we are going to appeal again that they allow the return of 
president marcos if only for humanitarian considerations said 
fernando diaz president of the long live the filipino movement

the soviet union acknowledged wednesday that 
something exploded at one of its chemical factories last week but 
denied us claims that it was rocket fuel used for a new 
longrange nuclear missile 
gennady i gerasimov foreign ministry spokesman said three 
people were killed and five injured in the explosion may 12 in a 
storage area of the plant at pavlograd about 500 miles southwest 
of moscow in the ukraine 
he said the chemicals involved were explosives used in civilian 
industry not fuel for the new ss24 intercontinental ballistic 
missile 
us officials in washington said tuesday the pavlograd plant is 
the sole facility for manufacturing the main rocket motors for the 
ss24 
gerasimov said in a telephone interview he did not know whether 
the plant made either the motors or fuel for them he said the 
explosion occurred at 715 am and that casualties were minimized 
because the storage area was highly automated 
a brief report by the tass news agencys englishlanguage 
service said 12 tons of quarry powder blew up its 
russianlanguage report identified the material as ammonite and 
said it exploded in a loading area of an internal warehouse at the 
pavlogradsky chemical factory 
ammonite is an explosive compound of 70 percent to 90 percent 
ammonium nitrate and saltpeter or potassium nitrate 
according to the tass report in russian the factory makes 
industrial explosive materials it identified them as rock 
ammonium alumotol and other ammonia products 
the us defense department said the explosion destroyed 
several buildings at a soviet propellant plant in pavlograd 
an american source in washington said the explosion sure tore 
that plant up but gerasimov said it did not cause major damage 
its not catastrophic he told the associated press 
one washington source said us spy satellites detected the 
explosion 
pavlograd is a city of 122000 people about 30 miles east of 
dnepropetrovsk a major industrial center gerasimov said there was 
no evacuation of the area after the explosion 
tass reported that nine hours after the explosion mayor in 
prikhodko assured residents over the local radio station there was 
no danger to health or the environment a regional health official 
repeated the message the next day the agency said 
its report which said the cause was being investigated was the 
first on the explosion by national soviet media 
the ss24 carries 10 warheads and can be launched from 
underground silos or rail cars deployment began last year 
us officials said the soviets probably would not be able to 
resume ss24 production for at least six months

an iranian official predicted on 
wednesday that the problem of 18 foreign hostages in lebanon would 
be solved if fighting between rival shiite moslem factions in south 
beirut was stopped 
acting iranian foreign minister ali mohammed besharati made the 
announcement as syria and iran disagreed on ways to end 13 days of 
combat that has killed 243 people and wounded 762 
the case of kidnapping foreigners in lebanon is part of the 
crisis which lebanon is passing through i believe that if we could 
end the state of war currently prevailing then definitely the 
other case would be solved too besharati said without further 
elaboration 
besharati has been mediating an end to the bloody dispute 
between the iranianbacked hezbollah or party of god and the 
prosyrian amal arabic for hope 
the iranian envoy made the statement on the foreign hostages in 
response to reporters questions after a meeting with acting 
lebanese prime minister salim hoss 
most of the hostages including nine americans are believed 
held by hezbollahaffiliated shiite zealots based in the 
16squaremile slums of south beirut where fighting has been 
raging since may 6 
syria on sunday massed 7500 troops and 500 tanks and armored 
vehicles on the southern western and northern edges of south 
beirut and its officers said the army was prepared to move in to 
quell the fighting 
asked whether the syrians would deploy in south beirut 
besharati said it is neither in syrias interest to deploy in 
south beirut nor does the whole population want syria to enter 
south beirut 
asked on whether his efforts would lead syria to reverse its 
decision to move into south beirut besharati said certainly it 
would lead to this 
but syrian defense minister mustafa tlass who made an 
unscheduled visit to beirut wednesday said the syrian deployment 
in south beirut was imperative 
entering the suburb is imperative the suburb is militarily 
fallen we have ringed it from all sides let all the lebanese be 
reassured tlass told reporters he did not elaborate on the 
remark 
besharati said iran was proposing the formation of a force to 
preserve security in the bombravaged slums after arranging a 
solid ceasefire 
eight ceasefire accords have collapsed since the fighting broke 
out each side blamed the other for violating them 
asked if the syrians would be represented in this force 
besharati said we and our syrian brothers would guarantee this 
force 
but the chief of syrias military intelligence in lebanon brig 
gen ghazi kenaan said besharatis efforts to arrange a political 
settlement were not succeeding 
we are giving political efforts a chance to solve the problem 
and stop the bleeding in south beirut kenaan said after a 
meeting with besharati but it seems that this effort is not 
leading to a tangible outcome 
he said syria had made the decision to storm south beirut and 
it awaits nothing but implementation 
contradicting besharatis remarks kenaan said the population 
has requested the deployment of the syrian forces to end their 
ordeal we cannot but meet the peoples pleas 
amal leader nabih berri also called for the deployment of syrian 
troops in south beirut 
amal believes that a sisterly security force regarded as a 
friend to both sides should deploy in south beirut to protect the 
people berri said after a onehour session with besharati 
syria the main power broker in lebanon is irans main arab 
ally in the war with iraq 
syria however recently has been alarmed by irans efforts to 
dispute its role in lebanon by trying to dominate the 12 million 
shiites the nations largest sect through hezbollah 
the iranian embassy said besharati would meet lebanons 
parliament speaker hussein husseini a shiite on thursday 
lebanese security sources said besharati was meeting lebanese 
officials to seek support for an iranian proposal to end the 
intershiite clashes 
one source speaking on condition of anonymity said the iranian 
envoy proposed a compromise in which syria would deploy troops only 
in the northern districts of the slums where amal still holds 
positions after being dislodged from 90 percent of the contested 
terrain

a junior high school principal says 
two girls will be given detention for two weeks for stealing a pair 
of rabbits to save them from being slaughtered in science class 
there may have been a better way to handle it to bring it to 
the attention of the administration rather than rabbitnapping 
comstock junior high school principal rich rapheal said 
we like brought them to the office if we didnt do anything 
they would be dead said wendy 15 one of the students the 
girls were not identified except as wendy and johanna 14 
rapheal said the rabbits were part of an agriculture sciences 
class in which the processing of livestock is demonstrated from 
birth to slaughter 
they are killed humanely rapheal said theyre hit on the 
head i know that doesnt sound humane with a club designed for 
that 
they could have showed us a film johanna said 
the principal said the class was warned days ahead that the 
rabbits would be killed tuesday and students who objected could 
have been excused 
still there will be changes in the class rapheal said 
theyll still have the unit on processing of meat and 
livestock but probably not kill them he said

scientists have fed a pollutant into a cloud and 
demonstrated a chemical reaction involved in acid rain a report 
says 
researchers released sulfur dioxide into a cloud that covered 
the top of a british hill and measurements showed it reacted with 
natural hydrogen peroxide according to a report in thursdays 
issue of the british journal nature 
the rate of reaction was comparable to that expected from 
laboratory experiments they wrote 
the reaction produces sulfate which reacts with atmospheric 
moisture to form sulfuric acid a constituent of acid rain 
little sulfate was detected in the experiment which was 
performed in december 1985 but significant levels appeared when 
the experiment was done in springtime when more sun was available 
to promote sulfur dioxide reactions researchers wrote 
acid rain also can include nitric acids formed from pollutants 
called nitrogen oxides it can harm vegetation and acquatic life 
and damage buildings and monuments

thats what the folks assumed at the serials directory an

subjects 
broke me up says wallace e clayton editor of the epitaph 
a nationally circulated monthly journal of western history 
ellen rice database coordinator for the serials directory 
which is based in birmingham ala said the mixup was definitely 
our fault 
someone apparently misread classification numbers and together 
with the name epitaph concluded that it was a funeral service 
directory she said 
the serials directory consisting of three volumes is 
mailed to libraries colleges and universities among other 
institutions it sells for 289 
ms rice said the error is funny but it will be corrected 
and the epitaph will be listed under publications dealing with the

us officials are bracing for the possibility 
that kremlin leader mikhail s gorbachev will offer to cut soviet 
troop strength sharply in eastern europe a development he has been 
hinting at for nearly two years 
one possibility said a us official is that gorbachev will 
use the may 29june 2 summit in moscow to suggest that the 
superpowers sit down this fall and discuss cutting their ground 
forces in europe by as much as 25 percent 
another official said gorbachev may wait until after the summit 
to make a dramatic gesture possibly announcing the unilateral 
withdrawal of 50000 to 70000 soviet troops another us official 
said tuesday as many as 100000 red army troops could be pulled 
back all three officials spoke on condition of anonymity 
gorbachev wants to cut conventional forces to free up money 
badly needed for his economic reforms robert legvold director of 
soviet studies at columbia university said in a recent study 
were he able to demobilize a large fraction of the 20 
divisions currently deployed in east germany the gains to his 
modernization program would be sizable legvold said 
condoleeza rice of stanford univerisity told a house committee 
on april 27 that the goal of current soviet strategy including 
their extraordinary flexibility in arms control is to create a 
benign foreign policy environment 
this would allow the soviets to divert resources from direct 
investment in defense and to reap the economic benefits of 
technological cooperation with the advanced capitalist states 
rice said 
western analysts have been predicting such a development since 
june 1986 when gorbachev and warsaw pact allies meeting in 
budapest called for the two sides to reduce their forces along the 
central front by about 500000 soldiers apiece by the early 1990s 
one soviet academic vitaly zhurkin subsequently proposed cuts 
of 1 million men on each side 
zhurkin and other scholars in kremlin think tanks have devoted 
considerable ink to expanding on the doctrine of reasonable 
sufficiency introduced by gorbachev at the 27th communist party 
congress in february 1986 
gorbachev zhurkin and others argue that a nation wastes money 
by building more armaments than it needs to defend itself and that 
the soviet union does not need its current vast tank army to deter 
an attack 
conventional military forces must be lowered to a level of 
reasonable sufficiency that is to a level essential for solving 
only defensive tasks two of zhurkins coleagues andrei kokoshin 
and v larionov wrote in a watershed article published in august 
1987 
to achieve this certain changes will have to occur in the way 
military professionals think legvold quoting them as writing 
soviet military officers including chief of staff marshal 
sergei akhromeyev responded with what they called defensive 
sufficiency a force adequate to deal crushing retaliatory 
blows in other words a massive counterattack against any nato 
aggression 
rice who met last month in moscow with soviet military officers 
and scholars described the internal debate in the kremlin as a 
battle royal 
us government analysts conclude that gorbachev won the debate 
and may be ready to unilaterally cut warsaw pact forces by 50000 
to 100000 troops to win support for a new round of eastwest 
negotiations on conventional forces 
according to the international institute for strategic studies 
in london the soviet union keeps 380000 ground troops at a high 
state of readiness in east germany 80000 in czechoslovakia and 
40000 in poland 
a unilateral soviet withdrawal of that scale would have little 
impact strategically one us official said but the political 
payoff could be immense in western europe where polls show great 
enthusiasm for gorbachevs foreign and domestic policies 
gorbachev appears to have come to the same conclusion reached by 
many in the west including sen sam nunn dga the chairman of 
the senate armed services committee that reducing the soviet 
advantage in conventional forces in europe would help the longterm 
kremlin goal of sharply reducing nuclear arsenals 
the warsaw pact holds a 2to1 edge along the central front 
according to pentagon estimates and the iiss in london says the 
soviet bloc has 52200 tanks compared with 22214 in nato 
the rand corp in a study of the conventional balance released 
last january concluded that because of the warsaw pact advantage 
any eastwest agreement on conventional reductions should be on a 
5to1 ratio against the soviet bloc 
earlier talks on reducing conventional forces have been stalled 
since 1973 failing even to produce agreement on the number of 
troops on each side 
reagan administration officials believe a breakthrough may be 
possible because gorbachev seems to have concluded that the warsaw 
pact must make larger cuts than nato to redress its geographic and 
numerical advantages

soviet dissident andrei sakharov 
sent a letter to mikhail s gorbachev criticizing him for his 
handling of recent ethnic unrest in the soviet union according to 
a human rights group here 
the soviet authorities response to ethnic grievances proves 
that glasnost appears to be crushed when it is most needed 
wrote the nobel prizewinning physicist 
the letter was written last month but never publicized 
according to the authoritative amsterdambased bukovsky foundation 
which distributed excerpts of the letter translated into english at 
its annual sakharov conference 
the moscowbased nuclear physicist who won the 1975 nobel peace 
prize had been invited to the conference named in his honor but 
did not attend the gathering on blank spots in soviet history 
also on wednesday expelled soviet dissident vladimir bukovsky 
for whom the foundation is named predicted that gorbachev soon 
would have to increase consumer prices and that could lead to 
unrest in soviet society 
in his letter addressed personally to the soviet leader 
sakharov criticized gorbachevs handling of recent unrest in 
azerbaijans nagornokarabakh region where ethnic armenians 
clashed with azerbaijanis in february 
in the context of perestroika the armenian population of 
karabakh raised its hopes that there may be a constitutional 
solution to the problem said sakharov who was exiled to the 
city of gorky from 198086 for criticizing his nations 
intervention in afghanistan 
glasnost or openness on selected social topics and 
perestroika or restructuring are key elements of gorbachevs 
program of social and economic reforms 
in his letter sakharov outlined how the regions armenians had 
sought reunification with the neighboring soviet republic of 
armenia 
instead of following a normal constitutional means of 
examining the application soviet authorities began to rely on 
maneuvers and persuasion directed primarily toward armenians 
said the letter which gave no details 
at the same time reports began to appear in the soviet 
press and on television in which the events were presented in a 
partial and onesided fashion and the lawful requests of the 
armenian population were described as being extremist 
thus it seems that a negative answer was preconditioned 
sakharovs letter said dozens of people have died in the 
nagornokarabakh clashes 
according to the bukovsky foundation a lobby group for soviet 
dissidents gorbachev told sakharov soon after receiving the letter 
that it would be published in the popular englishlanguage weekly 
moscow news if the dissident was willing to soften some of his 
language in the letter 
sakharov refused the foundations preface to the letter said 
adding that the document signed with deep and sincere respect 
was never published 
he also criticized the soviet leadership for refusing the return 
to the crimea of ethnic tatars of whom 238000 were sent to remote 
parts of the soviet union after josef stalin accused them of 
collaboration with nazi germany in 1944 
earlier wednesday bukovsky predicted that gorbachev would have 
to increase consumer prices by up to 75 percent across the board in 
the near future 
in the current atmosphere where people are encouraged to voice 
their protests it is inevitable that such increase of prices 
will lead to industrial unrest and strikes and demonstrations 
bukovsky said in an interview with the associated press 
next year will be a nightmare bukovsky said adding the 
revolt would be a dress rehearsal for the ultimate collapse of 
communism 
bukovsky added that civil and industrial unrest is likely to 
continue also in poland hungary and other east bloc nations with 
soviet troops unable to quell the disturbances because of the 
upheavals at home 
bukovsky who settled in britain after his 1976 expulsion from 
the soviet union spent 12 years in soviet jails and labor camps on 
charges of slandering the soviet state and antisoviet agitation 
and propaganda

the wife of palestinianrights activist 
mubarak awad launched a capitol hill lobbying effort wednesday in 
hope of persuading lawmakers to help her husband fight deportation 
from israel 
nancy nye awads wife said she has not sensed a strong support 
of congress in the matter so far 
im presenting this case to congressional members that they 
will look at this case and look at the way the government of israel 
is dealing with palestinian residents said ms nye 
she said she intends to visit congressional offices including 
those of sens howard metzenbaum dohio and john glenn dohio 
and reps michael dewine rohio and stephen solarz dny on 
wednesday and thursday before returning to israel on friday 
ms nye said us lawmakers could ask israeli prime minister 
yitzhak shamir to consider changing his decision to order awad 
deported 
awad 44 a naturalized us citizen who has a home in 
wapakoneta ohio is being held in an israeli jail pending review 
of the deportation order by israels supreme court 
a native of jerusalem awad was arrested may 5 following 
government allegations that he had done much to incite the 
fivemonth palestinian uprising in the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip 
ms nye said her husband is a moderate who believes that israel 
and palestine should exist in sidebyside states and that 
palestinians should resist the military occupation of israel 
through nonviolent methods 
she said the courts decision expected shortly after it hears 
the case next monday will determine whether christian and moslem 
residents of jerusalem can have their residency rights lifted and 
be asked to leave their homeland 
ms nye released copies of a letter she received from her 
husband last sunday in the letter awad said he is willing to 
accept the state of israel and that palestinians have been using 
civil disobedience and nonviolent action to deliver a message to 
the israelis and the world 
let not this chance be gone awad wrote dont force us 
again to kill 
ms nye said she believes awad meant that many palestinians have 
had to discipline themselves in using nonviolent means to send the 
message that they are tired of living under military occupation 
but he also understands that a long struggle that seems to be 
falling on deaf ears will produce a frustration she said and 
i think he fears that that frustration will lead to violence

sikh radicals surrendered after a 10day 
siege and emerged wednesday from their revered golden temple 
symbol of the dream of an independent nation that propels their 
campaign of blood and terror 
fortyfive men and a woman emerged hands in the air or clasped 
on their heads about 2800 police commandos and paramilitary 
troops surrounded the sacred compound which has walls 20 feet high 
and covers the equivalent of five city blocks 
no terrorist is inside the complex said kps gill police 
chief of punjab state all of them have come out 
the militants crossed an 8footwide white marble walkway that 
provides the only access to the 400yearold shrine which sits in 
a vast pool where pilgrims bathe in peaceful times the surrender 
took 45 minutes 
gill said one radical tried to flee and was shot dead and three 
committed suicide by swallowing cyanide capsules another committed 
suicide by the same method sunday 
officials say 42 people most of them militant sikhs were 
killed during the siege bringing the death toll to 46 with the 
suicides 
the golden temple sikhisms holiest site has been the center 
and symbol of sikh militancy since the separatists began their 
terrorist war in 1982 
thousands of people have been killed and wednesdays surrender 
does not end their struggle for a sikh nation in this rich northern 
agricultural state it would be called khalistan or land of the 
pure 
elsewhere in punjab the only indian state in which sikhs are a 
majority sikh gunmen killed at least 40 people tuesday and 
wednesday the victims included 31 itinerant hindu laborers who 
were attacked in their tents late tuesday night near a canal they 
were building near majjat a village 120 miles southeast of 
amritsar 
militants say sikhs need a separate homeland to preserve their 
faith and avoid discrimination by hindus 
they have killed at least 1063 people in punjab so far this 
year including entire families the death toll from their 
terrorism in all of 1987 was 1032 
sikhism was founded 500 years ago as an alternative to hinduism 
and islam only 2 percent of indias 800 million people are sikhs 
and 82 percent are hindus 
commandos searched everyone who emerged from the golddomed 
temple wednesday even to the point of removing turbans and 
unwrapping the yards of fabric that form the traditional headgear 
of devout male sikhs 
prisoners were taken to a tin shed where red cross workers gave 
them food and water 
five bodies were found inside the complex one identified as 
that of jagir singh spokesman for the panthic committee umbrella 
group for a dozen separatist groups 
it was partially burned but there was no word on the cause of 
death another body of a woman was found in the sacred pool 
during the ceasefire and subsequent surrender crowds gathered 
300 yards from the temple compound that was as close as they could 
get to the shrine whose immediately vicinity has been sealed off 
since the siege began may 9 in amritsar a city of 800000 people 
this is a day of great relief punjab governor sidharth 
shankar ray said wednesday night but added it is neither 
victory nor defeat 
he urged sikh militants throughout punjab to turn themselves in 
at the nearest police stations and said the temple would be 
restored to its religious function as soon as possible 
government forces had been careful to avoid storming the temple 
prime minister indira gandhi ordered an army assault against 
sikh gunmen in the complex in 1984 in which more than 1200 people 
were killed less than five months later on oct 31 two of her 
sikh bodyguards assassinated mrs gandhi 
her son and successor prime minister rajiv gandhi said 
wednesday night no one should be allowed to carry arms in the 
golden temple 
in his first public statement after the siege ended he said in 
new delhi he believes most sikhs in india supported it 
sikh militants usually complain of discrimination in general 
terms but one specific complaint is the allegation that gandhis 
government has tried to weaken punjabs economy by diverting river 
water needed for its agriculture to other states 
because of the terror campaign security officials outside 
punjab scrutinize sikhs more closely at checkpoints and during 
times of crisis since devout sikhs wear turbans moustaches and 
untrimmed beards they are instantly distinguishable

the boston red sox have refused to cover a 
billboard advertising cigarettes during a charity game to raise 
money to fight childrens cancer despite complaints by an 
antismoking group 
the bostonbased group against smoking pollution or gasp asked 
the ballclub to cover a billboard in center field promoting 
marlboro cigarettes during an exhibition game to be played thursday 
between the red sox and cincinnati reds to benefit cancer research 
red sox management said the billboard which has an illustration 
of a cowboy could not be covered because of a longterm contract 
the team has with the philip morris tobacco company 
the red sox have entered into a contract that is legally 
binding team counsel john donovan said wednesday i intend to 
honor my contracts 
gasp executive director jerry maldavir said he believes the red 
sox are sending mixed messages to children by displaying the 
billboard 
since thursday nights game is for children who have cancer 
the red sox should do something to dispel the connection between 
smoking and baseball he said 
donovan refused to comment on the image projected by the 
cigarette ad but said the team has raised millions of dollars for 
the local childrens cancer group known as the jimmy fund in the 
past and will continue to support the charity 
steven weiss a spokesman for philip morris said he had no 
immediate comment on the dispute 
mike andrews executive director of fund raising for the jimmy 
fund said although he does not think attacking the red sox is 
fair he could not fault the antismoking group for trying gasp 
has been trying for six years to get the ballclub to drop the 
tobacco advertisements 
if anything i think all tobacco advertising smoking or 
smokeless should be banned as should smoking itself tobacco is a 
drug andrews said 
kids idolize and emulate sports figures maldavir said 
when they see the billboard on television or at the ballpark 
they think baseball and smoking go hand in hand 
the red sox project this attractiveness that says wear what 
i wear smoke what i smoke 
in light of the us surgeon generals recent report that 
concludes nicotine found in tobacco is as addictive as drugs 
maldavir said his groups request is even more urgent 
in 1971 advertising of tobacco products was banned on 
television but every time the tv cameras go across the scoreboard 
there it is maldavir said

officials have lifted restrictions on the sale of 
american and west european newspapers and magazines and they will 
be sold in ordinary press kiosks in the future the weekly moscow 
news reported wednesday 
viktor pukalov head of the soyuzpechat agency that distributes 
soviet and foreign periodicals told moscow news the first step 
toward extending the sales of western newspapers and magazines was 
the decision to open access to these publications to the general 
public 
the newspaper did not make clear when the publications would 
appear 
the article specifically mentioned the times of london the 
international herald tribune newsweek and the economist as 
examples of western publications that will be available in soviet 
kiosks 
pukalov acknowledged that another barrier to broader circulation 
the nonconvertible ruble has not been surmounted 
soviet hardcurrency reserves are limited and therefore the 
government spends its dollars pounds and other convertible funds 
on priority items like grain and hightechnology equipment for 
boosting factory output 
i think that our western partners will be interested in an 
exchange of publications pukalov told the newspaper interest 
in our press is growing along with the interest in our country for 
the first time the single number of export copies of soviet 
newspapers and magazines reached 125 million copies 
pukalov said 160000 issues of publications from 46 foreign 
countries reach moscow each day but indicated that most go to 
hotels frequented by foreigners or to press and foreign trade 
offices that need to know what is carried in those publications 
western publications are more expensive than soviet newspapers 
which usually sell for 3 to 5 kopeks 5 to 8 cents and the price 
to soviet customers would have to be even higher to recover the 
cost and transport the newspaper said

the senate was still trying to work its way 
out of a legislative snarl wednesday which has blocked final action 
on a pentagon budget bill while the house voted overwhelming 
passage of a military construction measure 
were trying to work out some type of agreement but we dont 
have one yet i dont know when it will be done said senate 
majority leader robert byrd dwva 
the dispute involves an amendment that would allow drug dealers 
convicted of killing people to be sentenced to death 
sen alfonse damato rny sponsor of the amendment has 
refused to withdraw the proposal and opponents have threatened a 
filibuster to block a final vote on the provision 
damato has offered to drop the amendment if democratic leaders 
promise that it will come before the chamber later for a separate 
vote but opponents have not dropped filibuster threats 
i am not willing to let this go until we can be assured of a 
vote damato said wednesday afternoon 
the amendment is the only unresolved issue in the huge pentagon 
budget bill sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services 
committee has pushed for final action by the democraticcontrolled 
chamber 
approval by the senate would send the bill to a conference 
committee to be reconciled with the separate pentagon spending 
measure passed a week ago by the house 
both bills authorize defense spending of 2995 billion in the 
fiscal year beginning oct 1 but contain a number of differences 
over issues such as arms control the star wars budget and 
ordering the military into the fight against drugs 
meanwhile the house voted 38226 passage of a bill 
appropriating 9 billion for a variety of military construction 
programs for the next fiscal year the senate has yet to act on its 
version of the same measure 
the bill is different from the authorization legislation which 
allows the pentagon to go ahead and sign contracts appropriation 
bills are considered later 
the house measure includes 775 million for the first 
construction of hangars at whiteman air force base in missouri for 
the stealth bomber 
the plane known formally as the b2 is designed to evade 
soviet radar the air force plans to begin deploying it early in 
the next decade the first stealth bombers will be based at 
whiteman

republican sen lowell weicker said 
wednesday that attorney general edwin meese iii is a son of a 
bitch that he doesnt like but stopped short of saying meese 
should resign 
connecticuts other senator democrat christopher dodd said 
meese should step down in taking that position dodd said he had 
voted against meeses confirmation in the first place and merely 
was being consistent 
the two lawmakers were guests of president reagan on air force 
one en route to new london conn where reagan delivered the 
commencement address at the us coast guard academy 
weicker and dodd made their comments separately talking with 
reporters in the rear cabin of the presidential jet about reagans 
longtime friend while the president was in his cabin at the front 
of the aircraft a reporter reminded weicker that his comments were 
on the record 
weicker a frequent critic of administration policies who is 
seeking a fourth term in office this fall expressed surprise that 
he had been invited aboard air force one 
meese has been been the target of a criminal investigation by 
independent counsel james mckay of possible conflict of interest 
there have been repeated calls for meeses resignation when a 
reporter asked weicker if meese should step down he said ive 
been battling the son of a bitch ever since he became attorney 
general i dont like him 
however weicker said i want to see the report of the special 
prosecutor mckay before saying whether meese should leave 
later as reagan toured a coast guard cutter in new london 
television reporters tried to get weicker to repeat his assessment 
of meese on camera he said merely that he wanted to see the 
special prosecutors report 
when pressed on the issue by abctv correspondent sam donaldson 
weicker playfully thrust his hand behind the cameras and raised his 
middle finger in the reporters face 
reagan often invites members of congress to accompany him on 
trips to their states and districts as a matter of presidential 
courtesy 
reagan eating lunch with members of the cutters crew was 
asked by a reporter about conservatives unhappiness over meeses 
firing of justice department spokesman terry eastland 
i think some will keep on trying to make a fuss over him 
meese reagan replied so far theyre all empty charges

prosecutors launched an 
investigation wednesday into allegations the late head of west 
germanys jewish community embezzled millions of dollars of 
government money earmarked for holocaust survivors 
prosecutors also said others may have been involved in the 
embezzling scheme apparently led by werner nachmann who headed the 
central jewish council for 23 years until his death in january 
jewish leaders said they would launch their own inquiry 
we need a wideranging explanation we must get to the bottom 
of this a jewish leader in frankfurt ignatz bubis told hesse 
state radio 
we will use all legal means at our disposal to take action 
against everyone who took part in this said michael fuerst a 
hanover jewish leader 
manfred roething a spokesman for the karlsruhe prosecutors 
office said investigators would seek to determine whether other 
parties may be liable for prosecution as accessories 
in bonn the allegations were discussed at the regular wednesday 
meeting of the cabinet said government spokesman friedhelm ost 
heinz galinski nachmanns successor as head of the jewish 
community said he would meet with a kohl aide wolfgang schaeuble 
on friday to discuss the case 
eberhard braun a courtappointed investigator who has been 
examining nachmanns financial records told the associated press 
that he had found unexplained income of 13 million in nachmanns 
company records 
peter paepcke the nachmann family attorney said he believes 
nachmann may have embezzled up to 15 million and used it to 
bolster his failing wholesale textile and raw materials company 
i had hoped in going through the records to find some cause 
for why this the embezzlement happened even a political cause 
but i couldnt find anything like that he said in an interview 
paepcke said he filed for bankruptcy march 30 for nachmanns 
heirs and his karlsruhebased company he did not provide further 
details about a diversion of funds 
nachmann president of the jewish council from 1965 until his 
death at age 62 was in charge of disbursing government funds to 
holocaust survivors around the world 
about 236 million was allocated by the government in 1980 for 
holocaust survivors who had not previously made reparations claims 
on tuesday galinski said the jewish council had asked a civil 
court to freeze the assets of nachmanns estate 
he said nachmann appears to have embezzled about 6 million but 
said other reported figures were speculation 
galinski said he first heard of the allegations april 10 but he 
declined to give further details 
nachmann had been active in trying to help heal wounds in west 
germany left by the holocaust in which about 6 million jews were 
killed during nazi rule 
nachmanns family fled nazi germany to france in 1938 he 
returned to karlsruhe in 1945 and began working toward 
reestablishing jewish communities in the country 
about 530000 jews lived in germany when the nazis took power in 
1933 west germany has about 30000 jewish residents today

the county sheriffs association 
overwhelmingly ratified a new contract that would ban the hiring of 
smokers 
the provision does not apply to smokers already employed by the 
department said ron komers director of the ventura county 
personnel department 
the 550member association made up of sheriffs deputies 
sergeants and investigators voted by a 91 ratio last week in 
favor of the twoyear contract the county board of supervisors is 
expected to give its final approval next week 
under the plan new employees would be required to sign an 
agreement stating they will not smoke he said violators could be 
fired 
no law enforcement agency in california and only a few across 
the nation have such a policy officials said 
county spokeswoman lucy crockett said the contract was modeled 
on one instituted by alexandria va police 11 years ago that 
policy however was rescinded in 1986 and replaced with one that 
allows smoking in designated areas because the department had 
trouble with enforcement she said 
the measure is intended to reduce healthcare and pension costs 
which statistics show can range up to 5000 more per year for a 
smoker than for a nonsmoker komers said

jesse jackson met wednesday with jewish 
leaders in what he described as a step toward healing the 
wounds and the beginning of indepth dialogue with jewish critics 
of his democratic presidential candidacy 
a few in the group endorsed him 
jackson said after the 90minute private meeting with a dozen 
los angeles area rabbis and about 20 other jewish leaders that he 
would have a similar meeting in new york next month after 
californias june 7 presidential primary 
his campaign has been troubled by opposition from jewish voters 
due in part to his 1979 meeting with palestine liberation 
organization leader yasser arafat his reference in 1984 to new 
york as hymietown and his past relationship to louis farrakhan 
who has made antijewish statements 
while about a dozen demonstrators outside jacksons hollywood 
hotel chanted lose jesse lose jew hater and jesse get 
out of town jackson and about half of the participants in the 
closed session praised each other at a joint news conference 
jackson described the session as a step toward healing the 
wounds adding that we do live in one global community we 
walk together 
rabbi allen freehling said that the litany of complaints in 
the jewish community with jesse jackson has been articulated and 
that there was a reconciliation 
we are as jews and blacks united in one respect we have a 
common commitment to justice said rabbi leonard beerman one of 
the few participants in the session to say he was endorsing jackson 
asked by reporters why he didnt have a similar meeting while 
campaigning in new york last month jackson cited verbal attacks 
against him by edward koch new york citys jewish mayor and said 
here you have a climate that is more conducive to healing his 
differences with jewish voters we thought this was the right 
place to start 
koch had said during the new york primary campaign that jewish 
voters concerned about the fate of israel would have to be crazy to 
vote for jackson 
jackson said on wednesday i met with arafat so did the pope 
we took him not arms we took to him an appeal for reason for 
justice 
on another subject jackson said he would not let death threats 
deter his campaign 
asked if he was changing anything because of the arrests tuesday 
of a st louis couple accused of conspiring to harm or kill him 
jackson replied no we are not we know that those who will do 
peace must face the hostility of those who are bound to fear 
we will not surrender to the dreambusters the secret service 
will handle the dreambusters he said praising the federal 
agents protecting him and other presidential candidates 
security spokesmen declined comment on whether jacksons 
security had been increased but there were no signs of any 
significant change in their procedures 
on politics jackson said he was not discouraged by polls 
indicating he is trailing massachusetts gov michael dukakis by 
more than 30 percentage points in california 
all my life has been an uphill battle we will not 
surrender jackson said 
earlier jackson had said that the results of the oregon 
primary where dukakis defeated him handily would still give his 
campaign a boost in california because his oregon showing was 
better than 1984 
we look forward to california new jersey new mexico and 
montana as our base of support continues to expand im very 
encouraged jackson said

democratic presidential frontrunner michael 
dukakis insisted wednesday that he has not begun looking for a 
running mate but said he hoped to choose one before the democratic 
national convention in july 
nobody is heading my search for a running mate dukakis 
said the search for a running mate will not begin until the 8th 
of june the day after the final primaries 
the washington post reported wednesday that dukakis campaign 
chairman paul brountas was heading the search 
i havent made that decision dukakis told a statehouse news 
conference but it will be a thoughtful and i hope successful 
search 
several dukakis aides speaking privately said they were aware 
of no formal search for a running mate but that they expected 
brountas a law school classmate and close friend of the governor 
to head the effort 
with prospects of a convention battle with jackson dukakis was 
asked if he hoped to choose a running mate before then 
most nominees do he said if im the nominee i would hope 
that decision will be made before the convention sure or at least 
the recommendations 
the massachusetts governor also brushed off the latest challenge 
of delegate selection rules from rival jesse jackson whose 
campaign on wednesday said it sent dukakis a letter indicating 
jackson planned a convention challenge to delegate rules 
jackson has been complaining recently that dukakis has unfairly 
been getting the support of the majority of super delegates 
elected officials and party leaders who automatically are 
convention delegates 
i dont think we are going to have a fight with mr jackson 
he said 
i think jesse has a perfect right to voice criticism of 
whatever he chooses to criticize he said before repeating his 
position that jackson knew the delegate selection rules when he 
entered the race 
dukakis was leaving massachusetts wednesday night for 
appearances in new york and new jersey he was to attend several 
events thursday morning in new jersey before heading to california 
for several days of campaigning there california and new jersey 
hold primaries june 7 
dukakis held the news conference to announce an executive order 
expanding state use of recycled products and banning the state from 
purchasing nonrecyclable polystyrene products which have been 
linked to damaging the ozone layer

a federal judge has turned down a request for 
an expedited hearing by a wildlife group clearing the way for the 
toledo zoo to begin exhibiting two giant pandas from china 
officials said wednesday 
kenneth cook press director of the world wildlife fund said he 
had hoped a hearing could be held in us district court this week 
on the groups motion to bar the exhibit which is scheduled to 
open next tuesday 
but cook said judge norma johnson could not schedule a hearing 
that soon and asked the parties to file additional briefs in the 
case 
i think it happens when the court gets jammed said cook 
were disappointed were stuck 
but he said the wildlife fund intends to continue its fight and 
plans to file its brief on friday he said he presumes a hearing 
will be set after the reply briefs are filed 
ellen efros lawyer for the zoo said rules require that a reply 
brief be filed within five working days of the wildlife funds 
filing she said the judges decision clears the way for the 
exhibit to open 
last week judge johnson refused to grant a temporary restraining 
order sought by the group to prevent the pandas from being shipped 
to toledo from shanghai 
the pandas are scheduled to spend at least 100 days at the zoo 
which has spent nearly 3 million preparing for their visit 
in their suit against the us fish and wildlife service the 
wildlife fund argued that exhibition of the pandas violates an 
international convention that prohibits trafficking in endangered 
species for commercial purposes 
the group says the exhibition would increase the demand for such 
transactions from other zoos and hurt the effort to breed pandas

documentaries like chungs life in the fat lane and maria 
shrivers women in prison

in this border town and it will keep developing and growing even 
stronger his comments were reported by the soviet news agency 
tass 
nikolai novikov 21 was the first soviet soldier to cross the 
bridge over the river amudarya that forms the border between 
afghanistan and soviet uzbekistan he was riding on a flowerdecked 
armored personnel carrier 
behind him followed 228 vehicles and about 1300 soldiers of his 
motor rifle unit 
the convoy was the first significant withdrawal of soviet forces 
under a unsponsored peace accord that calls for the kremlin to 
remove all of its estimated 115000 soldiers within nine months 
the kremlin sent soldiers over the border into afghanistan in 
december 1979 they replaced one prosoviet government with another 
and stayed to help fight usbacked moslem insurgents 
tass said col yuri starov unit commander told a rally our 
officers and men have done all they could for peace on afghan 
soil 
our best comrades have not laid down their lives there in 
vain he said afghanistan remains free and independent 
rafie said that as a result of soviet aid children are going 
to school peasants are cultivating land and workers are operating 
their lathes 
you have helped us to create a battleworthy peoples army 
which can independently fulfill any assignment to protect the 
fatherland he said 
reporters flown to termez saw troops cross the bridge of 
friendship from the afghan village of khairaton 
information about the soviet withdrawal has been relayed from 
kabul by a reuters news agency pool report 
the associated press was denied permission to travel to 
afghanistan for the pullout a soviet foreign ministry official 
said recently the exclusion was the result of inappropriate 
questions asked during a previous visit by ap 
tass said a band played a march as the convoy crossed the river 
and motorists honked their car horns the military vehicles honked 
their horns in reply 
most of the soviet troops in the initial withdrawal convoy had 
left their base in jalalabad near the border with pakistan early 
sunday 
the most dangerous stretches of the threeday journey of the 
convoy from kabul to termez had been expected to be a gorge north 
of the capital and the salang tunnel in the hindu kush mountains 
overrun with rebels 
but col grigory bondarev a senior officer with the convoy 
said there were no major incidents on the journey from jalalabad 
west to the capital kabul and north to the soviet border 
all who left jalalabad arrived safe and healthy he said 
i can tell you officially that there was no shooting from 
jalalabad to kabul and from kabul to khairaton 
but soviet tv on tuesday night showed a correspondent with the 
convoy while rifle fire crackled around him the reporter did not 
give his location 
the geneva accord was signed last month by pakistan and 
afghanistan with the soviet union and united states as guarantors 
the fundamentalist moslem guerrillas did not participate in the 
negotiations or sign the pact

with him and his current wife lisa at their malibu calif home 
its a great pleasure for me that all of them have come back 
and are living with me even the 26yearold kristofferson said 
randolph the new york yankee second baseman who spends half the 
baseball season on the road says he has to work at keeping 
communication lines open with his four children 
we have conferences randolph said we dim the lights and 
just talk youd be amazed at the offthewall stuff they can say 
whatever they want 
he started the family rap sessions about four years ago to try 
to bring the family together now if they go more than a week 
without a chat one of the kids will say its time for a 
conference dad randolph said 
another honoree nbc white house correspondent chris wallace 
who also travels often as part of his job said the notion of 
quality time is a myth

france will reestablish diplomatic relations with 
iran fulfilling a deal that led to this months release of three 
french hostages in lebanon premier michel rocard announced 
wednesday 
france gave its word it will be kept rocard told reporters 
after the weekly cabinet meeting 
the last three french hostages held by proiranian moslem 
shiites in lebanon were freed four days before the may 8 
presidential election in which premier jacques chirac a 
conservative lost to socialist president francois mitterrand 
chirac resigned after his defeat and mitterrand appointed 
rocard also a socialist as premier 
rocard said that the new government found no written record of 
the deal to free diplomats marcel carton and marcel fontaine and 
journalist jeanpaul kauffmann 
media reports speculated that france had made a deal with iran 
as a condition for the release including the payment of a ransom 
chirac had said irans intervention on behalf of the captive 
frenchmen would make possible a return to normal diplomatic 
relations 
iran has long said it had influence over groups holding western 
hostages but told france that improved relations were needed for 
the hostages to benefit 
but chiracs statement about reestablishing ties has been the 
only public reference to any possible exchange in return for the 
hostages 
the hostages the last frenchmen held by proiranians were 
freed following lengthy negotiations headed by theninterior 
minister charles pasqua pasqua denied any ransom was paid 
speculation centers on frances repayment to iran of a 1 
billion loan for the financing of a nuclear concern eurodif 
rocard said the return to normal relations would create a 
better climate for commercial negotiations with iran such as 
the final settlement of the eurodif debt 
my government and the president do not intend to pass judgment 
on the conditions under which these negotiations took place 
rocard said making an apparent reference to the timing of the 
releases largely construed here as an electoral ploy 
the two countries broke diplomatic ties july 17 in events 
leading up to the last hostage release iranian embassy officials 
in paris refused to let french authorities question walid gordji 
an embassy translator suspected of involvement with terrorism 
police surrounded the embassy 
in turn iranian troops sealed off the french embassy in tehran 
france said iran had effectively severed relations 
gordji was allowed to leave france two days after the return of 
two french in november 
mitterrand took personal responsibility for the move to 
reestablish ties announcing the start of the process at the 
cabinet meeting the first regular one since his reelection 
ten french hostages were freed from lebanon in the two years 
that chiracs government was in power one hostage middle east 
researcher michel seurat died in capitivity 
eighteen foreigners nine of them americans were kidnapped in 
lebanon the longest held is terry anderson chief middle east

michael cavallo gave its first annual awards to a fired shipyard 
inspector a former census bureau worker and an exveterans 
administration employee 
the awards presented by cavallo at a news conference came on 
the eve of a senate committee vote on a bill that would protect 
government employees who disclose abuses the bill would restrict 
the office of the special counsel from acting against 
whistleblowers who complain that the agency often ends up 
investigating them when they file complaints 
the governmental affairs committee is to take up the bill which 
would also give additional judicial protection to whistelblowers 
on thursday 
they probably thought i was a nitpicker and a busybody but i 
didnt care said leon bard 34 who was fired in 1986 as a 
quality inspector at bath iron works in bath maine after he 
disclosed that uninspected steel was being used in the construction 
of ticonderogaclass navy cruisers 
the company has denied that it used uninspected materials in its 
shipbuilding bard who is suing to get his job back said he now 
does seasonal excavation work and odd jobs in bath 
john barter 39 said he was fired as security chief at the 
cincinnati veterans administration medical center for reporting 
alleged brutality to patients by a va police chief 
i hope my suffering will lead to real free speech rights for 
other employees said barter who works parttime for a halfway 
house in cincinnati but said he has been unable to find a fulltime 
job since he was fired 
the other award winner billie pirner garde 35 got a law 
degree after she was fired for speaking out eight years ago against 
corruption and sexual harassment in the muskogee okla district 
office of the census bureau now she works in appleton wis with 
the government accountability project defending whistleblowers in 
the nuclear industry

award and 3000 to longtime whistleblower a ernest fitzgerald 
61 who has become wellknown for disclosing corruption and 
mismanagement in the defense department where he has worked for 23 
years 
fitzgerald praised cavallo for setting up the awards saying 
i just hope you dont run out of money because the other side 
has lots more 
cavallo 35 who said he contributed 300000 to set up the 
foundation last year described the award as a reward for people 
who risk their jobs and risk having their lives turned upside 
down for doing the right thing 
he said the awardees were chosen by a panel from among 25 people 
nominated by public interest groups investigative reporters and

although the lives of arthur vinal jr and 
edward wanton are separated by nearly three centuries their names 
both appear on a lawsuit seeking to stop the construction of four 
houses 
one of wantons descendants has gone to to court seeking to 
block vinals proposed building project until a more thorough 
search is made for a 17thcentury burial ground believed to contain 
the remains of wanton and other early quaker colonists 
a hearing is scheduled next week in plymouth county superior 
court on sally sanfords request for an injunction 
sanford a new york musician and wantons 
greatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgreatgranddaughter obtained a 
temporary restraining order against the development tuesday 
historical burial grounds are protected by state law 
but vinal himself a descendant of 17th century settlers said 
an extensive search was made and two old headstones were discovered 
outside the site proposed for four singlefamily homes 
ive read a lot of stories about the north river and knew 
about the burial ground thats why we looked around before we made 
any plans said vinal 
im convinced we will not be disturbing any burial site with 
the four homes he said 
the town planning board last june approved construction of four 
houses on 16 of the 80 acres owned by vinal for about 20 years 
weve done what is expected of a developer said vinals 
attorney peter puciloski the suit is simply without merit 
sanford said wanton fled the massachusetts bay colony in the 
mid1600s and settled on the north river where he worked as a 
teacher village leader and shipwright 
he set aside land near his house where he and other quakers were 
buried quakers are a christian sect founded in england about 1650 
based on a rejection of violence 
sanford maintains the full 16 acres should be surveyed more 
carefully her suit says norwell planners did not consider 
affidavits from longtime residents who said they had knowledge of 
the location of the burial site 
sanford said she became interested in wanton nine years ago when 
researching family roots

pope john paul iis nomination of a conservative 
bishop has touched off a controversy that bares deep discontent 
among swiss roman catholics over what critics charge is a growing 
assertion of vatican dominance wolfgang haas 40 is to be 
consecrated sunday as auxiliary bishop in switzerlands 
secondlargest diocese chur the title of coadjutor bestowed on 
him by the pontiff gives the prelate the automatic right to succeed 
bishop johannes vonderach 72 as head of the chur diocese 
the nomination of haas said to hold strongly conservative views 
of the churchs role in society has drawn wide criticism in the 
lay and religious press of switzerland 
the appointment is also being challenged as incompatible with a 
special privilege the vatican granted in 1948 to churs cathedral 
chapter of 24 leading priests who have the right to elect their 
bishop from among three candidates named by the pope 
catholics feel deeply hurt in their sense of justice said 
an editorial this week in orientierung a zurich roman catholic 
periodical one has the impression that even in rome people and 
institutions who are thoroughly willing to respect the cultural and 
political peculiarities of a country were not consulted 
switzerland is a cradle of protestantism and the native land of 
the rev hans kueng a critic of the papacy 
reformminded catholics are also concerned that haas 
conservatism will reduce the role of the many lay people who have 
become active in parishes since the 1960s 
haas 40 is said to have little sympathy for the increasingly 
important role of women in the church in switzerland 
he has already refused to say mass in the chur cathedral 
because a woman was supposed to deliver the homily said 
theologian martha brun 
last week a petition signed by 267 of the chur dioceses 550 
priests was handed to the representative of the pope in the capital 
of bern it demanded that haas renounce his appointment pending 
clarification of the special rights of succession in the chur 
diocese 
the problem is that a vested right was bypassed said the 
rev guido kolb a member of the cathedral chapter who delivered 
the petition to the capital but the tendency in rome is 
centralist again ignoring the privileges of thelocal churches 
kolb said the nonsigners included those who felt the petition 
was too conciliatory and others who favor dropping the matter 
haas has yet to react to the criticism he has merely said he 
cannot and will not renounce his right of succession 
but his consecration is not likely to end the debate 
theology students have staged protest demonstrations in chur 
where 50 students mounted a 10hour vigil in front of the 
cathedral and in the city of fribourg which has switzerlands 
largest roman catholic university in fribourg a funeral cortege 
accompanied a coffin marked second vatican council a 
reference to the program of reforms instituted in the 1960s to 
modernize the church

nearly half the 290 doctors suspended by 
tampa general hospital for falling behind in paperwork rushed to 
complete patient records wednesday to win reinstatement a 
spokeswoman said 
the list of suspensions which affected admitting privileges 
only stood at 159 doctors by midday wednesday a day after it was 
posted at the hospital said cindy tanner spokeswoman at the 
hospital 
ms tanner said that since the hospitals large records section 
is open aroundtheclock there has been no crush from doctors 
scrambling to fill out forms 
it has been a smooth process she said 
of the 331 doctors warned in notices mailed sunday 41 complied 
before tuesday the 290 suspensions represented about onethird of 
the staff 
its no big deal said tom clark executive director of the 
hillsborough county medical association hospitals all over the 
country do it 
clark said he hadnt received many complaints from doctors but 
he said tampa general let too many doctors fall behind with too 
many records causing a budget shortfall 
hospital president newell france noted that patients and 
insurance companies cant be billed and medicare and medicaid wont 
pay until records are completed 
bills worth 55 million for patients discharged more than a 
month ago have been held up because of the problem france said 
causing a definite impact on cash flow 
in addition france said the joint commission on accreditation 
cited tampa general in its january survey for allowing charts to 
fall behind it gave the hospital until june to get them in order 
dr edward spoto hospital chief of staff said the number of 
suspensions appeared to be extrordinary because the hospital 
and medical staff are strictly enforcing staff rules and 
regulations and a new physicianmedical records information and 
notification system has been installed 
the system allows more frequent notification to physicians about 
incomplete charts and records the old system notified them once a 
month and gave the physicians 15 days to complete their charts he 
said 
in an emezgency emergency room physicians can admit a patient 
even if the persons doctor is suspended nonemergency admissions 
must wait until the physician is reinstated

the federal communications commission on 
wednesday approved rules that are likely to reduce how often tv 
viewers will see reruns of shows like the brady bunch and i 
love lucy 
the fcc voting 30 to adopt the rules said local tv stations 
will be able to negotiate exclusive contracts for syndicated 
programs cable tv systems that broadcast the same programs in a 
local stations viewing area will have to black out the shows or 
substitute other programs 
broadcasters welcomed the rules but the cable industry 
predicted an outcry from angry viewers and said it will challenge 
the rules in court some critics say the rules could spell the end 
of some socalled superstations whose local signals are carried by 
cable systems in other parts of the country 
fcc chairman dennis r patrick said he expects the rules will 
end the reign of reruns on tv and by giving broadcasters a 
measure of protection will heighten the value of the programs to 
advertisers more ad revenue in turn will foster production of 
new programs he said 
the big winners today are consumers they will benefit by a 
smooth transition to a fairer and more competitive market structure 
which promises richer and more diverse programming patrick said 
it is unlikely cable systems will have to resort to blackouts to 
comply with the rules patrick said because of a oneyear 
transition period a variety of exceptions that will be allowed and 
the amount of substitute programming that is availble 
blackouts will only occur if cable operators seek to cause 
turmoil for shortterm political advantage which i cannot believe 
they will do he said 
broadcasters have been pushing the fcc to reimpose exclusivity 
rules and were happy with the final product but the national cable 
television association said the action pulled the plug on the 
favorite tv programs of millions of people 
ncta president james mooney predicted that people whose 
favorite programs disappear will be angered and bewildered and 
the costs of syndicated programming will go up 
the rules are similar to ones the fcc dropped in 1980 since 
then cable systems have been able to carry the signals of 
outoftown stations such as wtbs in atlanta wwor in the new york 
area and wgn in chicago which have become known as superstations 
even when those stations transmit programs whose rights were bought 
by a local tv station 
ted turner chairman of turner broadcasting inc which owns 
wtbs said in a statement the new rules do not give the cable 
industry a realistic chance to avoid massive blackouts 
turner held out the possibility of a court appeal but said that 
decision would be made after the fcc issues its written rules 
jeff treeman senior vice president of united video the tulsa 
oklabased cable carrier that distributes superstation signals 
including wgn said cable systems in some large markets where 
independents can afford to buy exclusive rights to programming may 
have to black out or substitute shows for as much as 40 percent of 
a superstations programming 
thats enough for the cable operator to drop the signal he 
said 
under the new syndicated programming exclusivity rules tv 
stations will be able to negotiate for exclusive rights to a 
syndicated program and will be able to force a cable system to 
honor that contract the rules also allow broadcasters to negotiate 
rights with cable systems 
superstations also will be able to buy exclusive rights for 
syndicated shows on a nationwide basis under the rules 
patrick said the new rules wont go into effect for one year to 
give cable systems time to prepare 
the rules wont apply to cable systems with fewer than 1000 
subscribers about half of all cable systems fall into this 
category though they serve only about 5 percent of the nations 45 
million cable subscribers the fcc said 
you will see more diversity in programs said edward o 
fritts president of the national association of broadcasters 
though he added that rules will likely drive up the cost of 
syndicated programming

republican george bush declared wednesday he 
would not bargain with drug dealers as president but he still 
refused to give his views on reports of a pleabargain deal with 
panamanian gen manuel noriega 
in a day devoted to tough talk on drugs the vice president 
visited a rock house where the potent cocaine derivative crack 
was sold and used then said in a speech at the los angeles policy 
academy that he would put his vice president in charge of a 
cabinetlevel council of war against illegal drugs 
drug dealers are domestic terrorists killing kids and cops 
and they should be treated as such bush said i wont bargain 
with terrorists and i wont bargain with drug dealers either 
whether they are on us or foreign soil 
bush spokesman peter teeley was asked if bush meant that 
statement to apply to noriega he said bush responded that his 
statement referred to the way i would deal with drug dealers as 
president 
the reagan administration has been taking part in negotiations 
designed to persuade noreiga to step down from power published 
reports have said that the dropping of us drug charges against 
noriega would be part of the deal 
at an earlier appearance wednesday bush was asked again about 
such a deal with noriega he refused comment as he has each time he 
has been asked 
as for his proposal that his vice president be in charge of a 
bush administration antidrug effort he said ive been involved 
as vice president as part of the federal effort against drugs but 
ive concluded thats not enough if im elected i will put my 
vice president in charge of every aspect of federal drug policy 
together we can coordinate an attack on the drug trade that 
will be nothing less than a modern dday we have not spent the 
last 200 years defending our country from despots and dictators 
only to lose our streets to drug dealers and gangs 
bush said of his visit to the storefront rock house which 
police raided may 2 its not show business anybody who has 
practical experience you learn from them you try to learn and 
understand and then take action its been extraordinarily 
helpful 
on the last day of a weeklong western campaign swing bush went 
to the police academy to deliver a speech praising the 
administrations drug enforcement efforts but adding we still 
have miles to go and we cant rest 
ill demand stronger penalties for drug offenders he said

in a series on drugs with a major one coming up outlining plans for

a sometimes bitter labor fight between 
harvard university and 3300 of its whitecollar employees is not 
necessarily over now that the workers have voted to unionize both 
sides said wednesday 
the day after the narrow union victory harvard officials said 
they may challenge the results with the national labor relations 
board while union representatives accused the university of 
violating labor laws and began preparing for contract negotiations 
that could last a year or more 
by a 1530 to 1486 vote the universitys clerical and 
technical workers 80 percent of whom are women approved a bid to 
organize under the american federation of state county and 
municipal employees 
were all ecstatic said kristine rondeau chief organizer 
of the union effort and a former harvard employee we want to 
make this a model for women everywhere 
harvard president derek bok who spent much of his academic 
career writing about labor issues and often praised unions was out 
of town wednesday and unavailable for comment according to the 
universitys press office 
but anne taylor the administrator directing harvards response 
to the union said in the event the nlrb declares the union the 
winner harvard will work constructively with the union in the 
interest of support staff and the university 
henry griggs afscme spokesman said harvards clerical workers 
have waited a long time for this but theyll have a fight on 
their hands theyll have to negotiate a contract but at least 
this time theyll have a voice 
rondeau didnt want to predict how long negotiations might last 
but taylor estimated that based on the experiences of yale and 
other schools it would take eight months to a year to develop the 
first contract 
taylor said university administrators are checking out 
complaints from individual workers that union supporters 
intimidated them during tuesdays voting university administrators 
have five working days to file a motion with the nlrb if they 
conclude the workers allegations could be grounds for throwing out 
the election 
the union leveled a countercharge that department supervisors 
sought to intimidate workers during the voting by pacing near 
polling places 
these were only the latest in a series of exchanges between the 
university and the union 
harvard has blasted the union for calling its efforts 
antiunion taylor said on election day that the union failed 
to offer any concrete gains to workers 
and in a letter sent last month to the clerical workers bok 
wrote that unions have typically resisted efforts to reward 
superior achievement 
even in victory rondeau refused to back down from her charge 
that the university broke labor law by telling workers that if a 
union was formed they would lose all their benefits and have to 
begin negotiating from zero 
in fact rondeau said negotiations will begin at current salary 
levels which the union says average about 18000 per year and the 
university puts at closer to 19000 
the union plans to seek increased pension benefits and an end to 
the practice of job reclassification which she called a 
euphemism for getting rid of older workers 
seven unions currently operate on the harvard campus 
representing 1300 workers in such fields as plumbing building 
maintenance cafeteria work and communications the afscme clerical 
union would cover such jobs as librarians secretaries biomedical 
assistants and copy center operaters 
bok who holds graduate degrees in law and economics and has 
been harvard president since 1971 has published books and articles 
in which he has often praised the us labor movement for example 
a 1971 harvard law review article said that nowhere else in the 
world but the united states can one find such an efflorescence of 
collectively bargained experiments providing imaginative benefits 
for workers

food costs are rising but farmers will get a 
smaller share of what consumers spend this year an agriculture 
department report said wednesday 
the food marketing bill or the difference between consumer 
expenditures and the farm value of domestically produced food is 
expected to increase 66 percent in 1988 compared with a 47 
percent gain last year 
food marketing includes the costs of transporting processing 
packaging and merchandising food after it leaves the farm 
while food expenditures will rise 48 percent about the same 
as the pace last year the farm value of food is expected to 
decline 1 percent because of bigger supplies and lower prices for 
livestock and poultry products the departments economic 
research service said 
during the first quarter consumer food costs rose 31 percent 
above a year earlier with much of the increase due to higher 
prices for fruit vegetables and fish 
prices for food served in restaurants and fastfood outlets 
rose a little faster than prices for food at home the report 
said for all of 1988 food prices are forecast to rise 2 percent 
to 4 percent from 1987 when they increased 41 percent 
the report continued to forecast 1988 net cash income of farmers 
at 50 billion to 55 billion down from last years record of 57 
billion rising production costs and lower federal payments to 
farmers are factors in this years decline

gov roy romer and mayor federico pena on 
wednesday went to the barren site of what could become the nations 
largest airport to celebrate voters decision to allow the city to 
annex 45 square miles of land for the project 
there still are a lot of people asking questions and thats 
fair pena said in a tent at the site we are going to get the 
project done and meet our goal to open the airport by the summer 
of 1994 
the proposal on tuesday won the support of 34070 voters in 
suburban adams county or 559 percent while 26928 or 441 
percent voted against it a total of 476 percent of the countys 
voters cast ballots 
denver proposes a 3 billion replacement for stapleton 
international airport now the fifthbusiest in the country the 
new airport 10 miles northeast of stapleton and 17 miles from 
downtown could be the secondbusiest in the nation by the year 
2000 estimates show 
pena said construction now is virtually assured this is the 
rocket booster that pushes the airport project forward he said 
but some financial issues remain unresolved and an environmental 
review and legal challenges are ahead if those are resolved 
ground for the new facility could be broken in the summer of 1989 
denver has asked for 500 million over five years in federal 
aid and the city this summer will turn over its environmental 
assessment to the federal aviation administration for review 
opponents who had expressed concern about increased air 
pollution jet noise and other environmental effects vowed to 
continue their fight 
hal shroyer of suburban westminster one of the most outspoken 
foes of the new airport has filed a lawsuit contesting the wording 
of the ballot issue 
i think the courts will throw the election out because of the 
faulty ballot title they put those six words in for the benefit 
of adams county shroyer said 
stapleton which is 59 years old would be torn down and the 
land converted for development and open space its replacement 
would be the first major airport built from scratch in the united 
states since the dallasfort worth airport was built in 1974 
nearly 35 million pasengers fly through stapleton every year 
but officials say faa projections indicate 50 million passengers 
are expected through denver by 1995 the new airport could 
accommodate 100 million passengers a year

ecumenical patriarch dimitrios will not 
attend celebrations in moscow marking the 1000th anniversary of 
christianity in russia orthodox church officials said wednesday 
dimitrios spiritual leader of the worlds 180 million orthodox 
christians refused to join the celebrations next month because 
they would include us and other orthodox leaders he doesnt 
recognize as independent 
the patriarch will not participate in a liturgy that includes 
the leaders of the russian orthodox churches of japan and north 
america said yiannis hadzifotis spokesman for the orthodox 
church of greece 
metropolitan bartholomew private secretary to the 
istanbulbased patriarch said only that patriarch would not attend 
because appropriate conditions for participation do not exist 
dimitrios also decided not to send a delegation from the 
patriarchate to the celebrations next month church officials in 
athens and istanbul said 
the orthodox church in america is derived from the russian 
orthodox church which granted the us church independent status 
in 1970 it is fully recognized by other eastern orthodox bodies in 
the united states but us church sources speaking on condition 
of anonymity said there may be some difficulty with dimitrios 
recognizing its independence 
the centerpiece of the 10day anniversary celebrations is a june 
5 service at moscows patriarchal cathedral the service was 
scheduled to be conducted by dimitrios with russian patriarch pimen 
and other orthodox patriarchs 
the communist party is officially atheist but soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev has backed the churchs millennium 
celebrations as part of his restructuring of society 
dimitrios made a publicized visit to the soviet union in august 
and said earlier this year he would attend the russian churchs 
millennium ceremonies 
hadzifotis said russian clerics organizing the celebrations have 
insisted that leaders of the russian orthodox churches of north 
america and japan take part in the june 5 service along with the 
head of the breakaway orthodox church of macedonia 
this is not correct none of these churches has been 
recognized as autocephalous independent by the ecumenical 
patriarchate and their leaders cannot be regarded as equal to the 
other patriarchs he said 
among orthodox patriarchs dimitrios is regarded as first among 
equals as head of the oldest orthodox church 
the russian churchs decision to grant the american and japanese 
churches independent status is a considered a serious breach of 
orthodox practice hadzifotis said 
dimitrios also objects to the russian churchs claim that the 
patriarchate of georgia should stand higher in the hierarchy than 
those of serbia bulgaria and romania he said 
normally a panorthodox conference would be required to upgrade 
the status of smaller orthodox churches 
in the eyes of other orthodox churches the russians 
unilateral actions are seen as an attempt to challenge the 
ecumenical patriarchs authority and dominate the course of 
orthodox christianity said a senior greek orthodox churchman who 
spoke on condition of anonymity

president reagan declared today that 
excessive drug politics is getting in the way of the battle 
against narcotics trafficking and urged that a congressional and 
executive branch task force be formed to recommend solutions 
speaking to the graduating class of the us coast guard academy 
here reagan called drug abuse the foremost concern in our 
country and said there must be a calming of political debate 
if americas antidrug effort gets tripped up in partisanship 
if we permit politics to determine policy it will mean a disaster 
for our future and that of our children he said 
sen alfonse damato rny one of the administrations 
harshest critics on drug policy scoffed at the tone of reagans 
speech saying in advance that the nation needs action not 
talk 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater on tuesday had said 
reagan was very frustrated about the progress of efforts to 
combat drug abuse 
reagan said in his speech that he was calling on both houses 
of the congress both sides of the aisle to join with my 
representatives in a special executivelegislative task force to 
advance americas unified response to the problem of illegal drug 
use 
he said the task force should find a consensus on ways to block 
the supply of illegal drugs reduce demand and improve interdiction 
efforts 
nothing should be overlooked or ruled out he said asking 
if we cannot remove the politics from drugs how can we hope to 
remove the drugs from our communities workplaces and schools 
reagan announced among other things that he has directed 
defense secretary frank c carlucci to tap the best minds both 
inside and outside of government to come up with creative solutions 
on how we can better use military resources and technologies to 
detect drugs 
it is time to make illegal drugs public enemy no 1 he 
said reagan in april 1987 had proclaimed aids as public enemy 
no 1 during a speech to a medical audience in philadelphia 
before the speech reagan arranged to visit the coast guard 
cutter vigorous for a briefing about its druginterdiction 
procedures and then have lunch with crew members before the speech 
to some 160 members of the 107th graduating class 
reagan spoke in the wake of harsh criticism of an administration 
offer to drop drugtrafficking indictments against panamanian 
strongman manuel antonio noriega in return for noriegas agreement 
to relinquish power 
reagan refused to confirm or deny the offer tuesday telling 
reporters that i cant comment on negotiations that are under 
way 
but the administrations move has infuriated many members of 
congress and has been injected into the presidential campaign and 
congressional debate over whether to increase the role of the us 
military in drug interdiction efforts 
white house chief of staff howard h baker jr told reporters 
today that by whatever means were going to use that noriega 
indictment to try to implement administration policy which is to 
see that noriega leaves power leaves the country and paves the way 
for democratic rule in that nation 
in his speech however reagan said our policy is one of 
zero tolerance for illegal drugs and we are looking for 
solutions not just a restatement of the problem 
the speech came amid growing sentiment in congress for tougher 
laws to deal with drug traffickers including proposals to impose 
the death sentence on those who commit murder in the drug trade 
fitzwater on tuesday said that there is much more to be done 
on both the demand and supply side of drug abuse 
he said reagan is very frustrated too with the progress 
against drugs 
i think the president hopes that people will be careful and 
realistic in discussions of where we go on the drug effort he 
said everybody wants to outdrug each other in terms of 
political rhetoric 
damato scoffed at the white houses claim to want politics 
taken out of the debate 
if we took action there wouldnt be any necessity for 
rhetoric he said its naive for his speechwriters to say 
drop the political rhetoric if they are going to make a deal 
with the scoundrel in panama

democrats on the house banking committee on 
wednesday introduced legislation that would dissolve a heavily 
criticized agency created to dispose of property from insolvent 
savings institutions 
the bill whose lead sponsors are reps paul e kanjorski 
dpa thomas c mcmillen dmd and house banking committee 
chairman fernand j st germain dri would abolish the federal 
asset disposition agency or fada within 60 days 
its functions would be turned over to the federal savings and 
loan insurance corp the government fund that insures sampl deposits 
up to 100000 
st germain told reporters he would attach the bill to 
legislation granting banks new powers including the ability to 
underwrite certain securities kanjorski said he expected the 
committee to act on that bill by june 15 
mcmillen said the 3yearold fada which oversees 42 billion 
in real estate and loans has spent more than 100 million and has 
managed to dispose of only 775 million in assets 
fada is a classic example of a government agency gone 
haywire kanjorski said 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
which regulates federally insured savings institutions has argued 
that new fada management installed in february is cleaning up the 
agency and trimming waste he said in a letter last week that 
dismantling fada would cost millions of dollars 
the dissolution bill is sponsored by 24 of the 30 democrats on 
the banking committee and one other democrat rep james j florio 
of new jersey it has no republican support

the military can do little to stem the flow of 
drugs into the united states a private study says 
there are dozens of ways of bringing drugs into the country 
and only a few of them can be effectively blocked by the 
military said rand corp economist peter reuter main author of 
the 154page report by the california think tank 
the pentagoncontracted report came in the wake of congressional 
votes to increase the use of the military in the war against drugs 
and president reagan on wednesday said he had directed defense 
secretary frank c carlucci to tap the best minds both inside and 
outside of government to come up with creative solutions on how we 
can better use military resources and technologies to detect and 
interdict drugs coming into this country 
carlucci has opposed using the military in the war against drugs 
nevertheless the house has passed a farreaching amendment to 
the 2995 billion defense authorization bill calling for the 
military to virtually seal off us borders to drugrunning 
the senate passed a slightly less sweeping version but the bill 
still gives the military a larger role in stopping the flow of 
illegal drugs into the country it would give new arrest powers to 
navy officers aboard warships that stop suspected drug boats on the 
high seas 
differences between the two bills will be resolved in a 
housesenate conference committee 
but reuter said using the military wont help 
smugglers adapt as interdictors make risks and costs higher 
smugglers shift to other methods of bringing drugs into the 
country he said in an interview tuesday 
reuter said his study found that use of the armed forces against 
drug smugglers has had little effect so far despite large 
increases in expenditures 
pentagon expenditures in the drug war rose from 1 million in 
1981 to 196 million in 1986 while nonmilitary expenditures rose 
from 263 million to 605 million 
seizures of cocaine rose from less than 2 million metric tons in 
1981 to more than 25 metric tons in 1986 but the amount of cocaine 
estimated to have entered the country jumped by 150 percent over 
the same period a metric ton is about 2200 pounds 
the main contribution of the military so far has been the use of 
radar planes to spot possible smugglers as they approach us 
shores the rand study said 
but the military may not shoot down suspected drug smugglers 
and groundbased law enforcement officials have had mixed results 
intercepting suspicious planes as they land 
reuter and two colleagues from rand gordon crawford and 
jonathon cave designed a computer model to determine the effect of 
increasing the risks and costs of smuggling drugs into the united 
states 
if a kilogram 22 pounds of cocaine costs 15000 to deliver 
to the united states it has a value of 250000 when sold on the 
street in one ounce packets they found 
tripling the smuggling cost will have a very small impact on 
the street value of the cocaine reuter said because the 
increase can be passed down the chain or partially absorbed in the 
huge retail price 
the report was prepared by rands national defense research 
institute which is funded by the pentagon

closing unneeded military bases is an idea 
whose time has come because of the present drive to cut federal 
spending and reduce the deficit defense secretary frank c 
carlucci said wednesday 
it makes sense to look seriously now at closing bases because 
our military force structure is being reduced and growth in the 
defense budget is being slowed carlucci told a house 
subcommittee 
we must stop spending money to operate bases we do not need 
he said our increasingly scarce resources simply must be applied 
to higher defense priorities so that we do not jeopardize 
americas national security interests 
carlucci was testifying in support of a plan designed to 
surmount the strong reluctance of congress to allow military bases 
to be closed 
the nation has about 3800 military installations and pentagon 
officials estimate that between 2 billion and 5 billion annually 
could be saved if unneeded bases were shut down 
but bases mean jobs and congress has erected such strong 
barriers against base closures that no major installations have 
been closed since 1977 
the current plan calls for creation of a pentagon commission to 
review bases by dec 31 and recommend a list of which can be 
closed carlucci would then have 15 days to accept or reject the 
entire list his decision would be made less than a week before the 
end of president reagans term in office 
the bill offered by rep richard armey rtexas proposes having 
carlucci pick a ninemember commission 
the defense budget bill now pending in the senate calls for a 
15member commission including the nine persons already chosen by 
carlucci and six more who would be selected by carlucci after 
consultation with capitol hill 
the last time the pentagon suggested closing any bases was in 
1985 when a list of 22 was sent to capitol hill but congressional 
outcries halted any action 
using that list as an example carlucci said 6 million could 
have been saved in each of the past two years had the bases been 
shut down 
the list was put together when the pentagon budget was growing 
said carlucci today the opportunity for realignments and 
closures is surely greater than it was three years ago 
we dont expect a larger fighting force he said the air 
force has fewer fighter wings than it was forecasting in 1985 the 
navy has fewer ships than it proposed and the army has fewer combat 
elements a smaller more robust base structure makes far more 
sense now than it has at any time over the past 10 years 
armey said theres been an important twist in the 
baseclosing debate were no longer talking about if we can 
close obsolete bases were talking about how we can close 
obsolete bases 
the commission plan also proposes a onetime waiver that would 
allow the bases to be shut down without going through the complex 
and lengthy environmental reports now required of the pentagon 
carlucci said there was a widespread misconception that base 
closures cause the local community to suffer devastating economic 
effects 
the truth is quite different he said the facts are that 
most communities affected by previous base closures have had strong 
economic recovery 
a pentagon survey of 100 communities where bases had been closed 
show that 94000 defense department civilian jobs were lost but 
they had been replaced by 138000 new civilian jobs he said

michael dukakis said wednesday he doubted jesse jackson would 
pick a fight at the democratic national convention this summer and 
added he hopes to select a running mate before the session 
convenes vice president george bush visited a onetime drug 
hangout to dramatize his opposition to drugs 
jackson met with jewish leaders in california in hopes of 
defusing suspicions over his candidacy one rabbi spoke of a 
reconciliation but demonstrators outside booed jackson and 
chanted lose jesse lose 
dukakis fresh from tuesdays landslide victory in the oregon 
primary is the faraway favorite in public opinion polls in 
california he hopes to clinch a nominating majority by the time 
the primary season ends in three weeks with elections in 
california new jersey montana and new mexico 
the massachusetts governor also has received good news in 
nationwide polling matchups against bush in recent days and top 
bush aides were quoted as being particularly concerned over 
indications that their man is viewed unfavorably by a large 
percentage of voters 
if those numbers are that way by election time its pretty 
insurmountable bushs chief of staff craig fuller said in an 
interview with the boston globe but fuller and other aides said 
bushs standing as measured by the polls could improve dramatically 
virtually overnight 
bush wrapping up a weeklong west coast campaign swing spent 
about 15 minutes in a storefront in los angeles that police said 
had been a drug location he said he would not bargain with drug 
dealers as president whether they were in the united states or 
on foreign soil 
still he refused once again to offer an opinion on reports of 
reagan administration plea bargaining with panamanian leader manuel 
noriega who is under us indictment on drug charges 
in a speech before flying home bush said he would mount an 
attack against drugs that would be nothing less than a modern 
dday and urged his democratic rivals to join him in calling for 
tougher penalties for convicted drug dealers 
dukakis made no mention of bush at a news conference in boston 
instead he said he doubted jackson would mar the anticipated 
tranquility at the partys nominating convention by challenging 
delegate selection rules 
i dont think we are going to have a fight with mr jackson at 
the convention he said 
jackson has complained in recent weeks that his support among 
super delegates party leaders who will have voting rights at 
the convention does not match his success in primaries dukakis 
said jackson has a perfect right to voice criticism but noted 
that jackson knew the rules before entering the race 
even so top aides to jackson released the text of a letter they 
sent to democratic chairman paul kirk saying that the vote of 
the people is distorted by dukakis overwhelming advantage in 
super delegates 
as for his vice presidential running mate dukakis said he would 
not turn his attention to the search until the primary season is 
concluded 
if im the nominee i would hope that the decision will be made 
before the convention sure or at least the recommendations he 
said 
paul brountas a law school classmate and close friend of the 
governor is expected to head the search effort 
dukakis made his comments before heading off to campaign stops 
in new york and new jersey 
jackson already was in california where he is mounting an 
intense primary campaign he said his 90minute session with a 
dozen los angles area rabbis and other jewish leaders was the 
beginning of a meaningful and indepth dialogue with critics of 
his candidacy 
he said the sesson was a step toward healing wounds 
one participant rabbi allen freehling said the litany of 
complaints in the jewish community with jesse jackson was aired 
and there was a reconciliation 
outside the session though a dozen demonstrators chanted 
lose jesse lose and jew hater 
many jews have been suspicious of jackson in part because of his 
1979 meeting with yasser arafat the head of the palestine 
liberation organization his 1984 reference to new york as 
hymietown and other incidents

bill cosby was coy about whether 198889 would 
be the final season for the cosby show but he said hes going 
all out next year 
this is our fifth season and its supposed to be our last so 
im going to have my fun this year not in messing up but in 
doing things even better said cosby who appeared at nbcs 
unveiling of its fall schedule for advertisers 
he has previously said he would only do the show five years in 
its four seasons so far it has consistently been the toprated 
network show and is credited with making nbc the no 1 network 
if hes having fun and hes got stories to tell we might 
convince him to come back said nbc entertainment president 
brandon tartikoff adding that nbc had held no formal talks with 
cosby 
cosby gave a plug to the striking writers guild of america 
promising the show would be as good as ever once we get our 
writers back 
theyre asking for more money and theyre going to get it 
if they dont come back its all over for tv and you all have 
no jobs 
the 2monthold strike centers on creative control and royalties 
from syndication 
cosby pleaded mostly tongueincheek with the advertisers to 
buy time on his show next season a frequent pitchman for a number 
of products he added some of you have not called me to do 
commercials for you i have your names 
as for a different world the critically bludgeoned but 
commercially successful spinoff of his show cosby said a 
different world is sort of a payback a chance to see a child who 
says i know what im doing go off and take care of him or 
herself weve gotten rid of all the people who didnt know what it 
was about 
debbie allen a former producer on fame has been brought in

the nevada supreme court issued an 
opinion wednesday reaffirming an order issued in november to let 
ousted federal judge harry claiborne practice law despite 
imprisonment for tax evasion 
justice tom steffen wrote the longawaited formal opinion which 
concludes that no further punishment should be imposed on 
claiborne 71 who spent 17 months behind bars after being 
impeached as a us district judge in october 1986 
claiborne was named a federal judge in 1978 he was impeached 
following his conviction for failing to report 107000 on his 1979 
and 1980 tax returns the impeachment was the first of its sort in 
more than a halfcentury 
claiborne maintained he was a victim of a justice department 
vendetta he alleged misconduct by federal agents and bias on the 
part of his trial judge walter hoffman 
the case against claiborne started out as an investigation into 
allegations that claiborne took a 30000 bribe to derail an fbi 
probe into brothel owner joe conforte a trial in reno on bribery 
and other charges resulted in a hung jury and a retrial on the 
bribery charge was thrown out 
claiborne born in mcrae ark got his law degree from 
cumberland university and was admitted to the arkansas bar in 1942 
he was admitted to the nevada bar a few years later worked two 
years as a deputy prosecutor and also served as a oneterm 
democratic state assemblyman 
in his opinion justice steffen outlined the history of 
claibornes removal from office the claims of investigatory 
misconduct the federal governments bargain with conforte 
claibornes trial his professional background and the tension 
between federal agents and nevadas federal judges 
steffen said it was regrettable that claiborne was unable to get 
evidentiary hearings into his claims of bias and misconduct adding 
that there was evidence within the federal justice department of 
appalling arrogance contemptuousness and a lack of decorum 
if our review of the record had enabled us to conclude in 
good conscience that claiborne had been fairly prosecuted and 
convicted we unhesitatingly would have imposed severe sanctions 
steffen said 
he stressed that the high courts decision wasnt based simply 
on legal technicalities and acknowledge that some critics would 
disagree with the ruling 
but claibornes felony conviction while serious was no 
ordinary conviction steffen said questionable investigative 
and prosecutorial motivations as well as anomalous and arguably 
unfair practices and procedures pervade the record of this matter 
from its inception 
the ruling included a separate 9page concurring statement from 
chief justice al gunderson who said it was fortunate the claiborne 
case didnt end with his total annihilation 
gunderson concluded that the federal governments pursuit of 
claiborne began with a fixed purpose but without any evidence 
whatever that the us district court judge should be destroyed

families and friends of some of the 16 people 
killed in last years amtrak crash in maryland visited capitol hill 
on wednesday to urge lawmakers to approve a longstalled 
drugtesting bill 
we can sit at home and cry about whats happened or come down 
here and tell these people to move ahead said dr roger horn of 
hunt valley md 
horn whose daughter ceres 16 died in the accident and about 
100 other people spent their day visiting the offices of the 432 
members of the house 
their focus was legislation that would require random mandatory 
drug and alcohol testing for railroad airline bus and trucking 
industry employees the measure would affect about 33 million of 
the nations transportation workers 
the proposal has been the subject of housesenate negotiations 
since the beginning of the year it has been the major obstacle to 
the completion of work on an airline passenger consumer protection 
bill into which it was inserted by the senate the version of the 
bill passed by the house contains no drugtesting provision 
rep john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and 
commerce committee has jurisdiction over bills affecting railroad 
workers and has so far opposed the testing provision he has 
expressed fears about rampant incompetence and faulty procedures 
of the nations laboratories 
but sen john danforth rmo a leading sponsor of the testing 
measure said at a news conference wednesday the key to solving 
the problem of drug and alcohol use by people in safety related 
transportation jobs is testing which includes mandatory random 
testing 
according to the department of transportation in the first 14 
months after the jan 4 1987 amtrak accident at chase md there 
were 37 rail accidents in which one or more workers tested 
positively afterward for illegal drug use and four accidents in 
which alcohol use was detected 
the national transportation safety board has concluded that 
marijuana use was the primary cause of the maryland accident in 
which three linked conrail engines passed a stop signal and ran in 
front of a crowded amtrak commuter train sixteen people were 
killed and 175 injured 
also wednesday federal aviation administration spokesman dick 
stafford said 39 air traffic controllers and other agency workers 
have been relieved from their duties after testing positive for 
drug use since the faa began the examinations last year 
of those 31 are still employed by the faa but may be undergoing 
drug rehabilitation programs five resigned and three have been 
fired according to staffords figures 
during the period 1652 faa workers received random drug tests 
and 25161 others were tested as part of their annual medical 
exams he said 
stafford presented the figures after danforth cited similar 
numbers at the news conference

using the armed forces in an allout assault on 
drug trafficking would involve civil rights tradeoffs americans may 
not want to contemplate the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff 
said wednesday 
to solve the drug problem and still guarantee all americans 
the rights and privileges they enjoy today is a difficult thing 
adm william j crowe jr told a news conference before a luncheon 
speech at the economic club of detroit 
crowe chairman of the joint chiefs since october 1985 said the 
armed forces would carry out whatever antidrug trade measures 
congress assigned them 
i think there are things we can do primarily identification 
surveillance and tracking of people bringing in drugs in illicit 
fashion he said 
but he said to truly stop the flow of drugs you would have to 
increase police powers and do some searches and seizures that are 
not contemplated today 
crowe also said he foresaw no quick end to us military 
involvement in the persian gulf and no increased activity in panama 
he referred to negotiations aimed at persuading panamanian ruler 
manuel antonio noriega to leave the us government is 
interested in bringing that about he said 
he said he did not expect increased us military activity in 
panama but said the united states would defend its strategic 
interest in keeping the panama canal open

the provietnamese government of 
cambodia has convened an unprecedented national congress to discuss 
ways to fight guerrilla infiltration of villages 
representatives of about 500 model communes across the country 
attended the opening of the congress in the capital phnom penh on 
monday the official communist party newspaper pracheachon said 
the paper said while the cambodian government has made advances 
guerrillas were conducting psychological warfare along the thai 
border area with impunity 
the paper said the partys ruling politburo considers the 
localities as a matter of life or death to the revolution as 
the core battlefield and the work of building and consolidating 
localities villages communes units and army bases as the key 
task in 1988 
vietnam invaded cambodia in late 1978 ousting the khmer rouge 
rulers the communist khmer rouge now forms the largest of three 
guerrilla groups 
pracheachon said the guerrillas were moving into the interior of 
the country to spread propaganda against the government and 
encourage criticism of vietnam it said the rebels were planting 
agents and preparing for 1990 when vietnam has said it will 
withdraw the last of its troops from cambodia 
the cambodian government is trying to lure guerrillas and their 
supporters back to the fold with promises of amnesty jobs and 
rewards 
however the paper said the enemy is still able to conduct 
his activities at a number of remote villages and communes along 
the cambodianthai border frequently making unchecked entries 
into exits from and passages through these localities and 
intimidating the local people with impunity 
a text of the papers editorial was obtained from a western 
embassy in bangkok on wednesday 
cambodians are torn between deepseated enmity for vietnam and 
for the khmer rouge which massacred hundreds of thousands of 
people during its nearly fouryear rule 
on may 10 khmer rouge radio claimed that guerrillas smashed the 
vietnamese administrative network in more than 4000 villages and 
200 communes during the sevenmonth dry season that ended in april 
vietnam was forced to transfer important units from the 
thaicambodian border to the interior to defend against attacks it 
claimed 
however khmer rouge claims are widely regarded as exaggerated

social security and welfare recipients in 
urban areas have the most difficulty getting their government 
checks cashed by banks where they do not have an account the 
general accounting office told congress on wednesday 
some individuals do not have depository accounts and are not 
able to cash their checks at local banks or thrifts assistant 
comptroller general richard l fogel told a senate banking 
subcommittee 
instead he said they cash their checks at check cashers 
grocery stores liquor stores bars and with relatives 
fogel released a preliminary report to the panel which found 
that the unbanked population of the united states is at the lower 
end of the income scale relies relatively heavily on government 
benefit programs includes a significant percentage of the 
unemployed and most have 12 years or less of education 
consumer groups argue that in 1987 anywhere between 71 percent 
and 88 percent of the banks and thrifts would not cash checks for 
noncustomers at any price the gao indicated that in 1985 nearly 
86 percent of banks and 55 percent of thrifts cashed treasury 
checks for nondepositors 
fogel said he saw no disparity between the statistics because 
the consumer groups studies targeted urban areas while the gao 
report was nationwide including rural and suburban as well as 
urban areas 
fogel said there is no current nationally representative survey 
of the check cashing experience nonetheless it is our 
impression that access is considerably more of a problem in urban 
locations than in rural ones he said 
the report of the gao investigative arm of congress said banks 
do not cash government checks for nondepositors because of the 
costs involved in performing the service free of charge congestion 
of their facilities and potential fraud 
fogel testified before the senate banking consumer affairs 
subcommittee on legislation sponsored by sen howard metzenbaum 
dohio to require banks to cash government checks for 
nondepositors once they have registered with the bank a similar 
measure has been introduced in the house 
my bill would ensure that individuals do not have to chase all 
over town to cash their government checks metzenbaum said and 
it would ensure that senior citizens and low income persons were 
not charged exorbitant fees for the privilege of cashing such 
checks 
rep fernand j st germain chairman of the house banking 
committee said he favored the metzenbaum bill and a similar one 
introduced by rep charles e schumer dny in the house 
st germain said any comprehensive banking bill passed by 
congress this year will contain a version of required checkcashing 
legislation both metzenbaum and schumer have said they are willing 
to modify their proposals but that the banking industry has opposed 
any such effort 
august zinsser iii representing the american bankers 
association told the committee the legislation would subject banks 
to large fraud losses and is premature inappropriate and unfair 
to depository institutions 
zinsser said this legislation presents a window of 
opportunity for individuals to use banks to perpetuate fraud 
through the pretext of cashing checks organized crime in 
particular would find the bill particularly useful and 
profitable 
however in answer to a question by metzenbaum fogel said the 
gao study found the actual dollar amount the treasury department 
reclaims from banks and thrifts or refuses payment on to be smaller 
than the claims of banking groups imply 
fogel said the final gao report would be published in september 
but doubted that there would be any major changes

the navy said wednesday it had decided to 
return the minedamaged frigate samuel b roberts from the persian 
gulf aboard a commercial heavylift ship 
the service said it hoped to award a contract for the ferry 
operation in the next few days and then load the frigate in 
midjune for the trip back to the united states 
the navy announced april 29 the ship would be repaired at the 
bath iron works in bath maine where it was built 
the alternative to having another ship carry the vessel back to 
the united states would involve performing fairly extensive repairs 
and then towing it home the navy said the ship is currently in 
dry dock in dubai united arab emirates 
according to the navy a number of companies that operate 
heavylift ships were asked to bid on the job recently there are 
probably about two dozen such ships in the world capable of doing 
the job the service said such vessels are normally used to carry 
huge oildrilling rigs to new locations 
with the exception of approximately 10 crewmen who will ride 
the heavylift ship the crew of the uss roberts will fly to their 
home port of newport ri when their ship departs for the united 
states the navy said 
the roberts was badly damaged by a mine on april 14 shortly 
after completing a convoy operation for a reflagged kuwaiti tanker 
navy officials have said the frigate almost certainly would have 
sunk had it not been for the performance of its crew

for information leading to a conviction and sent four of its 
crimeprevention investigators to the scene said ron hingst a 
spokesman for the ann arbor michbased pizza chain

to the store after waiting more than 45 minutes for the delivery of 
his pizza 
the front of the store was dark but you could see lights on 
in the back said lawing 29 the door was open so i just 
poked my head in and yelled hello a couple of times i knew 
something was wrong so i got the police

hanging bricks around youngsters 
necks was just a gimmick so theyd remember their pencils and 
supplies school officials said wednesday but the state said the 
school district should forget the whole practice 
four fifth and sixthgraders were required to carry the bricks 
in their hands or around their necks in late april if they 
repeatedly forgot to take supplies from one class to another said 
superintendent james bogue 
it was not a punishment it was a gimmick an attempt to get 
students to bring the proper supplies to school bogue said we 
needed some type of reminder 
i would say it was unusual but it wasnt unsafe he added 
it wasnt used to intimidate the children i dont even consider 
the practice to be bad 
the brick discipline worked so officials in this district about 
125 miles northeast of houston stopped using it bogue said but on 
may 9 a parent called the texas education agency to complain 
we told the school that it was an inappropriate form of 
discipline and to stop it tea spokeswoman terri moore said 
wednesday but its not illegal and it does not violate state 
policies or rules 
no formal complaints which would have led to an investigation 
were filed she said 
bogue said the students were told they would have to carry the 
bricks to class as reminders to take the proper supplies to the 
next class 
the students one girl and three boys had to have the bricks 
with them for one day each he said they were told they could 
either carry them or hang them around their necks 
a string was provided but they were not ordered to wear it

rest on the students books

hes been diagnosed as being hyperactive and has mental 
problems the boys grandmother annie m barclay said wednesday 
a child cant learn anything with a brick tied around his neck 
when he was in school the other kids would call him and when hed 
turn the brick would hit him in the face its pure humiliation 
but bogue said the child who lives with the grandmother in 
nacogdoches has a behavior problem not a learning disability and 
has been sent to the principals office numerous times 
ms barclay said her son plans to attend a central heights 
school board meeting thursday to question the discipline 
the superintendent said parents of two of the children involved

its just been blown way out of proportion bogue said it 
is unusual i agree it would have been better if we had not done

israeli soldiers backed by 
helicopters and bulldozers raided two arab mountain villages 
wednesday hundreds of stonethrowing palestinians surrounded the 
force and one arab was killed the army said 
arab doctors and witnesses said 10 arabs were wounded with live 
ammunition at least 20 received injuries from beatings and rubber 
bullets and hundreds were arrested 
in a separate incident troops shot and wounded four arabs in 
the marketplace in nablus the largest west bank city an army 
spokesman said he said the soldiers fired to disperse people who 
had attacked them with stones 
after the fighting in the two mountain villages army officials 
confirmed one dead and four wounded they refused comment on 
arrests or the reason for the raid which came at the end of the 
threeday id el fitr holiday marking the conclusion of ramadan the 
moslem holy month of fasting 
the violence occurred a day after israeli soldiers clashed with 
arab guerrillas who slipped into israel from jordan one arab was 
wounded and captured and two escaped it was the 13th infiltration 
or attempted infiltration in six months 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said palestinian guerrilla groups 
have stepped up infiltration attempts to give a new impetus to the 
23weekold arab uprising which he said was dying down 
since antioccupation protests began dec 8 in the west bank and 
gaza strip israeli soldiers have killed 191 palestinians two 
israelis have also died the lands were seized by israel in the 
1967 middle east war 
rabin accused jordan and egypt of not doing enough to prevent 
the infiltrations guerrillas have twice tried to enter israel from 
egypt since dec 1 
there is no doubt in my mind the authorities in egypt and 
jordan are sometimes not doing everything that can be done to 
prevent the infiltrations rabin told israel radio 
hundreds of israeli soldiers moved into the neighboring villages 
of abwein and arura about 17 miles north of jerusalem before dawn 
wednesday 
an israeli force reached the villages as part of an initiated 
action and was surrounded by hundreds of arabs some of whom 
climbed nearby hills and attacked the force with a barrage of 
stones and with slingshots the army said 
it said soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets and a 
commander shot live ammunition to quell the protests 
in both villages the fighting continued through the morning 
with helicopters dropping tear gas witnesses said soldiers 
eventually gained control and moved from house to house to search 
for suspects they said 
in arura troops rounded up about 300 young men in a schoolyard 
said a 19yearold palestinian speaking from his hospital bed in 
nearby ramallah 
the teenager speaking on condition of anonymity said a 
soldier kicked him in the head the mans right eye was swollen 
shut 
in abwein soldiers made no arrests apparently because most 
youths fled into the hills said saam 48 a local merchant who 
would give only his first name 
but in housetohouse searches troops beat several women and 
smashed furniture saam said 
both abwein and arura were what palestinians call liberated 
villages as a sign of defiance against the army the residents 
have kept the villages sealed off with roadblocks flown outlawed 
palestinian flags on rooftops and marked walls with proplo 
graffiti 
army officials noted that under current policy troops carry out 
operations even in isolated villages to maintain order and show a 
presence 
during a tour of abwein an associated press reporter saw arabic 
graffiti covered with white paint residents said soldiers had 
forced them to whitewash the slogans 
bulldozers pushed aside roadblocks and residents later showed a 
reporter fragments of garden walls they said were knocked down 
villagers said soldiers also forced them to take down 
palestinian flags 
a black flag of mourning fluttered from the home of majdi 
youssef hilal the 16yearold youth who was fatally shot in the 
chest during the clashes 
doctors at ramallah hospital treated bullet wounds of nine 
villagers including five in serious condition dr yasser obeid 
director of the hospital said five others suffered serious beating 
injuries

president reagan said wednesday the 
battle against illegal drugs is in danger of being tripped up 
by political debate and proposed a bipartisan task force to find a 
consensus within 45 days on all aspects of the antinarcotics 
campaign 
if we cannot remove the politics from drugs how can we hope 
to remove the drugs from our communities workplaces and schools 
reagan said in a commencement address at the us coast guard 
academy 
reagans speech highlighted the growing importance of drugs as a 
political issue in the presidential campaign and on capitol hill 
it has been a staple of jesse jacksons stump speeches and is 
raised with increasing frequency by fellow democrat michael dukakis 
and republican george bush 
moreover there is sharp criticism from republicans and 
democrats alike particularly in congress of an administration 
offer to drop drugtrafficking indictments against panamanian 
military ruler manuel antonio noriega in return for noriegas 
agreement to relinquish power 
reagan standing under gray rainthreatening skies addressed 
159 whiteuniformed graduating cadets and their relatives from a 
stage in front of the thames river 
illegal drug use is the foremost concern in our country and 
frankly as i finish my final year in office and look ahead i 
worry that excessive drug politics might undermine effective drug 
policy the president said 
if americas antidrug effort gets tripped up in partisanship 
if we permit politics to determine policy it will mean a disaster 
for our future and that of our children he added 
earlier reagan toured the coast guard cutter vigorous and 
inspected weapons and satchels of cocaine seized by federal 
authorities 
over lunch with the crew reagan offered a new defense of 
embattled attorney general edwin meese iii when a reporter asked 
about conservatives unhappiness over the firing of justice 
department spokesman terry eastland 
i think some will keep on trying to make a fuss over him 
meese reagan said so far theyre all empty charges 
in his speech reagan did not mention the noriega controversy 
he urged that democrats and republicans from the house and senate 
join with administration representatives to advance americas 
unified response to the problem of illegal drug use 
specifically he said the proposed task force should produce a 
report on issues such as how the military should be involved in the 
campaign and whether the death penalty should be imposed when a 
police officer or other people are killed as a resullt of drug 
trafficking 
our task force should agree on solutions for every area of the 
drug problem from blocking supplies to curtailing demand from 
treatment to education to prosecution from interdiction and 
confiscation to eradication nothing should be overlooked or ruled 
out the president said 
our policy should be one of zero tolerance for illegal 
drugs and we are looking for solutions not just a restatement of 
the problem he added 
there appears to be a growing sentiment in congress for 
increasing the role of the military in interdicting drugs reagan 
said the government should consider allowing governors greater use 
of the national guard in the effort 
but one thing must be clear when it comes to the military 
lets give them a clear mission for specific situations the 
president said 
he said he had directed defense secretary frank c carlucci to 
ask experts inside and outside the government for suggestions on 
how to use military resources to detect and prevent drug smuggling 
sen christopher dodd dconn who was a guest on air force one 
on the flight to his home state agreed with reagan that drugs are 
becoming politicized 
things are getting a little crazy out there dodd said 
people are making a feeding frenzy out of the issue the 
waters have been so choppy that if you offer an amendment on 
anything itll carry 
but sen lowell weicker rconn who also accompanied reagan on 
his plane said youre not going to depoliticize the issue 
every candidates going to talk about it 
likewise sen alfonse damato rny scoffed at reagans 
remarks 
if we took action there wouldnt be any necessity for 
rhetoric damato said its naive for his speechwriters to 
say drop the political rhetoric if they are going to make a 
deal with the scoundrel in panama 
as for the bipartisan commission damato said it is 
unfortunate that it took the congress to drag the administration 
kicking and screaming to the altar on doing something about 
drugs 
in washington rep duncan hunter of california a republican 
member of the house select committee on narcotics said the 
administration was not to blame alone for problems in the war on 
drugs he said the house democratic leadership tried to block his 
amendment to the defense authorization bill that would require the 
military to seal us borders against drug smugglers within 45 days 
after enactment 
the amendment passed 38523 but its fate will be decided in a 
housesenate conference 
besides hunters amendment the house and senate by large 
bipartisan majorities have adopted several provisions in the past 
two weeks urging reagan and his administration to do more in the 
war against drugs 
the senate on an 836 vote approved a plan giving the military 
a new role in the antidrug war but one less farreaching than 
proposed by the house 
earlier this week the senate approved 950 an amendment by 
sen jesse helms rnc ordered a halt to us aid to panama 
until noriega leaves 
by 8610 the senate approved a resolution by senate gop leader 
bob dole of kansas opposing any deal with noriega in which the drug 
trafficking charges are dropped

about 24 million ethiopians living in two 
northern provinces may be facing starvation because the ethiopian 
government has placed severe limits on deliveries of emergency food 
provided by international donors a us government expert said 
wednesday 
dr frederick machmer jr the top official of the agency for 
international development in ethiopia said a food distribution 
program run by ethiopian authorities is reaching only about 780000 
persons in eritrea and tigray provinces less than a quarter of 
their combined populations 
both provinces are wracked by drought and antigovernment 
rebellions government control in these provinces basically is 
limited to their respective capitals and the authorities are not 
allowing food deliveries beyond these areas machmer said 
every sign we have is that a bad situation is not getting any 
better machmer told a small group of reporters 
he said food availability is no problem noting that 
international donors have promised ethiopia 14 million metric tons 
of food for the rest of the year in addition to restrictions on 
food deliveries the ethiopian government ordered most foreign 
relief workers out of the two provinces last month 
machmer said representatives of private organizations have 
volunteered to deliver food by truck to the interior of the two 
provinces but ethiopian authorities have refused the offer 
contending they would be blamed if the volunteers were harmed 
the united states has offered to donate just under 250000 
metric tons of food to ethiopia the soviet union a close ally of 
ethiopia has said it will donate 250000 tons but has not 
indicated it will pay for food transportation costs machmer said

japanese police complained that soviet 
officials refuse to cooperate with investigators looking into a 
fire aboard a docked soviet liner wednesday that killed at least 11 
passengers 
in moscow the soviet government newspaper izvestia said that 
besides the 11 confirmed dead one person was missing and not 
likely to be found alive 
the fire broke out about 130 am aboard the 4870ton 
priamurye and smoke and flames trapped most of the victims as they 
slept in their cabins on the lowest of three passenger decks 
izvestia said the blaze may have started in a passenger cabin on 
the lower deck but that the cause had not been established 
japanese police said earlier that the fire was discovered in an 
area above the engine room 
the official soviet news agency tass said in a brief dispatch 
about the fire that some of the injured soviets were in critical 
condition 
japans kyodo news service said police were investigating 
careless smoking or an engineroom problem as possible causes of 
the fire 
norimasa watanabe chief of the guard rescue department of the 
maritime safety agency in osaka told the associated press he 
suspected the cause would be careless smoking or faulty wiring but 
that he wouldnt know until he had a chance to examine the ship on 
thursday 
police said the victims were all soviet citizens who were on a 
goodwill visit to japan sponsored by the communist youth league it 
took 18 hours to extinguish the blaze and the ship was left 
blackened and listing at the osaka docks 
yoshihide yasuda spokesman for osaka prefectural police said 
police wanted to question the soviets about the blaze but soviet 
consular officials refused to sign papers permitting it 
they think its not important to check what happened and they 
even think its strange that we want to investigate yasuda told 
a news conference 
yasada said the fire department and the maritime safety agency 
would launch a formal investigation thursday 
yasuda said a second soviet ship was arriving at this port in 
western japan on friday to take home survivors from the 295 
passengers and 129 crew members aboard the priamurye he said it 
would not be possible to keep them from leaving 
in 1982 police were unable to complete investigation of a fire 
on a soviet ship in the port of yokohama for the same reason 
yasuda said no one was killed in the 1982 fire 
yasuda said officials planned to question the ships captain 
aleksandr yerastov 10 passengers who witnessed the blaze and 15 
crew members employed as security personnel 
yasuda said police and firefighters had been through the gutted 
ship in a preliminary probe but the soviets had asked them not to 
enter the engine room 
the 406footlong priamurye had sailed from vladivostok on may 7 
and had stopped in otaru on the northern japanese island of 
hokkaido and in tokyo before arriving in osaka tuesday 
yasuda said 15 people remained hospitalized with burns and smoke 
inhalation and 20 others were treated and released 
survivors were taken first to a junior high school gymnasium 
near the port and then to hotels 
japans foreign ministry offered condolences to soviet 
ambassador nikolai soloviev soloviev said he thanked japan for its 
help 
izvestia said that among the passengers were large delegations 
from the soviet republics of uzbekistan and moldavia as well as 
from moscow

us district judge alcee l hastings of miami 
demanded wednesday that a house impeachment panel dismiss 
misconduct allegations brought by fellow judges after his acquittal 
on bribery conspiracy charges five years ago 
i am not guilty but i am not free hastings said in his 
impassioned plea at the start of impeachment hearings by a house 
judiciary subcommittee whose chairman suggested the case against 
floridas first black federal judge might be racially and 
politically motivated 
hastings who was nominated for the federal bench by president 
carter in 1979 was acquitted in 1983 of conspiring to solicit a 
150000 bribe from two convicted racketeers in exchange for a 
promise of lenient sentences 
but a special fivejudge panel of the 11th us circuit court of 
appeals in atlanta concluded after a 3year investigation that 
there was clear and convincing evidence that hastings had 
engaged in a bribery conspiracy and tried to conceal it by lying 
under oath and fabricating evidence at his highly publicized trial 
in miami 
the panels 381page report was endorsed unanimously by the 
27member judicial conference of the united states the chief 
policymaking body of the federal judiciary the conference 
forwarded the report to the house leadership with the conclusion 
that consideration of impeachment may be warranted 
the house judiciary subcommittee on criminal justice after 
conducting its own intensive investigation for more than a year 
opened public hearings wednesday by allowing hastings to deliver a 
sworn statement 
hastings said he was the first federal judge in us history to 
be threatened with impeachment after his acquittal of criminal 
charges 
they found me not guilty of crimes i never committed he 
said 
let me make it very very clear hastings said i have not 
received a bribe i have not obstructed justice and i have not 
betrayed the integrity of the high office that i hold 
his voice rising hastings declared 
i am not guilty but i am not free and i ask you in the name 
of decency in the name of justice in the name of the american 
jury system i ask you in the name of the american way of life 
i beg you i beseech you i implore you hell no i tell you and i 
demand of you that you set me free 
the subcommittee then heard from new york lawyer john doar a 
former assistant us attorney general in the johnson 
administration who reviewed the massive evidence used in the 
investigation he conducted for the appellate panel that charged 
hastings with judicial misconduct 
subcommittee members listened to a series of secretly taped 
conversations and telephone calls in september and october 1981 
involving washington lawyer william a borders and an fbi 
undercover agent posing as racketeer frank romano 
borders was convicted at a separate trial in 1982 on charges to 
arrange the alleged bribe from romano and his brother thomas 
doar said one taped telephone call between borders and hastings 
also played for the subcommittee was a coded conversation that 
concerned the bribery transaction and whether the person they 
thought was frank romano had actually made an initial 25000 down 
payment 
after its factfinding hearings the panel must decide whether 
to recommend impeachment to the full judiciary committee if the 
committee approves articles of impeachment against hastings they 
must be submitted to a house floor vote 
if the house impeaches hastings which would be tantamount to an 
indictment a senate trial would be held a twothirds majority of 
senators would be required to convict hastings of high crimes and 
misdemeanors and force his removal from the federal bench 
hastings lawyers charged in a statement that doar was an 
incompetent witness who was relying on hearsay information they 
also alleged that the appellate panels report includes 
incomplete inaccurate and inadmissible evidence that is 
insufficient to produce a conviction at any senate impeachment 
trial 
the house has never in its 200year history used its 
impeachment powers to inquire into charges gainst a federal judge 
that a jury had rejected after a full trial the lawyers said 
the racial and political overtones of the impeachment inquiry 
were cited by rep john conyers jr dmich the subcommittee 
chairman as soon as he opened the hearing 
conyers said the proceedings were exceedingly difficult and 
trying because hastings had already been acquitted by a trial 
jury and because he is a leader of the black community in florida 
conyers who is black said his subcommittee had taken 
cognizance of racially motivated conduct in this country for many 
many years particularly in the criminal justice system 
he said the federal judiciary had become conservatized and in 
some instances politicized during the reagan administration we 
are not unaware of or naive about the troubling matters that hover 
over this particular hearing today he said 
but rep george gekas of pennsylvania ranking republican on the 
panel countered that never has there been a hint that any 
part of this inquiry was based on racial motivations he offered 
hastings assurances that the panel would be unmotivated by 
anything but the search for truth

japan and west germany have replaced the 
united states as top traders with south africa according to a 
study from the general accounting office 
the gao which conducts investigations for congress reports a 
small increase in us lending to south africa early last year 
the office says that in recent years south africa has stopped 
publishing details of its foreign trade and that older figures may 
not be accurate because of a long history of sanctions sanctions 
both official and private have been imposed on south africa from 
abroad because of its race policies 
the gao put together figures for sen edward m kennedy 
dmass and lowell p weicker jr rconn using other sources 
including the us government the international monetary fund and 
private organizations 
the report dated april 29 was made available to the media this 
week it gives percentages rather than actual dollar values for 
trade 
it shows that west germany took the place of the united states 
as south africas leading supplier in 1984 providing 204 percent 
of south africas imports to 197 percent for the united states by 
the first six months of 1987 the german proportion had risen to 
254 percent japans to 18 percent britains to 158 the united 
states was in fourth place with 134 percent 
the united states continued as south africas best customer 
until the first half of 1987 the latest period for which the study 
has figures but in those six months japan bought 238 percent of 
south africas exports with italy taking 174 percent and the 
united states 126 percent 
according to the report there are conflicting views and little 
evidence about south african efforts to avoid sanctions although 
world trade increased substantially in the five years covered 
south africas trade with 24 major countries decreased 
comparing the first half of each year from 1982 through 1987 it 
finds that south african exports dropped to 52 billion from 56 
billion imports by south africa decreased to 44 billion from 
64 billion 
an economist and us embassy personnel in south africa state 
that south africa has no need to extensively use sanctionbusting 
activities because the sanctions have not had a substantially 
adverse effect on the economy the report says 
it quotes the shipping research bureau a private organization 
as saying that despite embargoes south africa can still get most 
of the oil it needs at a higher price 
according to the bureau most of south africas oil comes from 
persian gulf countries that sell the oil to independent oil 
traders who disguise by false documentation that the oil is being 
shipped to south africa it adds 
the bureau said it had notified these oil producing countries 
that the independent traders they are dealing with ship some of 
their oil to south africa but the countries continue to deal with 
south africa 
on lending to south africa the report uses information from the 
californianevada interfaith council on corporate responsibility 
it reports that international lending including us lending to 
south africa had declined at the end of 1986 
of a total 226 billion borrowed by south africa banks in 
britain accounted for 36 billion those in the united states for 
3 billion west germany for 19 billion and switzerland for 18 
billion 
us lending increased marginally in the first six months of 
1987 to just over 3 billion the report says without giving 
precise figures 
in the light of the ban on most forms of new us lending that 
took effect in midnovember 1986 we have not been able to explain 
this small increase the report says 
new us investment in south african longterm securities has 
decreased since 1985 36 million worth in 1986 and 13 million 
last year despite an increase of 7 million in purchases by 
americans of south african bonds 
the number of us companies withdrawing from south africa rose 
from 40 in 1985 to 55 in 1987 in the first four months of this 
year there were only four withdrawals however these figures came 
from the us investor responsibility research center a private 
group

the environmental protection agency should 
back away from its attempt to strip north carolina of the right to 
operate its own hazardous waste disposal program according to a 
recommendation to epas administrator 
the use of program withdrawal authorities under federal 
hazardous waste law is not the most effective means to make sure 
waste facilities are soundly operated said j winston porter 
assistant administrator for solid waste and emergency response in 
a letter to administrator lee m thomas 
porters letter was dated monday and obtained wednesday by the 
associated press 
this is good news said velma smith of the environmental 
policy institute a washingtonbased lobbying organization for 
environmental causes that had been supporting north carolina you 
have made my day 
porter said epa should use its authority under the superfund 
waste dump cleanup law as the primary vehicle for addressing 
capacity issues 
a 1986 amendment to the superfund law requires states to show 
that they have plans for handling all the toxic waste they 
generate at the risk of losing state grants under the superfund 
program 
i would like for us to work cooperatively with the states to 
develop necessary waste management capacity and to make it clear 
that the required superfund capacity certification will be 
considered very seriously by epa porter wrote 
porters letter reported findings of a special agency committee 
considering the dispute with north carolina together with porters 
own recommendations the task force has not yet reached a 
consensus recommendation but should do so within two weeks he 
said 
the north carolina dispute arose when gsx corp sought to put a 
waste treatment plant on the lumber river upstream of lumberton 
whose 10000 citizens get their drinking water from the stream 
state law requires that any stream used for drinking water and 
receiving discharge from such a plant dilute the discharge by a 
factor of 1000 
compliance would limit the plant to discharing 72000 gallons a 
day at the planned location it had planned to discharge 500000 
epa officials contended the state law in effect limited capacity 
in such a way as to prevent other states from using the plant and 
in effect to keep the plant from being built at all some officials 
were reported as saying the agency wanted in effect to make an 
example of north carolina to warn other states against letting 
parochial concerns hamper interstate commerce 
state officials denied it and ms smith said north carolinas 
law would permit a plant of unlimited size 30 miles downstream 
an epa administrative law judge had been scheduled to hear the 
agencys attempt to revoke north carolinas authority next month 
federal hazardous waste law encourages states to operate their 
own disposal programs under epa oversight state programs must be 
consistent with federal law and may be more stringent 
one of the findings of the task force reported by porter was 
that it will be increasingly difficult for epa to determine the 
difference between a states consistency with the national 
waste programs and the states ability to be more stringent 
than the national program

washington jesse jacksons campaign on wednesday fired a salvo 
in his bid to change what he considers the democratic partys 
unfair system of delegate selection writing to party chief paul 
kirk that the vote of the people is distorted by the current 
process 
a letter signed by jacksons campaign chief willie brown and 
jackson adviser rep walter fauntroy of washington urged kirk to 
consider the moral and political questions raised in an 
attached delegate analysis compiled by jacksons delegate counter 
steve cobble 
the letter was dated may 17 and copies were sent to democratic 
frontrunner michael dukakis who has benefitted from the system 
jackson is protesting and to house speaker jim wright of texas 
jackson principally objects to the role of the socalled super 
delegates who are delegates by virtue of their elected offices of 
party positions because their allegiance is not related to the 
popular vote most of them have been siding with dukakis 
brown and other jackson representatives have met with kirk to 
urge a more proportional system of allocating super delegates but 
have not decided whether to mount an official challenge at the 
summer nominating convention in atlanta aides have said 
as of now it is an appeal to conscience and to fairness 
said ron brown who is heading jacksons convention team he said 
all options are open on the matter of an official challenge 
but also said there are no plans to call for retroactive changes in 
the party rules 
dukakis said wednesday in boston that he does not anticipate a 
fight with mr jackson 
i think jesse has a perfect right to voice criticism of 
whatever he chooses to criticize he said before repeating his 
position that jackson knew the delegate selection rules when he 
entered the race 
the cobble analysis said dukakis has 61 percent more delegates 
than jackson in early may at a time that the two were separated by 
a a popular vote margin of less than 30 percent according to 
counts by news organizations 
cobble cited four reasons for the inequity 
in puerto rico jackson won the nonbinding popular vote but in 
an internal political power war the puerto rico governor awareded 
all the islands 51 delegates to dukakis 
super delegates have flocked to dukakis rather than dividing 
themselves up in a way that would more accurately reflect the 
popular vote 
the super delegates do not have to coronate a winner they 
could act on behalf of fairness there is nothing in the rules 
which mandates a lemminglike rush to the frontrunners side 
particularly when he is in reality so far short of 2081 votes 
the number needed to secure the democratic presidential nomination 
the letter said 
the cover letter from willie brown and fauntroy states the 
party of fairness is not well serviced in the candidate receiving 
30 percent of the 1988 primary and caucus vote is virtually 
excluded from the support of super delegates the democratic party 
is not well served if the vote of the people is distorted once the 
polls are closed 
direct election states in which voters elect delegates on the 
ballot rather than having the delegates awarded proportionately 
based on how a candidate did in each district have worked against 
jackson in maryland according to cobbles memo jackson would 
have received 26 delegates under a proportional representation 
system but in the direct election he got 20 similar inequities 
were evidenced in the direct election states of illinois and 
pennsylvania he wrote 
the use of bonus elections in some states has worked to 
dukakis advantage and jacksons disadvantage in those states the 
first delegate in each district is awarded to the person who won 
the district those states have cost jackson some 22 to 27 
delegates while dukakis gained 20 to 25 the letter said 
if all of the jackson objections were fixed according to 
cobble dukakis delegate lead of 562 on may 6 would have dropped 
to a lead of 260 
that would have put dukakis in a different situation than the 
coronation that is taking place today he wrote

a bristol laboratories spokesman said 
wednesday that the voluntary recall of certain batches of the 
cholesterollowering drug questran does not apply to supplies 
already in patients hands 
the company announced the recall after it learned that one of 
the ingredients in the drug may have been contaminated by 
agricultural chemicals 
scott litherland a spokesman for bristol laboratories said the 
low levels of these chemicals present in some batches of the drug 
did not pose a health threat and that patients should continue 
taking the medication 
litherland said the recall only involves certain questran 
supplies at the wholesale and retail level but not medication that 
has already been sold to consumers 
the voluntary recall involves cans and packets of questran

the energy department should be required to 
justify in public its need to produce nuclear weapons material a 
coalition of community groups said wednesday 
citizens in this country should be able to go through the 
accounting to see whether its worth it said tim connor 
spokesman for one group the hanford education action league of 
spokane wash 
the public accounting proposition headed a list of eight 
principles backed by connors group and 13 others as a bill of 
rights that should govern efforts to clean up doe weapons plants 
though the coalition includes some groups that ordinarily oppose 
nuclear weapons connor said this is not a banthebomb 
statement 
to illustrate the diversity of views represented in the 
coalition connor said there is a good case to be made in my 
view for a new production reactor for tritium production 
in july the department is expected to propose development of a 
new reactor to produce tritium for weapons tritium decays in 
storage and must be refreshed in stockpiled weapons 
the sole active tritium reactor at the savannah river plant in 
south carolina is operating at half power because of safety 
concerns 
the department has conceded that the nation is awash in 
plutonium the other weapons material from previous production and 
recycling of old weapons it is putting a plutonium reactor at the 
hanford nuclear reservation in washington state on standby 
connor appeared at a news conference sponsored by the 
environmental policy institute a washingtonbased lobbying 
organization for environmentalist causes another speaker lisa 
crawford of fernald residents for safety and health said we 
have never once said shut the facility down we have said clean it 
up and operate it safely 
her group concerns itself with the departments plant in 
fernald ohio 
the other points in the coalitions bill of rights called 
for independent licensing of new plants and indepedent safety 
regulation public participation in licensing ending of current 
exemptions and compliance with all federal and state environmental 
laws a federal commitment to pay all cleanup costs longterm 
health studies of nearby residents job retraining for displaced 
workers when plants close and a pledge that production decisions 
will not be made for porkbarrel purposes 
many of these points are addressed in bills in congress but the 
coalition is not supporting a specific bill bits and pieces of 
each deserve support connor said 
the house has approved a provision for a safety oversight board 
within the energy department and spokesman will callicott said the 
department was not opposing it he would not comment on the call 
for public accounting 
other groups participating wednesday were greenpeace american 
friends service committee puget sound sane seattle palouse 
clearwater hanford watch moscow idaho ohio public interest

the secret service in keeping with its name 
doesnt like to discuss the details or frequency of threats against 
jesse jackson michael dukakis or george bush neither do the 
candidates and their staffs 
yet the specter of the candidate as a crackpots target is a 
fact of politics in america and as a charismatic candidate and a 
black man with a groundbreaking presidential candidacy jackson 
has become a magnet for death threats 
just like the kennedys have had to wrestle long and hard with 
running for president because of the risk i have had to do the 
same thing jackson once said 
by his own count jackson was the object of 314 recorded threats 
on his life during his 1984 presidential campaign in 14 of those 
cases people were arrested 
jacksons campaign press secretary delmarie cobb said the 
secret service would not give the number of threats against him for 
this campaign she said early wednesday she had understood from 
another staff member that there were at least 100 but later said 
she could not confirm the figure and that the secret service had 
subsequently told her the number was wrong 
cobb quoted jackson as saying that threats against him in 1984 
were more numerous than for any candidate and that of course 
theyre running high now 
federal agents in st louis said this week they had arrested a 
selfdescribed white supremacist and his wife on charges of 
conspiring to kill or harm jackson londell williams 30 of 
washington mo and his wife tammy 26 were being held without 
bond 
authorities recovered a semiautomatic rifle said to belong to 
the couple an agent quoted williams as saying jackson was 
getting too close to being president of the united states 
jackson in california thanked the secret service on wednesday 
and said we will not surrender to the dreambusters 
dukakis who for a long time spurned secret service protection 
praised the agency as well and acknowledged the threats he has 
received 
all of us in public life have these threats dukakis said 
ive had them not recently to the best of my knowledge these 
things happen to you 
the secret service has been protecting most major presidential 
candidates since ordered by congress following the assassination of 
robert f kennedy in 1968 on the night he won californias 
democratic primary 
secret service spokesman william j corbett said it is against 
agency policy to discuss the protection accorded any of the 
candidates the methods that are used or the nature of threats 
the more hype we put on it the more potential there is to 
plant the seed in other peoples mind he said we go out of 
our way to downplay it 
he said the secret service works closely with other federal 
agencies and with state and local police to monitor any potential 
threats including the possible threat posed by terrorists 
overseas while only a few threats result in arrests all are 
viewed with seriousness and are pursued he said 
some of them fizzle out luckily and others dont and we 
keep monitoring to see what the potential is corbett said 
the crowded 1988 presidential field which earlier boasted more 
than a dozen major party candidates forced the secret service to 
borrow agents from other treasury department agencies customs 
internal revenue service and the bureau of alcohol tobacco and 
firearms 
dukakis did not accept agents until last week preferring the 
freedom of movement and ability to circulate with crowds he 
resisted the urgings of some on his staff and even his wife kitty 
to accept protection sooner 
i think dukakis felt he wanted to run as close a campaign as 
he could to the voters and felt comfortable with the kind of 
support he was getting form local police as he traveled said 
leslie dach dukakis communications director 
he tries to live as much of a private life as he can and in 
order for the service to do their job it takes a bit away from 
that dukakis likes to be able to go home and be by himself and 
enjoy his neighborhood and i think that was a large part of it 
dach said 
other candidates particularly those struggling early in the 
race welcomed the protection it meant a traveling entourage of 
agents as few as four or as many as nine or 10 it lends an air of 
professionalism to a campaign and it helps to pay for the 
airplane as former democratic candidate sen albert gore jr 
once quipped 
the government pays for each agents seat on a candidates 
chartered plane 
but the seriousness of the duty is often apparent 
during the new york primary campaign agents remained extremely 
close to jackson at all times one agent confided he would be 
greatly relieved when the campaign left the state 
as with the president the thought that some violent act could 
erupt at any moment is always present with a presidential candidate 
and his entourage 
my mother tells me not to stand too close to jackson his 
spokeswoman cobb said adding that it was meant in a somewhat 
joking way 
you have to basically believe that nothings going to 
happen she said you cant operate in fear 
there are certain givens i must face every day jackson told 
the atlanta constitution in an interview anxiety and fear can 
become paralyzing i cannot let myself become paralyzed with morbid 
thoughts

secretary of state george p shultz who hates 
smoking so much he outlawed it on his official flights accepted 
gifts of silver cigarette boxes from leaders in india france 
guatemala and mexico last year according to a list issued 
wednesday 
the secretary also kept caviar chocolates a tea set and a 
lacquered painting worth 175 in all from soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev 
the gifts were on shultzs annual financial disclosure 
statement which gives a barebones outline of assets and income 
plus his 99030 salary as a cabinet officer 
a blind trust established for shultz when he took office july 
1982 generated more than 100000 in income in 1987 how much more 
he is not required to disclose under the rules of the office of 
government ethics the trust executed purchases and sales totaling 
more than 250000 during the year 
for most of his adult life shultz has been either a college 
professor or government official but during the ford and carter 
presidencies and in the beginning of president reagans first term 
he was a highranking executive of the bechtel group inc one of 
the worlds largest construction companies 
all gifts from foreigners worth more than 100 must be reported 
and anything over 180 must be turned in to the government 
besides all those cigarette boxes shultz kept six pounds of 
coffee from kenyan president daniel arap moi four yards of silk 
from the wife of the south korean ambassador and a danish ham from 
the danish foreign minister 
the royal canadian mounted police sent shultz a wall mounting 
titled mounties 
shultz kept more gifts from soviet foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze than from any other single source which was not 
surprising considering the number of times they met during a year 
of superpower summitry 
the gifts included a book on russian churches a candle holder 
with some sort of semiprecious stone adornment a small pill 
box two other boxes a commemorative medal vodka dolls a 
lacquered picture and a soapstone necklace the report said 
many leaders gave shultz books israeli foreign minister shimon 
peres sent a tome titled the jewish people 4000 years of 
survival and salvadoran president jose napoleon duarte gave his 
autobiography my story 
the costliest gifts shultz accepted from american sources in 
1987 were 633 in tennis clothes and equipment from the community 
foundation of greater washington which runs a charityraising 
celebrity tennis tournament shultz plays in 
shultz certified that the statements in the form were true 
complete and correct to the best of my knowledge and belief but 
whoever filled in the secretarys telephone number in the heading 
got it wrong 
the state department changed the numbers on most of its phones 
in 1986 and shultzs form signed may 4 1988 had the old digits 
any member of the public who sees the form and calls shultz at the 
number on the form will hear a recording that says you have 
reached a disconnected us government number

recent attacks on the electric 
power grid by leftist rebels have put seven of the 19 distribution 
lines out of service and aggravated supply problems created by 
drought officials said wednesday 
orlando quiteno public relations director of the staterun 
lempa river hydrolectric executive commission said in a telephone 
interview about 40 percent of the nation has been affected by the 
sabotage 
government reports show 75 percent of san salvador and five of 
the 14 provinces have been without service since monday an 
emergency rationing system already in effect has been tightened 
elsewhere 
guerrillas of the farabundo marti national liberation front who 
began fighting ussupported governments 8 years ago said 
tuesday they had mobilized dozens of units of militia and 
saboteurs throughout the national territory 
a broadcast by clandestine radio venceremos said the campaign 
was placing the christian democratic military dictatorship in the 
worst energy crisis of the war 
col mauricio vargas operations director for the joint chiefs 
of staff told reporters the military command was studying ways to 
increase security for the nearly 500 miles of primary cables in the 
distribution system 
the power grid has been a prime target in the guerrila program 
of economic sabotage official reports say more than 2000 attacks 
since 1980 have done at least 51 million in damage 
quiteno said that before the latest attacks the power company 
had begun a rotating system of daily fourhour power cuts because 
of low water levels in reservoirs and a delay in the arrival of the 
rainy season which normally begins in may 
an attack may 11 on the november 5th dam in northern el salvador 
forced daily cuts of six to eight hours he said 
raiders destroyed five transformers and a central control board 
at the dam 50 miles north of san salvador reports indicate the 
generating facility will be down for two months and damage exceeds 
500000

jewish leaders said tuesday there are signs in italy 
of the same antisemitism that preceded enactment of racial laws 50 
years ago by benito mussolinis fascist government 
chief rabbi elio toaff and jacob sabban president of the jewish 
community told reporters it could be the prelude of things much 
more vile and not only against the jews 
toaff and sabban accused the media of publishing reports from 
the middle east that compare israelis to nazis because of the 
israelis policies toward palestinians in the occupied territories 
they displayed bundles of threatening letters and dozens of photos 
of swastikas painted on walls in rome 
they said an old man who survived auschwitz was asked by a 
doctor who saw the camp number tattooed on his arm how many 
palestinians have you killed today in your extermination camps 
a jewish university student was forced to remove the star of 
david he wore on a chain around his neck the two men said 
it seems to me the return of the climate that preceded 50 
years ago the approval of the racial laws by the fascist regime 
toaff declared 
both said a deterioration of the value of civilization was 
illustrated by recent acts of intolerance against gypsies and 
people of other races 
toaff said criticism of israel is legitimate but journalists 
should be careful not to use terminology that encourages 
antisemitism he said threats to the jewish community made 
recently had the pretext of condemning acts by israel

his program two weeks before a coup attempt which the government 
has blamed on a group of civilians and military officers

rebellion in connection with the coup attempt last week

a government investigating commission 
concluded wednesday that two sports organizations were remiss in 
the stadium stampede that killed more than 70 fans at a soccer 
match in katmandu on march 12 
many in the crowd that day accused officials of failing to open 
locked stadium doors and of failing to control the crowd when a 
sudden hailstorm caused spectators to panic 
the commission report listed the hailstorm as the main cause of 
the stampede but said the allnepal football soccer association 
and the national sports council failed to handle the incident 
properly 
the commission said preparations by the football association 
organizers of the match for exit routes from the downtown national 
stadium were not found to be satisfactory 
it said the sports council failed to keep stadium gates in a 
proper state during the match and that sports council security 
personnel failed to take appropriate actions during the emergency 
the stadium was nearly filled to capacity for the final game in 
a series between a national cigarette factory team and a squad from 
bangladesh 
spectators raced toward locked exit doors when the hailstorm 
burst with more than 70 people killed and about 100 injured in the 
stampede 
most of the dead were crushed or trampled others were 
suffocated

the army apparently violated utah law by 
conducting openair tests of new chemical weapon simulants last 
year without first obtaining air pollution permits state officials 
say 
a spokeswoman for dugway proving ground denied any laws were 
broken saying the army believed that stateapproved variances 
allowing use of smokecausing chemicals would also permit testing 
of the new chemical arms 
records show the army conducted up to 57 openair tests last 
year of the new bigeye and multiple launch rocket system weapons at 
dugway the weapons were filled with what the army says are 
harmless chemicals that safely simulate the characteristics of 
deadly nerve gas 
but burnell cordner director of the state air quality bureau 
said openair use of those chemical simulants has never been 
approved by the state although other types of smokecausing 
chemicals have 
they should have a permit if they emit things in the air that 
we classify as a pollutant and thats fairly broad it may be that 
for various reasons they may have fit some exclusion and did not 
need a permit but they should have checked with us first to find 
out he said 
cordner said penalties of up to 10000 a day for each violation 
are possible under state law while the state may not pursue 
penalties it does want to know how many tests the army conducted 
without permits and what chemicals it used he said 
dugway spokeswoman kathleen whitaker said the army thought its 
tests were allowed under an extension of a variance that the state 
gave last year for certain tests but she acknowledged that the 
army failed to provide the state a list of all pollutants it was 
using by a feb 1 deadline 
she said although the army did not specifically notify the state 
about the chemicals used in the tests it did list them in a legal 
notice in salt lake newspapers some of the chemicals also were 
listed in an army request last week to the utah air conservation 
committee for variances to allow future tests 
the committee temporarily refused to grant variances for many of 
the chemicals because officials knew little or nothing about them 
and because officials were upset that some compounds had been 
tested without permission 
david thurman of the utah bureau of epidemiology was asked by 
the committee to study the chemicals on the armys new list and 
report on their characteristics thurman said he is not familiar 
with most of the chemicals yet and said that most are not commonly 
used in industry 
brian killgallin spokesman at aberdeen proving ground md 
said the chemicals included diethyl malonate bis bis2ethyl 
hexyl phosphonate and tip triisopropyl phosphanite 
killgallin said diethyl malonate is used as a food flavoring 
agent and also in the manufacture of barbiturates but is not 
considered hazardous he said bis and tip are both lubricant 
additives bis is not considered hazardous and tip has been 
qualified as hazardous only because of its ignitability he said

the son of rudolf hess called wednesday for a new 
investigation into the death last year of the hitler deputy 
contending he was murdered at a berlin prison a news agency 
reported 
there is no substance in the allegation that prisoner no 7 
rudolf hess committed suicide in allied hands in spandau prison on 
17 august 1987 wolf ruediger hess and a british surgeon said 
in a statement quoted by the british news agency press association 
on the contrary there is overwhelming evidence that murder 
was committed not one vestige of evidence supports the contention 
of suicide the statement said 
it charged that british officials covered up evidence 
surrounding hess death at age 93 
officials concluded hess strangled himself with an electric cord 
the surgeon hugh thomas examined the prisoner in spandau in 
1973 while working as a british army doctor thomas reiterates in a 
book to be published thursday his contention that it was an 
imposter who died last year in berlin and that hess was murdered in 
1941 
hess family believes that the prisoner held by the world war ii 
allies in spandau in the british sector of west berlin was 
actually hess but rejects the official verdict that he committed 
suicide 
thomas says hess was murdered while flying to scotland on a 
peace mission in 1941 and claims a man in a second plane was 
arrested by authorities who thought he was hess 
that man was murdered last year to prevent the leak of details 
of a world war ii plot by powerful britons to overthrow prime 
minister winston churchill thomas writes in his book a tale of 
two murders 
thomas said in the book that the release of the man would have 
led to open questioning about hess and his highlevel contacts 
in britain 
the reason for the murder is the continued protection of 
persons in the hierarchy whose reputations would suffer as a 
consequence of wholesale treason in which they would be revealed 
he said 
thomas has long claimed that the imprisoned man was not hess he 
first made the assertion in his 1979 book the murder of rudolph 
hess 
thomas says two autopsies carried out on the prisoner support 
his contention that the man did not bear scars of a severe chest 
wound hess suffered in world war i 
at the time of the parachute arrival in scotland of the man 
claiming to be hess there was concern about his identity he had a 
farfetched plan for a separate peace between britain and germany 
and an alliance against the soviet union which at that point had 
not been attacked by hitler 
hess was tried at nuremburg in 1946 convicted of war crimes and 
sent to spandau where he was guarded by french soviet british and 
us troops 
the statement by thomas and the younger hess said that hess 
suicide note was fake it claims exhibits put together during the 
investigation of the death were interfered with or destroyed by the 
british

a manhattan welfare hotel has been accused of 
forcing families of three to live in 9by12 foot spaces without 
bathrooms tables or chairs while collecting 1230 a month rent 
from the city 
legal aid attorneys who represent many of the martinique 
hotels 455 families said that as many as 80 rooms have been 
illegally subdivided 
city officials however said the rooms do meet state standards 
and have not been illegally divided one of the hotels owners also 
denied the legal aid claims 
suzanne trazoff a spokeswoman for the city human resources 
administration said owners are not making more money by 
subdividing since they are paid by the person and two families of 
three are now living where a family of six would once have been put 
for new york city to decide that smaller families dont need 
privacy is clearly a surprise to me and a violation of state 
regulation said state state social services commissioner cesar 
perales after hearing the legal aid attorneys claims my 
regulations clearly apply to all families 
perales ordered an inspection thursday and said the city would 
be ordered not to put any families in substandard rooms 
the subdivided rooms are barely large enough to contain a 
dresser and beds and legal aid attorney steven banks said they 
lack bathrooms and furniture necessary for daily living like 
tables and chairs to eat and do homework on 
salvatore tuccelli who identified himself as one of the owners 
of the hotel angrily denied the charges 
tuccelli said the martinique had begun using some of the hotels 
57 tworoom suites to house two small families each rather than one 
large one but denied that the hotel had illegally subdivided any 
rooms or housed anyone in cubicles 
there were no walls built there were no divisions of 
anything he said if you dont believe me you can call the 
buildings department 
a spokesman for the buildings department vahe tiryakian 
confirmed tuccellis contention 
we inspected several of the rooms in the hotel martinique 
he said our inspector found absolutely no alteration work that 
changed the size of the rooms they are in some of the setups 
sharing the bathroom but that is not disallowed by the building 
code theres nothing illegal about that 
perales has said however that state regulations require a 
private bathroom 
tuccelli said the rooms in the tworoom suites varied in size 
and that some of them ranged from 130 square feet to 180 square 
feet he said he didnt know if any were smaller a 9by12foot 
room would contain 108 square feet 
he also denied that the rooms were barren of furniture 
whatever they need we give them he said 
ms trazoff acknowledged that conditions in the hotel were less 
than ideal but said the state knows the city is trying to change 
the situation 
our first obligation is to provide a bed to every family 
nobody has ever said hotels are a longterm answer ms trazoff 
said 
ms trazoff said the city is aware the hotel has been dividing 
tworoom suites but said it was to accommodate smaller families 
she said there used to be many families of six or more but most 
families there now are smaller 
theyre getting the same money as they did when they housed a 
family of six in one room as they do housing two families of three 
in two rooms she said 
the city pays 17 a day for the first person and 12 for each 
additional person per room the monthly cost for a family of three 
is 1230 in welfare cases the federal government reimburses the 
city for 50 percent of that cost while the state takes care of 25 
percent 
last year perales ordered the city to stop using one 
cockroachinfested room in the martinique it had no tables and 
chairs and the family of three shared a bathroom with another woman 
and her four children 
that was the first time new york state had ordered the city to 
move a family out of a welfare room the state said the 
martinique fails to even minimally conform to the standards set 
forth in department regulations 
perales said the legal aid society sent his office a letter 
saying other rooms at the martinique had similar violations 
including putting families of three in 9by12 rooms 
we require that when a local welfare department puts up a 
family in a hotel or motel anywhere in the state that they be given 
a private bathroom and other necessities like tables and 
chairs perales said he said his staff would inspect the 
martinique on thursday 
the city recently announced a plan in which it hopes to have 
homeless families out of all welfare hotels in five years it 
currently houses 5189 homeless families of which 3437 are in 
hotels and the rest in shelters

a federal appeals court wednesday reinstated 62 
cases against boat operators fined for bringing cubans to the 
united states in the 1980 mariel boatlift 
the cases were among 900 pursued by the immigration and 
naturalization service following the boatlift which brought 
125000 refugees from the cuban port of mariel to florida 
the ins fined the boat owners and operators 1000 for each 
cuban brought to the united states and then filed about 900 
lawsuits against those who failed to pay the fines the lawsuits 
were divided among the judges in the southern disstrict of florida 
us district judge alcee l hastings of miami dismissed all 62 
cases assigned to his court saying the ins had failed to state its 
case correctly the 11th us circuit court of appeals wednesday 
threw out hastings ruling saying the cases had been stated 
sufficiently 
hastings is facing impeachment since fellow judges brought 
unrelated misconduct allegations after his acquittal on bribery 
conspiracy charges five years ago he had hearings wednesday before 
a house judiciary subcommittee in which he demanded dismissal of 
the allegations 
during the lengthy appeals of hastings action on the boatlift 
hastings had rejected attempts by the government to get the cases 
sent back to the ins for reconsideration 
the government asked the appeals court to send all 62 cases to 
the ins but the court sent some cases back to the district court 
and remanded others to the ins the court ruled wednesday the cases 
could not be treated the same because the records before the court 
for some cases were incomplete 
the court also noted that some of the defendants had not been 
served properly with the lawsuits its order gave the government 
120 days to serve those defendants with the proper papers

a senate subcommittee report is seriously 
wrong in accusing attorney general edwin meese iii of violating a 
white house policy by assisting scandalplagued wedtech corp 
meeses private lawyers said wednesday 
in addition meeses counselor at the justice department 
william bradford reynolds claimed subcommittee chairman carl 
levin dmich did not give subcommittee members an opportunity to 
vote on the report 
the subcommittee report was issued following standard 
committee procedures the report was circulated to every member of 
the subcommittee for comment release of the report was 
approved by the subcommittee members said levin in a response 
statement 
the report issued earlier this month says thenwhite house 
counselor meese and his deputy violated a white house policy 
barring contacts with procurement officials resulting in 
favoritism toward wedtech 
wedtech in september 1982 got a 32 million nobid federal 
contract to build small engines for the army after an intense 
lobbying campaign by former white house political director lyn 
nofziger and longtime meese friend e robert wallach 
meeses private attorneys nathan lewin and james rocap said 
the subcommittee report was incorrect because the white house 
policy permits contacts with procurement agencies when the white 
house has a legitimate interest in information about procurement 
matters 
mr meeses direction to his staff to ensure that welbilt 
which was then the firms name received fair treatment was 
consistent with that widely recognized interest and was permitted 
under the white house policy lewin and rocaps said in an 
18page rebuttal 
president reagan had campaigned in the south bronx ny area 
where wedtech was located and had expressed an interest in 
promoting jobs to the area 
the report appears to us to be seriously wrong in its 
finding lewin and rocap concluded 
in a cover letter with the rebuttal sent to levin reynolds said 
he understood that members of levins subcommittee on oversight of 
government management were not provided an opportunity to vote on 
the panels report 
however the panels five democrats or four republicans were 
given an opportunity to file dissenting views and none did

ethnic minorities will be guaranteed seats in 
parliament under legislation passed wednesday that changes the 
election rules 
goh chok first deputy prime minister said minority groups 
welcomed the change and had said so at public hearings all 
agreed that a multiracial parliament is essential to political 
stability he said 
parliament approved two bills wednesday that amend the 
constitution and revise polling laws to institutionalize 
multiracial politics in this island republic of 26 million people 
more than 76 percent are ethnic chinese malays make up 15 
percent indians 6 percent and the rest are eurasians and others 
the official languages are mandarin english malay and tamil 
prime minister lee kuan yew who first suggested racial 
guarantees in 1982 told the hearings in march that race was a 
constant factor in singapore and chauvinism persisted he said he 
was trying to anticipate problems instead of reacting 
lee said his peoples action party which holds all but one seat 
in parliament had trouble finding candidates in the malay 
community which lags behind other ethnic groups in social 
economic and educational progress 
about 85 percent of singapores people live in governmentbuilt 
apartments and deliberate dispersal of races in the projects has 
prevented concentrations of malay voters who might elect their own 
candidates 
the measures were approved in the 79member parliament by votes 
of 670 with no abstentions and the only opposition member absent 
they provide for group represention constituencies with 
three seats each at least one of which must be filled by a person 
who is malay or from another minority 
lees party has controlled parliament since 1959 the fragmented 
opposition is given little chance of ousting it in the general 
election that must be held by december 1989 
the last parliamentary vote four years ago elected 63 chinese

portland mayor bud clark is heading for a 
november runoff after falling just short of the number of votes 
necessary to win a second fouryear term outright 
writein votes and about 6500 absentee ballots remained to be 
counted but clark said wednesday that it was unlikely he would 
pick up enough votes to avoid a runoff against a former police 
chief ron still 
it looks like were going to have to do it clark said 
its just frustrating to me he said all i want is the 
job and to get the job done 
clark needed one vote more than 50 percent of the total votes 
cast in the nonpartisan election tuesday to win reelection 
outright but final unofficial results showed he had 4992 percent 
also in oregon voters statewide approved by a 2to1 margin a 
law requiring drivers and passengers of motorcycles and mopeds to 
wear helmets 
and in colorado voters in a denver suburban area approved a 
plan to let the city annex land for a new 3 billion airport that 
would be the first major us airport since 1974 and ease 
congestion at the existing airport 
clark with 59981 votes was followed by still with 40352 or 
336 percent and former city commissioner lloyd anderson with 
12733 or 106 percent former police chief jim davis was a 
distant fourth with 4848 or 4 percent the remaining seven 
candidates split 2251 votes or just under 2 percent 
charles duffy clarks press secretary said the absentee 
ballots would be counted thursday and friday the mayor fell about 
170 votes short of avoiding a runoff in the final unofficial 
tally duffy said 
clark a tavern owner scored a stunning victory four years ago 
over incumbent frank ivancie and held a big lead in preelection 
polls in the nonpartisan race this year despite a series of crises 
that plagued the first half of his term 
asked how a runoff election would affect his ability to function 
as mayor clark said we have to limit the number of things that 
we have on our agenda anyway and this just adds one more item and 
takes energy out of my life but we have plans for the city going 
forward and the city is going to work 
still confident of a runoff was one of two police chiefs who 
resigned during clarks first two years in office clark also fired 
a third police chief davis 
clarks most famous and controversial appointee penny 
harrington resigned after 16 months as the first female police 
chief of a big us city her resignation came a day after a 
commission that clark appointed issued a report sharply criticizing 
her management and recommending her replacement 
portlands high crime rate was a major issue in the campaign 
still said clarks policies helped cause the problem but clark 
vowed to make fighting crime his top priority 
clark 57 has been criticized for his eccentricities but there 
were few campaign attacks on his personality his trademark 
whoop whoop cry is a staple of civic functions and the 
bicycling mayor has chronicled his political career with an 
everpresent camera 
in colorado on wednesday gov roy romer and denver mayor 
federico pena went to the barren site of what may become the 
nations largest airport and hailed tuesdays land annexation 
decision by adams county voters 
county residents approved the citys plan to annex the 
45squaremile site northeast of denver by a 56 percent to 44 
percent margin the move cleared a major hurdle for the city to 
build a replacement for crowded stapleton international airport

oil drillers have been told to tear down 
their equipment and get out of big cypress national preserve after 
conservation groups protested that exploration would damage the 
sensitive lands 
the preserve covers cypress swamp hardwood hammocks and grass 
prairie in southwest florida adjacent to the everglades national 
park 
the order issued last week by the us justice department 
resulted from a suit filed by the wilderness society the sierra 
club and five other environmental groups arguing that the federal 
government pushed for drilling despite unresolved environmental 
concerns 
shell western energy and petroleum a subsidiary of shell oil 
co began exploration this month inside the 570000acre preserve 
by drilling holes for seismic testing 
shell spokeswoman mary dokianos has said the government decision 
will put 100 employees out of work and 1 million worth of 
equipment will have to be dismantled 
the company will probably continue to apply for rights to 
explore for oil north of the preserve on land that will eventually 
become part of the preserve under legislation signed by president 
reagan last month ms dokianos said 
until the government actually buys the land the national park 
service cant regulate oil companies wanting to explore there 
but representatives of the sierra club say they will fight to 
keep shell from exploring in the expansion area too

the senate on wednesday overwhelmingly 
repelled the first attack by republican conservatives on the 
ussoviet mediumrange missile treaty 
the senate voted 916 to shelve a bid by sen jesse helms 
rnc to stop debate on the treaty on grounds that soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev was not duly authorized to sign it 
the senates rejection of that claim was the first test vote on 
the the intermediaterange nuclear forces or inf treaty the treaty 
would ban all us and soviet missiles with ranges of 300 to 3400 
miles 
gorbachevs signature was invalid helms claimed because he 
signed as general secretary of the communist party of the soviet 
union not as a duly authorized representative of the soviet state 
because he is only the head of a political party not an official 
member of the soviet government 
the attempt to derail senate consideration of the pact came 
after senators of both parties hailed the treaty as an important 
first step toward worldwide arms control and appealed for swift 
ratification before president reagans summit meeting with 
gorbachev in moscow the summit begins may 29 
but as debate got under way helms apparently beginning a long 
series of delaying tactics raised a point of order and claimed 
that the treaty was invalid because gorbachevs signature was on it 
the fact remains that this document now at the desk is not 
binding on the soviet union helms contended it is only an 
agreement between the president of the united states and the head 
of a foreign political party 
said sen steven symms ridaho if the time comes the soviets 
find it convenient to roll out the ss20s they may have hidden 
they can say the treaty was signed by an invalid signature of 
someone who had no business doing it 
but sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said it was clear from the circumstances when 
the treaty was signed last dec 8 that gorbachev had full 
authority to represent his nation 
it is clear that mr gorbachev and no one else in that 
delegation was the chief representative of the soviet union pell 
said 
treaty making is a matter of common sense and wise judgment 
said sen richard lugar rind chosen to lead the debate on the 
republican side of the aisle there is no substance whatsoever to 
the claim that the treaty was not legally signed 
helms bridled at suggestions that he was raising technical 
objections to the treaty for the sake of delay saying what is 
occurring is not dilatory but is instead and in fact deliberative 
those voting against tabling the helms point of order were 
helms symms and sens gordon humphrey rnh james mcclure 
ridaho larry pressler rsd and strom thurmond rsc 
not voting were sens joseph r biden ddel lawton chiles 
dfla and daniel patrick moynihan dny 
earlier a lengthy wrangle broke out of the kind that may make 
it impossible to meet the deadline of the summits opening may 29 
the issue how to assure that the commonly understood meaning of 
the treaty at the time it is ratified is binding and will not in 
the future be reinterpreted without the consent of the senate 
the controversy arises from the reagan administrations proposed 
reinterpretation of the 1972 antiballistic missile or abm treaty 
to permit the deployment of a star wars strategic defense system 
the issue is intensely partisan sen arlen specter rpa 
opposing an amendment to address the issue in the current treaty 
warned of a lengthy debate to defeat it and said it was a booby 
trap that could sink the whole ratification process 
it creates confusion and confrontation a turf battle 
extraordinaire in which the senate is seeking primacy in the 
treatymaking process 
specter contended that the administration seems to be having 
more trouble with the us senate than with the ussr he said 
but other senators said that if the senate does not address the 
issue on the missile treaty it would appear as if it has agreed to 
the doctrine that a treaty can be reinterpreted on grounds that 
what the senate was originally told about it did not represent the 
full truth 
if we do not do this the senates role in treaty making will 
be completely obliterated said sen paul sarbanes dmd 
the white house meanwhile stressed the importance of ratifying 
the treaty quickly 
white house chief of staff howard h baker said that ratifying 
the treaty before the may 29 summit would be a major plus while 
failure to do so might have some effect on the soviets 
willingness to go forward with the next treaty baker said 
it would not be a disaster but it would be a 
disappointment baker said i can visualize some soviet 
personality saying we the united states havent ratified any 
treaty since 1972 so whats the purpose of this 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas announced the 
appointment of lugar a former chairman of the foreign relations 
committee to manage the treaty debate for the gop 
that post normally would have gone to helms the senior 
republican on the foreign relations panel but helms is the most 
outspoken opponent of the pact vowing to vote against it even if 
he is the only senator to do so 
senate majority leader robert byrd dwva told reporters 
this treaty can be approved by the time the president leaves if 
we deal only with those serious legitimate amendments that ought 
to be dealt with on this issue 
but dole and byrd said they expect a number of amendments to be 
offered and cautioned that the pact could be delayed 
this treaty is an important symbol said sen brock adams 
dwash as the first full day of debate on the treaty opened 
to build on this important symbol it is absolutely necessary 
that we indicate to our nato allies that we believe in this treaty 
that we all stand together he said 
adams and several other senators described the pact as a 
building block toward agreement on a strategic arms reduction 
treaty which would cut longrange nuclear arms by up to 50 percent 
this is a window in time that might not repeat itself for 
several decades adams said there are significant groups in 
both the united states and the soviet union minorities in my 
opinion that dont trust and wont sign any agreement 
sen alan simpson rwyo the chambers deputy gop leader 
called the treaty a very small first step but a necessary one 
noting that in the years since world war ii the two superpowers 
never have been as close to actually cutting back their nuclear 
forces as they are now simpson told the senate 
after 44 years of talk finally there is a little dual point 
of convergence that is important to capture instead of talking 
the talk were finally walking the walk he said

confessed serial killer gerald stano who 
claims to have slain 41 women got an indefinite stay from a 
federal appeals court wednesday less than 24 hours before he was 
scheduled for execution 
attorneys for stano turned successfully to the 11th circuit 
court of appeals in atlanta after a federal judge here refused a 
stay of execution the district judge had rejected arguments that 
his defense counsel was ineffective 
the appeals court however ruled that stano was entitled to a 
hearing on the claim 
stano 36 who has been convicted of 10 murders was scheduled 
to die in floridas electric chair at 7 am thursday 
after hearing eight hours of legal arguments over two days us 
district judge patricia fawsett ruled wednesday that stanos lawyer 
had correctly informed him of the consequences of pleading guilty 
to the murders of two women but that stano rejected this 
advice 
i explained to mr stano that he was at risk that there were 
no deals and mr stano understood that the former lawyer 
howard pearl had testified 
in issuing the stay a threejudge panel of the 11th circuit 
ruled that it remained unclear whether stano understood what his 
lawyer meant when the attorney told stano he had not examined all 
the evidence 
carolyn snurkowski director of deathpenalty appeals in the 
office of attorney general bob butterworth said the state likely 
would not appeal the stay but she reserved final judgment until 
she had a chance to review the order 
we still have to look at it more carefully she said 
after giving him life sentences on guilty pleas in other cases 
volusia circuit judge james foxman sentenced stano to death in 1983 
in the killings of susan bickrest 24 in 1975 and cathy muldoon 
23 in 1977 
counsel followed the instructions of his client who had 
been found mentally competent by five experts fawsett said 
stano who was brought from death row to orlando for the 
district court hearing showed no emotion when fawsett issued her 
ruling he was relaxed and attentive and often smiled and joked 
with defense counsel 
the exact number of stanos victims may never be known said 
assistant attorney general belle turner with so many murders 
there has understandably been confusion over some cases and 
details she said 
although stano has been sentenced on only 10 of the crimes 
receiving seven life sentences and three death penalties florida 
investigators say they have documented 25 of the murders claimed by 
stano in this state and that there may have been others 
there is less known about the cases in the new 
jerseypennsylvania area which stano admitted to but authorities 
in those states have linked him to a number of unsolved murders 
over the years 
daytona beach police sgt paul crow the chief investigator who 
arrested stano in 1981 has testified that stano provided crucial 
information about burial sites victims clothing appearance 
methods of death and other minute details that only the killer 
would know 
he has been jailed since the 1981 arrest 
ann mcmillan of ocala a psychologist who has done extensive 
studies of stanos life says he fits into the classic pattern of 
multiple killers such as charles manson and david son of sam 
berkowitz 
in 1982 she estimated stanos death toll at 35 
stanos death warrant is his second for the bickrestmuldoon 
murders both women who worked as cocktail waitresses were forced 
into his car at gunpoint driven to remote areas and killed 
according to trial testimony 
besides the issues of inadequate defense counsel and of mental 
incompetency by stano olive accused police interrogators of 
misleading stano into a series of bogus confessions by 
promising that he would not receive the death penalty those 
arguments have been heard and rejected by various courts in the 
past 
all that happened here was that a guilty man pleaded guilty 
and was appropriately sentenced prosecutor turner argued

a judge has agreed to reopen 
the trial of the socalled sharpville six to hear defense 
arguments against the death sentences imposed on the black 
defendants court officials said wednesday 
the six five men and a woman were scheduled to hang march 18 
for complicity in the 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor in 
sharpeville south of johannesburg a stay of execution was granted 
march 17 
pretoria supreme court justice wj human set june 6 for a 
hearing on the case which has attracted international attention 
defense lawyers had applied to reopen the trial so they could 
present evidence that a key state witness was coerced into giving 
false testimony 
president pw botha has said he will not intervene in the case 
despite widespread appeals for clemency 
the case has sparked debate in part because the six were not 
convicted of contributing physically to the death of councilor 
jacob dlamini instead they were convicted under the doctrine of 
common purpose which held them responsible because they allegedly 
were active participants in the mob which set out to kill the 
councilor 
the killing occurred during riots provoked by a rent increase in 
sharpeville and neighboring townships

fbi agents arrested the former head of the 
collapsed sasson jeans empire wednesday for allegedly threatening 
the life of the federal bankruptcy judge handling his companys 
reorganization 
paul guez the majority shareholder in sasson jeans inc 
allegedly threatened the life of us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland who was presiding over the chapter 11 reorganization of the 
apparel licensor in manhattan 
according to a criminal complaint guez 43 threatened to kill 
lifland and other parties involved in the bankruptcy proceeding on 
monday if a result contrary to his interest were to be reached 
i did not threaten anybody i am astonished to see i have been 
accused of this guez told us magistrate barbara a lee during 
a marathon hearing in which prosecutors sought to have him detained 
without bail and guez sought his freedom in order to attend another 
bankruptcy hearing on thursday 
he claimed the charges were part of a conspiracy to block 
his attendance at the confirmation hearing on sassons 
reorganization plan 
ms lee ordered guez held overnight pending a detention hearing 
scheduled to take place before the afternoon bankruptcy hearing 
it wasnt the first time guez has gotten into hot water over his 
combative antics since taking over as his own lawyer in bankruptcy 
court 
lifland has cited guez twice for civil contempt and referred the 
matters to the district court level 
guez is also under indictment for allegedly assaulting a federal 
marshal over bankruptcy proceedings 
the criminal complaint said guez is currently undergoing 
psychiatric evaluation concerning his fitness to stand trial in 
the assault case 
the complaint was based on information supplied by a 
confidential informant described as a lawyer with a privileged 
professional relationship with guez 
the complaint further stated that due to the tone and 
demeanor of guez the informant believed he was fully capable 
of carrying out his threat 
sasson has been in bankruptcy proceedings since october 1986 on 
wednesday lifland approved the sale of the companys name for 8 
million to stanwich partners of stamford conn 
the tunisianborn guez arrived in this country in 1976 with 74 
and a new style of french cut jeans through clever advertising he 
took the market by storm and made millions by licensing the sasson 
label for watches lingerie and luggage as well as jeans 
but the company began to unravel due to internal feuds and 
sasson was swamped by lawsuits leading to the chapter 11 
reorganization

to emigrate from the soviet union this month continuing the upward 
trend of recent months

manhattan said he had learned of the increased emigration on 
tuesday when he met with president reagan secretary of state 
george shultz and soviet ambassador yuri dubinin

group of about 100 presidents things that looked impossible a 
year ago three years ago are now becoming reality

right to emigrate on national security grounds would now be allowed 
to leave

hospitals long accused of housing and maltreating dissidents 
would allow doctors from outside the country to examine their 
patients

the foreign correspondents 
association of the philippines said wednesday that allegations that 
foreign journalists financed a rebel ambush could hurt the 
countrys press freedom 
also wednesday a military official denied the british 
broadcasting corp was named as the foreign media group that 
reportedly paid new peoples army rebels to stage an ambush in 
february in which a generals son and 10 other soldiers were killed 
the correspondents group urged president corazon aquinos 
government to investigate the matter and make the results public 
quickly 
we fear that such unsubstantiated charges may constitute a 
potential assault on freedom of the press we believe that coverage 
of both sides of a guerrilla conflict is essential to responsible 
journalism the group said in a statement 
col marino filart deputy constabulary commander of bicol where 
the ambush occurred presented a captured rebel wednesday who said 
caucasian journalists gave her group a wad of 100peso 5 
bills and three m16 armalite rifles to stage the ambush for 
filming purposes 
filart said the woman did not identify the journalists involved 
he added that manila reporters may have concluded that it was the 
bbc because of a letter with the companys letterhead seized by the 
military from the rebels 
filart said the letter signed by a certain mina daum requested 
video coverage of rebels training but he added that we are not 
sure if the intent of the letter was pushed through 
his superior brig gen eduardo taduran was quoted by manila 
newspapers monday as saying that the letter showed the bbc was the 
group involved the military has provided no further evidence to 
substantiate the charges 
the bbc has denied the allegation and said it had no crew in the 
philippines when the ambush occurred 
rep gregorio andolana urged the philippine house of 
representatives wednesday to enact measures that would protect 
journalists right to cover events related to the insurgency the 
governmentrun news agency reported

journalists who maintain contact with rebel sources for their work

on tuesday brig gen alexander aguirre chief of the capital 
regional command said the military had seized rebel documents with 
the names of 112 foreign and philippine journalists who had been in 
touch with the guerillas since 1987 
aguirre said no legal action would be taken against the 
reporters but some would be placed under surveillance

pope john paul ii completed a south 
american tour wednesday by calling for a reconciled and brotherly 
paraguay but the ruling party blasted his meeting with opposition 
leaders calling them a grabbag of societys destroyers 
in a nighttime farewell address at asuncions airport the pope 
urged citizens to build the paraguay of tomorrow based on 
christian values 
i have happily witnessed the dream that moved you to launch in 
unity a reconciled and brotherly paraguay he said 
the countrys authoritarian president gen alfredo stroessner 
told the pope his visit was unforgettable 
stroessner widely regarded as a dictator described paraguay as 
pluralistic and democratic without violence without 
terrorism 
the pope departed in an alitalia boeing 747 for rome where he 
was to arrive thursday afternoon 
during his 12day trip the pope visited four nations uruguay 
bolivia peru and paraguay it was his ninth visit to the region 
earlier in the evening at a youth rally in a muddy field near 
the airport more than 100000 teenagers sang happy birthday 
to the pontiff in polish his native language it came at the end 
of a busy day that included visits to the parana river port city of 
encarnacion and caacupe site of the national catholic religious 
shrine 
during a mass in caacupe john paul ii repeated a call for 
special attention to the rights of the countrys largely landless 
peasants and indians 
todays church wants to strongly support their demands that 
their legitimate rights be respected without allowing them to 
forget their duties the pontiff said 
in encarnacion on the border with argentina john paul said 
paraguay suffers from a concept of life that puts profits and the 
thirst for power above the human person and his needs 
i call on you to construct a society of love said the pope 
john paul urged his audience to participate in a new 
evangelization he paid homage to the missionary priests who 
sowed the seed of catholicism among the native tribes of 
presentday paraguay argentina and brazil in the 16th and 17th 
centuries 
encarnacion is in the heart of the area where jesuit priests 
founded 30 missions in an effort to convert guarani indians from 
1608 until 1767 when the spanish crown expelled the order from 
latin america 
among those attending the prayer meeting were several thousand 
argentines many from polish immigrant communities who crossed a 
recently completed bridge linking argentina and paraguay 
the asuncion daily newspaper patria run by stroessners 
colorado party criticized a papal meeting tuesday night with a 
churchpicked group of cultural and civic leaders that included 
opposition activists the group is known as the builders of 
society 
there is no doubt about the opposition ideologizing 
politicizing and manipulation of everything concerned with the 
meeting patria declared it would be better to call them a 
grabbag of societys destroyers 
in an editorial patria labeled rene recalde an organizer of 
the meeting an ideologized element from the extremist sector of 
radicalization 
government officials and colorado party members boycotted the 
meeting which paraguayan authorities originally canceled but later 
permitted after the vatican protested 
at the meeting the pope heard denunciations of political 
oppression and then told his cheering audience it is impossible 
to speak of true liberty and even less of democracy where there 
is no real participation by all citizens 
stroessner 75 took power in a 1954 military coup and recently 
was elected to an eighth term in voting his opponents say was 
rigged the local church has regularly criticized his human rights 
record and authoritiarian style pressing for a more pluralistic 
form of government in this landlocked nation of 38 million people 
wednesday marked the second time john paul had celebrated his 
birthday outside rome since becoming pope nearly 10 years ago he 
celebrated his 65th birthday in belgium 
about 1000 wellwishers serenaded him in the morning at the 
vatican envoys residence in asuncion the pope emerged to greet 
the crowd and told them i still feel young especially when i am 
with young people

the winter coat that olga boguslavskys friend 
found at the gum department store during her buying trip to moscow 
cost 730 rubles thats 1170 or almost four months pay for the 
average soviet industrial worker 
for the same money she could have bought enough meat at state 
subsidized prices to last for six years 
consider too the case of the collective farmer who can sell 
the government a kilogram 22 pounds of meat for the established 
wholesale price of 4 rubles and then turn around and use that same 
money to buy back twice as much meat at subsidized retail prices 
economists spearheading soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs 
economic reforms use examples like these to argue that the 
staterun economys price structure must be revamped 
but soviet consumers long accustomed to lowpriced necessities 
worry openly that higher prices may be the only effects they feel 
from gorbachevs sweeping modernization program 
yet the cost of products is only one of the problems faced by 
soviet consumers when merchandise is available theres the 
interminable wait on line to purchase it and often the products 
are of inferior quality 
the government reported last month that staterun enterprises in 
the first three months of the year had trouble meeting the 
countrys needs in many fields from shoes to machine tools 
gorbachev acknowledges there has been little improvement in 
consumer supplies since he came into power three years ago 
speaking to a gathering of farm workers in march he said a 
person is willing and able to pay for consumer services but the 
trouble is that there is seldom any person or establishment 
supplying them 
a month earlier he told the communist party central committee 
there have been virtually no tangible changes for the better in 
the quality of consumer goods 
he acknowledged that perestroika his effort to rebuild and 
modernize the soviet economy will be successful only if those 
problems can be solved 
but he also has complained that bread which costs about 30 
kopeks 50 cents a loaf is so cheap that children use it for 
footballs 
overhauling prices and new laws designed to make local 
enterprises selfsupporting are at the heart of gorbachevs 
economic reforms 
the state now spends 84 billion rubles 134 billion a year on 
subsidies and that is expected to rise to 104 billion rubles 166 
billion by 1990 of that 80 billion rubles 128 billion will be 
spent to subsidize food said economist vi shprygin of the soviet 
institute for research 
gorbachev and his economic advisers say they will try to ease 
the impact of reduced subsidies but it wont be easy for him to 
convince consumers that the higher prices that come with reduced 
subsidies are in their best interest 
the communist party newspaper pravda receives more letters 
complaining about the price of consumer goods than on any other 
issue 
so it was for ms boguslavskys friend who had come to moscow 
on a buying trip from the ural mountains 
beating our feet into the helpless pavement around the store 
in the end we buy the coat for 700 rubles ms boguslavsky 
wrote in a recent edition of pravda after all she said you 
cant just wrap yourself in a blanket 
who needs the kind of perestroika in which they raise prices 
for food and everday goods that are in short supply a nasedkin 
of the russian village of bogdanovo wrote in the government 
newspaper izvestia an increase in prices contradicts 
perestroika it must be accompanied by a lowering of prices 
the newspaper komsomolskaya pravda blamed a sugar shortage that 
has emptied shelves in many areas not only on moonshiners who are 
said to be using it to make up for stateimposed vodka shortages 
but on rumors that the price is about to rise 
soviet consumers face regular price increases despite the 
semblance of stability offered by prices printed or stamped on 
merchandise 
cheaper products that factories cannot sell or make profitably 
simply disappear from the stores to be replaced by slightly 
different versions at higher prices 
ms boguslavsky said the cost of childrens shoes has gone up 60 
percent in the last decade a western visitor to the black sea port 
of odessa recently could find no umbrella in the city of almost 1 
million people for less than 27 rubles 46 
american economist ed hewett of the brookings institution noted 
during a recent visit to moscow that food price increases prompted 
the disturbances that led to the founding of the solidarity 
movement in poland in 1980 and that prices are an issue in recent 
unrest there 
he said hungary considered food prices too volatile and 
straightened out wholesale prices first then gave consumers such 
freqent warnings that there was little reaction when prices finally 
went up 
hewitt said retail price reforms in the soviet union could wait 
while economists try to straighten out the price of coal and other 
industrial goods but instead he said soviet officials are 
running up little flags and watching the bullet holes from upset 
consumers

with two swimming pools in its 
sports complex and a fleet of buses that take workers to the 
fields the victory collective farm might look strange to most us 
farmers 
while their american counterparts live in lone homesteads 
surrounded by barns and acres of land soviet farm workers inhabit 
small wood or brick houses clustered along paved streets in a 
central town private vegetable gardens take up practically every 
inch of spare ground 
the farms managers like to impress visitors with statistics 
the collective has 277 tractors 22 dining rooms two 
kindergartens a stadium and a sports complex with a small 
swimmming pool for beginners and a larger pool for adults a total 
of 4678 people live on the farm 
it is a showcase of soviet collective agriculture set on 20000 
hectares 47000 acres of southern russias best farm land due in 
part to innovative techniques for improving productivity the 
farms production figures far outstrip national averages 
but despite the operation of 50000 such collective and state 
farms employing 25 million workers soviet agriculture is in a 
state of crisis the soviet union still must import grain to feed 
its own people last year agricultural output fell 3 percent 
according to us intelligence agencies 
zhores a medvedev a soviet geneticist with years of training 
in agriculture notes in his 1988 book soviet agriculture 
that farming takes 35 percent of the soviet investment budget 
depriving industry and consumers of funds goods and services they 
need the system doesnt produce enough equipment to plow or 
harvest 
all parts of the food program are moving except for the 
production of food he says 
soviet agriculture has been plagued for decades by central 
planners who tell farms what and how much to plant lack of 
incentives for farmers to work the stateowned land inefficient 
production and poor storage and transportation facilities 
soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev a peasants son who directed 
agricultural policy before taking charge of the communist party 
three years ago wants to increase incentives for farm workers to 
improve performance but he has stopped short of challenging the 
states monopoly on land ownership 
the inefficiency of the collectivefarm system is demonstrated 
by the extraordinary productivity of the small private plots farm 
workers are permitted to till for their personal use according to 
western statistics private plots occupy only 3 percent of the land 
but provide about a third of the nations meat 40 percent of the 
eggs and 60 percent of the potatoes 
victory farm officials say they have been using financial 
bonuses and other incentives for 20 years to encourage farmers to 
work harder and take care of stateowned machinery and they say 
their efforts have paid off in higher production figures 
farm facilities such as the canning factory feed mill storage 
facilities and greenhouses lush with cucumbers and tomatoes are 
expected to pay for themselves if they do everyone profits 
the better everyone works the more money they will make 
said greenhouse manager viktor solovyev showing off wooden crates 
packed with cucumbers being shipped north we understand the 
economics very well 
with a yearend 100percent bonus for meeting production 
targets greenhouse workers can make 5000 rubles 8000 a year 
solovyev said thats about twice the average industrial wage but 
money alone isnt enough to make people work harder there must 
also be consumer services and goods worth buying 
that is one of the primary goals of gorbachevs perestroika 
or restructuring of the economy and society 
gorbachev told collective farmers at a march conference in 
moscow he believes the bureaucratic system prevents most of them 
from being as successful as they should be 
give people the right conditions and theyll find a way to 
increase production he said 
the soviet leader has consolidated agriculture under a single 
ministry preached selfreliance and encouraged smaller work teams 
to increase efficiency and higher pay for those who work harder 
farmvillage complexes are traditional in some areas of the 
soviet union having grown out of a feudal system of land 
management that operated for centuries before the 1917 bolshevik 
revolution 
private farms prospered briefly under the new economic policy of 
the 1920s the period following the communists breakup of large 
estates severe repression and grain requisitioning during the 
russian civil war that came on the heels of the revolution 
but in the 1930s dictator josef v stalin violently imposed 
collectivization of agriculture executing or exiling those who 
opposed his efforts to control all land and production 
the kuban area where the victory farm is located in a 
relatively warm climate not far from the black sea is among the 
regions that suffered most from the famine that swept the country 
during collectivization and the hardships of nazi occupation during 
world war ii 
this year the international wheat council estimates the soviet 
union will import 34 million tons of grain but says improved 
technology offers every possibility for better harvests 
still vast quantities of food spoil in storage or shipment 
during half the year it is nearly impossible to find vegetables 
other than potatoes onions carrots or cabbage in moscow when 
other produce can be found it is in the markets where farmers sell 
what they produce on their private plots 
the victory farms basic work is done from clearings set amid 
the rich flat fields of wheat sugar beets and sunflowers that 
spread for 17 kilometers 10 miles in each direction from a 
central landing strip for crop dusters 
a fleet of 35 buses provides free transportation every morning 
to farflung areas where workers tend fields and orchards raise 
pigs and milk cows mix insecticides and prepare cattle feed 
just after 5 pm on a recent spring day buses filled the 
streets in a sort of village rush hour as they dropped farmers off 
at the end of the work day hours are longer when the work demands 
and shorter during slack periods 
most of the farms crop work is done by brigades groups of 100 
or so farmers who work from clearings where machinery is stored 
each brigade has a dining room where the workers can eat three 
meals a day for less than a ruble 160 
but pursuing the smallerisbetter idea gorbachev has pushed 
regional officials in krasnodar are trying smaller brigades of 
three to 10 people which they say seem to be most efficient and 
they are studying plans to set up a bank account for each team to 
emphasize the need for profitability 
gorbachev has made clear that the state will continue to rely on 
private gardens 
under new legislation city dwellers may be allotted up to 600 
square meters yards of land outside their cities to plant 
gardens they are eligible for loans of up to 5000 rubles 8000 
to build a small hut on the plot 
sergei zhilin administrator of the krasnodar regions program 
for private plots said there are about 70000 of them in the area 
and more than 1 million throughout the country 
gorbachevs efforts to decentralize decisionmaking would give 
more farm managers the leeway that victory collective farm 
officials have had to try new ideas and adapt to local conditions 
that central planners in the moscow bureaucracy cant anticipate 
bureaucrats gorbachev said coerce command and continue 
issuing orders about when and how things should be done when to 
sow plow and so on they just cannot reorganize this is what i 
would describe as the critical line of perestroika

contraband enters the soviet union and city officials reluctantly 
concede it is true 
deputy mayor galina izuvita blames lax security in checking the 
cargo of incoming ships in this respect we are envious of cities 
that do not have ports through which drugs can enter ms izuvita 
said 
port manager nikolai pavliuk who has worked in the harbor for 
28 years counters never has anyone been found to have taken 
part in illegal transit of contraband 
but to sasha a 30yearold construction worker and drug dealer 
odessa is still mama 
at a darkened cafe sasha surreptitiously gulped cognac from a 
coffee cup and fanned a wad of several thousand rubles to show that 
the benefits of trading currencies and narcotics far exceed the 230 
rubles 387 a month he earns from his legitimate job 
organized crime networks fed by smuggled goods flourished in 
mama odessa in the chaos that followed the destruction of the 
port during russias civil war 
writer isaac babel had but to change a few names to pass city 
life for fiction mobster benny krik the likeable hero of the 
odessa tales was modeled after odessas mishka the japanese 
but stalins terror suppressed the mobs and 70 years of 
socialism have rebuilt the port housed the orphans and more 
recently shut down the obvious dens of iniquity 
official efforts to tame odessas anythinggoes spirit have 
pasted a veneer of respectability over the city youth clubs and 
dance halls now occupy vacated bars and liquor shops 
the authorities launch periodic anticorruption drives but a 
steady influx of contraband has kept the black markets alive and 
cleanup campaigns are usually shortlived 
gypsy fortunetellers cast a wary eye around each club or cafe 
before whispering to a patron at the low wooden tables that the 
secrets of the future can be had for two rubles 340 
many of the citys elegant old buildings were closed or 
demolished during a building and refurbishing binge but a glimpse 
of odessas lost grandeur is still visible above the colorless 
facades and cloudy store windows on deribasovskaya street 
three or four stories above metal store signs with unimaginative 
names like shoes womens clothing and sundries 
rooftops sport disintegrating cupolas and cornices and leaded 
windows from which most of the glass has fallen out 
a renovation plan begun five years ago touched off a campaign to 
preserve odessas landmarks and in early april chief architect 
vasily mironenko was fired after proposing to cut down the famed 
chestnut trees along primorsky boulevard overlooking the port 
many odessans oppose their citys changing appearance 
a cab driver traveling through the renovated moldavanka 
neighborhood contended there is an official plot in the soviet 
capital to force odessa into the moscow mold 
odessa is not a phenomenon anymore he said its just a 
town 
the driver was quoting odessa writer mikhail shvanetsky who 
said the same about the city in the underground literature he 
circulated in the 1970s

when the last of four operations was 
completed the surgeon reminded his young guatemalan patient that 
she owed him a dinner of black beans and rice 
we agreed upon that fee dr john johnson told nicolasa 
menchu a 27yearold student who came to the united states on a 
scholarship and ended up having surgery to correct a 142degree 
curvature of the spine 
johnson had warned ms menchu that without surgery the 
curvature would eventually choke off her vital organs resulting in 
death 
the procedure that johnson proposed carried no guarantees 
theres a 60 percent chance of success a 20 percent chance of no 
improvement and a 20 percent chance that you wont survive he 
told her 
ms menchu made her decision in midfebruary i decided to 
gamble on an operation even though im accustomed to the way i 
am she said 
at the time she was 3 feet 11 inches tall and weighed 64 
pounds today she is 2inches taller the curvature has dropped 
to 90 degrees and she is gaining weight 
she also is preparing to return to classes at the university of 
louisville under a united states information agency scholarship 
the agency brought 154 students to this country in january 1986 in 
an effort to offset soviet influence in central america 
while swimming last fall ms menchu developed breathing 
problems and was turned over to johnson codirector of the spine 
clinic at norton hospital and assistant professor of orthopedic 
surgery at the universitys medical school 
in the hospital johnson bolted a metal band to her skull and 
attached weights to stretch her spine 
thats your halo he told her because youve been so good 
about everything 
two more operations removed bone chips from her spine 
the final step came in march when johnson hooked up a set of 
rods to his patients spine for more straightening and stability 
his team used a magnet doughnut attached to ms menchus 
head to warn it when the surgery threatened the spinal cord 
the magnet sends a discharge into the arms and legs causing 
them to react he explained at first niko could move only one 
leg or the other we must have started and stopped seven times 
before both limbs worked in unison 
ordinarily the surgery and hospital stay would cost 89000 
but johnson is donating his services and norton expects to cover 
the remainder 
because of the long recuperative period the usia extended ms 
menchus scholarship 
hopefully ill get my bachelors degree in education by 
christmas and be ready to go home she said 
her family lives in totonicapan where she once made and sold 
pottery to help finance her education 
although she still has some pain and cannot yet sit in a chair 
ms menchu said its been worth it a thousand times and ive 
grown a lot 
she was close to tears however on may 9 when the university 
graduated the 12 other foreign students who had accompanied her to 
the louisville campus 
my turn is coming i guess

televisions two best new shows are off the 
air just now but both seem likely to return in the fall let us 
give thanks 
in a purely personal survey franks place on cbs and the 
wonder years on abc tied for best new show the runnerup was 
abcs china beach 
with the season over lets take a look back at the best and the 
worst this is strictly one reporters opinion and there are no 
awards or booby prizes 
franks place which stars tim reid as a new england college 
professor who inherits his fathers creole restaurant in new 
orleans is wellwritten and has wonderfully defined characters 
its a socalled dramedy with few laughs but the stories are 
grabbing and get into the characters its also the first tv show 
to capture the essence of new orleans and appreciate the difference 
between creole and cajun 
the wonder years told from the perspective of an adult 
looking back on his youth is like reliving adolescence but in the 
safety and sweet privacy of your living room it all rings true 
the domineering older brother the nerdy best friend the confusing 
infatuation with girls and the parents who want to help but dont 
quite understand 
china beach which tells of the women in vietnam has 
wonderfully drawn characters you really care about these people 
here are other best shows of the year 
la law nbc the writing is unbelievably good at times 
bordering on tasteless and tacky yet so right for these offbeat 
welldefined wellcast characters 
st elsewhere nbc another show with great writing that 
dared to take chances and push the limitations of taste and 
naughtiness 
newhart cbs an underrated show that is a perfect blending 
of concept writing characters and acting its always true to its 
characters always funny 
beauty and the beast cbs the show that took the years 
corniest concept and made it work as the most romantic show of 
recent memory 
designing women cbs the first show to find southern women 
both intelligent and incredibly funny 
aarons way nbc wonderful schmaltz wellwritten best 
family show of the year that didnt do it any good though nbc 
canceled it 
golden girls nbc you know exactly how each character will 
react yet you cant wait for them to do it funny funny funny 
cheers nbc best comeback of the year the show seemed to 
be on its way out but they gave it a fresh new look kirstie 
alley deserves an emmy 
night court nbc naughty naughty naughty and incredibly 
funny 
tour of duty cbs it isnt platoon but its not bad 
other good shows murder she wrote on cbs matlock on 
nbc and head of the class and perfect strangers both on 
abc 
audiences couldnt seem to decide about nbcs the days and 
nights of molly dodd nbc did its canceled 
the jury is still out on abcs hooperman john ritter is 
televisions best comic actor but hes too restrained here 
abcs dolly proved once again that variety is dead dolly 
parton sings well and has a winning personality but her show 
didnt cut it abc has decided to do away with the weekly show but 
says parton might do other projects for the network 
the pits 
highwayman nbc dumb from every standpoint including some 
of the worst acting or nonacting ever seen on television 
a different world nbc the only thing that would improve 
this unfunny show is to send lisa bonet back to the cosby show 
supercarrier abc a good idea turned into a cartoon 
the most disappoining show was abcs moonlighting it was a 
case of the mighty falling on its face it was once a great show 
but now who cares 
special categories 
best show on pbs wonderworks consistently firstrate 
best tv movie nbcs the ann jillian story 
best miniseries nbcs gore vidals lincoln

agribusiness has not escaped the urge to 
merge that has caused many companies to disappear as individual 
entities in recent years 
but is merger mania good for farming 
robert glassman financial vice president of fresnos britz 
inc thinks so he says bigger concerns can exert more clout 
especially in dealing with large wholesale buyers of raw or 
processed foods 
glassman whose company is engaged in family farming and 
distribution of crops and fertilizers expects continued 
consolidation of the now widely dispersed fruit and produce 
industry to offset antitrust restrictions he said favor big grocery 
chains 
grocers can call each other and ask how much are you paying 
for raisins today glassman said we cant call each other and 
ask what are you selling raisins for today 
antitrust laws should be revised to give agribusiness more 
flexibility in setting prices glassman said at a recent forum 
sponsored by the california chapter of the american society of farm 
managers and rural appraisers 
he noted that farmers received 50 percent of the money american 
consumers spent on food in the 1950s but the farmers share fell 
to 30 percent in 1986 and 28 percent last year 
this trend may eventually put us all out of business and we 
must as farmers and marketers reverse it now glassman said 
softening of antitrust laws seems unlikely so glassman expects 
mergers in the agribusiness area to continue 
but charles bonner president of bonner packing of fresno said 
a report in business week magazine showed 70 percent of business 
acquisitions were failures resulting in lower stock prices and a 
drop in market share for the surviving companies 
i think a lot of acquisitions we have seen in agriculture the 
last 10 years have been unmitigated disasters bonner said 
david r smith president of dole citrus in ontario calif 
countered that some companies such as paramount properties seek 
out undervalued properties in their area of expertise citrus and 
nuts paramount is a diversified farming company based in 
bakersfield calif 
paramount focuses on two main commodity groups that allows 
them to move quickly to evaluate property and make purchases 
before anybody else can make that determination and get capital 
together to make the purchase smith said 
on the other hand doles parent company castle amp cooke inc 
looks for purchases that will increase its share of a given market 
but bonner contended that companies can be fooled when they buy 
land or processors they think are inexpensive 
when we bought a dried fruit plant we stole that asset but 
were still paying for it said bonner citing a decision by his 
family raisinprocessing company to diversify 
what can start as a real cheap price often turns out to be an 
expensive education bonner said weve had a couple of those 
he noted that tenneco west spent a decade and more than 30 
million advertising its own raisin brand sun giant bonner 
contended that the petroleum company wound up with 64 percent of 
the 200 million united states raisin market or about 13 million 
in sales which he translated to a profit of perhaps 200000 a 
year 
that i think is one of the reasons tenneco assets were 
undervalued after 10 years said bonner noting that dole 
purchased tennecos farming assets 
smith said doles aim in acquisitions is based more on cash flow 
than liquidation values 
when we look at acreage we look at the environment in which 
it exists today and the environment in which it will exist in five 
to 10 years smith said

fireplaces are hot swimming pools are not and 
kitchens and baths are the rage of the season 
thats the latest from the burgeoning homeimprovement industry 
whose business has gone through the roof in recent years as an 
increasing number of us homeowners spruce up whats probably 
their single biggest investment 
building was in the 50s what remodeling is in the 80s 
said jacelyn swensen a spokeswoman for the national association of 
the remodeling industry which proclaimed may national remodeling 
month 
the census bureau says 94 billion was spent on home remodeling 
nationwide last year up 4 percent from 1986 and 102 percent from 
1982 and the national association of home builders predicts 98 
billion in expenditures this year 
while such improvements will help augment a homes resale value 
not all remodeling costs are fully recoverable experts warn 
with a belowground swimming pool you only get a third of 
what you put in at the most said ms swensen some people i 
guess are turned off by the maintenance and upkeep the health 
hazards and added insurance 
those adding a fireplace on the other hand could recoup as 
much as 58 percent beyond the original investment she said 
other popular remodeling projects and estimated return on 
investment according to the nari include 
adding a full bath between 74 percent to 126 percent 
greenhouse addition 29 percent to 100 percent 
adding skylights 34 percent to 94 percent 
major kitchen remodeling 73 percent to 90 percent 
reroofing 85 percent 
adding insulation and siding 77 percent 
adding a deck 64 percent to 80 percent 
bathroom remodeling 80 percent 
new windows and doors 38 percent to 75 percent 
room addition 53 percent to 72 percent 
the magazine practical homeowner says doityourselfers stand to 
recoup even more of their original investments although appraisers 
warn that a lessthanperfect job can sometimes backfire 
practical homeowner says the national average recovery rate for 
those ambitious enough to install a fireplace on their own is 220 
percent with the cost averaging 1280 vs 3010 for a 
professional job 
handy homeowners could see an average payback of 185 percent on 
kitchen remodeling with the cost averaging 3150 vs 6930 the 
magazine said 
real estate experts say alterations are most likely to raise a 
homes resale value when theres a wider variety of homes in a 
neighborhood along with a variety of prices for recently sold 
homes they note however that even the most expensive and 
extensive renovations wont raise a home completely out of the 
price range for other neighborhood houses 
the most marketable features experts say are modern bathrooms 
and kitchens wellmaintained landscaping and neutral colors in 
paint and wallpaper 
ms swensen said renovations most in demand by homeowners this 
year include kitchen and bathroom remodeling skylights ceramic 
tile and basement and attic conversions out of fashion she said 
are energy conservation projects such as double or triplepane 
windows 
since a lot of homes were built after world war ii from 1950 
to 1960 a lot of money is being spent on modernizing and 
adding more space ms swensen said 
gopal ahluwalia director of research for the homebuilders 
association said that at least half of the postwar babyboomers 
are homeowners who have seen their family sizes and incomes 
increase in recent years at the same time home prices have risen 
sharply he noted 
therefore more people are making the decision that its a 
better value to stay put and remodel rather than move added 
brian patchan remodeling director of the homebuilders trade group 
homeowners are also finding lots of money available for 
remodeling through homeequity loans where rates are sometimes 
lower than those offered for conventional mortgages

in heavily secularized modern society 
statistics indicate the churches arent getting their job done by 
working at it separately so theyre tackling it together 
thats the pathbreaking commitment of a broad coalition of 
american church leaders roman catholic and nearly every brand of 
protestant to reclaim those detached from religion 
the time has come for us to stop the quarreling with one 
another the rivalry and sheepstealing and learn to work together 
in mission says the rev alvin a illig of washington dc 
illig director of the paulist national catholic evangelization 
association and a key figure in the wide crosssection of church 
leaders concerned with evangelism added in an interview 
the great challenge before us is reaching out to the huge mass 
of people not involved in churches and synagogues weve all got to 
work together on it if we are to have any success in 
evangelization 
spurring this collaboration is the aim of an unprecedented 
multidenominational congress 88 a national festival of 
evangelism in chicago aug 47 planning for it has gone on for 
three years 
it is backed by a rare alliance of church specialists in 
evangelism from about 35 denominations ranging from mennonite to 
catholic mainline to pentecostal and salvation army to southern 
baptist 
its a breakthrough of real significance illig said 
if southern baptists and catholics and a coalition of this 
scope can come together and work harmoniously its ecumenical 
enough to encourage a lot of folks that they can too 
a similarly inclusive affair a gathering of christians 
takes place may 2125 in arlington texas expected to involve 
about 3000 evangelical mainline protestant catholic and eastern 
orthodox christians 
however that assembly is intended mainly to vent collective 
spiritual energies and concerns about contemporary social issues 
on the other hand the chicago congress which hopes to bring 
together up to 15000 church people has a threefold practical 
purpose to sharpen awareness of the need for evangelism to offer 
advice from experts on various ways of doing it and to provide 
resource materials for participants to take home and use 
we can learn from each other illig said lutherans 
catholics mennonites and presbyterians sharing their insights 
can learn from one another in building the kingdom of god 
he said the urgency of steppedup concerted evangelizing 
efforts to bring in those outside the fold is pointed up by the 
growing ranks of unchurched americans now totaling 90 million 
to a large extent weve ignored them in terms of specific 
outreach programs he said 
meanwhile this group has increased in 10 years from 38 percent 
of the population to 41 percent he said while the proportion 
without even a religious preference has risen from 3 percent in 
1948 to 9 percent now 
theres no question were losing ground illig said adding 
that out of an average five congregations only one is growing one 
is shrinking and three are simply static remaining the same 
one reason were failing and not making any progress is the 
scandal of divisions that is confusing and contradicts the basic 
nature of christianity he said 
while the unusual cooperation on the problem cant mend the 
brokenness he said it can share insights and approaches kindle 
mutual energies and enlist the various churches in the common task 
in doing it he said people drawn into religious participation 
will naturally pick the particular church community to enrich 
their own lives whatever the denomination 
weve got to stop fighting one another and together raise 
consciousness about the huge communities out there without any 
religious life he said 
planning for the joint congress developed through the washington 
roundtable on evangelism comprised of specialists on evangelism 
from various denominations 
the rev grady allison of new york evangelism director for the 
presbyterian church usa and president of the congress board of 
directors sayswe have christ in common we have the scriptures 
in common we have a concern for people in common other matters 
that have kept us apart are of lesser importance 
the rev paul benjamin of the christian church disciples of 
christ head the national churchgrowth research center in 
washington and executive director for the congress cites the 
millions unchurched and says it has been well said that the cost 
of a divided church is an unbelieving world we can no longer 
afford the luxury of our competing divisions 
illig 61 is treasurer for the event which is expected to cost 
more than 1 million with more than 60 denominational agencies and 
catholic orders putting up advance funding with registrations 
expected to cover it 
he also is a longtime practiced evangelist on the american 
scene a mission for which his paulist order was founded in this 
country in 1858 at a time when catholic evangelism was virtually 
nonexistent

people who live together before marriage 
should be denied a full church wedding because such a wedding 
would be dishonor and instead be married in a lowkey ceremony 
hartford archbishop john f whealon said in a column published in 
the catholic transcript 
i would be happy to witness your marriage in a simple quiet 
ceremony with two witnesses and perhaps your immediate families 
whealon said he would tell such couples his comments were 
addressed to priests confronted with the issue 
whealon said however couples living together should be granted 
a full marriage ceremony if they are willing to live separately 
and chastely until they are married 
the statement serves as an advisory and does not set policy 
parish priests say they make the ultimate decisions on church 
weddings based on pastoral consideration 
whealon said cohabitating couples who want an extravagant 
church wedding are in effect asking the church to provide tacit 
approval to unacceptable behavior

an ancient road traveled by the likes 
of genghis khan marco polo and babur has become an active artery 
of commerce today between china and pakistan 
more than 2000 years ago silk and spices made their way out of 
china on the route while gold silver and wool made their way in 
the commerce today is considerably more diverse if not as 
exotic 
as many as 80 pakistani merchants travel the road into china 
each day in battered buses to buy silk porcelain and pearls and 
chinese businessmen head in the opposite direction toward the 
khunjerab pass on the border as part of a barter arrangement 
between the two countries 
the barter enables the chinese to trade hydroelectric equipment 
farm tools textiles quilts and porcelain for pakistani 
cigarettes medical herbs dried fruits shoes and razor blades 
the volume of official barter has increased to the equivalent of 
3 million in the past year compared to 300000 in 1986 
according to sadeq malek sales officer of pakistans northern 
areas traders cooperatives 
the road also is being traveled more and more by tourists 
from pakistans border post of sost the road follows the hunza 
river then runs along the icy khunjerab river into china crossing 
numerous glaciers as it climbs to the khunjerab pass it goes 
through a series of narrow chasms and steep declines 
at tashkargan the first chinese town across the border workmen 
are building hotels and inns to accommodate the growing number of 
travelers passing through 
kamel tahsin manager of the governmentrun pamir hotel in 
tashkargan said the new hotels will be more modern and better 
equipped 
business is getting better he said so we have to add a 
couple of wings to our hotel 
tahsin is one of about 12000 people in tashkargan who are 
shiite moslem tajiks the tribe dominant in the area they are 
distinguishable by their sharp features and their women by their 
colorful costume 
across the border in sost pakistanis also are building to meet 
the growing flow of tourists 
assif khan a pakistani government tourist official said big 
tour groups now travel to china four times a month compared to 
twice a month a year ago 
but its a tough road to travel says amanollah mogul the bus 
driver who makes the journey about once a day back and forth to 
china

when steve wynn first visited here in 
1952 sharing his fathers dream of a flashy bingo parlor on a 
patch of desert called the strip 5 million could have bought the 
clump of casinos that captivated the 10yearold 
today wynn is spending more than a hundred times that amount on 
a desert paradise that staggers even his immense imagination a 
new golden nugget hotel and casino on the las vegas strip 
the youngster who was starstruck by this neon fantasyland 36 
years ago has become nevadas golden boy with a penchant for 
pizazz and a flair for doing deals he promises the best is yet to 
come for the city that sent his father back to maryland in 1952 
nursing busted dreams 
you aint seen nothin yet boasted wynn chairman of golden 
nugget inc and listed by forbes magazine as one of the 800 most 
powerful executives in america 
equally at home in the boardroom or at the blackjack table wynn 
has taken the golden nugget from a honkytonk casino in downtowns 
glitter gulch to one of the nations premier gaming companies with 
revenues of about 190 million a year and hes betting 550 
million that his new resort scheduled to open in the summer or 
fall of 1989 will be a wonderment the world will flock to see 
wynn already has 200 million invested in the golden nugget 
downtown where the las vegas gaming industry was born he says his 
new 3300room property on the strip now attracting a more upscale 
breed of gambling visitor is the forerunner to other giant 
developments there 
for half a billion dollars you could have owned the entire 
state of nevada wynn said comparing his blossoming resort with 
his first visit to las vegas in the 50s 
his father michael hoped to open a bingo parlor on the 
sparselysettled strip in those days but a downtown casino heard 
of his plans and opened its own operation forcing wynn and his son 
to return east ironically that casino was the golden nugget 
steve wynn returned to las vegas in 1967 with a 35000 
bankroll he engineered a deal with the late billionaire howard 
hughes for a piece of land next to caesars palace resold it to the 
resort months later for a 1 million profit and used that money to 
buy into the nugget 
today that 1 million would hardly cause a ripple in this 
gaming capital 
weve already invested more money in this property downtown 
than the entire capital expenditure of the city of las vegas 
wynn said in a recent interview in his office atop the downtown 
resort 
the enormous megabuck investment is not only necessary it has 
become the safest route to take wynn said weve learned that 
a destination resort like las vegas is the perfect launching pad 
for bigger and better projects this place is a big huge roaring 
successful destination resort with people coming from all around 
the world 
with nearly 17 million visitors expected in 1988 and tourism 
growing at a doubledigit pace each year wynn says golden nugget 
wont be the last giant property built on the booming strip where 
20000 new hotel rooms are under construction or planned 
wynn admits he suffered from an attack of cold feet seven years 
ago when he shelved plans for a similar project down the strip 
from his present development 
i started one of these babies for 400 million in 1981 and 
chickened out wynn recalled we didnt know the impact of new 
jersey on nevada we had a recession starting that scared the 
dickens out of everybody we didnt know how las vegas would handle 
a recession how it would handle a recession including atlantic 
city and deregulation of the airlines there were no nonstop 
flights here from the east coast anymore 
those questions were frightening frightening enough for me to 
say hey i aint gonna spend 400 million we could make a 
mistake now five six years later we saw what happened with the 
recession practically nothing we saw what happened with the 
airlines that hurt a little bit but we overcame it we saw what 
happened with atlantic city 18 billion in gambling in nevada 
in 1979 to 5 billion today nobody dreamed there was that kind of 
elasticity in america 
wynn said he has already talked with caesars chairman henry 
gluck about joint ventures on major sporting events particularly 
boxing when completed late next year the nugget and caesars will 
occupy a onemile stretch of the famous strip 
wynn bristles at competitor donald trumps claim that atlantic 
city has stolen from las vegas the title of boxing capital of the 
world trump has in recent months landed the mike tysonlarry 
holmes fight and the upcoming tysonmichael spinks bout 
hed better make that claim while he can because he wont be 
able to make it long wynn vowed 
the two gaming giants are hardly best of friends trump has been 
quoted as calling wynn a classic underachiever wynn has called 
trump twinkle toes 
the two were competitors when wynn owned the golden nugget in 
atlantic city wynns sale of the atlantic city nugget to bally 
corp for 440 million last year was a factor in blocking trumps 
efforts to take over ballys 
months later trump announced he had bought a 49 percent stake 
in golden nugget inc and indicated he might try to acquire 
controlling interest in wynns company wynn still fumes over the 
publicity trump generated from that move 
he did that for publicity and admitted it wynn growled 
he never owned 5 percent he owned 2 or 3 and he sold it right 
away 
will the new nugget be locking horns with trump for the big 
fights you bet we will wynn vowed 
wall street analysts are generally high on wynn and his 
enthusiasm but a little less confident about the gaming markets 
capacity to support his dreams 
daniel lee an analyst for the investment firm drexel burnham 
lambert inc said wynns income estimates for the new resort may 
be overly optimistic considering the competition on the strip 
the big uncertainty is what that casino can do lee said 
i think it will be successful because of steve wynn

almost daily the 2500 workers at 
tadzhiktextilmash are told of the blessings of mikhail s 
gorbachevs economic reforms their freedom to arn more and the 
need to work harder 
and all this has many at the sprawling machinery works in soviet 
central asia deeply worried about their paychecks which average 
230 rubles 380 a month 
yes comrades are concerned acknowledged abdumansour 
abdurashidov communist party chief at the factory in the capital 
of tadzhikistan when there is change the change creates worry 
and there have been a lot of changes 
since gorbachev became communist party leader in march 1985 the 
tenets of a halfcentury of topheavy bureaucratic management by 
command have been shaken and new concepts introduced 
notions like profitability the desirability of foreign 
investment individual enterprise and salary differentials to 
reward achievement all once denounced as symptoms of capitalist 
exploitation are now treated with respect as the soviet leadership 
struggles to revive a vast but stagnant economy 
so great has been the shock of gorbachevs campaign for 
perestroika or fullscale economic restructuring that some 
soviets have been wondering whether they are still living in a 
socialist state 
some are panicking there are people who think everything is 
collapsing gorbachev said last month now it seems to some 
that socialism is vanishing 
in microcosm the tadzhiktextilmash factory which makes a gamut 
of products from cottonspinning machines to cookware and electric 
ranges shows the challenges confronting gorbachev and his allies 
as they strive to streamline and modernize the nations economy 
managers here talk convincingly about the pressing need for 
perestroika but as it is at other factories across the 
country the reform drive seems so far to have yielded very meager 
results except in words 
in january more than 76000 factories and farms responsible for 
60 percent of the countrys output were subjected to a new law that 
requires them to depend on their own earnings rather than 
injections of government funds for operating revenue 
tadzhiktextilmash was not among them 
we are not ready yet to work on full economic 
selfaccounting valery n vozhdayev the enterprises 
chainsmoking director for engineering said in a recent interview 
were also not ready to have direct sales ties with foreign 
firms 
only 8 percent of tadzhiktextilmashs multifaceted product line 
is exported and most of its clearly outmoded products could never 
hope to compete in a free market when we can sell our cotton 
spinners in the united states the situation will be normal 
vozhdayev said 
gorbachevs rise to power in the soviet union has wrought many 
and varied transformations but none has been more dramatic than in 
the demands made on the 130 millionmember labor force including 
the men and women of tadzhiktextilmash 
socialism gorbachevstyle means letting local managers make 
more decisions pegging wages more closely to job performance and 
in theory at least the shutting down of factories that run in the 
red or cant cope with the rules of the new economic game 
for tadzhiktextilmash lathe operators and management personnel 
and for the rest of the soviet labor force this means there will 
be winners and losers in the economic game based on how they 
perform their jobs 
the no 1 concern of workers is for their salary and how it 
will be changed under selfaccounting said abdurashidov 
secondly they are worried about the conditions of work and how 
they might change 
the impetus for abandoning the egalitarianism and uniform 
salaries of the past comes from the very top the person who 
works harder should live better gorbachev has said the 
hardworking person and labor is of this morality 
gorbachev has said repeatedly that perestroika is not a retreat 
from socialism but a bold move forward 
under the reforms he said last month soviet socialism is 
ridding itself of everything that had deformed it in the past and 
is demonstrating tremendous dynamism the wealth of its social and 
humanistic content 
in the economic field at least the results thus far of the 
kremlins campaign for restructuring do not support such a rosy 
statement 
in the first three months of 1988 staterun enterprises had 
trouble meeting the countrys needs in many fields from shoes to 
machine tools the government said in a sobering report in april 
despite stateenforced quality checks shoddy goods are still 
rife in the first three months of this year alone defective color 
television sets stamped made in ussr ignited 180 fires that 
killed four people 
a spring sale in moscow of czechoslovak shoes judged more 
elegant than locally made footwear drew a line of thousands while 
official media said millions of pairs of soviet shoes sat on store 
shelves because they were badly made or already outoffashion when 
produced 
demand still regularly outstrips supply in early 1988 there 
was a shortfall of 44000 vacuum cleaners and as many washing 
machines from plan targets set by state bureaucrats 
a worldwise comment heard recently in moscow goes be thankful 
that mushrooms grow wild in russia because if the government 
starts to grow them there wont be any 
gorbachev has acknowledged that perestroika has brought little 
change in the soviet living standard so far whats more the 
perennial concerns of the soviet citizenry like finding some fresh 
meat or a warm winter coat have now been joined by worries that 
once were thought to have been banished along with capitalism 
soviet economists have said more than 16 million people will be 
laid off in the next 12 years as factories deprived of state 
subsidies are forced to trim their payrolls and government 
ministries slash bureaucratic fat 
sweeping price rises also are foreseen in the 1990s to cut the 
84 billion rubles 134 billion the government now spends annually 
to keep down the cost of bread and other basic goods 
to many soviets those looming spectres of unemployment and 
inflation are exactly what socialism was supposed to guard against 
its like longforgotten times are repeating themselves one 
worried muscovite wrote pravda earlier this year 
nonetheless the kremlin leadership says there is no alternative 
to its blueprint for rejuvenating the economy and it has been 
making room in the pantheon of economic heroes alongside the 
stakhanovite shock workers of the past for the farsighted 
soviet entrepreneur who takes risks 
one example a firm in the ukrainian port of odessa that cans 
fruit juices and jams had thousands of excess cans sitting around 
its warehouses it wanted to unload them and a newly founded 
cooperative saw the chance to make a quick ruble 
the coop bought the cans for 10 kopecks apiece put labels on 
them that said odessa air and sold them on april fools day 
for up to 5 rubles apiece 
that the government daily izvestia enthusiastically noted last 
month is a living illustration of the possibilities of free 
initiative

in the era of glasnost a sentence to years of 
hard labor in a soviet prison camp is not the automatic response to 
dissent greater debate on some topics is allowed but there are 
still limits 
for all the talk about soviet leader mikhail gorbachevs policy 
of openness and tolerance political prisoners remain in jails and 
longtime refuseniks repeatedly denied permission to leave say 
they are worn out 
as long as people are sitting in prison camps and people 
arent allowed to emigrate fear wont be cleansed from the soul 
said lev timofeyev a journalist and economist 
when timofeyev wants to criticize soviet authorities he writes 
his comments into his toshiba computer and runs them off on his 
kodak printer not long ago that would have been inconceivable 
technologically and politically 
timofeyev was arrested shortly after gorbachev took power in 
march 1985 and sentenced to 11 years in prison camp and exile for 
urging economic reform in a book published abroad he was released 
two years later 
and though he now is free along with hundreds of others he 
still speaks of a zone of fear among the dissidents 
beginning with the release of nobel peace prize winner andrei d 
sakharov in december 1986 from exile in gorky gorbachev moved to 
quiet critics of his countrys human rights policies hundreds of 
people were released from jails and prison camps in 1987 
dissidents now express themselves in unofficial publications on 
topics ranging from freedom of religion to ecology and womens 
issues editors of 30 such publications often only a few 
irregularly produced sheets of carbon paper gathered unhindered in 
moscow in early may 
computers still are not widely in use in soviet society 
timofeyev says he received his small computer and printer from 
friends and about 500 copies of each edition of the twicemonthly 
journal referendum can be produced 
that is few for a country of 280 million people timofeyev 
acknowledged we need a xerox he said we need a laser 
printer then wed be able to put out an edition 
but the government owns all printing facilities in the soviet 
union and access to copying machines is guarded closely 
refuseniks are looking for a new voice to present their demands 
and hope for a boost from president reagan when he comes to moscow 
at the end of may 
michael stolar who with his father abe holds an american 
passport said it would be murderous for refuseniks if reagan 
does not draw attention to their cause because it would give the 
soviet union the impression that the united states no longer cares 
he and his father have been granted permission to leave but remain 
because michaels wife julia cannot get an exit visa 
tanya zieman 48 and her husband yuri have been refused 
permission to emigrate for 11 years despite an increase in jewish 
emigration last year to more than 8000 she is convinced it is not 
in the interest of soviet authorities to resolve the emigration 
issue 
what are they going to bargain with she said longtime 
refuseniks are in a terrible state physically and emotionally 
she said theyre worn out 
dissident leaders like yuri orlov and anatoly koryagin have left 
the country anatoly marchenko died in chistopol prison in december 
1986 weeks before sakharov was freed 
sakharov the most authoritative voice on human rights in the 
soviet union has settled since his almost seven years in exile 
into a quieter life devoted to physics and a few selected social 
issues he rarely seeks contact with foreign correspondents but 
has gained acceptance in the soviet press that once vilified him 
sakharov says he has a great opinion of gorbachev as a 
government figure and in personal terms he met jan 15 with 
gorbachev and handed him a list of 200 political prisoners 
dissident sources say 200 is a minimum number of people who 
still are imprisoned for their beliefs but they cannot say 
accurately how many political prisoners there are 
although the government response to dissent has been somewhat 
more tolerant than in the past there are strict limits that 
prevent dissidents from spreading their ideas across the vast 
country 
authorities seized about 70 copies of former political prisoner 
sergei grigoryants glasnost journal last fall claiming they 
had been printed illegally at a governmentowned press 
in early may dissidents said police seized another 400 copies 
of grigoryants publications jailed the dissident leader for seven 
days and prevented his editorial office from hosting a meeting at 
which dissidents founded what they said is an alternative to the 
communist party 
meetings of that group the democratic union were followed 
closely by police but not broken up instead police detained dozens 
who came from outside moscow to the meetings and let them go after 
a short time 
dissidents and refuseniks planning demonstrations often are 
detained before they can get to the protest site those who manage 
to hoist protest banners often have them ripped up they are taken 
away by police but usually freed in a few hours 
sometimes protests are allowed to proceed peacefully like a 
refusenik demonstration on the steps of the moscow visa office in 
late april other protests such as one across from the foreign 
ministry building during the washington summit between reagan and 
gorbachev in december have been dispersed violently 
new laws in moscow and many other places make it possible to 
seek a permit for a legal demonstration but refuseniks and 
dissidents have found it is almost impossible to receive permission 
soviet authorities also are faced with another area of dissent 
that gorbachev has said could be the most serious the rise of 
national sentiments among some of the countrys more than 100 
ethnic groups 
serious ethnic unrest is known to have occurred in kazakhstan 
azerbaijan and armenia and there has been an increase in ethnic 
feelings in the baltic states 
gorbachev has called for a meeting of the policymaking 
communist party central committee to discuss the issue 
one armenian nationalist paryur ayrikyan has been arrested and 
is said to be under investigation for spreading false information 
about the soviet union that law is one of several used most 
frequently in the past against dissidents who say how authorities 
proceed against ayrikyan will tell them much about the official 
attitude in the future

all three sons were on their best 
behavior homemade berry liqueur had been poured neatly into seven 
tiny glasses and the table was resplendent with carefully crafted 
hors doeuvres of salted fish canned meats and pickled vegetables 
olga chuikov wife mother economist and communist party 
activist beamed with pride over the table spread lavishly for her 
family and the three strangers her friend lena invited for dinner 
with only a few hours warning 
smoothing the skirt of her crimson knit dress and nervously 
touching the cluster of curls neatly pinned on the crown of her 
head olga raised her glass 
what should we drink to asked the hostess searching her 
family and guests with expectant brown eyes theres so much we 
are hoping for its difficult to decide 
her neighbors and coworkers probably would say olga has 
everything she and viktor her husband of 15 years have a healthy 
family a fourroom apartment a red neva car and a summer cottage 
in the country they are as successful and thriving in soviet 
society as were ozzie and harriet or the cleavers the television 
families that celebrated american life in the 1960s 
a westerner like the american journalist brought over by olgas 
friend party secretary lena ivankovich might have guessed that 
olga hoped for material things a washing machine stereo or 
fashionable pair of shoes 
but the hostess a slender and attractive woman in her mid30s 
raised her glass and wished for her sons to grow up seeing 
americans as friends not enemies for the two governments to stop 
posturing and get down to the business of disarmament for a 
peaceful and wholesome future for her family 
so began a long night of storytelling and exploration that would 
teach the chuikovs about american lifestyles and give the american 
a glimpse of the concerns and values of a patriotic and 
hardworking siberian family 
olgas and viktors curiosity spills out in a flood of questions 
about everyday life in a land theyve always heard about but 
probably will never see 
i know our media often give a negative picture of life in 
america olga began diplomatically how do americans see us 
is it true that they think we are an aggressive society 
the level in the liqueur bottle dropped as the debate and 
laughter escalated and viktor produced a bottle of armenian cognac 
to sustain the conviviality into the early hours of morning the 
boys were told to go to bed but they stalled in the corners and 
doorways of the room fascinated by the exchange of lifestyle 
trivia 
how much does an american journalist earn each month how much 
does it cost for an apartment why do americans say disrespectful 
things about their president do the homeless and unemployed 
literally starve on the street or are there places where they can 
get help 
the questions themselves tell a lot about soviet life personal 
finances are as popular a subject of discussion as the weather and 
soviets dont hesitate to ask questions about salary savings or 
debt 
the chuikovs olga viktor the boys and olgas father vasily 
are comparatively well off for a soviet family together they 
have an income of more than 800 rubles a month about 1350 that 
is four times the wage of an average industrial worker and their 
apartment in the center of this siberian boomtown is spacious by 
any soviet standard 
living space is in extremely short supply and is distributed to 
families usually for life with the right to pass on an apartment 
as inheritance its not unusual for a family of four to be housed 
in a one or tworoom apartment and many rooms in soviet 
households serve as dining room living room and bedroom as the day 
progresses 
soviets pay about 3 percent of their salary for rent with the 
location and size of the living space playing little part in the 
pricing system 
the chuikovs were surprised to learn americans usually pay about 
one quarter of their monthly income for housing but they were even 
more intrigued that most middleclass working people live in 
separate homes rather than in apartments and that homes and 
apartments sometimes stand empty for months for want of a tenant or 
buyer 
suburban living perplexed them since homes on the outskirts of 
a city lack prestige in the soviet union even in the major cities 
the outer areas are seldom connected to municipal water heating or 
sewer systems outhouses and treks to community wells are daily 
facts of life within five miles of the moscow city limits 
food costs account for a greater share of the soviet familys 
budget than for americans the chuikovs calculated they were 
tickled by the concept of sprawling grocery stores where it takes 
an entire aisle to display all the different brands of coffee or 
breakfast cereal 
you just cant buy these things here olga said we built 
up our heavy industries after the war putting out farm equipment 
and industrial machines by the ton but we havent paid much 
attention to the things we need in everyday life 
the tugs of career and homemaking are felt by parents in both 
nations the women agreed with viktor and his male guests 
grudgingly conceding that the lot of the soviet working mother is a 
tough one 
does your husband cook for himself and shop for food olga 
wanted to know casting a reproving look at her husband 
soviet homes are devoid of the gadgets that get the american 
cook through a meal or the weekly laundry olga and lena are well 
educated and well read and had heard of microwave ovens but they 
shook their heads in wonder when told refrigerated leftovers could 
be reheated in five minutes 
free time and priorities for spending it further underscored 
differences between the two lifestyles soviet women spend an 
average of eight hours a day waiting in lines to buy food and 
performing the household chores still shunned by most men 
tynda however is spared much of the queuing that eats up spare 
time in other cities as the remote siberian base from which the 
baikalamur railroad is pushing east the town must truck in 
virtually everything it needs theres no need to search each 
store cabbage or an electric iron is either available or its not 
soviets generally are more culturally inclined than most 
americans standing in line for hours or cashing in on past favors 
to get tickets to the theater or symphony every book is a 
cherished possession and television is something they turn to for 
news rather than entertainment perhaps because programming is 
repetitive and of low quality 
as a mother i have to say i dont understand how americans can 
condone violence and antisovietism in films that children can 
see olga said how does this constitute freedom of speech 
rambo and rocky iv drew the traditional denunciations from the 
six adult soviets although none had seen either of the films 
the chuikovs said their 13yearold twins spend many 
afterschool hours in sports but that the shortage of consumer 
services that plagues most of the country is especially hard on 
siberians 
there are not enough music teachers so they can take only the 
most talented and unfortunately none of my children has 
distinguished himself olga lamented but all the same id 
like them to be musically literate 
school and work loomed only a few hours in the future so the 
smallscale cultural exchange drew to a reluctant close 
we hope we didnt tire you with so many questions olga 
said its just such a rare treat to see america through an 
americans eyes

the national party which made 
apartheid law in south africa this week marks 40 years of unbroken 
rule in that time it has helped create africas most modern state 
and one of the worlds most divided and ostracized nations 
on may 26 1948 to the surprise of its own afrikaner faithful 
the party won a narrow majority in the whitesonly parliament its 
subsequent hold on power is one of the longest ever among countries 
with multiparty elections 
the partys tactics and constituency have changed over the 
years but its primary objective remains constant to preserve the 
white minoritys political and economic paramountcy 
forty years of national party rule have brought us to a sorry 
state indeed wrote joyce harris former president of the black 
sash civil rights group in a recent article 
it has pursued its blinkered apartheid policy with no regard 
to its effects on the country and the vast majority of its people 
it has successfully followed a policy of divide and rule 
president pw botha the national partys leader since 1978 
says apartheid is an outdated concept now and is being 
dismantled in phases he and his loyalists depict the party as a 
proponent of racial reform using rhetoric that would have been 
heretical to nationalists 20 years ago 
the party still stresses however that its vision of 
powersharing does not include any scenario where blacks who make 
up 75 percent of the population could overrule whites on matters 
of vital national interest 
people officially classified as being asian or of mixed races 
now have their own parliament but all the major legislation 
resides with the white parliament 
the policy of slowpaced limited reform has induced large 
numbers of englishspeaking south africans to desert more liberal 
parties and support the national party 
but the talk of reform has driven an even larger number of 
proapartheid afrikaners into the ranks of the farright 
conservative party which emerged from the 1987 white election as 
the main opposition in parliament 
the national party is no longer the political arm of afrikaner 
nationalism says harald pakendorf a moderate afrikaner 
political columnist it and the conservative party have an almost 
equal share of support from afrikaners 
when the national party was formed in 1914 it was intended 
solely as a vehicle for promoting the interests of afrikaners the 
descendants of the dutch french and germans who settled in south 
africa in the 17th century 
today afrikaners make up 60 percent of the 5 million whites 
and their economic and educational levels are largely comparable to 
englishspeaking south africans but after losing to the british in 
the boer war 18991902 many afrikaners felt dominated culturally 
and politically by englishspeakers who as a whole were richer and 
better educated 
the hardcore nationalists stuck with the young party in 1934 
when many of its leaders formed a broadbased alliance with 
englishspeaking politicians under the banner of the united party 
entering the 1948 election the national party had 49 seats in 
the 153member parliament it campaigned on a platform of strict 
racial segregation and few experts believed it could oust the 
united party 
south africa broke away from the britishled commonwealth and 
declared itself a republic may 31 1961 this was a major issue for 
the national party and it narrowly won a referendum in october 
1960 with 52 percent of the voters supporting the breakaway 
but in what the star newspaper of johannesburg described at the 
time as a political convulsion the nationalists won a 
fiveseat majority df malan a stern former pastor became prime 
minster and established the first allafrikaner cabinet 
over the next few years the new government consolidated its 
powers through the allocation of civil service jobs to afrikaners 
and laid the legislative groundwork for apartheid 
by 1950 interracial sex and marriages had been banned and two 
of the laws that today form the cornerstones of apartheid had been 
enacted these are the group areas act which mandates segregated 
residential districts and the population registration act which 
requires racial classification of all south africans white 
black asian or colored mixed race

the goal explained national party policymakers was to 
eliminate friction between the races a separate education system 
was created and hundreds of thousands of blacks were forcibly 
moved to homelands where in theory they could practice limited 
selfgovernment 
the calling of this small nation is to give to the world the 
basis and pattern on which different races can live in peace and 
safety in the future each within its national circle said daan 
de wet a cabinet minister in 1959 
even before 1948 nonwhites freedoms were limited for 
example they could not vote or own farmland in white areas 
but only after 1948 were they restricted by a vast array of major 
and minor discriminatory laws that changed the siutation from de 
facto to legalized segregation 
in addition to the group areas act population registration act 
mixed marriages act the new government took numerous other steps 
under the separate amenities act of 1953 separate entrances were 
provided for whites in railway stations post offices and other 
government buildings special hospitals and beaches were set aside 
whites and nonwhites were forbidden to sit on the same benches in 
parks and at bus stops 
other national party laws formalized the segregation of trains 
and buses in the past five years there has been a trend toward 
desegregation affecting restaurants cinemas hotels but 
segregation both enforced and de facto remains pervasive 
edward perkins who in 1986 became the first black us 
ambassador to south africa has remarked that apartheid which in 
afrikaans means separateness has achieved its purpose 
the sad fact is that the policy of apartheid has been all too 
successful perkins said in december it ranks as one of this 
centurys most disastrous feats of social engineering 
critics of the national party acknowledge that 
governmentsanctioned racial discrimination was pervasive in south 
africa long before 1948 but joyce harris the former black sash 
leader argues that the nationalist takeover came at a time when 
western countries were becoming increasingly conscious of 
individual rights 
it was precisely then that south africa parted company with 
the western world and turned its face in the opposite direction 
she wrote at that time our country was a respected member of 
the western world and south africans could hold up their heads and 
walk with pride anywhere 
politically the highwater mark for the national party came in 
1977 when it gained 64 percent of the vote in the white election 
last year its share of the vote dropped to 52 percent but a 
favorable districting system enabled it to win 123 of the 166 
contested parliament seats for its 10th consecutive general 
election triumph 
despite the farrights extensive gains few political experts 
are predicting an early end to the national partys reign there is 
a widespread sense of irony in the perception that the partys 
future now hinges on its ability to coopt blacks rather than 
isolate them 
botha himself touched on this matter in april when he proposed 
black participation in cabinetlevel policymaking 
if the white people do not wish to follow my way it is their 
responsibility he said if they follow the way of 
confrontation it is their problem

carolco not only brought heman actor sylvester stallone to the 
role and rambo to the screen it also controls movie and video 
rights to the series and sells the right to make rambo 
paraphernalia to producers of toys weapons and the like 
rambo has been good to carolco 
in worldwide ticket sales alone the first rambo movie earned 
120 million and the second is closing on 300 million according 
to kathryn linclau carolcos vice president for marketing 
analysts say rambo iii will make at least 160 million at 
the box office in the united states alone and thats before the 
profits start rolling in from videocassette and television rights 
and the fees from some 70 licenses for rambo products 
for fans who cant afford the topofthe line replica of the 
knife vietnam vet john rambo uses to dispatch his foes on his new 
foray into sovietdominated afghanistan there will be a stainless 
steel version for 1000 and a utilitarian version for 125 
new this year will be rambo trading units gold and silver 
survival currency 5 10 and 20 denominations selling for 59 
to 598 said danny simon whos in charge of licensing for carolco 
and yes linclau added rambo iv will be a reality 
on all its operations last year carolco made a profit of 114 
million on sales of 364 million and most of that rode in on 
rambos broad shoulders 
stallone has his own production company for the rocky movies 
and other ventures but carolco owns rambo and the star is on 
the payroll in a big way 
stallone reportedly gets 16 million plus a piece of the 
almostcertain profit from rambo iii 
but thats money well spent according the jeffrey logsdon an 
analyst who follows show business for the los angeles investment 
company crowell weedon amp co 
he is really playing the role of writer director star and 
creative consultant logsdon said when you have that kind of 
bankable talent youre going to have to pay a premium 
production costs traditionally are made public only through 
informed speculation and the trade paper daily variety pegs 
rambo iii at 63 million carolco president peter hoffman 
called the estimate high but refused to give another figure 
logsdon suggests rambo iii likely cost 57 million or 58 
million to make those estimates put rambo iii among the most 
expensive movies of all time 
war and peace made in 1966 cost 100 million in 1966 
dollars according to the los angeles times while more recent 
nonadjusted figures include those for annie 1982 515 
million cotton club 1984 51 million and ishtar 
1987 45 million 
carolco which first sold stock to the public in november 1986 
is truly the house that rambo built but management is trying with 
mixed success to add a few new rooms 
the company produced such boxoffice yawns as extreme 
prejudice with nick nolte and powers booth and angel heart 
noted chiefly for a controversial nude scene between mickey rourke 
and tvs cosby kid lisa bonet 
they werent great successes in america linclau 
acknowledged but on the international level they were 
profitable 
in the last year carolco has bought orbis communications a tv 
distribution and advertising sales company indieprod co maker of 
the movies footloose and roxanne and international video 
entertainment a distributor of videocassettes 
carolco is bringing out another action film this summer red 
heat starring arnold schwarzenegger and jim belushi 
theyre doing all the right things becoming less dependent on 
one rambo film every three years logsdon said but theres no 
one in hollywood who doesnt envy them over that franchise

ben okri first came to england in 1978 eager to 
experience the land of shakespeare and dickens two writers in a 
literary tradition he had long admired 
a decade and three books later the 29yearold nigerian writer 
is broadening that tradition okri represents the artistic 
dividends britain has reaped from its days of spreading its empire 
and language throughout the world 
indeed any literary critic listing the five greatest living 
british writers would certainly include trinidadborn vs naipaul 
especially after his latest acclaimed best seller the enigma of 
arrival 
however this multicultural vibrancy is not new such writers as 
nobelist wole soyinka chinua achebe and samuel selvon have been on 
the scene for more than 20 years opening readers eyes to the 
ethnic problems far removed from the domestic bourgeois subject 
matter often favored by anglosaxon writers 
what is new is the quantity of these socalled commonwealth 
artists sons and daughters of the almost vanished empire and 
their increased visibility 
around 1960 the nigerianborn soyinka was testing the london 
theater fringe with the swamp dweller and the trials of 
brother jero in 1986 he won the nobel prize for literature the 
first black african to receive the honor 
achebe first won attention in 1958 with things fall apart a 
tribal tragedy set in his native nigeria which has sold more than 2 
million copies last year after a 20year break from writing his 
anthills of the savannah was nominated for the booker prize 
britains most prestigious literary award 
these older novelists are gaining numerous younger counterparts 
including okri and buchi emecheta from africa salman rushdie and 
vikram seth from india timothy mo from hong kong and caryl 
phillips olive senior and derek walcott from the west indies 
with the contributions of such artists as the 
playwrightscreenwriter hanif kureishi and actors ben kingsley art 
malik roshan seth and victor banerjee english cultures debt to 
the commonwealth is growing 
were looking at a world movement which covers every 
conceivable theme alistair niven literature director at 
londons arts council said in an interview one has to abandon 
the notion of the anglosaxon tradition were trying to 
internationalize the view of literature in this country 
theres a growing awareness of these nations as nations in 
their own right and also of the presence in england of a great many 
people of caribbean and african origin said lyn innes senior 
lecturer in english and afrocaribbean studies at the university of 
kent at canterbury one of a dozen british universities offering 
commonwealth literature courses 
where commonwealth literature was once relegated to small 
presses and limited print runs it is now snapped up by mainstream 
publishers and movie dealers and is alo receiving recognition from 
the academic community 
indianborn salman rushdie 40 won the 1981 booker prize for 
his magical panoramic novel midnights children about 
indias transition from colony to independence he reportedly 
received a 1496 million advance for his next novel the satanic 
verses to be released in september 
mos novel sour sweet set among londons chinese 
community has been made into a 362 million movie his best 
seller an insular possession about the british in hong kong 
made the 1987 booker list 
tim cribb director of english studies at cambridges churchill 
college is leading a drive to raise 78 million for a chair in 
commonwealth studies 
many of the new novels deal with the disillusionment 
commonwealth immigrants suffer when they run into racism in britain 
tanzanianborn abdulrazak gurnah a faculty member at the 
university of kent has just published pilgrims way the novel 
tells of an african immigrant named daud who is drawn to britain 
the torch of wisdom and learning encountering persistent 
racism he finds his own small personal triumph in a crushing 
victory by the west indian cricket team over england 
the theme echoes sam selvons 1956 the lonely londoners 
whose main character a trinidadian comes to london only to 
discover that the home capital he had envisioned is in truth a 
strange place on another planet 
in disparities an okri short story a nigerian immigrant is 
forced to sleep in subway stations and scavenge discarded yogurt 
containers he finds london a damn poxy place and its gentility 
an uneasy yoking of lies 
some commonwealth novels chart the sociological and identity 
changes wrought by the end of empire 
caryl phillips in a state of independence describes 
bertram francis returning to his newly independent west indian 
island after a 20year absence and finding himself an alien 
naipauls the enigma of arrival on the other hand is an elegy 
to the passing of the old england 
nirad c chaudhuris autobiographical thy hand great 
anarch is a paean to western civilization whose controversial 
thesis is that india gained nothing by britains departure 
some english writers say they are spurred on by the blazing 
assuredness of their commonwealth colleagues and their looser 
prose which is rooted in an oral storytelling tradition 
there are a number of people age 55 down to 30 who have 
created a strong presence which has given me and other writers a 
sense of british literature being global not just insular says 
author margaret drabble 
london now is one of the most cosmopolitan most transcultural 
cities in the world its very hard not to want to write about 
that 
the commonwealth presence is also felt in the performing arts 
where attitudes are less open 
rita wolf the bengali who starred in my beautiful 
laundrette complains that despite her experience she has 
difficulty getting work art malik the 35yearold angloasian 
actor is only now beginning to get cast in nonethnic roles 
following his compelling performance as the wronged hari kumar in 
the hit tv series the jewel in the crown 
the problem is that in the minority area every actor is a 
minority of one whether he be fat thin chinese a woman malik 
said if youre going to say we are a cosmopolitan society you 
have to go one step further 
more often commonwealth actors are expected to conform to 
stereotypes even if a few such as the academy awardwinner ben 
kingsley have built a career on uncompromising portrayals that 
honor their own visions 
in 1985 kingsley who is halfindian played othello in a royal 
shakespeare company production as the robed north african rather 
than as the conventional elocutionary englishman in blackface he 
won his oscar for his portrayal of gandhi 
there are certain sensibilities in this country that i to my 
dying day will never reeducate kingsley said all i can take 
with me is my version of the truth

what sir edmund hillary recalls most 
vividly about standing at the top of mount everest 35 years ago is 
the ice prickly biting slivers of ice billowing around like a 
white halo 
they bore into your face cutting and tingling he said 
and exhilarating 
on may 29 1953 hillary and the sherpa guide tenzing norgay 
became the first men to conquer the worlds tallest mountain 
neither hillary nor norgay who died in 1986 ever said who got 
there first 
we reached it together thats all hillary said in an 
interview abruptly ending any further discussion of the question 
since their ascent 202 men and women have followed them up the 
massive 29028foot mountain on the border of nepal and tibet 
to many everest symbolizes the literal and figurative high 
point of a mountaineers career 
but hillary views it as a beginning rather than the end of 
adventurous activity 
it won the new zealander a knighthood from queen elizabeth ii 
more important he said it earned him the financial backing to 
climb scores of other peaks in the himalayan chain to trek to the 
south pole and even to go off on a lark an unfruitful quest for 
yeti the legendary abominable snowman 
hillary now 68 now spends much of his time behind desks in the 
capitals of india nepal and bangladesh as new zealands ambassador 
to all three countries 
although his broad shoulders and 6foot3inch frame suggest he 
could still take on everest he holds to trekking hiking and other 
loweraltitude sports 
im finding the hills are getting steeper he said 
friends including the indian teenagers he has led on 
whitewater rafting trips and the tribal sherpa children he visits 
at mountain schools call him sir ed 
born edmund percival hillary in auckland on july 20 1919 he 
spent a good deal of his childhood reading adventure books and 
daydreaming 
there was a phase when i was the fastest gun in the west 
another when i explored the antarctic hillary said i would 
walk for hours with my mind drifting to all these things 
there wasnt much money available in his family for adventure 
however his father a newspaper editorturnedbeekeeper was 
energetic and very active but never very good at making money 
hillary took up skiing in high school but didnt try climbing 
until he was 19 or 20 his first summit was the 7500foot mount 
olivier in southern new zealand 
it wasnt a difficult mountain by any manner or means but 
making it through the snow to the ridge then along the ridge and 
up to the summit really captured me hillary recalled it was 
then that i resolved i was going to do a lot more mountains and i 
did 
hillary was already a veteran of numerous indian himalayan peaks 
when he was asked to join a british expedition in 1951 to the 
everest region the reconnaissance team explored the khumbu glacier 
and an ice fall in the shadow of the great mountain 
we were the first to realize there was a potential route up 
everest from the south side he said 
two years later he and norgay and 11 others set out with the 
british everest expedition on that route hillary was 33 at the 
time norgay 38 at least 14 expeditions before them had failed 
hillary said their equipment was less sophisticated than the 
gear available now although they had early nylon ropes and oxygen 
cylinders they struggled with primitive metalspiked clampons for 
their boots and ice axes that lacked the curve that facilitates 
vertical climbing nowadays 
there was also a psychological barrier physicians had warned 
us that even if we got to the top with oxygen we might collapse 
and die because of the thin air 
just short of the summit hillary and norgay hit what appeared 
to be an insurmountable obstacle a vertical rock step 40 feet 
high maneuvering carefully they found a crack where the ice was 
breaking away from the rock and eased their way up the spot is 
known to mountaineers today as hillarys step 
hillary says he is most often asked if reaching the summit was 
accompanied by some religious or spiritual experience 
for me no hillary said it was mostly a sense of 
satisfaction and surprise actually norgay he said was more 
emotional 
i shook his hand hillary recalled he threw his arms 
around my shoulders and gave me a tremendous hug later norgay 
a buddhist buried bits of candy and biscuits in the snow as a 
gift to the gods hillary said 
atop everest hillary said he quickly found his attention 
turning to other unconquered peaks with the ice particles cutting 
into his face and frosting his cheeks he scanned nearby makalu 
peak 27807 feet and worked out a climbing route 
hillary failed in an attempt on makalu in 1954 but a french 
team made it up several years later 
if his vocation today is diplomacy and the outdoors his 
avocation is working to improve the lot of the poor sherpa 
tribesmen who live in the hills below everest 
since 1961 he has raised about 200000 a year to build 
schools hospitals and water systems for the sherpas of nepal 
the effort has cost him more than time and energy his wife 
louise and 16yearold daughter belinda were killed in a plane 
crash in 1975 en route to join him at one of his sherpa hospitals 
his son peter 33 of melbourne australia makes his living as 
a ski instructor and mountaineer peter has failed twice in efforts 
to climb everest a daughter sarah 31 is an art restorer in 
auckland 
thirteen people have climbed everest more than once including 
the nepali sungdare sherpa who has been to the top four times 
but hillary said he never had any desire to repeat the trip 
there were so many other mountains

the view from the flight deck had not 
changed all day mile after mile of gray sky gray water and not a 
fishing boat in sight 
the fourengine c130 its huge fuel tanks running low finally 
turned and headed for land 
that was a perfectly boring patrol said joseph koczur jr 
a national marine fisheries service agent 
well we learned where they arent the copilot coast 
guard lt cmdr mike flood said with a shrug 
chalk up another frustrating day for the fish cops of the 
bering sea who fight a losing battle guarding the nations richest 
deepwater fishery against raids by an elusive foreign fleet 
this first leg of a twoday patrol covered a slice of ocean half 
the size of kentucky and for the number of foreign vessels seen 
thats where the patrol may as well have been keeping the c130 
airborne for the day cost taxpayers 27000 
its a big ocean adm paul yost the coast guards 
commandant said from his washington office its like searching 
for a needle in a haystack 
this year its like searching with one eye closed deficit 
reduction measures have cut back on fishery patrols four years 
ago a c130 would take off daily from the coast guards base on 
kodiak island now its more like once a week 
american fishermen say the cuts come at a bad time just as 
theyre finally claiming an area congress made theirs in 1976 by 
extending us jurisdiction to 200 miles offshore and foreign 
fleets are not being polite about leaving the fishing grounds they 
pioneered decades ago 
by some estimates foreign boats in the bering sea are illegally 
catching up to 1 billion in fish each year twice the amount 
caught legally by americans biologists worry that such poaching 
combined with unregulated fishing just outside the us zone may 
threaten fish stocks 
if a scale big enough could be found the bering seas hoard of 
fish would weigh in at more than 30 billion pounds a huge 
swimming feedlot that is 65 percent alaska pollock and 35 percent 
pacific cod yellowfin sole sablefish and a smattering of other 
species collectively known as bottomfish they provide an annual 
catch worth more than all other us deepwater fisheries combined 
for years bottomfish were ignored by american fishermen seeking 
salmon and crab foreigners mainly japanese koreans soviets and 
poles valued the fish more highly starting in the 1940s they 
fished these distant waters with huge trawlers depleting stocks of 
some slowgrowing species by the early 1960s 
management improved in 1976 when the us fishery conservation 
and management act established the 200mile zone the act also 
created the north pacific fishery management council to regulate 
harvests 
americans were given first shot at the bottomfish but they had 
neither the capital needed to build processing plants nor a market 
for the finished product by 1981 foreign boats still accounted 
for 93 percent of the bering sea bottomfish harvest 
recently more americans have joined the bottomfish boom some 
are drawn by a keener us appetite for fish and by worldwide price 
increases others their crab boats idled by a drop in alaska crab 
populations just want to stay in business 
the fishery council has doled out progressively smaller catch 
quotas to the foreign fleet this year for the first time 
american fishermen will catch all the fish within the 200mile 
limit although 60 percent are still sold to foreign processing 
ships 
foreign fishermen have been relegated to a triangle of high seas 
known as the doughnut hole a 45000squaremile pocket formed 
by the boundaries of the us 200mile zone on the east and south 
and the soviet convention line on the west 
the foreign catch of pollock in the doughnut hole has soared 
from just over 4000 metric tons in 1982 to an estimated 1 million 
tons last year thats close to the pollock catch allowed in the 
rest of the bering sea 
in addition to producing this legal catch the doughnut hole has 
become in the words of alaska republican sen ted stevens a 
haven for bandits 
just as fish ignore political boundaries so do some foreign 
fishermen theyve been fishing the bering sea since the end of 
world war ii said nmfs agent koczur if they want to come in 
and find fish they know where to go 
on the second day of koczurs mission the c130 reached the 
patrol area and descended to 1500 feet cockpit radar showed a 
bright green dot 40 miles beyond the limit dead ahead soon the 
radar screen filled with dots

the plane descended to 600 feet and the boats became visible 
dozens crowded into a few square miles it dropped still lower to 
200 feet and roared by the rigging of a rusty old boat with its 
net in the water 
koczur recorded the vessels call number and fellow nmfs agent 
kenneth hansen snapped a picture it was a large soviet stern 
trawler koczur said 
for 90 minutes the pilots yanked and banked the plane lining 
up one boat after another for photographs information collected 
for files and future patrols on some turns it seemed a wing might 
dip into the ocean 
the navigator said he felt ill the reporter turned pale pilot 
and copilot chatted about eating raw fish and hansen and koczur 
kept snapping away they counted 56 boats in all a mix of 
japanese soviet and polish trawlers 
the boats continued to fish knowing they were perfectly legal 
40 miles into the international waters of the doughnut hole 
koczur wondered aloud where the boats had been hours earlier 
officials suspect foreign vessels use cover of darkness and storms 
to sneak into us waters fishermen have been known to duck into a 
squall when they know the law is close and boats have been spotted 
with canvas tarps over their identifying numbers 
coast guard efforts in this catandmouse game have had limited 
success since august 1986 15 foreign vessels have been detected 
fishing illegally in the 200mile zone yost said patrols have 
spotted hundreds more but unless a boat has its net in the water 
it is considered legal 
that is frustrating koczur said we dont know theyre 
fishing but why else would they be out there 
why indeed an angry sam hjelle asked last winter hjelle the 
seattlebased owner of a bering sea trawler met with the coast 
guard last december to discuss illegal foreign fishing he left the 
meeting in disgust and shortly afterward he and other fishermen 
tried their own remedy 
on jan 12 hjelle and ted evans executive director of the 
alaska factory trawlers association chartered a twinengine plane 
for a twoday fishing expedition 
the fish vigilantes came back 17000 poorer but they got what 
they were looking for videotapes of seven japanese vessels 
allegedly fishing in us waters 
the tapes created an uproar just as hjelle and evans had hoped 
the senate passed a resolution condemning illegal fishing and 
urging a moratorium on doughnut hole fishing the state department 
demanded an explanation from the japanese government and the 
commerce department fined three japanese companies 100000 
soviet and american negotiators last month renewed talks to 
consider closing the doughnut hole to fishing a delicate issue 
involving international law since neither country has jurisdiction 
over the area 
the negotiators have asked other fishing nations to consider a 
moratorium but the response has been weak especially from japan 
a fishhungry nation thats seen traditional worldwide fishing 
grounds shut off by nations declaring 200mile limits 
japan has a long history in the bering sea long before the 
economic zone was claimed by americans said katsuo jodai of the 
japan fisheries association the doughnut hole is high seas 
it does not belong to any country 
so the catandmouse game continues and the mice have a greater 
advantage than ever 
in march yost announced that c130 patrols from kodiak would be 
cut by 35 percent cutter patrols by 55 percent yost he hopes an 
interim funding measure working its way through congress will boost 
patrols this summer but theres no guarantee of funding for next 
year 
the state department meanwhile awaits a reply from the 
japanese on januarys illegal fishing the companies fined by the 
commerce department have yet to pay and their troublesome boats 
after dropping off their catch in hokkaido returned to fish the 
bering sea

hunched over the steering wheel 
dressed in rubber boots and jeans paul fuhs guided his bouncing 
mudspattered truck along a rutted road past docks crowded with 
fishing vessels 
its the most highly sophisticated fishing fleet in the 
world he boasted waving toward the boats theres nothing 
like this anywhere else 
fuhs 39 an expert in underwater explosives is the unpaid 
mayor and chief booster of unalaska a hotbed of high technology 
high finance and high hopes 
the aleutian village with a permanent population of about 
1900 is awash in a wave of bering sea bottomfishing boom time 
us vessels along with cargo and processing ships from at least 
14 other nations crowd 80 square miles of harbor jockeying to get 
to 15 docks 
in the first two weeks of the year we turned away 114 ships 
fuhs said this has got to be the most exciting place in the 
world right now 
most of the bustle is centered on dutch harbor located about 
800 miles southwest of anchorage on tiny amaknak island it is part 
of the town of unalaska on the larger sheltering unalaska island 
fuhs spends much of his time trying to persuade the state to 
pump money into his windswept community to cash in on the boom 
instead of asking dutch where bottom what 
the entire state would benefit he says if the fishing 
industrys focus shifted north from pacific northwest ports 
the state has no policy on bottomfishing fuhs said 
seattle has a strategy japan has a strategy everybody has a 
strategy but us here we are a tiny little town in the middle of 
nowhere and its fallen in our laps the bering sea could be a 
perpetual prudhoe bay if we manage it properly 
fuhs says state officials urge unalaska to seek private 
investment but private investors while indicating willingness to 
build 60 million in warehouses cold storage and processing 
plants first want the town to upgrade its sewer and water lines 
and build a bigger dock 
for that fuhs says the town needs state money we want 
gruntlevel infrastructure we dont want a performing arts 
center 
city manager nancy gross says needed improvements in the world 
war iiera water system alone could cost an estimated 30 million 
much of the system is built of woodstave pipes which leak an 
estimated 80 percent of the water pumped through them 
the needs are just enormous she said ten years ago this 
was a town of 500 to 600 people with very little industry 
unalaska unfortunately needs money at a time when slumping oil 
prices have squeezed the budget gov steve cowper managed to find 
17 million for unalaska sewer improvements in the last days of 
the legislative session 
harbormaster gary daily believes the problem may be unalaskas 
remoteness the same thing that gives us our advantage works 
against us he said theres a lot of ignorance about whats 
going on out here 
out here is a frontier of sorts where fists brains and 
hard work win respect unalaska has no fulltime dentist no 
plumber no appliance repair service no doctor and no veterinarian 
to deal with scores of freeroaming mutts 
milk costs 499 a gallon a bottle of jack daniels sour mash 
whiskey that sells for 20 in anchorage goes for 3950 here 
softball and basketball are serious pursuits and eagles are as 
plentiful as vultures fighting for space in the rigging of docked 
vessels 
almost any language can be heard on the street 
the soviets are a favorite because they spend buckets on 
stereos gum solarpowered watches and nobody knows why plastic 
baby bottles and they are enthusiastic merrymakers they get 
down and boogie daily said 
thirtyfive soviet vessels docked at dutch harbor last year 40 
are expected this year 
men outnumber women 51 drugs liquor and brawling are problems 
these guys make a lot of money and there is nothing to do 
here said 48yearold pete davis chief of the eightman police 
force if theyre so inclined they can stick it up their nose or 
pour it down their throats eightyfive percent of our work is 
because of booze or drugs 
on the islands the mountains wade into the sea flat land goes 
at a premium there are 30odd miles of carkilling dirt roads and 
a 3900foot heartstopping gravel runway for planes 
if it rains there is mud if not choking dust 
and there is money lots of money 
the bering sea fisheries salmon crab and bottom fish 
generate 13 billion to 23 billion a year fishermen get about 
400 million of that with the rest going for the myriad services 
needed to keep boats afloat 
only a few years ago unalaska was dead in the water in 1982 
for reasons still not understood stocks of red king crabs were 
decimated the harvest plummeted to 3 million pounds from a 1980 
peak of 130 million the 1983 season was canceled 
the bottomfishing industry was then mostly in foreign hands but 
american fishermen turned to these lessvalued fish to make a 
living aided by congress 1976 act establishing a 200mile us 
coastal zone 
some say the crab crash may have been a blessing in disguise for 
unalaska king crab was real seasonal said kathy grimnes 
president of ounalashka the aleut regional ative corporation 
workers labored 14 hours a day seven days a week 
it was so busy you didnt have time to think she said 
the crash sort of put things on hold and allowed people to 
evaluate their community 
since then unalaska has put in parks and sponsored cultural 
events there is a bookstore the school with 150 students from 
kindergarten through senior high boasts an olympicsized swimming 
pool 
but the boom makes some residents fear that part of unalaska is 
dying 
jim bacus drives a battered taxi we cant drive our 
threewheelers anymore he said they used to let this dog 
sleep on the floor of the elbow room now when dogs wander in they 
chase them out theres too many rules now 
grimnes corporation a land development company is busy 
planning a 50acre industrial park and may build a 5 million 
900foot dock but grimnes admits something may be fading 
it used to be that everybody used to wave to each other she 
said now we dont

long before joseph mccarthys attacks on 
communists in the state department long before julius and ethel 
rosenberg were executed as spies and long before winston churchill 
warned that an iron curtain had split east from west the house 
committee on unamerican activities was rooting out communism in 
america 
in the process it also smeared the reputations of many innocent 
people turned friend on friend and attempted to twist the fifth 
amendment guarantee against selfincrimination into an admission of 
communist affiliation 
the committee will take its place in american history as a 
moment of shame and hallucination says historian arthur 
schlesinger jr 
born 50 years ago on may 26 1938 huac as the headlinewriters 
called it was the brainchild of a jewish congressman from new york 
who feared that adolf hitlers persecution of german jews would in 
groups like the american bund make their way to the new world 
rep samuel dickstein dny proposed that the group be formed 
to hunt nazis not communists but from the beginning congressmen 
who sat on the committee sought out fellow travelers comsymps 
and cardcarrying communists ironically the antisemitism 
that dickstein so feared permeated even the halls of congress the 
man who envisaged the committee was never seated on it 
the committee originally subject to annual approval became a 
fixture in january 1945 and lived on for another 30 years it went 
after labor unions hollywood personalities and opponents of the 
vietnam war in its most celebrated case it brought down alger 
hiss an ontherise new dealer who had once been a law clerk to 
supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes and raised the 
fortunes of a young republican congressman from california richard 
nixon 
in 1975 congress abolished huac the panels name had been 
changed to the house internal security committee but its time 
had passed 
in the beginning though the nations mood was different there 
were fascists and communists in the country which was slowly 
trying to pick itself up from the depression 
at huacs first hearing in august 1938 chairman martin dies a 
texas democrat made a promise that committee critics never forgot 
we shall be fair and impartial at all times and treat every 
witness with fairness and courtesy dies promised this 
committee will not permit any character assassination or any 
smearing of innocent people it is easy to smear someones name 
or reputation by unsupported charges or an unjustified attack but 
it is difficult to repair the damage that has been done 
yet no sooner did the committee begin its work than it began to 
do exactly what dies promised it wouldnt 
in the days that followed observers began to wonder whether 
the lady of breeding who had made such a dignified entrance into 
town was in fact setting up a bawdy house walter goodman wrote 
in his history of huac the commitee 
huac immediately launched an attack on the federal theater and 
writers project a new deal program that seemed frivolous even to 
some supporters of franklin d roosevelt when so many americans 
were unemployed and hungry 
the committee also had the facts on its side there were 
communists in the federal theater in june 1939 congress abolished 
the project 
the committee turned its attention over the next few years to 
labor unions and hollywood but for the most part took a back seat 
to world war ii once america had entered the conflict 
it picked up with renewed vigor though after the war ended as 
the fear of communism became more widespread in the united states 
the soviet union no longer a us ally quickly expanded its 
influence country after country in eastern europe fell under the 
domination of sovietbacked communist parties 
churchill warned in 1946 from stettin in the baltic to 
trieste in the adriatic an iron curtain has descended across the 
continent allowing police government to rule eastern europe 
the image became a metaphor for the time and americans caught by 
surprise by this new cold war began to see the world in terms of 
them vs us ccommunist vs american 
and what could be more unamerican than a former communist 
in the united states who served as a symbolic link with soviet 
aggression abroad 
none stood out more than whittaker chambers and alger hiss 
their drama played out in the huac hearing room and on 
chambers farm in rural westminster md came to symbolize the 
divisions within the country 
hiss then and even now in his new book recollections of a 
life maintained that he was innocent and victimized by enemies 
of the new deal chambers presented himself as the last hope of the 
west 
their story began in july 1948 when chambers a rumply senior 
editor at time magazine testified to huac that hiss had been a 
member of the communist party in the 1930s 
some of the other alleged communists named by chambers had 
admitted their past affiliation but not the tall and lean hiss 
who had worked at the state department and then as president of the 
carnegie endowment for international peace hiss immediately denied 
chambers charges and asked the committee for a chance to deny them 
under oath 
hiss made such an impressive appearance that nixon was the only 
committee member to question his denial nixon questioned hiss 
secretly in new york and paid several visits to chambers farm 
and at a ninehour hearing on aug 25 1948 the most dramatic 
and crowded event in the committees history nixon and others 
pressed hiss hard for details of his past hiss was careful 
prefacing more than 200 answers with to be best of my 
recollection 
still there was nothing to show that hiss had been involved in 
any spying then in november 1948 chambers delivered to the 
justice department 65 typed pages of copies or summaries of state 
department documents and three memos in hiss handwriting he 
stashed two strips of developed microfilm and three cylinders of 
undeveloped microfilm in a hollowedout pumpkin on his maryland 
farm 
a few days later with a blast of publicity huac investigators 
found the pumpkin and the microfilm and on dec 15 hiss was 
indicted on two counts of perjury he was convicted in 1950 and 
sentenced to five years in prison 
the hiss case helped launch nixons career not long afterward 
dwight eisenhower picked the young republican as his vice president 
the case also played an unintended role in furthering the 
fortunes of wisconsin sen joseph mccarthy making it easier for 
him to exaggerate the dimensions of the internal communist menace

huac turned its attention in the early 1950s to hollywood its 
stated reason was the suspicion that the communists were sneaking 
propaganda into the movies joseph rauh jr who represented the 
writers arthur miller and lillian hellman in their appearances 
before the committee said in a recent interview that he believes 
the committees real motivation was publicity 
how would you get publicity rauh asked youd get it by 
getting famous people in front of you when it was rumored that 
arthur miller was going to marry marilyn monroe he was subpoenaed 
by the committee he wasnt subpoeaned after he wrote one of the 
best plays of this century death of a salesman 
ronald reagan who served as president of the screen actors 
guild told the committee in 1951 i abhor their communists 
philosophy but i detest their tactics which are those of a fifth 
column and are dishonest the presidents anticommunist rhetoric 
has continued even as he prepares for a trip to moscow and his 
fourth summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev 
among others testifying during those years were director elia 
kazan writer and performer abe burrows playwright clifford odets 
and actor zero mostel many of the hollywood witnesses exercised 
their fifth amendment right not to incriminate themselves 
for the committee taking the fifth was considered an 
acknowledgement that one was a communist if you had nothing to 
hide panel members reasoned why take the fifth 
those who did refuse to answer the committees questions were in 
danger of being cited for contempt of congress 
kazan opted to tell all he knew he not only confessed that he 
had been a member of the communist party briefly in 193435 but 
named others he knew had belonged as well odets named names too 
kazan promoting his new book elia kazan a life said in a 
recent interview on nbctvs today show that he debated 
whether he should identiy others who had belonged to the communist 
party 
i went one way and swung the other and it was a very hard 
decision to make but i thought the congress has an absolute 
right to investigate anything like that anything like the 
communist party in this country he said 
kazan had directed two of millers plays all my sons and 
death of a salesman after he testified he never directed 
another work by his longtime friend 
hellman in 1952 tried another tack 
rauh recalled that hellman said she couldnt name names and 
she couldnt go to jail because she was not the kind of person who 
could survive in jail 
she said she was perfectly willing to talk about herself but 
the problem was that if she did talk about herself she waived the 
privilege against selfincrimination 
rauh said they worked out an arrangment whereby hellman would 
write a letter to the committee explaining that she would waive the 
fifth amendment if the committee would not ask her about other 
people 
to hurt innocent people whom i knew many years ago in order to 
save myself is to me inhuman and indecent and dishonorable i 
cannot and will not cut my conscience to fit this years 
fashions she wrote 
the committee did not like hellmans stance but never pursued 
her further 
the hollywood investigations marked the end of huacs heyday 
the events that followed the 1953 death of josef stalin who had 
ruled the soviet union with an iron fist for 24 years the senates 
1954 censure of mccarthy and the end of the korean war in 1955 
set in motion the committees demise 
huacs last stand in a sense came in the late 1960s and early 
1970s when it held public hearings on antiwar groups and such 
terrorists as the symbionese liberation army 
richard ichord then a democratic congressman from missouri was 
chairman of the committee he recalled that by the late 1960s huac 
didnt have the support it commanded after world war ii the 
russian bear had become a bugbear 
in 1975 less than six months after nixon was forced out of the 
presidency by watergate the house reorganized the structure of 
various committees 
rep don edwards dcalif introduced the resolution in the 
house democratic caucus to abolish the committee im happy to 
say that my motion passed he said i never saw such a fast 
hammer in my life 
and on jan 14 the full house gave its assent in a final 
irony the house voted to transfer jurisdiction to the civil and 
constitutional rights subcommittee of the house judiciary committee 
the subcommittee the liberal edwards headed 
we hold the hearings in the right way on civil rights and 
civil liberties edwards said huac was a kangaroo court it 
acted as an investigator prosecutor judge and jury of men and 
women whose political social and economic views the committee 
thought were contemptible 
ichord said he is disappointed that the judiciary committee has 
not continued to root out communists 
i dont think the russians have changed their views i 
still believe that the soviet union is using international 
communism in an endeavor to seek world hegemony 
so the debate over huac continues 13 years after its death 
as the journalist edward r murrow said in his 1954 broadcast 
that brought the downfall of mccarthy he didnt create this 
situation of fear he merely exploited it and rather successfully 
cassius was right the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but 
in ourselves

in his important new book on government 
surveillance of prominent authors and artists herbert mitgang 
constructs the ludicrous image of gmen tailing playwright lillian 
hellman while enemy spies gather intelligence on american military 
strength and strategy 
j edgar hoover himself took a personal interest in miss 
hellmans activities mitgang observes in dangerous dossiers 
exposing the secret war against americas greatest authors 
donald i fine inc 1895 
in a letter written to the fbi special agent in new york in 
1943 in the middle of world war ii when nazi agents and the 
germanamerican bund were operating in the united states hoover 
called for a comprehensive report on her 
the scene might be laughable were it not for the questionable 
use of manpower with the nations very security in jeopardy that 
it suggests 
dangerous dossiers is firstclass journalism as well as 
essential documentation on the history and nature of creative 
freedom in the united states 
this writer mitgang notes in the concluding chapter does 
not believe that authors are wiser or more talented than any other 
creators in this country nor should they be singled out as 
privileged characters 
however there is one major difference that distinguishes the 
role played by the press literature and printing from other 
professions the framers of the constitution built the first 
amendment guarantee of freedom of expression without abridgment 
of any kind into the democratic structure of the new republic 
dangerous dossiers represents a long and sometimes 
frustrating effort by mitgang cultural correspondent for the new 
york times to test the vitality of that guarantee by examining 
fbi cia and other government files on prominent writers including 
nobel laureates ernest hemingway john steinbeck and william 
faulkner using the freedom of information act 
mitgang is the author of four biographies four novels and 10 
other works of nonfiction including two books and a play on the 
life of abraham lincoln 
he began his inquiry by asking for previously secret government 
records on poet and fellow lincoln biographer carl sandburg that 
produced an army intelligence file of six pages and an fbi dossier 
containing 23 censored pages 
it wasnt hard he says of the enterprise it was just a 
long wait 
most of the material was heavily censored generally to protect 
the government informants and efforts to obtain the blackedout 
material generally were futile 
though some of the targets of government observation might with 
good reason ridicule the extreme effort economistdiplomat john 
kenneth galbraith was thought to be the disciple of an unidentified 
subversive called dr ware the result of a misunderstanding by 
an agent who heard galbraiths views described as doctrinaire 
many others mitgang says suffered 
steinbeck attempted to join the army during world war ii 
mitgang recalls at the very same time that he was writing 
speeches for president roosevelt and for the head of the air force 
he was good enough to do that but he was not allowed to 
become a second lieutenant in the army because the fbi had 
specifically attacked him as something close to a red because of 
the grapes of wrath which was considered a subversive book 
many of the dozens of novelists and shortstory writers poets 
and essayists playwrights and artists identified in dangerous 
dossiers as having secret files never knew they were being 
tracked by hoovers men or other government sleuths and not one 
mitgang says ever was accused of a crime 
galbraith in fact estimates for the author that the government 
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars investigating him 
by a wide margin the former us ambassador to india says 
it was the most expensively researched enterprise with which i 
have ever been associated 
and why apparently because someone to whom the fbi listened 
disagreed with his economic theories among other things 
mitgang writes the galbraith file noted that the subject leaned 
as far to the left as president roosevelt 
the disturbing aspect to all of this is that association with a 
group the government considered leftofcenter or the word of an 
unnamed snitch was all that it took to start a file in washington 
rarely if ever did an agent appear to have read what the subject 
of his report had written mitgang observes 
these are raw files the author says of his source material 
they were put in by unnamed informants in every case the names 
of informants were blacked out without any right of 
confrontation or without any ability to dispute what was said and 
as a result of that you have accusations by faceless people 
without a chance to answer 
today mitgang writes the government will expunge an incorrect 
record but not for a subject no longer living the lesson is 
clear he writes dont die if you want to reclaim your good 
name and reputation 
despite the tightening of rules against spying on ordinary 
citizens mitgang says government surveillance continues 
three thousand pages were obtained very recently by the center 
for constitutional rights and what they found out was that 
anyone who went to central america who signed a petition against 
the contras any of these people found themselves in files 
mitgang says 
and the targets in recent months that emerged were such 
organizations as the maryknoll sisters the united auto workers 
the national council of churches and im sure anyone who took a 
visa to go to central america

singer kym ryder sipped on her tea and squirmed 
in her seat she was discussing her childhood her days on the 
road her debut record but she would rather have been in front of 
an audience 
my idea of a good time is performing said ryder the 
closer i am to the people the better i want to sit on their 
table 
ryder whose new lp is angel arrive does not need a stage 
to attract attention she stands 5 feet 9 under a wave of blond 
hair she is outgoing and curious about the people around her she 
likes to talk she has a lot to say 
she knew from an early age she did not want to spend her entire 
life in minneapolis where she was born in 1965 and adopted by a 
ups employee and his wife her first live performance was a 
rendition of rudolph the rednosed reindeer sung in front of a 
collection of aunts and uncles she was 4 years old 
in junior high school she got involved in acting in high 
school she joined her first band and was impatient to pursue a 
career in music 
i was kind of a rebel in high school she said i thought 
it was a stupid setup school was just holding me down it was a 
very frustrating time 
a week after graduating she hit the road i followed bikers 
and things like that i got down and dirty for a while she said 
three years on the road frequently changing bands living out 
of a trunk and suitcase did little to discourage ryder 
you learn whether you want to do this for the rest of your 
life you like it or you dont it cuts the men from the boys 
she said laughing i loved it even when i was broke and 
starving 
two years ago performing in wyoming she caught the attention 
of a vacationing new york lawyer 
he saw me play and liked the energy ryder said he 
followed me 100 miles and saw me the next day he left roses in my 
hotel room i didnt see the roaches anymore 
the lawyer left a business card and suggested ryder look him up 
if she came to new york ryder came east and met david werner who 
produced the record and wrote the songs shatter the glass is 
the first single 
everything is so perfect then something happens and shatters 
the reality she said im like the devil the temptress i 
pull you in i shatter the fantasy 
the music on angel arrive is straight ahead poprock 
ryders singing shows the influence of the musics best known 
female vocalists 
i loved pat benatar i looked like her in high school she 
said singers like debbie harry and belinda carlisle thats who 
i sound like i have a pure voice very strong 
rock n roll has always appealed to nonconformists and ryder 
is no exception i was always the black sheep i always liked to 
dress weird she said people think im so outrageous my 
friends were just paralyzed by me 
ryder sees live performing as a way of breaking down barriers 
between herself and the audience she describes herself as a tomboy 
growing up and admits to feeling more comfortable around men on 
stage she has had trouble almost to the point of violence with 
women who feel threatened by her presence on stage 
sure i flirt on stage but i try to make it for fun i dont 
do that dripping kind of sex thing she said 
but occasionally she can connect one time was in salt lake 
city 
after one of my ballads a girl took off one of her earrings 
and handed it to me she remembered its still in my jewelry 
box things like that nail me 
although ryder must face the problems of being a woman in the 
music industry she considers herself relatively fortunate 
it sexism is around all the time but i havent had to deal 
with it in a bad way she said ive found very good people and 
stuck with them 
if shes had any disappointments its been with the pace of her 
career 
i dont like having to wait i dont like depending on other 
people im after the next thing 
but even if ryder has been frustrated by the lengthy process of 
getting her first album released she has lost none of her 
determination to succeed 
i never want to wake up and say i wish i would have you 
just go for it

big computer buyers say they hope the battle for 
control of atampts unix operating system does not fragment the 
important computing standard 
american telephone amp telegraph co faced a rebellion tuesday by 
seven major computer companies that want to establish a version of 
the unix software that would not be under atampts control 
the companies invited atampt to join their new open software 
foundation but atampt questioned the groups motives and vowed to 
continue its separate efforts to create a unified computing 
standard 
computer buyers are pressing strongly for a single computing 
standard that would make it possible for them to move their 
programs easily from one make of computer to another 
there is a need for some standardization and continuity in 
this whole process and somebody needs to play that oversight 
role larry bacon senior vice president of data processing for 
travelers corp in hartford conn said in an interview tuesday 
unix is a layer of software known as an operating system that 
controls the basic operations of a computer and lies invisibly 
beneath the programs that people use 
atampt invented unix but customers of other companies have 
demanded it partly because it makes it easier for computers of 
different makes to run the same programs 
the four american and three european computer companies want to 
use a version of unix as the core of a standardized environment 
that will go beyond just the operating system to include the whole 
scope of computing they said tuesday they will spend 90 million 
over the next three years 
we are certainly most enthusiastic about anything that can be 
done to standardize onto a single operating system said bruce 
rosenblatt manager of information systems planning for chevron 
corp in san francisco he expressed cautious support for the new 
foundation 
robert kavner the new president of atampts data systems group 
charged in an interview that some members of the open software 
foundation are not truly interested in openness 
the new group includes the worlds two biggest computer 
companies international business machines corp and digital 
equipment corp as well as hewlettpackard co apollo computer 
inc west germanys siemens ag and nixdorf computer ag and 
frances groupe bull 
top executives of all seven companies shared the stage at a new 
york auditorium tuesday in a rare show of force 
will our companies continue to compete with each other of 
course we will ibm chairman john f akers said this is quite 
an eventful day and i believe a good one 
the seven companies threw atampt on the defensive said marc 
schulman an analyst for salomon brothers inc on the other hand 
critics of the open software foundation say its members have 
reasons for their actions beyond those publicly stated 
ibm and digital both are strongly committed to their own 
operating systems which compete with unix keeping customers 
locked into their own operating systems gives them some shelter 
from competition 
investors and other people have a right to kind of look at 
todays events with a slightly jaundiced eye said john rutledge 
an analyst for dillon read amp co 
but salomons schulman said hewlettpackard which is strongly 
committed to unix is the driving force behind the foundation and 
would not have aligned itself with ibm and digital if it feared 
those companies would drag their feet the open software foundation 
said it will build its new operating system off the base of ibms 
version of unix known as aix the software environment will 
comply with a variety of national and international standards 
other companies are being invited to join the foundation for 
25000 a year and nonprofit groups for 5000 a year members 
will contribute staff

identified the industry is going to have to do one hell of a job 
of lobbying 
extending the quota program is high on the agenda at the 
american iron and steel institutes annual conference which began 
in earnest today in washington 
its a fragile recovery aisi president milton deaner said 
of the industrys health i see troubling signs among some 
government officials of a lessened sense of urgency about the need 
to cope with imports and the trade deficit in general 
importers argue that extended quotas will hurt the economy with 
higher prices and steel shortages domestic opposition also is 
forming in steelconsuming states enduring rising prices and tight 
supplies 
youve got a lot of people out there screeching and hollering 
in maine and iowa and nebraska about their inability to get 
steel said the steel specialist those people are going to be 
standing right up there come the debate on the extension of the 
vras 
some mills are operating virtually flat out and are turning away 
orders prices which dropped 15 percent after 1981 rose 4 percent 
to 5 pecent last year and could do the same this year analysts say 
the aisi estimates industry profits of 1 billion for 1987 
after 12 billion in losses from 1982 to 1986 
the reagan administrations quota program enhanced by currency 
exchange rates that make imported goods more expensive helped 
sustain financially weak us steelmakers while they wrote off 
unprofitable plants and modernized the remainder 
with employment down from about 390000 in 1981 to a record low 
of about 163000 for 1987 american steelmakers claim to be the 
most efficient in the world 
for the first time in 30 years we have lower costs of 
producing steel for our customers in the us than the japanese 
industry has in providing steel to their customers in japan said 
david roderick chairman of usx corp the nations largest 
steelmaker 
after a slow start in 1985 and 1986 the quota program contained 
foreign steel to 21 percent of the us market last year near its 
goal of 185 percent 
in this way the presidents program has been more successful 
than any import program attempted by government in the last 20 
years said thomas graham aisi chairman and head of steel 
operations at usx 
the principle of voluntary restraint has been established 
he said what is needed now is to bring more countries into the 
vra 
bringing canada which now ships steel freely to the united 
states into the quota plan will present a ticklish problem for the 
aisi whose members include canadas largest mills 
industry watchers say japan seems to favor the orderliness of 
the quotas as long as its aggressive pacific neighbors are 
included and european steelmakers may prefer extended quotas to 
the lawsuits they could face over allegedly unfair trade practices 
domestic producers likely will want restrictions eased on 
foreign made semifinished steel needed to supply americas roaring 
mills the government steel specialist said 
lobbying for and against an extension has begun although i 
dont think its in full swing said jack andresen director of 
the 94member bipartisan house steel caucus this fall or next 
year youll see a fullblown lobbying effort by both groups

a 4dayold strike by the united rubber 
workers union against firestone inc moves back to center stage 
following a tentative agreement that averted a walkout at 11 
goodyear tire amp rubber co plants 
union and goodyear negotiators reached an amended contract 
settlement shortly before a noon strike deadline on tuesday 
forestalling a strike by 15000 goodyear workers 
some 4700 firestone workers in six states went on strike sunday 
after union negotiators decided firestones offer didnt match an 
earlier agreement with goodyear which the union intended to serve 
as a pattern for firestone 
urw international president milan stone said the union would 
notify firestone of the changes made tuesday in goodyears new 
contract proposal 
they firestone werent willing to follow the pattern as it 
was on saturday night at midnight so i dont know what their 
response will be now stone said we have not heard from 
firestone since the strike began 
firestone officials said saturday the company believed its offer 
was equal to goodyears firestone spokesman bob troyer said 
tuesday the company would review the revised goodyear contract 
for the past two days the unions attention has been focused 
on goodyear troyer said now that they have reached a 
tentative agreement we hope they will get back with us and we can 
begin negotiating again 
the urw represents workers at firestone plants in noblesville 
ind des moines iowa decatur ill russellville ark and 
oklahoma city as well as maintenance workers and technicians in 
akron 
goodyear workers are to hold a ratification vote before a new 
strike deadline of may 24 
stone said three key changes were made in the threeyear 
agreement reached april 21 by the company and the union a majority 
of the membership at the 11 goodyear locals rejected the proposed 
pact on may 2 
added to the agreement was a 25 centsperhour wage increase 
however costofliving increases will be reduced by 25 cents in 
three steps 
the amended contract restores a requirement that all locals 
approve any wage concessions accepted by any single local stone 
said it also provides for a wage reopener in march 1990 that 
hinges on the companys recovery from the financial impact of an 
attempted takeover in 1986 
akronbased goodyear ended the takeover attempt by financier sir 
james goldsmith when it bought goldsmiths 115 percent share of 
the company for 619 million 
eleven of goodyears 42 plants nationwide would have been shut 
down by a strike the plants are in akron marysville and st 
marys ohio lincoln neb new bedford mass sun prairie wis

the nations two largest automakers could face 
300 million in penalties because of ruling by a sharply divided 
federal appeals court that upholds revised fuel economy ratings for 
19801984 model cars 
the us circuit court of appeals in washington split 55 along 
ideological lines tuesday leaving intact a 1986 order by a 
threejudge panel of the court the earlier order followed a 
challenge of new environmental protection agency standards by the 
center for auto safety a consumer activist group 
at issue is epas decision in 1985 to raise the fuel economy 
ratings for cars made between 1980 and 1984 to reflect seven 
changes in test procedures ford and gm contended the original 
method had unfairly lowered the ratings 
the higher ratings recalculated by epa lowered penalties against 
ford and gm for falling short of the fueleconomy standards set 
under the environmental policy and conservation act of 1975 
under the law manufacturers are penalized 5 for each tenth of 
a mile a model falls short of the milespergallon standard the 
law also gives manufacturers credits for surpassing the standards 
that can be carried over into subsequent model years 
the threejudge panel had unanimously held that in recalculating 
the ratings epa should also have factored in changes in several 
test procedures that had benefited manufacturers by raising the 
scores 
the full court later vacated the panels ruling and agreed to 
rehear the case 
the automobile manufacturers have never provided an estimate of 
how much the 1986 ruling would cost them but the center for auto 
safety estimates it could result in penalties up to 300 million 
for ford and gm chrysler corp was not affected because its cars 
met the fueleconomy standards for those years 
gm spokesman bill nowack said in a statement that the decision 
is symptomatic of the burdensome problems cafe the fuel economy 
system has represented in recent years which have threatened 
american productivity and jobs but he added that the potential 
impact of the court decision and the expected epa rulemaking are 
yet to be fully determined 
the judges split along liberal and conservative lines over 
whether the center had legal standing to challenge the way the epa 
recalculated the corporate average fuel economy ratings 
chief judge patricia wald who wrote the original 1986 opinion 
tartly accused her conservative colleagues of ignoring legal 
precedent the will of congress and common sense in questioning the 
centers right to bring the case 
conservatives argued that the consumer group lacked legal 
standing because it could not prove that epas decision inflicted 
an economic harm 
the fact that congress has determined that consumers would be 
injured by driving automobiles that use more rather than less fuel 
is of little help in determining whether these petitioners are able 
to establish injuriesinfact sufficiently personal and 
concrete to meet the requirements for legal standing judge james 
l buckley wrote in a dissent he was joined by judges douglas h 
ginsburg stephen williams and kenneth starr 
wald joined by judges abner mikva spottswood robinson ruth b 
ginsburg and harry edwards said the consumers have standing 
because the injury they suffer is a traditional economic one 
higher prices and diminished availability of the goods they seek

the house is sending a warning to federal 
managers and private contractors doing government work say no to 
drugs in the workplace or risk losing the money arriving from the 
treasury 
in what could be the first of a series of votes in the coming 
weeks the house on tuesday approved an amendment that would cut 
off the flow of public funds to federal and privatesector 
workplaces with illegal drug problems 
the amendment was tacked onto the first fiscal 1989 
appropriations bill to reach the house floor a 178 billion 
package to finance the department of energy and water development 
projects by the army corps of engineers and the interior 
departments bureau of reclamation 
the spending bill was sent to the senate by a 38420 roll call 
shortly after the house voted 273127 for the antidrug amendment 
offered by rep robert walker rpa 
walker said the ban would apply to federal offices covered by 
the spending bill and privatesector companies holding government 
contracts for such activities as research and construction 
there is nothing in this amendment that says you have to go to 
drug testing said walker adding that he hopes to add the 
provision to the 12 other fiscal 1989 appropriations bills heading 
toward the house floor 
he said the major effect of the amendment would be to encourage 
private employers doing business with the federal government to 
adopt and enforce policies against drugs in their workplaces 
walker said that with such a policy in place an employer could 
probably avoid losing contract payments by convincing officials 
that an instance of onthejob drug abuse was an aberration not a 
regular occurrence 
the pennsylvania lawmaker recently succeeded in convincing 
colleagues on the science and technology committee to add the 
antidrug language to authorization bills for four agencies 
including the national aeronautics and space administration and the 
national science foundation 
tuesdays vote was the first by the full house on the proposal 
walker said he hopes to improve the language of the amendment to 
include provisions to establish procedures for cutting off money 
because of workplace problems with drugs 
the amendment drew only brief debate before it was added to 
legislation to finance energy and water development projects for 
the year beginning oct 1 
the bills floor manager rep tom bevill dala said the 
package was 357 million below the reagan administrations request 
and was consistent with deficitreduction agreement reached last 
year by the white house and congressional leaders 
the bill contains money to continue work on hundreds of dams 
harbors and irrigation systems but according to bevill none to 
begin any new projects because of the budget deficit aides to 
bevill say they cant recall the last time an appropriations bill 
came to the floor without new projects 
the office of management and budget disagrees with the 
nonewstarts description spokeswoman barbara clay said the bill 
contains eight new starts although she notes omb and congress 
disagree over what constitutes the start of construction 
under any definition of a new start the legislation is 
modest compared with past years when the annual porkbarrel 
spending bill contained 20 or more construction starts 
clay said that while the administration is not displeased 
with the bills price tag it was unhappy because it bars the start 
of construction for the super collider the huge physics project 
for research into basic matter 
bevill said the prohibition was placed into the bill because 
lawmakers want the next administration to decide whether to proceed 
with a major undertaking that could cost from 44 billion to 9 
billion

media general incs board of directors has 
rejected an offer by california investor burt sugarman to end his 
takeover bid in exchange for a large share of the companys cable 
television operation in northern virginia media general officials 
say 
the companys board turned down the offer as greenmail of the 
most egregious sort president james s evans said tuesday night 
greenmail occurs when a company gets a potential acquirer to end 
the chase by agreeing to buy back its own shares at a premium not 
available to other stockholders 
jeffrey taufield a spokesman for sugarman would not confirm 
the terms of the purported offer or even that an offer was made on 
sugarmans behalf 
taufield quoted sugarman as describing media generals version 
as a lastminute desperation move to turn around a proxy 
contest that he contended media general is losing it just 
wont work 
j stewart bryan iii vice chairman of media general said the 
offer was made monday afternoon by sugarmans financial advisers to 
media generals financial advisers 
sugarman proposed withdrawing his nominees for three of the nine 
seats on the companys board in balloting that ends friday and 
exchanging his groups 101 percent share of media general publicly 
traded stock for about 43 percent of a new company that would own 
the cable system in fairfax county company officials said 
media general is seeking the reelection of its three directors 
and the family of chairman d tennant bryan opposes the sale of the 
richmondbased communications company at any price sugarman 
chairman of two companies that produce cement and television game 
shows has offered 18 billion for media general or 70 a share 
sugarman was seeking to buy the cable system at a bargain 
basement price evans said sugarmans investment adviser valued 
the system at 300 million while the company values it at 450 
million to 600 million according to stewart bryan 
that prompted the charge of greenmail 
sugarman couldnt be reached for comment but taufield said 
sugarman said he never made media general an offer 
taufield declined comment on whether sugarmans financial 
advisers at bear stearns amp co forwarded a proposal for spinning 
off the cable system and letting sugarman obtain a 43 percent stake 
in it 
legal and investment banking advisers for both sugarmans group 
and media general have been communicating throughout the 
process taufield said 
he said sugarman reiterated his pledge not to accept greenmail 
and that a proposal to pay shareholders 70 per share in a 18 
billion transaction remains on the table 
bear stearns executives went to the offices of goldman sachs amp 
co media generals financial adviser in new york monday afternoon 
and made the offer i dont think it was in writing stewart 
bryan said 
asked what the companys next move would be he said i dont 
know what to expect from people of his type there is no next move 
as far as im concerned

state and federal consumer protection 
laws dont cover leased vehicles a florida appeal court ruled 
a threejudge panel of the 1st district court of appeal 
concluded in a unanimous opinion tuesday that floridas uniform 
commercial code and the federal magnusonmoss warranty act should 
cover leased cars but they dont 
obviously in todays market place a compelling case can be 
made for applying the principles of the magnusonmoss act to 
transactions of the type before us but that remains a matter for 
legislative decision the judges wrote 
both laws permit purchasers to return vehicles and other new 
items that have numerous defects not satisfactorily repaired by 
dealers and manufacturers 
the judges said it was the first time a florida appellate court 
had ruled on the issue 
the opinion upheld a decision by circuit judge ac soud jr 
who ordered a directed verdict in favor of frank griffin amc jeep 
inc of jacksonville and american credit corp in a suit filed by 
timothy l sellers and kristi h sellers over a defective lease 
vehicle 
the dealer had refused to take back the sellers new jeep 
cherokee or refund their down payment and lease payments after the 
car allegedly developed numerous problems including an engine that 
exploded rattles and leaks seat covers that separated brakes 
that failed and an air conditioning system that didnt cool 
soud and the appeal judges found neither state nor federal law 
covered the couple because the statutes apply only to sales 
transactions 
the sellers would have wound up paying about the same as if they 
had purchased the vehicle because they would have had to carry 
insurance and have the car serviced and repaired 
the legal incidents of a lease vary significantly from those 
of a sale and the parties unambiguous expression of intent to 
create only a lease cannot be overturned by this court through 
legal recharacterization of the transaction the judges wrote 
transactions like this one obviously should be made subject to 
ucc provisions for revocation of the acceptance when a defective 
vehicle is delivered pursuant to either a sale or a long term 
lease the judges stated nevertheless we must leave this 
solution to the legislature

harvard universitys clerical and 
technical workers narrowly approved a bid to unionize but the 
fight that set an ivy league faculty against an administration 
accused of strongarm tactics may not be over 
tuesdays vote which the president of the parent union called 
an important step in organizing whitecollar workers ended with 
the union winning by 44 votes 
the unofficial count tuesday night was 1530 to 1486 but 41 
ballots were challenged said allison chisolm a university 
spokeswoman the university has asked the national labor relations 
board to investigate the conduct of the union in the election 
were all ecstatic said kristine rondeau the unions chief 
organizer and a former harvard employee we want to make this a 
model for women everywhere 
harvards 3300 clerical and technical workers have always 
bargained on their own a practice organizers say has resulted in 
lower pay for women who comprise 83 percent of the group 
rondeau maintained the union was victorious saying whenever 
you have a big and powerful and sophisticated employee like this 
one you always have a close vote 
the prestige of harvard and the publicity generated by the union 
effort increased the importance of tuesdays voting gerald 
mcentee president of the 11 millionmember american federation of 
state county and municipal employees called it the premier test 
of our union in 1988 
afscme would be the parent union of the harvard union of 
clerical and technical workers 
as goes harvard mcentee said so goes the unorganized 
whitecollar sector of the economy 
the struggle to unionize reminiscent of a 1985 campaign that 
led to a bitter strike by clerical and technical workers at 
harvards ivy league rival yale university went on for more than 
a year and became increasingly public as union representatives 
accused the university of strongarm antiunion tactics 
the university argued that the union offered workers no 
substantive promises 
i dont think were antiunion said anne taylor who 
directed harvards response to the organizational effort we have 
run an extremely fair factbased campaign 
last month 27 faculty members signed a fullpage advertisement 
published in the campus newspaper calling on the administration to 
stop interfering in the union campaign 
last sunday 350 faculty members religious leaders actors 
elected officials and civil rights activists signed an 
advertisement supporting the union under the headline were with 
you 
taylor said the outcome of the election could be affected by an 
investigation into reports that the union may have engaged in 
conduct prohibited by the national labor law 
until the nlrb has certified the results they are not 
final she said in the event the nlrb declares the union the 
winner harvard will work constructively with the union in the 
interest of support staff and the university 
henry griggs spokesman for afscme said harvards clerical 
workers have waited a long time for this but theyll have a 
fight on their hands theyll have to negotiate a contract but at 
least this time theyll have a voice 
university president derek bok told the workers in a letter that 
he believes in the union movement but feels it is inappropriate for 
their type of work 
unions have typically resisted efforts to reward superior 
achievement with greater compensation or to allow supervisors and 
employees to vary the way they work in response to their special 
needs and capabilities bok wrote 
a clerical union would cover 110 job descriptions rondeau said 
including librarians secretaries biomedical assistants and copy 
center operators she said typical annual salaries for clerical 
workers at harvard are around 18000

housing construction edged up 05 percent in april the third 
monthly gain in a row after a sharp slump at the end of last year 
the government reported today 
the commerce department said the increase pushed construction 
activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 156 million units 
the increase last month followed a gain of 23 percent in march 
and 99 percent in february but housing activity was still 45 
percent below last year in part because of declines in december 
and january 
many economists now believe rising mortgage interest rates could 
choke off housing growth later this year 
the governments report tuesday that the march trade deficit 
fell to the lowest level in three years helped the dollar but 
failed to inspire other financial markets 
while the dollar climbed against most other currencies after 
tuesdays report stock and bond prices sagged 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 2122 points 
to 198641 erasing its 1708point gain on monday broader stock 
market indices also fell in the credit markets yields on the 
bellwether 30year treasury bond rose to 921 percent from 911 
percent late monday 
the commerce department said a record level of exports helped 
reduce the trade deficit to 97 billion in march compared with the 
february imbalance of 138 billion 
american exports rose 23 percent to an alltime high of 29 
billion in march as demand for us machinery aircraft computers 
and chemicals picked up sharply that offset a 36 percent increase 
in imports which rose to 387 billion 
for the first quarter of 1988 the trade deficit totaled 36 
billion an annual pace of 144 billion last year the merchandise 
trade deficit hit a record 1712 billion but as expected to 
decline by about 20 billion this year 
analysts said some investors are worried the export boom will 
spark another round of inflation in the united states as factories 
many already operating at peak capacity begin to raise prices 
the federal reserve board said in a separate economic report 
tuesday that american industry operated at an eightyear high of 
827 percent of capacity in april a 03 percentage point rise from 
march 
the high operating rate was solid evidence of the boom in export 
sales economists said but they cautioned that the country wais 
approaching a danger zone in which tight labor markets begin 
pushing prices higher unemployment fell to a 14year low of 54 
percent last month 
you would have to read the trade number as evidence supporting 
the view that wages and prices will be firming up and there will be 
further inflationary pressures later this year said jerry 
jasinowski chief economist of the national association of 
manufacturers 
that view was echoed in a survey indicating the nations 
purchasing managers have become more optimistic the economy will 
continue growing this year but also expect higher inflation 
in their latest semiannual forecast 73 percent of the 
purchasing managers predicted the economy would be better in 1988 
than it was in 1987 compared with 57 percent in their december 
report 
they forecast a net average increase in prices of about 58 
percent for the year the report said compared with their december 
forecast of a 36 percent price rise for all of 1988 
the latest survey was released by the national association of 
purchasing management an education and research organization

the sharp decline in the us trade 
deficit in march was welcomed wednesday by taiwan which has been 
under pressure from us officials to reduce its huge trade surplus 
the us commerce department reported taiwans trade surplus 
with the united states was 5318 million in march down from 134 
billion the month before 
thats really exciting news said lin chienshan economics 
professor at fu jen university 
lin said the narrowing trade imbalance would help alleviate us 
pressure on taiwan to appreciate its currency against the us 
dollar a stronger taiwan dollar makes the islands products less 
competitive in the american market and helps us goods sell in 
taiwan 
the us dollar gained slightly against the taiwan dollar in the 
foreign exchange market wednesday the taiwan dollar traded at 
2862 per us dollar compared with the 2861 rate maintained for 
the past 14 days 
the taiwan dollar has appreciated 39 percent since january 1986 
largely under us pressure

a federal law governing injured railroad 
employees cost american railroads 600 million in one year yet 
does not benefit workers fairly and should be changed or dropped 
union pacific railroad chairman michael h walsh said 
in a speech prepared for tuesday delivery to medical directors 
of the american association of railroads in las vgas walsh said 
the law is archaic and causes suffering both for injured workers 
and railroads 
only the lawyers are sure winners under the system said 
walsh who labeled the law fundamentally wrong 
he said the federal employees liability act of 1908 requires 
railroad workers injured on the job to sue their employers and show 
negligence to receive any compensation 
unlike the rest of american workers our people are not 
covered by nofault state workers compensation walsh said 
he said the 600 million cost of the liability act in 1986 was 
equal to 80 percent of the 747 million in total profits by the 
nations railroads in 1986 
railroads are not having too many accidents he said between 
1981 and 1986 the number of employees injured dropped by 53 
percent partly because rail employment declined by 35 percent 
as a result federal liability claims per 100 employees dropped 
by 21 percent during that time he said 
yet the number of fela cases resolved through lawsuits more 
than doubled and the payout under fela went from 400 million to 
600 million walsh said 
the law is still on the books because it is a source of revenue 
for lawyers said walsh a law school graduate 
walsh said an employee who loses a leg in a railroad accident 
is thrown into a virtual lottery system in one court he may 
receive millions in another nothing 
by requiring blame in accidents fela encourages each side to 
accuse the other rather than helping the injured worker and 
preventing similar accidents walsh said 
the trauma of intense litigation and the uncertainty of 
recovering damages increases the distress of the injured 
employee he said 
if the statute were repealed and rail workers were placed in the 
same workers compensation system as others he said employees 
would benefit from more certain and uniform compensation faster 
payment greater incentives for rehabilitation and reduced friction 
between employees and management 
walsh said attorneys who represent injured workers have 
mounted an aggressive media campaign which misrepresents the fela 
as a safety statute and that some labor groups also oppose 
repeal

the chicago board of trade with soybeans leading the way as 
meteorologists predicted rain in most cropgrowing areas 
showers were developing over the central great plains this 
morning and were expected to move slowly eastward bringing badly 
needed moisture to most of the midwest by this weekend

weeks due to a lack of moisture which is needed to get newly 
planted seeds to sprout

housing construction edged up 05 percent in 
april the third monthly gain in a row after a sharp slump at the 
end of last year the government said today 
the commerce department said the increase pushed construction 
activity to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 156 million units 
but all of the strength came in apartment construction which 
often has wide monthtomonth swings construction of singlefamily 
homes a closely watched category posted a decline which analysts 
blamed on rising interest rates 
in the singlefamily its a little bit discouraging to see 
starts fall off like that but at the same time weve started to 
see interest rates drift up said thomas m holloway senior 
economist for the mortgage bankers association of america 
our outlook is for interest rates to continue to drift up over 
the year and for starts to continue to decline modestly he 
said 
the overall increase last month followed a gain of 23 percent 
in march and 99 percent in february but housing activity was 
still 45 percent below last year in part because of declines in 
december and january 
housing starts plummeted 158 percent in december and then fell 
another 12 percent in january analysts attributed the slump to 
builders fear that the october stock market crash would dampen 
home buying since then the economy has proved to be robust and 
interest rates have emerged as the new threat to housing activity 
housing permits considered a good sign of future economic 
activity fell 41 percent in april to a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate of 142 million units 
the strength in starts last month came entirely in construction 
of multifamily units which soared 233 percent to 466000 units 
that more than offset a 69 percent decline in singlefamily units 
which fell by 69 percent 
it was the reverse of the usual pattern apartment construction 
has been depressed since early 1987 because the new tax law removed 
many of the benefits of investing in real estate 
the overall increase in april was paced by a 224 percent rise 
in the midwest and a 52 percent climb in the south 
housing starts fell 89 percent in the northeast and 130 
percent in the west

the soybean market is likely to fluctuate 
wildly this summer in response to factors ranging from weather 
conditions to the amount of us soybean exports to the soviet 
union several economists say 
the market already is more sensitive than usual because of tight 
us reserves the economists said 
iowa state university extension economist robert wisner says 
prices could drop sharply by september after reaching a peak he 
based the prediction on market performance during six previous 
years with tight soybean supplies and barring a widespread drought 
higher spring prices during those years prompted farmers to 
plant more soybeans pushing prices down he said the scenario 
could be repeated this year 
the years 1973 1977 1978 1979 1982 and 1984 were marked by a 
tight soybean supply a strong price rally in the spring 
largerthanindicated plantings and a sharp decline in prices by 
sept 1 he said 
this year we have the tight bean supply and the spring price 
rally we could have the increased acreage so the market pattern 
could be very similar wisner said in a telephone interview with 
the omaha worldherald from his ames iowa office 
grain and soybean futures opened lower wednesday on the chicago 
board of trade with soybeans leading the way as meteorologists 
predicted rain in most cropgrowing areas 
concern over dry conditions in the midwest and a 
smallerthanexpected south american soybean crop are responsible 
for the recent high prices said roger hoskin agricultural 
economist with the us department of agriculture 
the national weather services midmay to midjune outlook 
predicts dry conditions for most of the soybeanproducing states 
including missouri illinois indiana and ohio 
the us soybean supply now estimated at 11 billion bushels 
is expected to drop to 145 million bushels by sept 1 1989 stocks 
at that level represent 7 percent of the annual use wisner said 
when stocks drop below 10 percent of annual use he said the 
market has traditionally been volatile 
another factor is uncertainty over soybean exports to the soviet 
union since september that country has bought 831000 metric tons 
from the united states said tom bickerton a usda economist 
the soviets expect to buy about 1 million more metric tons by 
aug 31 but bickerton said anything is possible

macmillan inc common stock rocketed higher 
today following an unsolicited 15 billion takeover proposal from 
a group led by texas financier robert m bass 
the chairman of publishing concern addressing shareholders at 
the companys annual meeting this morning said macmillans board 
had not had a chance to discuss the proposal but said the company 
was not for sale 
the 64ashare proposal was disclosed after the stock market 
had closed tuesday by midday today macmillan stock had soared 20 
a share to 7062 on the new york stock exchange 
as the shareholders meeting convened today chairman edward p 
evans noted he had received an unsolicited inquiry about the 
possible sale of the company he said company management felt 
confident about macmillans growth potential and added that the 
company is not for sale 
but he also said that since the offer was disclosed so recently 
macmillans board had not had a chance to discuss it and declined 
further comment 
bass who heads the robert m bass group inc in fort worth 
texas disclosed tuesday that he had sent a letter to evans in 
which he proposed paying acquiring all of macmillans stock 
bass said the offer was intended to be consensual and was 
conditioned upon approval by the macmillan board of directors and 
on macmillan not issuing any additional equity securities 
a proposal to authorize issuance of new preferred stock was on 
todays meeting agenda and the company said shareholders approved 
it 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission bass 
said his group owned about 24 million macmillan shares or about 
91 percent of the companys 261 million common shares outstanding 
in the letter to evans bass said the 64ashare price was 
based on publicly available information and could be increased if 
nonpublic information indicated a higher price is warranted 
he said he hoped evans and macmillan senior management could be 
persuaded to participate in the transaction 
bass said the offer also was conditioned on obtaining the 
necessary financing and said his group has about 250 million 
available to purchase equity and subordinated debt of macmillan 
acquisition of macmillan would not be the bass groups first 
venture into publishing 
the proposal came as shareholders of bell amp howell co a 
publishing and information services company based in skokie ill 
approved a buyout offer valued at about 700 million from an 
affiliate of the bass group and senior management 
macmillan based in new york publishes educational textbooks 
aimed at elementary through college grade levels as well as books 
of general interest 
it offers information services such as whos who listings and 
demographic information and has interests in instructional 
services including the katherine gibbs business schools and berlitz

new disclosures by the securities and exchange 
commission could widen the scope of money laundering charges 
against ef hutton amp co a major brokerage firm that was absorbed 
by shearson lehman hutton inc 
the sec disclosed in documents it made public tuesday that 
shearson has uncovered possible instances of money laundering at 
several new york branch offices of hutton 
shearson a giant investment firm which acquired hutton in 
december 1987 pleaded guilty on huttons behalf monday to three 
criminal counts of money laundering and conspiracy at huttons 
branch in providence ri shearson was fined 101 million for the 
offenses which occurred between 1982 and 1984 
also tuesday the sec granted shearson a temporary exemption 
from securities laws that would bar it from acting as an investment 
adviser in providence because of its guilty plea 
the sec documents based on information supplied to the agency 
early this year by shearson said an internal investigation 
conducted by shearson turned up possible cases of money laundering 
at several hutton retail branches in the new york city area 
the documents did not disclose how much money may have been 
laundered through the hutton branches the period in which it may 
have occurred or how many branches may have been involved 
the new disclosures will not have any impact on shearsons 
continuing business operations said a shearson spokesman who 
declined to be identified

covered 24 hutton branches in the new york metropolitan area four 
hutton branches randomly selected in the financial districts of los 
angeles dallas chicago and miami and the administrative 
departments at huttons new york headquarters that were responsible 
for the branches concerned 
the investigation revealed evidence of money laundering in the 
form of unreported currency transactions at some of the new york 
branches prior to shearson taking over hutton 
no such transactions were found in the branches outside new york 
that were reviewed the documents said 
cash transactions over 10000 must be reported to the internal 
revenue service in the providence case hutton and two of its 
former brokers were charged with helping clients hide about 15 
million in cash from the irs 
one of the brokers brian lareau pleaded innocent on tuesday 
the other broker died of cancer two years ago 
shearson said its outside attorneys are studying the possible 
involvement of any individuals in these branches the firm said it 
will take appropriate action against any current hutton employee 
involved in violations

the european economic community is seeking 
a bigger role for its struggling film industry 
the 12nation trading bloc announced wednesday the formation of 
a program to promote the industry while shielding it from foreign 
competitiors like hollywood moviemakers 
the program unveiled during the cannes film festival is known 
as media for measures to encourage the development of the 
industry of audiovisual production 
eec cultural commissioner carlo ripa de meana said the eec will 
provide about 67 million as seed money for cooperative 
audiovisual projects or about half of the estimated 135 million 
need for the program the rest of the funding will come from 
private and public groups he said 
ripa de meana said one project will subsidize distribution of 
lowbudget films if distributors from at least three nations agree 
to distribute them he estimated 50 films would be eliglble for 
such aid this year 
lowbudget films are those made for less than 28 million they 
comprise 80 percent of all films made in the eec and 80 percent 
of them never cross the frontiers of their country of origin 
said ripa de meana 
the media program also proposes to help provide business and 
technical training courses for young european producers create a 
group to attract financing and to coordinate the marketing efforts 
of 200 independent european film makers 
the aim of this mobilization of intelligence and talent is to 
respond to a threat which is already highly evident on our screens 
both large and small ripa de meana told a news conference 
sixty percent of the films distributed in the community come 
from the united states 
in addition he said more than 70 percent of films and 
miniseries on european television are imported with more than 
half of them coming from the united states 
ripa de meana said the number of eecproduced films has fallen 
about 40 percent in the last 15 years

four men were arrested today in a failed scheme 
to embezzle 70 million from the nations 10thlargest bank through 
a series of computerized cash transfers officials said 
officials at first national bank of chicago credited their own 
security system tuesday with helping foil the sophisticated scheme 
involving banks in new york and chicago a bank spokesman called it 
one of the biggestalmost crimes in the country 
federal agents had staked out chicagos airports shortly after 
the failed attempt was revealed by bank officials tuesday but 
james d mckenzie agent in charge of the chicago office of the 
fbi declined to provide any details about the arrrests of the four 
men 
the four two from chicago and two from detroit were to appear 
before a us magistrate later today he said 
the chicago tribune and the chicago suntimes quoting 
unidentified sources reported today the money ultimately was to be 
channeled to vienna austria where a bank worker had set up 
accounts the newspapers said the suspect had worked at the bank 
six to eight years but was not a highranking official 
it was not clear whether the suspect was among those arrested 
today 
no loss is expected to the bank or its customers the bank said 
the worker has been identified but may not have acted alone 
said bank spokesman tony zehnder he refused to give details 
saying the investigation had been turned over to the fbi he would 
not say how the bank learned of the scheme 
fbi spokesman jim kuntzelman said his agency was studying the 
possibility that up to seven people were involved in the scheme 
which affected the accounts of the new yorkbased financial firm 
merrill lynch amp co chicagobased united airlines and louisville 
kybased brownforman corp the wine and spirits company 
no arrests were made and no charges were filed by tuesday night 
kuntzelman said 
it was really the efficiency and the soundness of our controls 
that allowed us to thwart this embezzlement zehnder said this 
has to be one of the biggest almostcrimes in the country were 
quite pleased that our system came through for us 
at many banks money can be transfered to various accounts by 
computer a person with access to certain accounts and computer 
codes could transfer by wire large sums of money from chicago to 
banks in new york and from there to international banks 
you could set up an endless chain of wire transfers with the 
right connections zehnder said 
merrill lynch issued a statement saying it discovered monday 
that 20 million was missing from its account and rumors of huge 
losses circulated on wall street forcing first national to issue a 
statement on the discovery of the scheme 
united airlines declined comment tuesday and officials of 
brownforman could not be reached at company headquarters tuesday 
night 
neither zehnder nor merrill lynch gave details of the fraudulent 
transfers but the tribune and sun times said the employee wired 
the funds to citibank and chase manhattan bank in new york from 
which it was to be transferred to vienna 
the newspapers said the employee used fake tape recordings of 
the voices of two merrill lynch officials who were authorized to 
approve wire transfers one of the officials was in california at 
the time the other in the hospital 
zehnder said 50 million of the transferred money was back in 
chicago and the rest was expected back today 
as of dec 31 1987 first national had deposits of about 272 
billion according to american banker a trade newspaper first 
chicago corp the banks parent company was no 10 among bank 
holding companies with assets of about 442 billion

controlled by financier rupert murdoch said wednesday that its 
profit in the nine months ended march 31 rose 288 percent over the 
same period a year earlier 
the company which is based in sydney australia did not 
provide figures for the latest quarter 
a statement said news corps earnings rose to 3005 million

quarters of its 1988 fiscal year that compared with a profit of 
2333 million dollars in the 1987 period

the companys primary businesses include newspaper magazine and 
book publishing along with motion picture and television 
production and distribution it has operations in the united 
states britain australia and pacific basin countries 
media corp attributed its gains to income from acquisitions 
in australia and pacific basin increased profits from australian 
and united kingdom publishing operations and foreign exchange 
trading gains 
these gains were partly offset by reduced earnings in the 
united states lower dividend income and higher interest expense 
the statement said 
the company said its us operating earnings were 8 percent 
lower in the latest ninemonth period at 2917 million australian 
dollars or about 225 million 
it said fiscal 1987 us earnings were buoyed by two very 
profitable movies releases by twentieth century fox film corp this 
years performance reflects the difficult comparisons for motion 
picture operations and results for the television stations that 
were below expectations it said

the united states renewed its call wednesday for a 
global elimination of government aid to farmers but the proposal 
came under heavy attack from major european countries 
us agriculture secretary richard e lyng told a meeting of 
trade and finance ministers from 24 leading industrial nations the 
us government was ready to bite the political bullet on 
agricultural subsidies 
but he added that a us proposal for banning all 
tradedistorting farm subsidies by the year 2000 made last june 
by president reagan was conditioned on all us trading partners 
doing the same 
it is time for all of us to pay more than lip service to the 
reform of agricultural trade lyng told the regular spring 
meeting of the organization for economic cooperation and 
development 
he likened government use of farm subsidies to the practice of 
dumping urban waste in rivers and streams 
the economic pollution which results causes all kinds of 
instability and distress leading inevitably to social and 
political turmoil he said 
the us farm proposal is opposed by the european economic 
community which represents 12 european countries on trade issues 
willy de clercq the eecs top trade official told the meeting 
the us approach was unrealistic he said the eec or common 
market would not budge from its view that shortterm reforms in 
agriculture policy are needed before the longerterm us aims can 
be considered 
farm policy reforms including proposals put forth by 
washington the eec canada and others are in the early stages of 
negotiation in the uruguay round of trade talks in the 96nation 
general agreement on tariffs and trade the gatt sets and monitors 
world trade rules 
lyng said the paris meeting while not a negotiating forum 
should endorse a framework for action between now and december 
when gatt trade ministers will meet to review progress on 
agricultural and other issues 
after wednesdays session lyng told reporters that experts from 
the 24 participating countries would meet overnight to seek 
agreement on the specific language of a paris communique to be 
issued at the close of discussions thursday 
asked whether the reagan administration wanted a specific 
commitment from its trading partners to set a target date for 
eliminating farm subsidies lyng declined to comment directly 
our position is clear you know what our position is what we 
tabled in the gatt he said wed like to see that accepted or 
at least a statement consistent with that in the acceptance of a 
longterm objective 
jacques poos the treasury minister of luxembourg said the 
atmosphere of the debate on farm policy was friendly but yielded no 
indications that a consensus would be reached 
michael wilson the canadian finance minister told reporters 
his government was pushing hard to find a middle ground between 
washington and the europeans 
we have very definite positions taken by the two 
extremes he said adding that ottawa felt frustrated at the lack 
of progress in the gatt on agricultural issues 
de clercq accused the reagan administration of souring the 
atmosphere in the gatt farm talks by increasing its subsidies for 
farm product exporters seeking to compete with the common market 
exporters 
an eec position paper issued at the paris meeting attacked us 
farm policy on several fronts and suggested that the us proposal 
for eliminating subsidies was little more than a smokescreen it 
said the effects of us farm programs were damaging to the world 
economy 
they create an imbalance between those who are reforming 
their agricultural policy and those who while parading grand 
ambitions for a distant future practice day after day a policy 
which is likely to lead to confrontation on world markets the 
paper said

grain and soybean futures closed higher wednesday 
on the chicago board of trade after some meteorologists modified 
their forecasts for badly needed rain in cropgrowing areas 
but most forecasters continued to predict weekend showers in the 
midwest 
wheat futures turned in an unusually strong performance as talk 
circulated that dry weather had damaged enough of the maturing soft 
red winter wheat crop to significantly affect yields analysts said 
some people are disappointed in the yield prospects as some 
dryness continues to persist during this critical growing peroid 
said steve freed an analyst in chicago with the investment firm 
dean witter reynolds inc 
soybean futures have been extremely sensitive to weather and 
other supply factors because us stockpiles are declining 
talk that congress may approve a measure allowing soybean 
planting on corn setaside acreage next year prompted some 
spreadtype activity by traders who sold soybean contracts for 
november delivery while buying contracts for nearterm delivery 
freed said 
at the close wheat was 4 cents to 5 cents higher with may at 
323 a bushel corn was cent to 1 cent higher with may at 209 
a bushel oats were 1 cents to 2 cents higher with may at 163 
a bushel soybeans were 1 cent to 8 cents higher with may at

trading wrenching the dow jones average down more than 30 points 
in a selloff that brokers blamed on investor fear of inflation and 
rising interest rates

pension funds sold stock as yields on the key 30year treasury 
bond flirted with the 93 percent level the highest since the 
october crash

brokers said many investors still were reacting to the drop in 
the trade deficit reported tuesday by the commerce department 
although the 97 billion shortfall for march was the lowest 
monthly level in three years it was regarded on wall street as 
further evidence of a resurgent economy and therefore higher 
inflation 
youre seeing a market that is a little confused said hank 
striefler senior vice president on the trading floor at shearson 
lehman hutton inc in new york people are interpreting good news 
as bad news 
many investment professionals said the stock market was strongly 
influenced by rising yields in the bond market a sensitive 
barometer of inflation and the economy higher yields are making 
bonds more attractive than stocks especially during times of 
investment uncertainty

us imports of crude oil rose 241 percent in 
april from yearearlier levels while total domestic production 
registered a 27 percent decline a trade association reported 
wednesday 
and the american petroleum institute said unlike previous 
months the latest domestic production figure did not include a 
yeartoyear increase in alaskan output to partially offset a 
decline in the lower 48 states 
in its monthly statistical report washingtonbased api said 
us imports of crude oil and petroleum products averaged 704 
million 42gallon barrels a day in april up from 577 million 
barrels daily in april 1987 
domestic crude production averaged an estimated 817 million 
barrels a day in april compared with 84 million barrels daily 
last april while deliveries of domestic refined products slipped 
by 01 percent it said 
the report said demand for petroleum products in april as 
measured by domestic deliveries from primary storage was not much 
different from that of last april 
but over the first four months of this year it was a different 
story with deliveries increasing to 1744 million barrels daily 
a surprisingly high 46 percent gain over the 1987 period said 
gene johnson an api spokesman 
in previous years 1 percent or 2 percent was considered high 
so a 46 percent was very very unexpected its a significant 
increase he added 
the report said this aprils inventories rose by 22 million 
barrels because of higher imports and belowtrend deliveries 
although aprils totals on average have historically shown 
little direction during the month 
crude oil stocks accounted for half of the increase gasoline 
stocks held nearly steady while distillate inventories in a 
contraseasonal move rose slightly it added 
distillates refer to diesel oil and heating oil

when the us trade deficit for march improved 
beyond all expectations many economists and big investors 
responded with a chorus of bah humbug 
funny they should pan what would seem like fabulous news but 
theyve done it before and most likely theyll do it again 
they responded that way to news of a lower jobless rate to 
increases in factory use even to the dollars new stability 
it is a strange discomfiting world in which good is bad happy 
is sad up is down square is round best is worst last is first 
strong is weak bottom is peak rich is poor and less is more 
and if the sages are being spooked by the good news news 
for which theyve waited months and which they deemed necessary for 
economic survival its no wonder theyre exaggerating bad 
news of which theyve found plenty 
late last year for instance the pessimists said consumers 
would reduce spending forcing the economy into recession it 
didnt happen then they said an inventory glut might produce 
recession in 1988 but the glut disappeared 
it is ironic that the pessimistic crowd see a boom just as 
bloated inventories are starting to cool things off said 
economist edward yardeni of the prudentialbache investment firm 
who fears neither a boom nor a bust 
throughout there has been wide disagreements among economists 
some of whom believed the biggest threat was from recession others 
that inflation would turn out to be the big problem 
whatever the interpretation however the conclusion has been 
the same ie bad news if the economy expanded it would strain 
production facilities and produce inflation should expansion 
cease recession would follow 
the dramatic improvement in the nations trade deficit a 4 
billion reduction to 97 billion in march provides the most 
vivid example of the syndrome 
nothing economic has been more eagerly awaited in recent months 
since a shrinkage of the deficit means us goods especially 
manufactured items are becoming more competitive abroad 
in fact many economists and investors made the latest trade 
figures the fulcrum of their analyses when the deficit grew in 
february the stock market plunged would a gain in march make the 
market rise 
it didnt happen once again the news though opposite to that 
of february produced a negative reaction both the bond and stock 
markets interpreted the news as indicative of an economy about to 
overheat and produce inflation 
it seems the better things get the worse theyre going to 
be quipped malcolm forbes the publisher who was addressing a 
business luncheon group shortly after hearing the news 
why the mood 
economists themselves have been asking that question and most 
have defended their positions with data and theories that to the 
layman seem thorough reasonable and even sagacious 
while recognizing that pessimism may be justified and that 
inflation high interest rates and perhaps recession lie ahead 
some economists believe there is a large psychological element 
involved 
in fact with so many disproportions and dislocations in the 
economy big budget and trade deficits uncollectable third world 
loans and the crash of the securities markets in october no 
matter how poor or inaccurate an analysis might be a negative 
forecast stands a chance of being correct 
there are also the awful memories of the 1970s to contend with 
economists back then couldnt believe what was happening that 
inflation and interest rates were not just high but in the double 
digits they cannot forget 
and finally anxiety is produced by the very expansion itself 
now in its 66th month it has lived far beyond the usual lifespan 
of expansions and inevitably will turn down but when and will 
inflation or recession end it 
h erich heinemann chief economist for ladenburg thalmannamp 
co a securities brokerdealer remains optimistic at least about 
inflation he notes that major inflation indicators rose less in 
the first quarter of 1988 than in the final quarter of 1987 
his forecast contrasts with that of most economists 
were convinced that with just a little bit of luck the 
expansion could continue into 1991 or 1992 he says adding the 
caveat 
however this will be a respite not a reprieve if washington 
cannot deal with its problems mainly the budget deficit we will 
all have to live with the consequences

california investor burt sugarman on 
wednesday denied he had offered to end his attempt to name three 
directors of media general inc in exchange for control of the 
firms cable television franchises 
media general officials said the offer was made through 
sugarmans financial advisers 
but sugarman said i do not make offers through advisers 
media general knows that all my offers are made in writing to the 
company 
sugarman has offered to buy media general for 70 per share or 
a total of 2 billion 
james s evans president and chief executive officer of media 
general and j stewart bryan iii vice chairman of media general 
and publisher of the richmond news leader and the richmond 
timesdispatch said the proposal to end the proxy contest was made 
monday 
evans said sugarman offered to sell the class a common stock he 
owns or controls about 28 million shares or 101 percent of the 
class a stock in exchange for equity at a bargainbasement 
price in our 163000subscriber cable systems in fairfax county 
and fredericksburg 
evans said the offer which was rejected also included a 
provision by which sugarman would agree to drop his attempt to have 
himself and two business associates harold simmons and david 
gotterer named class a directors at the companys annual 
stockholders meeting friday 
the company has recommended reelection of three directors at 
the meeting 
sugarman in a release from his beverly hills calif 
headquarters called the media general statement a desperate move 
to make it appear as though we are losing the proxy contest in my 
opinion this lastminute trick just wont work 
sugarmans proposal called for him to exchange his stock 
holdings for about 43 percent of a new company formed from the 
cable tv operations while other shareholders could trade their 
shares on a prorata basis for the cable companys remaining 
equity evans said in a statement 
media general employees who own stock in the company would not 
be permitted to own stock in the cable tv company nor would 
members of the bryan family who control media general through 
their class b common shares 
company employees own nearly 10 percent of media general class a 
stock and the bryan family owns 12 percent of the class a stock 
bryan family members also own 70 percent of the class b stock 
which can elect seven directors 
sugarmans proposition is that we value fairfax cable at 300 
million which would clearly be undervaluing that asset by 50 to 
100 percent evans said according to evans sugarmans proposal 
would grant him working control of the system and treat various 
shareholders inequitably 
the media general board saw the offer as greenmail of the most 
egregious sort and quickly rejected it he said 
new york media analyst curtis l alexander who has followed the 
media generalsugarman takeover fight said he would not be 
surprised to see sugarmans pershare offer go up to 75 before 
fridays meeting 
why not he knows he can pay that much and still break up the 
company for a profit alexander said

retailing was one of the few bright spots last 
year in the service sector of the economy according to a new 
survey released wednesday 
fortune magazine in its annual survey of the nations 500 
largest nonindustrial companies found most service companies had 
a rough time in 1987 the october stock market crash brought a 
slump in the brokerage business while savings institutions 
continued to suffer from a rash of bad loans and major commercial 
banks continued to sustain losses on loans to developing countries 
total profits for the 500 biggest service companies dropped 22 
percent in 1987 to 508 billion fortune said by contrast the 
annual fortune 500 survey of the leading industrial companies 
released last month showed a 41 percent jump in profits to 91 
billion 
recent economic statistics such as the us trade deficit for 
march and factory use data for april released on tuesday have 
indicated a resurgence of traditional smokestack industries 
the trade figures included a jump in exports to an alltime high of 
2897 billion which factories have been running at full capacity 
to produce 
service industries on the other hand had few successes in 1987 
other than retailing life insurance and transportation the 
fortune survey found 
shoppers supplied most of the oomph in the service economy 
last year the magazine said by keeping cash registers ringing 
even after many economists thought they would be immobilized by the 
stock market crash consumers carried the 50 largest retailers to a 
9 percent jump in total profits to 828 billion 
top retailers riding the crest of the consumer wave included 
firstranked sears roebuck followed by k mart safeway stores 
kroger and walmart stores 
the companies in the service survey like fortune 500 firms 
were ranked by sales 
american express became the largest diversified financial 
company for the first time in 1987 displacing federal national 
mortgage association which slipped into second place followed by 
salomon aetna life amp casualty and merrill lynch

gordon l smith head of block trading at alex brown amp sons

following tuesdays release of betterthanexpected trade figures 
the commerce department said the nations trade gap shrank more 
than 4 billion in march to 97 billion the lowest monthly 
deficit in three years 
bondholders though view a sharp jump in exports as a sign the 
economy could overheat and generate higher inflation which erodes 
the value of fixedincome investments 
adding to bondholders worries wednesday were reports that the 
federal reserve took between 2 billion and 3 billion out of the 
system mrs reiners said 
she said however it was unlikely the fed was tightening its 
credit policies it just looks like it was technical she said

overnight loans between banks closed at 6 percent down from 6 
percent late tuesday

union carbide corp on wednesday announced 
it was slashing its quarterly dividend by about 33 percent and 
planning an offering of about 15 million shares of common stock as 
part of a recapitalization plan 
the danburybased chemical giant said it would reduce the 
quarterly dividend from 37 cents to 20 cents effective with the 
sept 1 payment 
the combination of high leverage and high dividend payout of 
the past few years is inappropriate for our current business 
strategies said union carbide chairman robert kennedy 
to maintain that combination when financial strength and 
flexibility are required in order to capitalize on the best 
investment opportunities in years especially in chemicals and 
plastics would be shortchanging shareholder value he said 
the company announced the recapitalization plan in november 1986 
he said the common stock offering and its proceeds combined 
with dividend reduction will reduce debt and interest costs and 
lower the companys debttocapital ratio

brazil on wednesday halted talks with 
private bankers on restructuring its 121 billion foreign debt 
because of what it called misunderstandings over the international 
monetary funds role and a clause regarding seizure of brazilian 
assets 
however brazilian officials said there was no impasse in the 
talks and negotiations were expected to continue later 
brazils two main negotiators returned from new york where 
talks were nearly finished with a committee of 14 banks 
representing brazils 700 creditors 
sergio amaral the international representative for the finance 
ministry said talks stalled over the past 10 days due to 
misunderstanding over two issues 
he said brazil wanted to eliminate a condition set by bankers 
that the imf evaluate the brazilian economy every three months as 
has been the practice 
also brazil wanted to alter a clause in the debt restructuring 
agreement which states that in the case of default brazilian 
assets abroad may be seized under court order he said 
amaral did not explain how specifically brazil wants to change 
the clause or if it wants it taken entirely out of the agreement 
amaral and antonio de padua seixas were in new york for three 
weeks putting the finishing touches on an agreement that would 
allow brazil to resume interest payments on the debt the 
developing worlds largest 
seixas said they left because we thought the bankers would 
make a counterproposal and they didnt 
he said the next step before negotiations resumed was for the 
bankers committee to take brazils proposals to creditor banks for 
review 
this is not an impasse it is an opportunity to deepen our 
understanding with bankers amaral said 
in february 1987 brazil announced a debt payment moratorium 
saying the country was unable to meet monthly interest payments and 
needed to restructure its outstanding debt brazil made interest 
payments in january and february this year after progress in debt 
talks 
the agreement being worked on includes a 58 billion loan to 
help pay part of the interest due from 1987 through 1989

fbi agents arrested the former head of the 
collapsed sasson jeans empire wednesday for allegedly threatening 
the life of the federal bankruptcy judge handling his companys 
reorganization 
paul guez the majority shareholder in sasson jeans inc 
allegedly threatened the life of us bankruptcy judge burton r 
lifland who was presiding over the chapter 11 reorganization of the 
apparel licensor in manhattan 
according to a criminal complaint guez 43 threatened to kill 
lifland and other parties involved in the bankruptcy proceeding on 
monday if a result contrary to his interest were to be reached 
i did not threaten anybody i am astonished to see i have been 
accused of this guez told us magistrate barbara a lee during 
a marathon hearing in which prosecutors sought to have him detained 
without bail and guez sought his freedom in order to attend another 
bankruptcy hearing on thursday 
he claimed the charges were part of a conspiracy to block 
his attendance at the confirmation hearing on sassons 
reorganization plan 
ms lee ordered guez held overnight pending a detention hearing 
scheduled to take place before the afternoon bankruptcy hearing 
it wasnt the first time guez has gotten into hot water over his 
combative antics since taking over as his own lawyer in bankruptcy 
court 
lifland has cited guez twice for civil contempt and referred the 
matters to the district court level 
guez is also under indictment for allegedly assaulting a federal 
marshal over bankruptcy proceedings 
the criminal complaint said guez is currently undergoing 
psychiatric evaluation concerning his fitness to stand trial in 
the assault case 
the complaint was based on information supplied by a 
confidential informant described as a lawyer with a privileged 
professional relationship with guez 
the complaint further stated that due to the tone and 
demeanor of guez the informant believed he was fully capable 
of carrying out his threat 
sasson has been in bankruptcy proceedings since october 1986 on 
wednesday lifland approved the sale of the companys name for 8 
million to stanwich partners of stamford conn 
the tunisianborn guez arrived in this country in 1976 with 74 
and a new style of french cut jeans through clever advertising he 
took the market by storm and made millions by licensing the sasson 
label for watches lingerie and luggage as well as jeans 
but the company began to unravel due to internal feuds and 
sasson was swamped by lawsuits leading to the chapter 11 
reorganization
