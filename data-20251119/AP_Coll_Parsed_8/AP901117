the music has improved but iraqs 
propaganda pitch to american soldiers remains the same youre 
risking your life and wasting your time in saudi arabia 
in daily broadcasts on what is now called the voice of peace 
baghdad radios englishlanguage programming contains warnings to 
gis that they risk coming down with craziness from long spells 
in the desert 
it tells them that their arab allies will turn their guns on 
us soldiers instead of iraqis the messages also raise doubts 
about the us role in the region 
gis say they listen to the music but tune out the commentary 
in the tradition of tokyo rose during world war ii and hanoi 
hannah in vietnam iraq started its blend of music news and 
propaganda when the us military buildup began after iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
in the beginning the hourlong programs interspersed arabic 
music and western bigband sounds with taunts 
to the american soldier in the saudi arabia desert a voice 
would say would you like to be one of the cripples who are only 
lamented in the charity ceremonies 
now the programs are three hours long and the music is top40 
contemporary rock and oldiesbutgoodies from the 60s and 70s 
a female announcer dubbed baghdad betty by the us troops or 
a male colleague occasionally interrupts with comments such as 
let us be frank we tell you that the embargo will not affect 
us a bit we could work and prepare food and stuff for ourselves 
like our ancestors did some 6000 years ago 
the embargo is a reference to trade sanctions imposed by the 
united nations after iraq seized kuwait 
on thursday an announcer said one of your pals even killed 
himself a week ago feeling terribly lonely and two gis quarrelled 
with each other and one of them shot his colleague after they used 
to be good friends 
this is only normal for one who is not accustomed to live in 
the desert and is forced to do so for so long a time could easily 
be driven to craziness then suicide is the only way out 
the announcer apparently was referring to a us soldier found 
dead in a shower on nov 8 and the shooting death of a marine the 
next day the us military said he was killed when a rifle 
discharged accidentally as he slept 
the military has acknowledged one suicide among the 46 americans 
who have died since operation desert shield began aug 7 the rest 
were all listed as accidental deaths 
the voice of peace also claimed that a saudi fighter pilot flew 
his plane to asylum in sudan 
this it said illustrated the miserable situation in the 
saudi army it said the kingdoms troops were unhappy with the 
presence of the more than nearly 300000 western military personnel 
in the gulf 
if war breaks out arab soldiers will turn their weapons on 
the enemy and believe me the enemy is not the brave iraqi 
army the announcer said i am not going to tell you who the 
enemy is because i think you should know that by now 
listening to the radio is one of the few diversions available to 
the us troops in saudi arabia where alcohol is forbidden and the 
native women are off limits 
the army has distributed 30000 radios to the troops to help 
them fight the boredom the armed forces started the desert shield 
network last month and began broadcasting a progam of rock 
country jazz and news 
the americans say they listen to baghdad betty and her band but 
are not unnerved by the propaganda 
shes a pain in the butt we just laugh her off said sgt 
1st class frank brickhouse 34 of portsmouth va and the armys 
82nd airborne division she tries to mess with our minds asking 
us why did we come so far to die 
said staff sgt joseph herald 34 of a field artillery unit 
from fort lewis wash as long as she plays good music who 
cares what she has to say

the logistics of bringing up to 
200000 more us troops to the persian gulf region are daunting 
but the man in charge says things are going smoothly 
its going to be a lot easier this time said majgen 
william gus pagonis comparing the new deployment with that of 
the first troops dispatched by president bush after iraq invaded 
kuwait on aug 2 
pagonis the armys logistics chief started with a staff of 300 
and now has about 16000 his team also has more equipment 
the first day we had four buses and about 10 trucks and we 
got everybody to where they had to go the 49yearold general 
said 
now the armys logistical team has about 150 buses at its 
disposal 
the team also has learned from mistakes made in the initial 
deployment pagonis said but he refused to be more specific 
earlier reports indicated most of the new ground troops will 
come from germany including at least two armored divisions with an 
estimated 700 m1a1s the us armys premier tank 
pagonis would not confirm which units are on their way to the 
gulf but he said many of the soldiers will travel from europe 
advance parties have arrived he said coordination is 
taking place and well start the flow and well exceed or meet 
the timetable im very confident of that 
more than 3000 planes have landed and unloaded passengers and 
cargo in saudi arabia since the start of desert shield and 150 
ships have discharged cargo 
theres been no backlog of ships waiting to be unloaded as there 
was in vietnam pagonis said he credited the huge saudi port 
facilities which have handled up to 10 ships at a time and the 
work of the us military crews moving goods off the ships 
the military also has developed a delivery system to get 
supplies to troops scattered across saudi arabias eastern 
province using transportation contracted locally 
on any given day we have 700 host nation trucks on the road 
delivering goods pagonis said 
pagonis said the military receives 120 tons of mail per day it 
is moved from the central post office within 24 hours and delivered 
to the troops in fifteen 40footlong trailer trucks 
the army is serving 150000 hot cafeteriastyle meals per day 
pagonis said 
although many soldiers are still eating only mres the 
readytoeat food that comes in plastic pouches he said his goal 
is to serve hot meals to all troops at least every two or three 
days

president saddam hussein of iraq has 
contended that one reason for his invasion of kuwait was to obtain 
a fair share of oil wealth from his neighbor 
he has attempted to portray the invasion as a battle against the 
rich to benefit the poor but three months into the crisis some of 
the poorer arab countries like yemen jordan and egypt have been 
the first to suffer economic damage 
no matter how the persian gulf crisis is resolved the gap 
between rich and poor in the middle east is likely to persist and 
may even widen 
the middle east has always been a scene of religious and tribal 
disputes and of territorial ambitions the division of wealth has 
also fed nationalist movements and added to the conflicts in 
countries like lebanon iran and in the israelioccupied 
territories 
countries that have little or no oil have always been jealous of 
the oilrich gulf nations to them even billions of dollars in 
financial assistance over the years has seemed like a rich mans 
tip to a waiter in a fancy restaurant 
after iraq seized kuwait on aug 2 the wealthy gulf states 
joined the united states in condemning iraq and helping to build an 
americanled military force in the region 
syria and egypt two nations considered among the poorer arab 
countries also have joined the force they have received billions 
of dollars in return both from saudi arabia and the united states 
but among the palestinians in camps in jordan and the 
israeloccupied territories the dock workers of algiers and moslem 
masses from morocco to yemen there is support for iraq 
they believe saddam has stood up to the western powers and their 
highrolling arab lackeys and the iraqi president has played 
on these feelings in trying to gain support for the invasion 
here is a look at some key nations in the region and the role 
economics plays in their position in the gulf crisis 
saudi arabia the kingdom is reaping a multibilliondollar 
windfall as oil prices and production shoot up the windfall is 
exected to reach 50 billion by years end 
theres also a miniboom among businesses supplying the hundreds 
of thousands of foreign troops stationed in saudi arabia 
but riyadh is spending billions of dollars to expand its 
military and finance the foreign forces it is helping kuwaiti 
refugees and pledged 84 billion in aid by the end of 1991 to 
countries hurt economically by the crisis especially jordan egypt 
and turkey it anticipates an 8 billion budget deficit this year 
jordan half of jordans exports went to iraq and complying 
with un economic sanctions against iraq will cost at least 2 
billion this year and 4 billion in 1991 officials estimate 
jordanian workers in kuwait have lost an estimated 8 billion in 
property and savings jordan has lost millions more in worker 
remittances aqaba which until august was a major port for iraq 
has been idled hundreds of truck drivers are out of work and 
tourism income will be halved to about 230 million dollars 
many jordanians support saddam and saudi arabia has responded 
by cutting off oil supplies to the kingdom 
syria its expected to lose about 4 billion because of the 
crisis officials say in addition it no longer gets money from 
about 200000 workers formerly employed in kuwait but us 
diplomats and analysts say saudi arabia has substantially increased 
its financial assistance by how much is not known 
egypt it will lose an estimated 45 billion this year because 
of the crisis but because egypt produces more than it consumes 
exports this year should be boosted by 1 billion due to higher oil 
prices 
anticipated losses include 24 billion in remittances from 
300000 egyptians who have returned from iraq and kuwait 1 
billion in tourism 300 million in suez canal transit tolls and 
820 million in lower exports and other services 
the government must spend an estimated 700 million in salaries 
medical care and educational expenses for returning expatriates 
the united states and several oilrich arab states have canceled 
14 billion of egypts 50 billion foreign debt cairo is 
approaching other creditor countries with requests for 
cancellations and writeoffs that would reduce it by another 12 
billion 
yemen diplomatic observers fear that the republic formed last 
may by the merger of north yemen and south yemen will split 
between tribes who owe allegiance to saudi arabia and radicals 
supporting the president gen ali abdullah saleh his government 
has been sympathetic to iraq 
that position irked saudi arabia the main benefactor of the 
impoverished state riyadh suspended hefty financial assistance and 
annulled privileges for more than 1 million yemenis there half of 
them have returned home where there is little or no work for them 
newspapers say the red sea country is so hardpressed 
economically that it plans to expel 100000 foreign workers 
the palestinians iraqs invasion has reportedly deprived the 
palestine liberation organization one of baghdads strongest 
supporters of 4 billion that includes plo holdings in kuwaiti 
banks and lost contributions from arab states angry over the 
organizations support for iraq

dorothy spangenbergs laboratory is 
jammed with 20000 jellyfish four times more than usual because 
of nasas delay in launching the space shuttle columbia 
the biologist from eastern virginia medical school plans to send 
2700 tiny young jellyfish on a research mission to study their 
metamorphosis in a gravityfree environment originally scheduled 
for august it was pushed into 1991 when the shuttle sprung 
hydrogen leaks 
those leaks are fixed now and nasa plans to launch columbia in 
early december on an astronomy mission the flight with 
spangenbergs jellyfish columbias next trip is targeted for may 
spangenberg said she needs a large jellyfish supply so there 
will be plenty at the right stage of development when it comes time 
for the mission she expects to have more than 25000 jellyfish by 
spring 
ill just keep growing them until we have enough although i 
dont know how to gauge how much is enough she said were 
going to get as many as we can between now and then 
jellyfish polyps an early form of the animal and about as long 
as the lead tip of a pencil occupy aquariums dishes and flasks in 
spangenbergs norfolk va laboratory the dishes and flasks are 
inside incubators 
each container is filled with artificial sea water that lacks 
iodine and thus prevents metamorphosis polyps can live 
indefinitely at that stage in the laboratory and reproduce 
continuously 
the national aeronautics and space administration has sent up 
monkeys chimpanzees rats flies bees moths spiders and fish 
the soviets have carried a wider variety of animals into orbit 
including dogs tortoises and guinea pigs neither country though 
has ever flown jellyfish in space 
what makes the marine creature so suitable for a nineday 
shuttle mission is that polyps develop into the more mature ephyra 
stage in five to six days when iodine is added to their water 
ephyrae mature within four to six months into the final 
developmental stage called medusa its the form familiar to most 
people the 4 to 5pound animals have bells or humps tentacles 
and long mouth arms 
columbias astronauts will videotape the jellyfish during the 
flight add iodine to the water of some of the specimens and track 
their growth spangenberg will analyze the data 
we need a range of organisms to begin to put together a 
picture to see if the response in space is similar from one 
organism to the next said nasas gary jahns the missions 
payload scientist jellyfish are a single point in that 
picture 
the spacelab life sciences mission which will include a rat 
study and 18 other experiments originally was scheduled for late 
1986 then early 1987 a month after nasa approved spangenbergs 
experiment application in december 1985 challenger exploded and 
the shuttle program ground to a 2year halt 
the delays have proved beneficial for spangenberg in october 
she discovered another kind of jellyfish cell in the ephyra a 
gravity receptor that helps the creatures maintain direction and 
balance somewhat like the human inner ear 
each jellyfish gravity receptor has a sac of calcium sulphate 
crystals just as each inner ear has calciumcontaining crystals 
spangenberg is sending up about 150 ephyrae to see if any calcium 
is lost in the weightlessness of space thirty white rats on the 
shuttle will be observed in a related study 
such knowledge is expected to improve scientists understanding 
of calcium loss in astronauts during flight 
the cells of the jellyfish are basically very similar to cells 
of higher animals spangenberg said i look at them as a good 
model system for the study of a variety of biological problems

the associated press on friday erroneously 
reported the scope of warranty requirements for motor vehicle 
emissioncontrol equipment under the new clean air law in a summary 
of the laws provisions 
the warranty is being extended to 80000 miles from 50000 miles 
for certain equipment not to 100000 miles for all such equipment 
under the new law manufacturers must give a warranty of eight 
years or 80000 miles beginning with 1995 model cars for three 
major emission control components catalytic converters onboard 
diagnostic devices and electronic control systems 
for the remaining emission control system devices the warranty 
period is limited to two years or 24000 miles no change from 
current requirements 
the law does require manufacturers to build converters 
diagnostic systems and electronic controls tostandards equivalent 
to a 100000mile life instead of the 50000 miles now required

now playing in the american work place the slump that stole 
christmas 
in a footnote to a year of corporate layoffs and cutbacks a 
slew of companies are cutting back on the allexpensepaid 
endofyear christmas bash 
this year corporate partygoers will find less caviar and 
french pate shrimp has gone out to sea bid adieu to open bars and 
champagne grab a beer or a glass of wine 
others wont be so lucky many employers pressed by tight 
budgets and economic uncertainty are telling employees theyll 
have to pay for their own celebrations some extravagant company 
affairs have been eliminated 
im finding and a lot of people in the area are finding that 
a lot of companies are canceling parties because they have layoffs 
and cant justify spending money on a party said john caruso 
owner of one of the biggest corporate caterers in the economically 
hardhit boston area 
in new york nbc squeezed by an industrywide advertising slump 
this fall has axed its yule parties for news and other network 
divisions 
i certainly think economics played a part said one nbc 
executive who spoke on condition of anonymity however the 
executive added i think everybodys sort of relieved from not 
having to make the round of parties it was getting out of 
control 
wall street has been particularly merciless in slicing frills 
basically in the downtown district the law bank security 
and financial services industry theres a major statement being 
made on holiday parties said adam weiss director of sales at 
the swank bridgewaters restaurant in lower manhattans south street 
seaport which generally plays host to 18000 partygoers in 
december largely from wall street 
noticeably absent from this years roster of bashthrowers 
fallen junkbond giant drexel burnham lambert which threw a fancy 
350person party at bridgewaters last christmas just months 
before it filed for chapter 11 protection from creditors 
for some companies the cheerless season follows a trend that 
began in recent years for example two christmases ago security 
pacific merchant bank threw an affair with disc jockey open bar 
and a spread of international food featuring a sushi chef on an 
entire floor of its building with about 400 employees in 
attendance 
but last years party while held at a stylish club on 
manhattans upper west side had almost no food and much fewer 
people who attended recalled one employee noting that the party 
was restricted to workers in the firms profitmaking groups 
in atlanta a spokesman at turner broadcasting system inc said 
partly because the company owns its favorite party spot the omni 
hotel it can still afford this year to throw its usual big bash 
for about 1700 employees 
but one major atlanta caterer said the company has slimmed its 
budget for smaller departmental parties many of which require 
partygoers to pick up the tab for items like soft drinks 
caterers say the art of partythrowing increasingly has become a 
waitandsee affair instead of reserving catering halls and 
holiday bands several months in advance many companies have yet to 
commit themselves 
the idea is to wait for endoftheyear profit statements before 
deciding whether theres enough leeway for a party 
uncertainty is this seasons dominant holiday theme shearson 
lehman brothers inc for example informed workers it was 
canceling its major divisional christmas party and then announced 
it would have it after all caterers said but in february instead 
of december 
another way to cut back go for substitutions on the menu 
with caviar costing up to 395 for 14 ounces a fisheggladen 
party supplied by new yorks zabars delicatessen can cost 30 to 
40 a head but for a mere 20 a pound smoked salmon might slice 
the overall cost to 10 a head 
instead of chateau briand it might be top sirloin said lori 
moser one of new yorks top partythrowers we have even done 
some wonderful beef stews this year

houston is the presidents home town new 
orleans is fun cleveland is blue collar tampast petersburg is 
senior citizens and the sun belt san diego boasts the biggest 
cache of electoral votes 
that in a nutshell sums up arguments for the five contenders 
to play host to the 1992 republican national convention 
current handicapping makes san diego the frontrunner to win 
that competition 
in part the southern california city benefits from problems 
peculiar to two of its rivals problems named david duke and ann 
richards 
gop officials insist that former ku klux klansman dukes 
standing as louisianas most prominent if unwanted republican 
does not disqualify new orleans nor does the prospect of ms 
richards as the newly elected democratic governor of texas 
eliminate houston 
but they concede that duke and ms richards are among the 
political factors that will be weighed as the party decides where 
to gather to open president bushs reelection campaign 
so far president bush has expressed no public preference and 
aides say he isnt likely to do so all it takes is a nod from the 
president toward one city to insure its selection 
he has said he wants to go to the place that makes the most 
sense said mary matalin executive director of the republican 
national committee he has not given us a preference one way or 
the other 
the partys siteselection committee plans to make its 
recommendation at the end of this month but the final decision 
wont be announced until early next year 
the democrats already have chosen new york as the site of their 
1992 convention 
no one disputes the importance of california which will have 54 
electoral votes in 1992 onefifth of the 270 needed to win the 
presidency 
neither is there any argument with san diegos ideal weather 
the problems cited most often are the size of the convention 
hall and money 
san diegos hall is the smallest of the five in contention but 
backers contend it is as large as the hall in dallas where 
republicans met to renominate ronald reagan in 1984 there also is 
talk about holding the final session of the convention in the 
california citys jack murphy stadium 
money could be a greater problem normally the major exporter of 
political money to both major parties california will have little 
to spare in 1992 when the state will have two senate races as well 
as contests for seven new house seats 
when republican pete wilson takes office as governor in january 
one of his first acts will be appointing someone to succeed him in 
the senate wilsons choice then will have to run in 1992 for the 
remaining two years of his senate term 
in addition 1992 is the year the seat held by retiring 
democratic sen alan cranston comes up for election 
new orleans was the site of the 1988 convention that nominated 
bush for president the superdome is big enough for two 
conventions also working in the citys favor is what one party 
source called the fun factor 
but the republicans are concerned about the potential for duke 
a state legislator and former klan leader to grab too big a share 
of the television coverage 
despite efforts by national party officials to repudiate him 
duke ran for the senate in 1990 as a republican and garnered 44 
percent of the vote in an unsuccessful bid to oust democratic sen 
j bennett johnston 
if bush had a favorite most republicans assume it would be 
houston his adopted home town but if the republicans meet there 
richards would be the governor who would greet them 
could the news media resist writing and broadcasting excerpts 
from her scathing keynote address at the 1988 democratic 
convention 
poor george she said he cant help it he was born with 
a silver foot in his mouth 
cleveland has its supporters especially after ohio elected a 
republican governor in 1990 choosing it would enable the party to 
showcase its commitment to bluecollar americans a voting group 
that felt more comfortable with reagan than with bush 
tampast petersburg has the drawback of bringing the convention 
to a state that is considered a bush stronghold even though 
florida voters ousted their republican governor in 1990 in favor of 
democrat lawton chiles

the army and marine corps are calling an 
additional 15092 reservists to active duty because of the persian 
gulf crisis 
the latest callups announced friday bring to 51587 the total 
number of reservists activated from all military services since 
president bush first authorized their use for operation desert 
shield in response to iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait 
it is now the largest call to active duty for american 
citizensoldiers since the berlin crisis in 1961 when about 
150000 reservists were activated 
also on friday the marine corps said it was preparing to send to 
the gulf for the first time a tank battalion with m1a1 tanks the 
most modern us battle tank marines now in the gulf are equipped 
with lesspowerful m60 tanks 
the marines said the 2nd tank battalion is now undergoing 
special training before deploying to the gulf with 58 m1a1 tnks 
marine tank units had not been scheduled to switch to the newer 
tanks until next year but the need for firepower to offset iraqs 
numerical superiority in tanks prompted a quicker switch said lt 
col ron stokes 
in a related development defense secretary dick cheney 
announced he was extending a freeze on military construction 
projects except those needed for desert shield 
cheneys announcement drew criticism from some lawmakers rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo chairwoman of the house armed services 
military installations subcommittee complained that cheney was 
holding up projects already approved by congress while starting 
others in the gulf without consulting congress 
bush on thursday used emergency powers to give cheney the 
authority to bypass congress on necessary desert shield 
construction 
the army said it was ordering 14006 national guard and army 
reserve members from 35 states to active duty it said in excess of 
12000 more would be called up within days including the first 
combat reserve units to be activated in the gulf crisis 
the marine corps said it was calling up combat reservists 
including 324 members of the 8th tank battalion in rochester ny 
and 109 members of company b 4th tank battalion in yakima wash 
both of those units will join marine forces that are scheduled to 
deploy to the gulf to perform combat missions 
the army did not say how many of its reservists would be sent to 
the gulf 
the latest army callup which is effective today is the first 
major activation of reserve forces since the bush administration on 
wednesday raised the ceiling on the number of reserves that could 
be used for the campaign against iraq the original limit of 52500 
set in august was raised to 125000 
the army said that for operational security reasons it could 
not say exactly what missions would be performed by the latest 
group of reserves it called up however it appeared from the units 
described in the announcement that they will be used for fuel and 
supply transport medical services and other support roles 
cheney said last week that the army would activate three 
national guard combat units although they would undergo desert 
warfare training in the united states before a final decision is 
made on whether to send them to the gulf 
those three units the 48th infantry brigade mechanized of 
georgia the 155th armored brigade of mississippi and the 256th 
infantry brigade mechanized of louisiana were among the reserve 
units put on alert friday for later callup 
it is expected that the three units accounting for about 12000 
troops will be officially ordered to active duty next week 
meanwhile friday bush formally notified senate president pro 
tem robert byrd dwva and house speaker thomas foley dwash 
of his latest troop deployments 
in my aug 9 letter i indicated that i did not believe that 
involvement in hostilities was imminent and that the buildup 
would facilitate a peaceful resolution of the crisis the 
president wrote my view on these matters has not changed 
the war powers act of 1973 which no president has accepted as 
constitutional requires notice of overseas deployments if 
hostilities are imminent and mandates a withdrawal of troops if 
congress does not approve the action within 90 days the act has 
not been invoked in the gulf crisis

the keating five senators struck emotional 
chords in defense of their integrity as the senate ethics committee 
gave them their first chance to publicly respond to a special 
counsels influencepeddling evidence against them 
sen alan cranston dcalif about to begin radiation therapy 
for prostate cancer invoked the names of his son and sister friday 
and said that with his career nearing an end my cherished 
reputation was on the line in the savings and loan affair 
with all my heart and soul i want to make very clear i 
engaged in no unethical conduct the 76yearold cranston said 
you know that i broke no law you know that i broke no senate 
rule you know that i pocketed no money 
equally spirited declarations were offered by three of the other 
four senators republican john mccain of arizona and democrats 
john glenn of ohio and donald riegle of michigan 
the fifth senator democrat dennis deconcini of arizona gets 
his chance to make an opening statement on monday when the panel 
holds its third day of hearings after he speaks committee special 
counsel robert s bennett will begin presenting witnesses and 
offering evidence 
although no formal charges are pending against any of the five 
the hearings center around their efforts on behalf of charles j 
keating jr former owner of the failed lincoln savings and loan 
whose bailout is expected to cost taxpayers up to 2 billion 
keating was a major contributor to campaigns or causes of each 
senator and each met with federal banking regulators when keating 
was seeking waiver of investment limitations and other regulatory 
actions 
john glenn does not peddle influence period glenn said 
when his turn came 
at no time did i ask for special treatment for anyone he 
said at no time did i trade favors or perform actions in return 
for money i acted honorably i behaved honestly and i have neither 
tainted my own reputation nor tarnished the reputation of this 
body 
riegle chairman of the senate banking committee offered the 
longest personal defense talking for an hour and a half without 
interruption about a case he compared to an exploding cigar going 
off in my face 
i believe my conduct was absolutely proper riegle said 
it was ethical in every respect 
mccain had received the easiest time thursday when bennett 
outlined evidence involving each bennett concluded he found no 
evidence of improper conduct by the arizona republican 
mccain spoke briefly on his own behalf then allowed his lawyer 
to make a pointbypoint rebuttal later mccain took telephone 
calls about the case from viewers live on the cspan cable 
television network 
i know i acted ethically and properly and in compliance with 
all applicable standards of conduct including my own mccain 
told the committee 
bennett concluded his opening description of evidence a 
statement that ran more than seven hours over two days by 
detailing cranstons efforts on behalf of keating 
on approximately four separate occasions senator cranston 
accepted or solicited several hundred thousand dollars from mr 
keating for his campaigns or voter registration drives to which 
he was closely associated bennett said 
each of these four occasions was linked by time and 
circumstance to a request by mr keating for assistance with 
federal bank regulators bennett said 
in his response cranston said his efforts were not tied to 
keatings money and that bennett was suggesting an ethical standard 
had been violated where none existed 
the fact is that the senate does not have any rules like those 
mr bennett seems to want cranston said if it did senators 
would be afraid to act on behalf of any constituents who have 
contributed or who may contribute in the future 
to underscore his point cranston presented a list of all 100 
senators and the staff members each has designated under senate 
rules as authorized to solicit campaign contributions as well as 
conduct senate business 
if you decide that its improper to take a lawful and proper 
action at any time in behalf of someone who has contributed legally 
and properly then every senator including every member of this 
committee had better run for cover because every senator has done 
it cranston said 
cranston has said he will not run for reelection when his term 
is up in 1992 and he has given up his leadership post of senate 
majority whip

a woman says a shotguntoting robert 
jeffrey lujan son of interior secretary manuel lujan loomed over 
her in the nude talked endlessly and forced her to go to a hallway 
outside his parents apartment before he raped her in her own bed 
general district court judge robert ts colby on friday ordered 
the 28yearold lujan who has previous convictions for cocaine 
possession and drunken driving held without bond on a rape charge 
while a grand jury considers the case 
defense attorney robert stanley powell told reporters he expects 
the grand jury to indict his client dec 3 even though this was 
a consentual relationship between two people who lived in the same 
building and knew one another 
but the alleged victim the sole witness at lujans preliminary 
hearing said the first time she ever saw the defendant was when 
she awakened at 441 am sunday not long after she had arrived 
home from an evening of partying the woman 48 said she saw a man 
with a shotgun looming over her bed as time went by i realized 
he had no clothes on she said 
powell repeatedly questioned the womans sobriety that night 
she acknowledged having at least two glasses of wine at a party she 
attended for several hours then at least two kier royales a mix 
of champagne and french liqueur in a 2 am visit to a washington 
nightspot 
by her account lujan told her he picked the locks to her 
apartment with a hairpin and entered it to hide from building 
security for reasons he never explained i assumed it had 
something to do with drugs she said he said he wanted to 
hide but found me attractive and wanted to do more 
the woman said they talked for about two hours during which 
lujan alternately handled the shotgun or left it in a corner of the 
room then lujan after donning his jeans and allowing her to put a 
robe over her nightgown ordered her to accompany him up the 
stairwell to the eighth floor 
there he declared this is so stupid i shouldnt be doing 
this my boss is going to kill me and took her back to her own 
apartment she said 
lujan a house painter lives with his parents on the eighth 
floor of the apartment building in this washington suburb 
upon returning to her efficiency apartment on the third floor 
the woman said lujan repeatedly asked her to take her clothes off 
finally demanding that she do so when she complied he performed 
oral sex on her and then forced her into intercourse she said 
she said lujan left the apartment about 9 am after which she 
went to the front desk and summoned police 
lujan who was arrested wednesday after police scoured the 
building with a composite sketch based on her description sat 
impassively throughout the hourlong hearing as his mother and two 
sisters looked on 
defense attorney powell insisted the woman had known lujan and 
had invited him to her apartment after a chance encounter in the 
elevator after each had returned separately from a night out 
drinking but she denied that account 
powell acknowledged that police had found a shotgun in the lujan 
apartment but disputed that the young man had ever carried it 
during his time with the woman i would suggest to the court that 
a lot of these things happened in her mind he said 
but colby refused the defense attorneys request for bond and 
release of his client to the custody of a local minister who 
operates a halfway house a 2000 bond was revoked a day earlier 
lujan was imprisoned for several months in 1983 for possession 
of cocaine and use of a telephone in a drug transaction he served 
a oneyear term in 1987 for drunken driving and driving on a 
suspended license

the bush administration is considering a new 
assault on government spending by trimming government benefits paid 
to affluent americans but the white house budget chief wants to 
make clear that social security will not be touched 
richard darman director of the presidents office of management 
and budget said benefit reductions going to welltodo americans 
in a variety of programs would be seriously reviewed as the 
administration prepares its fiscal 1992 budget request to congress 
he specifically mentioned subsidy payments to farmers and the 
giant medicare program that provides health care for the elderly 
two areas where the administration has tried in the past to achieve 
cost savings 
but darman branded as inaccurate reports quoting unnamed 
administration officials as saying that the administration was also 
looking for savings in the social security program 
he said the administration had no intention of tinkering with 
social security we are not doing that as part of this review but 
everything else is certainly in the equation 
in remarks friday before the council for excellence in 
government darman said the administration was seriously studying 
proposals to trim government benefits paid to affluent americans 
he suggested that part of the savings could be used to boost 
payments made to lower income individuals 
there are lots of ways you can do that and it varies from 
program to program darman said 
the administration in the past has tried to make higher income 
individuals pay more for their medicare health insurance and to 
reduce subsidy payments received by highincome farmers 
however those proposals have been defeated in congress and 
darman acknowledged in his speech that it was difficult to attack 
benefits received by the middle class because of their political 
might 
but he said the administration may well renew the effort in next 
years budget because of added leverage it received in the 
deficitcutting bill approved by congress last month 
that measure which calls for 492 billion in savings over the 
next five years included new payasyougo enforcement 
mechanisms that darman said should make it easier for the president 
to block unwanted spending 
we may be able to break free somewhat from the consumenow 
promisetopaylater approach that characterized the 70s and 
80s darman said 
but even with the new deficitcutting procedures in place 
darman predicted that the deficit for the current fiscal year would 
hit a record somewhere between 250 billion and 300 billion 
the deficit for the 1990 fiscal year which ended sept 30 was 
2204 billion just short of the alltime high of 2211 billion 
set in 1986 
darman blamed the higher red ink on a variety of factors 
including the weakening economy and the rising cost of the savings 
and loan bailout 
the economys weakness was brought home to the white house this 
week in a seriesof meetings president bush held with his own 
advisers and a group of 20 top business executives brought in to 
brief the president 
darman who attended the sessions said the consensus among both 
the presidents advisers and the executives was that the economy 
was in a downturn a word bush himself used in a television 
interview thursday 
amoco corp chairman dick marrow told reporters there is a 
general feeling that we are either in a recession or very close 
darman said the purpose of the hastily scheduled meetings bush 
has held on the economy was to develop a strategy for cushioning 
the shock of any downturn 
he said the president will probably make recommendations for 
stimulating economic growth in his budget due to be submitted to 
congress in february but that no decisions were likely before late 
december at the earliest

since iraqs invasion of kuwait new doors have 
opened in the west for some of saddam husseins opponents but 
these exiles remain politically divided and scattered around the 
world 
opposition leaders some of whom have opposed the iraqi 
president for more than 20 years say governments in washington 
london and paris are finally starting to pay attention to them 
a few months ago i couldnt hustle up a cup of coffee in the 
us state department said saad jabr leader of the new umma 
nation party a liberal democratic group now i am invited to 
lunch and they want to hear what we have to say 
jabr met senior administration officials during a visit to 
washington in august and the washington post published an 
interview with him 
jabr and his group are well known to people here and they have 
no qualms about meeting with him state department spokeswoman 
diane salisbury said 
a foreign office spokesman in london said there had been regular 
contact with some iraqi opposition groups before the aug 2 
invasion the number of groups seeking meetings has risen since the 
invasion and the foreign office is happy to hear their views said 
the spokesman 
jabr estimates about 200000 iraqis are in britain most exiles 
keep a low profile fearing persecution by saddams secret 
services 
saddam was a leader of a coup that took power in iraq in 1968 
he has violently crushed dissent since becoming the countrys top 
leader in 1979 
hoshyar zebari of the kurdish democratic party said iraqi kurds 
were wellreceived in september when they met in paris with a 
deputy of french foreign minister roland dumas 
belatedly western governments are recognizing saddam has to 
be moved and they are encouraging opposition groups inside and 
outside iraq to stand up and be counted said middle east analyst 
heino kopietz formerly of the international institute of strategic 
studies in london 
but the opposition movement remains badly divided the broad 
ideological sweep of the opposition groups some of them historical 
enemies makes a united front difficult they have also been 
weakened by saddams purges 
kopietz said the iraqi resistance has suffered from the lack of 
a charismatic leader and he doesnt see these groups leading 
saddams overthrow 
more than two months of talks among 25 opposition groups in the 
syrian capital damascus have produced agreement only on the 
necessity of toppling saddam not on what comes afterward 
communists and moslems have fallen out over the wording of 
communiques the moslems want to include references to allah the 
communists refuse 
iraqi opposition groups fall loosely into four camps the 
democrats who have tended to congregate in london arab 
nationalists and dissidents from iraqs ruling baathist party who 
consider damascus their home shia islamic groups centered in 
tehran and the kurds a longoppressed minority fighting for 
autonomy against baghdad kurdish political parties have 
representatives in many countries 
attempts to unite have foundered on differences of allegiance 
and approach 
jabrs new umma party is not taking part in the damascus talks 
because it believes the venue is not neutral and that syrias 
president hafez assad may seek to exploit the crisis to lead the 
arab world 
jabr is also suspicious of the iranian mullahs influence on 
iraqs muslim opposition groups when the mullahs say jump the 
muslims say how high he said 
the opposition all want saddam to withdraw from kuwait but arab 
nationalists and others demand the simultaneous withdrawal of the 
usled force from the persian gulf some democratic groups want 
the united states to help democratize the region after kuwait is 
freed 
the opposition is also divided on whether a viable opposition 
exists inside iraq 
dont let anyone tell you there is an organized opposition 
inside iraq said jabr ninety percent of people inside iraq 
oppose saddam but after 22 years of terror it is a silent 
opposition 
but zebari said the kurds internal front at least is still 
active there are several thousand guerrilla fighters inside the 
country who are fighting on and thousands more in iran and 
turkey he said

president bush in a lastminute flurry of 
domestic business before heading to europe vetoed legislation to 
thwart chemical weapons proliferation barred us mineral activity 
in antarctica and acted on a spate of other bills passed by 
congress 
the president vetoed a measure designed to crack down on 
countries and companies that traffic in chemical arms but at the 
same time he issued an executive order he said would achieve the 
same goals 
the order imposes new export controls on chemical and biological 
weapons and provides sanctions against violators 
in a statement bush said his major objection to the legislation 
is not the requirement of sanctions but the rigid way in which 
they are imposed 
the mandatory imposition of unilateral sanctions as provided 
in this bill would harm us economic interest and provoke friendly 
countries who are essential to our efforts to resist iraqi 
aggression he said 
the bill congress sent bush also would have forbidden trade with 
cuba by overseas subsidiaries of us companies a provision that 
the state department opposed 
bush directed sanctions against foreign countries and their 
citizens who use chemical or biological weapons or are making 
substantial preparations to use such weapons or have deeloped or 
stockpiled such weapons in violation of international law 
the sanctions include cutting off us foreign aid and arms 
exports blocking loans to the country from international lending 
organizations and restricting us imports from the country 
the president signed the antarctic protection act of 1990 and 
eight other environmental measures 
the new law bans indefinitely us mineral activities in 
antarctica until congress approves a yettobenegotiated 
multinational minerals pact for the frozen continent 
environmental groups want bush to commit the united states to 
join france australia and new zealand in pushing to make 
antarctica a permanently protected refuge 
us officials oppose the permanent ban urging instead an 
international compact for a limited moratorium on oil drilling and 
other minerals development environmentalists contend that the 
indefinite ban merely gives industry time to prepare the technology 
for eventual development and mining 
bush also signed measures to 
establish the florida keys national marine sanctuary 
designating 2600 square miles off the keys as a national marine 
sanctuary 
establish national wildlife refuges in the 18000acre bayou 
cocodrie in louisiana and the 7500acre walkill river area of new 
jersey and finance additional marine research programs and 
steppedup enforcement by the environmental protection agency 
designate 83100 acres in southern nevadas mojave desert as 
the red rock canyon national conservation area 
nearly triple the size of the coastal barrier resource system 
by adding 818000 acres along the atlantic gulf of mexico and 
great lakes coasts the measure also limits federal funds for 
development within the coastal barrier areas and requires that any 
federal property in the coastal barrier regions be transferred to 
the system 
provide grants and training to teachers for environmental 
education and create an office of environmental education at the 
environmental protection agency 
fund research on the global warming trend the administration 
bucking many of its allies contends there is insufficient 
scientific data to confirm that the earth is slowly warming due to 
gaseous emissions rather than committing itself to a reduction of 
those gases the administration is putting more money into 
research 
assist in the cleanup of toxic pollution in the great lakes and 
lake champlain between new york and vermont 
upgrade airport security and develop guidelines to warn 
passengers of terrorist threats 
spend 287 million for the national community service act to 
encourage community service and volunteerism 
enact the excellence in mathematics science and engineering 
education act to establish a variety of fellowships training 
programs and grants to foster and improve education in those 
fields the bill authorizes 150 million for such programs in 1991 
bush vetoed the indian preference act of 1990 which would have 
established a program to direct contracts and grants to indian 
enterprises he said the bill would impose new expensive and 
often duplicative program responsibilities on the interior 
department which administers indian reservations 
because congress is not in session the president needs only to 
withhold his signature from a bill to constitute a veto a process 
known as a pocket veto

the stench rising from a suburban 
chicago hog farm will soon be just a rank memory but a neighboring 
banks claim for 250000 in damages lingers on 
tenant farmer douglas daniels agreed in an outofcourt 
settlement announced thursday to remove his 85 pigs from the 
11acre property by dec 12 
in turn buffalo grove will drop complaints that the farm was a 
public nuisance and an offensive and unwholesome business 
first american bank of lake county in buffalo grove still wants 
250000 in damages to compensate its alleged losses in new 
customers and new loans during the five months daniels raised pigs 
across the street 
daniels lawyer robert boehm called the damages claim 
preposterous boehm said daniels was hospitalized with 
pneumonia and unavailable for comment 
bank attorney jeffrey braiman said friday there had been a 
substantial decline in use of automated teller machines located 
outside the bank and he said the foul odor from the pig farm 
detracted from employees enjoyment of their workplace 
many times they could not even have lunch in the bank because 
the smell was so overpowering braiman said we think it has 
injured the business and injured the reputation of the bank 
were happy its settled said phillip w versten 
administrative assistant for buffalo grove a community of about 
35000 people 30 miles northwest of chicago 
daniels agreed to vacate the property because the owners joseph 
and patricia petrillo found a likely buyer for the land and 
because daniels hogs will be ready to market in early december 
boehm said 
first american said it would press both daniels and the 
petrillos for damages 
the petrillos lawyer james graney said the banks damages 
claim was unfounded a trial on the matter was set for dec 17

a virginia national guardsman was left behind 
when his unit was sent to the middle east even though he failed to 
gain a court order to block his deployment to saudi arabia 
officials say 
medical tests have been ordered for sgt michael r ange and he 
will remain at fort lee va base spokeswoman joy whitmore said 
friday anges army national guard unit the 1450th transport 
company was deployed to the persian gulf on wednesday 
anges request for a temporary restraining order was blocked by 
a federal judge in washington on tuesday ange had sought to block 
his deployment on grounds that president bush lacked congressional 
authority to wage war against iraq 
ange 26 a former beaufort county nc police officer is now 
a student at appalachian state university in boone nc he also 
claims that he is medically unfit for military service because of 
knee leg and foot problems as well as an ulcer 
ange claims the army began proceedings to discharge him because 
of his medical condition long before his reserve unit was activated 
last month 
whitmore said the decision to keep ange at fort lee was in no 
way a concession by the army of its legal right to ship the soldier 
to the persian gulf 
ange chalenged to the presidents ability to send troops to the 
middle east without either notifying congress under the 1973 war 
powers act or obtaining a declaration of war as spelled out in the 
constitution 
the resolution requires presidents to notify congress within 48 
hours of sending troops to an area where hostilities are imminent 
the troops must be withdrawn in 60 days without congressional 
approval 
bush who last week ordered another 200000 us troops to join 
the 230000 already in saudi arabia this week told lawmakers that 
he has not decided whether to use force against iraq 
the 1973 act was passed over the veto of president nixon and 
every chief executive since then has maintained the law is 
unconstitutional in previous cases courts have been reluctant to 
enforce the act saying the dispute is a political matter between 
the president and congress 
us district judge royce lamberth refused to issue the 
temporary restraining order but said the case raised a difficult 
legal question and scheduled a dec 10 hearing on anges motion 
for a permanent injunction

a federal court has struck down the 
agriculture departments testing of workers suspected of offduty 
drug use leaving in doubt the future of a broader federal program 
in its friday decree the us court of appeals for the district 
of columbia circuit became the first federal appellate court to 
rule on whether the government may test employees suspected of 
offduty drug use that does not affect onthejob performance 
in a case involving white house employees however the court 
ruled that government officials with access to secret 
information may be subject to random drug testing along with 
officials with top secret clearances 
in the usda case the threejudge panel struck down regulations 
under which employees of the agencys food and nutrition service 
could be tested if they were suspected of offduty drug use even if 
it did not impair job performance 
because usda regulations authorize urinalysis testing of 
ordinary employees who are not suspected of onduty drug use or 
impairment and because those regulations mandate needlessly 
intrusive testing procedures we find them unconstitutional the 
court said 
while the ruling involved one component of usda it has 
governmentwide implications because most federal agencies have 
adopted similar drug testing programs said elaine kaplan an 
attorney for the national treasury employees union which brought 
the case 
the ruling means that in order to drug test the vast majority 
of federal employees the government has to have individualized 
suspicion f onduty drug use or onduty impairment caused by drug 
use ms kaplan said this is a significant limit on what they 
were trying to do 
the panel in an opinion by circuit judge abner mikva said 
the government has not produced evidence that might establish a 
relationship between offthejob drug use and government efficiency 
or on general integrity and deterrence rationales 
the government may investigate and punish wrongdoing within 
the walls of its offices mikva wrote 
what the government may not do in the case of ordinary 
employees is justify drug testing procedures that intrude upon 
constitutionally protected privacy interests with speculation about 
possible future job impairment or rules violations 
mikva was joined by circuit judges laurence silberman and harry 
edwards 
the ruling which partially reversed a lower court opinion also 
struck down a portion of the regulations that allowed usda 
officials to monitor employees while they provide urine samples 
without any suspicion that a worker might tamper with the specimen 
before it was tested 
the court called this an invasion of privacy 
the panel upheld random testing of usda drivers because drug use 
might endanger public safety 
in the other case the same panel over edwards dissent upheld 
a policy of randomly testing employees of the executive office of 
the president holding secret security clearances courts had 
previously upheld random drug tests of employees with top 
secret clearances 
american civil liberties union attorney arthur b spitzer said 
the case means that any government employee with a secret 
clearance will eventually be subjected to random drug testing 
its another diminution of important constitutional rights 
because of the antidrug hysteria spitzer said 
edwards said that this case is not the first fourth amendment 
casualty claimed by the war on drugs nor in all likelihood will 
it be the last 
i fear todays decision finds us unwilling to do what we must 
to preserve fundamental fourth amendment freedoms

thick pasty lava once oozed onto the 
surface of venus to form 15milewide domes that look like giant 
pancakes or coconut macaroons in the magellan spacecrafts newest 
pictures 
heat measurements made by the spacecraft show fools gold or 
other ironrich metallic minerals coat the slopes of the planets 
tallest peak 7milehigh mount maxwell 
scientists released new radar pictures friday during a news 
conference at the national aeronautics and space administrations 
jet propulsion laboratory 
engineers were relieved they were able to regain contact with 
the spacecraft after a 40minute blackout thursday it was the 
third such communications failure in three months project manager 
tony spear said it could happen again but called magellans health 
very good 
some pictures show 600milelong 300milewide horseshoeshaped 
features each surrounding a meteorite impact crater 10 miles to 15 
miles wide 
the horseshoes may have been formed by shock waves triggered by 
incoming meteorites or by windblown debris that settled to the 
ground after being kicked up by the impacts said geologist ray 
arvidson of washington university in st louis 
they are unique in the solar system he said 
the space agency also displayed a computerprocessed videotape 
that shows venus surface from the perspective of someone swooping 
over 130milewide halfmiledeep volcanic collapse craters and 
38000foottall mount maxwell the planets tallest mountain 
one of the new pictures shows seven lava domes similar but much 
larger than the lava dome inside the crater of mount st helens in 
washington state said steve saunders magellans chief scientist 
they look like coconut macaroons they look like pancakes 
he said theyre about 2500 feet high and 15 miles across 
magellans heat measurements show some of the middle slopes of 
mount maxwell contain mystery material that emits little heat 
said gordon pettengill of the massachusetts institute of 
technology 
that means the slopes are coated with soil containing metallic 
material either iron pyrite called fools gold because it looks 
like gold or iron minerals called hematite and magnetite 
pettengill said 
radar pictures show numerous mountain ridges and valleys created 
by squeezing of venus hot thin crust said sean solomon of mit 
in places the mountains are no longer being squeezed upward and 
are collapsing down onto lowland plains he added 
magellan was launched from space shuttle atlantis on may 4 
1989 arrived at venus on aug 10 and formally started mapping the 
planet sept 15 
magellan has used radar to peer through clouds and map 18 
percent of venus landscape comparable to an area on earth 
stretching from los angeles to reykjavik iceland and covering 
most of north and south america 
thursdays loss of contact with magellan halted mapping for most 
of the day engineers still dont know the exact cause but suspect 
excess static sometimes disrupts one of magellans computers spear 
said 
those malfunctions and other problems will add about 3 million 
to 5 million to the 744 million cost of magellans mission spear 
said

atlantis astronauts on a secret 
mission have deployed a surveillance satellite possibly to spy on 
iraq 
a news blackout ordered by the pentagon prevented nasa from 
discussing the flight but sources speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the spy satellite was released friday 
published reports have said the spacecraft will either eavesdrop 
on communications or conduct photo surveys of the persian gulf 
where iraq invaded kuwait in early august and the united states 
promptly sent troops 
the air force reportedly modified the satellite to spy on the 
persian gulf region while atlantis was grounded this summer because 
of hydrogen leaks 
but nasa remained mum about the mission breaking the public 
silence just briefly friday to announce the five astronauts would 
land at edwards air force base calif sometime between 5 pm and 
8 pm est monday a more precise time will be announced 24 hours 
before landing 
the crew is doing well and the orbiter atlantis continues to 
perform satisfactorily said mission control commentator kari 
fluegel 
atlantis with an allmilitary crew commanded by air force col 
richard covey blasted into orbit thursday night 
the mission is the second shuttle flight in two months 
discovery flew last month when a nuclearpowered probe was 
dispatched on a journey to explore the suns poles 
the national aeronautics and space administration had planned to 
fly nine missions this year but several flights have been delayed 
because of hydrogen leaks detected aboard atlantis and columbia 
they were cleared for flight last month 
columbias longdelayed astronomy mission now is scheduled to 
launch in early december if successful it would be the sixth 
shuttle flight this year

four central intelligence agency employees 
have been fired in an investigation of the sale of valuable 
mistakenly printed postage stamps the agency said 
the cia said friday night that five other employees were 
disciplined in unspecified ways 
the case arose when the cia purchased 95 of the 1 stamps at the 
mclean va post office for its own use in 1986 
the stamps showed an oil lamp but the ones bought by the cia 
had the body of the lamp upside down such misprints can be 
extremely valuable to stamp collectors 
the nine employees sold 85 of the misprints to a new jersey 
dealer giving the dealer one torn stamp each employee kept one 
stamp now worth a reported 17000 each and one of the nine 
employees is believed to have lost his stamp 
the four employees who were dismissed were fired for lying to 
investigators misappropriating government property and failing 
to return a number of valuable stamps purchased with agency funds 
after they were directed to do so said spokesman mark mansfield 
the dismissals were ordered reluctantly only after all 
alternatives were fully explored and this resolves the case from 
our point of view he said

the government has agreed to help children 
fathered and left overseas by american soldiers to make contact 
with their longdeparted parents 
the national archives and a british group war babes on friday 
released details of a draft settlement of a 2yearold lawsuit 
intended to force the archives and defense department to help 
children separated from and sometimes unknown to the fathers 
the agreement was signed for the government thursday and filed 
in federal court by jay b stevens us attorney for the district 
of columbia and joan s meier washingtonbased lawyer for war 
babes a birmingham englandbased organization of 300 sons and 
daughters of american fathers 
final court approval is expected the breakthrough in the case 
came when judge thomas penfield jackson in july ordered the 
pentagon in its defense to produce affidavits from fathers 
declining contact from their offspring ms meier said 
the settlement begins to redress the wrongs that started 
during the world war ii when the army encouraged men to have a 
good time and then prevented them from marrying the mothers of 
their children and whisked them away so they could not be found 
ms meier said 
she added that the settlement will help all children of american 
veterans who want to know their fathers including those from the 
korean and vietnam wars 
war babes sought to establish that the right of children to 
information under the us freedom of information act took priority 
over the privacy act 
the pentagon has cited the privacy act to refuse requests to 
help reach veterans or active members of the armed forces even 
where the names and service numbers were provided 
calling the settlement a significant victory for families the 
world over war babes said the pentagon had maintained that 
fatherhood of an illegitimate child during youth is at worst 
embarrassing and at a minimum highly personal contact by a 
longlost illegitimate child is clearly intrusive whether welcome 
or not 
shirley mcglade the founder of war babes said in an affidavit 
filed in the case that several fathers have been traced and 
contrary to the us government position in almost every case 
the father welcomed his child often with great joy 
the government agreed in the settlement to forward certified 
mail from a son or daughter to the father at the last address 
listed in the national personnel records center operated by the 
archives under pentagon direction 
if the father has died the government agreed to disclose the 
address in returning the letter in other cases the city and state 
but not the street address will be provided ms meier said 
ms mcglade was the daughter of a welsh woman and an american 
soldier who left not knowing her mother was pregnant she said she 
found her father in california with the help of a us radio 
program and his friends 
attorney meier said thousands of sons and daughters in england 
alone could be affected by the settlement not all cases involve 
illegitimate births she said mentioning the sudden separations 
that occur during a war

members of native groups in borneo islands sarawak 
region the worlds largest producer of tropical wood say they 
are suffering from hunger and water pollution because of excessive 
logging 
friends of the earth an environmental group representing the 
natives said friday that nearly half the regions trees have been 
cut down a study says the rest could disappear in seven years in 
sarawak a malaysian state on nrthern borneo 
the native groups in tokyo for a meeting of the international 
tropical timber organization on friday criticized japan and 
tropical wood importers for violating their traditional rights over 
vast areas of forest in the malaysian state 
we are short of food we hardly find anything from the jungle 
as we used to but the itto pays no attention said jok jau 
evong head of a kayan residents association in uma bawang in 
eastern sarawak told reporters 
in the past it was still easy to live off the land since the 
timber companies came the fruits edible plants and shoots were 
all damaged water pollution has killed the fish said juwin 
lehan who heads a penan group in the area 
the loss of the forest has caused massive erosion and 
sedimentation of rivers and creeks leading to flash floods the 
water is contaminated and there are increasing reports of diarrhea 
and cholera said aster soong of friends of the earth malaysia 
an official of the international tropical timber organization 
speaking on condition of anonymity said the issue would be 
discussed monday in a forum at itto headquarters in yokohama near 
tokyo 
sarawak has a population of 13 million people and a land area 
of 49000 square miles about the size of new york state 
restrictions on timber exports from neighboring countries like 
thailand and indonesia have accelerated cutting in sarawak in the 
past three years making it the worlds largest producer of 
tropical wood 
last year sarawak produced 543 million cubic feet of logs up 
from 455 million cubic feet in 1988 over half of sarawaks wood 
exports are imported by japan 
friends of the earth an environmental group representing the 
natives says that only 60600 square miles of malaysias original 
117700 square miles of forest land still have trees 
at the current rate of logging about 2700 square miles a year 
the nations primary forest will be depleted in seven or eight 
years according to a report by the university of malaysias botany 
department 
increased cutting has put loggers and natives some of whom 
still live as nomads in the forest in direct confrontation with 
each other 
native groups have attempted to prevent logging by setting up 
blockades and making appeals to government leaders so far with 
little success jok jau evong said 
we are the people who have been there for many generations 
somebody who just came yesterday is trying to get all the resources 
and we have no rights he said 
a recent itto mission to investigate conditions in sarawak said 
that log production must be reduced by 30 percent or 105 million 
cubic feet a year to prevent depletion of the forests it also 
recommended that forest management be improved 
but friends of the earth and the native groups accused the 
mission of not thoroughly investigating the environmental impact of 
logging and said the recommendation would not save the forests 
they are demanding a moratorium on all logging until policies 
are changed to prevent further damage to watershed areas and to 
protect the rights of people living in the forests

international scholars deciphering the dead sea scrolls have 
chosen a new chief editor hoping to speed up work on the ancient 
manuscripts the incumbent called the move a power play by academic 
rivals 
the scholars appointed emmanuel tov to share duties with editor 
in chief john strugnell and complete work still unfinished about 
four decades after the documents discovery 
once you get to a point where a whole generation who has 
looked forward to getting published are getting older and dying 
the level of frustration gets higher said eugene ulrich 
theology professor at university of notre dame 
the dead sea scrolls first discovered in 1947 in a cave in 
presentday israel are considered one of the richest religious 
libraries ever discovered from the period that gave birth to 
christianity and modern judaism 
they date from about 100 bc to ad 70 and contain the oldest 
known copies of the old and new testaments other biblical 
writings literature and poetry 
scholars editing the scrolls voted by mail in october to appoint 
tov of jerusalems hebrew university to share duties with 
strugnell of harvard divinity school said frank cross of harvard 
university another member of the editing team 
the israeli department of antiquities which proposed tov is 
making an alarming attempt to wrest publishing rights from 
current researchers strugnell said in a telephone interview 
thursday he wouldnt offer specifics but said he will fight tovs 
appointment 
tovs appointment has not been announced but strugnell said the 
israeli agency mailed notices to scholars earlier this month it 
was expected to be formally announced to about 5000 theologians 
and archaeologists at the american schools of oriental research 
convention in new orleans this weekend 
cross called strugnell ineffective there has been general 
criticism both inside the team and out it is not by chance that 
this move is being made he said 
the incumbent defended his program as being on schedule and said 
rivals are trying to grab power from him 
strugnell said he would agree to appoint a deputy editor in 
chief but not a coeditor i dont see how it can be shared he 
said 
the shakeup is the latest in a years of academic dispute over 
who should control publishing rights to the scrolls 
the first fragile documents were discovered by a bedouin 
shepherd in a cave near the dead sea many manuscripts which 
contained mainly old testament books were published immediately 
many other documents unearthed uring the next 10 years in 11 
caves remain largely undeciphered and unpublished strugnell said 
the remaining documents as much as 45 percent of the total 
discovery should be published by the year 2000 
the manuscripts particularly those discovered in 1952 in the 
fourth cave at qumran were found in fragments ranging from the 
size of a dime to the size of a human hand 
eight scholars headed by strugnell and overseen by the israeli 
department were given exclusive publishing rights to the scrolls 
which remain sealed in aluminum boxes in the rockefeller museum in 
jerusalem the team was expanded in the mid1980s but still 
numbers fewer than 15 
ulrich in a recent telephone interview said strugnell has not 
inspired others to work faster 
you can certainly say that one would expect one volume to have 
appeared from strugnell in the course of this time ulrich 
said 
strugnell blamed the slow pace on the painstaking task of 
piecing together the fragments which can only be read under 
infrared photography and a lack of ample funding 
other scholars like james vanderkam of north carolina state 
university have offered unpublished photographs of the documents to 
other professors vanderkam said that has helped quiet some 
criticism 
people just seem to have lost their initial zeal vanderkam 
said thats why its a good idea to pass it on to others

donald trump christened the lavish taj mahal 
casino less than a year ago as the showpiece of his bigbucks 
empire now its headed for bankruptcycourt protection 
trump and his taj mahal bondholders agreed friday to a debt 
restructuring that will temporarily place the plush atlantic city 
nj gambling palace under bankruptcycourt protection and give 
the investors half ownership 
the deal was reached more than 12 hours after trump missed a 
473 million interest payment on 675 million in junk bonds used 
to finance the casino 
some details of the agreement were still to be worked out but 
bondholder representatives said it contained several incentives for 
trump to improve the performance of the taj mahal 
its very much a carrot and stick approach here that weve 
adopted said robert miller an attorney for the bondholders 
trump at a news conference with his aides and representatives 
of the bondholders group said the result is turning out to be a 
very positive one 
still the flamboyant developer who once prided himself as a 
masterful businessman with enormous wealth looked grim during the 
news conference held in another one of his swank properties the 
plaza hotel in manhattan he didnt shake hands with any bondholder 
representatives 
the arrangement was the latest reversal for trump whose 
reputation as a jetsetting financial genius was shattered as new 
yorks economy soured and he slid into multibilliondollar debt 
the taj mahals bondholders had threatened to push trump into 
bankruptcy proceedings and seize control of the casino 
under fridays compromise trump and his investors agreed to 
restructure the debt in what is known as a prepackaged 
bankruptcy filing that will let the casino emerge from court 
protection within weeks negotiators said 
the interest rate on the bonds will be reduced to 12 percent 
from the current 14 percent and bondholders initially will receive 
50 percent of the stock in the casino 
of the 12 percent interest 10 percent must be paid in cash and 
2 percent in bonds but if trump is able to pay the original 14 
percent interest his stake in the taj mahal will increase to 80 
percent the maturity date on the bonds will be extended from 1998 
to 2000 
the deal also requires that the taj mahal operate within 15 
percent of its budget or trump must turn control of it over to the 
bondholders 
the cashstrapped trump billed the 3acre gaming hall the 
eighth wonder of the world when he opened it april 2 but it 
has been unable to take in the 13 million a day that industry 
analysts say is required for it to break even 
the 1 billion resort more than twice as large as any other 
atlantic city casino opened during an economic downturn that has 
placed financial pressure on several of new jerseys casinos 
trump owns three casinos there the taj mahal trump castle and 
trump plaza and all have highyield junk bonds outstanding the 
problems at the casinos as well as the depressed new york real 
estate market left trump strapped for cash and helped bring on his 
current financial woes 
the developer who now owes an estimated 2 billion to banks 
has been negotiating with his creditors since last spring to keep 
from losing his many properties

backers of former contras who have 
occupied buildings and blockaded roads to pressure the government 
will plot new strategy if talks produce no results this weekend a 
spokesman says 
mayor armando incer of boaco one of 18 southeastern towns 
supporting the exrebels protests said friday his movement wants 
no government militarism and material aid for the disbanded 
nicaraguan resistance so it can integrate into civilian life 
goverment commissions and mayors continued negotiations friday 
to end the occupations and blockades along the rama road the only 
route between the capital managua and the atlantic coast 
incer said that without progress in talks his movement will 
meet sunday to consider new measures he did not elaborate 
police fired tear gas to break up a blockade by about 60 
protestors friday at the roads midpoint of juigalpa 90 miles east 
of managua 
the disbanded contras and their supporters have been blocking 
the area all month to demand that president violeta chamorro live 
up to promises of aid to the former guerrillas she made when they 
agreed to disarm 
the contras had fought a usbacked 9year war against mrs 
chamorros predecessors the former sandinista administration 
her insistence on allowing sandinista leaders to maintain 
control of the army and police has become a central complaint in 
the blockades 
the dismissal of the ministers of interior and presidency and 
the head of the army were at the top of a 12point list of 
negotiation demands spokesmen for the dissident mayors presented in 
a news conference friday 
also on friday lawmakers gave a vote of confidence to mrs 
chamorros attempts to handle the rash of disturbances without 
violence 
in strengthening law and order the use of the mechanism of 
dialogue and consensus reaches adequate solutions to political and 
social conflict said a statement approved by 70 deputies with 
three abstentions the remaining members of 92seat assembly were 
absent during the vote 
we condemn violence wherever it comes from and support the 
search for peaceful solutions the lawmakers said 
the army has been called out one time during the series of 
conflicts that has claimed at least 24 lives and left dozens 
wounded 
troops were deployed wednesday to end a blockade at sebaco 50 
miles north of managua after four police were killed and 23 other 
people were injured in a shootout 
mrs chamorro has warned however that she will call out the 
army if unrest continues

iraq may have three superguns designed to fire 
114pound shells up to 465 miles and hit several neighboring 
capitals but its not known if the guns are operational a 
newspaper reported today 
the independent citing unidentified us intelligence sources 
reported the guns were made from parts manufactured by british 
companies and delivered to iraq before the iraqi project was 
uncovered by british customs officers last april 
there was no immediate reaction from officials in iraq britain 
or the united states cities such as jerusalem tehran iran and 
the saudi arabian capital of riyadh are within 465 miles of iraq 
on april 12 british customs officers seized eight large 
sections of steel tubing at teesport dock in northeast england the 
tubes were about to be shipped to iraq 
the iraqi government and the manufacturer sheffield 
forgemasters of rotherham in northern england said the tubes were 
for an iraqi petrochemical plant 
military experts at the time said the tubes appeared to be part 
of a barrel for a huge gun 
but the independent reported further customs investigations 
revealed the tubes were part of a ballistic test bed for a plan 
to fire satellites into space 
it said the satellite plan was named project babylon and that 
the supergun project 839 grew out of it 
also in april turkish customs officers seized a 30ton steel 
cylinder from a truck heading for iraq british customs officers 
said they thought this was also due to form part of an iraqi gun 
other suspected parts were seized in greece and italy 
on thursday charges against two men accused of breaching 
britains arms embargo against iraq were dropped at sheffield 
magistrates court both denied any knowledge of the alleged gun 
a lawyer for the department of customs and excise told the court 
there was not enough evidence to bring a successful prosecution 
against businessman peter mitchell the agency also did not wish to 
proceed against metallurgist christopher cowley 
mitchell 43 had been charged with illegally exporting 
equipment he is managing director of forgemasters walter somers 
ltd manufacturers of the pipe found in turkey 
cowley 52 faced two similar charges of organizing illegal 
exports press association the british domestic news agency 
reported that cowley is a former project coordinator for 
canadianborn us artillery expert gerald bull 
bull slain by a gunman in brussels belgium on march 22 was 
reportedly hired by iraqi president saddam hussein to design a 
supergun 
the independent reported that belgian police and justice sources 
believe the killing was linked to agents of mossad the israeli 
security service 
it said walter somers and sheffield forgemasters built three 
satellite guns for project babylon it said the design work was 
completed by cowley who worked for bulls belgiumbased space 
research corp 
it added project 839 was the work of an src company and it 
borrowed heavily on the research conducted over the years by dr 
bull most important 839 was a gun in every sense

recording was common knowledge at the record company 
everyone at arista who worked closely with the group was 
walking on eggshells before the grammy lipsync performance last 
february headlee told the times 
when they walked off the stage clutching the trophy i 
remember thinking to myself that they may not have deserved the 
grammy for their performance but they sure as hell did deserve an 
oscar headlee added 
roy lott executive vice president of arista denied the 
entertainers account 
there is now way that anyone ever could have know whether they 
sang or not lott said we are merely a distributor of their 
records rob and fab and frank assured us that they sang on the 
record 
a call seeking comment from davis on friday night was not 
returned

dickman of richmond ind i used to like them but not now 
radio station wlolfm in minneapolis said it was milli vanilli 
free and would no longer play the album 
farian says he was forced to go public with the revelations when 
the boys told him they wanted to sing on the followup record 
i said no i dont go for that sure they have a voice 
but thats not really what i want to use on my records farian 
said wednesday 
in a statement thursday the two said they have been ready

about 2000 people including 
150 priests attended a mass marking a year since the massacre of 
six jesuit priests a case in which army officers were arrested 
but have yet to go to trial 
the central american head of the jesuit order said at the 
outdoor mass on friday that worldwide attention to the massacre 
should be forged into support for the underprivileged in the third 
world 
the developed worlds solidarity will not be authentic as long 
as it is limited to supporting us the jesuits while 
alienation poverty and injustice continue to batter the 
disenfranchised said the rev jose maria tojeira provincial for 
the roman catholic society of jesus 
six priesteducators their housekeeper and her daughter were 
slain on nov 16 1989 an army colonel three lieutenants and four 
soldiers are under arrest and charged with the murders but the 
case has not yet gone to trial

11year salvadoran civil war that has claimed more than 73000 
lives mostly civilian 
the army lost half of its 85 million in us military aid 
planned for 1991 because congress was unhappy with el salvadors 
progress in prosecuting the jesuit murder case 
el salvadors far right considered the jesuits subversives for 
their contention that the guerrilla war against a series of 
usbacked governments stems from injustice repression and 
poverty rather than international communist expansion 
seventeen bishops including four us prelates cocelebrated 
the mass in a parking lot at the university of central america 
where the slain priests taught 
portraits of the martyrs hung from a wire stretched above the 
altar the revs ignacio ellacuria ignacio martinbaro segundo

itll be the big house instead of the 
penthouse for a college dropout who lived the good life on bad 
checks and unpaid credit cards 
anthony defelippis 21 was ordered to spend 37 months in 
federal prison as punishment for a crosscountry spending spree of 
more than 100000 he was convicted on felonies for bank larceny 
and making false statements to a bank 
i think the only explanation would be the statement out of 
control defelippis said during his sentencing hearing 
us district judge michael mihm cited defelippis unrepentant 
attitude in levying the lengthy sentence defelippis blamed his 
problems on his failure to attain a college degree and didnt 
express remorse for his crimes during his hearing thursday 
the convictions resulted from a series of bad checks overdrawn 
credit cards and misrepresentations made to bankers in the two 
years since defilippis a new jersey native quit bradley 
university in 1988 
after dropping out of school his only employment then was a 
parttime job in new jersey that paid him 4000 over four months 
but records show he fancied silk suits traveled in limousines 
took a joy ride in a helicopter and charged the rental fee to the 
chicago brokerage company where he hoped to work 
he succeeded in running up a 100000 tab on his american 
express credit card and accruing large debts on other credit cards 
according to court testimony authorities said he left a string of 
creditors in chicago los angeles new jersey and florida 
defelippis was arrested in chicago in march 1989 on a federal 
warrant resulting from his application for a 250000 loan at a 
peoria bank on his application he fraudulently claimed to have a 
2 million annual income prosecutors said 
fbi agents began tracking him when he returned to the bank to 
check on his loan applications status he caught a plane to 
chicago and was picked up by chicago police while trying to make a 
large credit purchase at neiman marcus records indicate 
he has been held without bond since july 1989 he pleaded guilty 
to the charges in april

the federal aviation administration has 
ordered northwest airlines to examine 11 of its planes for possible 
safety defects according to a published report 
the faa warned that an instrument critical to controlling the 
plane has jammed at least six times on a320s operated by foreign 
carriers and in test flights the minneapolis star tribune 
reported today the problem involves loss of trim control which 
would affect the noseup and nosedown angle of the airplane 
the star tribune reports that documents obtained under the 
freedom of information act indicate the problem could be even worse 
if the loss of the electrical trim actuator was coupled with 
malfunctions of two onboard computers that help maneuver the 
plane 
this condition if not corrected could result in loss of 
control of the airplane say faa documents 
airbus industrie manufacturer of the a20 and northwest said 
the problem can be managed and chances are slim that there would be 
a combination of events leading to total loss of control 
northwest is the only us carrier flying the europeanbuilt 
plane which features a sophisticated flybywire control 
system that relies heavily on computers northwest has ordered 89 
more of the planes 
phoenixbased america west airlines is adding a320s to its 
fleet which would make it subject to the same faa directive

unjustifiably detained be they iranians americans europeans or 
lebanese sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah said 
this whole file should be closed because it is a humanitarian 
issue fadlallah said in a statement released by his press 
office 
it was the second such plea in two days by the cleric 
to those who think that releasing the hostages would be in 
favor of the western states we say it would be in favor of 
humanity which is not separate from islamic values he said 
fadlallah is the spiritual guide of the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god the umbrella organization for 
underground shiite factions believed holding most of the 13 
westerners in lebanon including six americans 
more than 300 shiite moslems are held at the khiam prison in 
south lebanon controlled by the israeliaffiliated south lebanon 
army militia several of them are hezbollah fighters 
hezbollah says an undisclosed number of its members are held by 
christian militias in east beirut 
relatives of four iranians who disappeared in lebanons 
christian enclave in 1982 arrived in lebanon tuesday in an effort 
to obtain information they say they had information the four were 
held at a prison run by christian warlord samir geagea in the 
faraya ski resort northeast of beirut 
geageas lebanese forces militia said the four were killed by 
rival christian chieftain elie hobeika 
fadlallahs past statements encouraging the release of foreign 
hostages appear to have had no tangible effect on the kidnappers 
despite the influence of his religious authority 
but when a group calling itself organization islamic dawn 
released americans robert polhill and frank reed in april it said 
the releases were partly due to the behests of senior religious 
leaders

winstonsalem nc ap the testimony of nurses was credited 
with convicting a woman sentenced to death for spoonfeeding her 
boyfriend arseniclaced food 
our nurses were wonderful witnesses prosecutor janet branch 
said friday after a judge ordered blanche taylor moore 57 to die 
for killing raymond reid with poisoned peanutbutter milkshakes and 
banana pudding while he lay in a hospital bed four years ago 
obviously mrs moore made an attempt to make an impression on 
them ms branch said thus she did and the nurses very 
reliable memories four years later were probably responsible for 
the conviction 
the same jury that convicted mrs moore of firstdegree murder 
on wednesday recommended the death penalty on friday after 
deliberating four hours forsyth county superior court judge 
william freeman set the execution date for jan 18 1991 death 
sentences in north carolina are automatically appealed 
as the jurys recommendation was read mrs moore sighed and 
said very quietly my god 
if her appeals fail mrs moore would choose between death by 
gas or lethal injection 
defense attorneys said they expect to do better during their 
appeals 
our belief is this verdict and judgment will not stand the 
scrutiny of the appellate court defense lawyer mitchell mcentire 
said its round one of a difficult fight 
mrs moore also is charged in the poisoning death of her first 
husband james taylor in 1973 and the poisoning of her estranged 
husband the rev dwight moore who became sick after their 
honeymoon last year but survived she may be tried later on those 
charges 
reid of kernersville died in october 1986 at north carolina 
baptist hospital in winstonsalem he was 50 
investigators began looking into the deaths of reid and taylor 
after doctors discovered last year that mrs moores estranged 
husband had been poisoned 
prosecutors said during the fourweek trial that mrs moore was 
driven by a need for money and that she killed reid to gain part of 
his estate

an agreement could be completed this weekend 
that would mark a major breakthrough in a twodecadeold effort to 
compensate thousands of people injured by asbestos fibers a lawyer 
said 
victims would be compensated according to the severity of their 
illness rather than a highly criticized system under which claims 
were processed based on the time of filing 
peter angelos a baltimore asbestos victims attorney involved 
in restructuring negotiations said friday the majority of a 
sevenmember committee of plaintiffs lawyers had approved the 
plan 
the deal would also have to be approved by us district judge 
jack b weinstein who earlier this year ordered the overhaul of 
the manville trust fund set up to compensate asbestos victims the 
trust has 130000 claims pending 
a restructuring would cap a year of turmoil that began when the 
trust said it had run out of cash to pay future claims and that 
some asbestos victims would not be compensated until well into the 
next century 
leon silverman the new york lawyer appointed by weinstein to 
restructure the trust declined comment friday 
the manville trust was created in 1988 as part of the bankruptcy 
court reorganization of manville corp which declared chapter 11 
six years earlier because it couldnt meet its liability from 
asbestos lawsuits 
denverbased manville was once the nations largest asbestos 
manufacturers 
asbestos is a mineral used widely for decades in shipbuilding 
contruction and other industries it later was found to cause lung 
cancer and other serious and often fatal diseases

president mikhail s gorbachev today proposed a 
government overhaul that would give republics more influence and 
could force out prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov who has resisted 
swift reform 
the move appeared to be a concession to gorbachevs main rival 
and frequent critic russian president boris n yeltsin who had 
demanded a coalition government and ryzhkovs resignation 
speaking to the supreme soviet legislature gorbachev also said 
an emergency program will be drafted within two weeks to deal with 
growing food shortages he did not give details 
in todays 12minute speech gorbachev elaborated on some of the 
ideas he introduced in a speech friday that speech came at the 
demand of lawmakers who insisted the president give an emergency 
report on the state of the union 
gorbachevs proposals aim to calm growing discontent over the 
countrys collapsing economy and the increasing rebelliousness 
among the republics all but one of which have made declarations of 
sovereignty 
i appeal to citizens of all 15 republics to support these 
undelayable measures gorbachev said today the separatist 
movement must be stopped he said we cannot break up the 
union we cannot go down this path 
gorbachev did not make it clear whether he could implement the 
proposals on his own or if they needed ratification by soviet 
lawmakers 
but anatoly lukyanov chairman of the supreme soviet told 
legislators that the 2250member congress of peoples deputies 
which meets next month would have to approve any constitutional 
amendments for government restructuring 
under gorbachevs proposals the council of ministers headed by 
ryzhkov would be replaced by several bodies under direct 
presidential control the principal ruling body would be the 
federation council which would include representatives of the 
republics 
legislators generally welcomed the proposed elimination of 
ryzhkovs job but unless the republics agree to join the 
federation council the restructuring is unlikely to solve the 
paralysis of power in the country 
initial reaction from some republics was negative 
an estonia lawmaker said her republic and the two other baltic 
states of latvia and lithuania would not join the council 
we will not take part in any old or new institution which is 
an institution of federation marju lauristin deputy speaker of 
estonias parliament told reporters 
she suggested the restructuring was an attempt to establish a 
dictatorship 
it is concentrating all power in the economy in politics in 
military affairs in one persons hands she said 
the baltics have said that their incorporation into the soviet 
union in 1940 was illegal and have launched independence drives 
gorbachev said the federation council formed in march would be 
strengthened and would meet more regularly 
out of a consultative body it should be transformed into an 
effective structure to coordinate the efforts of the center and the 
republics he said many republics have nullified national 
legislation and presidential decrees and have declared their laws 
supreme the new structure was designed to end such conflicts 
ryzhkov told reporters he had no idea what new role he might 
have in the new structure and said he learned of it only 20 
minutes before gorbachevs speech but he said his job was being 
eliminated 
i understood that the position of chairman of the council of 
ministers wont exist there will be presidential rule a 
presidential cabinet ryzhkov said 
politicians demonstrators and commentators have demanded 
ryzhkovs resignation for at least a year yeltsin has said the 
country cannot solve its economic crisis as long as ryzhkov and his 
cabinet were in place 
asked if he were willing to remain in a government job ryzhkov 
told reporters i will work as long as the people need me 
ryzhkov 61 was appoined head of the council of ministers in 
september 1985 previously he was director of the uralmash machine 
building complex in the ural mountains city of sverdlovsk 
the federation council comprised of the leaders of the 15 
republics and headed by gorbachev has been meeting only 
sporadically and has not taken a major role in policymaking 
gorbachev said that with the strengthening of the federation 
council the 18member presidential council created last march to 
implement domestic and foreign policy would be eliminated 
to strengthen law and order which many soviets have complained 
is breaking down gorbachev said that presidential representatives 
will be appointed and sent to regions of the country 
under recent constitutional amendments gorbachev has the power 
to impose direct presidential rule in restive areas of the country 
the soviet leader appeared to be moving closer to this step with 
the announcement of the stationing of his representatives in those 
areas

communist deputies stalked out of 
parliament as legislators overwhelmingly approved a bill turning 
communist party property over to the state czechoslovak media 
reported today 
all but one communist lawmaker left the parliament session in 
protest refusing to take part in friday nights vote the lidove 
noviny daily reported 
the state ctk news agency said the measure was approved by 101 
of the 103 deputies present and voting in the house of the people 
one deputy voted against it and one abstained 
in the second chamber the house of nations 52 of 55 deputies 
present and voting in the slovak chamber cast ballots in favor all 
55 czech deputies approved the new law 
the measure was introduced in the house friday by deputy premier 
pavel rychetsky who stressed that the partys debts to society 
are much higher than the value of the property that is now under 
discussion 
last month the government proposed seizing all communist party 
property without compensation in a move pointing to growing anger 
at the former rulers at a time of economic hardship 
czechoslovak media said last month that communist property is 
worth about 2375 million a year after the peaceful revolution 
that ended communist rule 
government officials said communist assets totaled 512 million 
before the revolution the communists themselves valued their 
remaining property at 94 million 
the government froze party assets on may 18 starting the 
process of gradual transfer of property to the new authorities 
party property includes many buildings communications 
equipment recreation centers newspapers and other assets 
several communist deputies called for ammendments to the bill 
and others rejected it 
miroslav ransdorf a deputy of the communist party of slovakia 
charged the bill was aimed at distracting attention from the 
economic crisis weakening the opposition and boosting the 
flagging prestige of the civic forum movement 
ransdorf also charged that the bill was designed to destroy the 
communist party economically lidove noviny reported 
president vaclav havels civic forum and its sister organization 
in slovakia public against violence are the largest groupings in 
parliament and the senior partners in the government coalition 
political differences within the civic forum over whether it 
should continue as a loose movement encompassing a wide spectrum of 
political views or become a political party have hurt its 
popularity 
czechoslovaks go to the polls next weekend to vote in municipal 
elections 
prior to the formal voting all communist deputies except 
miroslav jansta left the assembly 
the communists have given up their leading role and ideology 
more easily than their property lidove noviny commented 
the communist party voted last november after huge 
antigovernment street demonstrations to drop from the 
constitution the partys guaranteed leading role which had ensured 
its domination of society and politics for 41 years

king hussein who has been reluctant to 
side with the west in the persian gulf crisis today harshly 
criticized the united states for applying what he called double 
standards in the persian gulf crisis 
addressing the opening session of parliament the king suggested 
any solution to the gulf standoff should be linked to the 
arabisraeli conflict iraqs saddam hussein has taken the same 
position 
the jordanian monarch also assailed the usled military 
buildup in the gulf region and told lawmakers he hoped jordans 
strained relations with saudi arabia and other gulf states could be 
mended soon 
staterun jordan television and radio carried the kings 
40minute address live government offices declared today an 
unofficial holiday and allowed employees for voluntary leave if 
they wished to attend the parliamentary session 
the 80member chamber of deputies elected a year ago in 
nationwide general elections met jointly with the 40member senate 
to hear the speech the king spoke from his throne wearing a 
blackandgold ceremonial military uniform 
jordan has condemned iraqs aug 2 invasion of kuwait but also 
is seeking an end to israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip captured from jordan in 1967 the territories are land 
claimed by the palestinians 
this duality forces us to inquire why there has been 
incessant refusal to link the two crises despite the fact that 
resolutions have been adopted by the united nations he said 
the king facing an economic crunch as a result of the gulf 
crisis renewed an appeal for financial assistance from gulf 
states formerly his main financial backers as well as emergency 
aid from the international community 
jordans relations with gulf states suffered because it dragged 
its feet in complying with the united nations sanctions against 
iraq the amman government says it now enforces the embargo except 
for crude oil that jordan receives 
jordanian officials say their economy would be crippled without 
the iraqi oil which is a form of debt payment pegged at 16 a 
barrel 
in apparent reference to the united states and its allies in the 
antiiraq coalition hussein accused unnamed world powers of 
blatant and shameless conduct in the gulf region saying greed 
was their main motive 
their actual goals stem from the desire to control our destiny 
and the arab nations resources he said 
criticizing the military buildup in the region he denounced 
unyielding positions and economic strangulation in the gulf 
he attacked the wests complacent stand toward israeli 
aggression while assuming the role of defenders of international 
legitimacy and human rights 
the king also affirmed he would continue to support the 
palestine liberation organization in all possible ways

sixth on the union treaty the common denominator of our 
approach and our understanding is that the union must be renovated 
and preserved there were speeches with or without references to 
lenin yesterday first divide then unite if what is meant and 
comrade boiko is quite correct here is a division of competence 
and powers qualitative renovation of the entire system of vertical 
and horizontal relationships i think it would be supported by all 
of us including me personally but i am categorically against a 
fragmentation of the state a redesigning of territorial divisions 
destroying centuriesold relationships of people it is easier for 
me to say this now our own bitter experience tinged with the blood 
of our citizens has i think taught us that we cannot separate 
applause that is why we must not embark on that road without 
delay and with all due attention we must tackle the division of 
powers and authority implement everything that is contained in our 
concept of renovating our multiethnic state if there is oxygen 
the health of all nations will be good i think that the supreme 
soviet must speak out in favor of it and the people must be 
informed about its position 
the draft of the union treaty is basically ready we will submit 
it as soon as possible to the supreme soviet of the union and the 
supreme soviets of republics and dont let us be intimidated by 
the newly emerging fighters for sovereignty who say that the 
people are saying so and so the people should be asked first 
applause it was done in the ukraine at the most critical periods 
and there were never less than 70 percent of those who supported 
preserving and renovating the union the same happens everywhere i 
am even now getting reports from georgia they were very concerned 
when they heard statements that ties are being torn that it took 
centuries to establish 
seventh i think it necessary to stress once again the 
importance of giving more attention to the problems of the army to 
social security of the members of the military and their families 
the army is the child of the people i am repeating the formula 
which has provided our point of reference for years once again i 
am appealing to the supreme soviet to make laws without delay to 
make it possible for the army to perform its functions and to 
ensure the prestige of those who safeguard the security of our 
state 
eighth it is our duty to help maximum coordination and 
interaction of soviets it obviously follows from yesterdays 
discussion that neither the supreme soviet nor local soviets can 
operate efficiently without the closest coordination and 
interaction it is in the interests of our common cause that we 
reject confrontation fruitless competition

president bush celebrating the 
first anniversary of the revolution that toppled czechoslovakias 
communist rule promised this struggling nation today that we 
will not fail you in this decisive moment 
america will stand with you he vowed in a speech to the 
federal assembly just hours after arriving here for the first ever 
us presidential visit and again to a rally in wenceslas square 
site of many turning points in czechoslovakias turbulent history 
bush also vowed the west would not leave eastern europe in a 
military no mans land 
bush also tied the past year of revolution in europe to the 
crisis in the persian gulf saying i have this feeling in my 
heart that no peoples understand better what is at stake in the 
gulf than czechs and slovaks 
you know from your own bitter experience that the world cannot 
turn a blind eye to aggression you know the futility and vain hope 
that aggressors can be appeased he said 
president vaclav havel said czechoslovakias own history has 
taught us ample lessons about the consequences of appeasement 
onethird of czechoslovakias territory was ceded in 1938 to the 
nazis in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent adolf hitler from 
conquering other countries 
it is necessary to resist evil it is necessary to resist 
aggression the onetime dissident said 
bush also said the united states would not leave the fledgling 
democracies of eastern europe dangling with no security we do 
not want to see czechoslovakia poland and hungary off in some 
kind of no mans land he said now that the sovietled warsaw 
pact has turned into a political rather than military alliance 
bush said the united states has an enormous stake in the 
security of eastern europe a subject that will be addressed in a 
summit next week of 34 nations in paris 
bush said he and havel did not discuss future security 
arrangements in any detail although he did say it came up he 
suggested the conference on security and cooperation in europe the 
group sponsoring next weeks paris summit would take a more active 
role in determining europes direction in the post cold war era 
the two leaders were wrapped in heavy topcoats against the 
overcast chill of the prague afternoon at the rally more than 
100000 people crowded into wenceslas square and down its long 
rectangular boulevard to hear bush and havel who laid wreaths at a 
popular shrine to those who died under communism 
havel said his nation still faces difficult struggles in trying 
to move from a communist to a capitalist society 
he said the fact remains that dissatisfaction nervousness 
insecurity and disillusionment are widespread in our society 
bush by contrast was upbeat 
czechoslovakias revolution is over bush said its 
renaissance has just begun your nation like your neighbors to 
the north and south faces the unprecedented task for building 
stable democratic rule and a prosperous market economy on the ruins 
of totalitarianism 
the president declared i am here to say that we will not fail 
you in this decisive moment 
he said final agreement was reached today allowing 
czechoslovakia to enjoy the benefits of mostfavorednation trade 
status permitting it to deal with the united states at the lowest 
possible tariffs and import fee rates bush said he also would ask 
congress for 60 million to create a fund to spur us investment 
here 
moreover bush said funds to help build the private sector would 
be drawn from the 370 million already committed for central and 
eastern europe for the coming year 
noting that czechoslovakia and its neighbors are braced for 
seere energy problems bush said he had asked the international 
monetary fund to lend up to 5 billion in 1991 to central and 
eastern europe the world bank will commit an additional 9 billion 
over the next three years bush said 
on a political note bush said he agrees that prague should be 
the home of the permanent secretariat of the csce the 
looselydefined 34nation assembly that served as a forum for 
eastwest talks during the cold war 
it is right that this city once on the fault line of cold 
war and conflict now at the heart of the new and united europe 
play a central role as the csce seeks to expand the frontiers of 
freedom in europe bush said 
bush setting out on an eightday trip to europe and the middle 
east arrived here to a 21gun salute american and czechoslovak 
flags snapped in the wind in the courtyard of the castle where 
havel and bush held talks a military honor guard stood resplendent 
in new navy uniforms modeled on the garb of west point replacing 
the drab green sovietstyle uniforms of the communist era 
clusters of wellwishers many of them waving american flags 
stood along the streets of prague to greet bush 
prague was the first stop on a journey that also will take the 
president to germany a 34nation summit in paris a thanksgiving 
day visit with troops in saudi arabia and talks in cairo with 
egyptian president hosni mubarak 
this wideranging trip will take us from the salons of europe 
to the sands of saudi arabia bush said in a statement each 
stop is meant to bolster the peace freedom and prosperity that 
americans enjoy and for which we should give thanks throughout the 
year 
the centerpiece of the visit to europe will be the signing on 
monday of a treaty slashing nonnuclear weapons the most sweeping 
agreement in history to reduce weapons arsenals yet bush said the 
highlight of the whole trip would be spending the thanksgiving 
holiday with us forces 
upwards of 250000 american troops have been deployed to the 
gulf and bush has ordered an additional 200000 to go there to be 
ready for a possible war with iraq over its invasion of kuwait

prime minister nikolai i ryzhkov who would lose 
his job in the government overhaul proposed by president mikhail s 
gorbachev set ambitious goals when he took the post in 1985 
one of his first and toughest tasks was to trim the bloated 
bureacracy inherited from the era of stagnation under the 
leadership of leonid i brezhnev 
gorbachev initiated the political and economic restructuring 
known as perestroika shortly after he became leader in 1985 
and ryzhkov was a key lieutenant in implementing reforms 
but the 61yearold prime minister has not always agreed with 
his boss sometimes i clashed with him on practical issues he 
said in an interview last summer with the magazine arguments and 
facts 
during his fiveyear tenure ryzhkov eliminated 25 ministries 
and dozens of other central officers were dismantled in the 
interview he described efforts to pare down the entrenched 
bureaucracy as a battle royal 
nevertheless it was the same bureaucracy that he climbed 
through to reach the post considered the second most powerful in 
the country 
ryzhkov was born on sept 28 1929 to a miners family after 
graduating from the urals polytechnical institute with a degree in 
engineering he began working in 1950 at the giant uralmash 
machinebuilding complex in sverdlovsk twenty years later he 
became its directorgeneral 
he joined the communist party in 1956 and became active in 
politics with his appointment to the supreme soviet commission on 
planning and budget in 1974 in 1981 he became a full member of 
the partys central committee 
in 1985 six weeks after gorbachev became general secretary 
ryzhkov was appointed a full member of the communist party 
politburo he was named chairman of the council of ministers in 
september of that year 
during his first years as prime minister ryzhkov was largely 
regarded as a faceless technocrat until he took control of a 
highprofile politburo commission overseeing relief efforts for 
victims of the december 1988 earthquake in armenia 
thanks to his tv image many thought ryzhkov a soft and 
irresolute man the novosti news agency said in a 1989 profile 
that was so until the armenian earthquake at the end of last 
year the world then saw another man the mask of reservation fell 
to reveal frankness and undisguised passionate pity 
but his popularity proved shortlived 
blame for the abysmal economic conditions sweeping the country 
was laid at his feet for the past year supreme soviet lawmakers 
demonstrators and intellectuals have demanded the resignation of 
ryzhkov and his government 
almost each parliamentary session over the past year began 
with demands for the resignation of the government and this 
session hears the same demand ryzhkov told lawmakers saturday 
all this prevents the normal functioning of the supreme 
executive power body he said the atmosphere created around 
the government in fact dooms its decisions to 
nonimplementation 
ryzhkov appeared philosophical about the imminent demise of his 
job saying he only learned of gorbachevs proposals 20 minutes 
before they were presented to the supreme soviet 
i understood that the position of chairman of the council of 
ministers wont exist there will be presidential rule a 
presidential cabinet he said the job of vice president 
included in the gorbachev proposal was not offered to him ryzhkov 
said 
despite the uncertainty of his future ryzhkov said he supported 
gorbachevs restructuring plans 
but he said things will be just as tough under the new setup 
as they were under his government 
it will be just as hard for them as us because our life is 
such ryzhkov said we really are at a pivotal stage when the 
old structure is still being broken down and the new one is being 
born

us secretary of state james a baker iii said 
today his talks with three african nations yielded positive results 
in lining up support for a resolution authorizing the use of force 
against iraq 
zaires foreign minister kalimba wakatana mushobekwa said his 
government would back such a resolution if it were introduced in 
the united nations security council 
yes we support it he told reporters 
baker also met with the foreign ministers of ethiopia and the 
ivory coast before heading to paris to lobby the foreign ministers 
of romania finland britain and the soviet union on the proposed 
resolution 
i think weve had a positive day consulting with other members 
of the security council baker said but refused to elaborate 
i dont want to get into the business of counting votes here 
or predicting results or anything like that but weve had some 
good meetings today he said 
at the end of the weekend baker will have met with foreign 
ministers of eight of the 15 nations that are members of the 
security council where a resolution on the use of force would have 
to be approved 
baker has maintained that the united states has not yet decided 
if it will seek the resolution which would authorize the use of 
military force to get iraq out of kuwait if peaceful means failed 
i havent seen a draft resolution yet he said here 
saturday 
even so the united states appears prepared to circulate by the 
end of the month the resolution in the security council as a last 
resort to drive iraq out of kuwait which it has occupied since 
aug 2 
us officials have said they would like to introduce the 
resolution this month while holding the chairmanship of the 
security council 
diplomats at the united nations said baker is lobbying foreign 
ministers from the security council nations to vote in person on 
any useofforce resolution 
the ministers would lend weight to the resolution and bolster 
the image of allied unity if they turned out for the vote since 
they seldom occupy their countries seats on the council except in 
very grave situations 
are we now on the margins of the council discussing a new 
resolution that would turn the screws on saddam hussein the answer 
is yes canadian ambassador yves fortier said friday 
thirteen foreign ministers attended sept 25 when the council 
voted 141 to expand its economic embargo to include specifically 
all air cargo traffic in or out of iraq and kuwait 
however most were already in new york for the general 
assemblys first week of debate and the world childrens summit 
several foreign ministers attended the july 1987 security 
council meeting that adopted the ceasefire and peace plan for the 
iraniraq war resolution 598 
baker has already conferred with joe clark canadas external 
affairs minister and broached the idea of the foreign ministers 
coming to new york according to fortier 
the americans may wish to stress the importance of the 
meeting by holding it at the ministerial level fortier said 
america and the soviet union both have drafted use of force 
resolutions according to diplomats in new york and washington 
officials 
there are a number of concepts that are in play fortier 
said 
diplomats say the us version would contain some kind of 
ultimatum it would refer to authorizing use of force at some point 
in the near future when economic sanctions on baghdad have 
tightened 
european diplomats who saw the soviet document say it would put 
heavy reliance on the sofar passive military staff committee of 
the security council the sources spoke on condition of anonymity 
that committees function under the un charter is to 
advise and assist on its military requirements including the 
employment and command of forces placed at its disposal

events of the last 100 days have cost 
impoverished sudan the support of egypt the united states and 
wealthy gulf arab countries basically all thats left are handouts 
from moammar gadhafis libya 
the isolation comes as it becomes increasingly likely sudan will 
face a famine that western relief officials say could threaten up 
to 11 million people 
sudans troubles began when lt gen omar hassan elbashirs 
military government found itself on the other side of the persian 
gulf crisis from its most important friends 
paying back old political and military debts elbashirs junta 
refused to condemn iraqs invasion of kuwait on aug 2 that 
alienated most of khartoums friends who are demanding that iraq 
quit kuwait 
traditionally the sudanese could rely on its big brother to the 
north egypt to bail it out of trouble for two decades food and 
other aid from the united states and the west have kept the country 
going through flood famine and political turmoil 
and saudi arabia and kuwait the first now a bitter enemy and 
the second an occupied country had provided hundreds of millions 
of dollars to help develop an agricultural potential once 
considered the greatest in africa 
one of the juntas few allies since the invasion has been 
gadhafi the libyan strongman 
hes promised to shore up sudans tottering central bank with 
100 million hes sent 40000 sacks of cement to restore schools 
damaged by floods in 1988 hes pledged to build a system of paved 
highways in khartoum a sprawling dusty city of mainly dirt roads 
additionally col youssef abdul fatah khartoums deputy 
commissioner said libya donated 10 huge electricity generators 
to be used in emergencies and to help in pumping water to some of 
the capitals districts 
welcome as it is such largesse does little to make up for the 
loss of western and arab support 
the invasion cost sudan at least 2 billion in lost remittances 
from 20000 workers who were brought home from iraq and kuwait by 
the sudanese government 
the minister of expatriate affairs alsaeed osman mahjoub said 
the repatriated people suffered at least 500 million in personal 
losses like abandoned belongings in kuwait and iraq 
and the juntas economics overseer col salah aldeen karar 
told the official sudan news agency the country is being ignored 
weve notified international organizations of our losses and 
demanded to be treated on an equal footing with countries 
economically affected by the gulf crisis like jordan and egypt 
he said 
but the world is proving unsympathetic to demands that khartoum 
be compensated for dislocations to the economy the message is that 
sudan made an uncomfortable bed by siding with iraq but it will 
have to lie in it 
in october sudan invited gadhafi as guest of honor at a 
ceremony announcing the countrys future system of government not 
surprisingly it resembles closely the libyan jamahiriya based 
on gadhafis theory that people should rule themselves through mass 
meetings not through elected representatives 
the juntas debt to gadhafi was so great that he was allowed to 
suggest on national television unchallenged that religion 
should be distanced from politics if brought together they 
spoil each other 
sudans basic law is the islamic sharia a 1400yearold legal 
and ethical code and junta leader elbashir is a devout moslem 
with leanings toward the fundamentalist national islamic front 
although it like other political parties has been banned since his 
coup on june 30 1989 
in the same speech gadhafi told the sudanese a northeast 
african merger of their country egypt and libya could become a 
great world power he attacked the west for laughing at his ideas 
during his october visit gadhafi also threatened to intervene 
in sudans drawnout and expensive southern civil war unless the 
rebels stop fighting 
the junta clings to the hope of a solution by force and last 
month once again used the food weapon bombing foodstocks to starve 
the rebels the decision drew criticism from the united states and 
other governments who earlier ignored similar activities by both 
sides 
possibly the decision hardest to explain is the juntas adamant 
refusal to acknowledge that famine stalks the countryside again 
even after a governor in western sudan declared his region a 
disaster area 
the denial instigated another fight with washington and made 
western relief officials seethe without a government appeal 
famine relief cannot be organized

newly united in a shared belief in 
democracy europe is leaving behind the hostility of the cold war 
and embarking on what it hopes will be an era of peace and 
prosperity 
this weeks summit in paris of 34 nations the united states 
soviet union canada and all of europe except isolationist albania 
attending only as an observer has been compared to the 1815 
congress of vienna that drew the map of 19th century europe 
french foreign minister roland dumas bills the meeting as the 
most significant international event since 1945 
that year world war ii ended leaving europe devastated and 
millions dead iron curtain division soon added to the destruction 
splitting the continent in half 
for most of the next 40 years communist east and capitalist 
west locked in struggle to defend their ideals 
one of the few institutions that brought the soviet union 
united states canada and europe together was the conference on 
security and cooperation in europe or csce a loose grouping born 
with the signing of the 1975 helsinki human rights accord 
subsequent meetings in belgrade madrid and vienna strengthened 
the human rights commitments and security provisions of that act 
spurring demands for freedom in eastern europe 
it is fitting that it is the csce that will now seal the demise 
of the cold war and sketch the outlines of a new europe governed by 
trust in the rule of law and a free market 
on monday the leaders of nato and the six nations of the 
crumbling warsaw pact will sign a historic accord slashing arsenals 
of tanks helicopters and other conventional weapons 
new rules known as confidencebuilding measures will be adopted 
to ensure that europes armies know more about each other than ever 
before reducing or even eliminating the danger of surprise attack 
the two military alliances that armed europe to the teeth for 40 
years will also sign a formal nonaggression pact 
to underline the shift from armed suspicion to dialogue the 
leaders will put csce proceedings on a more permanent footing by 
agreeing that the heads of member states and governments meet 
at least once every two years their foreign ministers annually and 
senior officials even more often 
setting up a small secretariat in prague a center for the 
prevention of conflict in vienna and an office in warsaw to help 
monitor elections 
for diplomats like john maresca us ambassador to the 
negotiations on confidencebuilding measures in vienna this marks 
the end of a long road that began 18 years ago with the arduous 
negotiation of the 1975 helsinki final act 
by enshrining human rights in a document signed by the kremlin 
and its allies it provided western governments and soviet and east 
european dissidents with a legal right to fight for more freedom in 
the soviet bloc 
it contained the seeds of what happened last year with 
eastern europes revolutions maresca said 
no one expected such sharp sudden change he said but 
basically that was the objective 
now some of the former dissidents like czechoslovak president 
vaclav havel and polish premier tadeusz mazowiecki will be in 
paris to decide where csce should go from here in building a united 
continent linked to north america and the soviet union 
one idea outlined in the landmark declaration that ended natos 
london summit in july is for an assembly of europe a kind of csce 
parliament 
in three days of public speeches and a 90minute closeddoor 
session allowing freer discussion the leaders may decide to 
encourage their parliaments to set up this european assembly 
it is unlikely however that any such assembly or other 
possible measures such as an alliance to alleviate the easts 
energy woes will prove an instant panacea for europes remaining 
ills 
the csce adopts all decisions by consensus a mechanism maresca 
says serves to protect the essential interests of all members 
from the tiny vatican and luxembourg to the mighty superpowers 
that means painstaking negotiation to overcome any rift 
the united states and the european community who are supposed 
to issue a declaration of alliance at the paris summit are sharply 
divided over trade issues with the americans arguing the europeans 
must slash their massive farm subsidies 
nationalist tensions and economic woes compounded by the persian 
gulf crisis threaten the fragile democracies of eastern europe 
whose economies are still dependent on supplies from the 
increasingly fragmented soviet union 
some western countries most notably britain are still rent by 
internal discord over policy toward europe 
the role of dominant germany is also of concern hansdietrich 
genscher bonns foreign minister since 1974 was in the words of 
a bonn diplomat one of the spiritual fathers of the csce 
process 
aware that csce offered a chance for german unity genscher 
always gave the process the high profile it lacked for example in 
the united states 
in the days preceding the paris summit newly united germany 
firmly anchored in nato and the ec signed accords with moscow and 
poland that guaranteed its present borders but also underlined its 
pivotal role as the partner of east and west 
the paris speech of chancellor helmut kohl will be a test of how 
germany intends to wield its new might and live up to promises it 
will now shoulder more global responsibilities 
this special conference marks the final overcoming of the 
eastwest conflict kohls spokesman hans klein said it will 
introduce a new epoch in european history

researcher said in a report saturday 
rivers are so foul they cant be used for industrial cooling and

essential part of the regions economic recovery argues hilary 
french a senior researcher at the worldwatch institute 
given the degraded environments toll on human health and 
biological productivity decontaminating eastern europe and the 
soviet union is best seen as a precondition to economic 
development not an obstacle she writes 
the study green revolutions environmental reconstruction in 
eastern europe and the soviet union was published saturday by 
worldwatch a policy research organization based in washington 
despite the reports catalog of horrors it also voices optimism 
that significant improvement should be possible 
the emergence of a fairly strong environmental movement there 
is certainly a very hopeful sign ms french said in an 
interview and the problems are severe enough that it is widely 
recognized that theyll have to be dealt with 
she cites estimates by east european economists that poland is 
losing 10 percent to 20 percent of its gross national product each 
year to environmental degradation and czechoslovakia 5 percent to 7 
percent the health costs of pollution in those and other countries 
are also staggering if difficult to pin down 
investments in environmental protection are thus virtually 
guaranteed to provide economic benefits she writes 
the difficulty naturally will be finding money for the 
environmental investments when other problems also cry out for 
cash 
polands environment minister estimates that environmental 
projects could cost 20 billion over the next 10 to 20 years and 
czech officials believe they may have to spend 237 billion for 
pollution control over 15 years according to the worldwatch 
report 
ms french also cites an estimate of 249 billion to 308 
billion as the cost of bringing the environment of the former east 
germany up to western standards 
those numbers are imposing she acknowledged but that 
amount of spending has economic benefits of its own 
the cleanup should create jobs even as closing down hopelessly 
dirty and inefficient factories throws thousands of people out of 
work 
in addition the steps toward energy efficiency and waste 
reduction that will improve the environment are also essential to 
making the enterprises of what was the east bloc globally 
competitive 
eastern europe and the soviet union have a unique opportunity 
to cull from 20 years of western experience in addressing 
environmental problems ms french writes they could 
leapfrog the west in both policies and technologies 
in turn the east european cleanup could provide new insights on 
how to deal with wests worst pollution sites also health 
research in eastern europe is likely to provide more information 
about hardtostudy links between human illness and toxic 
substances in the air and water 
the reports that have come out are still not very scientific 
as far as associating effect with cause ms french said but 
you dont want to talk about east europe as a laboratory when 
there are human beings involved

south korea has retreated from some of the 
democratic reforms it pledged prior to the 1988 seoul olympic 
games the usbased human rights organization asia watch says 
despite promises south korea continues to deny the 
fundamental rights of workers labor organizations writers 
publishers opposition leaders and others asia watch said in a 
100page report released during the weekend 
the report titled retreat from reform focused on curbs 
against freedom of expression and worker rights it said about half 
of south koreas more than 1000 political prisoners are workers 
and labor organizers 
south korean workers desire for a larger share of the countrys 
new prosperity has become a source of major conflict with 
government and industry leaders concerned that higher wages will 
hurt competitiveness and economic growth 
asia watch also criticized president george bushs 
administration for pursuing south korean human rights issues 
through quiet diplomacy rather than publicly condemning abuses 
this approach undermined the stated us policy of encouraging 
democratization it said 
bush should have spoken out on human rights at his white house 
meeting with president roh taewoo last june asia watch said 
describing this as one of several lost opportunities 
retreat from reform described south koreas national 
security law as vaguelyworded and draconian it urged revision 
of the law to ease curbs on dissent and free expression with 
release of those detained for peaceful activity 
asia watch accused the roh government of a contradictory policy 
in promoting normalization and eventual unification with communist 
north korea while punishing private citizens for advocating 
unification or making contacts with the north this was described 
as an unacceptable limit on freedom of expression 
south korean labor laws and practices fell short of 
international labor organization standards of free bargaining and 
association the report said describing crackdowns on union 
activity in the hyundai industrial group the broadcasting and 
publishing industries and among public and private schoolteachers 
asia watch is affiliated with human rights watch helsinki watch 
and other organizations that monitor rights set forth in the 1975 
helsinki eastwest agreement 
the organization also released a statement from the south korean 
justice ministry branding retreat from reform as biased 
judgment 
the ministry said asia watch heeded only the onesided and 
superficial allegations by the lawbreakers who have perpetrated 
violent demonstrations and subversive activities inan attempt to 
overthrow the free and democratic system of the nation 
it said the government makes utmost efforts to ensure due 
process of law and criticized misguided tendencies among some 
to falsely eulogize lawbreakers as political prisoners or 
prisoners of conscience

three rival armies have raped 
looted and pillaged liberia for 11 months and there seems to be no 
end to the brutal civil war 
an estimated 10000 civilians have been killed and more than 
half the nations 23 million people are refugees 
soldiers sent by five other west african countries to stop the 
fighting are using both bombs and propaganda leaflets in an attempt 
to persuade rebel leader charles taylor to end the war he started 
it began dec 24 when taylor led his rebels into liberia from 
neighboring ivory coast to oust the government of president samuel 
doe who was accused of corruption human rights abuses and violent 
repression 
thousands of peasants including children as young as 8 joined 
taylor and overran most of the country 
a dissident faction that broke with taylors national patriotic 
front captured doe and tortured him to death in september then the 
8000member west african force moved in with tanks and planes 
drove taylors forces out of eastern monrovia and stopped fighting 
in the capital 
a nigerian newspaper the lagos guardian said today the west 
african force had surrounded the rebelheld port of buchanan and 
expected to take it within a week 
after the west africans reopened monrovias spriggs payne 
airfield to helicopters and light aircraft this month some members 
of an interim government were flown in taylor has his own 
administration in the interior and rejected the interim government 
chosen by exiled liberians 
amos sawyer a veteran leftist opposition leader who is 
president of the interim government was shuttling among west 
african capitals last week in pursuit of a ceasefire 
the other warring parties the liberian army and rebels led by 
prince johnson have said they welcome the interim government and 
its mandate to organize fair elections 
interim government spokesman edward dunn said however that 
johnson sent a letter threatening some of the ministers dunn the 
government protocol officer said johnson warned some to stay away 
from monrovia including baccus matthews the interim foreign 
minister and gbai bala a former adviser to doe 
hundreds of liberians have gathered on the docks of freetown 
sierra leone hoping to follow the interim government home 
apparently preferring the hardships of monrovia to refugee camps 
where food also is scarce 
president joseph momoh of sierra leone has said his government 
would not accept any more liberian refugees unless more 
international aid was provided to take care of them 
two weeks ago momoh rejected a request sent through the us 
embassy that 160 children orphaned by the war be allowed into 
sierra leone he also said the united states was not doing enough 
to help refugees despite its historic ties with liberia 
freed american salves founded liberia in 1847 they subjugated 
the natives and their descendants dominated the country until 1980 
when doe seized power in a coup 
africa watch an american human rights group said in a report 
oct 26 because past us support for doe played a major role in 
the destruction of the country today the bush administration has 
an important responsibility to do more to assist the victims of the 
conflict 
all parties to the conflict have committed grave abuses of 
human rights against civilians it said and criticized the west 
african army for bombing raids that according to survivors have 
killed hundreds of civilians 
the report criticized the multinational army for accepting into 
its ranks members of the doe army and johnson forces who agreed to 
a ceasefire in the civil war 
european relief workers reported this month that food 
distribution had to be suspended temporarily in monrovia where 
hundreds of people have died of starvation because army soldiers 
were stealing food from civilians 
since then the west africans have tried to talk the soldiers 
back into their barracks and the nearby presidential mansion where 
they had been trapped by johnsons forces 
some rebels continue to desert west african leaflets dropped 
from planes urge them to give up this useless war taylors 
radio station has broadcast orders that no fighters leave the front 
without written permission 
the ivory coast already sheltering thousands of gio and mano 
tribespeople who were the targets of does soldiers also has 
become a refuge for civilians of does krahn tribe 
in its report africa watch said krahns were fleeing grand gedeh 
county a krahn stronghold on the ivory coast border at a rate of 
1000 a day 
those who cross the border tell horror stories 
i saw them kill a mother and her 3yearold twins and two 
others a refugee teacher said my two brothers are missing 
and three other members of my family i dont know where they are 
because we fled in all directions when the rebels attacked so many 
people died that you dont have enough paper to write down all 
their names

a top iraqi general said saturday that 
usled military forces would face uncalculated developments 
that would thwart any attack they launched to dislodge iraq from 
kuwait 
the warning came from maj gen mundhir abdulrahman a missile 
expert and head of the iraqi armys morale and guidance department 
but it was difficult to determine whether the general was 
speaking in his capacity as a specialist in longrange weaponry 
or as chief military morale booster 
writing in alqadissiya the armys daily newspaper 
abdulrahman questioned the value of western air superiority if the 
aim was to take iraqi territory 
he said his country was prepared to defend itself despite plans 
to increase us troop strength us officials announced earlier 
this month that another 200000 us troops would join the 230000 
americans already deployed in the region 
britains independent newspaper reported saturday that iraq is 
believed to have assembled three socalled superguns able to 
fire shells a distance of more than 450 miles 
us intelligence sources believe the guns largely assembled 
from britishmade components may have been delivered to iraq 
before production of these exotic weapons was discovered earlier 
this year 
in his article abdulrahman wrote the surprise element by 
iraq will make the american aggression face uncalculated 
developments and unexpected results in iraqs reaction which 
would make their execution of aggression according to its plans 
impossible 
iraq could come up with a military surprise that would not allow 
usled forces to manage the crisis the way they like 
abdulrahman said 
the latest announced increase in american troop strength will 
raise the us forces in the region to 430000 soldiers marines 
airmen and sailors believed to be about equivalent to the number 
of iraqi forces in kuwait and their strategic reserve in southern 
iraq 
president bush said the extra forces were was needed in case it 
became necessary to launch a military strike to dislodge iraq from 
kuwait iraq overran the emirate on aug 2 
abdulrahman questioned the idea of a surgical air strike by the 
usled forces military experts say western air power is 
technologically superior to iraqs air strength of around 500plus 
comat jets 
the combined air power of the united states britain france and 
their allies in the gulf region now totals more than 1000 fighters 
and attack aircraft 
never in the past was the air force able to end war 
abdulrahman stressed a point on which many western analysts 
agree 
abdulrahman said the balance in ground forces was in iraqs 
favor with numerical superiority wartested experience and 
support weaponry 
when the american administration launches its aggression 
whether now or in the near future it will go into a war with a 
position which has been made late and wrong in its strategic 
calculations 
it will not be useful to send more troops to join the military 
buildup in the area to reverse that position the general said 
iraqi officials have said that the underlying reason for the 
western presence in the region was to try to knock president saddam 
hussein from power 
they said the western powers fear iraq is becoming a military 
counterweight to israel in the middle east and that they want to 
dominate the regions oil resources 
before leaving washington friday on a tour that will take him to 
europe and the middle east bush said there is a ticking of the 
clock on the gulf crisis 
alqadissiya was not the only iraqi newspaper to advise the 
antiiraq alliance against military action 
the official iraqi news agency monitored in nicosia reported 
the governmentrun daily aljumhuriya warned bush and british 
prime minister margaret thatcher to stop using direct and 
indirect threats assuring that iraq possesses a lot of 
surprises 
if there are such surprises in store us officials seem bent 
on uncovering them astronauts on a secret space shuttle mission on 
friday deployed a surveillance satellite according to sources at 
the us space center at cape canaveral fla 
published reports have said the spacecraft will either eavesdrop 
on communications in the gulf or conduct photo surveys of iraq and 
kuwait the satellite would be the latest in a fleet 
at least 12 other reconnaisance electronic surveillance 
earlywarning meteorlogical and navigation satellites already 
relay data 24 hours a day they include systems that can spot tank 
tracks in the desert and others that can give b52 bombers greater 
accuracy

wheres the beef the wolf burger 
makes its desert debut sunday bringing a tasty morsel of americana 
to frontline troops who are fed up with prepackaged army chow 
it may not come from the golden arches or be a whopper oozing 
with onions and catsup but its free 
and so are the french fries sodas hot dogs and grilled cheese 
sandwiches that will be cooked on the us militarys version of a 
traveling fastfood stand the wolfmobile 
it was the brainchild of chief warrant officer wes wolf 42 of 
monterey calif who dreamed up the idea in the middle of 
organizing thanksgiving dinner for most of the 230000 americans in 
operation desert shield 
maj gen william gus pagonis the us armys logistics 
chief gave wolfs name to the foodmobile the militarys treat 
for the gi fastfood junkie stranded in the sand dunes and 
surviving on cold rations hot tvstyle dinners and an occasional 
hot cooked meal 
we have a generation of soldiers including myself that grew up 
on hamburgers and french fries and so were going to provide 
that pagonis said out in the desert youre going to see 
these wolfmobiles 
the first wolfmobile left friday for the 1st cavalry division 
camped in the desert in eastern saudi arabia and the two army cooks 
manning it will start grilling wolfburgers and hot dogs on sunday 
wolf said 80 wolfmobile trucks were being dispatched to the 
desert where they would move among the frontline units 
even if the wolfmobiles cant get to every forward unit pagonis 
said at least when the soldiers come back to their base camp 
they can get french fries and a hamburger 
much of the griping from americans deployed here following the 
iraqi invasion of kuwait on aug 2 has focused on food and the 
complaints have been loudest from frontline units forced to eat 
more prepackaged combat rations 
gen pagonis insists that the soldiers in the desert receive 
the same quality food that were giving to the soldiers back here 
in the rear wolf said he doesnt care what is forward as far 
as equipment and hes very very concerned about that 
shortorder food is more popular than regular hot meals at army 
bases in the states so wolf and pagonis first decided to open a 
fastfood dining facility 
its called the pentagon and is open nightly serving pizza hot 
dogs hamburgers and chili but its only available to soldiers in 
rearline units 
then it was time to take care of the soldiers in the desert 
thats when we came up with the idea of a mobiletype truck 
wolf said we thought well theres no reason that we cant 
put a couple of military cooks in there get the supplies from the 
saudi government then the soldiers can just walk up and order a 
hamburger fries and a soda and just walk away without paying for 
it 
saudi arabia is supplying all food for the us forces here 
under an agreement with the united states 
the wolfmobile is a 30footlong twoton truck with a foldout 
window and a ramp to walk up and order food its equipped with a 
franklin stove grills a deepfat fryer freezer refrigerator a 
grilledcheese maker and eight heat lamps to keep the food warm 
each truck can feed between 500 and 800 soldiers before it needs 
to be resupplied 
even though wolf isnt planning to retire from the army yet the 
rangy soldier likes the idea of franchising wolf burgers some day 
and hes already got the slogan a burger on every bayonet

iraq is grappling with a deadly serious 
shortage of drugs and other medical supplies as the result of un 
sanctions against the baghdad government the health minister said 
saturday 
minister abdulsalam mohammed saeed also said the country is 
also running out of milk for babies and complained that many 
countries had refused to send supplies ordered before the embargo 
was imposed 
the sanctions were approved as part of an international effort 
to force iraq out of kuwait after its aug 2 invasion but they 
exempt supplies intended strictly for medical purposes 
saeed accused turkey iraqs northern neighbor of preventing 
large quantities of medicine and milk from reaching iraq he 
provided no details 
it is deadly serious and as the minister of health i think 
it is not only inhumane but also criminal to deprive my people from 
medicine and other medical supplies saeed said at a baghdad 
news conference 
he said iraqis have been most affected by shortages of medicines 
with short shelf lives plus vaccines and milk for infants he 
cited a severe shortage of antibiotics and medicine for people with 
heart problems and diabetes 
the minister said some newborns receive only 3 pounds of food a 
month compared with a minimum standard of 10 pounds he said he 
feared some were already suffering ill effects 
im really worried about our children they might not be able 
to receive a sufficient amount of nutrition he said 
he said polio posed a threat to childrens health because of the 
lack of vaccines 
the health minister was also critical of the chairman of the 
un committee that supervises that embargo for reporting that iraq 
had medical supplies that could last 10 years 
the chairman marjatta rasi of finland should be better 
informed about the needs of newborn children but im afraid that 
her statement was not only childish but irresponsible saeed 
said 
rasi said earlier this month she feared that iraq could make 
biological or chemical weapons from components of some medicines 
that had been supplied under embargo exemptions iraq denied that 
she said some experts believed certain medical supplies could 
last 10 years iraq produces some of its own antibiotics 
painkillers and other simple drugs 
but the health minister said our industry is a really small 
one 
painkillers cold medicine and other such drugs have been scarce 
in baghdad pharmacies since the first days of the embargo when 
some people began hoarding 
the government has been encouraging research of herbal 
medicines as well as their practical use by health professionals

yevgeny and julia loukyanov late of 
moscow spend their days looking in shop windows at things they 
cant afford or sitting in a crowded refugee center wondering what 
the future holds 
we cant work because we cant get work papers said julia 
25 but the worst thing is after all this well probably be 
kicked out of the country 
the young russian couple are part of europes greatest refugee 
migration since world war ii it became a tide sweeping from east 
to west after the communist regimes of the soviet bloc collapsed a 
year ago 
when the first thousands came seeking better lives in a more 
secure future citizens of the western democracies cheered 
embraced them and offered gifts 
but they came in millions had to be housed and fed and took 
jobs westerners felt were rightfully theirs welcome began turning 
to resentment west germany committed billions of dollars of public 
money to the economic derelict that was east germany for 40 years 
until reunification 
a combination of the westward flow of europeans and a huge 
migration from third world countries has increased racial and 
ethnic tensions created severe housing shortages and caused social 
welfare costs to balloon 
now the soviet union may be on the point of disintegration 
which could add 15 million more refugees to the flood 
the soviets themselves have been mentioning anything from 2 
million to 15 million said jonas widgren an asylum consultant 
at the office of the un high commissioner for refugees in geneva 
economic conditions are getting worse in the eastern european 
countries which means the number of people heading west is likely 
to grow 
the year 1991 will be the worst year economically for 
eastern europe since world war ii said heinrich machowski an 
expert on east bloc affairs at the german institute for economic 
research in berlin 
nearly 2 million people have sought asylum in 10 western 
european nations since 1983 and millions more have immigrated 
illegally 
according to un statistics the number seeking asylum in the 
10 countries soared from 61100 in 1983 to 300500 last year 
nearly 400000 more are expected by the end of this year plus 
about 1 million ethnic germans who have automatic german 
citizenship 
in addition to east europeans the newcomers include refugees 
from such countries as lebanon iran sudan tunisia algeria 
bangladesh and sri lanka 
i left sudan because i was put in prison for my political 
views said ahmed alseed gasm 27 another refugee at the bonn 
shelter i need that residence permit because i cant go back 
home 
west european nations are tightening immigration laws and 
cracking down on illegal immigrants but that has not stemmed the 
flow 
public resentment is turning to violence 
in florence italy earlier this year masked youths assaulted 
african street vendors with baseball bats 
rockthrowing german youths have attacked tent cities set up by 
romanian gypsies 
some parents in a german town refused to send their children to 
a school whose gymnasium had been a temporary shelter for gypsies 
they expressed fear their children would catch diseases or be 
infested with lice 
gypsies fleeing ethnic troubles in their home countries are seen 
on german streets in growing numbers several hundred camped out in 
trailers at berlins brandenburg gate until police ordered them to 
leave 
gangs of young german skinheads frequently attack turks 
vietnamese and other foreigners 
in paris african immigrants were the targets of an 
antisquatter eviction campaign for weeks afterward several dozen 
former squatters lived in makeshift tents at a corner of sacre 
coeur basilica 
austria which was the neutral bridge between east and west for 
decades sent soldiers to stop romanian refugees ariving via 
hungry the freedom party nearly doubled its parliamentary seats in 
this falls elections partially on the strengths of its 
antiimmigration stands 
germanys wealth proximity to the former east bloc and history 
of generosity to refugees has made it a prime destination 
it expects asylumseekers to total nearly 200000 this year 
plus the ethnic germans from former soviet bloc countries 
officials said friday they will assign 20 percent of all 
asylumseekers to the formerly communist east starting in december 
refugee centers are overflowing army barracks empty warehouses 
and rented boats on the rhine are used as emergency shelters 
yevgeny and julia loukyanov left moscow in october fleeing a 
nation they feel is about to come apart 
social welfare is paying their expenses at the bonn refugee 
shelter until a decision is made on their application for asylum 
officials indicate they have little chance of acceptance because 
the end of the cold war removed most reasons for granting asylum to 
soviet citizens

are the keating five senators victims of a 
flawed system or cynical cashgrabbers who championed the dubious 
cause of one jetset constituent at the expense of everyone else in 
the country 
what is being examined in their senate ethics hearing the way 
the entire institution operates or the conduct of five members 
and how did a senate leader two national heroes a former 
prosecutor and a man who arrived 23 years ago as a reformer come to 
this pass 
it would be hard for it not to be a landmark case associate 
senate historian donald ritchie said of the tale unfolding before 
the senate ethics committee whatever comes out will affect the 
way business is done theyll all have to look at themselves it 
will be an important precedent for how to judge the behavior of 
other people in the future 
there are long days of witnesses and crossexamination to come 
including an opening statement from arizona democratic sen dennis 
deconcini who did not have time to speak friday but robert 
bennett the ethics committees blunt special counsel already has 
presented his star witness four tall stacks of paper 
paper he said is the only reliable source of information on 
the web of contributions and favors linking the five senators to 
charles h keating jr and his zealous attempts to thwart the 
federal regulators closing in on his failing lincoln savings and 
loan association 
paper doesnt suffer from human emotion or frailties nor does 
it change with time bennett said paper doesnt have faulty 
recollections its highly credible this paper 
bennett said the tens of thousands of documents his staff had 
examined showed no evidence of misconduct by sens john glenn 
dohio and john mccain rariz the first a former astronaut 
the second a former vietnam prisoner of war 
but he also implied that democratic sen don riegle the 
michigan veteran and onetime rebel who now chairs the senate 
banking committee was not being straightforward about his role 
and he suggested that deconcini a former prosecutor and senate 
democratic whip alan cranston of california crossed an ethical line 
in their dealings with keating 
glenn mccain riegle and cranston denied any wrongdoing before 
the committee friday and deconcini is expected to do the same this 
week 
much of the future testimony will center on the existence and 
location of that line under a system in which names on the 
contribution list inevitably turn up among those requesting help 
sen warren rudman rnh a member of the ethics panel has 
already argued that the committee cannot act on the basis of 
laws rules and standards that some people might like to see 
the committee must use the standards that are in place 
but bennett and some on the panel said former illinois sen paul 
douglas had developed guiding principles that are now well 
established make sure a constituents cause has merit douglas 
wrote in a book on the subject allow a decent interval of time 
between a contribution and a favor and dont try to bully or 
intimidate officials 
ritchie agrees that there is an ethical line but he says it 
keeps moving and is easy to cross unwittingly 
much of what people consider unethical today was ethical in 
the past the historian said daniel webster argued cases 
before the supreme court for a fee while he was a senator senators 
used to take retainers from large corporations in the late 
19th century it was considered legitimate for washington newspaper 
correspondents to serve as clerks of committees of congress while 
writing for the paper 
the keating case concerns a timeless issue influence peddling 
but ritchie said its scope involving five senators is 
unprecedented 
the only comparable case occurred more than 100 years ago he 
said when two house committees and one in the senate uncovered a 
bribery scheme meant to head off a congressional investigation of 
railroad transportation rates 
rep oakes ames was accused of using undervalued railroad stock 
to bribe the vice president two senators and three house members 
including the speaker and rep james garfield who never cleared up 
his connection but later became president 
when asked how he had decided who would get the stock ames 
replied that he gave it where it would do the best ritchie 
said 
the keating case has taken on even broader significance in view 
of the collapse of the sampl industry which could cost us 
taxpayers up to 500 billion part of that is the 2 billion 
lincoln failure for which keating now faces criminal and civil 
charges 
ritchie compared the keating hearings to a congressional 
investigation into the 1929 wall street crash he said that inquiry 
laid bare the banking industrys abuses and gave the public some 
sense of who was responsible for the crash 
if keating were the only banker in the country who had 
problems it would be different but hes symbolic of a much larger 
problem ritchie said 
bennett made clear he does not believe the keating five 
should be blamed for the sampl mess but he did say it would be fair 
to ask if they had thought carefully about what would happen if 
keating got what he wanted 
the senators had other constituents he said among them the 
depositors who lost their savings and the us taxpayers who will 
foot the lincoln bailout bill who was listening to their 
concerns when the meetings and phone calls to regulators were 
occurring he asked 
bennett was billed as a factfinder but often sounded so 
prosecutorial that he brought protests from senators both on and 
off the ethics committee you asked me to call it the way it 
was he said at one point and im going to do that 
there were those who liked his calls and those who didnt 
mccain emerged from day one letting out a long loud breath of 
relief and glenn lauded bennett for doing a fine job cranston 
snubbed the whole affair watching it on tv in his office until it 
was his turn to speak friday riegle shook with anger and tension 
during comments to reporters and deconcini fought to restrain 
himself 
i dont think anybody would contend that this is a fair 
process deconcini said tersely i didnt create this world i 
just happen to live in it

following is the transcript of an 
address delivered by president bush on saturday at wenceslas 
square 
thank you mr president and thank you my czech and slovak 
friends 
it is a tremendous honor to me to be the first sitting american 
president to visit this proud and beautiful country and to be able 
to join you on the first anniversary of the extraordinary velvet 
revolution what a powerfully moving sight it is 
there are no leaves on the trees but it is prague spring 
there are no flowers in bloom and yet it is prague spring the 
calendar says november 17 and yet it is prague spring 
your declaration of independence claims the forces of darkness 
have served the victory of light the longedfor age of humanity is 
dawning today the freedomloving people of the world can bear 
witness that this age of humanity has now finally and truly dawned 
on this splendid nation 
seven decades ago an unprecedented partnership began between 
two presidents the philosopher tomas masaryk and the idealistic 
scholar woodrow wilson it was a partnership as well among czechs 
and slovaks to join together in federation and yes it was a long 
hard road from their work on your declaration of independence to 
this magnificent celebration today 
i am proud to walk these last steps with you as one shared 
journey ends and another begins 
our countries share a history we share a vision and we share a 
friendship a friendship masaryk described to czechamerican 
soldiers 70 years ago he said do not forget that the same 
ideals the same principles ever unite us do not forget us as we 
shall never forget you and that is why im here today we have 
not forgotten and the world will never forget what happened here 
in this square where the history of freedom was written the days 
of anguish the days of hope so many times you came here bearing 
candles against the dark night answering the call of comenius to 
follow the way of light these brave flames came to symbolize your 
fiercely burning national pride 
a year ago the world saw you face down totalitarianism we saw 
the peaceful crowd swell day by day in numbers and in resolve and 
we saw the few candles grow into a blaze and we saw the square 
become a beacon of hope for an entire nation as it gave birth to 
your new era of freedom 
this victory owes its heart to two great heroes alexander 
dubcek 22 years ago he led this nation in its first sweet taste 
of liberty his are the will and compassion that are the living 
czechoslovakia and then president havel a man of wisdom a man of 
tremendous moral courage 
in the dark years on one side sat the state on the other side 
havel one side tyranny on the other this man of vision and truth 
among the first was havel and now there are millions today a 
europe whole and free is within our reach weve seen a new world 
of freedom born amidst shouts of joy born full of hope barreling 
with confidence toward a new century a new world born of a 
revolution that linked this square with others gdansk budapest 
berlin a revolution that joined together people fueled by courage 
and by humanitys essential quest for freedom 
and for four decades our two nations waited across the divide 
between east and west two peoples united in spirit and vision and 
yet separated by conflict today the united states and 
czechoslovakia stand together united once more in our devotion to 
the democratic ideal and now with the division of europe ending 
and democracy ascending in the east the challenge is to move 
forward 
in czechoslovakia from revolution to renaissance across this 
continent toward a new europe in which each nation and every 
culture can flourish and breathe free on both sides of the 
atlantic toward a commonwealth of freedom based on our shared 
principles and our hopes for the whole world a commonwealth 
inspired by the words of your great comenius written three 
centuries ago let us have but one end in view the welfare of 
humanity 
a thousand miles to the south this new commonwealth of freedom 
now faces a terrible test czechoslovakia was one of the first 
nations to condemn the outrage in the persian gulf one of the 
first to measure the magnitude of the wrong committed in the name 
of territorial ambition 
it is no coincidence that appeasements lonely victim half a 
century ago should be among the first to understand that there is 
right and there is wrong there is good and there is evil and 
there are sacrifices worth making 
there is no question about what binds our nations and so many 
others in common cause there is no question that ours is a just 
cause and that good will that good will prevail that darkness is 
the in the desert sky cannot stand against the way of light 
i salute your courageous president when he joins us in saying 
that saddam husseins aggression must not be rewarded 
earlier today i told your parliament we know this is a 
difficult time for you but also a time of extraordinary 
optimism 
as you undertake political and economic reform know one thing 
america will not fail you in this decisive moment america will 
stand with you we will continue along the road mapped out by our 
presidents more than 70 years ago a road whose goal was described 
by woodrow wilson to bring peace and safety to all nations and 
make the world itself at last free for the past 70 years your 
declaration of independence has been preserved and cherished in our 
library of congress i say it is time for masaryks words to come 
home and as humanity and liberty return to czechoslovakia so too 
will this treasured document 
on behalf of the people of the united states i am proud to be 
able to tell the people of czechoslovakia 1989 was the year that 
freedom came home to czechoslovakia 1990 will be the year your 
declaration of independence came home to the golden city of prague 
may it be for future generations a reminder of the ties that bind 
our nations and the principles that bind all humanity 
in 1776 when our declaration of independence was first read in 
public a bell tolled to proclaim the defiant thrill of that 
moment 
that bell we call it at home the liberty bell has for 200 
years symbolized out nations deepest dedication to freedom 
dedication like your own inscribed on this bell are the words 
proclaim liberty throughout all the land we want to help you 
proclaim your new liberty throughout all this proud and beautiful 
land and so today we give to you our last replica of the liberty 
bell 
you know one of our patriotic songs proclaims sweet land of 
liberty from every mountainside let freedom ring and so when 
bells ring in wenceslas square or in bratislava or anywhere in this 
glorious country think of this bell and know that all bells are 
tolling for your precious liberty now and forever 
and so now i am proud to ring this bell three times once for 
your courage once for your freedom and once for your children 
may god bless czechoslovakia thank you very much

here is the text of soviet president mikhail s 
gorbachevs speech to the supreme soviet today as translated by 
the associated press 
comrades addresses made at yesterdays session of peoples 
deputies by members of the supreme soviet representatives of 
republics my talks with other comrades during the session show 
that a general opinion has formed that the union treaty should be 
moved ahead faster 
but even before that strong radical measures are needed to 
improve the situation in the country as far as the political and 
economic stability is concerned as well as public law and order 
discipline and normalization of interethnic relations it is my 
understanding that the comrades think that an urgent reform and 
strengthening of the state power structure is the major priority 
in this connection i propose the following 
first to vest qualitatively new powers into the federation 
council it should be transformed from an advisory body into an 
effective structure to coordinate the efforts of the center and the 
republics i will emphasize this anything affecting the entire 
country whether decided by the center or republics must be 
discussed and given the goahead by the federation council a 
mutually acceptable basis for a decision is to be worked out there 
its work must be done on a regular basis be open to the society 
the interrepublican committee can become the working organ of the 
federation council highly qualified experts and specialists with 
powers to represent republics would work in it on a permanent 
basis 
second in this case to dissolve the presidential council and 
establish a national security council to launch without delay a 
radical reorganization of the central executive branch of power 
subordinate it to the president and introduce changes of the 
structure and personnel remove outdated structures form new ones 
i will not name them all but i have mentioned most of them new 
people of initiative capable of innovative thinking should be 
brought into the cabinet the issue of a vicepresidency obviously 
needs to be resolved concurrent decisions have to be made to 
ensure efficient operation of governments at local level all this 
must be done without delay without waiting for a union treaty as 
i have been urging all along but i understand that you have 
brought here all concerns all the feelings of the society taking 
all this into account we must act and solve everything in the 
supreme soviet as the situation demands even before the congress 
of peoples deputies convenes 
third justified demands are being voiced to consolidate law and 
order guarantee the safety of each citizen of our country urgent 
changes of structure and personnel both in the center republics 
and at local level are called for and something else we must do 
our best to prevent global and general intervention into the 
activities of law enforcement organs that is practically paralyzing 
now their operation there are laws adopted here by ourselves and 
if we have any selfrespect we ought to allow them to work 
applause i propose to form within the framework of presidential 
power an organ to coordinate the activities of law enforcement 
agencies to combat organized crime shadow economy profiteering 
and other manifestations of criminal activities that are sweeping 
the country what i have in mind is a special service reporting to 
the president we would invite energetic and highly skilled 
professionals this question has been worked out and the new organ 
can start work in 10 to 12 days a chamber of control must be 
established for the president with authorized representatives in 
all regions to ensure implementation of laws decisions and 
directives 
fourth on food i will repeat that resources are not less than 
last year it is basically a matter of regularizing the system of 
supplying the population with products they need of how accurate 
regions and republic are in meeting their obligations besides we 
need to take stock of what we have and control it well i have 
issued a directive that a list of urgent measures for supplying 
this years produce to the population be worked out urgently and 
submitted in the next 10 days two weeks at the most for 
consideration or at least for your information 
fifth specifically on measures to ensure the viability of the 
country here i give priority to railway transport and power 
industry i am appealing to all soviets executive and government 
organs to do all possible to ensure uninterrupted work of these 
important industries not to allow any disruptions in moving 
freight or any time lost unnecessarily to load and unload railway 
cars all operational measures to achieve it and we have a lot of 
experience will be justified

he performed in places like madison square 
garden more times than frank sinatra jack dempsey and lots of 
other big names 
but after 11697 shows animal trainer gunther gebelwilliams 
performs his last deathdefying act sunday with the ringling bros 
and barnum amp bailey circus 
everybody asks me why now he said in the thick german 
accent he hasnt lost since he came to the united states 22 years 
ago i want to step down when i am really good i dont want to 
be like ali sugar ray another fight another fight 
a us citizen since 1979 he calls himself germanengineered 
but a proud american and often sports a cowboy hat and a 
westernstyle shirt though hes 56 gebelwilliams remains 
enviably trim 141 pounds with a ruddy complexion and his trademark 
sweep of blond hair 
he announced two years ago that he would retire from the 
greatest show on earth at the end of the 1990 season he plans to 
settle at his winter home in venice fla with his 20 bengal and 
siberian tigers 
after 42 years on the road he said training 20 tigers is 
getting a little riskier because he has lost some of his quickness 
and his eyesight is not what it used to be 
and glasses wouldnt look so hot with his skinhugging tights 
and sequined boleros he joked 
when you have 20 tigers its not easy to act like nothing can 
happen he said ive been like their father their brother 
ive been in charge always but when one tiger is hurt they always 
blame me 
his domination in the ring comes from a softspoken training 
method based on mutual respect that separates him from his 
chairand whipwielding predecessors like clyde beatty and mabel 
stark who taught animals to fear them 
gebelwilliams strokes his elephants trunks pats the tigers 
and mumbles commands in german indian or english he welcomes 
animal rights advocates to attend his training sessions 
thats the difference between me and everybody else he 
said i did everything with open doors 
in 21 years never did somebody say i treated an animal 
wrong 
gebelwilliams began his career when he joined circus williams 
in germany as an usher at 12 he became so much a part of the 
williams family who had hired his mother as a seamstress that he 
added their name to his by the 1960s he was wellknown as one of 
europes top animal trainers 
in 1968 he caught the eye of irvin feld owner and producer of 
ringling bros and barnum amp bailey circus who bought the entire 
circus williams to get their star to come to america 
now gebelwilliams will yield the ring to his 20yearold son 
mark but he wont yield the tigers because hes afraid they wont 
transfer their devotion to his son 
marks act will include the african and indian elephants white 
lippizaner horses zebras and camels 
i think its time for mark i have to step back said 
gebelwilliams adding that hell continue to work with the animals 
behind the scenes 
gebelwilliams said he didnt plan anything special for his last 
show explaining that a change in routine would confuse the 
animals and he hopes no one calls for a speech 
itll be very tough but as long as i dont have to talk i can 
get through it he said 
after a lifetime with the circus it would be impossible for him 
and his tigers to give it up entirely he said 
i believe some of my tigers will miss this maybe once in a 
while ill take them in the ring in venice turn on the music real 
loud and let them pretend

manuel noriega got his day in court accusing the 
us government of railroading him by freezing his assets and 
forcing out his attorneys a federal judge assured him he will get 
a fair trial 
meanwhile at a press conference in atlanta cable news network 
on friday denied a reporters box full of tapes and other items on 
the noriega case was made available to the fbi 
but cnn could not clearly explain a sister companys alleged 
role in getting the box to federal agents thursday 
speaking extensively to us district judge william hoeveler for 
the first time since he surrendered in january to us invasion 
troops noriega tried friday to stop him from replacing private 
defense attorneys with governmentpaid lawyers 
i am now at the mercy of a totally unfair and unjust system 
that chooses my prosecutors and now chooses my defense lawyers 
the deposed panamanian dictator said reading quietly but 
forcefully in spanish from a prepared statement 
led by frank rubino noriegas lawyers say they can no longer 
work unless the panamanians assets are unfrozen to pay them or 
the judge raises the 75anhour fee cap on courtappointment 
lawyers 
hoeveler said he would rule in the near future but reminded the 
attorneys that raising the caps for the noriega case was rejected 
previously 
he also said he received communications from some exceedingly 
fine criminal defense lawyers willing to take the case under the 
low government fee schedule 
i want the defendant to understand he is not being cast adrift 
by the court and by the judicial system hoeveler said 
earlier friday the private defense team filed a broad motion 
asking dismissal of all drug charges against their client it 
argued that freezing noriegas assets and taping his prison phone 
calls was government misconduct 
hoeveler did not immediately rule on the dismissal motion 
in the cnn matter the network claims the fbi contacted turner 
security a subsidiary of turner broadcasting inc which also 
operates cnn the network says agents told turner security they 
were searching for a box fitting the description of one hotel 
security officers removed earlier in the week from the room of a 
reporter assigned to the noriega case 
the fbi maintained that agents learned of the box from turner 
security joe shirley head of turner security did not return 
repeated phone calls friday 
william hinshaw agent in charge of the atlanta fbi office said 
shirley called an agent investigating how cnn got the noriega tapes 
and told the agent that a box labeled noriega tapes had been 
removed from a hotel room the agent hinshaw said earlier had 
contacted turner security about interviewing a cnn employee 
i think when shirley called he was just trying to 
fulfill his responsibility hinshaw said 
cnn general counsel steven korn insisted the fbi not turner 
security made the first phone call about the box when asked 
whether cnn made the box available to the fbi korn replied 
emphatically no 
asked why turner security didnt give the box to cnn korn said 
thats a good question 
cnn has asked the us supreme court to overturn hoevelers 
order issued last week barring it from broadcasting recordings of 
prison telephone conversations between noriega and his defense 
team 
cnn president tom johnson said friday he didnt know if the 
recordings contained in the box were audio or video tapes or if 
they contained phone calls between noriega and his legal team 
noriega is being held at the metropolitan correctional center 
outside miami on charges of accepting 46 million in bribes to 
turn panama into a way station for colombias medellin cocaine 
cartel

bid to avoid a walkout at the san francisco bay areas three 
largest newspapers 
unions representing about 4500 employees at the san francisco 
chronicle san francisco examiner and san jose mercury news had 
threatened to strike at 5 pm friday if an agreement on a new

work week while management suggested a wage freeze over the next 
three years with 80 lump sum payments made to each employee every 
six months

in stopping the clock to allow negotiations to continue said 
union spokeswoman dawn garcia 
im confident we will reach an agreement if we stay at it

newspaper agency which runs chronicle and examiner business 
operations

million topscale pay at each is 801 a week for reporters 669 
for clerical and library workers and 675 for delivery truck

secretary of state james a baker iii picked up 
the vote of at least one african nation saturday in his drive to 
line up support for a resolution endorsing the use of military 
force to get iraq out of kuwait 
zaires foreign minister kalimba wakatana mushobekwa said his 
government would go along with a resolution in the un security 
council authorizing force if peaceful means failed 
yes we support it he said in response to reporters 
questions 
but he also expressed the hope that a peaceful way would be 
found to resolve the persian gulf crisis 
baker was upbeat after his talks with mushobekwa and the foreign 
ministers of ethiopia and the ivory coast all nonaligned nations 
who are currently on the 15member security council 
i think weve had a positive day consulting with other members 
of the council baker said after his hourlong meeting with 
mushobekwa 
i dont want to get into the business of counting votes here 
or predicting results or anything like that but weve had some 
good meetings today he said 
the united states would like broad support for its moves on the 
gulf crisis by gaining approval from neutral and third world 
countries 
after the sessions baker was flying to paris where he was to 
meet on sunday with five more nations on the security council the 
soviet union france britain finland and romania 
baker who flew saturday morning to geneva from brussels 
belgium opened his latest round of talks with ethiopian foreign 
minister tesfaye dinka 
dinka described the discussions as very interesting and 
replied yes of course when asked whether they were 
successful 
simeon ake foreign minister of the ivory coast said he wasnt 
used to revealing private conversations to reporters and hurried 
off to his waiting car 
the talks were held at the us mission to the united nations 
not far from lake geneva 
at the united nations diplomats said baker wanted foreign 
ministers to travel to new york to adopt personally the resolution 
on use of force foreign ministers rarely sit in their countrys 
seats on the security council except in particularly serious 
situations 
baker has insisted that the bush administration has made no 
final decision on whether to offer the resolution for a vote i 
havent seen a draft resolution yet he said saturday 
but officials seem ready to go ahead and introduce the document 
in the security council before the end of the month the united 
states holds the rotating presidency of the council in november 
yemen an arab nation which has been sympathetic to iraq assumes 
the chairmanship in december 
the united nations has approved 10 resolutions directed against 
iraq since its aug 2 invasion of tiny kuwait 
on a trip last week to the gulf baker made initial contacts 
with the soviet union china britain and france to get their 
backing for the useofforce resolution as permanent members of 
the security council they could kill it with a veto 
france china and the soviet union have indicated they would 
like more time to give economic sanctions and diplomacy a chance to 
force iraqi president saddam hussein to pull his troops out of 
kuwait 
on sunday baker will meet with soviet foreign minister eduard 
shevardnadze and may ask about a suggestion by a soviet envoy that 
a flexible linkage be drawn between an iraqi pullout and a

atlantis five astronauts orbited 
170 miles above the world amid military secrecy saturday after 
accomplishing their major objective delivering a spy satellite 
into space 
the crew deployed the spacecraft from the shuttle friday 
sources said the satellite reportedly is to spy on iraq by 
eavesdropping on communications or conducting photo surveys 
nasa refused to discuss the defense department flight and 
mission control issued only terse status reports the last update 
was friday evening when it was announced atlantis would return to 
earth on monday 
things are going well since we dont hear otherwise said 
billie deason spokeswoman for the national aeronautics and space 
administration 
ted molczan an amateur astronomer in toronto who tracks 
spacecraft said atlantis is 170 miles high two amateur 
astronomers one in florida and the other in texas spotted a 
bright satellite orbiting in front of the shuttle at a slightly 
lower altitude friday night he said 
one of the observers said the satellite was rotating in flashing 
shades of red gold and a yellowish white molczan said 
atlantis returned to space for the first time in eight months 
with a flawless liftoff thursday the shuttle had been grounded 
over the summer by hydrogen leaks that were fixed by installing a 
new external fuel tank plumbing and valve seals 
columbia also was crippled by hydrogen leaks much of the year 
nasa expects to launch the spaceship with seven astronauts and an 
astronomical observatory in early december 
nasa prefers to have at least three weeks between shuttle 
missions but has said it will not wait that long so columbia can 
be up and back by christmas that would enable the agency to shut 
down certain operations at the end of the year for routine 
maintenance and to save on holiday pay 
atlantis is scheduled to land at edwards air force base calif 
sometime between 5 pm and 8 pm est monday mission control will 
break its silence sunday evening to announce a more precise landing 
time 
it is the seventh pentagon shuttle flight to be conducted in 
secrecy and is due to be the last

following is the transcript of an 
address delivered by president vaclav havel on saturday at 
wenceslas square 
ladies and gentlemen dear citizens in recent years and in 
particular in the past few months prior to november 1989 most of 
us felt that tension in our society was building up and the gap 
between promise and performance between the world of official 
speeches and the real world was widening at a spectacular pace 
we guessed that things could not continue the way they did and 
that something was about to happen none of us however knew when 
the crucial change would happen and how it would happen none of us 
knew what would be the last drop to make the cup overflow the 
snowball setting the avalanche in motion 
it was the students who set the avalanche in motion last year 
they decided to commemorate jan opletal and the international 
students day by an independent demonstration what followed is a 
matter of common knowledge 
a year has passed since then 
and today we are standing here somewhat embarrassed we know 
very well what we still have to accomplish and the question 
springing up to mind is why do we find it so difficult to launch 
our joint project off the ground is it because we underestimated 
the legacy of the old regime or overestimated our own capacity is 
it because someone is deliberately trying to thwart our joint 
effort or are we marring our own endeavor 
so it is with full justification that we are asking ourselves 
today why did we fail to achieve this year even that stint of work 
that originally struck us as the simplest job of all namely to 
shed light on all the circumstances of last years massacre and 
punish the real offenders why hasnt historic justice been given 
full rein in a dignified and legally correct way why is our 
political climate systematically poisoned by demagogy by 
political ethnic and racial intolerance why after we had 
toppled in a humane way an inhuman regime the crime rate 
continues to increase at a dizzy rate 
each of these and similar questions can be answered in an 
objective spirit and explained in a plausible fashion in a wide 
variety of ways whatever the answer or explanation the fact 
remains that dissatisfaction nervousness insecurity and 
disillusionment are widespread in our society this is 
understandable and to a certain extent it might serve a good 
purpose for isnt precisely impatience the factor that the 
pressure inspiring a more radical and more speedy implementation of 
social changes nervousness and impatience do not worry me too 
much 
what in my view is far worse are the attendant phenomena ever 
more obvious at every turn rancor rivalry mutual denigration 
envy and boundless ambition it seems to me that these vices 
infecting our public life are ever more rampant 
are we really a nation capable of reviving its virtues only once 
in a twenty years time virtues that only last for a few months 
are we really a nation that only manages to kowtow to the oppressor 
and when the cup finally overflows vie in the bravado of boasting 
speeches and mutual defamation 
i find it hard to believe that this our one and only our sole 
chief historical alternative i find it hard to believe that the 
spirit of tolerance and wisdom could not ultimately prevail in 
slovak souls and in czech and slovak public life 
a small group of students invited the public to devote this 
gathering to what could fittingly be described as meditation in 
which everyone would search his own conscience yes let us try to 
search our own souls today let us try to reflect on our public 
life in the spirit of calm detachment with our own conscience 
being the supreme judge let us try to see ourselves in a broader 
human perspective let us try to visualize the contours of our 
frequently parochial myopic and dimwitted action as perceived by 
the civilized world 
i see much stimulating food for this kind of selfsearching 
thought in the pleasant fact that it is precisely today that we are 
honored by the visit of a representative of one of the worlds 
oldest democracies the supreme representative of the great and 
freedomloving nation the president of the united states of 
america george bush 
more than two hundred years ago the newly arisen state found 
itself confronting a situation very much similar to that 
confronting us today the new democracy was subjected to stringent 
tests and ordeals the distressing financial and economic 
situation doubts about the countrys international status and the 
feuds between different states of the confederation and politicians 
frequently fueled fears for the countrys future integrity the 
adoption of the american constitution was gravely jeopardized 
in the most significant political document of the day in the 
federalist essays alexander hamilton appraised the situation as 
follows among the gravest obstacles obstructing the passage of 
the new constitution one can easily discern the undisguised 
interest of a certain group of people in each state to prevent the 
coming of all changes threatening to restrict their power to 
diminish their profits and the significance of the offices they 
hold and the perverted ambition of another group of people 
determined to profiteer from the confusion prevailing in the 
country the same lines might be written about our own country 
today

the government has said it will expel 
un or other refugee officials who provide aid to burmese 
dissidents living in thailand a newspaper reported saturday 
chamnarn potjana deputy permanent secretary of the interior 
ministry on friday warned international organizations to stop 
helping burmese students according to the nation newspaper 
if they do not chamnarn was quoted as saying no matter 
whether they are officials of the unhcr un high commissioner for 
refugees or other united nations agencies we will ask the foreign 
ministry to expel them from the country as persona non grata 
thailand has close ties to the military government that took 
power in burma in 1988 crushing a studentled prodemocracy 
movement thousands fled and many joined rebel groups based along 
burmas border with thailand and india 
the government began reconsidering the status of burmese 
dissidents after two burmese students hijacked a thai airliner 
flying to their homeland on nov 10 two other burmese students 
hijacked an jetliner to thailand a year ago 
thaung htun a spokesman for the all burma students democratic 
front said the thai government should consider the problem of 
burmese students from a humanitarian point of view any person who 
fled should have the rights of a refugee 
chamnarn spoke after a cabinet committee meeting to discuss what 
measures to take regarding the students he said the committee had 
recommended establishing a holding camp for burmese dissidents on 
the thaiburma border 
the nation quoted chamnarn as saying the high commissioner 
should use the 120000 monthly allowance allocated to burmese 
students to establish the camp 
the private us committee for refugees estimates 2000 burmese 
students live in bangkok another 2700 are on the thaiburma 
border according to the all burma students democratic front the 
main group of exiled students 
thailand considers the students illegal immigrants subject to 
detention fines and deportation the students depend on aid from 
private relief groups and grants from the un high commissioner 
that range from 40 to 120 a month 
according to the us committee for refugees since 1988 
thailand has repatriated more than 5200 burmese many of them 
students amnesty international has cited reports that burmese 
authorities have brutally interrogated and tortured some students 
repatriated from thailand 
the bangkok post quoted chamnarn as saying that in addition to 
the hijacking burmese students were believed responsible for a 
small bomb attack recently on the burmese embassy compound in 
bangkok he said thailand would deport those who violated its 
immigration law and penal code

there is one source of optimism that could be tapped namely 
the fact that the united states overcame the initial spell of 
crisis and developed into a powerful citadel of democracy shared by 
all us citizens while providing at the same time a source of 
inspiration and hope for all those who suffer oppression and 
nonfreedom in other countries 
how did the united states accomplish this goal and how could we 
accomplish it first and foremost america reached consensus on the 
most fundamental piece of national legislation the american 
constitution which codified and today continues to protect the 
fundamental human rights and liberties with unrelenting vigor 
freedom of speech freedom of conviction freedom of assembly and 
association as well as the freedom of addressing requests and 
complaints to the government 
secondly they succeeded in persuading the american legislators 
of the necessity of a strong federal government which however 
retained only the most necessary powers indispensable for the 
exercise of state sovereignty for ensuring the countrys defense 
capability for the protection of the international position of the 
united states as a whole and for the free circulation of material 
and immaterial property throughout the country all other matters 
remained within the legal competence of the states and the people 
and most important of all the americans just because they 
upheld that wideranging decentralization of power gave free scope 
and elbow room to free decision making and creativity this 
decision was expressive of the trust and confidence in the 
prudence common sense and moral integrity of the free citizen it 
reflected the awareness that the citizen and the state are 
answerable to each other only in matters delimited by the law the 
conviction that the citizens are more competent to administer some 
of their affairs than the state itself 
the democratic and prosperous america of today is the outcome of 
the endeavor pooling the efforts of many generations of free 
citizens there is no other path for us to follow but the path of 
the same effort we should each seek and identify our own mistakes 
and errors we should insist on our own freedom without curtailing 
the freedom of others 
dear friends a year ago the freedomloving genius of our 
nations scored a victory over violence and totalitarian rule i am 
convinced that at the present juncture too common sense decency 
and tolerance will triumph in each of us over ambitious rivalry 
egoism and intolerance

ruth knows that smoking marijuana once 
virtually ignored by the public and police is now considered a 
very deviant thing its very taboo 
the 40something san francisco professional is married has 
children and a respectable job she knows that even though 
californias marijuana law is still relatively lenient a drug bust 
could threaten her livelihood 
yet she still smokes highgrade sinsemilla several times a week 
why 
its a very nice high she said often in these drug 
stories people forget to mention that part 
ruth is far from alone marijuana is the most popular illegal 
drug today the crack epidemic notwithstanding 
perhaps as a result 38 states arrest more people for marijuana 
than for cocaine and heroin combined government statistics show 
last year almost 400000 people were busted on some kind of 
marijuana charge 
the drugs popularity stems in part from the fact that it is a 
known quantity almost 66 million americans have tried it at least 
once many of them during its heyday in the 1960s and 1970s the 
1988 national household survey on drug abuse found that 66 million 
americans used it once a week or more and 116 million had used it 
in the previous month 
it is considered relatively safe todays marijuana may be far 
stronger than its counterpart a decade ago as the government says 
but harvard psychiatrist lester grinspoon notes there is no 
reliable evidence of death caused by cannabis in a human being 
and its relatively cheap john a scientist who uses sinsemilla 
several evenings a week says one ounce lasts him six months that 
ounce could cost as little as 100 and the same amount of 
lowergrade marijuana can run 40 
other drugs especially cocaine and heroin are associated 
with high crime and violence particularly in the most populous 
states police officers last year arrested 700000 people for 
cocaine and heroin nationwide more than any other illegal drug 
but in some states nearly every drug arrest involves marijuana 
86 percent in vermont for example 82 percent in north dakota 
and 81 percent in maine according to fbi figures for 1988 
eight of every 10 marijuana busts is for possession of the drug 
the fbi says 
the reason so many people are arrested on marijuana charges 
seems obvious to one group the national organization for the 
reform of marijuana laws which has advocated marijuana 
legalization for two decades 
marijuana users are easier targets than say cocaine 
traffickers said norml spokesman john dunlap theyre a much 
more passive lot the government knows its an easy public 
relations victory 
dunlap also contends there are just more marijuana smokers out 
there he estimates 30 million people use it once a week far more 
than the government estimate of 66 million 
many police departments that once paid little attention to 
marijuana users have changed as attitudes harden toward all illegal 
drugs an example is arizonas maricopa county which includes 
phoenix 
the cops basically sort of ignored it a few years ago said 
bill fitzgerald spokesman for county attorney richard romley 
today the county boasts a do drugs do time program 
targeting all drug users 
every arrested person will be booked into jail for at least a 
few hours said romley and county sheriff thomas agnos in a paper 
describing the program for a casual user even a brief jail stint 
drives home the gravity of the offense 
firsttime offenders may enter a diversion program and 
according to fitzgeralds figures threequarters of the people who 
did had been arrested on marijuana charges 
across america government agencies have staged widely 
publicized raids on outdoor marijuana fields indoor growing labs 
and stores that sell equipment for such labs in an attempt to 
curtail domestic crops that provide an estimated 25 percent of the 
us supply 
the government admits it conducts these raids in large part to 
impress a foreign audience 
we cannot expect foreign countries to undertake vigorous 
antidrug efforts inside their borders if we ourselves fail to do 
likewise says the national drug control strategy issued in 
january 
perhaps another reflection of changing attitudes about drugs 
laws themselves are becoming more stringent 
of the 11 states that decriminalized marijuana possession for 
personal use during the 1970s four have reversed course in recent 
years 
alaska which had actually legalized possession of up to four 
ounces at home or other private places voted nov 6 to make 
possession of small amounts a crime again 
maine ohio and oregon had already tightened marijuana 
restrictions but in seven other states california colorado 
minnesota mississippi north carolina nebraska and new york a 
marijuana arrest is more akin to a traffic ticket than a criminal 
charge 
william j bennett who resigned after 20 months as national 
drug control policy director championed the stricter attitude and 
campaigned for alaskas marijuana measure 
although bennett told the associated press last december that he 
believed marijuana was no more harmful than alcohol he rejected 
legalization the last thing i would want to do is recommend the 
wider use of a drug that makes young people stupid 
despite the increased risks many longtime marijuana smokers 
cannot imagine giving it up 
john the scientist who asked that his real name not be used 
said a single puff of sinsemilla facilitates the imagination and 
has allowed occasional creative breakthroughs some of which have 
led to papers published in reputable journals 
his employers do not require random drug tests but if they did 
that would be enough of an insult to my freedom that i would quit 
and contribute to the brain drain said john who is single 
steven a 34yearold massachusetts attorney and father of two 
said if i didnt use it i think id be an alcohol abuser 
alcohol would hurt his health far more he said 
steven who did not want his last name used recognizes the 
legal dangers but believes he would face only a reprimand not 
disbarment if he were arrested on marijuana charges 
to ruth who also did not want her last name used marijuana is 
the best aphrodisiac there is alcohol is not an acceptable 
substitute 
you get drunk with alcohol she said you get sloppy and 
the next day you have a hangover the worst that can happen with 
marijuana is you get sleepy

bruce springsteens fans didnt change much 
during the singers twoyear performance hiatus 
familiar yells of bruuuuce bruuuuce were so distracting as 
he began his first formal concert since 1988 that the boss had to 
make a request 
id appreciate during the songs just a little quieter so i can 
concentrate on em he told the sellout crowd at the shrine 
auditorium on friday night 
springsteen headed the bill for the concert benefiting the 
christic institute of washington dc the benefit also featured 
jackson browne and grammywinner bonnie raitt 
the show was an acoustic affair and springsteen performed solo 
accompanying himself with guitar piano and harmonica through more 
than a dozen songs including darkness on the edge of town 
tenth avenue freezeout thunder road and my hometown 
his 90minute set including encores with raitt and browne was 
his first formal appearance since the amnesty international human 
rights now tour 
the fans were hungry the 4500 seats available to the public 
sold out in 45 minutes the institute a liberal advocacy group 
got the remaining seats in the 6300seat auditorium a second show 
was added for saturday night 
proceeds from the concert will finance an institute lawsuit 
claiming that the us government sanctioned illegal arms sales and 
drug trafficking to finance private covert operations during the 
irancontra affair 
the lawsuit currently on appeal in a florida court is named la 
penca after a village in nicaragua where a bomb exploded during a 
news conference for contra leader eden pastora in 1984 killing 
three journalists and injuring more than a dozen other people 
raitt said the institute had been having a rough time with the 
lawsuit but thats going to change because the truth will out 
over the past decade the countrys been sold an illusion of 
itself and the christic institute is trying to make everyone 
grow up springsteen told the audience 
he was more effusive about developments in his life 
particularly the birth this july of his son evan he recalled that 
when his girlfriend former backup singer patty scialfa went into 
labor he did lamaze and then went shopping in search of a good 
joke book 
i figured the situation would get tense he explained

a form of vitamin a common in carrots and many other fruits and 
vegetables appears to substantially reduce the risk of heart 
trouble in people who already have coronary artery disease 
researchers have found 
the findings about beta carotene are still considered 
preliminary but they raise the possibility that people whose heart 
arteries are already clogged may be able to ward off heart attacks 
and other cardiac problems by consuming the nutrient

a protein that a researcher calls the heart attack maker is

imogene bassett research institute in cooperstown ny 
a study of white and black doctors in their 50s revealed that 
levels of the protein were more than twice as high in the blacks

cigarettes increase smokers pain tolerance and could therefore 
block the chest pains that serve as a warning for heart disease 
researchers said 
in studies with 20 male smokers ages 19 to 44 the researchers 
found that the tolerance to pain increased with each of three 
cigarettes smoked 
smokers are known to have a higher prevalence of what is called 
silent ischemia said dr paula miller of the university of 
north carolina school of medicine silent ischemia occurs when 
blood flow to the heart is briefly interrupted because of the 
buildup of fatty deposits and cholesterol in the arteries that 
nourish the heart 
millers study suggests cigarettes are at least partly 
responsible for the increased prevalence of silent ischemia in 
smokers

men with clogged heart arteries and mild chest pain can be 
safely treated with medicines alone and bypass surgery does not 
help them live any longer a 10year study concludes 
the study shows that doctors need not rush to perform this 
common form of surgery to save the lives of those with relatively 
nonsevere disease 
its remarkable that there was no difference in total 
survivorship of these patients after 10 years said dr lawrence 
s cohen of yale university a coauthor of the study

hostile teenagers are likely to grow up to be adults who have 
high cholesterol according to a study that finds new links between 
anger and heart trouble 
for years many experts assumed that harddriving impatient 
people with classic type a personalities were at high risk of heart 
attacks but many have grown skeptical of this theory and some now 
believe that the truly lethal personality trait is hostility and 
anger 
people with high hostility at age 19 tend to have high 
cholesterol levels at 40 dr redford b williams of duke 
university said wednesday 
williams study was among several that suggest that hostile 
people are more prone to heart trouble both because of the 
effects of adrenaline and other hormones on their bodies and their 
tendency to have unhealthy living habits

almost twothirds of the 300000 americans who drop dead 
suddenly each year from cardiac arrest might be saved if automatic 
shocking machines were made as common as fire extinguishers heart 
specialists say 
catastrophic disturbances in the hearts normal rhythm what 
doctors call sudden death account for about half of all heart 
disease fatalities 
shocking the heart with a machine called a defibrillator can 
restore normal beating but the shock must be delivered within five 
minutes or the victim will die or suffer brain damage

about 2 million americans unknowingly suffer from a breathing 
disorder called obstructive sleep apnea that doubles their risk of 
dying from a heart attack researchers say 
the disorder in which people stop breathing for 30 to 60 
seconds or longer during sleep is most common in people who snore 
said dr bernard burack a cardiologist at the montefiore medical 
centers sleepwake center in new york 
that doesnt mean everyone who snores is going to drop dead 
burack said but patients with the snoringrelated disorder have a 
risk of heartrelated death 21 times the national average burack

doctors may be giving bad advice about the dangers of heart 
disease by not considering the interaction of risk factors such as 
high blood pressure high cholesterol and smoking 
based on single factor determinations they may be needlessly 
alarming or falsely reassuring patients said dr william b

kannel is one of the principal investigators with the framingham 
heart study a 40yearlong study of 5209 people in framingham 
mass 25 miles west of boston

black agents at the bureau of alcohol tobacco 
and firearms have filed a lawsuit saying the agency discriminates 
in its hiring promotion and evaluation of blacks 
the suit claims the agencys discriminatory policies patterns 
and practices are manifestations of longstanding discrimination 
on the basis of a characteristic common class being black 
the suit filed in us district court here friday seeks 
declaratory injunctive and back pay relief for agents currently 
employed at atf and for as many as 300 individuals who according 
to the suit have sought and been denied employment by the agency 
the bureau established in 1972 under the jurisdiction of the 
treasury department is responsible for enforcement of laws 
relating to alcohol tobacco firearms explosives and interstate 
trafficking in contraband cigarettes 
treasury spokesman jack killorin declined comment on the 
allegations saturday saying it is in the legal process 
michael j riselli one of two attorneys representing the 
agents noted that the atf bureau recently was involved in 
investigations of racially related bombings in georgia and florida 
its pretty striking and significant that youve got an agency 
that from time to time gets called upon to help in civil rights 
cases that doesnt handle its own problems in that area 
riselli said in a telephone interview its been a longstanding 
problem 
riselli said agents larry d stewart of marietta ga and mark 
jones of lorton va had tried to get the agency to deal with the 
concerns in individual informal complaints they filed in june and 
august 1989 
stewart and jones are the plaintiffs named in the class action 
suit 
according to the suit atf employs approximately 2000 special 
agents of whom 160 are black forty of those 160 have been hired 
since april when stewart and jones filed a formal civil rights 
complaint with the department riselli said 
the attorney said most black agents are assigned to positions 
which occupy lower government job classification levels 
theres never been a black agent appointed to an executive 
position and only three have ever been appointed to gm15 merit 
pay or managerial positions riselli said 
additionally riselli said many black agents are hired 
specifically to perform undercover work often involving drug 
cases yet they dont count that service in evaluation for 
promotion 
he said stewart has been with atf since october 1978 and is 
supervisory criminal investigator stewart has a bachelors 
masters and doctoral degree but has been rejected for an executive 
position more than 25 times riselli said

bosniahercegovina whose volatile 
ethnic feuds sparked world war i holds its first free election in 
more than 50 years on sunday the results could be crucial to the 
fragile yugoslav federation 
the central republic is torn by the same bitter geographic 
political and ethnic rivalries that plague yugoslavia as a whole 
ethnic squabbling dominated an acrimonious election campaign 
the three rival nationalist groups serbians croats and 
moslems all have political parties vying for power serbian 
nationalists say that if they lose sundays vote they would refuse 
to recognize the new authorities 
in addition to the ethnicbased groups the vote is being 
contested by the reformed league of communists and premier ante 
markovics alliance of reformist forces those two groups have 
tried to appeal across ethnic barriers 
a victory for any of the nationalist parties would trigger 
uncontrollable tensions said nenad kecmanovic leader of the 
alliance in bosnia 
the nationalist parties are the serbian democratic alliance the 
croatian democratic union and the moslem union of democratic 
action 
stjepan kljuic acting president of the croatian democratic 
union denied that nationalist parties represented a threat he 
said the communists and the alliance were trying to frighten voters 
into believing a nationalist victory would bring chaos and civil 
war 
initial results from last weeks elections in yugoslavias 
poorest state macedonia gave the communists and markovics 
reformers a clear lead over nationalist parties 
bosnias capital sarajevo is bestknown as the site of the 
assassination in 1914 of austrian archduke franz ferdinand by young 
bosnian nationalist gavrilo princip which was the spark that 
ignited world war i 
no single party appeared likely to win a clear majority in 
bosnias 240seat bicameral parliament but opinion polls indicated 
the communists the alliance and the moslems were running ahead 
first official results were not expected until the end of the 
week in the balloting the republics first free vote since 1938 
yugoslavias largest republics of serbia and croatia which 
sandwich bosniahercegovina from the east and west are main rivals 
to steer yugoslavias future political course each has laid 
territorial claims to bosnia in the past 
serbia still under communist rule pending elections dec 9 
wants to keep power centralized in belgrade the serbian and 
federal capital 
croatia where the centerright croatian democratic union ousted 
communists in spring elections wants yugoslavia transformed into a 
loose federation of nearindependent states 
croatia is backed by westernminded slovenia while macedonia 
and montenegro favor maintaining the federation 
bosnia so far has steered a neutral course and its future 
position is to be decided by the election 
both serbian and croatian nationalists claim bosnia for their 
own each group citing close historical and cultural links 
but alija izetbegovic president of the party that says it 
represents the regions estimated 17 million moslems warned 
any attempt to redraw bosnian borders would cause a blaze 
that would engulf all nationalities living in the region 
serbs make up about 30 percent of bosnias population and croats 
about 19 percent of the republics 42 million people traditional 
hostility has existed among the moslems the roman catholic croats 
and the orthodox serbs since yugoslavia was founded as a kingdom in 
1918

new yorks governor unveiled a plan saturday to lay off or 
furlough thousands of state workers and talk of substantial 
layoffs is intensifying in several other northeastern states 
across the nation officials are trying hiring freezes and 
budget manipulations to avoid letting people go but as the economy 
continues to soften many expect state layoffs to become a common 
news item 
everyone is preparing for it said linda carroll of the 
council of state governments 
marcia howard research director for the national association of 
state budget officers said half of the states are experiencing a 
decline in tax revenues a barometer of a weakening economy 
as the states collect less money than expected budget deficits 
grow leaving state executives with the prospect of layoffs 
this is the third year for many states that have had to make 
budget cuts and even raised taxes ms howard said they are 
really to the point where all they can do is cut people 
in states with major deficits stopgap measures like early 
retirement programs and hiring freezes arent enough 
massachusetts has laid off more than 1700 state employees 
including social workers mental health and environmental workers 
since sept 1 state officials spent the last year trying to hold 
off layoffs through attrition 
new york gov mario cuomo proposed a plan saturday to correct a 
potential deficit he said had grown to almost 1 billion the plan 
includes 2000 layoffs and the elimination of an additional 4000 
state jobs through attrition and other actions by the end of the 
current fiscal year march 31 
cuomo also called for all of new yorks 250000 state employees 
to take a mandatory fiveday furlough a move designed to save 
135 million legislators are expected to return to the capital for 
a special session to deal with the budget problem within the next 
several weeks 
in new jersey gov jim florio last week talked of reducing the 
number of state departments and laying off workers this comes 
despite a years hiring freeze and an increase in the state sales 
tax and taxes on cigarettes and liquor 
state treasurer douglas berman announced friday the state budget 
was 600 million in the red and that layoffs were being discussed 
mike moran a spokesman for the new york civil service employees 
association said talk of the impending layoffs has a devastating 
effect among state workers 
people are worried whether they will have their job or wind up 
working huge amounts of overtime to make up for those laid off 
he said whats sad about it is we are talking about people who 
are providing real services 
in new hampshire 150 of the states 10000 workers were cut in 
april dennis parker head of the new hampshire state employees 
association said clients of the health and human services 
department are affected the most 
the phones are ringing a little longer because there are less 
people out there doing the job he said its foolish to think 
youll get the same level of services 
there have been no layoffs in rhode island yet but attrition 
and an early retirement program for state workers have cut 
thousands from the payroll a new state office building built to 
house 900 workers has 650 
still brad southworth the state personnel administrator said 
layoffs are being contemplated 
they are on the table now with any other action that may be 
taken he said 
other states are approaching the same crisis faced in the 
northeast 
lower than expected tax revenues last week prompted california 
gov george deukmejian to present the legislature with a list of 
cuts totaling 1 billion included in the package a hiring freeze 
north carolina has already imposed a hiring freeze texas has 
raised taxes ohio is considering austerity moves michigan faces 
budget cuts 
in georgia pete hackney the legislative budget officer said 
the next legislature faces the prospect of a tax or whack 
budget 
i certainly hope they can be avoided he said of layoffs 
but i dont see how 
other states seek to avoid crisis by taking early action 
despite a budget surplus indiana has reduced the number of 
state workers from 38000 to 36000 through attrition since early 
1989 
and colorado has cut 145 workers at the state department of 
labor a savings of 2 million unlike other states colorado was 
able to make the cuts because of an improving economic picture 
state unemployment has dropped to 45 percent the lowest in 16 
years 
some government watchers believe actual or anticipated layoffs 
of state workers are the conclusion of a growth in public workers 
through the past decade 
david keating executive vice president of the national 
taxpayers union said there are now 505 state and local government 
workers for every 10000 people an increase from 476 at the 
beginning of the 1980s 
its very disingenuous to believe they cant get along with 
fewer workers he said a few years ago they didnt have these 
people on the payroll

steve cowper the high plains drifter 
of alaska politics is about to ride off into the sunset again 
after four bumpy years in the saddle as governor 
his single term will come to an end dec 3 when wally hickel is 
sworn in as alaskas seventh chief executive cowper who at 52 
years old has had a variety of careers says he has not yet decided 
what his next one will be 
a private man who admits a low tolerance for public life cowper 
plans only to head for a warmer locale mexico there he will 
relax in obscurity for a couple of months before returning to his 
adopted hometown of fairbanks 
its a fitting exit for the restless politician whose colleagues 
in the legislature years ago nicknamed him after the clint eastwood 
movie cowboy a takenoguff drifter of few words 
democrat cowper expects a smooth transition to hickel whom he 
considers a friend the veteran republican won the governors race 
on the alaskan independence party ticket nov 6 cowper predicts 
hickel will be more progressive than many of his conservative 
supporters expect 
cowpers latest departure from politics comes 12 years after he 
left his seat in the state house both times he decided not to seek 
reelection 
some people want to cling to public office until they fall 
over dead the virginiaborn cowper says in his thick southern 
drawl ive never been one of that crowd i got out of public 
office before voluntarily and happily i might add 
this time cowper leaves behind a state with an improved economy 
and a higher international profile but with a dubious future that 
remains tied to the upanddown fate of world oil prices 
in an interview cowper said his inability to wean alaska from 
its dependence on oil revenue was a major frustration as oil prices 
plummeted and then recovered three times during his term 
his efforts to promote state income and sales taxes failed when 
rising oil prices eliminated the pressure on lawmakers to turn to 
the more stable revenue sources common in other states 
one of the problems here is that people who stand for public 
office for as long as i can remember have always talked about 
whats going to happen when the oil money runs out but it never 
seems to run out cowper said 
people have gotten to the point where they dont really 
believe it or they dont believe its going to happen in their 
time its very difficult to get anybody to sacrifice anything for 
something that may happen three years from now or 30 years from 
now 
and what about hickels promises to reduce the budget 
my observation would be that normally if you have a large 
surplus its extraordinarily difficult to make major budget 
cuts cowper said because of the rise in oil prices since iraq 
invaded kuwait alaska could reap up to a billiondollar surplus 
next year 
cowper considers his efforts to improve the economy as the top 
achievement of his administration 
when i was elected the alaska economy was in a very severe 
downturn he said it was clear that the no 1 thing on any 
governors agenda had to be to do whatever was necessary to put the 
alaskan economy back on track 
you can look at the figures today and tell that that was 
done he said 
cowper cites as examples the successful effort to get a federal 
express cargo hub in anchorage the administrations promotion of 
international trade its work with federal regulators to get the 
states banking system in order and his 1988 jobs bill 
the outgoing governor says he also laid the groundwork for 
future trade and social ties with the soviet far east 
in the legislature cowpers victories included the tightening 
of a major oiltax break and major oilspill legislation after the 
exxon valdez disaster but he also endured some major defeats 
cowper repeatedly was unable to get one of his favorite ideas 
the education fund through the legislature the proposal would 
have set aside earnings from the permanent fund alaskas 
oilwealth savings account to pay for education as oil revenues 
decline 
that defeat was symbolic of what cowper says is a tendency for 
todays generation to grab everything they can as cheaply as 
possible and leave the next generation holding the bag 
i think we have a duty to make the world better for the next 
generation and i frankly dont think many people agree with me 
but almost everything we did reflected that philosophy he said

tens of thousands converged 
saturday in central prague to commemorate the beginning of the end 
of communist rule in czechoslovakia and to cheer president bush for 
standing behind their new democracy 
about 100000 people crowded into pragues wenceslas square the 
site of daily demonstrations last year that led to the demise of 
the communist leadership and the election of former dissident 
vaclav havel as president 
the events began on nov 17 last year when police brutally beat 
down a peaceful demonstration by students 
people streamed to the square hours ahead of the planned 
appearance of bush and havel some stopped to purchase caps printed 
in patches of the american flag or buttons bearing the us 
presidents photograph 
one young man exhibiting the entrepreneurial spirit that will 
be needed for a successful transformation to a market economy 
hawked coppercolored medals pressed by his fatherinlaw depicting 
havel pope john paul ii and the first president of czechoslovakia 
tomas g masaryk 
kids hung from the trees lining the square and students and 
adults waved czechoslovak and american flags 
it is a kind of symbol that bush came this very day said 
zdenek stojan a 27yearold building engineer it shows support 
of the united states for this country 
he recalled president woodrow wilsons support of masaryks 
drive to create an independent czechoslovakia in 1918 saying 
the americans were at the cradle of the first republic 
one couple who happened upon the ceremony while on a day trip 
to the capital from their home town in central czechoslovakia 
purchased a czechlanguage copy of the us constitution saying 
they were curious about its contents 
some felt the timing of the presidents visit was inappropriate 
there are lots of celebrations around bush and the students 
who started it are almost forgotten said petr novotny a driver 
about 3000 people whistled during havels speech expressing 
dislike of his policies and the invitation to bush 
the current visit of president bush is based on the fact that 
americans are often confused said miroslav sladek the leader of 
the rightwing republican party which failed to gain parliamentary 
seats in the june elections 
he charged the bush trip was aimed at boosting what he called 
the waning authority of havel and the political movement he 
founded civic forum which won the june elections 
but jiri votruba an artist said bushs visit was welltimed 
because its a symbolic day and symbols especially in eastern 
countries are very important 
i believe it is important that people here feel that someone 
as important as the us president is standing behind them because 
people fear it wont be as rosy as they had hoped votruba said 
and bush received bellowing applause when he pledged to stand 
behind the new democracy 
america will not fail you at this decisive moment america 
will stand with you bush said his speech was translated into 
czech for the crowd 
bush who was applauded several times during his speech also 
praised havel describing him as a man of wisdom and tremendous 
moral courage 
the us president promised two gifts to the czechoslovak 
people masaryks 1918 declaration of czechoslovak independence 
drafted in the united states and kept for 70 years in the library 
of congress and the last replica of the liberty bell 
we want to help you spread liberty throughout your beautiful 
land he said then tolled the bell three times once for your 
courage once for your freedom and once for your children 
the fervent applause that followed his speech subsided only as 
the crowd joined in singing we shall overcome the anthem the 
students sang as they faced cudgelswinging police who trapped them 
in a narrow street near the square on this day last year 
many had tears in their eyes as they raised their hands in a 
vforvictory sign singing the song over and over in both english 
and czech the crowd dispersed with chants of long live havel 
im glad i lived long enough to see american flags on 
wenceslas square said jindriska maderova 48 the bell was a 
very beautiful gift

floridas two us senators are urging the 
fbi to release information gathered during an inquiry into the 
murder of a tampa reporter in a cocainegrowing area of peru last 
year a newspaper reported saturday 
sens bob graham a democrat and connie mack a republican 
want fbi director william sessions to reconsider his agencys 
refusal to disclose the file on the death of todd c smith the 
tampa tribune reported 
the newspaper requested the file last year under the federal 
freedom of information act 
one year after todd smiths death the nature of his brutal 
murder following his kidnapping and apparent torture is 
enveloped in a shroud of mystery this case deserves to be 
expedited by the fbi the senators wrote in a letter sent friday 
the fbi was asked by peruvian officials to investigate the 
murder shortly after smiths body was found last nov 21 in uchiza 
a small cocaine boom town in a remote area of peru 
smith taking a working vacation from the tribune to research 
cocaine trafficking and terrorism was kidnapped at gunpoint from 
an airstrip in perus upper huallaga valley on nov 17 1989 
his body was found beside a soccer field four days later 
officials said he had been strangled and beaten and had been dead 
for about 24 hours 
a sign found near the body denounced smith as a spy linked to 
the pentagon it was signed by the communist party of peru the 
official name of shining path a maoist group that launched an 
allout guerrilla war in the peruvian highlands in 1980 more than 
20000 peruvians have died in that war 
us and peruvian officials have not revealed more details about 
the killing 
eight months after the tribune made its request the fbi said it 
found one file with information about smith but refused to disclose 
it claiming it would interfere with enforcement proceedings 
the agency has refused to elaborate on the nature of the file or 
say whether the case remains open but attorney general dick 
thornburgh recently assured the newspaper that the investigation is 
continuing 
the state department which operates an antinarcotics force in 
the upper huallaga valley near where smith was killed offered 
little information 
smiths father robert said he was satisfied to believe 
shining path killed his son 
i doubt anyone has access to anyone who has knowledge or the 
willingness to talk about it he said 
shortly after smiths death reports surfaced that he had been 
sold as an undercover drug agent to a colombian narcotics 
trafficker for a bounty of 30000 perus former interior minister 
endorsed that story but journalists and us embassy officials 
have since cast doubt on it

orlando lucas brought his family back 
to nicaragua the day after president violeta chamorro was 
inaugurated in april ending years of exile in brazil venezuela 
and the united states 
with the leftist sandinista front gone from power and mrs 
chamorros promise of a new beginning it was time to return 
because as lucas thought theres no place like home 
seven months later lucas regrets his decision he is one of a 
growing number of people disenchanted with mrs chamorros 
administration 
this is a fiasco said lucas an agronomist in his mid40s 
mrs chamorros supporters stewing in discontent for months 
are now protesting because her government has made concessions to 
the opposition sandinistas to buy social peace 
she took office april 25 after a resounding victory over 
sandinista president daniel ortega in feb 25 elections but mrs 
chamorro allowed sandinista commanders to remain at the head of the 
military and police 
those who complain say that while they believe mrs chamorro is 
wellintentioned the minister of the presidency antonio lacayo 
treats the sandinistas with kid gloves and the presidents 
supporters with an iron fist 
lacayo believed by most nicaraguans the power behind mrs 
chamorro has said his countrymen must shed a winnertakesall 
political heritage and learn to coexist peacefully and share with 
the losers 
the simmering discontent boiled over two weeks ago into a 
protest movement by mayors and demobilized contra rebels in the 
rich agricultural region around juigalpa 85 miles southeast of 
managua 
protesters want mrs chamorro to deliver on promises of land and 
aid for the former usbacked rebels who for nine years fought the 
leftist sandinistas 
by the governments own figures barely 3000 of the 20000 
rebels who finished disbanding in june have received land 
our mistake was scheduling the layingdown of our weapons and 
failing to schedule the fulfillment of her promises said oscar 
sovalbarro a former contra leader also known as commander 
ruben 
the sandinista army and police were the only ones who came 
out ahead he said now that we have disarmed we feel 
repressed and threatened 
the mayors and former rebels also want mrs chamorro to fire 
army chief gen humberto ortega brother of the former sandinista 
president and the regional chiefs of the sandinista police and 
sandinista peoples army 
i voted for a change theres been no change said jose luis 
gutierrez a civilian who helped the contras when they were still 
guerrillas roaming the lush hills of boaco and chontales provinces 
fighting the sandinistas 
the mayors and former rebels have also asked mrs chamorro to 
fire interior minister carlos hurtado in charge of the police and 
lacayo the presidents soninlaw 
lucas gutierrez the mayors and exrebels are not alone in 
their discontent 
mrs chamorros attempts to reconcile her countrymen in 
postsandinista nicaragua have resulted only in alienating nearly 
all those sectors that helped bring her to power 
business leaders are bitter returning exiles are dismayed the 
former rebels feel betrayed the roman catholic church led by 
cardinal miguel obando y bravo has been unusually outspoken in 
condemning her governments actions 
mrs chamorros 14party coalition is deeply divided 
even her own family newspaper la prensa published a stinging 
editorial this week entitled the president sees with a limited 
perspective 
it chided mrs chamorro for asking protesters to go back to 
their homes and jobs and accused her of failing to grasp the 
countrys political reality 
they cannot go back to work as president chamorro would like 
because armed sandinistas are the only law that prevails in many 
regions of the country especially the areas where the protests 
have occurred the editorial said 
it accused mrs chamorro of allying herself with those who are 
really sabotaging her healthy government policy a reference to 
the sandinistas 
even her estranged vice president virgilio godoy is rumored to 
have been stirring up the protest movement godoy while denying 
his involvement called it a beautiful civic protest 
the protest movement has blocked off onefifth of the country 
and resulted in 10 deaths and dozens of wounded in clashes between 
police and protesters

robert kearns voice lacked the giddiness one 
would expect from someone about to get a 102 million check from a 
huge corporation to the 63yearold inventor getting justice from 
the patent system is even more important than the money 
kearns settled a 12yearold patent infringement lawsuit against 
ford motor co last week and he still has similar suits pending 
against other automakers 
at issue was his patent for intermittent windshield wipers 
which go on and off periodically they are a part of nearly every 
new car sold these days 
for kearns who lives in a onebedroom rented apartment with 
rented furniture in houston the money isnt bad but the case is 
mainly about winning fairness 
i dont mean to be so harsh on the patent system but an 
infringer can just follow what has happened in this case and usurp 
the ability of inventors to start new businesses kearns said in 
a telephone interview from a friends house in maryland where the 
settlement was approved 
ford attorney malcolm wheeler said the settlement was fair but 
ford would have won if the case had been retried 
there will be several million left for kearns after the ford 
settlement is shared with his attorneys it will easily be enough 
to buy a house he wants in texas and to finance his legal battles 
against 19 other automakers 
if i dont go further there really isnt a patent system 
he said 
each of kearns suits alleges basically the same thing that 
the companies profited from his windshield wiper patent and he 
should share the money they made 
settling the cases or winning in jury trials could mean more 
millions for kearns and millions more for attorneys 
kearns and one member of his legal team bill durkee of houston 
declined to say how much the case against ford cost there have 
been estimates that legal bills ran more than 300000 a standard 
contingency fee of one third of the settlement would give durkees 
firm 3 million to 4 million 
lawyers are running a business kearns said im running 
a cause 
kearns had claimed he installed a set of intermittent wipers on 
a ford and took it to the automaker kearns a professor at wayne 
state university in detroit at the time said he was led to believe 
ford would buy his invention by the number of questions engineers 
asked 
when that failed to happen he sued 
originally kearns sought 141 million from ford in july a 
jury ordered ford to pay 52 million plus interest for patent 
infringement for a total of 85 million to 115 million kearns 
appealed the award and the settlement was reached before the appeal 
could be decided 
ford dealers have sold an estimated 20 million ford lincoln and 
mercury cars with intermittent wipers after legal defense costs 
the settlement nets kearns 33 cents per car 
the problem as kearns sees it is the patent systems failure to 
protect small inventors from predator corporations by making it 
difficult to prove the validity of their patents 
the mere mention of some similar device recorded somewhere 
before the patent was issued could be ammunition in a corporations 
legal guns 
the inventor is up against every dusty lbrary in the world 
kearns said 
in some cases the patent system works fine 
if a person was an inventor whose only intent was to conceive 
of something and then pass it on to someone else maybe thats 
still viable kearns said 
but when someone like kearns wants to bring an invention to 
market the patent system is a roadblock because it allows for a 
legal morass like the one kearns found himself in 
and that goes back to money 
i think the thing that would help the inventors most would be 
fast trials said patent attorney richard samuel of philadelphia 
he represented gordon gould in his successful patent fight over the 
laser 
i think that probably from a legal perspective the problem is 
more one of the cumbersomeness of the courts samuel said its 
an expensive process and the individual inventor cant afford to go 
through the courts 
samuel said things are getting better for inventors though in 
the early 1980s a federal appeals court was established just for 
patent cases

pope john paul ii has promised to push forward 
efforts especially in eastern europe to spread the message that 
antisemitism is a sin a british jewish leader said saturday 
the pope met with directors of the british council for 
christians and jews at the vatican on friday and told them he was 
very pleased about continuing contacts between the two faiths 
including a meeting in prague in september 
catholic delegates at that meeting condemned antisemitism as 
well as all forms of racism as a sin against god and humanity 
that statement came at the end of the first formal meeting in 
five years of the pontifical commission on religious relations with 
the jews and the international jewish committee on interreligious 
consultations 
sir sigmund sternberg a british jewish leader present at the 
meeting friday with the pope said he was encouraged that john paul 
repeated the words of the prague declaration 
he said he told the polishborn pontiff that he was concerned 
about the growth of antisemitic incidents in eastern europe and 
expressed his concern that the popes view be known at the 
grassroots level 
the pope assured me that he would get the message out at the 
parish level about antisemitism being regarded as a sin sternberg 
said 
he expressed optimism about efforts started after the second 
vatican council in the early 1960s to improve relations between 
religions 
you cannot undo in 25 years the damage done in more than 1900 
years he said 
a plan drawn up at the prague conference called for the 
establishment of courses for priests to counter antijewish 
sentiment it also recommended swift dissemination of recent 
vatican statements on catholicjewish relations by eastern european 
churches 
sternberg was involved in helping to defuse a major dispute that 
threatened to derail efforts to mend roman catholicjewish 
relations 
the dispute centered on the presence of a catholic convent just 
outside the site of the world war ii concentration camp at 
auschwitz or oswiecim poland 
jewish groups said the convent and its christian symbols 
including a 23foothigh cross offended the memory of the 25 
million jews who were put to death in the camp only because they 
were jews 
after bitter controversy it was decided to construct a 
religious center for the nuns about a quartermile from the death 
camp

more than 50000 demonstrators marched through rome 
on saturday demanding the truth about the anticommunist network 
known as gladio established during the cold war and kept secret 
until recently 
the protest organized by the communist party also called for 
more disclosure about a series of mysterious terrorist attacks in 
italy from 1969 through the early 1980s 
the communists italys secondbiggest party have speculated 
that gladio may have been linked to the terrorist attacks 
attributed to the right wing from 1969 to the early 1980s when the 
party came to the brink of power 
we are here to obtain truth and transparency communist 
party leader achille occhetto told the crowd in the central piazza 
del popolo at the end of the march 
premier giulio andreotti last month disclosed the existence of 
gladio a network of civilians trained by the italian secret 
services to form a guerrilla movement in the event of a foreign 
attack it was active until last month 
since his announcement other european governments have 
acknowledged similar organizations in their countries several were 
coordinated through nato and some received us aid 
traffic police said between 50000 and 60000 people took part 
in the demonstration while national police put the number at 
100000 organizers said 400000 people joined in 
some marchers dressed up as gladiators gladio was named for the 
doublededged swords carried by roman gladiators 
occhetto on saturday called for a special parliamentary 
commission to investigate gladio he also reiterated his demand 
that andreotti step down for having failed to disclose the 
existence of the group 
so far none of the five parties forming the coalition 
government has endorsed the demands 
parliament last week opened hearings on the secret operation 
gladio is also under investigation by a rome magistrate 
in germany meanwhile a magazine reported saturday that the job 
of the german banch of gladio was preparation for sabotage attacks 
and resistance behind enemy lines 
the government said friday the german branch still exists but a 
government spokesman said the units would not have been assigned to 
conduct behindthelines sabotage operations 
the weekly magazine spiegel said the german branch had 
operated beginning in 1959 it said that the allied coordination 
committee at nato had ordered the dissolution of the secret 
network and that germany was to try to accomplish this by 1991 
the report appearing in the magazines monday edition was made 
available in advance to other news organizations

on an island in the tigris just a little 
south of saddam husseins presidential palace a small group of 
europeans say they are risking their lives for peace 
it is an idea they hope catches on 
the idea is to work toward filling the battlefield with peace 
workers before any war can break out this has never been done 
before in history said ulf amsell a lanky 46yearold transport 
worker from sweden 
if more people follow my idea it can be effective perhaps 
5000 would be enough this is my purpose 
amsell and his companions at the world peace and friendship camp 
say they are voluntarily making themselves human shields in 
this country that is already holding thousands of other westerners 
against their will including some detained at potential military 
targets 
iraqi officials are delighted to host the european pacifists in 
the tiny island cottages usually reserved for honeymooners 
their willing presence in iraqi eyes bolsters the government 
argument that the western hostages are guests playing a role for 
peace by deterring an attack by us and allied forces in saudi 
arabia 
but unlike their compatriots these europeans can leave iraq 
whenever they want and most plan to stay only for a week or two 
i am not afraid they will keep me here said jon peter oie 
31 of norway no one in the world can come here if they keep the 
peace workers officials from iraqs ministry of information and 
culture have arranged lectures on iraqi history for the europeans 
and bus tours to factory sites around baghdad they also trot the 
peace activists out before the world press 
weve received many requests and applications from peace 
activists from various parts of the world to establish peace camps 
in many parts of iraq in many towns and even on the front lines 
information minister latif nsayyif jassim said saturday 
we highly appreciate and respect all these volunteers who have 
come here to serve peace out of human and moral considerations 
he added 
on saturday the europeans were taken to a clothing factory in 
baghdad where they were cheered by the women behind the sewing 
machines 
they were also told by the plant manager that the invasion of 
kuwait is an arab problem that can only be settled by saddams aug 
12 proposal which linked the crisis to the solution of all other 
middle east problems 
we do not support the iraqi government insisted rino la 
rocca a 38yearold photographer from naples we have been very 
critical of the government i support the iraqi people during this 
very dangerous situation 
we are testifying with our physical presence to our desire to 
avoid war he said 
we have been criticized by leftist parties in italy for coming 
here added nesi manlio 36 another of the 13 italians at the 
camp but the parties just say a lot of words about war and do 
nothing to stop it 
it is too easy to be against war in italy i have a job a 
car a house it is too easy to say you are against the war here i 
am risking my life and that is important he added 
the group at the camp also includes six soviets led by 
stanislov korolev a professor of theology in moscow 
he said the soviets had never heard of the camp until they were 
taken there by iraqi authorities after their arrival in baghdad 
outside the camps cottages are posted signs in french and 
english with slogans such as messengers of peace greet saddam 
hussein man of the hour and usa enemy of man 
cut off heads not sustenance read one 
the signs were put up by the iraqis and some were decorated 
with pictures of saddam 
the peace activists emphasized that their presence did not mean 
support for saddam 
i dont want to be used by anybody i dont support the iraqi 
government said oie i only support peace 
antonella straface 28 of bari italy an islamic philosophy 
student at the university of naples said she had come to iraq to 
visit two friends held hostage and to see it with my own eyes 
she said she did not believe what was written about iraq in 
western newspapers 
the west has supported the policy of this government all of 
us know the policy of this man saddam the policies against the 
kurdish people the people of iran but no newspaper in italy wrote 
against those policies

thousands of elated children greeted santa 
claus on saturday as the santa train made a bittersweet ride 
through the impoverished appalachian mountains 
about 12 tons of toys snacks and gifts were tossed to eager 
children and a few greedy adults as the train made its 48th 
annual run through kentucky virginia and tennessee the train 
ride kicks off the christmas season for small coal towns between 
pikeville ky and kingsport tenn 
but many who helped santa toss gifts to excited youngsters 
lining the tracks spoke of the experience with a tinge of sorrow 
if you can go and throw this stuff off without crying youre 
a better man than i said darrell rice of kingsport one of the 
dozens of volunteers aboard the train 
the trip is sponsored by csx transportation of jacksonville 
fla and the kingsport area chamber of commerce companies across 
the nation donate boxes of merchandise magnetic backgammon sets 
pencils packets of instant oatmeal bags of pretzels and comic 
books 
one of the trains seven stops was in elkhorn city ky 
straddling the kentuckyvirginia border marietta hogson of 
ferrells creek guarded her 5yearold son adam as a crowd 
clamored for santas attention 
im afraid hell get trampled if he gets too close mrs 
hogson said 
the train winds through the major coal producing areas of 
appalachia where some communities are suffering from coal industry 
layoffs csx and chamber of commerce officials say the gummy bears 
and tablets that kids pluck from between the rail ties may be all 
they receive for christmas 
gregory belcher of elkhorn city disagreed 
a lot of people are out of work in this area but i dont 
think its that bad he said belchers son christopher dropped 
off an armload of tablets pencils and a cookbook and then 
sprinted back to the crowd for more 
the focus of this as far as im concerned is the great 
tradition of the train said frank brogden who has served as 
santa claus since 1984 i think some people would think they 
would be put down a bit if you focus on poverty 
parents with video cameras showed up at many of the train 
crossings and the seamy side of christmas was apparent as a group 
of adults chased the train from crossing to crossing in 
southwestern virginia to hoard gifts 
csx spokesman tim hensley wouldnt specify the cost of the train 
ride formally known as the santa claus special 
it costs a whole lot of good will hensley said we 
operate this train from the bottom of our heart not the bottom 
line 
the tradition began in 1943 when the line was part of the 
clinchfield railroad organizing and distributing the gifts is a 
dizzying effort for 38 years raymond galyon of kingsport has 
helped solicit donations from merchants and businesses 
i put about 300 hours a year doing this said galyon 
sitting atop boxes of gifts this years bounty was valued between 
150000 to 200000 he said 
at a stop in st paul volunteers furiously tossed buckets of 
gifts at the crowd as christmas carols played on a tape player 
santa handed out the larger toys plastic trucks or dolls to 
youngsters 
the christmas spirit aboard the train was infectious in large 
part because of lois mee of durham nc she donated 30 boxes of 
gifts including 243 dolls with handknitted dresses 112 pair of 
mittens and hundreds of suckers 
honey this is the happiest day of my life im so thrilled i 
cant get over it said mrs mee dressed in a bright red sweater 
and green jacket im tenderhearted i guess if i was a 
millionaire i wouldnt have a dime

us navy seals checked a landing 
zone for mines and obstacles saturday to prepare for a mock assault 
from the sea by us and saudi marines in an exercise menacingly 
named imminent thunder 
about 500 to 800 troops will hit the beach sunday commanders 
said the key objective is to practice an assault from ships that 
are 30 miles from shore 
the technique is called overthehorizon which gives the 
attackers the element of surprise because an enemy wont know which 
beach is targeted 
its a new capability nobody else has it said rear adm 
john b laplante commander of the amphibious strike force 
the war games also allow troops to practice the tricky work of 
getting troops ashore under cover of warplanes troops will be 
ferried by landing craft and attack helicopters launched 
simultaneously 
amphibious warfare is an immensely complex thing to bring 
off laplante said its difficult and it takes practice and 
training 
among the first tanks to hit the beach will be an m60 model 
nicknamed sodamn insane cpl james quade 25 of lexington 
park md said the amphibious exercises have become so commonplace 
that many marines are treating it as just another day 
the only part we get geared up about is to make sure we dont 
have any of the tanks go down said quade a forward observer 
with alpha company of the 2nd tank battalion 
reports of the sixday exercise were taken from pool reports 
based on briefings given aboard the uss nassau the flagship for 
the amphibious landing 
imminent thunder is the fourth amphibious exercise staged in the 
gulf since operation desert shield was launched in august 
however it is the first on saudi soil the first to involve 
us and saudi marines and the largest force of warplanes used in 
war games by a multinational force assembled to check iraqi 
president saddam hussein 
about 1100 aircraft are involved in the exercise but military 
officials said they wont all be airborne at once 
it doesnt mean the skies at the beach are going to be black 
with aircraft said lt cmdr ron morse a us navy spokesman 
one of the objectives is to keep aircraft from running into each 
other flight controllers have given different ceilings to 
helicopters and attack jets such as av8b harrier close support 
jets fa18 hornets f14 tomcats and a6 intruders 
about 50 british aircraft are also involved in the drill 
including nimrod surveillance planes and tornado and jaguar attack 
jets 
the biggest challenge is to make sure we have aircraft 
separation said cmdr mickey haskins commanding officer of 
tactical air control squadron 22 
navy cmdr dave stewart also known as air boss controls 
the harriers and cobra helicopter gunships from the flight deck of 
the nassau 
this is my fifth national crisis in about 20 years and 
theyre all about the same stewart said 
although the number of warplanes was significant laplante said 
the number of marines and ships involved was very modest in size 
and scope 
imminent thunder involves 16 ships including the aircraft 
carrier uss midway and its battle group and the battleship uss 
wisconsin five amphibious assault ships are being used 
iraq has called imminent thunder a provocative act the 
pentagon has denied it was designed to stir up the iraqis 
officials say the landing will be about 100 miles south of the 
kuwaiti border on an unnamed saudi beach

lebanons most influential shiite moslem 
cleric on saturday urged the release of all western hostages on 
humanitarian grounds in his second such appeal in three days 
we have to work for closing the file of the hostages and those 
unjustifiably detained be they iranians americans europeans or 
lebanese sheik mohammed hussein fadlallah said 
this whole file should be closed because it is a humanitarian 
issue fadlallah is the spiritual guide of the iranianbacked 
hezbollah or party of god the umbrella organization for 
underground shiite factions believed holding most of the 13 
westerners in lebanon including six americans 
to those who think that releasing the hostages would be in 
favor of the western states we say it would be in favor of 
humanity which is not separate from islamic values fadlallah 
said in a statement 
the spiritual leader made a similar appeal thursday 
more than 300 shiite moslems are held at the khiam prison in 
southern lebanon controlled by the israeliaffiliated south 
lebanon army militia several are hezbollah fighters 
their release along with that of arab prisoners held in israel 
has frequently figured among demands put forward by the captors of 
western hostages 
hezbollah says an undisclosed number of its members are held by 
christian militias in east beirut 
fadlallah did not directly link release of the western captives 
to revealing the fate of four missing iranians or the release of 
arabs in khiam and israel 
fadlallahs past statements encouraging the release of western 
hostages appear to have had no tangible effect on the kidnappers 
despite the influence of his religious authority 
but when a group calling itself organization islamic dawn 
released americans robert polhill and frank reed in april it said 
the releases were partly at the behest of senior religious 
leaders 
relatives of the four iranians who disappeared in lebanons 
christian enclave in 1982 arrived here tuesday in an effort to 
obtain information 
they have met with politicians and religious officials they say 
they received information that the four are being held at a prison 
run by christian warlord samir geagea in the faraya ski resort 
northeast of beirut 
geageas lebanese forces militia has said however the four 
were killed by rival christian chief elie hobeika 
the iranians crossed into the christian heartland saturday for a 
30minute audience with patriarch nasrallah sfeir spiritual head 
of lebanons dominant maronite catholic community 
the patriarch said he had conflicting reports about the fate of 
the iranians and that he would try to establish the truth about 
their fate 
the longest held of the 13 missing westerners is terry anderson 
chief middle east correspondent for the associated press he was 
kidnapped march 16 1985

flag flew outside instead of a traditional black flag kashours 
19yearold son burhan was by arab accounts the first to be

instances of unsupervised gunfire 
there has been a shakeup within the police but no disciplinary 
action was taken against officers mentioned in the report 
the temple mount is known to arabs as haram essharif or 
noble sanctuary tradition says prophet mohammed ascended to 
heaven from the spot it is also revered by the jews as the site of 
their ancient temple destroyed by the romans 
god gave burhan to me and god took him away said kashour a 
devout moslem what makes it easier is that we believe in god 
his wife wept 
a picture of burhan hung on the wall surrounded by flowers and 
about a dozen small plagues brought by visitors hundreds came to 
kashours house saturday to pay their respects burhans teachers 
former classmates amd neighbors 
atop the house and on a nearby roof there were also two 
outlawed palestinian flags and strips of cloth covered with verses 
from the koran islams holy book 
the crowd occasionally broke into nationalist songs palestine 
needs men to become martyrs and palestine must return 
kashour proudly recalled his son an athlete who could jump 
more than three meters high burhan one of the familys seven 
children was never jailed during the 35monthold palestinian 
uprising and planned to study art in the united states 
last time i saw him it was 10 in the morning kashour said 
half an hour later he was dead he went to pray and was killed 
now i go every day to pray on his blood 
elsewhere in the arab east jerusalem on saturday police 
arrested three schoolgirls and closed a school after several 
stonethrowing incidents officials said

school girls demonstrated and threw stones at police near the 
mamuniye school police dispersed them by firing tear gas grenades 
and three of the girls were arrested he said 
witnesses said that several girls lost consciousness after being 
overcome by tear gas others ran into the st george hospital 
nearby and police were seen throwing tear gas grenades into the 
hospital compound 
it was the third day of scattered demonstrations in the annexed 
eastern part of the city which israel captured from jordan in the 
1967 middle east war 
the demonstrations were linked to the second anniversary 
thursday of the palestinians proclamation of independence in

arabs have been killed by israeli soldiers or civilians in the 
revolt fiftytwo israelis have died in the violence

the governing party has proposed a new 
strategy of democratic socialism and economic reform breaking with 
15 years of marxist rule 
the central committee of the popular movement for the liberation 
of angola announced the new strategy friday night after a threeday 
meeting 
there was no immediate response from the rebels of unita the 
national union for the total independence of angola 
the announcement came as a delegation from the government met in 
portugal with the usbacked unita rebels for the latest round of 
peace talks to end a 15yearold civil war and prepare angolas 
transition to democracy 
the talks mediated by the portuguese government were private 
a portuguese official said a statement would be released only after 
the talks ended probably monday 
the two sides have met five times in portugal in the past eight 
months 
fridays governing party statement said the party would work to 
introduce a mixed economy in angola with protection for private 
property and foreign investment 
sources close to the central committee said the declaration was 
a compromise between party liberals and hardliners 
the governing partys rise to power after the collapse of 
portuguese colonial rule in angola sparked a long conflict fueled 
by heavy infusions of foreign weaponry 
south africa backed the unita rebels with troops and arms 
against the communist government while cuba sent about 50000 
troops to back the mpla in the civil war 
the united states and the soviet union sent arms to back their 
allies in the war which according to government figures has 
killed more than 350000 people 
under a 1988 peace accord south africa pledged to halt aid to 
unita and cuban troops began a pull out scheduled to end next 
summer 
however heavy fighting has continued and both superpowers 
maintain arms supplies to angola 
the governing party has recently announced its acceptance of 
multiparty government last month president jose eduardo dos 
santos said opposition parties could be legalized early next year 
and elections held within three years of a ceasefire 
the unita rebels are demanding further political guarantees and 
want elections before december 1991

sales an acquaintance of dashtis came in to weavers shop and 
warned him of dashtis mental problems

about 300 nationalist 
activists jeered and threw stones saturday at a speaker addressing 
some 30000 slovaks gathered to celebrate the first anniversary of 
communisms downfall in czechoslovakia 
the small group of activists surrounded the speakers rostrum on 
bratislavas national uprising square and began whistling and 
throwing stones as former dissident miroslav kusy addressed the 
rally celebrating last years velvet revolution that ended four 
decades of communist rule 
the nationalists waved banners reading independent slovakia 
and prague go home at the rally called by public against 
violence leading party in slovakias coalition government and 
sister movement to czechoslovak president vaclav havels civic 
forum 
slovak nationalism suppressed under the communists has been 
rising since last november radicals are not satisfied with federal 
government moves to devolve more powers to both czech and slovak 
republics 
kusy a prominent philosopher and rector of bratislavas 
komensky university was visibly shaken as he ducked flying stones 
and he called on the crowd for support 
the crowds responded by falling silent police at the edge of 
the square could not intervene there were no clashes between the 
two groups of demonstrators 
the marred rally contrasted with the enthusiastic anniversary 
celebrations in prague where tens of thousands packed central 
wenceslas square to cheer president bush for standing by their 
fledgling democracy 
the nationalists began protesting after kusy criticized slovak 
separatists saying they should decide for nonviolence peace and 
legal means 
he urged positive relations between all nationalities in 
slovakia saying special respect should be shown for the regions 
600000 minority hungarians 
calls have become more strident recently for slovak secession 
from the czechoslovak federation formed in 1918 disbanded by the 
nazis and forcibly reformed by the communists in 1968 
nationalist radicals were outraged last month when slovakias 
parliament passed a law allowing ethnic hungarians to use their 
language officially in areas where they make up 20 percent of the 
population 
angry protesters marched through bratislava calling for a 
tougher law and demanding the governments resignation and 25 
nationalists began a hunger strike in protest

a homeless man convicted of murder is 
appealing his case to the state supreme court arguing his 
constitutional rights were violated when police searched his 
makeshift home beneath an interstate highway 
david mooneys case which the court is expected to decide soon 
raises for the first time in connecticut the question of whether 
the privacy of homeless people is protected by the fourth 
amendment 
the fourth amendment protects the rights of individuals to be 
secure in their persons houses papers and effects against 
unreasonable searches and seizures 
mooney now serving a 50year sentence at somers state prison 
contends the search was unreasonable because police did not have a 
search warrant which they would have needed to search a more 
traditional residence 
mooney was homeless and living beneath interstate 91 in new 
haven for a brief period in the summer of 1987 when police were 
investigating the strangulation death of theodore genovese a 
48yearold hospital worker in new haven 
another suspect in the case implicated mooney charging that he 
and mooney went to visit genovese ostensibly for a homosexual 
liaison but in fact to rob him mooney has denied any involvement 
in the crime 
after mooney was picked up for questioning by new haven police 
his girlfriend led police on a search of the spot beneath the 
highway where he kept his belongings and slept 
in a cardboard box police found a 38inch belt matching the 
waist size of the victim in a duffel bag they found a pair of 
bloody trousers 
mooney failed in various motions to have the evidence 
suppressed and was convicted in march 1989 of felony murder and 
robbery 
mooneys appeal raises several questions what constitutes a 
home and how much privacy can the homeless expect 
i didnt feel homeless mooney said in a newspaper 
interview i felt at home i felt more at home than when i had an 
apartment 
robert m hayes an authority on the legal rights of the 
homeless said mooneys position is legally right he noted 
that a federal judge in new york ruled last year that for the 
purposes of voter registration a park bench could be considered a 
home 
but he added its a miserable wretched right to win it 
suggests a social acceptance of homelessness as a fact of life 
which should be resisted to the grave 
in opposing mooneys appeal assistant states attorney judith 
rossi argued that mooney was not legitimately residing at the 
bridge abutment as he himself realized 
the defendants decision to reside at the bridge abutment 
does not change either his status as an interloper or the public 
ie open nature of the land she said 
last year superior court judge joseph j purtill ruled that 
police had a perfect right to search mooneys makeshift home 
without a warrant 
i have serious questions as to whether or not the fourth 
amendment was ever intended to protect peoples rights in such a 
location he ruled 
but emanuel margolis the chairman of the connecticut civil 
liberties union and mooneys public defender said times have 
changed and the law must change as well 
this is not some isolated case of a trespasser who comes 
without permission upon a bridge abutment and says im going to 
be a squatter he argued before the state supreme court we 
have thousands and thousands of homeless in connecticut

the countrys political leaders 
reached an agreement saturday that clears the way for two 
opposition parties to end their fourmonth boycott of parliament 
the floor leaders of the governing party and the opposition held 
a joint news conference saying they had agreed to hold local 
assembly elections in the first half of next year mayoral and 
gubernatorial elections will be held a year later 
differences over the timing of the elections and the 
oppositions demand for greater local autonomy in communities were 
some of the key issues of the oppositions boycott 
the agreement obviously is not the best but it will ensure 
progress in our political system for which we made concession 
said rep kim hyungbae floor leader of the party for peace and 
democracy the largest opposition party 
this cleared all issues standing in the way of political 
normalization said rep kim yoonhwan of the governing 
democratic liberal party 
all 78 opposition legislators in the 299member assembly 
including 70 from peace and democracy and eight from the democratic 
party resigned in july they accused the governing party of 
railroading controversial bills and backsliding on political 
reforms 
the opposition set forth several preconditions to ending their 
boycott they included early local elections and cancellation of 
plans to change south koreas system of government from 
presidential to parliamentary 
korean president roh taewoo and other leaders had been seeking 
a parliamentary system similar to japans government wherein 
parliament would elect a prime minister to serve as a head of 
state 
the oppositions demand was met this month when a faction within 
rohs party rejected the change of government proposal roh then 
backed down and promised not to seek a constitutional revision

president carlos salinas de gortari has sent 
congress a police reform bill that could curtail torture and 
threats against prisoners in custody 
the proposed legislation was delivered by the president over the 
weekend it should pass easily since the congress is dominated by 
the governing institutional revolutionary party 
according to the government news agency notimex the reform 
would limit police search rights oblige police to obtain court 
warrants and stipulate that confessions be made openly before a 
judge or district attorney 
confessions to police or other law enforcement officers will not 
be valid under the proposed reform the purpose of this provision 
is to stop the widespread practice of eliciting confessions through 
threats and torture 
human rights groups have long complained that suspects are 
mistreated by police especially in drug or politicalrelated 
cases 
the legislation applies to federal law but each of the 31 
states and the federal district are expected to eventually include 
it in their codes of procedures 
the reform follows a shakeup in the attorney generals office 
javier coello trejo the powerful assistant attorney general in 
charge of drug enforcement was transferred in october to head a 
consumer protection agency his old job was downgraded and filled 
by an army colonel

president bush told a crowd that 
filled historic wenceslas square on saturday that america will 
stand with you through hard times ahead and he urged european 
solidarity in the persian gulf crisis 
visiting prague on the anniversary of the revolution that ended 
decades of communist rule in czechoslovakia bush also said new 
european security arrangements might be needed to make sure the 
former soviet allies do not wind up in some kind of no mans 
land 
in his speech bush likened last years struggle of emerging 
democracies against totalitarianism to the current usled effort 
to drive saddam hussein from kuwait 
the darkness in the desert sky cannot stand against the way of 
light bush said addressing about 100000 people who packed the 
halfmile long 200foot wide square that is the scene of much 
recent czechoslovak history 
the first us president ever to visit this central european 
nation bush shared the platform with playwrightpresident vaclav 
havel those in the crowd waved small us and czechoslovak flags 
and many chanted bush havel bush havel 
after their speeches the two presidents stepped out from their 
bulletproof enclosure and climbed a wooden platform and joined a 
folk band that sang we shall overcome first in english and 
then in czech 
many in the crowd joined along filling the cold and overcast 
late afternoon sky with the traditional song that was both a 
protest anthem for the us and civil rights movements of the 1960s 
and for czechoslovak students in street protests here against 
communist rule 
a year ago the square was similarly filled with hundreds of 
thousands of citizens to begin the socalled velvet revolution 
that drove communists from power with little bloodshed 
the world will never forget what happened here in this square 
where the history of freedom was written bush said 
he praised czechoslovakia as one of the first nations to 
condemn the outrage in the persian gulf 
havel reiterated this view and promised bush continued support 
during a joint news conference outside the hradcany castle the 
czechoslovak equivalent of the white house 
havel shrugged off a question on whether he was concerned that 
the persian gulf crisis was draining away money that could have 
been used to help support his countrys ailing economy 
it is my opinion that all the resources that are expended on 
resisting aggression anywhere in the world are finally turned to 
the good of all mankind he said 
bush was expected to try to further coordinate allied support in 
germany on sunday where he visits chancellor helmut kohl and in 
paris where he attends a threeday european summit 
at the news conference bush was asked if he and havel discussed 
future security arrangements for europe in the aftermath of the 
cold war and the crumbling of the warsaw pact 
we do not want to see czechoslovakia poland and hungary off 
in some kind of no mans land bush said thus we did discuss 
future security arrangements 
while he did not elaborate bush said he wanted to see a more 
active role played by the 34nation conference on security and 
cooperation in europe the group sponsoring the paris meeting 
future alignments in europe are expected to be high on the agenda 
of that session bush said the united states has an enormous 
stake in the security of eastern europe 
both in his wenceslas square speech and in an earlier address to 
the federal assembly the nations parliament bush offered hope of 
new us economic assistance to the fledgling democracy 
we know this is a difficult time for you but also a time of 
extraordinary optimism he told the crowd in the square winning 
loud applause america will not fail you in this decisive moment 
america will stand with you 
earlier he said final agreement was reached saturday granting 
czechoslovakia mostfavorednation trade status permitting it to 
deal with the united states at the lowest possible tariffs and 
import fee rates 
bush said he also would ask congress for 60 million to create a 
fund to spur us investment here moreover bush said funds to 
help build the private sector would be drawn from the 370 million 
already committed for central and eastern europe for the coming 
year 
the two leaders were wrapped in heavy topcoats against the 
biting wind in wenceslas square earlier bush and his wife barbara 
emerged from air force one to a fullfledged state welcome 
including a 21gun salute as flags of both nations snapped in the 
wind 
bush was to spend thanksgiving with us forces in the persian 
gulf region and then end his eightday trip next friday with a 
visit to egypt for talks on the showdown with iraq 
administration officials accompanying bush said the united 
states soon would ask moscow iraqs former chief arms supplier 
whether it had supplied mediumrange ss12 missiles to baghdad in 
the past 
such weapons could be capable of carrying chemical warheads 
moscow under a treaty with the united states was required to 
destroy these missiles 
we are going to the soviets on the matter because of recent 
reports on the possibility said an administration official who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
bush meets separately on tuesday in paris with soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev 
in his wenceslas square speech bush presented havel with a 
replica of the liberty bell that hangs in philadelphia to help 
you proclaim your new liberty throughout the world 
he also promised to take steps to return to the country a 
70yearold draft of a proposed czechoslovakia declaration of 
independence that is in the library of congress in washington the 
draft was presented to president woodrow wilson by tomas masaryk

president mikhail s gorbachev on saturday 
proposed dumping his embattled prime minister and giving himself 
more power to break a political deadlock and swiftly introduce an 
emergency food program 
losing popularity and power in his centrist position following a 
lackluster speech to the supreme soviet legislature friday 
gorbachev came out fighting saturday in a 12minute address packed 
with new proposals he urged lawmakers to approve a radical 
reorganization of the executive branch that would put it entirely 
under his control 
although representatives of several restive republics vowed not 
to cooperate with the new government the legislature voted 
overwhelmingly to give the program preliminary approval they voted 
31619 with 31 abstentions to send the proposals to committees to 
consider amendments and discuss a final draft friday 
gorbachevs suggestions appeared to be a concession to his main 
rival and critic russian president boris yeltsin who on friday 
had demanded a coalition government and the resignation of prime 
minister nikolai ryzhkov 
under gorbachevs proposals saturday the council of ministers 
headed by ryzhkov would be replaced by several bodies under direct 
presidential control the principal governing body would be the 
federation council created in march as a presidential advisory 
body but which would now be made the highest body of state power 
and include representatives of the soviet republics 
the proposals represent gorbachevs attempt to resolve the 
paralysis of power between the 15 republics and the central 
government that has blocked economic and political reforms for 
months 
he also proposed an interrepublican committee under the 
federation council a national security council and a presidential 
body to coordinate the activities of law enforcement agencies 
on the food crisis gorbachev promised emergency measures in two 
weeks for supplying this years produce to the population ryzhkov 
said this program involves increasing food imports a yeltsin 
suggestion 
apparently overwhelmed by his two jobs of president and 
communist party leader gorbachev also suggested naming a vice 
president 
it was the third time this year gorbachev asked soviet lawmakers 
to give him more power in march he received the powers of an 
executive president including the authority to impose direct 
presidential rule in restive areas in september he was empowered 
to issue decrees to make economic reforms and restore law and 
order 
a group of 235 former communist party members met saturday to 
form the republican party of russia which they said would be a 
leftcenter coalition supporting cooperation between gorbachev and 
yeltsin 
the nucleus of the party is members of democratic platform a 
popular faction of reformminded former communists who have 
included yeltsin and the reform mayors of moscow and leningrad 
gavriil popov and anatoly sobchak 
party leaders said the group had about 1000 supporters in 
moscow and small pockets in other russian cities it is strongest 
among the intelligentsia 
reacting to gorbachevs latest proposals some legislators said 
gorbachev was trying to grab too much authority 
it is concentrating all power in the economy in politics in 
military affairs in one persons hands marju lauristin deputy 
speaker of estonias parliament told reporters 
legislators generally welcomed the proposed elimination of 
ryzhkovs job but unless all the republics agree to join the 
federation council the paralysis of power is likely to continue 
many republics have nullified national legislation and 
presidential decrees and declared their laws supreme the new 
structure was designed to end such conflicts 
ms lauristin said estonia latvia and lithuania wanted no part 
of the new structure and georgian ukrainian and armenian 
representatives said they are not ready to sign a treaty binding 
their republics in a union 
the baltic states have said their incorporation into the soviet 
union in 1940 was illegal and invalid and have launched 
independence drives all but one of the other republics kirghizia 
have declared sovereignty to break from the kremlin 
the chairman of russias economic council mikhail bocharov 
called the proposals unrealistic because they do not give the 
republics full independence 
while acknowledging the powers of the republics and the central 
government must be redefined gorbachev reiterated in his speech 
his opposition to attempts to break up the union 
it is easier for me to say this now our own bitter experience 
tinged with the blood of our citizens has i think taught us that 
we cannot separate gorbachev said prompting applause 
after months of defending ryzhkov and claiming critics were 
making him a scapegoat gorbachev let ryzhkov go subtly he did not 
mention ryzhkovs name or specifically call for abolition of the 
council of ministers in his speech 
he referred only to creation of a new cabinet of ministers 
deputies said it was unclear whether the cabinet of ministers or 
the federation council would serve as a westernstyle presidential 
cabinet 
instead of abolishing the council of ministers and antagonizing 
bureaucrats gorbachev displayed his political skill by proposing 
their power be taken away in march he did the same thing to the 
communist partys ruling politburo giving many of its powers to an 
advisory body the presidential council 
on saturday gorbachev proposed abolishing the 18member 
presidential council and giving its functions to the strengthened 
federation council 
anything affecting the entire country whether decided by the 
center or republics must be discussed and given the goahead by 
the federation council he proposed 
ryzhkov a confidant of gorbachev for a decade said he believed 
he would be out of a job 
i understood that the position of chairman of the council of 
ministers wont exist there will be presidential rule a 
presidential cabinet the weary 61yearold prime minister told 
reporters 
yeltsin has seen ryzhkov and his associates as the embodiment of 
the old rulebycommand central bureaucracy reformers say the 
central bureaucracy is inefficient and corrupt and should be 
replaced with democratic free market institutions 
the federation council could be gorbachevs answer to yeltsins 
proposal friday of an extraordinary anticrisis committee with 
representatives of all republics and concentrating on providing 
food to the people 
yeltsin did not attend saturdays session and his press 
secretary said he would not comment immediately on gorbachevs 
proposals

ethnic turks 
also hundreds of women staged a hunger march late friday 
through the capital banging empty pots with spoons to protest bare 
stores and rations of basic goods including some foods 
electricity and gasoline 
lukanov whose socialist government is under growing pressure 
because of the balkan countrys economic crisis has been pushing 
for support in parliament for economic reforms 
the reforms would slash state spending but would bring more 
hardship for bulgarias already desperate consumers 
president zhelyu zhelev in a nationally televised address 
saturday warned that rising political tensions could lead to 
violence and appealed to groups and individuals to assume social 
and personal responsibility for their actions 
no act of force no violation of the law no provocation 
should occur that would compromise us in the eyes of europe and the 
world said zhelev who has been trying to rally western aid and 
support for bulgarias ailing economy 
zhelev a former opposition leader said he had asked leaders of 
all political parties to meet and try to resolve differences on 
wednesday when he and lukanov return from a 34nation summit in 
paris 
on saturday several thousand people gathered in front of the 
alexander nevsky cathedral in central sofia cheering as speakers 
urged support for all actions that will lead to the fall of the 
government 
the rally was organized by university teachers intellectuals 
and parents who support a student strike at most high schools and 
universities nationwide 
state radio reported the main opposition coalition the union of 
democratic forces organized antigovernment rallies in several 
other towns and cities 
lukanovs socialists formerly the communists won 211 
parliamentary seats in june elections compared to 144 for the 
union and formed a singleparty government after the opposition 
rejected a coalition but lukanovs popularity has slumped with the 
economys poor performance 
national leaders agreed friday to postpone a vote on lukanovs 
program in the 400seat grand national assembly until thursday 
deputies on thursday approved overwhelmingly an amendment to 
restore rights to bulgarias 15 million ethnic turks and moslems 
that sparked protests among bulgarians in turkishdominated 
regions 
under the amendment turks need no longer use bulgarian names 
imposed under the rule of former communist leader todor zhivkov 
thousands of bulgarian christians drove saturday to a greek 
border post and requested permanent residence to protest the

divers have found a sunken airplane 
and a body believed to be that of a man prosecutors suspected of 
faking his death to avoid a theft indictment and collect 4 million 
in insurance money authorities said 
the state attorney generals office has been looking for blan 
stewart a 47yearold insurance executive since halloween night 
1988 when his rented singleengine plane disappeared near lake 
martin in eastcentral alabama as he flew from vero beach fla to 
his hometown of huntsville in northern alabama divers combing lake 
martin found a piper archer aircraft at the bottom of the 
65footdeep lake friday morning and a body was floating in the 
cockpit said tallapoosa county sheriff joe smith 
smith said the body was wellpreserved apparently because of 
cold temperatures at the lake bottom 
fbi special agent gerald shockley said the planes registration 
number matched that of the plane stewart was flying when he was 
last seen 
forensic experts were waiting to examine stewarts dental 
records in montgomery where the body was being examined saturday 
attorneys for stewarts wife robin said clothes found on the body 
matched those stewart was wearing 
federal and state prosecutors have speculated that stewart faked 
a plane crash and his death to escape charges of insurance theft 
involving 590000 he collected but allegedly failed to pass on to 
insurance companies writing the policies 
in addition he faces firstdegree theft charges in lauderdale 
county where he is accused of passing a worthless check for nearly 
12000 to a furniture plant 
insurance companies have posted a 100000 reward for 
information on whether he is alive or dead 
in september the fbi obtained warrants charging him with 
unlawful flight after two people reported seeing him in the virgin 
islands in late november or early december 1989 
the fbi said telephone records subpoenaed by the state attorney 
generals office showed a collect call from the virgin islands to 
mrs stewarts home in huntsville in march the call came six weeks 
before she went to court to have her husband declared dead so she 
could collect on 4 million in life insurance 
a judge ruled however there was insufficient evidence to 
declare stewart dead he said stewarts heirs must wait seven years 
before he could be declared legally dead for insurance purposes 
officials at the state department of forensic sciences in 
montgomery declined to comment until the dental records had been 
examined 
an attorney for mrs stewart john heacock said several people 
who knew stewart arrived at the lake in time to see authorities 
remove the body from the muckcovered aircraft 
they had no doubt it was him heacock said 
the airplane was spotted by divers hired by mrs stewart who had 
been scouring the lake bottom since monday 
the plane was discovered in the same area where searchers had 
focused their efforts since stewarts aircraft vanished said tom 
radney another attorney representing mrs stewart 
this is in the area where our live witnesses said they heard 
the plane go down he said

prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki is 
trailing far behind solidarity leader lech walesa in polls for this 
months presidential election and he is in danger of being passed 
by a third candidate a new poll shows 
mazowiecki who had insisted on a gentlemanly campaign has 
begun sharper attacks on walesa saying his former ally in the 
anticommunist movement is promising more than he can possibly 
deliver 
the election is set for nov 25 if no one wins more than half 
the vote the top two votegetters will face each other in a runoff 
dec 9 
the state television polling service reported friday that walesa 
had the support of 35 percent of the voters to 19 percent for 
mazowiecki and 17 percent for stanislaw tyminski a polishcanadian 
businessman 
tyminskis fresh face and proven economic acumen are wooing 
voters the pollsters reported 
an additional 15 percent of the voters are undecided and the 
rest backed three other candidates 
although they fought sidebyside for a decade before the june 
1989 elections that brought solidarity to power walesa has 
lambasted mazowiecki as being a turtle so cautious that he 
couldnt catch a flea he said he had appointed mazowiecki to be 
a transitional prime minister 
mazowiecki who pledges to resign as prime minister the day 
walesa is sworn in as president fought back friday before a crowd 
of about 2000 students at gdansk polytechnic university in 
walesas hometown 
mazowiecki said he was running for president to protect his 
governments cautious but determined reform program 
the difference between himself and walesa mazowiecki said was 
that i will not promise that it will be done easily and 
overnight 
mr walesa makes promises that it will not be possible to 
realize he said 
the labor leader has offered to divide up polands stateowned 
enterprise and give each pole hundreds of dollars 
mazowiecki also suggested that walesa might undermine democracy 
by not observing a constitutional balance of powers 
in a modern democracy one person cannot stand higher than all 
the people he said

scientists have positively identified a skeleton 
exhumed from a new york cemetery as the remains of a haitian slave 
who is a candidate to become americas first black saint cardinal 
john oconnor said saturday 
a team of archaeologists forensic scientists and 
anthropologists determined that a skeleton dug up earlier this 
month was that of pierre toussaint the cardinal said 
the definitive identification was made of the bones all of 
them in order not a single one missing oconnor said at an 
archdiocesan conference on racial and ethnic issues this indeed 
is the skeleton of pierre toussaint 
toussaint was born in 1766 and brought to new york at age 21 by 
his french owners still enslaved he became a leading hairdresser 
in the city and was allowed to keep some of his income 
 
when toussaints owner died he left an impoverished widow and 
child in a typical act of generosity toussaint secretly supported 
them for 20 years the widow freed toussaint from slavery just 
before she died in 1807 
once free he bought the freedom of slaves and lavished money on 
charities including an orphanage and the citys first school for 
black children he also entered quarantined sections of the city to 
help yellow fever victims 
toussaint was buried at old st patricks church cemetery in the 
citys little italy section after his death in 1853 at age 87 
 
he is considered the founder of catholic charities because he 
helped the needy for 66 years when no formal systems of assistance 
existed 
for decades historians have been studying the life of 
toussaint whose last name means all saints 
 
the church began working to have toussaint considered for 
sainthood last december said church spokesman joe zwilling 
were interested in pierre toussaints holiness and what drove 
him to do things oconnor said 
the examination of his remains is a preliminary step during the 
period of investigation of his life the examination occurs before 
he is considered for beatification and is only an early step in a 
process that could take years toussaints remains will stay at old 
st patricks church until they are moved to st patricks 
cathedral where they will be kept with the remains of bishops and 
other holy people zwilling said 
it will be a wonderful thing for the city of new york if a 
canonization process ultimately takes place oconnor said it 
will restore some pride in the city it will be a great thing for 
the church it will be a fine thing for the black community 
digging for the remains began nov 1 but the first three 
skeletons unearthed were determined not to be toussaints

stormie jones the worlds first 
heartliver transplant recipient was eulogized saturday as a 
gallant courageous youngster who strived to live a normal life 
the 13yearold girl who battled organ rejection hepatitis and 
medical complications before her body suddenly rejected her 
transplanted heart last sunday was laid to rest in a cemetery in 
this suburb of fort worth 
at a 45minute funeral service many of the estimated 400 
mourners burst into laughter several times as jerry conley a 
minister at west freeway church of christ celebrated her life 
everything was always upbeat with this very special child 
conley said stormie has conquered life more gallantly perhaps 
than any person you or i have ever known her illness was not her 
enemy 
stormie was a very simple young lady he said she didnt 
really want all the fanfare that went with all of this she wantedto be 
just an average teenage girl 
she was later buried at a private ceremony attended only by her 
family and close friends 
at the church service white settlement mayor james herring read 
a resolution the city council approved earlier in the week 
recognizing stormie as an honored citizen 
she lived her life for others herring said she didnt 
desire the notoriety that came her way but she was willing to do 
her part as a result of that when called upon to step forward and 
talk to folks talk to the news cameras she was always there 
and ready and willing 
herring also read a poem one of stormies classmates wrote after 
her death 
most say you were just a little girl but you were an angel to 
me he read youve been our little lady your courage was so 
true when things seemed to go bad you always pulled through 
stormie died nov 10 at childrens hospital of pittsburgh 
where she underwent her historic operation on feb 14 1984 she 
had been rushed to the hospital from her home with a sore throat 
and fever 
doctors at the hospital said friday that stormie died because 
her body had suddenly rejected the transplanted heart the autopsy 
results surprised stormies doctors who said an organ rejection so 
many years after a transplant was rare 
no one expected to see any rejection in stormie said dr f 
jay fricker her cardiologist at childrens after all we had a 
track record of more than six years of never seeing any heart 
rejection so why would we suddenly see it now 
fricker said it would take months for doctors to determine if 
at all what caused the heart rejection 
doctors declined to speculate whether fk506 an experimental 
antirejection drug stormie began receiving last november a second 
liver transplant she underwent last february or treatment for 
recurring bouts of hepatitis caused the rejection 
the blond browneyed girl needed the heartliver transplant 
because of hypocholesteremia a rare genetic disorder that 
prevented her body from processing cholesterol her sister misty 
suffers from a milder form of the disease 
stormie had few major medical problems the first five years 
after her valentines day transplant but she had to return to 
pittsburgh in 1988 for surgery to remove a bile duct obstruction 
she underwent a mild episode of liver rejection in november 1989 
and began receiving the experimental fk506 instead of the 
traditional antirejection drug cyclosporine 
a bout with hepatitis in february slowly damaged her liver 
requiring a second liver transplant but clinical studies done 
after surgery showed no evidence of heart problems fricker said 
stormie began rejecting the second liver in may and was treated 
with an increased dosage of fk506 a month later she received 
medication for another bout of hepatitis 
recent flulike symptoms were the only indication something was 
wrong

backed by more than 1000 warplanes us and saudi troops 
prepared saturday for a mock invasion near the kuwaiti border a 
top iraqi general warned the usled force that his army has a 
surprise up its sleeve 
president bush was in czechoslovakia beginning an eightday 
trip that will take him to the saudi desert for thanksgiving with 
us troops his secretary of state james a baker iii also was 
in europe seeking support for a un resolution authorizing force 
against iraq 
bush in prague to commemorate the first anniversary of the 
countrys peaceful revolution referred to the persian gulf crisis 
in a speech to czechoslovak lawmakers 
you know from your own bitter experience that the world cannot 
turn a blind eye to aggression he said you know the futility 
and vain hope that aggressors can be appeased 
onethird of czechoslovakias territory was ceded in 1938 to the 
nazis in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent adolf hitler from 
conquering other countries 
in an essay written for the nov 26 issue of newsweek bush 
renewed his effort to rally americans behind his policies on the 
gulf crisis he wrote that the world must not reward aggression 
and said the united states cannot allow any tyrant to practice 
economic blackmail with oil 
imminent thunder as the current sixday exercises in the gulf 
are named is being supported by about 1100 aircraft the largest 
force of warplanes yet assembled for a desert shield exercise 
the drill is meant to emphasize gaining control of the skies 
which would be critical to smash iraqi defenses 
the first thing you want to do is establish air superiority 
said lt cmdr ron morse a us navy spokesman 
baghdad has called imminent thunder a provocative act 
because of its proximity to kuwait which iraq invaded aug 2 news 
reports have said part of the maneuvers could come within 10 miles 
of the kuwaiti border 
no live ammunition will be fired officials say 
the actual landing from amphibious landing craft and helicopters 
was set for sunday it was to involve 1000 troops from the 4th 
marine expeditionary battalion 
about 500 to 800 troops will hit the beach sunday according to 
pool reports based on briefings aboard the uss nassau the flagship 
for the amphibious landing commanders said a key objective is to 
practice an assault from ships 30 miles from shore 
in baghdad meanwhile an iraqi general said that the 
usdominated multinational force would face uncalculated 
developments should it attack iraq 
maj gen mundhir abdulrahman a missile expert and head of the 
iraqi armys morale department did not say what the surprise 
elements were but he said they would thwart an offensive his 
comments were published in alqadissiya the armys daily 
newspaper 
it was difficult to determine whether the general was speaking 
in his capacity as a specialist in longrange weaponry or as chief 
military morale booster 
in his article abdulrahman wrote the surprise element by 
iraq will make the american aggression face uncalculated 
developments and unexpected results in iraqs reaction which 
would make their execution of aggression impossible 
britains daily independent newspaper reported saturday that 
iraq is believed to have assembled three socalled superguns 
able to fire shells a distance of 465 miles 
us intelligence sources believe the guns largely assembled 
from britishmade components might have been deliverd to iraq 
before production of the weapons was discovered earlier this year 
abdulrahman said his country was prepared to defend itself 
despite plans to increase us troop strength us officials 
announced earlier this month that another 200000 us troops would 
join the 230000 americans already deployed in the region 
they face an estimated 430000 iraqi troops in southern iraq and 
kuwait 
in recent comments iraqi leader saddam hussein has indicated he 
still hopes for a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis and a 
soviet envoy yevgeny primakov has said he believes saddam is 
softening his stance 
still baker has been seeking support for a un resolution 
authorizing force against iraq if peaceful means fail he has 
argued that without such a resolution the alliance against iraq

president bush has asked former drug czar 
william bennett to take over lee atwaters job as chairman of the 
republican party in january and bennett has accepted gop sources 
said saturday 
bennett a former secretary of education in ronald reagans 
cabinet formally resigned nov 8 as head of the office of national 
drug control policy 
a gop source said atwater who managed bushs 1988 presidential 
campaign will continue to play a major strategy role for the gop 
possibly with a title as the partys general chairman 
such a structure would not be unique the source said citing 
frank j fahrenkopf jrs chairmanship of the republican national 
committee in the 1980s while thensen paul laxalt rnev held 
the title as the partys general chairman 
a formal announcement will not be made until bush returns from 
his eightday trip to czechoslovakia germany france egypt and 
the persian gulf said the source speaking on the condition of 
anonymity 
atwater 39 has been undergoing intensive treatment for cancer 
since a tumor was discovered on the right side of his brain last 
march his twoyear term as gop chairman expires in january 
bj cooper a republican party spokesman said that bennett 
is on a short list of people being considered to succeed 
atwater but theres been no formal announcement at this time 
cooper said bushs choice for a new republican chairman would 
have to be ratified by the partys national committee in january 
democratic national chairman ron brown meeting with his partys 
100000 donors in atlanta said he welcomes bennetts appointment 
as his chief adversary with open arms 
if bennett accomplishes as much for the republican party as he 
achieved at the education department and in ridding us of drugs and 
violence americans will have to begin worrying about the future of 
the twoparty system brown quipped 
atwater was more of a tactician than an ideologue after gop 
candidates lost to prochoice democrats in two highprofile 
governors races in 1989 he acted quickly to move the republican 
party away from its hardline opposition to abortion 
but he also had what democrats denounced as a pit bull style 
of politics citing his use of willie horton ads against 
democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis in 1988 
horton is a convicted murderer who raped a woman in maryland 
while on furlough from a massachusetts prison while dukakis was the 
states governor 
bennett 47 also has a reputation for confrontation and 
brashness two weeks ago when bush accepted his resignation 
bennett called rep charles rangel dny a frequent critic of 
his drug policies a gasbag

as british politicians calculate the pros and cons 
of life without margaret thatcher as prime minister six polls 
published sunday gave a new boost to the man who is trying to 
unseat her 
but mrs thatcher was reported sunday as saying she will not 
quit even if she wins the looming leadership battle in her 
conservative party by only a narrow margin 
if we win according to the rules we win and thats it the 
sunday telegraph reported her as saying in an interview mrs 
thatcher said she would not be swayed by the desires of senior 
party officials 
the rules were not made by me she said i abide by the 
rules i expect others to abide by the rules 
the newspaper polls showed voters believe mrs thatchers 
opponent for the party leadership former defense secretary michael 
heseltine has a better chance of leading the tories to victory at 
the next general election 
but the sunday express reported in its own poll of 332 of the 
372 tory legislators who will ultimately decide mrs thatchers 
fate that 162 said they would vote for mrs thatcher thirtyone 
said they would support heseltine while 27 said they did not know 
and 112 refused to answer 
at the midpoint of a sixday party campaign that could bring the 
end of mrs thatchers 11 years in power a headline in saturdays 
editions of the financial times reflected a new mood the spell 
is finall broken 
since heseltine announced his candidacy for conservative leader 
and prime minister wednesday some of mrs thatchers old friends 
have defected 
the sunday times endorsed heseltine over mrs thatcher saying 
voters were jaded with her and tired of her ways to an extent 
that has made her an electoral liability 
the times said its decision to go against mrs thatcher was a 
painful one but warned if the tories do not change their 
leader the voters are likely to change their government 
even some of her supporters have been lukewarm the economist 
magazine endorsed her but only after saying mrs thatcher 
truly a world figure no longer commands respect where it matters 
most for britain in the european community to her fellow ec 
leaders she has become a bore a ranter nothing more 
in the telegraph interview mrs thatcher said she might hold a 
referendum on the constitutional issues relating to britains role 
in europe an issue which has split her party and threatened her 
leadership 
the debate about how much sovereignty britain should yield to 
the european community is an explosive one for the conservative 
party mrs thatcher strongly opposes plans by the other 11 
community nations for a single currency and what she sees as a 
federal europe heseltine has argued for a less confrontational 
british approach in europe 
a market and opinion research international poll for the sunday 
times suggested the conservatives trailed labor by 11 percent with 
mrs thatcher as leader but jumped to one point ahead of the 
opposition under heseltine the pollsters interviewed 1059 voters 
friday 
a gallup poll of 1006 adults thursday and friday for the 
conservative telegraph indicated 63 percent of conservatives voters 
believed the party was most likely to win the next election under 
heseltine 
only 35 percent said the same of mrs thatcher who enjoyed less 
tory confidence than former deputy prime minister sir geoffrey 
howe with 38 percent 
sir geoffrey who resigned earlier this month helped prompt 
heseltines bid when he stood up in the house of commons and 
denounced mrs thatcher as a liabilty to britains vital interests 
in europe 
a poll for the sunday correspondent by the market research 
consultants icm research suggested the tories were 12 percent 
behind labor if mrs thatcher remains tory leader but her party 
vaulted to 8 percent ahead under heseltine the company interviewed 
947 voters friday 
similar results were published in polls for the liberal 
observer the mail on sunday and the independent on sunday 
foreign secretary douglas hurd ran well behind mrs thatcher and 
heseltine in most of the polls hurd discounted speculation he may 
stand in a second ballot saying mrs thatcher had his full 
backing 
no margin of error was given in the polls 
it is considered unlikely that heseltine who resigned from the 
cabinet in 1986 can win outright on tuesday but even mrs 
thatchers supporters are thinking aloud about what happens if that 
first ballot is inconclusive 
since nobody knows how the secret vote will go tuesday everyone 
can speculate among the possibilities 
mrs thatcher crushes heseltine on the first ballot and leads 
the party into the next general election which must be held by 
mid1992 
mrs thatcher wins but heseltine runs strongly eroding her 
authority as leader of the party and the government the 
nightmare scenario in the words of the prothatcher daily 
telegraph 
heseltine forces a second ballot opening the door for other 
candidates to step forward and putting mrs thatcher under great 
pressure to quit 
a second round of voting if necessary would be on nov 27 
with the possibility of a third round on nov 29

iraqi forces in kuwait have executed at least 
250 people arbitrarily detained thousands more and are 
systematically erasing all signs of kuwaiti culture a human rights 
group charged saturday 
about one month after the aug 2 invasion the iraqi government 
of president saddam hussein began a harsh crackdown in response to 
both armed resistance and peaceful demonstrations in the oilrich 
emirate the watchdog group middle east watch said in a report 
since then a systemic pattern has emerged of gross abuses 
the report said free expression has been muzzled and free 
assembly banned and violators are severely punished 
the author of the 18page report said that while conditions in 
kuwait were grim they were not as severe as some news reports have 
portrayed them 
there have been diplomats and other reports saying there were 
7000 summary executions aziz abu hamad said in an interview 
we only tracked down 250 such executions but it is still not a 
pretty picture and its getting worse 
the report tallied only those executions that took place after 
aug 5 three days after the invasion hamad said 
the availability of food and medical care is rapidly dwindling 
hamad said more than 5000 people have been arrested and of about 
3000 still in detention 14 percent are under 20 years he said 
the occupation has produced between 300000 and 400000 kuwaiti 
refugees but the report said that there is no iraqi policy to 
replace them with iraqis 
while individuals live in fear and hardship the invasion has 
also resulted in the slow erasure of kuwaiti culture the report 
said 
iraqi occupation authorities embarked on largescale 
systematic appropriation of the equipment furniture and archives 
of kuwaiti institutions including hospitals schools and 
museums the report said 
iraqi troops confiscated valuables from homes during searches 
and from those fleeing the country it said 
many kuwaitis are homeless and have little or no access to 
hospitals which have all been taken over by the iraqi military 
many medical personnal have been detained or killed the report 
claimed 
hamad a consultant to middle east watch said he met with more 
than 200 refugees who have recently fled kuwait and conducted 
about 70 interviews with people who were active in the community 
and had direct contact with iraqi forces 
middle east watch was formed in 1989 to monitor human rights 
abuses in the middle east 
the interviews took place in several cities in saudi arabia 
cairo and new york city during october and early november those 
interviewed included doctors hospital administrators civic 
leaders and academics as well as people who had been detained or 
have relatives who had been detained or killed 
they were people who couldnt take the conditions anymore the 
abuse the lack of food and fled hamad said 
maltreatment and torture of detainees has been widespread hamad 
said reports of sleep deprivation beatings with sticks and pipes 
and threats of killing other family members were common among 
former detainees he said 
in addition to crowded and unsanitary conditions detainees 
reported being severely beaten with clubs metal pipes and electric 
rods the report said 
mock executions were also reported it said some 
detainees were subjected to electric shocks that caused severe pain 
and bleeding from the mouth nose and ear

paramedics firefighters and even 
trained dogs got a taste of the big one as they pulled victims 
out of collapsed buildings and crushed cars saturday during 
indianas largest disaster drill ever 
state emergency officials called the earthquake drill a success 
saying they would now be better prepared for the real thing 
but they admitted no practice event could imitate the stress of 
a true catastrophe with real victims 
we can simulate almost everything but personal feelings 
said dave perkins operations director for the state emergency 
management agency we cant mimic the emotional stress 
the exercise attracted more attention than most annual diasaster 
drills because of a new mexico scientists disputed projection of a 
5050 chance for an early december quake along the new madrid 
fault said jerome hauer the agencys director 
the fault runs from marked tree ark north to cairo ill and 
affects parts of missouri arkansas tennessee illinois and 
kentucky 
earthquake experts have declared iben brownings projection 
meaningless but hauer said it has helped focus public attention on 
the possibility of a midwest earthquake 
during the drill which involved more than 200 people rescue 
workers were tested on their abilities to respond to the 
devastation that would be caused by an earthquake measuring 75 on 
the richter scale followed by two strong aftershocks 
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake 
as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph a magnitude 
of 6 or more can cause severe damage in populated areas 
the drill provided the states first test of an innovation for 
dealing with such disasters a small airplane flown by the civil 
air patrol videotaped the disaster scene and relayed pictures to a 
monitor at the vanderburgh county emergency management agency 
the drill was a bit too realistic for some volunteer 
victims 
at least three ivy tech students suffered symptoms of mild 
hypothermia after waiting in a chilly basement about four hours to 
be rescued an ambulance took one to a hospital where he was 
treated and released a hospital spokeswoman said

cleveland ohio television station the caller said he was among a 
group of americans hiding out in kuwait and said he supported 
military action against iraq

sometimes eating carryout pizza chicken spaghetti or just a 
bowl of rice hoffman said 
commanders would keep most of the money allotted for feeding 
hostages 
hostages whiled away the hours listening to the radio playing 
cards or exercising hoffman said 
their captors called them guests not out of belief but out of 
fear hoffman said even the doctors i saw would not admit that

years of confinement saturday for trying to kill his wife by 
hitting her with a toilet tank lid 
maj david schneider 35 also will forfeit all pay and 
allowances and be dismissed from the army 
he was sentenced by the same panel of eight officers that found 
him guilty friday of attempted murder and two counts of conduct 
unbecoming an officer involving perjury and adultery he had faced 
a maximum 26year sentence 
schneider a west point graduate will serve his sentence at the 
fort leavenworth disciplinary barracks he showed no emotion during 
sentencing

earlier this year in another case involving injury to his wife 
schneider was accused of flipping his wife deborah over a hotel 
balcony railing she fell eight floors and survived 
mrs schneider has since filed for divorce she has been unable 
to remember her fall and could not say whether her husband hit her 
with the toilet lid while she slept in october 1989 at their fort 
leavenworth home 
military prosecutors accused schneider of having an affair with 
a woman in california 
the affair made him want to kill his wife a military 
prosecutor capt richard okeefe jr said in closing arguments 
friday 
the defense rested its case thursday without calling schneider 
to testify in his own behalf both a pathologist and a crime lab 
examiner testifying for the defense said the toilet lid did not 
cause mrs schneiders wounds 
in the civilian case prosecutors had alleged that schneider 
threw his wife over a kansas city hotel railing last november a 
jury found him innocent after he testified that he was carrying his 
wife in a romantic gesture when she arched her back or fidgeted 
and he accidentally dropped her
