jan 30 that new york mets outfielder darryl strawberry was charged 
with assault with a deadly weapon after allegedly threatening his 
wife with a pistol 
strawberry was arrested jan 26 in connection with the alleged 
incident and spent a short time in jail before he was released on 
12000 bail 
los angeles police erroneously told the ap that felony charges 
had already been filed against strawberry 
the district attorneys office however did not review the case

in the days after hurricane hugo smashed 
into south carolina people needed ice food and clothing later 
they needed carpenters and building supplies 
now many coastal residents find they need a good lawyer 
in the wake of disputes over rental agreements insurance 
payments and building repairs south carolinas judicial system is 
bracing for an expected influx of cases stemming from the killer 
hurricane 
and with the courts already overburdened by a backlog of 
criminal cases there is concern that hugorelated cases will 
further bog down the system 
somebody is bound to not be happy out there said louis 
rosen director of the state office of court administration its 
one of those factors that will make a bad situation worse 
hugo which came ashore at charleston on sept 21 caused an 
estimated 59 billion in property damage making it the most 
damaging hurricane to hit the us mainland the storm was blamed 
for 29 deaths in south carolina alone 
were speculating that a storm with that extent of damage will 
raise construction disputes and insurance disputes said rosen 
whose office oversees the flow of litigation through the court 
system 
but the hugo cases will not really have an impact before summer 
he said 
you have to look a year after the fact rosen explained 
even after a person thinks he may be engaged in a legal dispute 
it takes some time to consult an attorney and look into it 
people with small claims will probably end up in magistrate 
courts which can handle cases involving amounts of less than 
2500 rosen said 
but bigger cases insurance settlements and contracting 
disputes will probably be more complicated and have to be settled 
in common pleas courts 
in the days after the storm the south carolina bar offered free 
legal advice at the disaster assistance centers established by the 
federal emergency management agency 
volunteer attorneys fielded thousands of calls and questions 
although there is no estimate on how many people received legal 
advice said eve stacey of the bar staff 
but the questions raised may give an indication of the types of 
lawsuits that may follow 
among the questions were concerns about landlordtenant 
relations damage caused by trees and structures from an adjoining 
property houses washed across property and insurance disputes over 
what was flood damage and what was wind damage 
i can see a lot of those as potential actions ms stacey 
said in a recent interview 
many disputes over what a tenant was liable to pay when his or 
her home was damaged in the storm have already been addressed in 
magistrate courts said donna taylor an attorney with neighborhood 
legal services in charleston 
they were handled at the magistrates level and were handled 
right then she said it was one of the times when the system 
operated well if we had to wait to go to circuit court people 
would have been homeless or penniless 
down the road she said the courts are going to be flooded 
with suits stemming from insurance claims the insurers failure 
to pay the extent of the policy 
there will also be a lot of lawsuits against contractors 
these young guys who came in from out of state and said i can fix 
your roof if you give me your two grand 
meanwhile the south carolina coastal council has been named in 
at least 12 lawsuits stemming from the hurricane all concern pools 
and seawalls in beachfront areas where the council has determined 
that structures may not be rebuilt council spokeswoman donna gress 
said 
a circuit judge ruled last week in eight of those cases that 
property owners may rebuild seawalls and pools but he required a 
10000 bond in case his decision is overturned by a higher court 
and the structures must be removed

newly disclosed documents offer an 
unflattering portrait of an official state segregation agency that 
spied on jewish children and investigated a black dentist at a 
white dentists request 
the 17year evolution of the mississippi sovereignty commission 
was chronicled sunday in the jackson clarionledger which obtained 
more than 700 sealed commission documents 
the activities of the spy agency created in 1956 to preserve 
mississippis segregated society previously had been part of the 
states secret past the files show that 
hundreds of people including teachers preachers and 
students were investigated for alleged civil rights leanings and 
subversive activities some lost their jobs 
dozens more including a prominent black delta educator who 
later had a school named for him were spies for the commission 
they helped gather incriminating information and infiltrated 
various organizations and groups 
us sen james o eastland turned over to the commission the 
names of some of his constituents who supported civil rights he 
also used his position as chairman of the senate judiciary 
committee to help the commission link tougaloo college president 
ad beittel and others to communism 
the clarionledger and jackson daily news regularly killed 
news stories or ran propaganda at the commissions request 
a black militant group was suspected of plotting to release a 
lethal gas in a jackson building the commission secretly aided the 
fbi in the case 
the commission in 1964 planted a story in mississippis 
largest black newspaper to publicize claims that the rev martin 
luther king jr was linked to the communist party 
holding the line between blacks and whites was the commissions 
goal when it was created by the 1956 legislature the commissions 
influence withered during the 1960s and gov bill waller 
eliminated its funding in 1973 
the 1977 legislature abolished the commission and ordered its 
files sealed until 2027 to protect those named in the documents 
a us district court case that would open the files is on 
appeal to the 5th us circuit court of appeals in new orleans 
the clarionledger did not say how it obtained the files 
executive editor john d johnson said monday that the newspaper 
would not disclose the source of the documents 
commission files at one time contained the names of 250 
organizations and 10000 people according to a document in the 
files however not all were considered leftist or subversive 
the documents say 
in december 1960 the commission spied on 300 jewish teenagers 
attending a fivestate bnai brith youth meeting at a motel in 
biloxi 
these youths sang songs and a general party atmosphere 
prevailed a commission investigator wrote we observed them 
and listened to them but we could observe nothing or hear nothing 
that indicated that they were advocating subversion integration or 
anything of a communistic nature 
in 1969 the commission investigated presley autry a black 
holly springs dentist who was seeking admission to the mississippi 
dental association the investigation was conducted at the request 
of a white greenwood dentist arthur richter according to the 
files 
richter said he had received unconfirmed reports that autry 
participated in civil rights activities and believed he wasnt a 
desirable candidate for the dental association a commission memo 
says 
the investigation uncovered nothing to support the unconfirmed 
reports richter was given the result and asked to hold it in 
strict confidence 
i felt that the interest of a matter of this nature to the 
public would give us the authority to check it out although it 
would not come under the category of a taxsupported matter a 
commission director wrote 
autry 61 who retired in 1986 and lives in houston said he was 
admitted to the association without any problem richter recently 
said he didnt remember much about the case 
a january 1964 report contains some insight into the 
commissions philosophy in it state sen george yarbrough asked 
commission investigator tom scarbrough about integrating the holly 
springs public library both men have since died 
scarbrough wrote i told sen yarbrough at the time that it 
was my thinking that when the city board made concessions to a 
group of negroes other demands would follow from the same group 
and as far as i was personally concerned i felt that we should 
hold fast our way of life until forced to retreat

a federal appeals court on monday ruled 
unconstitutional an order barring the television program inside 
edition from broadcasting scenes filmed with a hidden camera in a 
doctors office 
judge boyce f martin jr of the 6th us circuit court of 
appeals ordered us district judge barbara k hackett of detroit 
to lift her jan 18 restraining order which had prevented the 
syndicated program from using the film shot in the new york office 
of dr stuart m berger 
martin ruled that ms hacketts order violated the 
constitutional guarantee of press freedom despite bergers argument 
before hackett that showing the tape would invade his privacy and 
damage his reputation 
berger simply has not shown the type of irreparable harm that 
can justify a prior restraint martins order said 
inside edition spokeswoman marcy baron said the program 
plans to include the scenes shot in bergers office in a segment 
about him which is to be shown thursday 
bergers attorney russell ethridge filed a request that martin 
delay his order to give the doctors attorneys time to appeal the 
ruling to the us supreme court 
once that footage is broadcast the images cannot be recalled 
and the damage cannot be undone ethridge said in his request 
were disappointed that the court didnt see the distinction 
we see between defamation cases and invasion of privacy 
ethridge said by telephone from detroit 
he said bergers attorneys plan to press his claim for 10 
million in damages from the show 
inside edition producer amy wasserstrom said in an affidavit 
that she videotaped two visits she made as a patient to bergers 
office while preparing a story on controversy surrounding the 
doctors medical conduct berger is the author of several widely 
sold diet books 
ms wasserstrom said berger diagnosed her as suffering from an 
allergy to yeast and chronic fatigue however another doctor said 
she didnt have such ailments 
we believe that the reporter did nothing wrong said russell 
smith an attorney for king world productions inc which produces 
inside edition 
she told him of her condition truthfully and he misdiagnosed 
her ripped her off and caused her stress smith said if 
there was any misconduct here it was by dr berger

most of the 190 paintings willed to the 
spanish state by surrealist artist salvador dali are to remain in 
his native catalonia under a newly signed agreement that ends a 
year of bickering 
dalis will was made public shortly before his jan 23 1989 
death at age 84 but it was not until monday that agreement was 
reached on where the works he willed to the state will be put on 
display 
culture minister jorge semprun and catalonian culture 
commissioner joan guitart signed the pact 
under its terms the reina sofia art center in madrid is to 
display the great masturbator considered one of the flamboyant 
painters greatest works and reportedly one of the last sticking 
points of the talks 
another 55 paintings are also to be on display in the reina 
sofia art center and the remaining 134 are to be kept in the 
building housing dalis theatermuseum in figueras where he lived 
his last years confined to a wheelchair 
in addition to the 190 paintings the moustachioed artists 
estate includes two castles 500 sculptures and other dalidesigned 
objects and hundreds of signed prints 
government officials in catalonia and figueras had complained 
publicly after dalis death when they found they were not 
specifically named as beneficiaries in the will 
press reports at the time of dalis death said his estate was 
worth up to 901 million but its real value is difficult to 
determine because of the erratic prices of 20th century art and the 
existence of numerous forgeries

president fw de klerk has 
ignited hope that the white government is finally ready to 
dismantle apartheid and sit down with black leaders to find a 
solution to south africas problems 
but there is little sign that de klerk is about to surrender 
power or that white rule is in any danger of collapsing even though 
the presidents stated aim is to end apartheid there are still no 
signs that the government will accept full democracy the main 
demand of all antiapartheid groups 
de klerk is expected to outline his plans in a speech friday at 
the opening of parliament many south africans are hoping the 
speech will be the signal for historic reform despite official 
warnings not to expect too much 
some political observers say the quest for peace in south africa 
is more like the confrontations in northern ireland or the middle 
east there is little chance they say that white rule will come 
crashing down overnight like the berlin wall and the communist 
regimes of eastern europe 
the government is in full control of the country unrest is 
minimal and the african national congress the main black 
opposition group admits its military campaign against the 
government poses little threat at this point 
de klerk who says he wants a new dispensation that will 
give south african blacks a role in the countrys affairs still 
rejects any suggestion of majority rule 
there also are few signs that many white south africans are 
ready to share their schools hospitals and other public facilities 
with nonwhites or share power and opportunity on an equal basis 
with nonwhites 
many observers say de klerk lacks a definite plan and is feeling 
his way playing for time with limited reforms in the hope of 
finding a solution that will avoid major confrontation and still 
preserve a special role for whites 
de klerk has given no specific signs of what he wants for south 
africas future beyond stressing that whites must have veto power 
in any future state 
black leaders say de klerk must meet a number of basic 
expectations to clear the way for talks with the african national 
congress including lifting the state of emergency releasing anc 
leader nelson mandela removing the ban on the anc and other 
outlawed opposition groups and allowing exiled black leaders to 
return to south africa 
how far he goes towards meeting these conditions friday will be 
a good indication of how much reform the government wants even if 
de klerk meets all the conditions it will only be the start of 
what promises to be a very long and difficult search for peace 
skeptics point out that de klerk as leader of the national party 
is head of south africas afrikaners whites of dutch descent who 
dominate the government and who have been sustained by a belief in 
their superiority for three centuries 
because of deeply ingrained beliefs of white superiority and 
rule neither de klerk nor his people can give up power and accept 
equality with the blacks asians and others they have dominated for 
so long these observers say 
that leaves the question of what de klerk and the government 
hope to achieve through a more moderate stance and why they have 
begun to remove parts of the apartheid system 
the government has contained but not removed black opposition 
by using the security forces and harsh restrictions de klerk 
apparently wants to defuse the racial confrontation with political 
means rather than face what he warned would be 80 years of war 
a more pressing problem is the ailing economy buffeted by 
sanctions imposed by western nations because of apartheid and poor 
management inflation is soaring and many white south africans find 
it harder to make ends meet 
the government hopes to ease the economic crunch by offering 
reforms to ease international sanctions and restore confidence in 
the economy with new foreign investment 
there are also signs that the government hopes a more moderate 
stance and reforms would encourage some opposition groups to take a 
softer line this could lead to a compromise with some opposition 
groups and isolate or weaken hardline groups 
but the first question de klerk must answer is whether he has 
the time and the backing of his white supporters to achieve the 
compromise he says he wants

exotic kashmir a tourist paradise of 
houseboat hotels and mogul gardens from whose name the english made 
cashmere has become a war zone of separatism and religious 
enmity 
military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil 
servants around srinagar in these dangerous days as soldiers and 
paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by moslem 
separatists in the kashmir valley 
intelligence officer mk kaul commands one of the jeeps at the 
beginning of a trip through the city of 1 million people he turned 
to the four soldiers in the jeeps rear seats and ordered check 
your weapons be ready to fire 
kaul settled into the front seat a 9mm pistol in his right 
hand these are bad days he murmured these diehard 
terrorists can attack from anywhere 
to his men he said shoot them if you see them 
on monday an aroundtheclock curfew was lifted from 5 am 
until noon and stores opened to crowds of customers soldiers in 
sandbagged bunkers armed with light machine guns guarded main 
intersections 
a spokesman for the jammukashmir state government said the 
situation was peaceful and absolutely normal in srinagar the 
states largest city 
at least 72 people have been killed since the crackdown began 
jan 20 in an effort to curb attacks on government officials and 
buildings most of the dead have been moslem militants shot by 
indian troops 
we are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any 
popular movement said jagmohan governor of jammukashmir the 
only state in predominantly hindu india with a moslem majority 
we are fighting a handful of terrorists who are determined to 
create a law and order problem said jagmohan a hindu with a 
reputation for toughness 
other officials in kashmir say privately the situation is 
critical perhaps the most serious threat india has faced in 42 
years of independence from britain 
it looks like everyone here has turned into a fundamentalist 
with firm belief that the day is not far off when they will become 
independent a state police officer said 
kashmir was a separate kingdom ruled by a hindu maharajah when 
britain relinquished colonial rule on aug 15 1947 and the 
subcontinent was partitioned on religious lines into india and 
pakistan 
the hindu king opted to join india not pakistan and the 
dispute over kashmir has exacerbated relations since 
pakistan took the western part of kashmir and india the eastern 
each accused the other of forcible occupation 
they have fought wars over kashmir and the border question 
remains unresolved un observers are stationed on the truce line 
and the two sides occasionally trade gunfire 
officials will not say how many reinforcements have been sent to 
the kashmir valley since jan 20 but reports from various sources 
indicate 30000and 40000 soldiers and paramilitary troops have 
been deployed 
it is the valleys heavily moslem population that tilts the 
sectarian scale in jammukashmir state 
of the states nearly 6 million people 64 percent are moslems 
and 32 percent hindus most hindus live in the southern jammu area 
srinagar has 150 mosques this is the best breeding ground for 
moslem fundamentalism said a federal official who helps 
coordinate the new security measures 
nearly every mosque has a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to 
prayer and more recently to exhort listeners to defend their 
faith and kashmir 
the residents are constantly bombarded with islamic sermons 
and are reminded that fighting a jihad islamic holy war is the 
most sacred duty of every moslem the federal official said on 
condition of anonymity 
electricity was cut off in the city friday which was both the 
moslem sabbath and indias national republic day on indias 
republic day but many mosque loudspeakers continued operating 
because militants connected them to car batteries 
intelligence reports suggest the government has an advantage 
because the separatists are not united 
the most powerful group is the jammukashmir liberation front 
but there are several others including the allah tigers 
hezbemujahed hezbeislami 
india claims the fundamentalists get money and weapons from 
pakistan the pakistanis deny it 
jagmohan the governor insists the main issue in kashmir is 
economic development not separatism 
the people do not want violence or the socalled independent 
kashmir he said the need of the hour is development let more 
tourists come let new schools be built let new hospitals come 
up 
as he spoke military officers waited in the next room to 
discuss a new strategy to crush rebellion in what the tourist 
brochures call paradise 
right now paradise looks lost at least temporarily

mcdonalds imported seeds taught soviet potato 
farmers how to increase their yields built its own food factory 
spent 50 million and waited 14 years before selling a single 
burger in moscow 
george cohon chairman of mcdonalds of canada doesnt have any 
idea if or when hell recapture his investment after the opening of 
the first franchise in the soviet union on wednesday 
i just know im going to take those rubles and build another 
restaurant he said 
the restaurant located near pushkin square is the biggest 
mcdonalds in the world and is designed to serve 1250 people an 
hour 
unlike other foreign ventures the restaurant will sell its food 
for rubles so that ordinary soviets not just privileged 
foreigners can eat there a second mcdonalds out of a planned 
20 will sell for hard currency to foreigners 
anybody who thinks it was easy to get this far need only glance 
at the abandoned storefront a few miles away its pizza hut 
sign mocking pepsicos proud announcement that it would open a 
restaurant in moscow in 1988 
the depth of mcdonalds investment in the soviet market can be 
measured not only in currency but in the lengths it went to ensure 
a reliable soviet food supply 
agronomists brought in seeds and taught soviet collective 
farmers whove planted potatoes for years that they could improve 
their yields 20 to 100 percent using modern methods cohon said 
to avoid losing 25 percent or more of the harvest to spoilage 
mcdonalds taught farmers how to pick potatoes gently and store 
them properly purchasing manager vladimir boras said the company 
developed its facilities near moscow because it couldnt build a 
new transportation network 
a few weeks ago boras knelt in the black earth of a greenhouse 
on the outskirts of the capital and examined the green budding 
heads of iceberg lettuce used in a big mac above 400watt bulbs 
blazed along the rows making up for the short days and cloudy 
skies of midwinter moscow 
the electric bill was 8300 in december said vladimir 
goloveshkin of the dzerzhinsky farm but boras wasnt sure the 
lettuce would be ready for the grand opening 
hed tried an experimental crop of lettuce months earlier at a 
different collective farm he said but when he arrived to examine 
it the farmers had eaten the entire harvest 
they said it was delicious boras recalled 
not all supplies are sovietmade the warehouse is brimming with 
imports including paper cups napkins bags spices and secret 
ingredients such as mcdonalds crust improver 
up to now gorbachevs economic reforms have had little effect 
on soviet consumers who complain bitterly of empty store shelves 
and the ridiculously high prices charged in private markets but 
the new climate opened the way for mcdonalds to form a partnership 
with the moscow city council and to contract with collective farms 
now permitted to sell onethird of their fruits and vegetables on 
the open market rather than to the state 
cohon said meat is still distributed by allocation and it took 
the intervention of the mayor to obtain beef for the fastfood 
restaurant 
even so carcasses must be handselected because the local 
slaughterhouse wont guarantee mcdonalds the meat from the animals 
it taught farmers how to raise boras said 
mcdonalds also benefited from other foreign investors a 
chicago company built a model dairy to promote its milking 
equipment and mcdonalds buys its milk there to avoid the high 
bacteria counts common in soviet milk 
but the company built its own water purification system machine 
shop and laundry 
for all that some of the sovietsourced items on the firms 
list turn out to be apples from bulgaria with the help of moscow 
officials mcdonalds bought them for rubles after the government 
imported them 
its a big country said terry williams a quality assurance 
manager who is one of only three nonsoviets among 150 employees at 
the food plant theres a distinct possibility well find a 
soviet source next year

ordinary wheelonrail railroads get the back 
of the hand treatment in a budget proposed by president bush that 
looks forward instead to trains floating down the track through 
magnetic levitation in bushs budget trees make out like bandits 
too so do robots 
in every presidential budget proposal there are winners and 
losers but congress often reverses their order by the time it has 
worked its will usually after august 
this years loser candidates are familiar targets owners of 
boats riders of trains buses and subways children from affluent 
homes eating subsidized school lunches those kids would be 
required under bushs budget to pay the full cost of lunch 
adding about 29 cents per meal to their outlay 
president reagan tried to trim their subsidies too congress 
balked now bush has taken up the call 
in an even more pragmatic attack on the deficit bush proposes 
to make it harder to get away with cheating on taxes he wants to 
close the gap between taxes owed and taxes paid 
toward that end his budget seeks more money for enforcement of 
the tax laws specifically for collecting delinquent taxes 
checking out fake dependent claims auditing mortgage interest 
deductions and matching what the taxpayer says he received in 
interest against what interest payers say they paid 
in other timeworn economy proposals bush asks congress to make 
recreational and commercial boat owners pay a 25 fee to quit 
subsidizing amtrak a step that could jeopardize longdistance rail 
travel and to end big city mass transit subsidies that help pay 
for daytoday operations municipal taxpayers should shoulder that 
burden says bush 
the federal governments responsibility is not to run the 
railroads explained richard darman the presidents budget 
director 
the presidents budget however is intrigued with more 
futuristic transportation like magnetic levitation a new 
transportation technology that relies on the use of magnets for 
propulsion and levitation rather than conventional 
steelwheelonrail technology bush proposed spending 97 
million to check it out 
along the same lines the president calls for spending 192 
million on robots intelligent machine systems that do physical 
work 
most robots today work in structured environments or under close 
human supervision the budget notes so federal research should 
focus on building more autonomous robots capable of 
interacting with a changing and uncertain environment 
meantime in a sharp break with predecessor ronald reagan who 
said in his 1980 campaign for the white house that trees cause 
pollution bush embraced trees his budget proposed planting a 
billion of them a year on private land into the indefinite future 
he called for initiating a community plant a tree initiative 
that would line the streets of america with 30 million more trees 
in most cities he said only one tree is planted for every four 
removed 
the president said more trees would fight the threat of global 
warming combat the pollution of streams prevent soil erosion and 
save energy 
dense evergreens closely placed around a house can cut fuel 
bills by 20 percent the president said and an acre of woodland is 
capable of removing as much as nine tons of carbon dioxide from the 
air 
even though 3 million acres of trees a year are planted in the 
united states more are lost total woodlands decline by 700000 
acres a year the budget says

president bushs budget is as cautious as the 
man it is a document that offers a little bit here takes a little 
bit there but gives his congressional critics few safe targets for 
their outrage 
those who demand deeper cuts from the pentagon may feel uneasy 
fighting to save the 55 domestic military bases bush wants to close 
its a budget tailored to the political image the president 
fosters 
readers of his budget can watch the environmental president 
plant a billion trees and the education president bolster funds for 
head start still determined to cut capital gains taxes bush also 
offers a plan to encourage longterm savings 
ronald reagan sent congress red meat budgets abolish the small 
business administration cut food stamps and sell the profitable 
chunk of amtrak demanded reagan in nocompromise budgets intended 
to implement his conservative agenda 
reagans goals were clear big increases for the pentagon sharp 
cuts for domestic programs 
not so the bush budget it is a product of a different world as 
well as a different president a cold war pronounced dead a berlin 
wall crumbled a communist threat to themselves maybe 
the new budget reflects the bush who yearns to travel a middle 
road rather than the macho president of the panama invasion 
his budget message was barely 10 paragraphs in length one page 
of a volume running nearly 1600 a dry cover letter introducing 
budget director richard g darmans far more quotable essay that 
talks of green eyeshades the cookie monster and the 
hidden pacmen of federal budgets 
its left to darman to deal with the sticky question of the 
deficit 
unfortunately wrote the budget director a meaningful 
answer to the question how big is the deficit is not quite as 
simple as the question 
as for the peace dividend people think might follow the end of 
the cold war and the crumbling of the berlin wall darman warned 
there is a new game premised on the assumption of a substantial 
nearterm peace dividend it starts by overestimating the dividend 
then each player plans to spend the dividend in his or her 
preferred way 
but bush did not ignore such expectations his budget offered a 
2 percent cut in defense after inflation the price for holding 
down the pentagon budget was closing 55 bases many of which were 
in democratic districts 
defense secretary dick cheney called the proposed closings a 
real test for congress if nothing else the defense proposal 
enabled the administration to get out front in the race to sound 
willing to cut pentagon spending 
there are bigger targets out there like the five b2 stealth 
bombers at a total cost of 55 billion or the proposal for a 900 
million increase in funding for the strategic defense initiative 
the spacebased missile defense system dubbed star wars 
predictably democrats grumbled when the budget reached the 
capitol 
its another fraud cried sen ernest f hollings dsc 
who has a fondness for strong rhetoric 
but no one was shouting dead on arrival the congressional 
rallying cry of the reagan budget years when many republicans 
joined democrats in rejecting the presidents priorities 
more characteristic of the criticism of the bush budget was 
house majority leader richard gephardts complaint i think its 
a standpat budget said the missouri democrat i dont think 
its a budget that really meets our needs

president bush wants to give the us space 
program the largest budget increase for any major government 
agency saying no value can be calculated for the benefits of 
space exploration 
in the budget he sent to capitol hill on monday the president 
proposed giving the national aeronautics and space administration 
an authorization of 151 billion in the fiscal year that begins 
oct 1 an increase of 28 billion nearly 24 percent over this 
year 
no price can be put on the lifting of the spirit of people 
everywhere like that which occurred at the time of the apollo 
landings on the moon bush said no value can be calculated for 
the wonder engendered by the pictures of jupiter saturn uranus 
and in august of 1989 of neptune sent back over millions of miles 
by voyager 
in actual outlays for the 1991 fiscal year nasa would receive a 
175 percent increase to 141 billion the space agencys spending 
authority differs from the oneyear budget because spending 
authority includes money for projects that wouldnt be completed 
and paid for until later years 
bush also was generous to nonspace fields of scientific 
research adding 895 million for basic nondefense research for a 
total of 109 billion plus a 21 billion increase for applied 
research and development for a total 144 billion 
among the areas proposed for a boost was the national science 
foundation getting 22 billion a 13 percent increase aids 
research increasing by 749 million to 32 billion and the 
superconducting super collider receiving 293 million a 56 
percent increase 
the presidents request to congress demonstrates the 
administrations continued strong support for nasa and the civil 
space station nasa administrator richard h truly told a news 
conference 
the manned space station which the united states hopes to have 
in orbit late in the decade would be the major beneficiary of an 
increase from 17 billion to 24 billion as the project moves 
from design to the fabrication stage the first construction flight 
is scheduled for spring 1995 
if approved by congress the space budget would pay for starting 
the mission to planet earth an ambitious program to study the 
earths environment using satellites and instruments 
the budget request includes 661 million in spending authority 
to study the earth including money to start two polarorbiting 
platforms the first of which would be launched in 1998 it also 
would initiate the development of earth probes a series of smaller 
instruments focused on specific highpriority data needs 
including ozone depletion the first would be launched in 1994 
last july on the 20th anniversary of the first moon landing 
the president set a goal of having the united states return to the 
moon and then begin manned exploration of mars early in the 21st 
century 
the budget request reflects the first steps toward that goal in 
a 179 million authority item for exploration technology which 
includes 45 million for lunar and mars science and 11 million to 
study the possibility of using nuclear propulsion for longdistance 
travel in the solar system 
bushs proposal also envisions development of two new robotic 
missions the lunar observer and lifesat the latter would be a 
series of reusable satellites designed to carry living specimens 
into orbit and be returned to earth for analysis of the effects of 
longterm exposure 
the national aerospace plane a joint nasa and air force 
project would receive a total 277 million in spending authority 
an additional 129 million in joint funds is proposed for 
developing a new family of launch vehicles

a fuel shortage like the one avianca flight 52 
had before it crashed probably would not be taken seriously by air 
controllers unless the pilot actually declared a fuel 
emergency controllers and aviation experts say 
under rules and standards set by the federal aviation 
administration if a pilot tells air traffic controllers he has 
minimum fuel both he and controllers know that no undue delay 
can be accepted 
but the faas air traffic control manual says this is not an 
emergency situation but merely an advisory that indicates an 
emergency situation is possible should any undue delay occur 
a minimum fuel advisory does not call for the aircraft to get a 
traffic priority under the faa rules but if the pilot declares a 
fuel emergency the entire controller system is geared to come to 
his aid 
the faa manual puts it this way 
common sense and good judgment will determine the extent of 
assistance to be given in minimum fuel situations if at any time 
the remaining usable fuel supply suggests the need for traffic 
priority to ensure a safe landing the pilot should declare an 
emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes 
investigators probing the crash of the avianca flight which 
killed 73 people and injured 85 said monday that regional 
controllers relayed information from the flight to the control 
center for kennedy international airport 
the regional controller said avianca 52 had just come out of the 
holding area and can only do five more minutes of hold can you 
take him now 
the local control replied slow him to 180 knots and i will 
take him 
records indicated the boeing 707 had more than enough fuel to 
fly from colombia to new york but the jet flew in holding patterns 
for nearly 90 minutes because of weatherrelated congestion before 
it crashed 
on sunday lee dickinson of the national transportation safety 
board told a news conference in melville ny there was an 
apparent communications gap between highaltitude regional 
controllers and those handling landings 
as the plane neared the end of its final 46minute holding 
pattern south of the airport the crew told controllers in the 
regional new york center about the fuel shortage and requested 
priority clearance to land dickinson said 
dickinson said that after interviewing six local controllers who 
either handled or tracked the flight investigators at first 
determined they were unaware of the shortage dickinson said 
r steve bell president of the national air traffic controllers 
association aflcio called the safety boards assertions highly 
misleading and premature 
the avianca pilot never declared a fuel emergency he noted 
tragically the pilot only said that he was low on fuel which is 
a very commonplace occurrence in bad weather and holding 
this information would not necessarily have been transmitted 
when one pilot hands off to another he said 
no one knew how perilous was his situation until it was far 
too late bell said the air traffic controllers would have 
moved heaven and earth to make for a safe approach for the crippled 
aircraft but the pilot never sent out the key words that he was in 
mortal danger 
fred farrar a spokesman for the federal aviation agency said 
it is not the responsibility of the controllers to relay 
information other than the flights route and number unless the 
pilot specifically calls an emergency 
air traffic controllers have one primary job to keep 
aircraft from getting too close farrar said its the 
captains job to fly the airplane its not the controllers job to 
make judgments for him

soviet ambassador yuri v dubinin says soviet 
troops and security units are in azerbaijan to stop ethnic 
bloodshed and not to suppress political dissent 
dubinins statement monday appeared to put him at odds with 
dmitri yazov the soviet defense minister but the ambassador to 
the united states insisted all soviet officials were in agreement 
on why force was used in the strifetorn republic 
the situation was characterized by an orgy of killings and 
pogroms violations of elementary law and order and armed ethnic 
clashes on a large scale dubinin told reporters at the soviet 
embassy 
referring to the emergency decree signed by president mikhail s 
gorbachev two weeks ago dubinin said the only objective was to 
stop the bloodshed and to restore peace 
his account appeared at odds with that of yazov who was quoted 
last friday as telling a group of soviet journalists in baku the 
regional capital the military intervention was designed to prevent 
a nationalist mass movement from seizing power from the communist 
party 
state department spokesman richard boucher said monday that 
certainly we found those comments disturbing especially if they 
represent accurately soviet policy 
but dubinin said yazov had spoken only about measures taken 
against armed activities of the azerbaijan liberation front 
i would like to point out that the political position the 
political line the political approach of all the soviet 
leadership of all government bodies of the soviet union is 
unified dubinin said 
the only political line is that which was done by the decision 
of the presidium of the supreme soviet and the line i have just 
taken the ambassador added 
dubinin said gorbachev and the presidium of the soviet 
parliament were compelled to dispatch troops and kgb units to 
azerbaijan because the situation was becoming really very 
dramatic despite vigorous efforts by the soviet leadership over 
two years to arrange a political settlement to the ethnic tensions 
between azeris and armenians 
dubinin said military force was used to protect the 
constitutions of the azerbaijan and armenian republics in the midst 
of international strife 
the introduction of troops was necessitated not by some 
political objectives related to suppressing dissent he said 
the only objective pursued by these measures was to stop the 
bloodshed and restore peace and enter a sense of security to 
people dubinin said 
he said the situation in azerbaijan remained difficult with 
trains that would carry food and fuel to armenia under an blockade 
schools in armenia have been forced to shut down factories are 
idle and homes are without electricity at night

the bush administrations unwillingness to be 
more specific about a proposed 15 billion cut in farm commodity 
programs in fiscal 1991 doesnt sit well with sen patrick leahy 
dvt 
in bushs budget proposals sent to congress on monday farm 
commodity programs were projected to cost nearly 104 billion in 
the fiscal year that begins oct 1 
but white house budget planners said outlays for the agriculture 
departments commodity programs would be even higher if congress 
failed to go along with 15 billion in farm program cuts to be 
worked out later with lawmakers 
although no one was specific about how the 15 billion might be 
carved out of the departments commodity credit corp spending 
budget for 1991 the options include further reductions in price 
support and target price benefits the ingredients to determine how 
much direct crop subsidies might be due to farmers 
leahy chairman of the senate agriculture committee told a 
group of bankers that the budget plan suggests they will continue 
to cut target prices and price support loan rates until the farm 
programs are effectively abolished 
in a statement later leahy added that as congress begins debate 
on the 1990 farm bill farmers deserve straight answers on the 
administrations farm policy he said the administration talks 
in generalities and refuses to specify where the cuts will come 
from 
for its part the administration said in its budget report that 
the white house is prepared to work closely with the congress 
to develop marketoriented farm legislation that allows producers 
to decide what crops to grow while also achieving the budget 
savings needed in the commodity programs 
the document cited a number of options for reducing ccc outlays 
by the 15 billion including an extension or acceleration of 
the downward slide in target prices and loan rates authorized in 
the 1985 law 
savings also could be achieved by reducing the number of acres 
eligible for payments or targeting benefits to smaller farmers in 
greatest need the budget report said 
rep kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house 
agriculture committee said in a statement that efforts to 
balance the federal budget cannot be allowed to destroy one of our 
greatest accomplishments which is to provide safety net levels 
of support for farmers 
bush also pledged monday that the administration will work with 
congress to prevent some individual farm operations to collect 
excessively large federal subsidies 
failure to do so will result in a loss of public confidence 
and support for the farm program said the budget report the 
taxpayers rightly expect these abuses to be curbed 
the 1985 farm law limits the amount of incomesupport payments 
under various crop programs to 50000 per person each year the 
limit on total federal subsidies is 250000 per year for each 
person 
but these ceilings have been routinely exceeded because a 
person is defined as an individual or business entity such as 
a corporation or trust the budget document said 
the report included diagrams of how illegal joint ventures using 
family members and other entities were set up to evade the 50000 
limit in 1988 and collect 912089 in federal subsidies another 
example showed payments of 801619 
both examples were included last year in reports by the 
agriculture departments inspector general 
the budget document also said that while reducing farm program 
costs is important the administration also is concerned about 
the distribution of those subsidy payments 
a significant portion of benefits goes to larger wealthy 
farmers it said in an era of limited resources this is hard 
to justify 
in 1987 for example 30 percent of the 224 billion in 
commodity related subsidies went to 4 percent of the farmers who 
had average net cash incomes of more than 100000 per year and net 
worths of nearly 850000 
this should be changed congress was told one option for 
achieving savings of approximately onehalf billion dollars would 
be to eliminate direct payments to farm operators with adjusted 
gross incomes of over 100000 per year 
the budget document added this income level after all 
represents three times the average for an american family of four 
up to a billion dollars could be saved by withholding direct 
payments to farm entities with gross sales of 500000 per year or 
more

environmentalists are applauding president 
bushs budget emphasis on repairing damage caused by construction 
of dams and other federal water projects 
the president said he wanted to be known as the environmental 
president david campbell an economist with the wildlife 
federation said monday this actually is a fairly good start 
weve been arguing for years that both the corps of engineers 
and the bureau of reclamation have overdue mitigation he said 
we should be redirecting these agency budgets from all this 
harmful construction into something more environmentally 
beneficial 
the 32 billion for the 1991 fiscal year for the army corps of 
engineers about the same as sought last year designates several 
million dollars for environmental repairs and continues funding for 
construction projects under way but offers no money for new 
projects 
the civil works program and budget reflect the new emphasis 
placed by the administration on maintaining and restoring the 
environment the corps said in its explanation of the budget 
major provisions addressing environmental concerns are 
16 million for construction of juvenile fish passage 
facilities on the columbia and snake rivers in washington oregon 
and idaho 
20 million to begin acquisition of 88000 acres to mitigate 
environmental losses caused by construction of the 
tennesseetombigbee waterway project in alabama and mississippi 
13 million to plan repairs to the environment damaged by 
construction of richard b russell lake in south carolina and 
georgia and areas of iowa nebraska kansas and missouri after 
navigational improvements were made on the missouri river 
campbell noted congress gave the administration authority in 
1986 to seek federal funds for the next five years to buy private 
land around the tennesseetombigbee waterway for environmental 
restoration but the administration didnt act until this years 
budget the last year of the authorization 
campbell estimated 20 million should be enough to acquire about 
47000 acres this year 
the fisheries on the columbia river also are desperately needed 
to restore salmon to the waterway which campbell called decimated 
by the dambuilders who started building on the river in 1935 
the president has asked for 1039 billion including 616 
million in construction outlays for the bureau of reclamation an 
agency within the interior department that assists in the 
construction of irrigation reservoirs in the arid west 
the proposal calls for a halt to federal spending on the 
garrison diversion unit in north dakota which was authorized by 
congress in 1965 to provide water to the eastern section of the 
state through canals and rivers 
the presidents budget calls garrison is an uneconomic and 
environmentally destructive project which would require in excess 
of 1 billion to complete 
no major new construction starts are proposed however dam 
safety work and environmental damage mitigation at existing 
projects and most water projects already in construction would 
receive continued funding

the real estate agent dubbed robin hud 
pleaded guilty to stealing at least 475 million from the federal 
housing program and then said she is optimistic even if her future 
includes prison 
im prepared to accept what comes my way i have no fear 
said marilyn louise harrell who entered her plea monday in us 
district court a lot of my friends and former employees are 
exoffenders and theyre fine people 
harrell 46 of the southern maryland town of waldorf had said 
she gave much of the money she had stolen from the department of 
housing and urban development to charity 
i really truthfully consider it an honor to give up years of 
my life to help some of the people ive helped she said 
but us attorney breckinridge willcox said that by april 20 
when harrell is set to be sentenced my assertion that she has 
been her own biggest charity will be fact 
in addition to stealing government property harrell pleaded 
guilty to lying on her tax returns and to federal officials 
harrell said she pleaded guilty because she did not want to 
spend taxpayers money on a trial 
prosecutors dropped two other tax counts two counts of lying to 
hud officials and one count of lying to a bank on a loan 
application 
im very pleased harrell said that was a very gracious 
move to offer me what they offered 
she could be sentenced to a maximum 13 years in prison and fined 
500000 
prosecutors recommended a sentence ranging from 37 months to 46 
months in prison they also plan to recommend a fine but no amount 
has been set 
harrell confessed to government officials in december 1988 and 
became a symbol of mismanagement at hud under the reagan 
administration when scandal erupted there last summer after her 
indictment in november us attorney dick thornburgh called it the 
largest theft of federal funds by an individual 
i thought id get caught a long time ago harrell said after 
mondays us district court hearing im sorry for what i did i 
figured i was history and would help as many as i could before i 
went down 
prosecutors say harrell stole from hud at least 66 million 
money generated by sales of hud properties that harrell handled as 
a private escrow agent for the agency 
harrell said she has documents to prove that she took only 475 
million and that less than 6 percent of the money benefited her 
family 
prosecutors previously said she had taken at least 56 million 
but revised the figure after identifying six more properties for 
which she allegedly did not remit settlement proceeds 
harrell said she has prepared herself for prison since 1985 
when she started diverting hud funds she told her family she would 
use the prison time to get a college education 
harrell appeared relaxed at the hearing before us district 
judge herbert f murray 
when murray asked how she felt harrell replied terrific 
your honor 
supporters who said they had benefited from harrells largesse 
attended the hearing one held up a giant card decorated with 
balloons reading marilyn were remembering you 
charlotte chepaitis who said she runs a baltimore homeless 
shelter said harrell helped the shelter financially but declined 
to give details jesus said to do your alms in secret and thats 
just what sister marilyn did chepaitis said 
and like jesus said she cried out today for forgiveness now 
there are millions praying for her

president bushs proposed 1991 budget lops a 
few billion dollars from defense spending in acknowledgement of the 
cold wars demise but a peace dividend or windfall for social 
programs is practically too small to fight over officials say 
the spending plan sent to congress on monday seeks total 
military spending of 3033 billion thats about 2 percent or 
31 billion less than this years pentagon budget after 
inflation 
the administration is shying away from talk of a peace 
dividend for fear that congressional budget axes will land too 
hard on the pentagon but the 31 billion figure is the likely 
starting point for debate over defense savings some private 
analysts advocate cutting defense spending in half over the coming 
decade 
democrats already accuse the administration of protecting the 
massive pentagon budget even as political change in the eastern 
bloc makes war increasingly unlikely 
it is a rip van winkle budget that has not yet awakened to the 
changes in the world or the major challenges at home sen edward 
kennedy dmass said monday 
in an essay accompanying bushs spending blueprint for the year 
starting oct 1 budget director richard darman made it clear the 
administration sees no sense in clamoring for a sudden shift in 
spending priorities 
the issue has been framed as how big is the peace dividend 
and in effect how can i get mine darman wrote his 
suggested answers are not big enough to matter yet and dont 
conclude youll get yours any time soon 
darman argues that in order to ensure that democracy takes hold 
in the east bloc the united states should stick to the peace 
through strength formula of high defense spending that bush 
contends helped defeat the communist regimes 
congressional leaders already have made it clear they will try 
to take a bigger chunk out of the defense budget but the debate 
over how to use any savings is less clear cut 
should it be used to reduce the federal deficit or can it make 
room for a tax cut should it go to education or housing programs 
what about repairing the bridges tunnels and roadways across the 
country that are crumbling of old age 
although he does not link any proposed spending increases to a 
scaling back of the defense budget bushs 1991 budget adds 500 
million of spending authority to the head start preschool 
education program for a total of 19 billion he also seeks more 
money for urban enterprise zones designed to encourage selfhelp in 
the inner cities and boosts spending to combat drug abuse 
other proposed increases in domestic spending include an extra 
642 million for cleaning up hazardous wastes at facilities run by 
several federal agencies and 175 million to kick off a 
reforestation program aimed at planting 1 billion trees 
some argue that far from realizing a peace dividend the 
american people are as likely to see more tax money going to pay 
for the governments mistakes of the past one example cited by 
darman is the cost of cleaning up the millions of gallons of 
radioactive and toxic wastes that have been building up virtually 
in secret at energy department nuclear weapons plants over the past 
40 years 
darman puts that cost at 140 billion to 200 billion over the 
next 30 years 
and even as the energy department seeks increased financing for 
the cleanup work it remains committed to expensive projects to 
modernize the nuclear arms factories bushs budget calls for about 
a 6 percent increase after inflation in key weapons production 
activities plus a 19 percent jump in spending authority for 
development of a new generation of reactors to make weapons 
materials 
energy secretary james d watkins said that while spending on 
weapons factories might eventually be reduced no savings should be 
expected until more ussoviet arms control agreements are 
completed and eastwest relations grow friendlier 
far better to press on and show the will to do what is now on 
the table then back off later he told reporters we recognize 
that thats more expensive but let me tell you its the only way 
for this to pay off its a peace through strength issue

president bush who wants to hold the overall 
federal budget to a 3 percent increase is seeking a 20 million 
14 percent increase to run his own office 
the president in the budget sent to congress on monday wants 
to spend 500000 to renovate the white house kitchens and 45 
million for a new white house computer system 
the overall budget for the executive office of the president 
would surge by 84 percent from 174 million to 319 million in the 
1991 fiscal year but most of that increase is for the expanded war 
on drugs 
leaving aside the budget for the office of national drug policy 
the us trade representatives and several others listed under the 
white house the executive budget actually would climb to 158 
million from 138 million spokesman stephen hart said 
bushs salary stays frozen at 200000 but the budget includes 
an 8 percent increase for staff assistance and support from just 
less than 30 million to 325 million 
bush who has also said he wants to be known as an environmental 
president also wants to nearly double spending on the council on 
environmental quality from 14 million to 27 million or 87 
percent 
he also provided a 19 percent increase for the national security 
council from 48 million to 58 million and the national space 
council would get an 82 percent boost to 12 million from 688000 
for the care and upkeep of the white house itself bush 
envisions spending 79 million next year an 183 percent jump 
from the current 66 million spending level the figure includes 
500000 for the rehabilitation of the white house kitchens 
last years budget had 800000 to replace exterior windows of the 
executive mansion 
by law bushs own salary is fixed at 200000 plus a 50000 
entertainment budget 
bush also requested 25 million for his new points of light 
initiative foundation a governmentbacked nonprofit group that 
will seek to spur community service and volunteerism around 
america bush will be honorary chairman 
the cost of maintaining the vice presidents home cars staff 
and other services would jump from 470000 to 609000 a 30 
percent increase that includes a 15000 raise in his official 
entertainment budget to 90000 
bushs council of economic advisers chaired by michael boskin 
would get a 65 percent increase to 3 million

patients in operating rooms around the 
world are asking whats up doc 
from vermont to australia doctors and nurses are tossing aside 
traditionally bland scrub uniforms and donning ones adorned with 
bugs bunny tweety and baby dinosaurs 
the designer is dr j christian abajian director of pediatric 
anesthesiology at the medical center hospital of vermont abajian 
and his wife margaret run huggable scrubs inc which customizes 
the pajamalike hospital outfits 
abajian 46 said he developed the idea for patterned scrubs in 
1986 as a way to ease the tension felt by hospitalized children 
who often will not pay attention to hospital staff because they are 
scared 
we did it just to make my job easier just to relate to 
children easier said abajian clad in a dinosaurdotted scrub in 
one of the hospitals operating rooms 
the first pattern a jungle inhabited by tigers giraffes and 
frogs was sewn by his wife and was an immediate success he said 
there just wasnt any doubt right from day one that it was a 
hit he said there really never was any doubt in my mind that 
it would help me with a child but i never anticipated the response 
i get from adults 
abajian said one time a man waiting in the delivery room told 
him before i saw you wearing that shirt i was about to lose it 
i saw you and i just felt so much more relaxed 
mrs abajian began sewing scrubs for her husbands colleagues 
dr richard hubbell an ear nose and throat surgeon clad in 
scrubs showing bugs bunny as a circus ringmaster said the 
clothing helps him relate to his young patients 
it helps to ease their mind through a very stressful 
situation hubbell said the children love them 
when the demand started increasing as the word spread abajian 
decided to launch huggable scrubs inc 
the abajians then began the directmail company from their 
northern vermont home in williston with mrs abajian doing the 
sewing 
after several unsuccessful ventures with investors and 
manufacturers huggable scrubs inc is finally getting off the 
ground the company now has a business manager and is having its 
garments produced by the hedma corp in nearby north troy 
in 1988 the company had sales of about 20000 that figure 
jumped to about 74000 in 1989 
huggable scrubs needs to approach 150000 in sales this year to 
stay in business the abajians said 
the company processes about 35 orders a week destinations 
include australia belize canada colombia france and about 300 
hospitals in the united states 
perhaps the biggest break for the company has been their 
twoyear licensing agreement with warner bros for the use of 
looney tunes cartoon characters including bugs bunny the abajians 
hope bugs who is celebrating his 50th anniversary this year will 
help them make money 
michelle greenberg an account executive with lca entertainment 
a subsidiary of warner bros said the company views this project 
with more than just an eye on the bottom line 
it doesnt really matter to us whether we make money on 
this greenberg said hes bringing happiness to a lot of 
people thats what his license is all about its good will

theres something fishy about the 
fullpage ads taken out by a wood products giant to promote a 
takeover attempt involving 21 million acres in northern maine 
the newspaper advertisements show a smiling sportsman with a big 
fish theres just one little problem theres no such fish in 
northern maine 
georgiapacific corp has been running the ad in maine 
newspapers for weeks to drum up support in its battle to buy great 
northern nekoosa corp for 38 billion 
biologists say the fish in the ad appears to be a striped bass 
which lives in coastal waters and not in northern maine the 
location of the land at stake in the takeover 
the advertisement is headlined the maine facts about 
georgiapacific 
gail smith a spokeswoman at georgiapacifics atlanta 
headquarters said she had little information about the picture 
it was taken somewhere in new england ms smith said 
its intended to be a representation of sporting activities 
the striped bass has been introduced in some freshwater bodies 
particularly in the south and the state is trying to develop a 
population in the kennebec river 
fisheries biologist paul johnson said monday the fish probably 
will never swim in the waters of great northerns land 
were a long way from the coast he said they should just 
change that picture in their advertisement

the pentagons plan to close or scale back 72 us military 
installations has riled officials in large cities and small towns 
targeted communities nationwide are mobilizing to fight like the 
dickens to avoid the cuts 
california would be the hardest hit under defense secretary dick 
cheneys proposal with 10 bases employing more than 35000 
servicemen and 22000 civilian workers slated for closure or 
reductions 
but the closings also would hit hard in communities such as 
charlestown ind a southern indiana town of 5700 where the 
defense department plans to mothball a munitions plant and lay off 
about 900 workers 
its the only place a lot of the people have worked said 
mayor bob braswell who once worked as a security guard at the 
indiana army ammunitions plant theyve worked there all their 
lives 
in announcing his 2921 billion fiscal 1991 spending plan 
monday cheney called for congress to have the guts to make 
tough decisions about closing military bases 
the response in affected communities came quickly 
pennsylvanias two republican us senators john heinz and 
arlen specter showed up outside the philadelphia naval shipyard 
pledging to fight the recommendation that the yard be closed 
the philadelphia navy yard is a winner said sen john 
heinz and we are going to keep it a winner anybody who is going 
to try to make it a loser will find out they are wrong 
some lawmakers accused the republican administration of 
targeting military installations in democratic districts 
rep glen browder dala sounded a battle cry to save fort 
mcclellan which officials said if closed would cost the anniston 
area in eastern alabama 2700 military positions and 1500 civilian 
jobs 
if they are looking for a political fight theyve come to the 
right place were ready said the freshman congressman who 
defeated republican john rice last year in a special election to 
replace the late bill nichols 
california would bear the largest share of the cuts 
one of the bases that would be closed is the alameda naval air 
station which has 8300 servicemen and employs 5100 civilians for 
a combined annual payroll of 340 million in the island city of 
77000 in the san francisco bay area 
this is really a terrible thing to hear and were not going 
to lay back and let it happen said mayor chuck corica 
were going to fight like the dickens to keep this base open 
the largest possible closure in california would be fort ord 
near monterey and the long beach naval shipyard 
fort ord is home of the armys 7th light infantry division 
which helped invade panama last month the base has 15000 soldiers 
and 3000 civilian employees with a combined payroll of 732 
million and an estimated impact on the local economy of more than 
885 million a year 
the shipyard in long beach one of the port citys largest 
employers could take up to 100 million a year out of the local 
economy said long beach area chamber of commerce president bob 
creighton 
naturally we oppose it naturally well do whatever we can 
to make sure that it doesnt become reality said assistant city 
manager john shirey 
officials in some states announced plans to try to find 
nonmilitary uses for bases slated for closure 
states that have been moving away from reliance on defense 
spending said the strategy has enabled them to cope with budget 
reductions 
in connecticut officials said the defense industry has dropped 
from 12 percent of the states gross product in 1982 to 6 percent 
in 1988 with united technologies leading the switch the hartford 
company has trimmed its defense operations from 75 percent 12 years 
ago to just about 25 percent today 
that kind of strategy will be more and more important over the 
next few years said stephen b heintz connecticuts economic 
development commissioner 
some workers took the announced closings in stride 
tom ferkler a union steward at the philadelphia naval shipyard 
said employees have heard several proposals during the past decade 
to close the shipyard 
its the hottest topic and naturally everyones concerned 
but when it gets down to the workingmans level the decisions not 
in our hands

a us plan to close or move troops from 14 
military bases abroad had some south koreans worried today and 
british communities fretted over the prospect of losing millions of 
dollars in local spending 
however the soviet union said the proposed us defense budget 
which calls for a 2 percent overall spending cut is in keeping 
with american and soviet commitments that are bringing the cold war 
to an end 
and despite local concern in communities near bases british and 
other european governments generally reacted calmly to the plan on 
monday 
south korean newspapers gave banner headlines in todays 
editions to the us plan to close three air force bases in that 
country where security is the no 1 national priority 
reassuring nervous south koreans the countrys defense ministry 
said the combined war capability of the us and south korean 
forces would be little affected by the plan 
brig gen jimmy l cash vice commander of the 7th us air 
force based in south korea said in a statement today these 
changes do not signal a lessening in the united states 
commitment to the republic of korea 
the 11500 us air force personnel in the country are among 
43000 american troops in south korea under a mutual defense pact 
to guard against aggression from the communist north 
the changes at the us bases abroad would be made under a plan 
proposed in washington on monday by defense secretary dick cheney 
he also wants to make similar moves at about 55 military bases in 
the united states 
the overseas bases targeted for closing are the nea makri naval 
communications station in greece and these air forces bases comiso 
air base italy erhac air base and eskisehir munitions storage 
site both in turkey hellenikon air base greece kwang ju air 
base suwon air base taegu air base all in south korea raf 
fairford raf greenham common and raf wethersfield all in 
britain and zweibrucken air base in west germany 
the us navy would make force reductions at bermuda naval air 
station and change the makeup of forces at san miguel naval 
communications station in the philippines 
the british defense ministry additionally announced monday that 
a squadron of us f16 fighters based at bentwaters in eastern 
england is to be disbanded 
ruth ritter the mayor of fairford said i am very sorry 
about this decision because it is going to cause a great deal of 
uncertainty in our community particularly for the 300 british 
civilian workers at the base 
the fairford base has 18 kc135 airtoair refueling tankers 
charles daybell chief executive of braintree district council 
in eastern england which includes the wethersfield base said 
we are very sad at the thought of losing so many good friends 
the base spends nearly 6 million pounds a year in the area 
roughly 10 million 
the wethersfield base houses a civil engineering unit with 531 
us servicemen 
lt col sam giammo director of public affairs for the 3rd us 
air force based at mildenhall in eastern england said about 3000 
us personnel will be withdrawn from britain or about 75 percent 
of the total 
soviet foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev commenting on 
the proposed us defense budget said both the us and the 
ussr have agreed the cold war is over any vestige of that 
should be relegated to history 
in italy pio mastrobuoni a spokesman for prime minister giulio 
andreotti said the announcement is a sign of the times the 
news expresses the new reality of the climate of cooperation 
between east and west 
prime minister margaret thatcher of britain a firm opponent of 
any significant disarmament by the west despite crumbling communist 
control in the east bloc had no objections said a spokeswoman 
at her office 
foreign secretary douglas hurd of britain said during an 
official visit to washington that the us plan was entirely 
compatible with the united states commitment to nato 
at greenham common cruise missile base west of london where 
women antinuclear protesters have camped outside for nearly a 
decade protester evelyn parker said its stunning news this 
has been an amazing thing to live through 
missiles are being removed from greenham and other bases under 
the 1987 agreement between the superpowers to eliminate their 
mediumrange nuclear missiles

gov l douglas wilder a democrat once 
known as one of virginias most liberal legislators has been 
talking and acting like a conservative since he took office jan 13 
in his first two weeks as governor wilder called for spending 
cuts to create a budget surplus supported expansion of the death 
penalty and consulted with republican legislators before he 
presented the state budget 
the fiscally conservative approach wilder has taken even has 
some republicans saying he is acting more like one of them than a 
democrat 
some people have suggested that wilder the nations first 
elected black governor is already looking beyond virginia politics 
i think hes perhaps using state politics as a vehicle for 
some future run for national office said mark rozell a 
political scientist at mary washington college in fredericksburg 
he is taking a very cautious approach on many issues 
the national democratic party needs a fiscally conservative 
southerner who can hold traditional democratic constituency 
groups said larry sabato a political analyst at the university 
of virginia 
what doug wilder is fundamentally is a politician he is not a 
black politician the creed of every politician is there go the 
people let me run in front of them he said 
but sabato said wilders liberal roots can be seen in some ways 
such as in the record number of blacks he has appointed to high 
state offices 
wilder has remained mum about his ambitions asked whether he 
would pledge to serve out his fouryear term he replied with a 
smile i can assure you that it is my intention 
wilder has questioned past solutions to social problems which 
he said stemmed from bad attitudes he said he would use his 
example as a leader to fight drugs illegitimacy and poor school 
performance among segments of the black populace instead of 
simply throwing money at them 
wilder a former criminal defense attorney who once opposed the 
death penalty said it should be extended to cover those who kill 
during drug deals those slayings account for about a third of the 
homicides in richmond alone 
i do think society has a right to express its outrage at 
heinous crimes wilder said i dont know that it would be any 
deterrent 
wilders major step so far has been his plan to create a 224 
million surplus in the 199092 state budget which already has been 
squeezed by a projected revenue shortfall that could approach 1 
billion 
the governor also proposed slashing recommended teacher pay 
increases and raising liquor prices in staterun stores to create 
the surplus 
i was shocked by the proposal on the teacher pay raises 
said steve haner director of the republican legislative caucus 
thats a political group he owes his own existence to 
haner said republicans have found little to complain about in 
wilders first weeks 
sometimes we wonder whether or not we won the election he 
said

the fbi would be forced to cut 400 agents from 
its workforce in its 1991 budget largely because of a new overtime 
law that is expected to add 42 million to the bureau payroll 
the 400 agents will be eliminated as a result of attrition said 
deputy director floyd clarke who noted that there are between 450 
and 480 retirements or resignations each year there are more than 
10000 fbi agents 
right now our hiring program will have to be almost stopped 
in 1991 if the proposed budget stands clarke told reporters 
monday at a briefing on the justice departments budget 
we just have to work harder he said we will get the job 
done 
the loss of 400 agents from the fbis payroll contrasts with 
planned increases in drug enforcement administration agents to 
fight president bushs stepped up war on illegal drugs the 
proposed budget would increase the number of dea agents from 3167 
to 3547 in the next fiscal year dea officials said 
there is no question the drug war is receiving a very high 
priority said deputy attorney general donald b ayer it is 
the highest priority in the department 
the cut in the fbis agent workforce would be only the second in 
a decade the 1981 fiscal year budget cut 93 agents 
the proposed 154 billion fbi budget would increase 
expenditures by 100 million from the current budget of 14 
billion 
proposed increases for more agents for such highpriority 
activities as whitecollar and organizedcrime investigations 
partially offset the acrosstheboard manpower cuts 
but even the whitecollar crime section will suffer a net loss 
of 41 agents under the proposed budget there would also be a net 
loss of six agents assigned to organizedcrime cases 
those decreases would be implemented despite attorney general 
dick thornburghs repeated vow to fight crime in the suites 
those priorities remain the attorney generals priorities 
said justice department spokesman david runkel but the fbis job 
is to manage the operation within the budget provided them 
in the coming months the justice department will work with the 
fbi to ensure that in the implementation of a final budget there 
will be no diminution of effort in the priority areas identified by 
the president and the attorney general runkel said 
runkel suggested the bureau could better manage the time of 
agents to reduce the overtime budget virtually every fbi agent 
earns overtime officials said 
the fbi will eliminate 227 agents at a savings of 257 million 
to meet deficitreduction targets officials said 
the bureau also plans to cut 559 agents to finance the higher 
cost of overtime under a new law enacted by congress the overtime 
formula for paying federal law enforcement agents is expected to 
cost the fbi 419 million in the 1991 fiscal year according to 
justice department budget documents 
the increases for highpriority programs will add 388 agents 
resulting in a net loss of 400 agents according to budget 
documents 
the new law pegs overtime pay to an agents actual pay grade 
previously all agents over grade 10 earned overtime calculated to 
that pay level 
senior agents will earn between 13000 and 15000 in overtime 
each year instead of 6000 to 7000 runkel said 
the justice department expects to spend 66 million in 
additional overtime for fbi immigration and naturalization service 
and dea agents in the 1991 fiscal year 
the office of management and budget had originally agreed to add 
that money to the departments budget said one department source 
however omb later decided to force the justice department to 
absorb the extra overtime expenses said the source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity

portauprince haiti ap the military government lifted a 
state of siege and ended press restrictions after a 10day 
crackdown on the democratic opposition but newly exiled activists 
called the gesture meaningless 
state television announcing the end of the measures on monday 
night said they had produced their full effect and permitted the 
settlement of the crisis which threatened the future of haitian 
democracy 
three government critics banished during the crackdown said the 
true threat to establishing democracy on this impoverished 
caribbean island is the military leadership they said the free 
elections lt gen prosper avril has promised for october remain an 
impossiblity under the circumstances 
the state of siege was declared jan 20 to put an end to 
subversive machinations president avril told the nation on 
saturday the government had also suspended articles of the 
constitution that prohibited the forced exile of political 
opponents 
on jan 22 the government banned television and radio news 
broadcasting that it had not authorized those restrictions were 
lifted on monday 
avril said saturday that the state of siege would be lifted 
today in view of the positive results already obtained 
more than 50 opposition politicians and militants were have been 
arrested in the crackdown most said they were beaten before being 
released at least four were reported missing or still in custody 
human rights activist robert duval and political leaders sylvio 
claude and gerard phillipeauguste went into hiding 
dr louis roy called the father of the constitution in 
haiti conservative politician hubert de ronceray communist party 
secondincommand max bourjolly prominent businessman and civic 
leader antoine izmery and three other opposition militants were 
sent into exile 
in miami on monday night robert leger a spokesman for roy de 
ronceray and izmery said the suspension of the decree means 
nothing to us a free fair and honest electoral process under 
avril is impossible 
another emergency measure imposing an entry visa for haitian 
citizens was also rescinded monday 
the government declared the state of siege a day after gunmen 
killed an army colonel his wife and their maid avril said the 
crackdown was necessary to protect democratic accomplishments 
against terrorism implying that enemies of the government 
carried out the assassination 
skeptics saw it however as a pretext for avril to consolidate 
his power and renege on his promise to hold legitimate elections 
the emergency measures had provoked world protest 
the united states canadian and french governments and the 
european community condemned the measures france suspended foreign 
aid negotiations and the bush administration indicated there would 
be no early resumption of washingtons 60 million annual aid 
package 
in addition the association of haitian industrialists and the 
haitian chamber of commerce and industry had demanded the emergency 
measures be revoked 
on sunday the 10 bishops of haitis roman catholic episcopal 
conference demanded that the government respect the letter and 
the spirit of the entire constitution that it abolish torture 
in all its forms and that it create a favorable climate for 
free and honest elections this year 
in his speech to the nation avril reaffirmed his governments 
commitment to elections but in a more serene climate 
avril rose to power in a september 1988 coup led by 
noncommissioned officers who professed disgust with the state 
terrorism under the military man they ousted lt gen henri namphy 
he had led the military junta that assumed power when 
presidentforlife jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile in france in 
february 1986 during a popular uprising ending the harsh 27year 
duvalier dynasty 
presidential elections were held on nov 29 1987 but aborted 
after thugs protected by soldiers massacred at least 34 voters at 
polling stations 
civilian leslie manigat won armyrun elections in january 1988 
and was overthrown by namphy in june 1988

a computer did as well as a human therapist in 
treating depression in a new study and researchers say the 
machines may someday help psychotherapists treat the common 
disorder 
computerized treatment might be provided day and night at a cost 
of perhaps 50 cents an hour and the machine doesnt have any bad 
days said researcher john greist 
human therapists now can treat only a fraction of the 10 million 
americans who suffer depression within any sixmonth period he 
said 
but roughly a third of people with depression may one day be 
helped by computerized therapy if further research shows it is 
useful said greist a psychiatry professor at the university of 
wisconsin medical school in madison 
humans would still be needed to screen patients for the therapy 
and to step in if the computer fails to treat the patient 
adequately he said in a recent interview and the therapeutic 
approach used in the study works best for people with only mild to 
moderate depression he said 
the study is presented in this months issue of the american 
journal of psychiatry by greist paulette selmi and others at the 
university 
t byram karasu professor of psychiatry at the albert einstein 
college of medicine in new york called the study important 
but he cautioned that cognitivebehavioral therapy the approach 
used by the computer and the human therapist in the study is 
generally less effective for depression than other strategies 
including medication 
he also stressed that while computers might be useful for some 
aspects of psychotherapy they cannot totally replace a human 
therapist most depressed patients are starving for human 
contact he said 
the study compared the progress of 12 depressed people who 
received therapy from a computer 12 who consulted a therapist and 
12 who received no treatment during the experiment 
the two treated groups followed a sixweek course of weekly 
cognitivebehavioral therapy this approach aims to correct harmful 
patterns in how people interpret their experiences such as in 
people who habitually perceive slights and conclude that they must 
be worthless and not liked 
the therapists job in this approach is fairly routine and can 
become repetitious greist said that makes the regimen a poor 
use of human beings but a good candidate for being done by 
computer he said 
using a program selmi designed the computer in the study asked 
such questions as how long a person had felt depressed and which 
activities in a list made the person feel better it also asked 
about particular symptoms and asked the person to rank the severity 
of his depression on a standard scale 
in this way the computer could get a pretty crisp idea of the 
nature of this persons depression greist said 
the computer used responses to its multiplechoice questions to 
shape the course of each session and future sessions 
the actual therapy included teaching basics of 
cognitivebehavioral therapy testing the persons understanding of 
the lessons and assigning homework depending on the persons 
problems the homework could include such tasks as reading 
particular chapters of books thinking about less damaging 
explanations for perceived slights or introducing oneself to new 
people daily to discover that one is not always rejected 
analysis showed that as a group patients who took computerized 
therapy improved as much as those in the other treated group both 
at the conclusion of treatment and two months later both groups 
improved significantly more than the people who had received no 
therapy

federal officials defended regional air 
traffic controllers who never explicitly told local controllers 
that avianca flight 52 was short on fuel before it crashed killing 
73 of 159 people aboard 
the colombian jetliners cockpit crew told regional 
highaltitude controllers about the fuel shortage 45 minutes before 
thursday nights crash but did not make clear the severity of the 
situation federal aviation administration spokesman fred farrar 
said monday 
the pilot requested only priority clearance to land and 
that word has no particular meaning in air traffic control 
farrar said if there is an emergency you use the word 
emergency 
the faa whose duties include overseeing the nations air 
traffic controllers released a partial transcript of taped 
conversations among the crew and controllers as the national 
transportation safety board today neared the end of its onsite 
investigation 
the transcripts showed that in a telephone conversation the 
regional controllers told counterparts responsible for landings at 
kennedy international airport that the colombian jetliner couldnt 
remain in a holding pattern south of the airport for more than five 
minutes 
but the regional controllers did not explicitly mention the fuel 
shortage the transcripts show 
the flight was cleared for landing at kennedy 37 minutes later 
but that attempt was aborted apparently because of bad weather 
less than 10 minutes later the boeing 707 fell powerless into a 
wooded hillshide in the secluded long island village of cove neck 
the cockpit crew were among those killed more than 20 survivors 
remained hospitalized in critical condition 
faa rules for flight emergencies spell out instructions for 
pilots including those with foreign airlines landing at us 
airports 
if at any time the remaining usable fuel supply suggests the 
need for traffic priority to ensure a safe landing the pilot 
should declare an emergency and report fuel remaining in minutes 
the instructions say 
investigators are considering the possibility that the colombian 
pilot interchanged the words priority and emergency by 
mistake they also planned to talk with avianca officials about 
what instructions are given to pilots when they have fuel problems 
the faa and ntsb as well as the national air traffic 
controllers association stressed monday that the planes message 
was not urgent and did not use the word emergency which would 
have brought the plane to a quick landing at kennedy 
the words emergency or minimum fuel would have 
triggered an emergency response by controllers said controllers 
association president r steve bell stating that you are low on 
fuel does not imply an immediate problem 
another union official who listened to the tapes said that the 
pilot never sounded worried 
he said im running out of fuel just as calm as if he were 
sitting in his living room said barry krasner eastern regional 
representative of the controllers association 
about 845 pm as they were circling over new jersey the 
cockpit crew warned the regional control center that they were low 
on fuel 
we think we may need priority a crew member told the 
control centerl 
a regional controller replied how long can you hold before 
you have to go to your alternate landing site 
wait a minute the cockpit replied pausing apparently to 
check we can hold five minutes shortly thereafter the 
cockpit said the alternate landing site was boston and i cant 
make it 
at that time the faa said the regional controller phoned the 
local controllers and said avianca 52 just came out of cameron 
the name of the holding area and can only do five more minutes of 
hold can you take him now 
the local controller replied slow him to 180 knots and i will 
take him 
after the phone call the plane was released to kennedy it made 
a missed approach 37 minutes later through rain and fog coming in 
too steeply authorities said 
investigators said the crew agreed to a controllers suggestion 
that the plane loop back over long island and come in for a second 
attempt it did so the cockpit saying twice more it was low on 
fuel but the engines soon quit and the plane crashed 
fuel gauges which some pilots say are unreliable in 707s and 
cockpit documents have been taken to a washington lab ntsb member 
lee dickinson said

a briefcase boobytrapped with a sawedoff rifle 
probably was sent as a warning to a federal prosecutor who has 
investigated major heroin traffickers authorities said 
it could have killed the person opening it us attorney 
andrew j maloney said monday i think its because of the kind 
of work this assistant may have been working on 
the briefcase had not been considered suspicious when it was 
delivered by mail monday to the office of assistant us attorney 
catherine palmer it was delivered to the federal courthouse in 
brooklyn despite increased security in the wake of the package 
bombs that killed an federal judge and civil rights lawyer in 
alabama and georgia 
the device was disarmed by federal agents working with ms 
palmer on another case 
they happened to be there and opened the package i think 
it was more luck than anything that it didnt go off maloney 
said 
a police spokeswoman officer janice swinney described the gun 
as a 22caliber rifle set to go off but did not elaborate 
maloney said he believed the device which contained no note or 
other threat was related to ms palmers work as a drug 
prosecutor not to civil rights 
the veteran prosecutor specializes in large asian heroin 
trafficking networks 
the investigation was turned over to the fbi which refused to 
comment

was the town she knew and loved as home said the rev francis 
bradshaw pastor of centenary united methodist church in 
smithfield at the graveside service

publicly but who brought so much to so many privately as well 
bradshaw said she touched lives the world over 
miss gardner wound up with a screen test and a 50aweek 
contract with mgm after photographs taken by her brotherinlaw 
caught the eye of a studio clerk 
between 1942 and 1980 miss gardner made more than 60 feature

the nation needs userfriendly birth control 
methods to reduce its 34 million unplanned pregnancies each year 
and end the war over abortion says a lawmaker backing more 
funding for contraceptive research 
in the 80s iran and the united states were the only two 
countries that really went backward in family planning rep 
patricia schroeder dcol said monday at a planned parenthood 
conference 
we should be discussing where we want to be five years from 
now whether we still want to be at war on these issues or 
whether we want to be at peace 
schroeder said she and rep olympia snowe rmaine decided we 
wanted to be at peace and cosponsored a measure last july to 
make the federal government the leader in finding new methods of 
birth control and techniques against infertility which affects an 
estimated one of six us women 
their proposal calls for spending 772 million over five years 
to establish five new research centers exploring the two issues 
any woman who reads womens magazines knows what the damage of 
the 80s has been schroeder said you pick up any magazine and 
many newspapers and theres constantly some kind of article 
questioning the safety of current contraceptives 
now why isnt the federal government answering those 
questions she asked 
federal funds for such research through the national institutes 
of health and the agency for international development totaled 
308 million in 1988 down from 324 million in 1987 
the amount of dollars spent a year for this research would 
keep the defense department running for 15 minutes said dr 
louise b tyrer vice president of medical affairs for the planned 
parenthood federation of america inc 
schroeder said safety questions over available contraceptive 
methods have reduced options for us women 
theyve been left to what cleopatra had sponges she said 
the question is how do we make contraceptives userfriendly to 
women and to men and that they feel are safe 
lawsuits over intrauterine devices or iuds have undermined the 
ability of most us pharmaceutical companies to market them 
and congress in the 1970s declined to fund federal research into 
birth control methods that would act after conception such as 
ru486 the socalled abortion pill developed by the french 
minutes after schroeder began speaking joe scheidler director 
of the chicagobased prolife action league tried to enter the 
room but was turned back 
theyre trying to get the government to fund research on 
abortifacients and contraceptives he said abortifacients are 
birth control methods that prevent pregnancy after conception 
were very much opposed to the use of government money to 
destroy our children

drug traffickers surrendered 2200 
pounds of dynamite saying they wanted to show they are sincere in 
seeking peace with the government and claimed to be preparing to 
free a kidnapped colombian diplomat 
the cocaine barons said roberto garciapena the countrys 
former consul in miami would be freed with a peace message for 
president virgilio barco who declared war on the traffickers five 
months ago 
colombia has since been terrorized by attacks blamed on drug 
gangs that have claimed at least 209 lives 
the dynamite packed in a bus was found in medellin the 
northwestern city that is a hub of the drug trade the traffickers 
telephoned reporters to offer the reasons they were giving up the 
explosives 
their statement on the kidnapping delivered to the rcn radio 
network said garciapena was abducted friday in bogota and would 
be freed today with the message for barco 
the statement was signed by the extraditables the name adopted 
by the cocaine barons who are trying to force the government to 
abandon extradition of colombians wanted on drug trafficking 
charges in the united states 
a spokesman for the foreign ministry said privately that 
garciapena colombias consul in miami for 18 years until 1988 
disappeared friday but the ministry had not heard from kidnappers 
garciapena 54 is the son of the editor emeritus of colombias 
largest newspaper el tiempo of bogota 
since barco declared war on the cocaine gangs aug 18 after the 
assassination of a leading presidential candidate drug bosses have 
been blamed for 262 bombings and other terrorist attacks 
all 107 passengers aboard a colombian airliner died in a 
november crash blamed on the traffickers 
medellin police said in a news release the dynamite found in the 
bus was not connected to detonators 
also in the bus was a statement saying the traffickers would 
continue giving up explosives it too was signed by the 
extraditables 
the statement accused the national antinarcotics police of 
torture and murder and claimed without giving details the police 
had murdered 10 men arrested on suspicion of being hired killers 
a man saying he spoke for the extraditables called the rcn 
station in medellin on monday and said the traffickers do not 
have any missiles and dont want to attack the united states 
he appeared to be responding to reports in the united states 
that the us secret service had learned the traffickers had 
shoulderfired missiles and might try to attack president bush when 
he visits colombia next month 
bush is to meet with some latin american presidents feb 15 in 
cartagena on colombias north coast for a discussion of what to 
do about drug trafficking 
on jan 17 the extraditables issued a statement saying barco 
had won the drug war and offered to abandon the drug trade give up 
their weapons and release all hostages if granted amnesty 
in return they said they wanted constitutional guarantees they 
did explain but presumably meant assurances they would not be 
extradited to the united states since the drug crackdown began in 
august colombia has extradited 13 suspects for trial 
colombian analysts have said they doubt the traffickers 
considered themselves beaten and believed the offer to abandon the 
drug trade was a ploy to get the government to negotiate 
however since their statement of capitulation the 
extraditables have released six of 22 people kidnapped over the 
last two months 
police said monday they had found a weapons cache on a ranch 
owned by gonzalo rodriguez gacha a leading trafficker killed in a 
gun battle with officers last month 
a news release said they found 170 rifles and 55 pounds of 
dynamite on the veracruz ranch 95 miles north of bogota

a new nasa schedule reduces from 10 
to nine the number of space shuttle launches planned for this year 
with the number rising to 12 in 1992 and 13 in 1993 
its a good plan and we think we can do it launch director 
bob sieck told reporters after a schedule was released monday 
listing 74 shuttle flights between now and the end of 1996 
he noted the launch team has dispatched eight shuttles since 
flights resumed in september 1988 after a 32month hiatus 
following the 1986 challenger explosion 
we have a welltrained and competent team sieck said we 
are seeing more stability in the hardware and the requirements 
were bringing new equipment on line and the performance of the 
logistics system looks good 
he said an orbiter being built to replace challenger will arrive 
here next year and be ready for its first flight in early 1992 in 
time to support the accelerated launch schedule 
nine flights this year would match the record set in 1985 
the elimination of one flight in 1990 was necessitated by a 
delay from march 26 to april 18 in the launch of discovery with the 
hubble space telescope that postponement was announced earlier 
this month after engineers detected a problem with one of the 
shuttles two solid fuel boost rockets 
that also resulted in the delay of another science payload that 
of the gamma ray telescope from june until november and the 
rearranging of other flights 
the dropped 1990 flight that of a strategic defense initiative 
payload was put off nearly 14 months until january 1992 the 
explanation given was that this caused the least disturbance to the 
overall schedule 
the space agencys new longrange plans call for eight flights 
in 1991 12 in 1992 13 in 1993 11 in 1994 11 in 1995 and 10 in 
1996 
this years schedule originally listed nine flights but was 
increased to 10 when a planned december launch of columbia was 
delayed into january that flight launched jan 9 deployed a 
communications satellite and retrieved a science laboratory that 
had orbited for six years 
the new manifest for the remainder of 1990

reportedly is an advanced reconnaissance satellite

a former gang enforcer who turned informer 
testified that he was introduced to john gotti as a man who would 
whack somebody for the reputed mob boss 
james studs mcelroy testified in gottis assault and 
conspiracy trial monday that he was told after another reputed 
mobsters wake that gotti wanted somebody whacked 
the pair met mcelroy said in april 1986 at the wake of frank 
decicco reputedly gottis underboss in the gambino crime family 
in an unusually hostile crossexamination gottis lawyer bruce 
cutler disputed mcelroys testimony calling him a liar a rat 
and a yellow dog 
cutler tried to portray mcelroy 45 as a coward who shot or 
knifed many people but only if they couldnt fight back 
mcelroy said he accompanied james coonan leader of the west 
side gang known as the westies to deciccos wake at a brooklyn 
funeral parlor he quoted gotti as asking coonan is this the 
kid 
according to mcelroy gotti then turned to him and said ive 
heard a lot about you id like to take you to dinner someday 
at another point mcelroy said coonan asked him in gottis 
presence jimmy can you do it mcelroy said he answered that 
he could even though he did not know what coonan was asking about 
you agreed to do it and you didnt know what it was they 
wanted done asked assistant district attorney michael cherkasky 
yeah he replied 
later at a restaurant coonan told him that gottis crime 
family wanted somebody whacked mcelroy testified 
the target was john f oconnor vice president of carpenters 
union local 608 who was shot in the buttocks on may 7 1986 in 
the lobby of a midtown office building 
the prosecution says gotti ordered oconnor shot because he 
hired goons to wreck a mobaffiliated restaurant that was being 
built with nonunion labor 
cutler disputed that mcelroy met gotti at deciccos wake you 
met mr gotti in your dreams didnt you mr mcelroy 
gotti 49 and anthony guerrieri 60 are being tried in state 
court on charges of assault and conspiracy in oconnors shooting 
oconnor who refused to testify at the trial has been indicted 
on larceny perjury and extortion charges partly in connection 
with the destruction of the restaurant 
mcelroy who is serving 60 years in federal prison said he is 
testifying against gotti in the hope that prosecutors will have 
mercy on his girlfriend francine mostyn 43 who was arrested on 
drug charges along with mcelroy 
mcelroy an admitted former drug addict and a heavy drinker 
said that he was hung over and unable to go with three other 
westies members to shoot oconnor on the scheduled morning 
instead they shot oconnor the next day

along with crimes and misdemeanors 
officers at police headquarters have been fighting a leaky roof 
flickering phone system and crumbling walls and they say theyve 
had enough 
weve got to get out of here sgt alan fletcher said 
monday its not a case where were a bunch of crybabies here 
its a case where our health is at stake our safetys at stake 
as the search for new dry digs continues a bucket brigade is 
catching copious leaks throughout the 10yearold building 
fletcher said 
the walls are starting to crumble up pretty good he said 
the water when it comes in now it comes in such large volumes we 
have a platoon of people on the water detail trying to get the 
water off the floor 
the chief does get a direct hit once in a while on his desk 
and he has a plastic sheet to put over his papers fletcher said 
after taking a tour of the waterlogged onestory station last 
week mayor martin j dunn ordered a move 
the general condition of the building has deteriorated to such 
an extent that we have to move out of there within weeks well be 
out of there dunn said 
but officials agree that finding a new headquarters wont be 
easy particularly as massachusetts fiscal woes make scarce state 
funds for this old mill city 
police chief russell j paquette who has emptied a few pails 
himself said money will simply have to be found 
somewhere along the line theyre going to have to do 
something he said 
all told about 30 plastic buckets barrels and assorted trash 
cans are catching drips along with makeshift plastic cones that 
direct leaks to containers 
it leaks down behind my desk and puddles down under my feet 
and this isnt the worst part of the building paquette said 
the water problems have damaged phone lines and electric 
equipment sometimes preventing people from calling in to the 
dispatcher paquette said 
one night paquettes office suddenly went dark for a few 
minutes 
i was scared to touch the switch i was afraid i might get a 
little tickle the chief joked 
problems at the concrete building funded by a federal grant of 
2 million began before it opened in 1980 paquette said the 
roof which was originally constructed for parking has been 
patched several times 
an outofcourt settlement was reached with the design firm some 
years ago but that wasnt enough to fix the problems dunn said 
abandoning the building will mean leaving behind expensive 
bulletproof glass and electricallylocked doors installed in the 
holding cell area the chief said 
that area is one of the driest in the building so prisoners 
havent been as affected by the leaks as officers fletcher said

the government will reduce the 
mandatory sentences of white men convicted of refusing compulsory 
military service from six years to as few as three years officials 
announced 
military service by blacks is voluntary 
defense minister magnus malan said monday night that the 
decision was in keeping with the recent decision to cut compulsory 
military service for white men from two years to one year 
both moves follow announcements of major spending cuts in the 4 
billion military budget officials said the cuts can be made 
because of reduced racial tension 
since taking office on sept 20 president fw de klerk has 
been making conciliatory moves toward the opposition fighting his 
whiteled governments policy of racial separation known as 
apartheid 
under the new sentencing rules religious objectors would do 
three years of community service conscientious objectors could 
have their prison terms reduced to three years based on good 
behavior and other factors malan said 
conscientious objectors convicted of refusing to serve now 
receive an automatic sixyear prison term men who decline to serve 
for religious reasons are required to perform six years of 
community service 
it is only fair and right that the alleviation of military 
service which has already been announced be made applicable to 
religious objectors and those who refuse to render military 
service malan said 
three conscientious objectors are now serving sixyear prison 
terms at least 800 white men have publicly stated their refusal to 
perform military duty but have not been prosecuted 
many young white men who leave south africa cite mandatory 
military service as one of the main reasons 
the end conscription campaign a group opposed to mandatory 
military service said it welcomed the change but it said it wants 
the government also to allow conscientious objectors to do 
community service

defense secretary dick cheney must 
convincingly argue that his 2921 billion military budget is the 
proper us response to changes in the soviet threat members of 
congress say and even then lawmakers may be unwilling to go along 
the defense budget is no longer a sacred cow rep patricia 
schroeder dcolo a senior member of the house armed services 
committee said monday after cheney spelled out his military 
spending plan for fiscal 1991 
the defense secretary citing a diminished conventional threat 
from the warsaw pact nations and budget constraints at home 
proposed an increase from this years 2868 billion in outlays to 
2921 billion a 2 percent reduction after adjusting for 
anticipated inflation 
but at the same time cheney emphasized that the soviet union 
continues to modernize its strategic forces and the united states 
cannot abandon its own hightech weapons such as the b2 stealth 
bomber and the strategic defense initiative 
we are going to retain and require deterrent capability in 
terms of our strategic forces for the indefinite future that will 
not change cheney told reporters at a pentagon briefing on the 
budget 
elaborating on that point on nbcs today show this morning 
cheney said most of the changes seen so far in the soviet military 
posture involve a winding down of conventional forces rather than 
reducing strategic weapons 
i think the test now will be to see whether or not congress 
makes the right kinds of difficult decisions that is to say to cut 
overhead in some of those things that are important political 
considerations back home while we preserve the essence of our 
military capability cheney said of proposed base closings 
at home if we are going to reduce force structure then 
its also important to reduce the base structure that supports 
those you simply dont need as many bases if youre going to have 
a smaller army he said 
the defense secretary testifies on capitol hill later this week 
and spelling out his strategy will be the key with lawmakers 
in my view congress will be more likely to go along with 
these tough decisions if secretary cheney can give us a clear 
vision of where defense policies and programs are going over the 
next five years in light of the changes in the threat and our 
overall strategy said sen sam nunn dga chairman of the 
senate armed services committee 
not surprisingly the defense secretary garnered quick support 
from several republican lawmakers 
we cant let the dramatic changes in europe completely turn 
upside down planning for the future said sen john warner of 
virginia ranking republican on the senate armed services panel 
it would be highly risky if congress went in and made 
unilateral cuts warner said considering the instability in the 
soviet union the constant threat of terrorism and lack of changes 
in the third world 
the bush administrations plan calls for five b2 bombers at a 
cost of 55 billion numbers certain to draw fire on capitol hill 
where lawmakers have complained loudly about the radarevading 
plane considered the most expensive in history at about 530 
million a copy 
the b2 is the first victim of the berlin wall schroeder 
said 
the budget also includes 45 billion for sdi popularly known 
as star wars the total represents a 1 billion increase over last 
year when congress adopted and the administration accepted the 
first reduction in spending for sdi since president reagan 
introduced the antimissile shield six years ago 
im absolutely astounded by the amount asked for sdi said 
rep charles bennett dfla a senior member of the house armed 
services committee admiral william j crowe said 3 billion is 
a generous figure crowe retired last year as chairman of the 
joint chiefs of staff 
the defense budget would continue financing of two landbased 
nuclear missiles with 28 billion to fund railbasing for the 
multiplewarhead mx missile and 202 million for the truckbased 
singlewarhead midgetman 
the budget also calls for 12 billion to involve the us 
military more deeply in bushs antidrug war and to give a 35 
percent military pay raise 
the document envisions a smaller us military force paring 
38000 men and women from the 2 million in uniform primarily from 
attrition in the army and the air force that step would bring the 
active duty force down to roughly equal its 1980 size 
the plan calls for doing away with some 20 small weapons 
systems such as the marine corps v22 osprey and the armys m1 
tank in an attempt to save 29 billion others cuts include the 
navys f14d jet fighter the phoenix and maverick missiles the 
apache helicopter the army helicopter improvement program and the 
f15e fighter 
the navy would lose two of its four battleships from the world 
war ii era the uss iowa and uss new jersey for an estimated 
savings of 75 million 
the most controversial aspect of the budget is the proposal that 
at this time has no savings attached it is a plan to close or 
scale back more than 72 domestic installations and end us 
operations at 12 facilities overseas 
among the major bases targeted are fort ord in california fort 
mcclellan in alabama and the philadelphia naval shipyard a 
significant number of facilities are located in california

ford motor co infringed on a former 
professors patent for the intermittent windshield wiper used on 
its cars a jury ruled in a potentially farreaching and lucrative 
case for the inventor 
the verdict monday could affect similar lawsuits by robert w 
kearns against general motors corp chrysler corp daimlerbenz 
honda toyota nissan and 21 other companies the ford case was the 
first to go to trial 
the federal jury will reconvene feb 26 to establish how much 
ford must pay kearns 
however us district judge avern cohn ruled earlier that 
kearns failed to prove he could have made and marketed the system 
on his own and thus can claim only a royalty on each wiper instead 
of fords profit 
ford had contended the patent was invalid because the windshield 
system contained no new concepts 
but kearns argued a new combination of parts made his invention 
unique the invention allow the driver to set the interval at which 
the wiper sweeps the window 
the jury decided that kearns patent was valid 
kearns claimed in his lawsuit that he installed a set of his 
wipers on a 1962 ford and took it to the automaker 
kearns made numerous disclosures of confidential engineering 
test designs to ford engineers the lawsuit claimed because they 
repeatedly asked him to discuss designs the lawsuit said kearns 
was led to believe ford would buy his system 
kearns his attorneys and ford all said they were forbidden by

communist chief petar mladenov today said 
bulgarias economy was falling apart and that ousted hardline 
ruler todor zhivkov was brutal selfish and stupid 
mladenov told communist party congress that their party faced 
extinction unless it agreed to reforms to promote democracy or 
stabilize an economy in tatters 
he also hinted he would step down and reiterated a plan for an 
interim government that included emerging prodemocracy groups 
mladenov said only such a coalition government is capable of 
leading the country out of the crisis 
but he gave no specifics on what share of power the communists 
would retain in such an administration 
opposition leaders and some reform communists doubted the 
leadership which threw out zhivkov on nov 10 after 35 years of 
uncontested rule was sincere about genuine change 
they want to change anything but their chairs the name of 
the party even their ideals said lyubomir pavlov a senior 
member of the independent trade union podkrepa before the congress 
the leadership has promised multiparty democracy with the first 
free parliamentary elections in more than 40 years in may although 
the opposition has wanted it delayed until november to give it more 
time to organize 
many of the 2790 delegates cheered when mladenov rejected the 
opposition calls insisting they be held not later than may 
mladenov appeared to try to exploit divisions within the still 
weak opposition by reiterating calls for a new government of 
national concord before the may elections 
some opposition leaders reject this idea outright arguing that 
they do not want to be responsible for the chaos caused by four 
decades of communist rule while others have suggested they might 
participate in such an interim cabinet 
mladenov was at his most forthright in criticizing the rule of 
zhivkov who has been arrested on charges of misappropriation of 
state property inciting ethnic hostility and grave abuse of power 
he variously described the former leader under whom he served 
as foreign minister for 18 years as a maniac egoist a 
bearer of a painful suspiciousness and selfishness and a man 
without any intellectual capacities 
mladenov hinted he may make way for a new party chief when he 
suggested the congress vote to split the posts of party chief and 
president which he assumed when zhivkov was ousted 
its my suggestion that the comrades adopt a decision that the 
same person should not be leading the party and the state at the 
same time he said 
there had been unconfirmed speculation that mladenov might stay 
on as president but give up the party job in poland which blazed 
the trail of democratic reform in the east bloc wojciech 
jaruzelski resigned as communist party chief before solidarity took 
control of the government and now holds the post of president 
in the speech mladenov made no mention of ongoing talks with 
the opposition union of democratic forces to put bulgaria on the 
road toward democracy 
his lack of new proposals confirmed opposition fears that the 
party leadership while ready for moderate reforms must take into 
account the conservative mainstream of the party in order to 
maintain power 
despite his remarks on democracy mladenov asserted that 
bulgarias communists whose power has remained more intact than 
that of their comrades elsewhere in eastern europe were the only 
party capable of changing society 
with east germanys erich honecker zhivkov is one of two 
deposed east bloc leaders charged with crimes 
ousted politburo member milko balev a zhivkov loyalist and 
ivan slavkov zhivkovs soninlaw were reportedly under 
investigation for possession of funds they could not explain 
slavkov was also charged with illegal possession of weapons it was 
unclear if slavkov long the head of the bulgarian olympic 
committee and balev were in custody 
this extraordinary party congress was moved up from 1991 to cope 
with growing threats to communist power in bulgaria 
two weeks ago the communistcontrolled legislature followed 
poland hungary east germany and czechoslovakia in amending the 
constitution to strip the communist party of its guaranteed leading 
role in society 
in poland and hungary communist parties that ruled for four 
decades have dissolved and formed new groupings to distance 
themselves from their repressive pasts 
the communist parties in east germany and czechoslovakia are 
still intact though their power is eroding

researchers unveiled a prototype computer 
that uses light instead of electrical impulses to process data and 
said it could be as revolutionary as the transistor which ushered 
in the computer age 
the computer that bell laboratories displayed monday is crude 
with enough power only to operate something like a dishwasher 
within a decade however it could lead to development of 
lightbased supercomputers operating at least 1000 times faster 
than current machines perhaps even 10000 times said brian 
monahan a spokesman for bell labs 
this stage says it can be done said bob trier technical 
program director for research consortium inc of minneapolis which 
studies highperformance computing the next stage is to find out 
what can be done with this technology 
for years researchers have been looking at photons the 
fundamental particles of light as replacements for electrons in 
electronic equipment such a shift promises computers vastly more 
agile and powerful than todays machines 
the prototype data processor is the first to transmit 
information with light rather than electricity the movement of 
electrons the technique could allow a much greater flow of data 
your only limit when it comes to those things is the speed of 
light said jim hammons an analyst at the sierra group computer 
consulting firm in tempe ariz 
unlike current computer chips information would pass not just 
from a chips edges but also from its surface bell labs physicist 
david miller likened the development to a manhattan island in new 
york city where cars suddenly werent limited to bridges and 
tunnels at rush hour but could leave through the air 
by the end of the decade supercomputers could be using more 
light or photonic components rather than electronic and may 
run at least 1000 times faster than todays generation monahan 
said 
the prototype a variety of lasers lenses and prisms in a 
2footsquare box differs from a true computer in that the 
program that runs the optical processor is built into its hardware 
rather than being contained in software said bell labs spokeswoman 
marj mckean it also has limited memory she said 
she said the processor originally took up three large lab 
benches eventually scientists believe it can be reduced to the 
size of todays microchips no larger than a fingernail 
transmitting light impulses as fiber optics do is nothing new 
but controlling them is another thing 
they have found a way to hold a piece of light said trier 
the photonic computer depends on new chips that pass light 
impulses between each other through lenses that perform the 
function of wires bell labs officials said 
officials at american telephone amp telegraph co which owns bell 
labs likened the development to that of the transistor which made 
it possible to make electronic devices smaller sturdier and more 
reliable the transistor was developed at bell labs in 1947

a senior aide to prime minister yitzhak shamir 
denied today that israel urged soviet jews to settle in the 
occupied west bank and gaza strip where palestinians have been 
fighting for independence 
it has not been our policy and will not be in the future 
anyone who comes to israel can go wherever he chooses said yossi 
benaharon the head of shamirs office 
benaharon said better employment opportunities are attracting 
soviet immigrants to the center of the country and that only a few 
hundred immigrants out of a total of 12000 last year chose to live 
on the land captured from jordan and egypt in 1967 
benaharon responded to soviet and us criticism of shamirs 
statement earlier this month suggesting israel has to retain the 
occupied territoriesto settle the expected wave of soviet 
immigrants 
in moscow a top soviet foreign ministry official summoned 
israels top diplomat arye levin to strongly condemn 
endangering soviet emigres by using them to crowd palestinians out 
of their own land the soviet news agency tass said monday 
the official first deputy foreign minister yuli vorontsov 
suggested that settling soviet immigrants in the disputed areas 
could forestall moscows plans to further liberalize emigration 
laws and allow more jews to come to israel 
levin who flew to israel today for what he described as a 
family visit told reporters he was not under the impression 
that the soviets were threatening to curtail immigration 
another shamir aide avi pazner suggested that the soviets were 
trying to allay fears by palestinians and arab leaders 
the arabs are exerting heavy pressure on the russians 
concerning the immigration and mr shamir expressed his hope that 
the artificial storm would pass pazner said 
us state department spokesman richard boucher was quoted by 
the jerusalem post as telling reporters in washington monday that 
putting even more settlers into the territories is an obstacle to 
the cause of peace 
israeli legislators and soviet jewish activists in israel have 
accused shamir of endangering jewish immigration at a time of 
growing concern about antisemitism in the soviet union 
yitzhak abrahmson head of a soviet immigrants group said on 
israel radio he was worried that shamirs statement about using 
occupied land for new arrivals would lead to a soviet clampdown on 
issuing exit visas 
three leftwing parties have filed noconfidence motions in the 
knesset or parliament to protest shamirs remark 
in a related development the head of a soviet diplomatic 
delegation in israel georgi martirosov blamed shamir for the 
delay in resuming direct flights between the soviet union and 
israel 
such flights could be a boost to soviet immigration to israel 
because it would channel all jews leaving moscow directly to tel 
aviv in the past many have stayed in europe and sought refuge in 
western countries 
chances of implementing such an agreement are zero and 
shamirs statements hindered any possibility of moving this 
process forward martirosov was quoted as saying by the jerusalem 
post 
moscow broke diplomatic ties with israel over its occupation of 
arab territory in the 1967 middle east war it supports palestinian 
demands for an independent state in the occupied lands and says the 
restoration of full ties with israel is conditional on progress in 
middle east peace efforts

faced with a soaring federal health care bill 
the bush administration is proposing incentives in its new budget 
to encourage lowercost and preventive care 
the incentives would be built into the medicare and medicaid 
health insurance programs to help stem spiraling cost increases 
that have driven combined spending in the two programs to 148 
billion this year 
the budget would encourage managed care that is health 
maintenance organizations and physicians networks that treat 
patients under a single comprehensive organization designed to 
save costs 
we are bullish on managed care kevin moley assistant 
secretary for management and budget at the department of health and 
human services said monday 
under president bushs proposed fiscal 1991 budget spending for 
medicare and medicaid would increase to 1105 billion for medicare 
and 45 billion for medicaid 
but spending growth in the programs would be trimmed by about 
55 billion from what they would otherwise spend without changes 
in the programs growth would be stemmed by paring payments to 
hospitals and physicians 
for both the medicare and medicaid programs the administration 
wants to encourage managed care plans as alternatives to the 
traditional feeforservice health care delivery systems 
government health economists say hmos and preferred provider 
organizations called ppos put more emphasis on preventive care 
and are more efficient than traditional systems 
the administration is proposing financial incentives for states 
to enroll medicaid recipients in hmos 
in the medicare program the administration wants to encourage 
managed care by increasing the payment threshold for certain 
approved hmos from 95 percent of the cost of care to 100 percent 
that would add about 180 million to the medicare budget next 
year but would eventually reap benefits if more medicare 
recipients chose hmos which also protect against the financial 
devastation of catastrophic illnesses 
this proposal would reduce premiums for enrollees but hhs 
officials said they did not know by how much 
another proposal called medicare plus is being worked out to 
help develop a market for ppos by coordinating medigap insurance 
policies with these provider networks 
as envisioned the government would put its seal of approval on 
ppos that meet specified standards for comprehensiveness and 
quality of care 
medicare will serve 314 million elderly and 33 million 
disabled americans in the 1991 fiscal year according to hhs 
figures the medicaid program a federal and state effort covers 
about 26 million of the nations poor 
the bush administration also proposed increasing aids spending 
for research prevention and education by about 7 percent to 17 
billion total aids spending by hhs and other federal agencies 
including medicare and medicaid payments to aids patients would 
rise 18 percent to nearly 35 billion 
the national organizations responding to aids denounced the 
increase in research and prevention efforts as woefully 
insufficient particularly in the face of the doubling caseload 
this nation will be experiencing during the next year

a former policeman said he helped 
escort 40 tons of gold to switzerland so it could be deposited in 
nicolae ceausescus bank account the state news agency said today 
the official rompress news agency quoted an unidentified former 
police official who said he was on a september 1980 flight that 
carried 25 tons of gold ingots and an october 1980 flight that 
carried 15 tons 
the gold escorted by security officers and finance ministry 
officials was loaded in trucks in zurich in the presence of 
romanian diplomats the police official reportedly said 
he estimated that ceausescu had deposited about 400 million in 
gold in swiss banks but other sources put the figure at 1 billion 
dollars rompress said 
ceausescu was toppled by a violent uprising in december and 
executed on dec 25 after 24 years in power there have been 
numerous reports that he and his family lived in excessive luxury 
while romanians endured poverty and oppression 
the daily romania libera called on former ceausescu aides who 
took part in alleged smuggling of gold or western cash to help the 
new authorities recover the tremendous values transferred 
abroad by the former dictator 
swiss lawmakers have pledged to help in tracing hundreds of 
millions of dollars that ceausescu reportedly hid in swiss or other 
foeign banks but said there was not yet proof of any momey had 
been transferred to switzerland 
henrich rittmeyer a swiss lawmaker who visited bucharest in 
midjanuary said the process of finding ceausescus missing 
millions could be difficult 
its extremely difficult he told a news conference jan 14 
the romanian government and romanian bank representatives dont 
know yet how much money is missing 
he added that if ceausescu had smuggled a fortune out of 
romania it was probable some of it could be found in swiss 
accounts but said the process could take years

a progovernment newspaper 
today said president fw de klerk plans to ease the 43monthold 
state of emergency and lift restrictions on the media 
the citizen newspaper said de klerk will announce the changes 
friday at an address before parliament but he is not expected to 
release jailed black leader nelson mandela until midfebruary at 
the earliest 
there has been an surge in political unrest recently and the 
government is concerned that freeing mandela could set off violence 
among the disenfranchised black majority 
the citizen which has good contacts within the government said 
the immediate release of mandela also would distract attention from 
de klerks speech to parliament when he is expected to outline his 
plans for reform 
the newspaper said the president is likely to remove press 
restrictions that are part of the wideranging emergency measures 
in effect since june 1986 the media curbs which have not been 
widely enforced prohibit reporting on unrest and some forms of 
protest 
however de klerk will maintain some of the emergency security 
measures to quell unrest the newspaper said 
in the latest incident police today fired tear gas and rubber 
bullets to disperse about 1000 black demonstrators some of whom 
threw stones and erected barricades of burning tires in the 
mangaung township near the central city of bloemfontein police 
reported 45 arrests 
the blacks were seeking to leave the township and march on a 
sports stadium where an english cricket team was playing in

soviet president mikhail s gorbachev met with 
premier hans modrow of east germany today and appeared less 
resistant to eventual germany reunification saying the matter 
remains open to debate 
speaking to reporters at a news conference after their meeting 
modrow said gorbachev did not rule out such a prospect in the 
future and at the same time did not venture to set some time 
limits for that 
earlier gorbachev told reporters that any decisions must 
include the four allied powers and take into account european 
opinions 
the development of events in the world in east germany in 
the soviet union demand deep consideration and an analytical 
approach to deciding this problem he said 
time itself is acting on this process giving it dynamism 
the soviet leader said we have to act responsibly and not 
decide this important question on the streets 
his remarks were reported by the tass news agency asked by an 
east german tv correspondent about his attitude toward 
reunification gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and 
that no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it 
tass reported 
however the englishlanguage tass translation raised questions 
whether gorbachev meant that there could be no doubts about 
reunification 
the soviet union in past years has strongly opposed any talk of 
german reunification but has mellowed somewhat as gorbachev 
remolds foreign policy and democratic change sweeps eastern europe 
soviets now say that the question of german reunification is one 
to be decided in the future 
gorbachev in comments to reporters after meeting french 
president francois mitterrand in kiev in december reiterated his 
view that the existence of two german states is a fact based on the 
outcome of world war ii 
but he added the present situation is the result of specific 
historical events a specific historical process on this continent 
so history should should decide the future of this continent 
he urged against rushing with a decision on reunification i 
dont think it is a topical question today a different approach 
may create a situation that would complicate the entire european 
process including the relations between the two german states 
gorbachev said at the time 
modrow said the two german states could work in a series of 
stages toward a form of confederation with no time limit set on it 
he said he agreed with gorbachev that the question of 
reunification is not only one that must be decided by east and west 
germany but by all of europe 
its difficult to set some time limit because it must be 
supported by the european people and that must be in line with the 
treaty on the development of the confederation with all its 
substance and implications modrow said 
in light of that concept the european nations will probably 
understand it in the following way we must be very cautious 
about the process he added 
according to the tass report the soviet leader added that any 
action taken on germany reunification must not infringe on the 
interests of either east or west germany the four allied powers 
france britain the united states or the soviet union or anyone 
else in europe 
soviet premier nikolai i ryzhkov and foreign minister eduard a 
shevardnadze joined gorbachev for the meeting with modrow who 
arrived in moscow on a oneday visit late monday 
modrow arrived after a stormy session of parliament in which the 
east germany prosecutor announced that former hardline leader 
erich honnecker will go on trial in march for treason 
modrow a communist also has moved forward the countrys first 
free elections from may to march 18 and brought the opposition into 
a coalition that will govern until then

cripple creek residents voted 15238 over the weekend in favor 
of gambling to support historic preservation and make other 
improvements the twin mountain towns of black hawk and central 
city 40 miles west of denver also want gambling 
all three towns would limit gambling licenses to their historic 
districts limit dollar amounts and restrict gambling to slot 
machines poker and blackjack 
two state legislators have said they will introduce a resolution 
to put the proposed constitutional amendment on the november 
ballot but as now written the resolution would allow gambling 
only in central city and black hawk 
by 1904 some 14 years after gold was first found in the area 
the 24squaremile cripple creekvictor mining district had 100000 
people and 200 bars saloons and gambling parlors 
today there are about 15 bars and the winter population is less 
than 1 percent of the boom days total most businesses close in the 
winter after a summer rush of about 200000 people 
we are dying on the grapevine it gets dark every night and we 
twiddle out thumbs while people take their money to deadwood

crack cocaine pleaded guilty today to a drugrelated charge 
james mcwilliams pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of 
aiding and abetting drug possession before us magistrate deborah 
a robinson the crime carries a maximum penalty of one year in 
jail and a 100000 fine 
mcwilliams has been described as a longtime friend of charles 
lewis a convicted drug dealer who has testified that he sold crack 
to barry and smoked it with him in december 1988 
mcwilliams and his attorney daniel masur declined to comment 
on the plea they were immediately taken by deputy us marshals to 
a grand jury meeting room 
barry who has denied using drugs was arrested in an fbi sting 
operation on jan 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine possession charge for 
allegedly smoking crack in a washington hotel room he is in a 
private facility in florida for what an aide says is primarily 
treatment of alcoholism 
mcwilliams a motor vehicles department employee is expected to 
appear before a grand jury investigating barrys ties to lewis 
according to a law enforcement source who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
mcwilliams has told prosecutors he saw barry and lewis enter the 
bathroom of lewis hotel room where they allegedly smoked crack 
cocaine before emerging a short time later said a law enforcement 
source 
allegations that barry used cocaine in the past were also 
supported by carol bland jackson a former business partner of the 
woman who lured barry into the fbi sting she said in interviews 
monday that she and others used cocaine with barry at a party in 
1986 
lewis pleaded guilty in the nations capital to cocaine 
conspiracy charges last november and was convicted on cocaine 
distribution charges in the virgin islands last spring 
in meetings with prosecutors in the past week mcwilliams also 
said the mayor called him after barrys ties to lewis became public 
and told him he trusted him to keep quiet about what he had seen in 
the hotel room two law enforcement sources said 
barry has said he only called mcwilliams to urge him to 
cooperate with authorities investigating the case 
sources have said that in addition to mcwilliams members of 
barrys police security detail are expected to appear before the 
grand jury investigating the mayor 
the police officers who are assigned to the mayor on a 
roundtheclock basis are expected to be asked whether they saw 
barry use drugs during his visits to lewis hotel room or on other 
occasions according to a law enforcement source familiar with the 
case 
r kenneth mundy barrys attorney said he was unaware of any 
deal mcwilliams may have struck with prosecutors

cant do in public spaces no parking no dogs no smoking no 
spitting no left turn

thats what a sign on an east river pier seems to indicate but 
a spokesman for the department of ports and trades wants lovers to 
know the city is not getting into the weddingbusting business 
the sign using the international symbol for prohibition has a 
bride and groom inside a circle with a slash through it 
its a funky sign and we made it in a fun way department 
spokesman frances resheske said today we didnt mean to imply 
that weddings are prohibited just that people are not allowed to 
close off the pier to the public 
resheske said many couples holding receptions at an adjacent 
restaurant in the borough of queens were led to believe they could 
hold private ceremonies on the pier 
the pier has an unobstructed view of the manhattan skyline and 
has become a popular pedestrian walkway for local residents and a 
wedding hot spot 
we were getting complaints that it was being closed many 
saturdays and sundays in the summer said resheske 
were not antiweddings if someone wanted to go out tomorrow 
with a judge and get married on the pier fine you just cant 
close it off

security was tight today at the opening of the 
trial of a black man accused of murdering a white teacher a case 
linked to the mailbomb slayings of a judge and a lawyer 
extra guards were called in and spectators arriving for the 
trial of emmanuel fitzgerald hammond had to pass through metal 
detectors in the lobby and at the courtroom entrance guards also 
searched purses and brief cases 
hammond is charged with murder kidnapping and armed robbery in 
the shotgun slaying of preschool teacher julie love prosecutors 
are seeking the death penalty 
security was heavy because of the attention given to the 
yearlong search for the victim whose body was found last summer 
and because of a letter claiming a federal judge and a civil rights 
lawyer were assassinated in retaliation for loves death 
i dont think weve had any threats said sheriffs capt 
jc booker this is just a precaution 
superior court judge ralph hicks this morning delayed the start 
of jury selection at the request of prosecutors who asked defense 
attorney william a wehunt to reveal whether he plans an insanity 
defense 
wehunt said he had not been able to talk to psychologists who 
examined hammond to determine how extensive the use of drugs has 
affected this mans mental powers hicks granted a recess so that 
wehunt could contact the doctors 
a letter signed by americans for a competent federal judicial 
system last month claimed responsibility for bombs that killed 
us circuit judge robert vance in mountain brook ala and 
attorney robert robinson in savannah ga 
the letter which became the focus of the fbis investigation 
into the december mail bombings expressed rage over ms loves 
slaying saying it demonstrated the writers contention that the 
judicial system lets black men get away with crimes against white 
women 
even before the mail bomb case became linked with ms loves 
slaying the atlanta womans death had been one of the areas 
highestprofile crimes 
police said ms love 27 was abducted by two men on an atlanta 
road the night of july 11 1988 her abandoned car was found three 
days later in the citys fashionable buckhead neighborhood 
more than a year later after a nationally publicized search in 
which have you seen julie love posters and billboards were 
plastered across the city her remains were found last august in a 
trashstrewn wooded area in atlanta 
hours before ms loves remains were found police charged 
hammond and his 20yearold cousin william porter with her 
slaying 
in november porter pleaded guilty to felony murder rape 
kidnapping and armed robbery he has not been sentenced and is 
expected to testify against hammond

vice president dan quayle home from a 
threenation trip is proclaiming a bright future for panama even 
as some nations in the region refuse to recognize its 
usinstalled government 
jamaica underscored its refusal monday on the last stop of 
quayles threeday trip 
quayle today briefed president bush on his visits to honduras 
panama and jamaica and gave him a number of ideas on pushing 
us policy forward in the region said the vice presidents 
press secretary david beckwith 
quayle said earlier he also gave bush a very upbeat verbal 
report on his trip during a telephone call en route home from 
jamaica monday night 
however the vice president acknowledged that while the united 
states is pressing for other central american countries to 
recognize the government of president guillermo endara jamaica and 
venezuela are insisting that elections be held there to legitimize 
endara first 
as far as were concerned hes legitimized now quayle told 
reporters flying home with him from kingston the election last may 
7 which observers said endara won but which was invalidated by 
gen manuel antonio noriega was a free and fair election he 
added 
however quayle today raised the possibility that balloting on 
other offices and issues before endaras term expires in 1994 could 
satisfy the demands of latin american leaders for an election 
there are approximately six to nine seats in the national 
assembly that will not have a member because they couldnt certify 
who won so they have to have have elections there he said on 
abctvs good morning america 
two the constitution will have to be amended primarily 
because of the changes president endara wants to do in the pdf 
panamanian defense force and therefore there is a possibility 
that perhaps the amendments to the constitution could be offered as 
a plebiscite that would constitute an election quayle added 
as he left panama quayle praised endaras plans to build a 
national police force in place of an army to develop a freemarket 
economy and to help crack down on laundering of drug money 
quayle predicted other countries in the region would recognize 
endaras government 
i come away with a deep feeling of optimism about the 
future of panama im optimistic that democracy will be developed 
and will prevail he said im optimistic that other latin 
american countries will join in helping the endara government 
later monday jamaican prime minister michael manley said 
jamaica is not ready to recognize endaras government 
what we do about the endara government will largely be 
determined by the speed with which normality is restored and 
whether we feel some process is embarked upon that would 
demonstrate legitimacy by some sort of expression of the peoples 
will in a vote manley said during a press conference with quayle 
manley also said he still objects to the dec 20 us invasion 
of panama although he understood why bush undertook it 
quayle ran into similar sentiments in his talks with venezuelan 
president carlos andres perez whom he saw at the presidential 
inauguration saturday in honduras and spoke with again by 
telephone from air force two on monday 
quayle was tasked by bush with smoothing over the negative 
feelings aroused throughout the region when bush sent invasion 
troops to panama like jamaica most of the latin nations felt the 
invasion was a violation of panamas sovereignty 
quayle acknowledged his visit had not reversed those sentiments 
but he stressed the significance of his talks was that the other 
countries would look ahead not backward 
yes friends have a disagreement on the decision itself he 
said but as friends we are committed to moving forward and 
were going to move the process forward thats the most important 
thing 
besides holding talks with endara and manley quayle met with 
the presidents of guatemala el salvador belize costa rica 
honduras and venezuela when all attended the honduran inauguration 
concerns about potential cuts in us economic assistance were a 
common theme 
manley said his government believed it stood to lose 25 million 
in economic support funds but that quayle indicated he was 
certainly sympathetic toward the problem 
quayle promised the 25 million part of 124 million overall 
in us aid to jamaica last year would not be completely slashed 
but he refused to say how much jamaica might lose 
he said the administration wants congress to give bush more 
flexibility to free up the foreign aid money which is now mostly 
earmarked for a handful of countries with a comparatively small sum 
left over to be divided among the remaining beneficiaries in the 
world

meanwhile an east berlin court rejected the communistdominated 
governments request to keep its ousted leader erich honecker

the chief prosecutors office appealed mondays decision by an 
east berlin court to the east german magistrates office but the 
appeal was denied said prosecutors office spokesman dieter plath 
honecker who was arrested and jailed earlier monday was 
expected to be freed later today the reasons for the east berlin

process of overcoming europes overall divisions 
andre brie a leading ideologist for the reformed party said 
german unity must not occur as fast as possible but as slowly as 
is required 
he said there must remain two german states for some time to 
ensure european stability 
brie and jochen willerding another leading party official 
unveiled a document in which the party as part of its campaign for 
elections calls for a united free and demilitarized europe 
willerding also announced the party leadership would meet on 
sunday and likely change the partys name 
willerding said his party would rename itself simply party of 
democratic socialism following the lead of the polish and 
hungarian parties that are trying to remodel themselves into social 
democratic organizations 
honecker who ruled east germany for 18 years before his ouster 
after the prodemocracy revolt in october is one of a dozen former 
communist party politburo members facing charges of corruption and 
abuse of office 
honecker was arrested on monday as he left an east berlin 
hospital where he had undergone surgery to remove a malignant 
kidney tumor he was taken to the capitals rummelsburg prison 
the disgraced former leader is to be tried in march on a charge 
of high treason prosecutor hansjuergen joseph announced to 
parliament on monday doctors who treated honecker at charite 
hospital contended he was still too ill to be jailed 
honecker who ruled east germany for 18 years before his ouster 
in last falls peaceful prodemocracy revolt is one of a dozen

corruption and abuse of office 
he is accused of leading the nation to the brink of economic 
collapse through mismanagement and misuse of office for personal 
enrichment if convicted he could spend the rest of his life in 
prison 
prosecuting the figures of the past has taken a back seat to 
dealing with the crises of the present however 
at mondays a parliamentary session embattled communist premier 
hans modrow offered a grim account of the state of the nation 
economic failures and widespread unrest forced modrow to move up 
east germanys firstever free elections by two months to march 18

this important question on the streets 
modrow told parliament that strikes protests and the mass 
flight of people to the west has endangered the existence of the 
country 
under a coalition plan agreed to late sunday each of the nine 
opposition groups that have been taking part in the weekly

romanias more than 20 political parties some new and some 
revamped since the december revolution toppled the 24year 
dictatorship of nicolae ceausescu radio bucharest said that 
similar consultations will take place weekly 
a series of demonstrations has taken place since the front 
which took over as an interim government following the popular 
revolution that toppled dictator nicolae ceausescu in december 
announced it would take part in elections in may 
on monday about 15000 supporters of the revolutionary 
government rallied in the capital breaking into the headquarters 
of the liberal party and forcing the leader of the national 
peasants party to flee his partys offices in an armored personnel 
carrier 
constantin teodorescu a liberal leader accused the front of 
trying to destroy the opposition parties and planning to install a 
new communist dictatorship if it wins power in the elections 
we already have a dictatorship of the communist party under 
the front government he said 
in the aftermath of the attack on his own headquarters peasant 
party vice president virgil lambru refused to blame the front 
we cant say that because that would mean a war with the 
front he said 
however peasant party official ion ratiu laid the blame on the 
government 
mondays wellorganized demonstrations many participants were 
workers who arrived in the city center in governmentowned trucks 
and buses showed that the people who took charge when ceausescu 
was overthrown last month are capable of mobilizing considerable 
support 
but government critics said the way workers turned out to back 
the government smacked of the timeworn tactics of the east blocs 
deposed communist regimes 
one month after romanians toppled eastern europes most 
hardline communist regime in a bloody revolution political 
stability seems far off 
the resignation of aurel dragos munteanu from the front came 
four days after interim vice president dumitru mazilu stepped down 
and accused the front of using stalinist methods 
munteanu head of the broadcast media that played a major role 
in fueling the revolution was one of the most visible figures of 
the front acting as spokesman at news conferences although he was 
not on the fronts unelected 11man governing council 
munteanus resignation was announced late monday night on state 
tv the only reason given was the need for objectivity in broadcast 
reporting 
there was no indication whether munteanus move was a 
facesaving tactical maneuver by the front or whether it would 
lead to a more equitable distribution of broadcasting time among 
political parties 
the front has so far refused to relinquish its monopoly over 
broadcasting despite protests from opposition parties that they 
have no way of getting their political message across to the 
electorate 
testimony today continued against four of ceausescus top 
associates during the third day of their trial before a military 
tribunal on charges of complicity to commit genocide 
the four former interior minister tudor postelnicu former 
central committee secretary emil bobu and former politburo members 
manea manescu and ion dinca have pleaded guilty to the charge 
which stems from the shooting of demonstrators in december that 
sparked the uprising 
the state rompres news agency reported that after the military 
prosecutor and the defense counsel requested new evidence the 
trial was adjourned until thursday 
the defendants face a maximum penalty of life in prison 
ceausescu and his wife elena were convicted of the charge and 
executed dec 25 the new government later abolished capital 
punishment

sen daniel patrick moynihan told the nations 
largest senior citizens group today his plan to cut social security 
taxes poses no risk of benefit cuts and would help keep the system 
financially sound 
reducing the payroll tax to stop the government from using 
surplus social security revenues for other purposes would help 
ensure public confidence in the system moynihan told the american 
association of retired persons 
there would be no risk to benefits at any time the new york 
democrat said we are having the system perform just as it was 
originally intended to do 
the bush administration has said moynihans plan eventually 
would lead to benefit cuts treasury secretary nicholas brady today 
called the proposal goofy and the height of folly 
brady said americans have faith in the social security system as 
it currently works people dont talk about it they think the 
money is there in the social security trust funds 
he says because of the surplus you can reduce the taxes i 
say thats goofy brady told a white house briefing 
moynihan has voiced concern that social securitys growing trust 
fund reserves are being used to mask the true size of the federal 
deficit and to pay for other government programs his solution is 
to halt the buildup of the reserves and return social security to a 
payasyougo system in which taxes would be raised in the next 
century to finance retirement benefits then 
moynihan said that if the government continues to use the trust 
funds for other purposes it could cause a loss of trust that could 
be a seismic event 
this has the makings of a massive loss of trust he said 
the bush administration in its proposed fiscal 1991 budget 
unveiled a rival plan that would use social securitys surpluses to 
retire government debt once the federal budget is balanced 
moynihan said that plan was unacceptable because it postpones 
dealing with the problem 
the new york democrat addressed the aarps national legislative 
council which has not yet taken a position on the moynihan plan

the government has built more than 
600 miles of electrically charged fences to keep wild elephants 
from destroying crops a newspaper said tuesday 
the fences are not designed to killed the animals but only to 
scare them away from the plantations said mohamed khan momin khan 
directorgeneral of the national parks department 
the problem is a result of malaysias expanding crops which 
have forced the countrys 1000 or so wild elephants off the jungle 
lands they once roamed as the land is cleared for oil palm rubber 
and other crops the elephants return in search of food and eat the 
crops mohamed told the new straits times 
since 1969 elephants have caused more than 111 million damage 
to crops he said 
mohamed said his department has begun rounding up the elephants 
and trucking them to areas far from the plantations but up to 500 
of the animals have yet to be caught 
authorities built more than 600 miles of fences that carry 
enough of an electrical shock to drive the animals away but not 
kill them he added 
still when they can find no other food the elephants sometimes 
crash through the fences to get at crops he said 
department rangers then rush to areas where crops are being 
attacked track down the elephants shoot them with tranquilizer 
guns and chain them to trees 
flanked by two tame elephants the wild elephants then are 
coaxed onto trucks and moved to new locations

the government lifted curfew in this 
violencetorn kashmir city for eight hours tuesday giving 
residents their longest taste of freedom in 10 days 
at least one incident of violence was reported witnesses said 
moslem militants agitating for independence shot another moslem 
claiming he was helping the indian government in its crackdown on 
the secessionist movement 
the 23yearold man identified only as kauser was taken to a 
hospital said the witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity 
his condition was not known 
other witnesses said about 5000 people demonstrated during the 
curfew relaxation to protest the alleged entry by paramilitary 
policemen into a mosque there was no violence said the witnesses 
who also spoke on condition of anonymity 
meanwhile municipal workers removed hundreds of garbage cans 
piled on streets and grocers sold fresh fruit for the first time 
since the curfew was imposed in srinagar on jan 20 after clashes 
between security forces and moslem separatists 
the moslem militants demand either independence for kashmir or 
unity with moslem pakistan kashmir is a part of the state of 
jammukashmir the only indian state with a majority moslem 
population most indians are hindus 
srinagar the states summer capital and once a popular holiday 
retreat is the flashpoint of the kashmiri movement 
at least 72 people mostly moslem males have been killed in 
kashmir since jan 20 the state government said monday there had 
been no violence for the previous four days 
the curfew was lifted for seven hours monday and that was 
extended to eight hours tuesday 
pakistan and india have fought two wars over kashmir since they 
were partitioned in 1947 upon gaining independence from britain 
the state is divided into pakistani and indian sectors by a 
unmonitored line of control 
india accuses neighboring pakistan of aiding the kashmiri 
militants a charge that has been routinely denied but paskistan 
says it supports the separatism describing it as a movement for 
selfdetermination 
pakistani foreign minister sahabzada yaqub khan called tuesday 
for india to allow the kashmir dispute to be decided in a popular 
vote 
it is an outstanding issue which is to be resolved through a 
plebiscite under the united nations supervision he said in a 
nationally televised speech 
the indian government is trying to suppress the freedom 
movement in kashmir through atrocities resulting in deaths of 
hundreds of kashmiris and injuries to many more yaqub khan said 
the indian crackdown began after moslem militants stepped up 
attacks on the government burning stateowned buildings 
assassinating at least three intelligence agents and kidnapping the 
daughter of a cabinet minister in srinagar in december 
she was released after the government freed five jailed members 
of the proindependence jammukashmir liberation front

a report to congress says poor uneducated and 
isolated citizens are likely to suffer from an information gap 
in the next century unless the government sets policies to deal 
with advances in communications 
the office of technology assessment said that given the 
direction of technological change and current policy uncertainties 
the gap is likely to increase between those who can afford and make 
effective use of communications services and those who cannot 
government indecision in dealing with the rapidly developing 
technologies in computers telephones and video will affect not 
only the realm of communication but other key areas such as 
business as well ota said in a report critical connections 
communications for the future 
the study released tuesday was requested by rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce committee 
congress is considering bills that would boost us 
competitiveness in advanced technologies including communications 
by encouraging manufacturing partnerships 
it also is expected to consider later this year whether to 
allow the regional bell telephone companies into the information 
services businesses from which they were barred following the 1984 
breakup of the american telephone and telegraph co 
the bush administration favors easing antitrust laws to pave the 
way for joint production arrangements but it has been criticized 
for footdragging in detailing an overall technology policy and for 
apparently considering cuts in federal support for some 
hightechnology research projects 
ota a nonpartisan analytical arm of congress identified a 
number of factors that may deprive the poor the undereducated and 
the geographically and technologically isolated portions of the 
public and small and mediumsized businesses 
they included 
shifting government subsidies 
increased costs for the use of technology 
growth in the economic power and concentration of many media 
disagreement among policymakers about what should constitute 
universal service 
ota said the concept of providing universal telephone service on 
a common shared network is breaking down it raised the 
possibility that a twotiered telecommunications system one 
public the other private may develop 
if businesses view their needs as unique and decide to develop 
their own private networks as some are doing now there may be 
insufficient revenues available to support an advanced public 
network to serve all individuals ota said 
ota listed different strategies congress could adopt to improve 
access to communications services 
influence the means by which communication services are 
financed 
structure the prices at which communication services are 
offered 
regulate or redefine the rights of media owners

biologists believe floridas only 
endangered fish species is being squeezed out of its habitat by 
another species descended from discarded bait fish 
brown darters apparently were introduced into florida panhandle 
streams years ago when fishermen cleaned out their bait buckets 
the newcomers are now outcompeting native okaloosa darters for 
food and habitat and the us fish and wildlife service is 
conducting a study to find out why 
only 1500 to 10000 of the twoinch long okaloosa darters are 
believed to be left in streams leading into rocky and boggy bayous 
the only places in the world where they are found 
both fish eat worms and insects 
the okaloosa darter is related to the tennesse snail darter 
another endangered species that was the center of a controversy in 
1978 delaying completion of a huge dam because of fears it would 
wipe out the last of the tiny fish 
the okaloosa darter doesnt face such a threat most of its 
habitat is on eglin air force bases military reservation weapons 
testing on the reservation has not harmed the darter said 
biologist noel burkhead and jim williams who is heading the study 
both work out of the national fisheries research center in

white house budget director richard g darman 
clashed with congressional democrats today over whether president 
bushs 123 trillion 1991 budget is based on realistic economic 
forecasts 
darman responded to criticism from rep leon panetta dcalif 
chairman of the house budget committee who noted that office of 
management and budget projections on economic growth inflation and 
unemployment are considerably more optimistic than those of private 
forecasters 
you are not dealing with people who are totally out of 
bounds in trying to project what direction the economy will take 
over the next several months darman told the house budget 
committee he said omb which he heads has been remarkably close 
to accurate in forecasts made last july 
panetta said the administrations economic assumptions and use 
of such tactics as shifting payments from one year to another to 
make the deficit look smaller call into question whether the 
deficit is being taken seriously 
of course the president is serious i am serious darman 
shot back i wish you had taken that on some faith 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota senior republican on the 
committee defended bushs budget which was made public monday as 
a pretty good beginning 
house speaker thomas s foley jr told reporters the 
administration budget plan does not take major directions but 
added i believe we can and should reach a budget compromise 
bush said his fiscal blueprint keeps an eye toward future 
growth halving the federal deficit to 631 billion while 
building up government science space antidrug and environment 
efforts 
but majority democrats on capitol hill accused the president of 
being too kind to the pentagon despite diminishing tensions with 
the soviet union too stingy with domestic spending and overly 
dependent on phantom savings and unrealistic economic projections 
at a time when we need bold leadership what we have is 
another slideby budget panetta said 
while praising the presidents plan many republicans conceded 
fiscal 1991 which begins oct 1 poses so many difficult 
problems that budget work is likely to be timeconsuming and thorny 
i believe there is a real chance here of stalemate lamented 
sen pete domenici of new mexico the senate budget panels ranking 
republican 
bush proposed paring 365 billion from next years projected 
budget gap finding nearly half the savings by collecting 157 
billion in additional tax revenues bush revived his push to cut 
the capital gains tax rate which the senate denied him last year 
arguing it would raise 49 billion next year by encouraging 
property sales 
the new levies are partially offset by 18 billion in specific 
tax breaks including a 1000 credit to poor families for each 
child under 4 years old 
other savings would come from slashing domestic programs by more 
than 14 billion below the rate they would otherwise grow 
including 55 billion from medicare restraining growth in the 
military budget collecting new and higher user fees and leasing 
federal property 
we have taken pain to exclude gimmicks darman told 
reporters 
but democrats pointed to unspecified management savings of 
5 billion in the pentagon and 25 billion at the internal revenue 
service among other items 
they also grumbled that it assumed a brighter economy this year 
than many congressional and private analysts expect a factor that 
lets the government project higher revenue collections using the 
economic forecasts democrats consider accurate bushs budget would 
produce a 100 billion shortfall they said 
in other words theres no change in fiscal direction in this 
budget griped senate budget committee chairman james sasser 
dtenn 
bush presented his spending plan as one responsive to the 
dramatic changes in the world political situation 
he limited pentagon spending to 2921 billion higher than 
this years 2868 billion but 2 percent less than the total 
needed to stay even with inflation bush sought increases for 
expensive weapons systems such as 900 million more for the 
strategic defense initiative but a cutback of 38000 troops and 
the shutdown of dozens of military bases 
foley said the presidents defense budget would be reduced but 
would not specify an amount but he also predicted congress will 
not accept the administrations proposed freeze on costofliving 
increases for military and civilian retirees 
bush also hiked spending for foreign aid and other international 
expenditures to 182 billion a 12 percent boost that included 
300 million for eastern europe 
but democrats complained bush should have carved more out of the 
military 
youd think joe stalin had come back and entrenched himself in 
the kremlin sasser said 
bushs proposals to raise domestic spending read like a menu of 
his past campaign promises he sought a 12 billion hike to 76 
billion in environmental programs including an effort to plant 1 
billion trees annually 
federal antidrug efforts would increase from 69 billion to 
97 billion the head start preschool program for poor children 
would get a 500 million infusion to 19 billion and nasas 
budget would soar from 12 billion to 141 billion 
democratic staffers on the senate budget committee said they 
found 24 programs bush was proposing to eliminate including the 
economic development administration federal subsidies for the 
amtrak passenger railroad and energy conservation grants to state 
and local governments 
bush also proposed reducing spending for mass transit aid to 
communities several student loan programs and heating bill 
assistance for the poor 
the president also proposed a plan to gradually shift the 
massive social security surpluses out of the deficit calculations 
sen daniel moynihan dny has gained center stage by proposing 
to cut the retirement systems payroll tax

longer school days and thorough assessment of 
students at each grade level could improve education in the united 
states a new mexico senator said tuesday 
democrat jeff bingaman introduced bills to authorize a study on 
the feasibility of lengthening the school day and academic year and 
to create a council to keep tabs on the academic achievements of 
students and school quality 
it is time congress seriously considers how as a nation we 
will be prepared to face and succeed in the next century senate 
majority leader george mitchell dmaine said at a news conference 
with bingaman 
we have begun an era of technological sophistication that will 
require a welleducated workforce 
mitchell is cosponsoring the two bills with bingaman and sens 
edward kennedy dmass and tom harkin riowa 
bingaman chairman of the governmental affairs subcommittee on 
government information and regulation said there was a good chance 
the bills would get to the senate floor this session however he 
was uncertain they would reach the house 
the 200day school year study act would create a commission to 
review schoolday policies among states as well as the effect a 
longer school year would have on teacher salaries and on the 
communities paying those salaries 
i have long believed that the school year should be 
extended mitchell said 
american students he said attend school about 180 days per 
year while europeans typically attend 220 days the japanese 240 
days and south koreans 250 days per year 
the schoolyear commission also would design a plan to assist 
states and local school districts in meeting the additional costs 
associated with a longer school year 
education secretary lauro cavazos does not support longer school 
days bingaman said polls also indicate that the general public 
and students oppose longer school days he said 
that may not determine whether we ought to do it or not 
bingaman said adding that the studies may provide persuasive 
evidence 
the national report card act of 1990 would establish a council 
of experts to study make recommendations and periodically report 
on the status of the nations educational achievement from 
preschool through higher education 
a realistic assessment of educational quality and the 
establishment of national education goals is heavily dependent on 
the quality and availability of us educational statistics and 
information bingaman said

the arab leagues representative on tuesday 
urged the bush administration to reassess and toughen its policy 
against settlement of soviet jews in israelioccupied territories 
the soviet jewish immigration issue in bolstering israels 
intransigence and whetting its appetite for expansion must lead to 
a genuine reassessment of us policy clovis maksoud told a 
news conference 
israeli expectations of thousands of soviet immigrants a month 
represent an explosive situation and a new threat to middle 
east peace prospects he said 
the palestinian people cannot sit idly by and watch soviet 
jewish immigrants settling in israel as fullfledged citizens when 
palestinian refugees are systematically denied their inalienable 
right of return or their right to be compensated maksoud said 
the united states and the soviet union should realize the 
potential of this demographic explosion and convene a 
longdiscussed international conference on the middle east he 
said the united states has traditionally opposed the sovietbacked 
proposal for an international conference focusing its efforts on 
arranging direct israeliarab talks 
maksoud said state department statements about the settlement 
issue do not go far enough and the united states should return to 
its policy during the carter administration of considering 
settlements in the occupied territories illegal 
the reagan administration changed this to declaring settlement 
in the occupied territories as an obstacle to peace 
the state department said monday that us aid is limited to use 
inside israel and is forbidden for use in settling immigrants in 
the occupied territories 
maksoud said the arab countries question whether the aid is 
adequately monitored to prevent its use in the territories and 
said stronger verification is needed to keep israel from cheating 
on utilization of aid

a federal judge today ordered former president 
reagan to turn over excerpts of his diaries to former national 
security adviser john m poindexter for use in his irancontra case 
us district judge harold greene directed reagan to produce 
entries from the expresidents diaries for 29 different dates in 
1985 and 1986 
in addition poindexter is entitled to receive other diary 
excerpts said the judge he did not detail how many or what dates 
reagan was ordered to produce a diary entry relating to a 
successful trip poindexter took in december 1985 to central 
america 
the entry includes a somewhat ambiguous comment arguably 
indicating that the former president knew of poindexters 
activities on behalf of the contras greene said 
reagan was ordered to give poindexter the diary entries by next 
monday 
theodore olson one of reagans lawyers wasnt immediately 
available for comment his office said 
greene gave the former president nearly a week to produce the 
material in case he decides to assert the doctrine of executive 
privilege in an attempt to avoid surrendering the diaries 
the judge said poindexter is entitled to diary entries in which 
reagan describes an effort to persuade the government of honduras 
to release a seized arms shipment that had been destined for the 
nicaraguan contra rebels 
greene also said poindexter must receive diary entries focusing 
on us militarytype assistance to an unidentified central 
american country in support of the contras 
this occurred during a congressional ban on us military aid 
for the rebels fighting the leftist government of nicaragua 
poindexter is entitled to the entries because they may show 
what types of aid president reagan thought could legally be 
provided for the military or paramilitary operations of the 
contras greene said 
poindexter is charged with conspiracy two counts of obstructing 
congress and two counts of counts of making false statements in 
connection with oliver norths assistance to the contras and the 
1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
he is scheduled to go on trial feb 20 
poindexter also is entitled to reagans diary entries concerning 
meetings with poindexter and others in december 1985 to discuss 
the sales of arms to iran said the court ruling 
one diary entry addresses briefly the issue of the proceeds 
from these sales of arms to iran it said 
none of the diary entries sheds any light on the question of 
what president reagan may have know about the diversion of 
proceeds to the contra rebels from the administrations secret sale 
of arms to iran 
reagan has denied knowing about the diversion and poindexter 
testified to congress that he didnt tell the president 
greene said poindexter isnt entitled to a large number of diary 
entries that deal with the irancontra affair but arent relevant 
to the criminal case against the former national security adviser 
poindexter maintains that reagan knew of and approved activities 
undertaken in the iran and contra initiatives and that therefore he 
had no reason to conceal these activities from congress as charged 
in the indictment against him 
poindexter has said that reagan took notes at meetings focusing 
on congressional inquiries into whether north then a national 
security council aide was raising money and providing military 
advice to the contras 
the responses sent by poindexter embraced false denials about 
norths involvement that had been sent to congress in 1985 by 
robert mcfarlane poindexters predecessor as national security 
adviser 
we believe the presidents notes will show his discussions 
with admiral poindexter first about the letters that were sent by 
congress and the appropriateness of any response one of 
poindexters lawyers said in court last sept 6 
in addition poindexter has told the judge that his meetings 
with reagan also dealt with the accuracy of a chronology prepared 
by north on a 1985 shipment of hawk missiles to iran 
four of the criminal charges against poindexter deal with this 
false chronology and poindexters alleged statements to congress 
that he didnt know until 1986 that the november 1985 shipment 
contained hawk missiles

about 90 prospective jurors were 
summoned today for the trial of the fired exxon skipper charged in 
the nations worst oil spill 
superior court judge karl johnstone read the poetential jurors 
the charges then divided them into groups of 30 each to be 
questioned over three days 
former captain joseph hazelwood watched quietly in the courtroom 
where reporters outnumbered spectators until the jury pool filed 
in the potential jurors had filled out questionnaires in advance 
for the lawyers to study 
hazelwoods trial got under way monday with johnstone rejecting 
yet another effort to have charges against the veteran mariner 
dismissed 
but the judge did not rule on whether to bar key evidence 
results of a sobriety test that hazelwood had failed after the 
exxon valdez spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude oil 
in addition to the 12 jurors johnstone said three or four 
alternates probably will be selected 
hazelwood faces a felony charge of criminal mischief and 
misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment negligent discharge 
of oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated the maximum 
penalty for conviction on all counts is seven years three months 
in prison and 61000 in fines 
defense lawyer dick madson had told johnstone the charges should 
be dismissed because federal law preempts state law in the case 
i feel that this show should not go on at least not here 
madson said federal laws and regulations have covered this 
commercial shipping field for 200 years and theres a good 
reason for it madson said he said federal law prevails to 
guarantee consistent rules from port to port regardless of the 
state involved 
but johnstone denied madsons motion saying it lacked substance 
earlier defense efforts to get the indictment dismissed failed 
in various courts 
still pending is a defense motion to prohibit as evidence the 
results of a bloodalcohol test that hazelwood failed about 10 
hours after his ship struck a reef in prince william sound on march 
24 
the spill which blackened shores and killed wildlife triggered 
what exxon calculated was a 2 billion cleanup some state 
officials and others say the work is not over and should continue 
this spring and summer 
hazelwood is expected to be present throughout the trial which 
is to last six weeks or more 
johnstone told lawyers on both sides he expects jury selection 
to take less than the two weeks that lawyers predicted the judge 
warned he does not want the process to be drawn out with extensive 
questions about the candidates backgrounds 
the threepage questionnaire filled out by prospective jurors 
includes questions about experience with vessels work in the oil 
and fishing industries familiarity with the oil spill and personal 
economic loss or gain tied to the spill 
hazelwood originally was scheduled for an october trial in 
valdez the port from which the tanker set out a few hours before 
the crash the trial for the huntington ny seaman was moved to 
anchorage to increase the chance of a fair proceeding and to take 
advantage of a larger jury pool and court room

the army has a new panama emergency a 
shortage of decorations for infantrymen who saw combat in the dec 
20 invasion 
the deficit of the combat infantrymans badges came as five 
democratic senators tuesday urged the army to give the awards to 
women who were in combat in panama 
we understand the army is firm in its objection to women in 
combat said a letter initiated by sen howard metzenbaum dohio 
but women were in combat in panama and deserve full 
recognition of their accomplishments and courage in behalf of 
american people they should be given the combat infantrymans 
badge the senators said in a letter to army secretary michael 
tw stone 
others senators signing the letter were democrats kent conrad 
and quentin burdick of north dakota thomas daschle of south 
dakota and paul simon of illinois 
the army says the women who went to panama did not serve in 
infantry units but were assigned to noncombatant support units 
only infantry officers and enlisted soldiers who satisfactorily 
perform the infantry operations in active ground combat are 
eligible for the badges army regulations say 
meanwhile the army had made an expedited buy of 10000 
decorations from lordship industries in hauppauge ny said frank 
johnson a spokesman of the defense personnel support system in 
philadelphia 
the 3inch badges cost 90 cents each and are emblazoned with a 
wreath and a rifle some 2500 badges will be shipped to ford ord 
calif by march 3 to meet a shortage there 
the shortage cropped up because the army didnt anticipate the 
panama invasion in which 9000 of the roughly 26000 troops 
involved in the operation were infantrymen 
when we looked ahead we didnt anticipate needing the ones 
for panama said shari lawrence a spokeswoman for the army 
personnel command 
its a fairly routine thing lawrence said of the badge 
you dont have to have any valorous situation 
maj ld walker at fort ord said the badges were highly sought 
after by infantrymen who havent had many combat situations in 
recent years to qualify 
they dont have very much opportunity opportunity is maybe 
the wrong word to get those he said

this city at least thats what a new sign implies 
the sign a takeoff on the international symbol prohibiting 
something shows a bride and groom inside a circle with a slash 
through it but an official insisted tuesday the city is not 
antilove 
its a funky sign and we made it in a fun way said 
department of ports and trades spokesman frances resheske 
the sign recently went up on a public pier in the borough of 
queens after residents complained to their community board that the 
pier was frequently being closed for private weddings 
we didnt mean to imply that weddings are prohibited 
resheske said just that people are not allowed to close off the 
pier to the public 
she said many couples holding receptions at an adjacent 
restaurant were led to believe they could hold private ceremonies 
on the pier with a view of the manhattan skyline 
the restaurant has a lease allowing it to operate on city 
property but the rights do not extend to the pier resheske said 
the sign may be fun but the city isnt joking resheske said 
lovebirds who violate it could be fined up to 5000

politicians and statisticians disagreed 
tuesday on whether this years census can be made more accurate by 
adjusting the final numbers 
the census is a political act and there are winners and 
losers the losers say count differently and the winners say 
leave it alone observed rep william m thomas rcalif 
we count with about 98 percent accuracy but not perfection 
added thomas at a house census and population subcommittee hearing 
on proposed guidelines for deciding whether to adjust the count 
following the census this march and april 
the 1980 national head count missed about 32 million people 
often poor and minorities the census bureau has calculated 
efforts to reduce that undercount are underway but many people are 
still expected to be missed this year 
because census figures are used to apportion seats in congress 
and state legislatures the anticipated undercount led to a lawsuit 
filed by new york and other cities fearing loss of representation 
the lawsuit was settled by an agreement that the census bureau 
would develop guidelines for deciding if the final counts could be 
improved by some form of statistical adjustment 
a set of proposed guidelines was published in december and 
promptly drew fire from backers of making the adjustment who say 
the guidelines are too stringent 
in general the guidelines cite the basic census as a standard of 
accuracy and suggest changing the count only if it can be shown 
that the modifications would be even more accurate not just 
nationally but on local levels also in addition the guidelines 
would discourage adjustment if the process would result in 
confusion or disruption of the political process of undermine 
public confidence in the census numbers 
rep thomas c sawyer dohio was concerned that the guidelines 
appear to create a strong presumption against adjustment 
these guidelines cast grave doubts on the sincerity of the 
department of commerce barbara a bailer executive director of 
the american statistical association and a former census bureau 
official said in her prepared testimony 
and rep martin frost dtexas said that in his opinion the 
guidelines almost insure no adjustment 
the proposed guidelines so stack the deck against the 
possibility of correction that their adoption will be tantamount to 
a decision not to correct the differential undercount concluded 
new york attorney general robert abrams in his prepared testimony 
michael r darby commerce under secretary for economic affairs 
responded that the department hopes to take such an accurate census 
that adjustment wont be needed but if it is the guidelines are 
still under development and can be modified 
if the census bureau is going to part from its tradition of 
publishing figures based only on people actually counted it must 
have firm and noncontroversial ground to stand on v lance 
tarrance cochairman of the census advisory panel on adjustment 
said in his testomony 
arguments against adjustment seem to me stronger than the 
arguments for added william kruskal professor emeritus of 
statistics at the university of chicago 
proponents of adjustment believe that the data when 
available will show overwhelmingly that the counts can be improved 
by statistical adjustment skeptics like myself suspect that they 
will not concluded kenneth wachter of the university of 
california at berkeley

communist party chief petar mladenov 
fiercely attacked the ousted leadership tuesday but offered few 
ideas for change as he tried to please reformers and conservatives 
and avoid a party split 
as the party began a threeday congress mladenov proposed 
splitting the post of party chief and state president which he 
assumed when todor zhivkov was removed from 35 years in power nov 
10 
its my suggestion that the comrades adopt a decision that the 
same person should not be leading the party and the state at the 
same time mladenov told the 2752 delegates 
in his twohour opening speech mladenov tried to please 
reformers by talking in general terms of change while pandering to 
conservatives by giving little ground to the opposition 
but he had few fresh ideas on how to keep the party together and 
gave only halfhearted support to creation of a market economy he 
focused mainly on criticism of zhivkov 
debate during the afternoon showed divisions emerging between 
the conservative majority and the various reform factions who favor 
quicker moves toward democracy 
when one hardline delegate insisted i am against private 
ownership and do not accept the exploitation of man by man 
another called for removing party structures that generate 
totalitarian ways and rule and suggested changing the partys 
name 
the congress was originally not scheduled until 1991 but it was 
rescheduled after bulgaria was caught up in the prodemocracy 
movement sweeping eastern europe 
mladenov was at his most forthright in criticizing the 
35yearrule of zhivkov who on monday was said to have been moved 
from house arrest in a villa to prison pending trial on charges of 
misappropriation of state property inciting ethnic hostility and 
grave abuse of power 
bearer of a painful suspiciousness and selfishness of a manic 
ambition to be a theoretician in the complete absence of any kind 
of intellectual abilities he was unscrupulous and insidious 
mladenov said of zhivkov 
he accused the ousted leader of staging fake trials in attempts 
to fight his opponents with the most brutal terrorist means 
but he added those designs ultimately failed 
there has been speculation that mladenov who served as 
zhivkovs foreign minister for 17 years and is rumored to suffer 
from a heart condition might retain the presidency and allow 
someone else to take over the party 
but it was unclear tuesday whether another holdover from the 
zhivkov era reformer andrei lukanov could win the post or 
whether bulgarias communists will follow other east european 
parties and bring new blood into the leadership in an attempt to 
boost the partys standing 
opposition leaders and some reform communists doubt the current 
ruling group mladenov lukanov and politburo member alexander 
lilov are sincere about genuine change 
one of the few rounds of applause for mladenov came when he 
rejected opposition calls to postpone the nations first free 
parliamentary elections in more than 40 years mladenov insisted 
they be held not later than may 
the opposition had sought a postponement until november to give 
it time to organize against the still powerful communists 
mladenov appeared to try to exploit divisions within the still 
weak opposition by reiterating calls for a new government of 
national concord before the elections 
some opposition leaders have rejected this idea outright saying 
they do not want to be responsible for the chaos caused by four 
decades of communist rule others have suggested they might 
participate in such an interim cabinet 
both east germany and czechoslovakia whose communist parties 
have collapsed far faster than bulgarias are now governed by such 
coalition cabinets pending free elections 
bulgarias communists drawing on a century of tradition and 
facing a relatively weak opposition have relinquished far less 
power than their comrades in other states 
mladenov warned the delegates they could lose more power if the 
party does not reform but he said little to indicate he has 
concrete plans for change 
mladenov admitted the economy is in tatters but he was 
vague on how to improve it while saying the economy should be 
marketoriented and allow for mixed forms of ownership he said 
this does not mean and cannot mean capitalist orientation 
all the countrys mines were on strike last week an 
unprecedented wave of labor stoppages in postwar bulgaria 
mladenov also gave no specifics on what share of power the 
communists would retain in a government of national accord 
to date the communists have balked at such relatively simple 
opposition demands as a share in radio and television broadcasts

adviser to quayle one of the administrations most conservative 
members the vice president said he wanted to contact him because 
of carters experience in the region 
i wanted to talk to him about latin american politics he 
spent a great deal of time traveling around and also converse with 
him a little bit about the situation in nicaragua i was interested 
in his view of my trip and what i might expect and his 
assessment quayle said 
carter has been welcomed by the nicaraguan government as an 
independent observer of the feb 25 elections managua has refused 
to allow a congressional delegation that president bush wants to 
send 
while the bush administration has repeatedly criticized the 
ruling sandinistas for trying to choke the oppositions chances in 
the election carter said monday he believes the voting will be 
fair and honest

of reductions in some of the cities major programs 
we dont know who wrote it the list but mayors are 
concerned they have been singled out thomas cochran the 
organizations executive director told a news conference 
cochran referred to a chapter in the bush budget delivered to 
congress on monday the chapter titled reducing investment in 
lowreturn programs calls for spending cuts in mass transit 
sewage plants housing subsidies student aid lowincome energy 
assistance and other urban programs 
cochran said the message in the new budget is that urban 
programs which have been reduced 62 percent in the last 10 years 
will be cut again if bush prevails in congress 
a proposed 163 million cut from the 29 billion authorized in 
fiscal 1990 for the community development grant program 
particularly was a serious slap in the face he said because 
it is the only major federal urban program remaining 
cochran said the conference would get our forces together to 
persuade cognress not to go along with the idea 
at the same time the conference official satres 
good luck and keep puzzling the voice says before signing 
off 
the calls cost 75 cents for the first minute 50 cents for every 
additional minute 
nancy nielson a spokeswoman for the times said the 
experimental service has been offered since jan 21 and may lead to 
other interactive services sponsored by the newspaper she said 
there had not yet been any accounting of how many calls the service 
had received 
there is one small quirk in the system puzzlers who called 
tuesday were able to get answers to wednesdays asyetunseen 
puzzle by punching in the date 131 if you get stuck 1 down is

the chairman of the democratic party has 
rejected president bushs appeal for contributions to the campaign 
of violeta chamorro to be president of nicaragua 
we are not about to become a political action committee for 
nonamerican candidates party chairman ronald h brown wrote to 
bush in a letter made public tuesday 
brown said the democrats supported bushs request for a 9 
million congressional appropriation to help chamorros campaign 
against nicaraguan president daniel ortega 
the democratic party and its leaders in congress share your 
hope that a free and fair electoral process in nicaragua will help 
that wartorn nation reconcile its differences and achieve peace 
brown wrote bush 
but said brown i fear that your jan 24 appeal could be 
interpreted as an attempt to politicize this issue in a harmful 
way democrats do not believe that it is appropriate proper or 
wise for our political parties to attempt to influence the outcome 
of elections in a foreign country 
recalling that bush once served as republican party chairman 
brown said you will well understand my own determination to use 
the resources of my party to elect democrats here at home 
in letters to the republican and democratic national committees 
bush said that mrs chamorro and her party the national opposition 
union or uno were desparately short of funds needed for 
campaign rallies distributing campaign literature and media time 
the nicaraguan election is scheduled for feb 25 
bush said the sandinista government had imposed serious 
obstacles to the delivery of funds appropriated by congress and 
to date uno has been permitted to make use of only a tiny 
fraction of them for these reasons mrs chamorros campaign runs 
the real risk of being crippled for lack of money 
the president urged the two us parties to make an unspecified 
joint contribution and urge their individual contributors to do the 
same

a ruling on deposed panamanian dictator manuel 
noriegas claim that he cant be tried on drug charges because he 
is a prisoner of war has been delayed a week court officials said 
tuesday 
us district judge william hoeveler had planned a status 
conference thursday on that issue and bond questions for two 
noriega codefendants but on tuesday reset the hearing for feb 8 
the department of justice is preparing a response to the pow 
claim said david runkel chief spokesman for the attorney general 
in washington 
noriegas trial on 1988 drugtrafficking charges is scheduled 
for march 5 but noriegas attorneys have repeatedly said it will 
be postponed 
the defense claims a federal judge has no jurisdiction in the 
case because under the geneva convention noriega was captured 
during armed hostilities and is therefore a pow 
hoeveler has expressed skepticism 
just because he is found to be a prisoner of war would not 
rule out the governments ability to bring him to trial hoeveler 
said during a bond hearing monday for codefendants luis del cid 
and daniel miranda 
noriega lawyers frank rubino and steven kollin have said they 
are seeking to take the pow issue before an international forum 
possibly the world court at the hague netherlands 
since sunday noriega has been held at the federal metropolitan 
correctional center in southwest dade county noriega is under 
24hour guard and kept separate from all other prisoners 
he spends 23 hours a day in an 86squarefoot cell equipped with 
a bed wash basin toilet and a table he is allowed into a 
15by15foot metal cage for one hour a day to exercise prison 
spokesman charles davis said 
he can play handball against a wall or walk around or do 
calisthenics davis said but he wont be engaged in any team

proposed legislation that would clear the way 
for industrywide standards on television sex and violence might 
violate constitutional guarantees of free speech a broadcaster 
said tuesday 
such standards could lead to areas in which the government is 
more or less directing us as to how we should treat various 
subjects said charles e sherman senior vice president of the 
national association of broadcasters 
what then happens if another cause arises why then couldnt 
another senator indicate that he thinks television should be more 
positive sherman asked 
shermans comments came at a roundtable discussion prompted by 
the results of a threeyear audit of television violence and 
legislation proposed by sen paul simon dill to restore some of 
the industrys ability for selfregulation 
there are still legal scholars and people who feel that we 
would be subjected to first amendment suits because we are indeed 
following government directions in trying to come up with standards 
on violence sherman said 
the nab he said had to defend the governmentmandated family 
viewing hour in lawsuits brought during the 1970s by unions for 
both writers and directors who felt the restriction violated free 
speech guarantees 
violence in television is changing our society and not for the 
better said simon urging the industry to develop its own 
standards he said his bill the television violence and indecent 
material act would allow that 
the audit released tuesday part of a 22year continuing study 
developed a television violence profile of programming on the three 
major networks from 19861989 
the study said 70 percent of primetime programs use violence 
with between five and six violent acts per viewing hour half of 
all primetime dramatic characters are involved in violence 
according to the study 
the report was most critical of childrens weekend daytime 
programming saying it remains saturated with violence 
in each of the past three seasons children were entertained 
with more than 25 acts of mostly humorous violence per hour 
committed by more than seven out of 10 characters in nine out of 10 
programs the study said 
simon has proposed granting limited antitrust immunity for 
three years to television broadcasters networks cable 
television local stations producers and industry trade groups 
to allow them to develop and apply written guidelines on tv 
violence in entertainment programs 
the bill is stalled in a housesenate conference committee 
because of an amendment included by sen jesse helms rnc to 
broaden its authority to guidelines on depictions of televised 
sexual activity 
beth w bressan who oversees program standards and commercial 
clearance for cbs said the legislation wasnt necessary because it 
is unclear how harmful or undesirable television violence is to 
viewers 
last year cbs received more than 600000 pieces of mail 
bressnan said of that we had 92 viewers complaining that there 
was too much violence 
congress might do better to deal with the ills of society and 
the violence of the climate in society rather than trying to clean 
up the reflection of that society said zev braun producer of the 
toprated series on the vietnam war tour of duty which 
includes graphic violence

sen daniel patrick moynihan on tuesday 
pitched his plan to cut social security taxes to the nations 
largest senior citizen group disputing president bushs claims 
that the plan would lead to benefit cuts 
the new york democrat said the financial soundness of the system 
would be protected under his proposal to reduce the payroll tax to 
stop the government from using surplus social security revenues to 
pay for other programs 
there would be no risk to benefits at any time he told the 
american association of retired persons we are having the system 
perform just as it was originally intended to do 
but at the white house treasury secretary nicholas brady 
assailed moynihans proposal as the height of folly 
brady said americans have faith in the social security system as 
it currently works people dont talk about it they think the 
money is there in the social security trust funds 
he says because of the surplus you can reduce the taxes i 
say thats goofy brady said at a white house briefing 
moynihans concern is that social securitys growing trust fund 
reserves are being used to mask the true size of the federal 
deficit and to pay for other government programs his solution is 
to halt the buildup of the reserves and return social security to a 
payasyougo system in which taxes would be raised in the next 
century to finance retirement benefits paid out then 
moynihan said that if the government continues to use the trust 
funds for other purposes it could cause a loss of trust that could 
be a seismic event 
this has the makings of a massive loss of trust he said 
moynihan said the government should be forced to stop using 
social security revenues for other purposes before it becomes 
inextricably dependent on them 
now is the moment to do it moynihan said you wait five 
years and they will have a 3 billionaweek habit 
moynihan rejected the bush administrations rival proposal to 
gradually shift the social security surpluses out of the deficit 
calculations saying it puts off dealing with the problem 
the senator addressed the aarps national legislative council 
which has not yet taken a position on his proposal speaking to 
reporters after his speech moynihan indicated that his taxcut 
plan may become intertwined in congress with the presidents 
proposed cut in the capital gains tax 
if a capital gains tax comes to the floor of the united states 
senate theres going to be an amendment he said

a floria lawyer accused of conspiracy 
in the kidnapping of socialite annie laurie hearin had blamed ms 
hearins husband for the loss of his property a prosecutor said in 
opening statements today 
assistant us attorney patricia bennett also said a man 
resembling defendant newton alfred winn of st petersburg was seen 
in ms hearins neighborhood in a white van a week before her 
kidnapping 
she said the evidence will also show he wasnt seen by family 
and friends in florida between july 23 and 28 1988 
winn 65 says he is innocent and was in st petersburg when 
mrs hearin was abducted from her jackson home july 26 1988 mrs 
hearin then 72 has not been found 
mrs hearins husband robert m hearin is among mississippis 
wealthiest people with investments in oil gas and banking his 
fortune is estimated at 100 million 
a note discovered in the foyer of the hearin home listed 12 
people including winn who had been involved in legal battles with 
school pictures inc a business in which hearin had been a 
stockholder 
bennett charged that winn held hearin responsible for a 1983 
lawsuit filed by school pictures against him as a result winns 
property was seized and sold in october 1986 
winn is charged with conspiracy to kidnap mailing a threatening 
letter and perjury if convicted on all charges he faces up to 
life in prison 
no one has been charged with carrying out the kidnapping itself 
theres another side to the story defense attorney ed 
marger argued today in this case the evidence will explicitly 
show that the government cannot show that my client is guilty 
before opening statements marger argued for admission of tape 
recordings that he said contain evidence of misconduct by an fbi 
agent and robert hearin jr the missing womans son 
they are sensational because they reflect a relationship 
between the hearin family and the fbi that is improper marger 
said 
assistant us attorney james tucker said intercepting and 
recording conversations is illegal and that the law prohibits the 
tapes from being used 
it doesnt matter that it was a cellular phone tucker said 
that just makes it a misdemeanor 
us district judge tom lee said he needed to research the law 
before ruling on the request but returned the tapes to the defense 
saying the wiretap law apparently doesnt apply 
hearin mailed checks totaling nearly 1 million to the 12 people 
named in the ransom note winn returned his 145000 check 
winn is accused of arranging for a second ransom note to hearin 
the letter in mrs hearins handwriting said her captors would 
seal her in a cellar if the nearly 1 million was not paid to the 
12 former franchise holders of school pictures of mississippi 
hearin paid the money after the second letter arrived at his 
home

talks between secretary of state james a 
baker iii and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze have 
been postponed a day because of a meeting of the communist party 
central committee the state department said today 
baker and shevardnadze will meet feb 89 in the soviet capital 
at the suggestion of the us government said state department 
spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler they had planned to hold their 
talks feb 78 
the oneday delay was announced as cable news network reported 
that mikhail s gorbachev was considering resigning as chief of the 
communist party while retaining his post as soviet president 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said of the cnn report 
i have no idea weve never heard of it before i have no 
information 
cnn in a report from moscow quoted a wellinformed and 
usually reliable communist party source as saying gorbachev may 
try to leave his closest ally alexander yakovlev in charge of the 
communist party while he follows popular pressure to remove the 
party from its monopoly control of political power 
ms tutwiler said of the delay in the bakershevardnadze talks 
it simply makes more sense to have the soviets complete their 
plenum before beginning this important ministerial 
the issues to be discussed in the talks include arms control and 
the war in afghanistan between the sovietbacked government and 
usarmed rebels

maverick christian gen michel aoun 
ordered his troops tuesday to take over all bases of a rival 
militia as the sides prepared to fight for control of the christian 
heartland 
police said five combatants were wounded when aouns 8th brigade 
stormed a major barracks of the lebanese forces the christians 
main militia in east beirut 
crack commandos of the 8th brigade trained by us marines in 
1983 seized the militias tahwita barracks in the residential 
district of furn elshubbak after a 90minute firefight a police 
statement said 
the army claimed militiamen shot down several posters of aoun 
with rocketpropelled grenades in the lowincome neighborhood and 
then took shelter in the base 
troops seized the tahwita barracks and rounded up the 
outlaws said a police statement issued in east beirut it did 
not give the number of arrests 
it said four of the injured were lebanese forces militiamen and 
one an aoun soldier all were hospitalized 
aoun in a statement issued on his radio lebanon station said 
he had ordered his 20000 troops to take over all other barracks of 
the 6000strong lebanese forces militia throughout the christian 
enclave 
no militia barracks are allowed henceforth to remain in the 
eastern area aouns statement said anyone who wants to carry 
arms should join the army the country cannot be rebuilt if it 
still has militias 
the declaration suggested a longexpected showdown was imminent 
between aoun and the lebanese forces commander samir geagea the 
only christian warlord with the potential to challenge aouns 
authority in the enclave 
the lebanese forces have four major bases controlling the 
enclaves 30mile mediterranean coast 
voice of free lebanon radio said geagea was holding crisis talks 
with senior aides in an effort to defuse the confrontation

enclave in the metn and upper regions as well as all inlets from 
west beirut the northern district of batroun and the central 
mountains 
aoun moved against the lebanese forces in february last year

syrianbacked moslem militiamen skirmished intermittently with 
automatic fire across beiruts dividing green line police said

elshubbak and the adjacent residential districts of ein 
elrummaneh and sinn elfil in east beirut by nightfall 
there was no word whether the troops would push against the 
lebanese forces main strongholds in and around jounieh 
rumors have been sweeping east beirut recently about mounting 
differences between aoun and the lebanese forces both geagea and 
aoun have repeatedly denied such reports despite their open 
disagreement over recognizing president elias hrawi as head of 
state 
geagea recognizes hrawi elected president nov 24 under an arab 
leaguebrokered plan to end lebanons 14yearold civil war 
aoun however has rejected the peace accord because it does not 
include a deadline for the withdrawal of syrian troops from 
lebanon he also refused to recognize hrawis election

the bush administration joined human rights 
activists tuesday in pushing for senate ratification of a un 
convention banning torture but the ranking republican on the 
foreign relations committee expressed reservations about the 
measure 
abraham d sofaer the state departments legal adviser told 
the foreign relations committee the administration places a high 
priority on early ratification of this important human rights 
treaty for substantive as well as symbolic reasons 
while the convention breaks little new ground and would be 
unnecessary in the united states sofaer said it would put the 
united states in the forefront of the issue 
nevertheless sofaer said the united states would insist on some 
protective measures in the convention which makes all acts of 
torture criminal offenses and requires parties to extradite those 
accused of torture 
a twothirds vote of the senate is required for ratification 
but the foreign relations committee must first vote on the issue 
sen jesse helms rnc said he wanted to hold more 
discussions with the administration before a vote is scheduled 
nobody favors torture helms said while at the same time 
raising questions about the convention 
he said he was disturbed that countries such as afghanistan 
bulgaria china and the soviet union have ratified the convention 
countries helms said have promoted serious human rights abuses 
rhetorically he wondered if parties to the convention had 
condemned china for the massacre of students last summer in 
beijing i guess running over people with tanks is not torture 
he said 
the convention has been ratified by 55 nations including libya 
a nation the united states has accused of promoting terrorism 
quizzed about libyas membership sofaer said the united states 
would use the convention as a forum to promote change in places 
such as libya 
twentytwo nations have signed the treaty indicating they 
intend to ratify it 
the torture convention came into force on june 26 1987 under 
the convention a committee of 10 experts was established with 
power to investigate allegations of torture and receive reports 
a number of human rights and other groups have supported the 
convention among them amnesty international the us catholic 
conference bnai brith international and the american bar 
association 
us adherence to the convention against torture is of 
unquestioned importance said winston p nagan the chairman of 
amnesty international

an unusually elusive pair of bandits dubbed 
bonnie and clyde have led police on a frustrating chase around 
new england allegedly robbing 27 stores and tying up clerks at 
knifepoint in the past five weeks 
but the duos age makes them more like bonnie and clydes 
parents 
police are seeking edward m aranjo 46 and ellen m marks 50 
in the spree which grew to 27 with two robberies monday no one 
has been injured 
in the mode of operation typical of all the crimes a 
middleaged couple threatened a 68yearold woman with a knife and 
tied her to a pipe monday before robbing her franklin bookstore 
cash register of 130 
that night a burlington video store was robbed and bonnie and 
clyde were the prime suspects again phone lines were cut and a 
male clerk was held at knifepoint and tied up the pair reportedly 
escaped with 160 in cash and 1500 worth of instant lottery 
tickets 
their pictures are out there on tv so maybe they just want to 
go for it before they throw in the towel said police capt alan 
leach of coventry ri one of dozens of police detectives 
tracking the case all we know is theyre moving awfully fast 
police believe theyre moving in a stolen car with massachusetts 
plates 
leach said he saw the pair referred to as bonnie and clyde in a 
police teletype message 
since dec 26 when a west warwick ri store was robbed of 
65 aranjo and marks are alleged to have robbed small shops in 
connecticut new york rhode island new hampshire and 
massachusetts 
the pair believed responsible for all of the crimes have rarely 
taken off more than two days between heists police said they are 
believed to sometimes dye their hair and wear hats and sunglasses 
but otherwise they are not heavily disguised police said 
their biggest take so far has been 400 in the town of 
attleboro 
theyre sure not going for a million dollars at one fell 
swoop said leach 
he believes they have holed up in a series of motel rooms and 
rooming houses in eastern massachusetts moving at least 15 times 
in the last two months 
typically the robberies have occurred at small stores with just 
a single clerk said police detective kevin slattery of framingham 
where a store was hit jan 8 he said the male member of the team 
has brandished a large hunting knife 
leach said aranjo has a lengthy criminal record including

pam jones huddled under a 
tattered umbrella on a muddy patch outside this us air base 
where women have kept up an antinuclear vigil for nearly nine 
years 
the base is to be closed in 1991 a symbol of the changing face 
of europe but ms jones isnt leaving yet well see it through 
to the end no one will ever forget greenham common she said 
tuesday 
surrounded by a dismal clutter of broken chairs plastic 
sheeting and the dying embers of a fire she said its a time of 
celebration 
greenham common has been a us base for nearly 50 years its 
where gen dwight d eisenhower saw off his dday invasion troops 
and it has been a rallying point for the antinuclear movement 
since it became a base for cruise missiles 
it is one of 14 foreign military installations that us defense 
secretary dick cheney is proposing to close in a costcutting 
measure 
cheneys announcement monday was a blow to many of the local 
people in the wealthy conservative berkshire countryside around 
greenham common 50 miles west of london the base employs nearly 
200 britons and spends 40 million a year locally 
well miss the americans economically and well miss them as 
people said ted ashton chatting in the ploughman a local pub 
when you play poker you deal from strength and thats what 
the americans did here and it worked said ashton 68 its all 
been worthwhile 
mostly the locals disdain the dozens of women who since 1981 
have protested outside the base but they more or less learned to 
put up with them 
they also became used to the cruise missiles trundling on 
cumbersome launchers through the country lanes on exercises that 
became known as walkies 
the big peace demonstrations of the 1980s when greenham common 
was the focus of antinuclear protest in western europe are just a 
memory 
the protesters theyre an absolute nuisance and theyve 
achieved nothing said ashton 
but ms jones 35 a former secretary with a punk haircut who 
first camped at greenham common three years ago thinks the 
protests and her vigil have been worthwhile women have gained 
enormous strength here and it will always be a symbol of the peace 
movement she said 
half the 110 cruise missiles deployed at greenham common have 
gone since the signing of the 1987 ussoviet agreement to 
eliminate mediumrange nuclear missiles from europe the rest will 
be out by mid1991 
after that under the new pentagon proposals greenham common 
will become a standby base nonoperational with about 400 
american personnel compared with 1645 now 
a local movement is campaigning to transform the 1046acre base 
into a park 
left behind will be the concrete bunkers part of the missiles 
105 million home the vip lounges spruced up for the soviet 
inspectors who drop by under the 1987 treaty and a long history 
the united states took over the airfield during world war ii 
and from here eisenhower the supreme allied commander broadcast 
to forces braced for the invasion of nazioccupied europe on june 
5 1944 the eyes of the world are upon you tonight he told 
them 
the women first pitched camp here in 1981 and 200 were living 
at the bases eight gates when the first cruise missiles to be 
deployed in western europe arrived at greenham common in november 
1983 
they became not just a peace movement but a focal point of 
militant feminism from which men are excluded 
a halfdozen remain as some move on others come staying for a 
few days or a few years thousands of women have lived at greenham 
through rain sleet and sunshine they still break into the base 
climb aboard the missile launchers or lie down in front of them 
hundreds have gone to prison for refusing to pay fines for 
damage or obstruction 
it has been a long standoff between the us troops and the 
women 
i wouldnt say either side has won said lt mike rein the 
air force spokesman at greenham common they have the issues they 
stand for and we have ours

the pilot of the avianca flight that 
crashed and killed 73 people had complete discretion in determining 
whether his boeing 707 was in a fuel emergency and needed to land 
immediately an investigator said tuesday 
barry trotter of the national transportation safety board the 
investigator in charge of the crash probe said avianca does not 
require pilots to declare a fuel emergency when levels drop below a 
certain point he said 
officials at american airlines and pan american world airways 
which both had flights diverted from kennedy international airport 
the night of the crash said the final decision on fuel emergencies 
on their flights rested with the pilot 
a possible miscommunication between controllers has been raised 
in the crash although federal officials defended the controllers 
on monday a final report on the cause of the crash is not expected 
for nine to 12 months 
investigators said monday that tapes show the crew warned 
regional air traffic controllers that their fuel was low as they 
circled over new jersey about 45 minutes before the crash 
that information was not explicitly relayed to the local 
controllers who were to guide the plane to kennedy the plane 
apparently ran out of gas and slammed into a hillside thursday on 
new yorks long island the captain laureano caviedes hoyes was 
one of the 73 people killed eightysix people survived 
the captain also asked for priority to land rather than 
declaring an emergency in telling the controller he could only 
stay in hold for another five minutes 
trotter said the controllers responded to the priority request 
by moving the flight from a holding pattern to an approach pattern 
although the plane was not moved to the first slot among 
approaching planes the planes 37minute wait during approach was 
not unusual due to the heavy traffic and bad weather he said 
ultimately its the captain although its the function of 
interaction between the crew said pan am spokesman jeff 
kriendler 
an american airlines jet was brought in shortly before the crash 
when its pilot told controllers it had just 14 minutes of fuel 
remaining american spokeswoman mary oneill said its the 
pilots final say 
pilots who land without adequate reserve fuel are liable to be 
called on the carpet by the airlines or by federal authorities 
trotter said 
the federal aviation administration reported that in the two 
hours before the crash 13 arriving planes experienced delays 
averaging 89 minutes at jfk and 33 planes were diverted to other 
airports winds reached 70 mph and windshear warnings were up 
the pilot had 17 years experience flying into kennedy including 
three trips the month before the tragedy trotter said 
but the air traffic controller he spoke with at the regional 
control center had just over six months fulllevel experience he 
said the other controllers involved at kennedy and two other sites 
had an average of eight years experience trotter said 
the ntsb planned to send investigators to colombia this week to 
review maintenance records and gather other information about the 
plane trotter said 
trotter said foreign avianca pilots must meet certain 
requirements in speaking and understanding english before they can 
fly in the united states

white house budget director richard g darman 
on tuesday defended president bushs 123 trillion budget against 
democratic criticism of gimmickry and rosy predictions and tried to 
snuff out a movement to cut social security taxes 
there are far fewer gimmicks such as shifting payments from 
one year to another to make the deficit look smaller than in past 
budgets darman told the house budget committee 
i think everyone of them in the new budget is defensible 
he said 
as for projections of greater economic growth and less inflation 
than private economists are forecasting darman pointed to the 
administrations figures from july as amazingly accurate 
you are not dealing with people who are totally out of 
bounds he said 
darman spent most of the day before the committee listening to 
democratic members complain that the budget which bush sent to 
congress on monday does not reflect a changing world because it 
proposes 2921 billion for the military in the fiscal year that 
begins oct 1 
youve blown the opportunity for economic growth by spending 
more on military said rep barbara boxer dcalif 
she said the administration proposal to save money starting in 
1994 by eliminating several military bases was an effort to 
intimidate lawmakers who might prefer less spending for defense 
why are some kinds of cuts good but other kinds are not 
darman asked 
darman was peppered with questions about social security 
specifically a bill by sen daniel patrick moynihan dny that 
bill which has drawn the interest of several lawmakers but 
opposition from the administration would cut payroll taxes as a 
way to keep the government from using surplus social security taxes 
to finance other federal programs 
it is my personal opinion that he moynihan never intended 
the plan to be taken as seriously as the press has taken it 
darman said implying that moynihan was simply trying to draw 
attention to the practice of using social security taxes for 
purposes other than providing benefits to retirees 
rep leon panetta dcalif chairman of the committee 
interjected i get the impression that he is quite serious about 
the proposal 
at the white house treasury secretary nicholas f brady told 
reporters moynihans proposal is the height of folly and 
goofy 
bushs budget proposes that once the federal deficit is 
eliminated and predicts that will be in 1993 social security 
taxes that are not needed to pay benefits immediately be used only 
to retire government debt 
darman bristled when rep james slattery dkan said social 
security is the biggest lie we have told the american people in 
maybe this generation calling bushs proposed remedy another 
scam another scam 
youre saying that federal debt is no good that we are 
bankrupt darman said the day that us treasuries 
securities are no good is a day i think none of us will ever see 
our proposal is not smoke and mirrors it will really get the 
debt down there isnt a trace of dishonesty in this 
presentation 
rep bill frenzel of minnesota senior republican on the budget 
committee threw darman one of the few bouquets during the hearing 
i happen to think it the budget is a pretty good 
beginning he said 
panetta said he found more gimmicks in the budget than darman 
acknowledged 
if the president is not serious about confronting the deficit 
issue why should congress be serious panetta asked 
of course the president is serious darman retorted i am 
serious i wish you had taken that on faith 
as for gimmicks he said he has a list of more than 100 that 
congress has used to reduce the deficit 
the new budget anticipates a 631 billion deficit in fiscal 
1991 although congressional economists say the figure is likely to 
approach 100 billion the budget would rely on spending 
reductions user fees and selected tax increases but no general 
boost in income taxes to cut the deficit from the 1990 level of 
about 124 billion 
i dont see a single tough choice in your budget said rep 
charles schumer dny at a time when this president has the 
political support to push through a radically changed budget 
he just sort of walks away from it 
rep james oberstar dminn said the budget reflects a view 
of america that is not shared by a lot of people in my district 
theres more to what we are doing than perhaps your 
constituents know darman replied

washington ap to hear some members of congress tell it 
president bushs no new taxes budget may have just set the 
stage for a 20 billion tax increase this year 
as the administration launched a defense of its tax and spending 
blueprint tuesday various influential democrats said they viewed 
the bush budget as an open invitation to raise taxes given the fact 
that bush included a number of revenue raisers in his own 
budget 
both house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif and 
senate budget committee chairman james sasser dtenn said they 
were willing to accept bushs proposal to raise revenues by 217 
billion but they said that congress was likely to radically alter 
the mix on how that money was obtained 
that revenue figure in total is something that we an accept 
sasser said unfortunately in bushs budget it is not 
legitimately achieved 
while the president proclaimed that his 1991 spending plan would 
slash the deficit in half without raising taxes the budget 
actually included a hodgepodge of increases in taxes and user fees 
that would bring in an additional 217 billion in the 1991 fiscal 
year which starts next october 
the bush budget proposes 157 billion in new tax revenue which 
is offset by 18 billion in tax cuts 
in addition the president proposes raising 56 billion in new 
user fees charged for providing government services 16 billion 
in the sale of government assets and 600 million in other new 
receipts bringing the total to 217 billion 
critics of the bush budget charge that the administration has 
recycled a variety of proposals many dating back to the reagan 
administration that congress has rejected in the past 
one retread is a proposal to assess federal social security 
taxes on state and local government employees in the handful of 
states who are not now covered by the levy a 38 billion revenue 
raiser that bush unsuccessfully sought last year 
other proposed revenue increases would extend the soontoexpire 
3 percent tax on long distance telephone calls increase the tax on 
airline tickets from 8 percent to 10 percent and pick up 25 
billion by beefed up enforcement at the internal revenue service 
bushs biggest revenue raiser for next year is actually a tax 
cut the proposed reduction in the capital gains tax the levy on 
profits made from the sale of assets such as stocks or real estate 
bush estimates that would bring in 49 billion in additional 
money in 1991 as people rushed to sell assets to take advantage of 
the lower tax but critics charge that the proposal would lose 
money in later years because of the lower tax bite 
panetta suggested that congress might consider compromising on 
the capital gains cut sought by bush if the president was willing 
to consider tax increases in other areas possibly a higher top tax 
rate for individuals or a boost in energy taxes 
treasury secretary nicholas brady told reporters tuesday that 
the administration was optimistic about the chances for getting a 
reduction in capital gains passed this year after failing to do so 
in 1988 
all of the comments i have heard by returning congressmen and 
senators indicate to me that they think it has even a better 
chance this year brady said 
but complicating the tax debate this year is a rival plan by 
sen daniel moynihan dny to slash social security taxes by 62 
billion in 1990 and 1991 by rolling back two scheduled rate 
increases 
brady speaking to reporters at the white house said the 
administration would not support moynihans proposal as part of a 
bargain to get the capital gains tax cut approved and he assailed 
moynihans proposal as goofy 
brady said that americans have faith in the social security 
system as it currently works 
people dont talk about it they think the money is there in 
the social security trust funds brady said terming moynihans 
proposal to return the surplus to taxpayers as the height of 
folly 
he says because of the surplus you can reduce the taxes i 
say thats goofy brady said 
if bush does accept revenue increases as part of the 
negotiations over his new budget it would not be the first time 
last november as part of a deal to reach an agreement on a budget 
for the current fiscal year bush accepted almost 8 billion in tax 
increases and nearly 2 billion in tax cuts for a net tax increase 
of 6 billion 
the agreement was part of a 147 billion package of measures 
including spending cuts to reduce the size of the 1990 deficit 
currently estimated at 1238 billion

accused azerbaijani leaders of not taking strong enough action to 
prevent ethnic violence in the southern republic 
vyacheslav a mikhailov the no 2 official at the party central 
committees ethnic relations department said azerbaijani officials

azerbaijani peoples front the grassroots political group that

extremists and denounced them but instead granted them 
concession after concession 
the moscow official also said some members of azerbaijans law 
enforcement agencies did not adopt the best form of behavior 
he did not elaborate 
some armenian refugees from baku have claimed police did nothing 
to stop terrorists from attacking them

the state department on tuesday accused the 
ruling national salvation front in romania of intimidating the 
political opposition and said the departments human rights 
director richard schifter was in bucharest forcefully stating 
our concerns 
alan green jr the us ambassador to romania lodged a protest 
and asked that the right of all political groups to peaceful 
protests be fully protected margaret d tutwiler a department 
spokeswoman said 
we will be greatly saddened if the hope for democracy and 
human rights won at such great human cost in romania were to be 
lost by a retreat to the habits and practices of an old 
totalitarian era that should be completely discarded she said 
the front in power since the ouster dec 22 of nicolae 
ceausescu has organized massive demonstrations in bucharest in 
response to a protest sunday by three opposition parties the 
progovernment demonstrators have demanded the dissolution of the 
opposition peasants party and liberal party 
we are deeply troubled by what appears to be active 
intimidation of legitimate organizations which are seeking a 
legitimate independent role in romanias new political order 
ms tutwiler said 
the stern statement was the latest in a series criticizing 
actions by the front so far the state department has not directly 
challenged either its authority or the justice system in romania 
which led to the summary execution of ceausescu and his wife 
elena and the trial now underway of ousted hardliners 
on monday richard boucher a state department spokesman said 
antifront demonstrators were protesting the predominance of 
communists in the provisional government and the fronts recent 
decision to run candidates in elections scheduled for may 20 
there should be no backsliding on the part of transitional 
officials as romania moves from revolution to democracy boucher 
said 
in tuesdays statement ms tutwiler credited the government with 
taking significant strides toward democracy and respect for 
human rights 
she said however that many of the groups opposed to the 
government apparently fear it is intent on stealing the 
revolution from the democratic forces which ousted ceausescu in 
order to perpetuate communism in romania 
while the bucharest government has postponed the elections from 
april to may in deference to these concerns opposition parties 
continue to argue that they do not have enough time to organize 
recruit candidates and publicize their programs and that they are 
not being given sufficient air time on the governmentcontrolled 
media ms tutwiler said

a quaker organization said tuesday that the 
american penal system quakers helped create 200 years ago is a 
failure and announced that they have formed a commission to 
reexamine the nations criminal justice system 
the compelling need in the united states is for transformation 
of our priorities said stephen g cary chairman of the board of 
the american friends service committee cary called for a new 
awareness that the strength of a nation does not lie in might but 
in education and jobs and homes and medical care for all its 
people 
cary said that when quakers helped create the first penitentiary 
system they had hoped for a rehabilitative rather than a 
punitive focus 
the new national commission on crime and justice is composed of 
black hispanic american indian and asianamerican experts and 
community activists from around the country 
throughout the year the commission will organize a series of 
hearings and public education tours of prison facilities across the 
nation under a program called 200 years of the penitentiary 
project 
by 1990 one million men and women will be held in us prisons 
and jails according to the committee which released statistics 
saying 46 percent of state prisoners in 1984 were black and 10 
percent were hispanic

bush administration officials expressed anger 
tuesday with un secretary general javier perez de cuellar for 
what they said was his reneging on a promise to issue a report on 
human rights in cuba 
but perez de cuellars spokesman said that he had made no such 
commitment and that the us officials with whom he spoke had 
misunderstood him 
the state department said us officials had asked perez de 
cuellar to make a report on his assessment of the rights situation 
in cuba after he had indicated he would prepare such a report if 
asked to do so by one or more un members 
other us officials asking not to be identified said that 
perez de cuellar had made the commitment to vice president dan 
quayle among others they said secretary of state james a baker 
iii is expected to send a letter to perez de cuellar setting forth 
the us position 
the bush administration has been eager to highlight what it 
regards as the abuse by cuban authorities of cubans who testified 
before a sixmember un rights group that visited the country on a 
factfinding mission in 1988 
the state department maintained than cuban persecution of these 
and other human rights activists warrants urgent action by the 
commission 
asked about the bush administrations irritation over the issue 
un spokesman francois guiliani said perez de cuellar had told 
quayle in december that any member of the commission could bring 
the topic up for discussion 
perez de cuellar would issue a report if asked to do so by the 
commission but had not promised quayle he would take such a step at 
the request of a single member guiliani said 
he also said perez de cuellars position was based on the 
commissions rejection of an amendment at the 1989 session asking 
him to issue a report on the rights situation in cuba 
an official at the cuban diplomatic mission here insisting on 
anonymity said it was possible that some cubans who testified 
before the commission are now being detained but he said the 
detentions were for violations of cuban law and were not connected 
to their testimony to the commission

to lower income needs have been terminated he said 
without more construction he said the homeless will grow and 
its human and economic cost will dwarf any price tag attached to

historic provisions in 1985 farm law will help 
farmers move rapidly toward the elimination of severe soil erosion 
on much of the nations cropland by the mid1990s a private 
conservation group said tuesday 
a study of more than 1000 farms in selected areas across the 
nation showed that the conservation provisions of the 1985 food 
security act have been a main force in prodding and luring farmers 
into protecting soil and water resources 
the report released here by the soil and water conservation 
society of ankeny iowa focused on the 1985 laws provisions 
governing the use of fragile highly erodible land and wetland 
areas 
specific deadlines were set for farmers to comply with 
agriculture department regulations for conservation planning and 
project completion 
the law also established a 10year conservation reserve program 
with a goal of removing 40 million to 45 million acres of highly 
erodible cropland from production by the end of this year about 34 
million acres have been signed 
under the program farmers must plant the idled land in 
protective grass or trees in return they get federal costsharing 
payments to establish the soil cover plus annual rental payments 
for 10 years those average about 50 per acre annually 
for the first time in history receipt of most federal farm 
program benefits commodity price supports agricultural credit 
and crop insurance became legally contingent on the application 
of appropriate land stewardship practices by agricultural 
producers the report said 
the laws four conservation parts outlined the conservation 
reserve program or crp and socalled sodbuster swampbuster and 
compliance provisions that the report said have been generally well 
accepted by farmers 
we may well accomplish a greater measure of erosion control on 
the nations cropland in the next five years than we have 
accomplished in the preceding 50 said project director max 
schnepf 
but this report makes it clear that a great deal remains to be 
done by farmers and by the federal government if we are to realize 
the full potential of the 1985 farm bills conservation 
provisions he said 
schnepf said the project began in mid1988 and that the report 
is the first of several planned for a threeyear evaluation 
norman a berg a member of the societys steering committee and 
former head of the soil conservation service in usda said the 1985 
farm law for the first time linked farm policies and program 
benefits to sound conservation practices 
the law provided leverage we did not have before to curb 
erosion and protect wetlands berg said 
society officials said the study which had financial support 
from the joyce foundation of chicago was by no means a 
statistically valid survey of all us land however the project 
did entail a close look at conservation work in 22 representative 
counties 
the report said 
conservation reserve program field checks show that soil 
erosion will be reduced 91 percent on land enrolled in the program 
although the total tonnage of soil saved may be lower than usda has 
reported 
sodbuster and swampbuster provisions with the potential loss 
of federal benefits appear to be discouraging farmers from 
improperly cultivating fragile land and converting wetlands to crop 
production however there have been violations and usda 
officials are not adequately monitoring or enforcing the policies 
in some areas 
conservation compliance which requires farmers to adopt and 
carry out conservation plans will result in significant reductions 
in erosion if the plans are implemented but final implementation 
will be difficult for a significant number of farmers unless 
they adopt adopt additional lowcost erosioncontrol practices

a judge who illegally released a reputed 
leader of the medellin cocaine cartel has been sentenced to six 
years in prison for obstruction of justice a federal court said 
tuesday 
fabio pastrana hoyos was fired from his post as a customs judge 
in the caribbean coastal city of cartagena after his 1986 order 
freeing jorge luis ochoa vasquez considered the second in command 
of the drug trafficking cartel 
pastrana was found guilty monday of obstruction of justice and 
sentenced by the federal court in cartagena the courts clerk said 
in a news release 
in 1986 ochoa was arrested in spain on charges of shipping 127 
fighting bulls to colombia 
the united states asked for his extradition on drug trafficking 
charges and colombia asked for his extradition on the contraband 
charge 
spain opted to send ochoa to colombia where authorities also 
had a us request for his extradition 
on aug 17 1986 without ever having ochoa brought before him 
the customs judge sentenced ochoa to 28 months in prison for 
illegally bringing the bulls into colombia 
he then suspended the sentence released ochoa immediately and 
put him on probation 
pastrana claimed that he released ochoa because the justice 
ministry had not told him ochoa was wanted for extradition but an 
investigation showed the judge had been notified to keep ochoa in 
custody for the extradition request 
ochoa was arrested again nov 20 1987 but again a judge set 
him free that judge andres enrique montanez of a federal court 
in bogota also was fired montanez was never charged with a crime 
in releasing ochoa 
no major trafficking suspect has ever been convicted and served 
a prison sentence in colombia presumably because drug traffickers 
either bribe or threaten judges to release them 
five judges have been killed by traffickers since the government 
started cracking down on the traffickers aug 18 
in the last five months 13 middlelevel trafficking suspects 
have been extradited to the united states one medellin cartel 
leader gonzalo rodriguez gacha was killed in a shootout with

israeli leaders on tuesday denied the 
government has urged soviet jews to settle in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip where palestinians are fighting for their own 
state 
the comments followed protests from the united states the 
soviet union and arab leaders who said establishing settlements in 
the territories could hurt chances for peace 
yossi benaharon head of prime minister yitzhak shamirs 
office said anyone who comes to israel can go wherever he 
chooses 
he said only a few hundred immigrants out of a total of 12000 
last year chose to live in the territories which israel captured 
from jordan and egypt in 1967 
the soviet union and united states criticized shamirs statement 
earlier this month suggesting israel has to retain the occupied 
territories to settle soviet immigrants 
in moscow the soviet foreign ministry on monday condemned any 
plan to endanger soviet emigres by using them to crowd 
palestinians out of their own land and suggested such settlements 
could undercut moscows plans to further liberalize emigration laws 
foreign minister moshe arens said that the soviet message was 
not expressed very politely and we are sorry about it especially 
because it is based on misunderstanding over the positions of the 
israeli government 
he added nobody is sending people to this or the other 
place 
israels top diplomat in moscow arye levin told reporters he 
did not believe the soviets were threatening to curtail 
immigration he flew to israel on tuesday for what he described as 
a family visit 
another shamir aide avi pazner suggested that the soviets were 
trying to allay fears of palestinians and arab leaders 
the arabs are exerting heavy pressure on the russians 
concerning immigration and mr shamir expressed his hope that the 
artificial storm would pass pazner said 
us state department spokesman richard boucher was quoted by 
the jerusalem post as telling reporters in washington on monday 
that putting even more settlers into the territories is an 
obstacle to the cause of peace 
the arab leagues representative in washington on tuesday said 
us comments on the issue have not gone far enough ambassador 
clovis maksoud told a news conference that washington should 
reassess its policy against settlement of soviet jews in the west 
bank and gaza strip 
jordans prime minister mudar badran said arab countries were 
discussing sending a delegation to the soviet union and other east 
bloc countries to discuss the situation he said continued 
immigration will create instability and tension in the region 
we have good contacts and friendly relations with many eastern 
bloc countries and soon an arab delegation will move to brief those 
countries on the dangers of this issue badran said 
he spoke to reporters at the end of a twoday visit by syrian 
premier mahmmoud alzouebi both men said they would welcome an 
emergency arab summit to discuss the issue 
six leftwing parties have filed noconfidence motions in the 
knesset or parliament over shamirs remarks this month 
israeli legislators and soviet jewish activists in israel have 
accused shamir of endangering jewish immigration at a time of 
growing concern about antisemitism in the soviet union 
yitzhak abrahmson head of a soviet immigrants group said on 
israel radio he was worried that shamirs statement could lead to a 
soviet clampdown on exit visas 
the jerusalem post daily reported tuesday that georgi 
martirosov head of the soviet diplomatic mission in israel met 
with foreign ministry officials over the issue and blamed shamir 
for the delay in ratifying an agreement to resume direct flights 
between the two nations 
martirosov said shamirs statements hindered any possibility 
of moving this process forward the post said 
deputy finance minister yossi beilin told army radio that 
officials from a sixmember soviet commercial delegation visiting 
israel also expressed uneasiness over shamirs remarks and 
linked these things with the development of our ties with them 
moscow broke diplomatic ties with israel over the occupation of 
the territories it supports palestinian demands for an independent 
state in the west bank and gaza strip and says restored ties with 
israel are conditional on progress in middle east peace efforts

a supreme court justice tuesday refused to bar 
the television program inside edition from broadcasting scenes 
filmed with a hidden camera inside a new york city doctors office 
justice antonin scalia without comment rejected an emergency 
request in which dr stuart m bergers lawyers sought to block the 
broadcast 
an inside edition spokeswoman said the program plans to 
include the scenes in a segment about berger 
a federal judge in detroit ordered the program to keep the 
secretly recorded scenes off the air but a federal appeals court 
panel overturned the judges order as an unconstitutional prior 
restraint of free speech 
berger author of several widely sold diet books is under 
investigation by the new york state department of healths office 
of professional medical conduct for alleged unethical and 
fraudulent conduct 
in its own investigation of berger the television program sent 
one of its producers to the doctors office as a patient producer 
amy wasserstrom said in an affidavit she surreptitiously videotaped 
two visits she made to the office 
ms wasserstrom said berger diagnosed her as suffering from an 
allergy to yeast and from chronic fatigue but another doctor told 
her she had no such ailments 
bergers lawyers said airing the office scenes will do 
irreparable harm to his reputation and the sanctity of his 
office 
this case raises an important substantive issue dealing with 
the right of an individual to be free from the publication of 
information and more specifically a videotape illegally obtained 
by the very same organization which now desires to broadcast it to 
the 100 largest television audiences in the united states 
bergers lawyers said 
us district judge barbara k hackett in detroit issued a 
temporary restraining order jan 18 blocking broadcast of the 
office scenes after finding they were filmed in violation of 
federal antiwiretape law and new york law 
a threejudge panel of the 6th us circuit court of appeals in 
cincinnati however unanimously ruled monday that the restraining 
order was unconstitutional 
we are satisfied that the district court clearly erred in its 
interpretation of first amendment law the appeals court panel 
said 
any prior restraint bears a heavy presumption against its 
constitutional validity it said berger simply has not shown 
the type of irreparable harm that can justify a prior restraint 
the syndicated television program is owned by king world 
productions inc

the united states international partners in 
the space station program tuesday bitterly accused nasa of acting 
in bad faith by excluding them last year when the stations 
construction schedule was extended 
partners do not operate at arms length nor do they make 
decisions unilaterally that will damage the interest of the other 
partners reinhard loosch of west germany told a congressional 
hearing 
loosch said he hoped the schism that developed was merely one 
of the teething troubles of the partnership called the most 
advanced and costly international technological project ever 
undertaken 
the government of the federal republic of germany cannot hide 
its disappointment said loosch west germanys deputy assistant 
director for international cooperation 
in july when it appeared congress might cut 400 million from 
the space station program nasa planners secluded themselves at the 
langley research center in virginia and worked out plans to cope 
with the shortfall the international partners were told in august 
of the changes mainly a oneyear delay in completing construction 
congress too was kept in the dark 
rep robert roe dnj who chaired tuesdays hearing of his 
house committee on science and technology said regrettably this 
committee learned of this exercise from media reports and was not 
directly consulted 
the committee expressed its anger last year at a hearing to 
which it summoned top nasa management 
it turned out that nasa was denied only 200 million and some 
design changes were restored 
but reimar luest director general of the european space agency 
said that in the revised plan only us payloads were adequately 
provided for anything related to esa was left in the mists of 
a new second part of the program for which a detailed schedule 
was not available 
he said the action violated international agreements and 
offered no protections for esas major investment 
esa which represents 10 nations is obligated to provide the 
columbus laboratory module an unmanned freeflying polar platform 
and another free flyer at an investment of about 3 billion 
japan signed on to provide an experiment module also to be 
permanently attached to the space station base at a similar cost 
if nasas space station budget were cut then the burden of 
the cuts must be equitably shared among the partners it should not 
be shifted by nasa onto the other partners luest said 
learco saporito a senator in italys parliament said that not 
only the space station but also the credibility of the united 
states as a partner was at stake 
it concerns the very substance and basic foundation of the 
international cooperation and of the entire project of the space 
station saporito said such doubts may have negative 
consequences in those countries like italy which are your closest 
allies 
any major change in fundamental elements would present japan 
with great difficulties in continuing with the cooperative 
program said akira kubozono executive director of japans 
national space development agency 
suspicion of the japanese public on the stability of the 
international space station program could raise great difficulties 
in continuing to secure political and financial support to this 
program he said

senate democrats on tuesday proposed a 
halfbillion dollar aid package 200 million more than president 
bush wants to foster emerging democracies in eastern europe 
the bill introduced by sen claiborne pell rri and the 
senate foreign relations committee chairman would augment 738 
million in aid already approved for poland and hungary with 511 
million targeted at czechoslovakia east germany romania bulgaria 
and yugoslavia 
pell said he would not be surprised if his proposal is increased 
during the legislative process in view of the profound interest 
of the united states in supporting positive developments in eastern 
europe 
bush as part of the fiscal 1991 budget he proposed monday 
asked for 300 million as a special assistance initiative for 
countries behind the crumbling iron curtain including poland and 
hungary 
white house budget director richard darman told the house budget 
committee tuesday that the distribution of the 300 million which 
would need congressional approval had not yet been determined 
pells proposal includes liberalizing trade relations and 
providing noneconomic assistance such as management training to 
the soviet union 
it also would tell the administration to confer 
mostfavorednation trade status on all of the eastern european 
countries at the earliest possible date support their admission to 
the international monetary fund and make them eligible for 
exportimport bank loans and loan guarantees 
in addition the bill would provide 43 million to foster the 
development of noncommunist parties and free elections in the 
soviet bloc counties plus an immediate 80 million in food aid for 
romania 
sen richard lugar rind and a senior member of the foreign 
relations committee said he applauded the idealism of pells 
proposal but noted that the countries to which the aid was to be 
expanded still are under heavy communist influence 
soviet troops remain elections have not yet occurred and 
multiple layers of old communist bureaucracy remain he noted 
we have to be cautious lugar told reporters thus far we 
are not in a position to send a lot of money into areas where the 
people we are trying to assist may not be in a position to have a 
whole lot of control over it 
pells bill devotes the bulk of the proposed aid 250 million 
to capitalizing a european bank for reconstruction and development 
with the intent of facilitating billions of dollars in private 
investment across the east bloc 
businessmen told the house ways and means committee on tuesday 
they are not willing to make those investments unless congress goes 
beyond waiving and actually repeals the 1974 jacksonvanik and 
other restrictions on trade with the soviet union and eastern bloc 
countries

us military officials stepped in to 
stop abuses of civilians by government troops tracking rebels but 
no us officers have engaged in combat a us official said 
tuesday 
rebels of the national patriotic front invaded the nimba county 
region which borders ivory coast on dec 24 in a bid to oust 
president samuel doe 
liberian authorities say the rebels killed about 200 people 
including 16 government officials before government troops quelled 
the attempt 
since then the troops have been trying to chase down the 
insurgents and africa watch a usbased human rights group has 
accused the liberian military of killing at least 200 civilians 
during the search 
amnesty international has quoted refugees and other sources as 
saying hundreds of civilians were killed by soldiers or rebels and 
the us embassy had expressed concern 
in washington tuesday state department spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said american military advisers have been working with the 
liberian military for a number of years 
she said that following reports civilians were being harassed in 
nimba county doe sent a us officer she identified only as gen 
craig to take charge of the forces there and instructed him to end 
these abuses 
two american officers from the us military mission in liberia 
accompanied craig and other senior defense ministry officials to 
assist them in ending abuses she said 
mrs tutwiler said the us officers were acting only as 
advisers and not engaged in combat operations 
the chief of staff of liberias armed forces lt gen henry 
dubar said the us officials went to nimba county to assess the 
situation 
some of the more than 60000 refugees who fled to the ivory 
coast and guinea to escape the fighting have accused the soldiers 
of atrocities 
the rebels also have been accused of killing civilians 
doe warned soldiers last week that they could face firing squads 
if they harm civilians 
he said the rebel force came from ivory coast and was led by 
former civil servant charles taylor he accused ivory coast of 
aiding the insurgents a charge denied by that nation 
taylor a liberian government official from 1980 to 1983 was 
accused of embezzling nearly 1 million and fled to the united 
states where he was imprisoned pending extradition he escaped in 
1984 
doe came to power in a coup in april 1980 in which president 
william tolbert a descendant of freed american slaves and most of 
tolberts political allies were killed doe has withstood several 
coup attempts 
liberia was founded in 1847 by freed american slaves it is the

defense secretary dick cheneys decision to 
cancel the tiltrotor v22 osprey aircraft in the new military 
budget leaves the nations elite fighting forces struggling to 
find an aircraft for highrisk highspeed missions their 
commander said tuesday 
if the v22 is finally canceled ive got to have something 
else said army gen james lindsay the fourstar general in 
charge of the special operations command 
i had my day in court more than once i lost said 
lindsay whose specialized forces include the green berets and such 
supersecret fighters as the navy seals several thousand of his 
forces were involved in the panama invasion 
for the second consecutive year cheney has proposed shutting 
down the 27 billion program to produce the helicopter that can 
also fly like a plane arguing it is too expensive 
last year congress did not provide any money for procurement 
but did approve some funds to continue research and development 
the debate is only one of many that will erupt on capitol hill 
over cheneys fiscal 1991 spending plan which has been criticized 
by opponents as favoring bigticket nuclear programs over other 
weaponry 
lindsay refused to directly criticize cheneys decision saying 
he was not an expert in budget matters and that cheney is in 
a very different position than im in he has to make pretty tough 
decisions 
thats right when you lose you lose cheney said in an 
interview with wire service reporters when told of lindsays 
remarks the v22 struck me as a lower priority item than other 
of the things we need to fund we cant afford everything wed 
like to have 
but lindsay argued that even if the v22 is canceled he will 
still need a highspeed craft that can drop men into position and 
return to pick them up many times when no airfield is available 
lindsay cited the failed operation to rescue us hostages in 
iran as a case where a fastmoving refuelable transport plane 
could be used on a longrange mission 
the united states launched an airborne attempt in april 1980 to 
free hostages being held in the us embassy in tehran but the 
mission was called off after one of the helicopters developed 
engine trouble in a staging area in the iranian desert eight 
americans were reported killed and several injured in the collision 
of two planes in the subsequent withdrawal of the us force 
lindsay said hed lost to those who say his men can get by with 
helicopters and the fulton system that allows a flying c130 
transport plane to pluck men from the ground 
i need something better than that and i need something 
reasonably fast he said and it cant be a helicopter i need 
more agility 
lindsay said he did not have another vehicle to do the job and 
did not know where he was going to get one if the v22 is canceled 
at this point in time we are struggling with it he said 
adding that even the v22 did not meet the speed or range 
requirements he would like 
asked if he could name missions where the v22 was absolutely 
necessary lindsay said he couldnt cite a specific case 
but i can tell you i just know were going to be faced with 
situations where if we can go deep and go fast and not be tied to 
airfield that is a distinct advantage he said

the mayor proposed a student police corps to 
augment the police presence downtown and provide young people with 
parttime jobs 
the goals are to create more connections between police and 
youths and to set up a new recruiting device for the police 
department mayor don fraser said monday 
under the plan to be made public in the mayors state of the 
city address late tuesday trained high school and college students 
equipped with uniforms and radios would be supervised by beat 
officers 
the students would not carry weapons fraser said they would 
call for assistance if they witnessed crimes he discounted any 
threat to their safety 
the likelihood is that they would always be in pairs by 
themselves or with officers he said the risks would be pretty 
low 
deputy mayor rip rapson said many details have yet to be worked 
out it is a request from the mayor to the chief to develop the 
idea and to assess whether it will work he said 
such things as pay insurance ways to protect the young 
peoples safety and training still must be worked out he said 
fraser said he wants the plan to take effect in 1991 it would 
include active minority recruiting and be open to all students ages

candidates and this is one way of doing that rapson said 
downtown business leaders have been pushing for more police 
protection in response to a growing perception that the central 
business district is becoming increasingly unsafe

downtown such as antisocial behavior fights among kids rapson

a district of columbia employee who law 
enforcement sources say has accused mayor marion barry of cocaine 
involvement pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor drug charge tuesday 
then immediately began testifying before a grand jury investigating 
barry 
james mcwilliams testified for two hours after his plea which 
us attorney jay b stephens called another significant step 
in the investigation 
barry who was arrested jan 18 on a misdemeanor cocaine 
possession charge has denied under oath using drugs with convicted 
cocaine dealer charles lewis at a downtown washington hotel more 
than a year earlier in december 1988 
the charge against mcwilliams stemmed from allegations of visits 
to lewis hotel room some of which prosecutors say coincided with 
barrys visits 
meanwhile washingtons wrctv quoting unnamed sources said 
barry could be indicted within two weeks by the grand jury which 
has been looking into allegations of perjury and cocaine possession 
mcwilliams a city motor vehicles department employee and a 
longtime lewis associate declined to comment either before or 
after his grand jury testimony he pleaded guilty to a charge of 
aiding and abetting drug possession which carries a maximum 
penalty of one year in prison and a 100000 fine 
according to a source familiar with the case mcwilliams has 
told authorities he was present once when the mayor and lewis 
disappeared into the bathroom of the hotel room for a short time 
mcwilliams told prosecutors he smelled crack cocaine and then 
saw the mayor emerge from the bathroom under the influence of the 
drug the source said 
mcwilliams 57 was called before the grand jury investigating 
the case last january but refused to testify at that time 
carole bland jackson a former business partner of the woman who 
was in a hotel room when barry was arrested this month in an fbi 
sting also said in weekend interviews that she was present when 
barry used cocaine at a 1986 party 
the mayor is in florida at a private facility being treated for 
what aides say is primarily an alcohol abuse problem 
lewis pleaded guilty to cocaine conspiracy charges last november 
in washington and was convicted on cocaine distribution charges in 
the virgin islands last spring 
lewis who is cooperating with prosecutors testified under oath 
during his plea bargaining session in november that he had supplied 
barry with crack cocaine 
in meetings with prosecutors in the past week mcwilliams also 
said the mayor called him after barrys ties to lewis became public 
and told him he trusted him to keep quiet about what he had seen in 
the hotel room two law enforcement sources said 
barry has said he only called mcwilliams to urge him to 
cooperate with authorities investigating the case 
at a news conference stephens refused to say whether he intends 
to question bodyguards assigned to the mayor on a roundtheclock 
basis but said prosecutors will want to cover any witness that 
might be able to provide information regarding this case 
the prosecutor also said he would be comfortable showing jurors 
a videotape of barry and rasheeda moore in the hotel room before 
and during barrys arrest on jan 18 
stephens also denied the investigation of the mayor was racially 
motivated as naacp president benjamin hooks and others have 
suggested 
our job is to follow allegations diligently and 
aggressively stephens said we have done so without favor to 
position to race politics or any other consideration 
he said barrys attorney r kenneth mundy will be given both 
original and enhanced copies of the tape next week

national drug policy coordinator william 
bennett said tuesday that while the nation is a long way from 
winning its war against drugs it already has achieved a victory 
over confusion about how to fight the battle 
and that includes he said enough federal state and local 
financing for treatment programs to get very close to meeting 
the medical and rehabilitation needs of drug abusers 
although some urban and community leaders have charged that the 
bush administration has seriously underfunded the treatment and 
education components of its new 102 billion antidrug budget 
bennett made clear his rejection of that notion 
in fiscal 1991 he said we will bring the treatment budget up 
to 13 billion or 14 billion which when you combine the 
treatment availability from all sources federal state and local 
will provide access for something like 17 million people to 
receive treatment 
were getting very close to capacity to responding to the 
full dimension of the treatment need he said 
in an address to the national press club bennett repeated his 
declaration of last week that the nation is beginning to end 
the war on drugs 
the best news for now he said is a political consensus on 
strategy and the publics hardening attitude about drug abuse 
we now have almmost the entire country becoming more intolerant 
and more conservative on the issue 
bennett noted that he will testify next week before the senate 
judiciary committee on drug strategy and my guess is that some 
members of that committee will try to argue fundamental 
differences in fact fundamental differences among democrats and 
republicans on major issues of drug strategy exist no more though 
there will always be small differences in emphasis 
and thats the thing theres been a victory over confusion 
that much we surely have won theres now a great consensus on the 
various steps we can take 
he said that overall drug use in america went down from 1985 
to 1988 by some 37 percent so says the national institute on drug 
abuse 
its down in urban america as well as rural america its 
down in white america as well as black america its down in rich 
america as well as poor america 
still he acknowledged even as weve seen a decrease in 
overall drug use weve seen an increase in addictions this will 
be the case for a few more years we will see the number of people 
who are addicted keep rising 
there are great casualties he said some large percentage 
of a million drug addicts will be dead or walking dead among use 
for years to come

police used batons rubber 
bullets and tear gas tuesday to prevent 1000 blacks from marching 
on a stadium to protest a boycottbusting english cricket teams 
match against a south african university team 
the cricket teams tour has caused confrontations every place 
the visiting cricketers have appeared including their hotels 
where black employees refuse to serve them the team is defying an 
international ban on sports contact with south africa 
there also were demonstrations by black squatters in rising 
political unrest only three days before president fw de klerk is 
to open parliament he is expected to discuss reforms in south 
africa and ease the emergency regulations in force since 1986 to 
quell antiapartheid activity 
a progovernment newspaper the citizen predicted that de klerk 
would end news media restrictions but probably not ease other 
regulations it also said the release from prison of black 
nationalist nelson mandela could be delayed because of the unrest 
the stadium clash between police and blacks was at bloemfontein 
in the orange free state 
one policeman punched a black teenager in the chest with a 
baton another pressed his truncheon around a black youths neck to 
bring him down as some demonstrators threw stones at police 
vehicles and erected burning tire barricades in the streets of 
mangaung township 
obed nkosi an organizer for the antiapartheid national sports 
council said 30 people were hurt 
police said 45 people were arrested and one white businessman 
was slightly injured when his vehicle was stoned by protesters 
an approved protest by about 500 people outside the stadium was 
allowed to take place 
police also fired tear gas at 150 black squatters protesting 
their eviction from kraaifontein a neighborhood designated for 
whites outside cape town the rev allan boesak a prominent 
antiapartheid activist was among those affected by the tear gas 
police in cape town urged the public to stay out of the city 
center wednesday and friday because people are bound to get 
hurt when action is taken to stop planned protest marches to 
police headquarters and parliament 
the march organizers refuse to seek official permission and 
police capt gys boonzaaier said the police are obliged to act 
if the gathering is illegal we are going to take action and 
disperse them we would like to urge the public to stay away 
as people are bound to get hurt 
since de klerk became president the government has allowed 
several massive marches to take place without the organizers 
seeking permission de klerk was quoted as telling police 
commanders two weeks ago that they are no longer required to 
prevent people from gathering to gain support for their views 
but police officials say as long as there are regulations 
against illegal gatherings those without magisterial 
permission police must act to stop them 
the stage is set for a major confrontation friday when black 
activists hope to have 10000 people marching toward parliament as 
de klerk makes his speech outlining his plans for reforms leading 
to negotiations with the black majority on a new constitution 
there are firm indications that de klerk will announce 
some easing of the state of emergency in his opening address to 
parliament on friday said the citizen which has good government 
sources the first of the emergency regulations expected to be 
lifted are those which were imposed on the media 
the paper said mandelas release is not expected until 
midfebruary at the earliest reporters earlier in the week said 
mandela might not be freed until march 
the emergency restrictions prohibit journalists from being at 
the scene of political unrest and from reporting anything about 
it or describing any police activity without permission 
journalists are also banned from reporting a wide range of 
statements that the government considers subversive including 
calls for boycotts economic sanctions and criticisms of the 
military 
the restrictions have not been uniformly enforced but 
photographers and television crews have been most affected they 
are often arrested and have their film confiscated 
also tuesday the johannesburg city council declared the citys 
business districts open to tradesmen of all races but expressed 
regret it could not do the same for residential areas 
the city council of pretoria also voted to open most municipal 
facilities and the business districts but proapartheid 
conservative party members said they will try all legal means to 
reverse the decision government radio reported the new policy 
applies to buses libraries city hall and other buildings 
johannesburg the nations largest city has already opened 
municipal facilities such as toilets libraries public halls and 
swimming pools to all races buses remain segregated in many areas 
of the city 
we are moving toward a discriminationfree city said 
marietta marx a johannesburg council member from the national 
party which controls the national government and established the 
policy of apartheid 
but we still have the contorted logic which is a black can 
work anywhere but not live there said ian davidson a council 
member of the antiapartheid democratic party 
city councils have no power to desegregate residential areas 
schools or hospitals which are controlled by the national 
government

the iraqi army attacked dozens of villages in southern iraq this 
month and killed many civilians in an apparent attempt to capture 
army deserters 
also tuesday an iraqi kurdish group claimed the iraqi military 
killed more than 60 fishermen this month 
iraq denied both reports 
amnesty international the londonbased human rights monitoring 
group said in a statement it received reports that large numbers 
of people including unarmed civilians and army deserters were 
killed or wounded in southern iraq 
the statement said the attacks targeted more than 30 towns and 
villages in the predominantly shiite moslem region from jan 10 to 
jan 23 
amnesty said it was not clear what prompted the military 
attacks but reports received by it suggest the attacks were 
related to government attempts to capture hundreds of army 
deserters 
an iraqi rights group the londonbased organization of human 
rights in iraq said friday that 10000 people were killed or 
wounded in an army crackdown in southern iraq 
it said tens of thousands were left homeless after the raids 
the group is recognized by the united nations and coordinates its 
work with amnesty 
a spokesman for the iraqi ministry of information invited 
journalists to visit the areas to investigate the reports 
we invite any foreign reporter to come to iraq and see for 
himself the false and fabricated story of amnesty international 
the spokesman who asked not to be identified told the associated 
press office in baghdad 
the marshes of southern iraq were hiding places for army 
deserters during the eightyear iraniraq war but hundreds 
surrendered to the army after the august 1988 ceasefire 
requests to visit the marshes in the past usually were rejected 
by the ministry of information which supervises the visits of 
foreign correspondents throughout iraq 
also tuesday a report by the londonbased kurdish patriotic 
union said more than 60 kurdish fishermen were killed this month 
when iraqi helicopter gunships attacked fishing boats on lake dukan 
in northwestern iraq 
the victims were civilians who had no connection to the kurdish 
guerrillas fighting the government for autonomy said the kurdish 
groups spokesman who spoke to the ap in nicosia cyprus by 
telephone he refused to give his name 
the official iraqi news agency quoted an unidentified 
information ministry spokesman as saying that the kurdish report 
is slander and lies aimed at harming stability and security in 
the kurdistan area

coupon connie claimed she clipped and traded 
like any housewife but a jury convicted her tuesday on charges she 
took part in a 2 million scheme to swap and redeem hundreds of 
thousands of bogus coupons 
connie arvidson 34 of boca raton fla was convicted on two 
counts of mail fraud and one of conspiracy 
she was the person knowingly buying and selling large numbers 
of coupons assistant us attorney steve sucsy said tuesday 
her statement to the effect she was only doing what any number of 
innocent housewives were doing was not so 
the jury also convicted david rees of center point of the only 
charge against him a conspiracy count said maureen ruprecht 
court coordinator for us district judge sidney fitzwater 
a third defendant printer james floyd richards of san antonio 
was cleared of all three counts against him 
mrs arvidson also known as the dumpster lady because she 
would root through garbage bins looking for coupons faces up to 15 
years in prison and 750000 in fines sentencing is scheduled 
march 23 
ive always felt that i was being made an example of so the 
prosecution ought to be happy mrs arvidson 34 said after the 
verdict adding she will not continue with her coupon business 
the defendants were accused of counterfeiting more than 600000 
copies of coupons issued by 47 companies including procter amp 
gamble nabisco brands inc and campbell soup co 
prosecutors said mrs arvidson bought the bogus coupons from san 
antonio counterfeiter david rackmill rackmill who faces five 
years in prison for his role in the scam pleaded guilty to mail 
fraud and conspiracy and then acted as an informant 
an indictment last june said that beginning in june 1988 
rackmill obtained legitimate coupons and provided them to rees 
along with a payment rees in turn would give the coupons to 
richards for counterfeiting 
sucsy said mrs arvidson used the coupons to buy the products 
then sold them at flea markets but her main income came through 
selling the coupons for more than she paid for them he said 
in opening arguments sucsy said mrs arvidson also initially 
placed orders for the counterfeit coupons directly with rackmill 
but later became nervous and arranged for rees to be middleman 
mrs arvidsons income from her coupon hobby was once estimated 
at 40000 a year but her attorney said the coupon swapping 
business only netted about 200 a week and she did not knowingly 
sell counterfeit coupons 
the counterfeit ring was uncovered after a fourmonth 
investigation by the us postal service the defendants were 
arraigned last august and the trial began on jan 8 the jury 
deliberated for five days 
fitzwater ordered mrs arvidson to post a 10000 bond while 
rees was freed on personal recognizance 
seven other people were indicted all of whom agreed to 
cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for leniency

foreign airlines will be allowed to expand 
service to more american cities in exchange for open markets for 
us carriers transportation secretary samuel k skinner said 
tuesday 
deregulation of the us airline industry is working well 
skinner said now its time that we work to deregulate 
international aviation markets

competition for air transportation around the world 
the department of transportation invited foreign airlines to 
apply for the oneyear renewable authority to provide air service 
between their home countries or wide open to and us cities that dont 
have such 
service 
skinner said the decision would improve international service 
and provide evidence of us commitment to competitive 
international aviation and willingness to try innovative ways to 
encourage other countries to adopt our approach 
the new program is limited to cities where no us or foreign 
airline provides nonstop or onestop singleplane service from the 
foreign lines home country

new city councilors with an antitax 
antispending agenda shot into office surprising even new 
hampshire residents used to independent rule with an attempt to 
immediately overhaul the government 
in a postinauguration meeting monday night the council ordered 
no increases in the 199091 budget no new services and a citywide 
hiring freeze it also canceled a grant application for money to 
build a homeless shelter 
councilors proposed a charter change to take away the city 
managers sole authority to hire and fire department heads another 
proposal would enable voters not the council to decide the city 
tax rate 
i did some housekeeping said thomas tardif the new mayor 
made some improvements as i see it 
the socalled straight arrow slate of candidates caused a 
stir in november by promising to oppose any budget proposals 
calling for a tax increase in the town of 16000 20 miles north of 
concord voters elected a twothirds majority to the council 
new hampshire is proud of independent local government so why 
the fuss 
it appears the arrows have gone too far too fast 
its a matter of you didnt use my ball to play now im 
going to get even its not a constructive council said armand 
bolduc a former councilor i hate to think the city will have to 
put up with these clowns for two years 
he said he has never seen a council do away with everything 
another council had done 
councilor wesley colby not a straight arrow was upset after 
the meeting 
six of the seven straight arrows elected to the nineperson 
council said they had met to discuss the plans before monday night 
they ran on an opengovernment platform i dont care if they 
say they had no formal meeting or not that thing was 
orchestrated said colby the arrogance of it all annoyed me 
but james burke city attorney said the process of changing a 
city charter is outlined in state statute and is not a matter of 
local law there will be a public hearing feb 8 on the proposed 
amendments if there is an election scheduled after that voters 
will decide any changes he said

a nasa jet carried a 
pegasus airlaunched rocket over the pacific ocean on tuesday 
during a dress rehearsal for the boosters first real launch in 
march officials said 
im very happy this was a very good day for the pegasus 
program said bob lovell vice president of orbital sciences 
corp the virginia company that developed the 49footlong rocket 
in a private joint venture with delawarebased hercules aerospace 
corp 
the 41000pound rocket designed to put small satellites in 
orbit cheaply was carried about 50 miles west of morro bay 
attached beneath the wings of the b52 bomber said nancy lovato 
spokeswoman for the national aeronautics and space administration 
it was the third captive carry flight test for pegasus 
which remains attached to the jet during such tests 
this third flight lasted two hours and reached a maximum 
altitude of 43000 feet lt col ed nicastri of the pentagons 
defense advanced research projects agency said in a statement 
two attempts to launch the rocket were simulated during the test 
flight but the rocket which has a 22footwide deltashaped 
wing wasnt released he added 
the b52 took off from this mojave desert military base at 8 
am pst and landed at 1001 am pst lovato said 
during its first real launch pegasus is to place in orbit a 
small navy communications satellite a nasa experiment and perhaps 
a small satellite that virginia will use for environmental 
monitoring of chesapeake bay during tuesdays test the rocket 
carried fullscale models to simulate the navy and nasa satellites 
the pentagon and nasa want to use the small rocket to launch 
small military and science satellites but pegasus also is expected 
to attract business from companies foreign governments and 
university scientists who need a cheap way to place payloads in 
orbit 
lovell said the cost will be 6 million to 8 million per 
launch depending on how much business pegasus gets 
there were some brief losses of radio communication between the 
jets crew and ground controllers during tuesdays test but were 
fixed quickly lovato said 
we also had a launch lock light come on when it wasnt 
supposed to but the jets crew knew through backup systems that 
the rocket was still safely locked in place lovell said adding 
we need to get a better light bulb in there 
skies were clear when the rocketbearing jet took off from 
edwards air force base but weather was cloudy over the pacific so 
the test demonstrates the validity of the pegasus concept 
which is to take off over the desert where you almost always have 
good weather and fly above the storms to carry out a successful 
launch lovell said

iranian resistance officials accused the 
iranian government tuesday of trying to conceal human rights abuses 
and impeding un officials who conducted an investigation last 
week 
what they saw was only the tip of the iceberg but it was 
enough to show them what was really going on said aladdin 
touran spokesman for the peoples mujahedeen of iran 
it was the first outside rights investigation in iran since the 
1979 islamic revolution and it came amid efforts by irans 
socalled moderate leaders to liberalize society and renew ties 
with the west 
the investigators now are in geneva where they will present a 
report to a meeting being held by the un human rights commission 
touran told a news conference at the united nations that the 
investigators visited only one of irans 653 prisons evin prison 
in tehran and only were allowed to see a workshop 
touran said his group had presented the investigators with 
voluminous documentation of widespread rights abuses including 
2000 written statements by alleged torture victims and a list of 
4725 political prisoners 1786 torturers 653 prisons and 30 mass 
grave sites 
the tehran government denies all allegations of rights abuse 
touran said the un officials met in tehran with some families 
of abuse victims 
he said authorities beat and harassed the families of victims

former defense secretary james r schlesinger 
called on the bush administration tuesday to respond to dramatic 
changes in the east bloc and plan a drastic cut of nearly 200000 
in us forces in europe 
schlesinger who ran the pentagon under president carter from 
1973 to 1975 acknowledged in testimony before the senate armed 
services committee that for years he had opposed reductions in us 
forces attached to nato 
given this background he said i believe a certain weight 
can be attached to the following recommendation 
we should plan now radically to scale back our forces in 
europe the time for that planning is now 
under questioning schlesinger said the us force in europe 
should number 75000 to 100000 down from the current 305000 
troops 
last may before the drive for democracy hit high gear in many 
warsaw pact nations president bush proposed a ceiling of 275000 
on us and soviet ground and air force personnel that would 
require a reduction of about 30000 us troops and about 325000 
soviet troops 
but schlesinger said if the united states sticks to its current 
position on manpower reductions it may fall into a trap of 
legitimatizing the longterm presence of soviet forces in eastern 
europe that might otherwise be withdrawn 
the appearance by schlesinger before the senate armed services 
panel is part of a series of hearings the committee is holding on 
how the united states should respond to the lessening soviet threat 
and its effects on the military budget

the chairman of the house armed services 
committee accused the bush administration tuesday of putting a 
political gun to the head of lawmakers with a partisan list of 
military base closings 
rep les aspin dwis said defense secretary dick cheneys 
list of more than 72 domestic facilities and 14 overseas 
installations that would be closed or scaled back had 
potential but he objected strongly to the way the 
administration wants congress to deal with the list 
this is merely a list of candidates for closure aspin told 
reporters at a news conference the upshot is that the list can 
be changed bases can be deleted or perhaps added that creates 
hostages for the administration vote against a veto override your 
base is safe vote to override your base is threatened 
the process is dead aspin said of the administration 
approach and he introduced legislation that would create a 
bipartisan commission to make new baseclosing recommendations 
cheney in an interview with news service reporters disputed 
aspins assertion that his ideas were dead or amounted to political 
blackmail 
the idea im putting a gun to their head is not a valid one 
cheney said 
the secretary said that because his list is not final changes 
could be made in it cheney he said he wouldnt rule out the idea 
of a blueribbon panel and said he had made his suggestions because 
it takes a long time to study such closures 
aspins suggested panel similar to a commission created by 
congress in 1988 would produce an allornothing list of closings 
for approval or rejection by the defense secretary and congress 
the recommendations of the 1988 panel to close 86 bases were 
adopted by congress last year 
cheney in presenting his 2921 billion military spending plan 
for fiscal 1991 proposed on monday a list of bases for closing or 
realignment that would be considered by lawmakers on an individual 
basis 
this puts a political gun to the head of a member with a base 
in his or her district aspin said 
the lawmaker contended cheneys process opens an enormous 
bargaining bazaar aspin cited as an example the recent house 
and senate votes on president bushs veto of legislation dealing 
with extending visas for chinese stuents in the united states 
if youve got a list of potential bases to be closed and the 
vote comes up on say overriding the veto on the china thing what 
youve done is create an awful lot of bargaining chips for the 
administration when it goes into negotiating with congressmen and 
senators on how their going to vote on the veto override he said 
questioned whether that was cheneys intention in proposing the 
bases for closing aspin said you have to ask mr cheney 
the wisconsin democrat also said the defense secretarys list 
clearly is political with 22 of 32 domestic bases slated for 
closing in democratic districts 
rep patricia schroeder dcolo a senior member of the house 
armed services committee said cheney has produced an unbalanced 
partisan hit list of base closings she said such an 
unbalanced package is just plain unacceptable 
however house speaker thomas s foley dwash declined to 
accuse the bush administration of playing politics in its choice of 
bases and said with a grin ive heard some republicans are 
very angry with the selections 
the speaker did say the decisions must be based on strategic 
needs of the country not political considerations 
cheney in the interview also took issue with the charge that 
his closure list was partisan 
he said a large number of bases were in democratic districts 
because there are more democrats in congress and because a large 
number of military installations are in democraticcontrolled 
states 
california gets about a third of the defense budget texas 
has a large number of bases its really not political he said 
thats a petty kind of game that i dont think serves 
anybodys interest i didnt sign on as secretary of defense to get 
democrats if id wanted to do that id have stayed in the house 
he said 
meanwhile rep pete stark dcalif released a brief telegram 
he sent to cheney on jan 23 urging him to close camp parks a 
reserve military base in the congressmans district 
cheney had said monday that not one member of congress contacted 
him about the base closings and suggested that their installation 
be closed 
to paraphrase henny youngmans famous line take my base 
please stark said mr secretary i am a member of congress 
and i do urge you to close camp parks

ambitious bankers were so willing to hide 
illegal drug money that they taught undercover agents how to do it 
a prosecutor charged tuesday as trial opened in a 32 million 
international moneylaundering case 
but a defense attorney said the government was trying to smear 
the bankers by bringing up ties to deposed panamanian dictator 
manuel noriega 
the bankers officers with the bank of credit and commerce 
international were all told up front about the source of the 
money said assistant us attorney michael rubenstein 
the bankers received essentially the same message this 
money comes from the illegal sale of narcotics in the united 
states specifically cocaine he said 
the bankers he said didnt care 
its not any business of mine who the customers are he 
quoted banker amjad awan as saying when told it was drug money 
awan who once claimed to handle noriegas secret accounts is 
on trial with four other former bcci officers and a colombian they 
are accused of conspiracy to traffic in drugs conspiracy to 
launder drug profits and various other counts of money laundering 
if convicted each faces from 35 years to life sentences and fines 
of at least 750000 
defense attorney john p hume denied any wrongdoing on the part 
of awan and complained that the government was characterizing him 
as noriegas onetime personal banker 
this is guilt by association by focusing in on panama and 
general noriega theyre causing you not to focus in on the 
problems of the transactions hume told jurors 
hume said awan was never told and had no idea he was dealing 
with drug profits the money came through a legitimate florida bank 
which the government said was cooperating in the sting 
investigation 
theres no evidence awan knowingly engaged in transactions 
described in the indictment hume said ask yourselves it is 
reasonable to do this for a promotion 
the other defendants are rudolf armbrect of medellin colombia 
syed aftab hussain bccis operations officer of the bank in 
panama akbar a bilgrami of miami a director of the latin 
american division sibte hassan who was an officer with the paris 
branch and ian howard french country manager based in paris 
hussains attorney likewise denied involvement saying his 
client was simply a junior officer in training basically a 
glorified teller who had no power to act on his own 
in opening arguments rubenstein described how millions of 
dollars in cash from drug sales were disguised in a series of 
international banking transactions involving bcci 
cash from drug sales was converted into certificates of deposit 
which were used first as collateral for loans then to pay them off 
as they matured the government said 
robert musella a us customs agent posing as a highstakes 
launderer met with awan in miami and stressed the need for 
absolute confidentiality for his clients the prosecutor said 
my clients are the biggest drug dealers in colombia 
rubenstein quoted musella as saying 
the trial is expected to last four to six months 
before the start of jury selection two weeks ago guilty pleas 
were entered by two divisions of bcci 
as part of a plea bargain bcci one of the worlds largest 
private financial institutions agreed to forfeit a record 14 
million in assets frozen earlier by the government and to cooperate 
against other defendants 
the indictment resulted from a twoyear sting operation 
eventually building a global laundering operation worth an 
estimated 32 million investigators said

palestinian woman carrying a firebomb and heading toward the 
western wall judaisms most holy site 
she was caught during a routine security check jerusalem

he said the woman lived in silwan an arab village inside 
jerusalem and that the firebomb was ready for use she was 
apprehended at a checkpoint in the old walled city leading to the 
western wall sandori said 
israel radio said the woman has refused to tell police her 
intended target 
the western wall also called the wailing wall is the only 
remnant of the second temple built by king herod and destroyed by 
the romans in 70 ad 
also on tuesday palestinian leader faisal husseini spoke in 
hebrew to an audience of about 250 jews in which he appealed for 
peace talks 
in arabbuna near jenin on the west bank three palestinians 
were stabbed to death and at least 15 other villagers were injured 
in a fight between rival families arab reports and the army said 
the fight in the mountain hamlet of 1000 inhabitants was 
reportedly over a money loan 
in nablus the west banks largest city with 120000 people 
israeli troops sealed two homes the army reported the homes 
belonged to palestinian men suspected of having killed eight arabs 
as collaborators with israel

civilians during the 25monthold uprising against israeli rule in 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip an additional 174 
palestinians were killed by fellow arabs most on suspicion of 
collaborating fortythree israelis have died in the violence 
israel has occupied the lands since the 1967 middle east war 
husseini an activist who supports the palestine liberation 
organization told his audience it was better israelis and 
palestinians had a dialogue rather than a monologue 
husseini a native arabic speaker on several occasions turned 
to the three israelis on the panel for help with a hebrew word and 
once the audience shouted one for him matarot meaning 
targets or goals 
it has not been easy for us to say we dont want to continue 
with the same antiisraeli war with the same targets of our 
fathers he said 
husseini appealed to israel to talk to the palestinian people 
as a people not as a minority not as residents of some place not 
as refugees 
husseini has made a series of appearances before jewish 
audiences to try to explain the palestinian goal for an independent 
state 
as the audience gathered for the speech at jerusalems van leer 
institute about 40 rightwing israelis waved banners and shouted 
slogans against husseini they included activists from the kach 
party of americanborn rabbi meir kahane who carried signs reading 
deport husseini now and arab murderer out 
israel radio said a bomb threat was received before the talk but 
police searched the building and no bomb was found 
army gunfire wounded at least seven palestinians in clashes in

a governmentsponsored study indicates that 
high doses of fluoride may cause cancer in male rats but public 
health officials cautioned tuesday that the findings are 
preliminary 
officials also said the findings do not suggest that 
toothdecayfighting fluoride in drinking water and toothpaste 
could cause cancer in humans 
the findings must be evaluated and given final scientific peer 
review before conclusions can be drawn said jim brown a 
spokesman for the public health service such a meeting is 
scheduled for april 26 
it should be noted that all previous studies including those 
by the national cancer institute the centers for disease control 
the national heart lung and blood institute as well as studies 
done in canada england australia new zealand and norway show no 
linkage between ingested fluoride and mortality from cancer in 
humans he said 
in the study conducted by the national toxicological program 
1360 mice and rats were fed water containing sodium fluoride four 
male rats given high doses got bone cancer none of the female 
rats nor any of the male or female mice in the study was found to 
have contracted cancer at any of the four doses given 
the high doses contained fluoride in far greater amounts than 
humans are exposed to in toothpaste and water brown said

fifteen businesses went to state court 
tuesday to overturn the nations toughest sunday closing laws 
saying they are vague selectively enforced and unconstitutional 
you cannot discriminate among businesses giving some special 
privileges and not affording those to others and were saying that 
this law does this said john olson a bismarck attorney 
representing the businesses 
the lawsuit filed in south central district court in bismarck 
follows unsuccessful attempts to persuade the state legislature to 
overhaul sundayclosing laws which have existed in some form since 
statehood 100 years ago 
it is evident from what is happening nationally and globally 
that north dakotas economy will not grow by restricting 
business said dale anderson president of the greater north 
dakota association the states chamber of commerce which is 
backing the lawsuit 
attorney general nicholas spaeth said he personally favors 
sunday shopping but that his own opinion will not prevent him from 
defending the law 
its an important and difficult case and our office will 
defend the present law vigorously spaeth said in a statement 
the law lists 44 items that may not legally be sold sunday 
except under some limited circumstances like rummage sales the 
list includes cameras shoes cars and trucks lawnmowers and 
clothing other than work gloves and infant supplies 
the law also lists 37 types of businesses that may open on 
sunday including grocery and convenience stores but it does not 
include department stores forcing north dakotas shopping malls 
and other retail outlets to close 
west acres development which owns north dakotas largest 
shopping mall is one of the 15 plantiffs in the lawsuit the 
companys controller brad schlossman said stores in the fargo 
mall are penalized because they must remain closed while other 
stores selling similar items are open sundays 
that isnt fair he said 
schlossman said the state would get an estimated 20 million in 
tax revenue over a twoyear period from sunday sales 
so if retailers win the whole state wins he added 
north dakota is one of eight states with some form of law 
restricting sunday sales according to the national retail 
merchants association most of the other states restrict liquor 
sales while louisiana restricts the sale of cars on sundays 
olson who is also a republican state senator said the north 
dakota law not only is discriminatory but also is very very 
confusing for example he said it is unclear whether the ban on 
selling work gloves extends to winter gloves 
when you have the clerk thats staffing the till at the 
checkout line in the store that person has to make those decisions 
on the spot olson said 
a clerk who illegally sells an item could be convicted of a 
misdemeanor with a maxium penalty of 30 days in jail and a 500 
fine he said 
the lawsuit also contends north dakotas laws unfairly restrict 
interstate commerce and inject religion into state lawmaking 
no date for a hearing on the lawsuit has been set 
the 15 businesses are in fargo grand forks wahpeton 
jamestown bismarck and minot and include a bismarck real estate 
broker a jamestown car dealer and a grand forks hardware store 
olson unsuccessfully sponsored legislation last year to overhaul 
north dakotas blue laws 
sundayclosing laws have been challenged previously in north 
dakota courts but recent decisions in other state courts and the 
us supreme court have added weight to the argument against them 
olson said 
we have a much better chance of prevailing in 1990 than we 
would have 10 or 20 years ago he said

more than 6000 ethnic albanians 
chanting democracy clashed with riot police tuesday in 
podujevo and five people were reported killed as protests spread 
across kosovo province 
many companies stopped work on the seventh day of unrest in 
kosovo 
the deaths brought to 13 the number of officially reported 
deaths since clashes began jan 24 in the ethnically troubled 
region 
radio pristina reported the deaths of two ethnic albanians in 
malisevo a town 40 miles outside pristina and police sources 
later reported a policeman was seriously wounded there in an ambush 
by ethnic albanians who fired at a passing column of police 
vehicles 
belgrade televison reported that police shot and killed three 
other ethnic albanian demonstrators in two other small towns the 
reports could not be independently confirmed 
the police sources also said local ethnic albanian police 
refused orders to intervene during a small demonstration at goles 
10 miles northwest of the provincial capital the first such 
instance of disobedience since the unrest began 
the report could not be verified independently the sources 
spoke on the condition of anonymity 
about 30000 people gathered in the town of urosevac for the 
funeral of one of those killed earlier 
demonstrators in several cities and towns defied government 
demands that they end protest marches strikes were reported at 
several factories in support of the protesters 
in podujevo a city 20 miles north of pristina riot police 
fired hundreds of tear gas rounds at the mostly young demonstrators 
who covered their faces with scarves there was no report on 
casualties 
the ethnic albanians are demanding free elections lifting of a 
yearold state of emergency release of political prisoners and an 
end to political trials 
armed riot police some in helicopters used clubs and a water 
cannon to battle stonethrowing demonstrators throughout the 
province monday night 
yugoslavias collective state presidency and the government 
issued separate statements monday both describing the kosovo 
situation as extremely grave the statements promised 
resolute action to stop the demonstrators 
demonstrations also were reported in orahovac kosovska vitina 
and several other towns in the province 
the ethnic albanians began rioting last year after the serbian 
republic of which kosovo is an autonomous province made 
constitutional changes to take tighter control of the region 
ethnic albanians make up about 90 percent of the impoverished 
southern provinces population and they are predominantly moslem 
the minority christian serbs say moslems in kosovo want to force 
them out and then join neighboring albania 
for the first time in kosovo serbs and the ethnic albanians 
were reported confronting each other in kosovska vitina on tuesday 
riot police positioned themselves between the two angry groups 
which numbred hundreds on each side 
previously such confrontations were avoided but last week an 
organization of kosovo serbs demanded that the authorities 
distribute weapons so they could protect themselves 
a number of serbian villages have organized vigilante patrols 
armed with shotguns and pistols in what they say is an effort to 
defend their homes 
the situation has never been so bad in history a guntoting 
serb in the village of donja gusterica told reporters 
in belgrade the federal capital and capital of serbia 
thousands of students rallied late tuesday in an antialbanian 
demonstration 
we shall give our lives but not kosovo they chanted 
federal deputy premier zivko pregl and interior minister gen 
petar gacanin met in pristina on tuesday to discuss the 
deteriorating situation in the province with local communist 
authorities

three times as many americans die yearly from 
industrial accidents in confined spaces as from commercial air 
crashes but the government has stalled on drafting rules to save 
workers lives federal officials were told tuesday 
relatives of five men who suffocated or were poisoned in three 
chemicaltank accidents testified before a panel of us labor 
department officials about how the disasters might have been 
averted if standards proposed years earlier had been in effect 
our government has failed us said phil claypool father of 
one of the victims 
his testimony came in the last of three public hearings on rules 
proposed by the departments occupational safety and health 
administration previous hearings were held late last year in 
washington and houston 
stephen r jones one of the four labor department officials on 
the panel said his agency hopes to finish drafting rules by the 
end of the year 
three hundred workers die each year from suffocation poisoning 
drowning and injuries in confined industrial spaces such as 
refinery tanks tunnels sewers and grain elevators according to a 
1976 estimate by the national institute for occupational safety and 
health 
in contrast from 1980 to 1988 us commercial air crashes 
claimed an average of 105 people per year according to figures 
submitted at the hearing and attributed to the national 
transportation safety board 
denise grad 29 of suburban south holland told the panel 
tuesday how her 32yearold husband tony was suffocated by 
nitrogen in a tank car in may 1988 while working for a waste hauler 
in matteson south of chicago 
when he looked to go in there he had no idea it had been 
cleaned out with nitrogen said mrs grad choked by tears he 
was always very careful it was one thing he was noted for 
mrs grad who has a 2yearold son called for stricter 
labeling to protect workers from unknowingly entering confined 
spaces filled with potentially fatal gases and for required rescue 
procedures and equipment

group capt fw winterbotham who played a key 
role in exploiting broken german codes in world war ii and wrote 
the bestselling memoir the ultra secret has died british news 
reports said tuesday he was 92 
he died peacefully at home on sunday the accounts said 
frederick william winterbotham was a pilot in world war i and 
in 1929 was made head of aerial intelligence in mi6 the british 
intelligence agency 
in the 1930s he managed to befriend senior nazi figures in 
germany and glean information about the luftwaffe in 1939 he 
helped devise a vital new method of aerial reconnaissance 
photography 
but his most important work was with enigma the topsecret 
german code system that the british had managed to penetrate 
winterbothams job was to get the information from enigma or 
ultra intelligence as it was known to commanders in the field 
without revealing to the germans their code had been cracked he 
worked out a system that was successful throughout the war and did 
not become public knowledge until the 1970s 
his work made him a confidant of wartime prime minister winston 
churchill but he remained an unsung war hero because the cracking 
of enigma was considered so secret it was not revealed for 30 years 
after the war when winterbotham published the ultra secret 
winterbotham was married twice and had four children

a coalition of banished haitian leaders 
tuesday urged the united states to join an international effort to 
remove lt gen prosper avril from power through military and 
economic sanctions 
the group saying it represents all haitians silenced by avrils 
regime of terror rejected avrils announcement monday that he 
was restoring civil and press liberties to the impoverished island 
after a weeklong crackdown against opposition activists 
we believe that there is no possibility under any 
circumstances to resume the democratic process with prosper avril 
avril must go the four leaders said in a statement issued after 
a meeting with the congressional task force on haiti 
avril rose to power in a 1988 coup led by noncommissioned 
officers who professed disgust with state terrorism under ousted 
lt gen henri namphy 
avril promised elections for october but critics say he has no 
intention of fulfilling his promise despite pressure from the 
united states france and other governments 
the exiles accused the united states of propping up dictatorial 
regimes in haiti for more than 30 years under the pretext of 
fighting communism in the caribbean 
we ask the united states now to pay attention to 6 million 
haitians said antoine izmery a prominent civic leader exiled 
last week 
izmery said avril had worked for the cia and betrayed the united 
states as did former panamanian dictator manuel antonio noriega 
its time for the united states to face its true 
responsibilities izmery said 
louis roy an architect of haitis constitution who was 
arrested beaten and banished last week said haiti would not 
condone a panamalike invasion to remove avril but that other 
steps could be effective 
pressure by the united states will succeed if its strong 
enough and accompanied by threats that they mean business said 
the 74yearold leader 
us pressure he said helped end the harsh 27year duvalier 
dynasty when presidentforlife jeanclaude duvalier fled to exile 
in france in february 1986 
asked what kind of threats the united states should make roy 
said military and economic but he did not elaborate 
the united states has suspended all aid to the haitian 
government although it provides humanitarian assistance to the 
haitian people through private organizations

scientists got their first look at a 
rescued science satellite tuesday and said they were delighted 
with its condition despite some wear and tear from six years in 
space 
wearing contaminationproof clothing and standing on an 
observation platform several feet away scientists watched as the 
shuttle columbias 60footlong cargo bay doors opened to reveal 
the long duration exposure facility 
the opening of the doors was the first step toward removing the 
11ton ldef with a large crane placing it in an airtight canister 
and moving it from the shuttle processing facility to a sterilized 
building several miles away for close examination the work was 
expected to last much of the night 
columbias astronauts retrieved the laboratory 200 miles out in 
space jan 12 snaring it just weeks before it was to drop into the 
atmosphere and die a fiery death 
ldef project chief william h kinard trained binoculars on the 
satellite tuesday and said it appeared to be a little more 
weathered than pictures taken in space indicated 
there are lots of small micrometeoroid craters kinard said 
he said there was some discoloration and foil covering some 
experiments had been torn 
but thats why we sent it up there to find out what happens 
to materials after a long time in the space environment kinard 
said were delighted with the condition 
there are 57 experiments attached to ldefs exterior and 
scientists and engineers want to see how the various materials in 
them fared during their long exposure to radiation micrometeoroids 
and other phenomena in space 
the experiments will yield information that will be valuable in 
designing future longduration spacecraft including the freedom 
manned space station to be assembled in orbit in the mid1990s 
four teams will study the recovered laboratory for about three 
weeks photographing it and jotting down their observations the 
teams are composed of specialists in space debris materials 
spacecraft systems and radiation 
starting in midfebruary the experiments will be covered with 
protective aluminum and removed one by one from the satellites 
racks they will be delivered to scientists throughout the nation 
and western europe for detailed study 
the satellite has 21 materials coating and thermal systems 
experiments five power and propulsion experiments 17 science 
experiments and 14 optics and electronic experiments they involve 
more than 200 investigators from 33 companies 21 universities 
seven national aeronautics and space administration centers and 
eight foreign countries 
also aboard are 125 million tomato seeds a few will be planted 
in research labs 
however most will be sent to schools where students in grades 5 
through university level will plant water and nurture the seeds to 
research such things as germination rates and genetics

baltic separatists say they have arranged 
an unusual attempt to resolve bloody strife in the caucasus because 
that conflict could jeopardize their own peaceful drive for 
democracy 
after a week of intense work baltic peoples front leaders said 
armenians and azerbaijanis have agreed to meet in riga capital of 
latvia 
representatives of the armenian allnational movement and the 
peoples front of azerbaijan are tentatively scheduled to meet 
thursday but travel problems could delay the discussions 
the mediation effort is unusual because it bypasses the kremlin 
and president mikhail s gorbachev who has tried unsuccessfully to 
end the bitter confrontation between armenia and azerbaijan 
a moscow report tuesday by the cable news network meanwhile said 
gorbachev has spent the last eight days considering his 
resignation as chief of the communist party and could resign when 
the policysetting central committee meets next monday and tuesday 
while still retaining the presidency of the soviet union it said 
gorbachev would be following popular pressure to remove the party 
from its monopoly control of political power 
the official soviet news agency tass late tuesday said nothing 
of any such plans and later us television newscasts from moscow 
including those by nbc and cbs expressed skepticism 
nbc commented on gorbachevs problems in azerbaijan and his 
struggles with perestroika or restructuring in its report on the 
resignation speculation 
the soviet government sent troops to azerbaijan and there have 
been nearly 200 deaths in the latest round of ethnic violence in 
the region 
the situation in the caucasus threatens the development of 
democracy in the soviet union as a whole and talks could be a 
constructive beginning said ints upmacis a lawyer and one of 
three mediators from the latvian peoples front 
sending soviet soldiers to the azerbaijani capital of baku on 
jan 20 was kind of a halfstep forward to introducing the army 
into all of the soviet union said romas razukas a latvian 
peoples front member responsible for organizing the talks this 
precedent seemed very dangerous to us 
peoples fronts from latvias baltic neighbors lithuania to the 
south and estonia to the north also are sending mediators 
the negotiations mark the first time that nonofficial 
organizations will take such a leading role in trying to settle a 
national soviet issue if successful the effort could enhance the 
prestige of the baltic movements already in the forefront of the 
soviet reform effort 
in moscow vyacheslav a mikhailov the no 2 official of the 
communist party central committees ethnic relations department 
told reporters tuesday he was unaware of the riga talks but that 
the kremlin would support anything that helps resolve the conflict 
and ends bloodshed 
the latvians also see potential political gain in elections 
scheduled march 18 
we obviously have humanitarian intentions but this initiative 
could have great profit for us politically as well said razukas 
we have elections to the latvia supreme soviet coming up and 
this initiative shows that the lativian peoples front is 
peaceful 
the idea for a baltic initiative was a direct result of the 
soviet military intervention in azerbaijan according to official 
sources 197 people have been killed since the violence began 
including 125 since the military moved into baku 
on monday the estonian peoples front issued a declaration 
protesting the use of military force said marju lauristen a 
leader of the estonian peoples front in an interview from her home 
in tartu this move cannot be interpreted as help for the 
armenians it is obviously a military move against the azerbaijani 
peoples drive for liberation 
the baltic states also are concerned about the fate of soldiers 
from their region who are part of the military force 
we think there are at least 500 latvian troops taking part in 
the occupation and all the baltic countries are interested in 
resolution of the conflict because there are troops from here 
said upmacis 
the peoples front movements in all three baltic republics 
insist that the quest for democracy and independence must be 
peaceful and rely on parliamentary methods 
they hope that in their role as mediators they can pursuade the 
independence movements in the caucaus to adopt a similar strategy 
we will ask them to use diplomacy and follow a parliamentary 
way we want them to understand how much we have achieved through 
those means said razukas 
serious efforts to organize the armenianazerbaijani talks began 
jan 23 but communication by telephone or telegram with armenian 
and azerbaijani activists thousands of miles away required 
aroundtheclock effort and tremendous patience razukas said 
the biggest obstacle to arranging talks was the territorial 
dispute over the region of nagornokarabakh an armenian enclave 
located inside azerbaijan the armenian population and the armenian 
republic want nagornokarabakh annexed but azerbaijan has resisted 
the idea 
after days of negotiations the two sides agreed that 
territorial disputes would not be on the agenda however one of 
the armenian negotiators rafael popoyan said that the armenians 
wanted to discuss selfdetermination of ethnic groups which 
amounts to much the same thing 
the two sides hve agreed to discuss three main issues the 
introduction and presence of soviet troops in baku and other parts 
of azerbaija and armenia the problem of refugees and other 
humanitarian issues

a woman suspected of killing two infant 
daughters she claimed had been abducted was found guilty of 
firstdegree murder tuesday in the slaying of one of them 
paula marie sims 30 shed no tears as the guilty verdict was 
read to her but she later broke down as guards led her back to 
jail 
the jury will begin deliberations wednesday as to whether or not 
mrs sims should face the death penalty 
jurors deliberated 10 hours over two days before returning the 
verdict against the woman in the suffocation of 6weekold heather 
lee heather was one of two infant daughters mrs sims reported 
abducted by a masked gunman under nearly identical circumstances 
three years apart 
madison county prosecutor donald weber called it the hardest 
case i ever had to try he said he thought the jury was strongly 
influenced by evidence that mrs sims and her husband robert 
wanted only male children 
she didnt like little girls and neither did robert said 
weber 
the father has not been charged in either case but weber said 
because of the verdict against mrs sims the states attorneys 
offices in madison and jerey counties are considering seeking grand 
jury indictments against the 37yearold man 
robert sims and defense attorney donald groshong declined 
comment 
mrs sims looked somber as the jury returned and once appeared 
to wince as the verdict was read she sat stoic with her eyes fixed 
to the table in front of her 
she didnt look up as the jurors were polled to confirm their 
guilty verdicts nor when they filed passed her and the silver 
trash barrel and plastic garbage bag where the body of heather lee 
was discovered last may 3 
the jury found mrs sims guilty of one count of firstdegree 
murder two counts of obstructing justice and one count of 
concealing a homicide 
mrs sims had been charged with two counts of murder to allow 
prosecutors to propose different theories in heathers death and 
jurors consolidated the counts upon conviction weber said 
weber will try to show the jury wednesday that mrs sims crime 
qualifies her for capital punishment because the victim was under 
12 and the defendants conduct was especially brutal and cruel 
if she qualifies for the death penalty a hearing will be held 
on the actual penalty which could vary from death by injection to 
imprisonment 
mrs sims also has been implicated in the 1986 death of her 
firstborn 13dayold loralei marie in jersey county no murder 
charges have been filed in that case 
mrs sims faces trial in jersey county on charges of obstruction 
of justice and concealment of a homicide in loraleis death 
she reported that in june 1986 a masked gunman entered her home 
while she was watching television made her lie on the floor and 
fled with loralei a body believed to be that of the infant was 
found a week later near the family home in the rural jersey county 
town of brighton where they lived at the time 
on april 29 1989 mrs sims reported that a masked gunman 
approached her as she took out the garbage and ordered her back 
into the house in the madison county city of alton where the 
family had moved she said he knocked her unconscious and that when 
she awoke she found heather gone 
heathers body was found may 3 in a garbage can across the 
mississippi river in nearby west alton mo 
mrs sims has been jailed since the murder charges were filed in 
july her husband has had custody of the couples son randy who 
turns 2 thursday

fortynine leftist guerrillas including 
several who tried to kill president augusto pinochet in 1986 
escaped from a downtown jail tuesday through a tunnel they spent a 
year digging officials said 
authorities said six of the escapees were quickly captured by 
police but the others remained at large prison officials said 
one other prisoner proved too big for the tunnels entrance and 
was found stuck in it they said 
horacio ojeda director of the national prison system said the 
inmates dug a tunnel about 100 yards long and 20 inches wide from a 
cell block to a nearby lot where a subway station was being 
constructed the tunnel passed under a busy road 
the escape was discovered at 230 am ojeda said 
several hours later a man who identified himself as one of the 
escapees called radio cooperativa in santiago with details of the 
operation 
the man said construction of the tunnel took more than a year 
and that 24 inmates took part in planning and carrying out the 
escape 
the tunnel has a ventilation system operated with blowers 
the man said it has electric light and a rail system we used to 
take out the removed material 
after we left the tunnel remained open and we think it was 
used by other prisoners who were not part of our plan the caller 
added 
the details desribed by the caller coincided with what reporters 
saw at the prison 
the entrance to the tunnel was inside a cell the inmates used a 
heavy cement block to cover the hole and hide it from the prison 
guards 
ojeda described all the escapees as leftists and said several 
were convicted in a sept 7 1986 ambush of pinochets motorcade 
southeast of santiago 
pinochet was unhurt but five bodyguards were killed and 11 
wounded in the attack carried out by the procommunist manuel 
rodriguez patriotic front 
pinochet took power following a 1973 coup that topped elected 
president salvador allende he is scheduled to turn over power to a 
civilian government in february 
other escapees were front members implicated in the smuggling of 
more than 30 tons of rifles rockets bazookas grenades and other 
weapons into the country in august 1986 ojeda said 
a list of the escapees disclosed by prison authorities includes 
several top commanders of the guerrilla organization some belonged 
to other leftist groups 
according to a local organization of prisoners relatives four 
of the escapees had been sentenced to death but were awaiting the 
outcome of appeals three were convicted in the pinochet 
assassination attempt and the other for killing a policeman

the communist party on tuesday 
handed over more than 100 of its parliamentary seats to 
prodemocracy groups to end its fourdecade hold on the nations 
legislature 
also tuesday the foreign ministry announced czechoslovakia and 
israel are expected to restore diplomatic ties on feb 8 when 
foreign minister moshe arens of israel visits this capital 
czechoslovakia one of israels strongest supporters after the 
jewish state was founded in 1948 broke off ties over objections to 
the 1967 arabisraeli war 
the realignment of parliament completed an effort to include 
czechoslovakias emerging reform groups in the federal assembly 
before free elections scheduled for june 8 
it was the latest abdication of communist power following a 
popular revolution in november 
parliament swore in 120 new deputies only nine of them 
communists under an agreement by various parties and the 
opposition to replace more than onethird of the 350member 
parliament 
the action sliced the communists representation from 242 to 
139 marking the first time since the late 1940s that the 
communists have not dominated the legislature 
all but nine of the new seats went to the opposition and other 
established political parties 
more than 40 political parties have emerged in the two months 
since parliament removed the constitutional provision guaranteeing 
the communist partys leading role 
the realignment came following broad talks between the 
prodemocracy leaders the communists and four traditionally allied 
parties 
earlier several discredited communist deputies were asked to 
resign and were replaced by candidates of the civic forum a loose 
reform coalition 
deputy zdenek jicinsky one of the new civic forum deputies and 
a constitutional lawyer once forced to work in menial jobs for his 
human rights activities on tuesday presented a draft election law 
to the legislature 
the legislation requires final approval from the countrys new 
noncommunist president vaclav havel 
the draft proposes the principle of proportional representation 
in the elections with several limitation clauses 
although jicinsky did not give precise figures in his 
presentation civic forum sources indicate a minimum of 10000 
supporters and 5 percent of the total national vote will be 
required for a party to put a member in parliament 
petr pithart another newly elected deputy and a leader of the 
civic forum said he expected six to seven new political parties 
would be elected into parliament

whose two years of captivity gripped italy was freed tuesday night 
police said a military patrol found casella 20 chained by the 
wrist and the neck to a post near a bridge in the aspromonte 
mountain area of southern italy where he was believed held by the 
anonymous kidnappers italys notorious kidnap ring 
the italian news agency ansa said the youth told police he was 
left chained to the post by kidnappers who told him to remain calm 
that sooner or later someone would pass by and free him 
the youth was examined by a doctor found to be exhausted by his 
imprisonment but in good condition police said 
ansa said his first request was for food 
give me something to eat i havent eaten for three days 
the agency quoted him as telling the military patrol 
casella had become a symbol of the plight of kidnap victims in 
italy his mother angela casella was known as mother courage 
because she traveled to aspromonte to make dramatic appeals and to 
protest the kidnapping and government inaction 
she made her first trip of hope to the aspromonte region of 
calabria in october 1988 and returned for 10 days last june 
sleeping in a tent as my son is doing in these months 
her complaints led to the resignations of all 42 mayors of the 
aspromonte area near locri in sympathy with her complaints 
cesare is that you is that really you she said in a 
choking voice when she spoke to him by telephone for the first time 
since he was kidnapped 
yes yes mama it is me he replied 
casella abducted in the northern town of pavia on jan 18 
1988 was released near the site of a christmas eve shootout 
between the carbinieri italys paramilitary police and kidnappers 
who had come to collect the second installment of the ransom 
police said one of the kidnappers was wounded and captured 
during the shootout but two others escaped 
after the release of casella five people are thought to be in 
the hands of the kidnap gangs including patrizia tacchella 
8yearold daughter of imerio tacchella coowner of the sportsware 
manufacturing company carrera she has been missing more than a 
day feared kidnapped from near her home in verona 
casella whose father luigi owns a citroen dealership had been 
one of the longest held kidnap victims in italy his father 
reportedly paid the 1 billion lire 800000 ransom demanded by 
the kidappers in august of 1988 and his release appeared imminent 
but despite the payment and emotional appeals by the mother the 
youth remained a prisoner it was not until early 1989 that the 
kidnappers responded demanding a second payment of 5 billion lire 
4 million 
the kidnappers did not provide any proof the youth was still 
alive until september when they sent a picture of him holding the 
sept 3 edition of a local newspaper 
on nov 10 a friend of the family received a letter from the 
youth on christmas eve the carabinieri took a sack of ransom money 
to a drop site but the transaction ended in a shootout and the 
capture of one of the kidnappers

prime minister geoffrey palmer said 
tuesday that officials had found no evidence to support claims by 
greenpeace that a philippine vessel planned to supply a japanese 
driftnet fleet 
he said the investigation was continuing however 
new zealand and many other south pacific nations oppose 
driftnet fishing environmentalists say the huge nets trap 
virtually everything they cover and could decimate marine life 
earlier tuesday greenpeace said it made a citizens arrest 
by tying the philippine ship we carrier with heavy chain at 
auckland harbor 
greenpeace said it acted after intercepting radio messages at 
sea in which a japanese control ship told other vessels in the 
driftnet fleet to meet the philippine tanker to refuel 
ministry of agriculture and fisheries inspectors searched the 
tanker but found no evidence to corroborate greenpeaces claims 
palmer said in a statement he said officials of the ministry of 
external relations and trade were investigating 
palmer said the government would be reluctant to take action 
without evidence 
it is very unfortunate that greenpeace is unable to produce 
firsthand evidence of the radio communications they overheard he 
said it seems that tape recordings were accidentally wiped 
however if evidence suggests the tanker was supporting the 
driftnet fleet palmer said he would ask the auckland company to 
withdraw its arrangements with the vessel 
at a meeting in wellington in november 20 south pacific nations 
endorsed a pact aimed at banning the huge drift nets in their 
waters under the wellington driftnet convention nations can 
prohibit port access to driftnet vessels and to ships that supply 
driftnet fleets 
palmer said his government was preparing legislation to carry 
out the conventions provisions 
greenpeace claimed the we carrier was preparing to resupply a 
fleet of 20 japanese drift netters in the tasman sea wednesday 
we took this action as a continuation of our tasman sea 
driftnets expedition against japan and taiwan said greenpeace 
driftnets campaigner mike hagler the resupply of the japanese 
fleet must be stopped if we are to stop the driftnet slaughter 
of whales and dolphins and the decimation of the south pacific 
albacore tuna stocks 
the group said it feared hundreds of whales and thousands of 
dolphins would be killed before the end of the fivemonth fishing 
season in april

a man investigated in the mail bomb 
slayings last month of a federal judge and a civil rights attorney 
gave samples of his blood saliva and hair to the fbi on tuesday 
robert wayne oferrell accompanied by his attorney was taken 
by police to a hospital where he spent 45 minutes providing 
samples requested in a federal grand jury subpoena issued last week 
emerging from the hospital oferrell said he was happy to 
comply with the subpoena and told reporters he has cooperated with 
the investigation since the fbi arrived in this southeast alabama 
city on jan 22 
his attorney paul harden said the fbi did not tell him what 
they planned to do with the samples 
oferrell a 46yearold enterprise junk dealer has been 
questioned extensively in the fbis investigation of the slayings 
of 11th us circuit court of appeals judge robert vance of 
birmingham and robert robinson an naacp attorney from savannah ga 
similar package bombs were discovered and defused at the 11th 
circuit courthouse in atlanta and the jacksonville fla chapter 
of the national association for the advancement of colored people 
agents have confiscated typewriters from oferrell federal 
sources speaking on condition of anonymity have said the printing 
on the bombers letters matched that on a 1988 letter oferrell 
wrote to the 11th circuit concerning a case he lost before the 
court 
agents last week searched oferrells home and business and 
pumped out his septic tanks looking for evidence the fbi has 
refused to say whether it found any clues but dozens of agents 
remain in southeast alabama 
in another development a pipe bomb mailed to a church in 
houston exploded tuesday morning injuring lisa osteen the 
30yearold daughter of the pastor the rev john osteen 
charles b kearney an fbi spokesman in houston said there did 
not appear to be any similarities between the texas bomb and the 
december mail bombs 
however oferrell and harden said the houston bombing should 
demonstrate that oferrell had nothing to do with any of the 
attacks 
its a sad state of affairs but it does in my mind show wayne 
oferrell who has been in enterprise since day one is in no way 
shape or form involved harden said

poland applied tuesday for full 
membership in the 23nation council of europe the oldest postwar 
organization for european unity 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki announced polands application 
in a speech to the councils assembly the council of europe 
which has performed wonders in the defense of rights and freedoms 
and which is a rich fountainhead of european ideas and initiatives 
seems the right place for poland 
poland which has had observer status in the organization since 
june 8 is the second east european nation to apply for membership 
of the strasbourgbased council hungary following poland with its 
own democratic reforms applied on nov 16 
set up in 1949 the council is a political organization 
particularly active in human rights and legal and cultural 
cooperation and is separate from the european community membership 
is open only to european countries that have a democratic and 
pluralistic parliament 
addressing this issue mazowiecki said that although poland was 
confronted with the enormous task of reconstituting the rights 
and the institutions which characterize modern democracies 
poland has already set to work 
he stressed his government had drafted and enacted laws for the 
independence of the judiciary for freedom of the press freedom to 
organize and found political parties and for local selfgovernment 
the polish premier appealed for help in the huge job facing 
eastern and central europe to fill in the gulf between poor 
europe and affluent europe 
he said we now need new guidelines to point our endeavors down 
a common european road to noones exclusion and everyones 
advantage 
but unlike his counterpart from hungary miklos nemeth who on 
monday also addressed the council of europe saying his country was 
paying particular attention to its relations with the 12nation 
european community mazowiecki hinted that membership in the ec was 
not upcoming for poland 
europe at the turn of the century would certainly not be a 
european area with free movement of goods capital and people 
nor a europe with a common currency he said referring to the 
ecs plans to achieve a single market by the end of 1992 and its 
longerterm plans for monetary union 
instead he said the time had come to establish institutions 
genuinely encompassing the whole of europe

bush administration officials said they could 
not confirm a broadcast report tuesday that soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev was considering relinquishing his post as head of 
the soviet communist party 
all i can tell you is that its a rumor and therefore 
its not something that i think that we should respond to or react 
to secretary of state james a baker iii told reporters after 
the report was aired by cable news network 
baker spoke as an aide announced a rescheduling of talks in 
moscow with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze and said 
the oneday delay was to avoid interfering with a meeting of the 
communist party central committee baker will be in moscow feb 
89 said spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
were following the story as i know you are and well have a 
comment if we ever determine its something more than just a 
rumor baker said of the cnn account 
cnn quoting a wellinformed and usually reliable party 
source said from moscow that the reemergence of gorbachev on 
telvision on tuesday did not rule out a dramatic resignation when 
the policysetting central committee meets next monday and tuesday 
before the tv appearance on tuesday gorbachev was last seen in 
public jan 20 explaining why soviet troops had been sent to the 
azerbaijan republic 
according to the unnamed source gorbachev had resisted sending 
troops into baku the capital of the republic and was suffering 
severe depression over the action cnn said 
white house chief of staff john sununu told reporters the 
administration has been trying for the last few hours to try and 
get some additional assessments but i dont have anything at all 
we would like to understand the details of whats involved and 
whats implied if such a change has taken place he said and 
frankly at the time were talking here i dont know if its 
correct 
bush administration officials and intelligence sources speaking 
on condition of anonymity said there has been speculation for 
weeks that gorbachev would yield his party post while retaining 
the presidency but that they had no information he would take the 
step 
one senior administration official said that if true the 
decision might mean that theres a move toward pluralism in mind 
it might mean theres a problem it might be a plus and very 
frankly you can create scenarios on both sides you can make an 
argument that its a reflection of strength and you can make an 
argument that its a reflection of weakness 
sen david boren dokla senate chairman of the senate 
intelligence commitee said he had no confirmation of the report 
but if true it may in fact enhance gorbachevs chances for 
survival by making it more difficult for party bosses opposed to 
his policies to criticize him 
ever since his assumption of the top party post in 1985 
ghorbachev has sought to separate the party and the government the 
party has ruled the country since the 1917 revolution with the 
government a distinctly secondary entity 
sen richard lugar rind a senior member of the foreign 
relations committee said he had no independent knowledge of 
gorbachevs plans but that a resignation as party leader would 
represent an important loss of power for the soviet leader and 
throw uncertainty into ussoviet relations 
senate majority leader bob dole rkan said the report should 
mean caution about cutting military spending lets call off this 
mad rush to spend a dividend we dont even have yet 
baker said american diplomats in moscow know just about the 
same thing that all the rest of us know right now that theres a 
rumor out there to this effect and thats all we know 
he said his talks in moscow were still very much on 
asked about the cnn report white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said i have no idea weve never heard of it before i 
have no information 
he said of the baker trip to moscow it was just delayed one 
day 
baker and shevardnadze will meet feb 89 in the soviet capital 
a day delay at the suggestion of the us government said ms 
tutwiler the state department spokeswoman 
issues to be discussed include arms control and the war in 
afghanistan between the sovietbacked government and usarmed 
rebels 
it simply makes more sense to have the soviets complete their 
plenum before beginning this important ministerial ms tutwiler 
said 
baker also is expected to make a brief visit to czechoslovakia 
although there has been no announcement on that 
one us official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
there have been reports that gorbachev was frustrated over efforts 
to reform the communist party he said the speculation was that 
gorbachev would remain in charge of the government as president a 
post he has strengthened 
however he stressed there was no information to the effect that 
gorbachev would take the step 
another administration official said jack matlock jr the us 
ambassador to moscow had been asked about the cnn report and 
replied he was unaware of any such development 
the intelligence sources said the report was given impetus by 
bakers schedule change 
meanwhile the report caused turmoil on wall street and a 
negative reaction on capitol hill 
stock prices were so volatile after the cnn report aired that 
one investment brokerage stopped trading temporarily while the 
market calmed down 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials fell immediately after 
the gorbachev report but quickly recovered finishing down 1014 on 
a day when prices were also pushed downward by congressional 
testimony from federal reserve chairman alan greenspan

angolan rebel leader jonas savimbi cut 
short a tour of western europe tuesday saying the government 
launched a major air offensive against strongholds of his unita 
guerrillas in that southern african state 
he told a lisbon news conference sovietsupplied mig and sukhoi 
warplanes began bombing unita positions in southeast angola monday 
between the kuzumbia river and the rebel base of mavinga about 685 
miles southeast of luanda 
savimbi called the raids the biggest since civil war began in 
1975 between his usbacked rebels and the marxist government that 
took power when angola gained independence from portugal 
its the first time in 14 years that weve had these sweeping 
raids he said with up to 14 planes being used in single attacks 
a government official contacted by telephone tuesday in luanda 
angolas capital declined to comment about air raids but said 
forces under president jose eduardo dos santos were creating 
serious problems for the rebels 
savimbi had arrived in lisbon saturday for an eightday visit 
planning to go on to west germany belgium and switzerland 
despite the raids he hinted that chances for restarting stalled 
peace talks were increased by his visit here 
there are movements again to start negotiations he said 
he said portugal agreed to help as a link between unita the 
national union for the total independence of angola and the 
luanda government 
savimbi said that for the first time angola used sophisticated 
sukhoi25 ground attack planes supplied by the soviets last year 
he said about 11000 civilians lived in the area under attack 
the rebels shot down two migs and captured two pilots savimbi 
claimed 
the united states supplies the rebels with stinger groundtoair 
missiles among a reported 50 million of us military aid send 
yearly to unita 
the rebel leader said mavinga was in no danger of falling to 
government forces and that bush headquarters at jamba was not 
affected by the bombing 
in luanda on tuesday a military official said mavinga was 
surrounded and could fall soon 
the staterun news media made no mention tuesday of any fighting 
in the south 
savimbi said he will return to organize ground defenses along 
the lomba river an important natural barrier protecting rebel 
territory in the southeast 
savimbis visit to portugal was the first since angola became 
independent portuguese authorities earlier refused to grant him a 
visa 
during his stay he met president mario soares and prime 
minister anibal cavaco silva he suggested the raids were meant to 
counteract what he said was the public relations success of his 
visit 
efforts to reach a peaceful solution have floundered since a 
ceasefire sealed by a handshake between savimbi and dos santos 
last june in gbadolite zaire broke down amid renewed fighting 
cavaco silvas centerright government has built up warm 
relations with the luanda government and has recently begun 
highlevel talks with unita 
the united states has also stepped up diplomatic efforts to 
break the deadlock 
savimbi said that before returning to angola he will stop off 
at other african countries not identified for talks with leaders 
sympathetic to his movement

spill 
under relentless prodding from superior court judge karl 
johnstone attorneys questioned 10 jurors tuesday from a pool of 91 
drawn for the trial of joseph hazelwood four were excused from the 
case 
two of those dismissed had expressed concerns about financial 
problems if the trial were to last two months or longer the others

examinations 
its going much faster than i expected said defense lawyer

the estimated 50000 soviet troops in hungary and about 70000 
in czechoslovakia are stationed on the basis of temporary 
agreements the kremlin reached with the two countries after 
quashing revolts against stalinism in 1956 in hungary and in 1968 
in czechoslovakia 
while moscow has signaled willingness to discuss the demands 
from prague and budapest for withdrawal it is not clear whether 
the soviets want the pullouts coordinated with cutbacks due for 
agreement this year at the vienna talks on reducing conventional 
forces in europe 
mti said thursdays talks will be attended by senior military 
figures on each side 
hungarian premier miklos nemeth announced last week the 
negotations would begin after he had consulted with soviet premier 
nikolai i ryzhkov on the subject 
nemeth said he and the soviet agreed that the hitherto basis 
for the stationing of troops on hungarian soil has outlived itself 
there are neither military nor political reasons for their 
presence 
nemeth said hungarys strategic and geographic position unlike 
czechoslovakia it does not border a nato country and its policy 
meant the soviet troops could withdraw at the earliest possible 
time

president mikhail s gorbachev met tuesday with 
east german premier hans modrow and appeared to be more open toward 
eventual german reunification 
modrow told reporters after the meeting that gorbachev did not 
rule out such a prospect in the future and at the same time did 
not venture to set some time limits for that 
earlier the kremlin chief said any such decisions must include 
the four allied powers and take into account european opinions 
the development of events in the world in east germany in 
the soviet union demand deep consideration and an analytical 
approach to deciding this problem he said in remarks reported by 
the official news agency tass 
time itself is acting on this process giving it dynamism 
gorbachev said we have to act responsibly and not decide this 
important question on the streets 
tass said gorbachev emphasized that talks about restructuring 
relations between the two germanys must involve all directly 
interested governments 
asked by an east german correspondent about his attitude toward 
reunification gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and 
that no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it 
however the englishlanguage tass translation indicated 
gorbachev could have meant there were no doubts about reunification 
itself 
gorbachevs position was similar to that adopted by communists 
in east berlin on tuesday for the first time the communists 
acknowledged german unity as a longterm goal but said it must be 
imbedded in the process of overcoming europes overall divisions 
the soviet union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk of 
german reunification but gorbachev has softened that position in 
adopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in eastern europe 
soviets say the question of german reunification is to be 
decided in the future 
gorbachev in comments to reporters after meeting french 
president francois mitterrand in kiev in december reiterated his 
view that the existence of two german states is a fact based on the 
outcome of world war ii 
but he added the present situation is the result of specific 
historical events a specific historical process on this continent 
so history should decide the future of this continent 
i dont think it is a topical question today a different 
approach may create a situation that would complicate the entire 
european process including the relations between the two german 
states gorbachev said 
modrow said the two germanys could work toward confederation in 
phases with no time limit 
he said he agreed with gorbachev that reunification must be 
decided not only by east and west germany but all of europe 
according to tass the soviet leader said any action on 
reunification must not infringe on the interests of either east or 
west germany the four allied powers france britain the united 
states or the soviet union or anyone else in europe 
count otto lambsdorff head of west germanys free democratic 
party a partner in the governing coalition said tuesday in london 
that gorbachev has adopted a more positive attitude toward 
german reunification 
in a tv interview on britains channel 4 he also urged 
economic union within 18 months as a prelude to full union of 
west and east germany 
lambsdorff said that because of east germanys political 
instability it had only two choices unification or chaos 
modrow invited gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzhkov to visit 
east germany and they accepted tass reported 
modrow arrived in moscow late monday a communist he has moved 
forward the countrys first free elections from may to march 18 and 
brought the opposition into a coalition that will govern until then

doctors at a london hospital said tuesday night 
they had conducted what they believe are the worlds first 
successful heart operations on a baby still in the womb 
lindsey allan the doctor in charge of the fetal cardiology unit 
at guys hospital said the team there had corrected a heart valve 
defect in an unborn boy using a balloon catheter guided into place 
by ultrasonic sound 
as far as i know this is the first successful operation of its 
kind she said 
she said two operations were carried out on the fetus during the 
mothers pregnancy one at 31 weeks and the second at 33 weeks 
ms allan said the baby was born prematurely on jan 4 one 
week after the second operation and underwent surgery for the 
third time a few hours after birth 
she did not say why there had been a delay in disclosing details 
of the operations 
the child is still quite seriously ill but we have given him 
a chance he would not otherwise have had ms allan said 
she said the parents who did not want to be identified lived 
outside london 
the operations involved inserting a catheter down a hollow 
needle directly into the chest wall and heart of the fetus once in 
place the balloon was dilated to open the heart valve 
a catheter is a slender tube inserted into a body passage 
vessel or cavity its normal uses include passing fluids and making 
examinations 
ms allan said the team that pioneered the technique included 
herself michael tynan professor of pediatric cardiology and 
darryl maxwell director of the hospitals fetal medicine unit 
she said there were always ethical obstacles to this type of 
operation 
i am not sure that we should be meddling sometimes there is 
always discussion as to whether it is a reasonable request to make 
of the mother on the other hand one knows that the alternative is 
almost universally fatal she said

cutter and two people may have drowned in the confusion 
authorities said tuesday 
the cutter thetis arrived in portauprince tuesday with the 
remaining 48 people aboard and the coast guard has launched an 
investigation into the incident said lt cmdr jeff karonis

throwing the haitians the coast guard boarding party and the ins 
agent into the water a coast guard release said 
four haitians were injured one was cut and three nearly 
drowned and passengers reported two others were missing

karonis said at the time of the accident winds were 10 knots with 
seas of 5 to 7 feet

sunday times editor andrew neil won a libel case 
tuesday against a rival who questioned his taste in women ending a 
trial that took the public into the world of fleet streets private 
passions 
neil sued the sunday telegraph and its former editor peregrine 
worsthorne over an editorial worsthorne wrote last march saying 
neils affair with a call girl rendered him unfit to edit a quality 
newspaper a second article and a cartoon were also cited by neil 
its a clear vindication im delighted said neil its 
been a tough battle im happy with the award 
worsthorne who had argued that his article was fair comment 
claimed the damages were so derisory that it was as good as a 
victory 
a high court jury awarded neil about 1600 in damages while 
his employer times newspapers walked away with just 1 the 
price of the paper 
the awards were minimal compared with the six and even 
sevenfigure sums handed out to libel victims lately 
the biggest money winners were the lawyers the defendants were 
ordered to pay an estimated 320000 in court costs 
worsthorne said it was a case that should never have been 
brought and mr neil should be ashamed of himself let this case 
teach all editors a lesson dont sue 
worsthornes editorial titled playboys as editors claimed 
neils fourmonth affair with call girl pamella bordes had brought 
the sunday times into disrepute 
neil a 40yearold bachelor sued saying it was the most 
damaging attack on my professional integrity in his six years as 
sunday times editor 
he insisted that contrary to what worsthorne wrote he did not 
know ms bordes 27 was a call girl until after their affair ended 
ms bordes was not in court 
she became news when tabloid newspapers reported she had worked 
at the house of commons as a researcher and had been escorted the 
previous year by neil and another sunday newspaper editor donald 
trelford of the observer 
trelford took no action 
neils award sniped worsthorne on independent television news 
wouldnt even pay for a weekend with ms bordes 
neil countered that the outcome of the libel case was a 
victory for the new britain against the old britain a swipe at 
the crusty conservative style of the telegraph and 66yearold 
worsthorne 
the damages suggested that the jury agreed with judge michael 
davies who said in summing up that the case might be much ado 
about nothing 
davies said the case reminded him of two great steam locomotives 
crashing head on

voters picking a successor to a city 
councilman killed in a rash of mail bombings narrowed the field 
from eight candidates to two on tuesday 
educator clifford hardwick iii and dentist phyllis mack led the 
pack in complete but unofficial returns and are to meet in a feb 
20 runoff for robert robinsons council seat 
robinson a black attorney who worked on civil rights cases was 
killed when he opened a package bomb at his law office dec 18 a 
letter claiming responsibility threatened more attacks on black 
leaders 
hardwick received 920 of the 2572 votes cast mack had 494 and 
mary evans roberts had 444 the others received votes of 210 or 
less including the candidate endorsed by robinsons widow horace 
hall who got 201 
elections supervisor patty mckenna said the 29 percent turnout 
was about normal for an election in the district despite the high 
emotion provoked by the robinson slaying 
the rev henry r delaney said some black people in savannah are 
apprehensive about packages a secretary at the savannah office 
of the national association for the advancement of colored people 
told a reporter she could no longer release the names of naacp 
officers 
in light of whats been happening to our people im not at 
liberty to give out the names of any people affiliated with our 
organization said the secretary she declined to give her name 
in mountain brook ala there has been little discussion of 
fear for personal safety although federal marshals still keep 
watch in the driveway of us circuit judge robert vances home 
where he was killed by an exploding package two days before 
robinsons slaying 
the judges neighbors talk more about their desire to see the 
killer caught and whether the fbis dragnet for evidence in 
southeastern alabama will yield fruit vances wife helen was 
injured in the blast but said she has recovered 
there is a lot of dismay over all the latest publicity which 
doesnt seem to be coming to any conclusion unless theres an 
indictment said the rev john claypool rector of st lukes 
episcopal church where vances ashes are interred 
the fbi has searched the property of enterprise ala junk 
dealer robert wayne oferrell who denies wrongdoing and has not 
been charged oferrell says the fbi thinks he once owned a 
typewriter used in a letter claiming responsibility 
charles ashby the neighbor to whom mrs vance rushed after the 
explosion last month said life is returning to normal in the 
exclusive shook hill neighborhood where estatesized lots are 
sprinkled with tall pine trees 
robinsons city council district in savannah is 75 percent 
black largely poor an area where many turnofthecentury homes 
have not shared in the coastal citys zealous historic preservation 
there the bombings have been followed by other racial threats 
delaney pastor of st pauls christian methodist church and a 
speaker at robinsons funeral recently received a hate letter 
after he appeared on a television program a black state 
representative roy allen also got a threatening letter 
but several people interviewed on the streets of robinsons 
district said they dont believe average black savannah residents 
feel more threatened now 
i dont think its created any excess fear said city water 
department employee pearlie frazier its just added to the 
frustration that the average black person feels on a daily basis 
in both cities friends of the victims are looking for positive 
memories 
reuben davis a jefferson county commissioner wants to 
establish a memorial to vance who pushed for racial equality while 
chairman of the alabama democratic party he envisions a symbol 
of a man that worked in his community for peace and harmony and yet 
died such a violent death 
in savannah state sen al scott said robinsons death perhaps 
will draw attention to the senselessness of hate crimes and 
bigotry

a federal judge on tuesday blocked a critical 
book about scientology founder l ron hubbard finding that it 
violated the copyrights of his authorized biographer 
us district judge louis l stanton said the book which is 
still in manuscript form could be published after infringing 
passages were deleted 
melvin wulf lawyer for the books publisher said the decision 
was a dagger in the heart of the first amendment and would not 
hold up on appeal 
it would be a terrible incursion into our free speech 
rights wulf said 
the ruling stemmed from a lawsuit by new era publications 
international which has certain exclusive copyrights to hubbards 
private papers for the purpose of writing his authorized biography 
the company also is the publisher of scientology books 
hubbard who died in 1986 founded the church of scientology and 
wrote dozens of books about the religion and his philosophy he 
taught that spiritual competence is achieved by erasing mental 
images in the unconscious mind that cause irrational behavior 
the disputed book a piece of blue sky is written by former 
scientologist jonathan cavenatack who became disillusioned with 
hubbards teachings after following them for nine years 
according to stantons decision atack came to believe that 
scientology is a dangerous cult and that mr hubbard far from 
being the gentle prophet portrayed in church literature was a 
paranoid vindictive and profoundly disturbed man 
after receiving permission from stanton last summer to review 
the manuscript new era said 121 passages slightly less than 3 
percent of the book were taken from copyrighted sources 
the books publisher carol publishing group claimed the 
passages were allowed by a section of copyright law called fair 
use which says copyrighted works can be used for criticism 
comment news reporting teaching or research 
stanton however found that much of the copyrighted material in 
atacks book was used by itself at the beginning of a chapter 
the evident purpose of this device which is carried out with 
some effect is to use passages from mr hubbards work to set the 
tone for the sections they precede he said in essence these 
passages use copyrighted materials as a literary device rather than 
a basis for a critical study of mr hubbard 
the judge said carol publishing could easily delete the 
infringing passages the only apparent hardships resulting from 
an injunction are some delay in publication and a more stringent 
editing process 
wulf said stanton had shown a total misunderstanding of the 
fairuse law it really threatens to impair the right of 
biographers and scholars to study the works of other people who are 
of great public interest he said 
new eras lawyer jonathan rubell said his client had never 
intended to stop the books publication it was the use of 
expression rather than factual presentation that we were 
complaining about he said

the us justice department is going to ask a 
federal court next week to take over the longshoremens union 
because of accusations the union is controlled by organized crime 
according to a television report tuesday 
the justice department is going to argue that a trustee should 
be named to oversee the international longshoremens association 
because of its alleged criminal affiliation abc news reported the 
report did not cite sources 
a bush administration official confirmed only that action 
against segments of the union and not the entire association is 
planned 
us attorney andrew maloney of the eastern district confirmed 
that the southern district was looking into the union but 
attorneys there had no comment 
a spokesman for the union jim mcnamara said the international 
had not been informed there was an investigation and he was not 
aware of the action 
the government has sought trusteeships in other cases where mob 
influence was alleged four teamsters locals for instance are 
operating under court trusteeships 
last march the us attorneys office in the southern district 
dropped part of a racketeering lawsuit against teamsters leadership 
in return the union agreed to election rule changes and the 
appointment of three monitors with broad powers to oversee union 
elections and management 
the three monitors were appointed by us district judge david

radio comedy scripts written by the late groucho 
marx and his brother chico that were unearthed by a researcher in 
the us library of congress were performed for the first time in 
58 years in a london broadcast 
a live audience at a british broadcasting corp studio broke 
into rapturous applause at the end of tuesday nights performance 
in which british actors playing the roles of the two american 
comedians read the scripts of the flywheel shyster and 
flywheel show 
bbc producer dirk maggs said the scripts had not been heard 
since being broadcast in the united states in 1932 
he said the scripts were discovered about a year ago in the 
library of congress in washington by researcher mike barson and 
that the bbc had successfully bid for exclusive rights to them 
he did not explain the legal intricacies of the deal and did not 
say how much the bbc paid 
the scripts for flywheel shyster and flywheel were part of 
a series groucho and chico marx made for standard oil but which 
were never recorded maggs said 
he said the scripts were subsequently filed away and were 
thought to have been lost until barson discovered them and realized 
their importance 
fans of the marx brothers stood in line in the rain outside the 
studio before the show to make sure of getting a seat 
the bbc filmed the show and will broadcast it later this year 
maggs said 
groucho was played by mike roberts complete with mustache and 
big cigar grouchos trademarks frank lazarus played chico 
maggs said the great thing about the scripts is that many of 
the incredible sketches and gags which they later did in their 
movies are here in an earlier form and you can see how they 
developed their ideas 
they have never been heard since they were first produced and 
finding the scripts was like finding tutankhamens tomb 
in the scripts the groucho character flywheel is an 
unscrupulous lawyer and chico is his even more unscrupulous 
assistant ravelli

the cover of the new bradford telephone directory 
is a hit with art lovers but many locals are less than 
enthusiastic about artist david hockneys colorful childlike 
painting of the city where he was born 
some bradfordians prefer the previous editions picturepostcard 
views of the cathedral castle and surrounding moors and they have 
been venting their irritation in letters to the press 
the letters are all of the same ilk my grandchild could do 
a similar job said malcolm hoddy editor of the west yorkshire 
telegraph and argus 
for instance vera g taylor wrote what an insult to print 
this outrageous piece of socalled art on our telephone directory 
who do they think they are kidding not me i have seen better 
drawings in our local first schools 
hoddy admits he would not recognize his hometown from hockneys 
painting but he has little time for the critics 
whenever hockney paints anything that makes any kind of news 
you get the same people writing in hoddy said theyre the 
same ones who are wondering why picasso put an eye under an armpit 
but what a lot of people tend to forget is that hockney did 
this for no charge its not costing anybody anything and theyre 
getting a phone book with a hockney picture on it under the door 
for free hoddy said 
hockneys supporters point out that the painter not only is a 
living rebuttal of yorkshires reputation for lowbrow dourness 
but he has stayed in touch with bradford despite having lived in 
los angeles for 25 years 
the 51yearold artist has participated in other civic projects 
designing the cover for a handbook for the disabled and a 
bradfords bouncing back poster for a campaign to invigorate 
the industrial city of 460000 people 
the phone company british telecom printed 295000 copies of 
the book to meet the needs of bradford and surrounding places like 
blubberhouses hortoninribblesdale and haworth the hometown of 
the bronte sisters 
but british telecom anticipated outside interest and printed an 
extra 5000 copies said spokeswoman anne crawther 
weve received requests from people in dallas seattle geneva 
and germany she said 
she said 50 copies were being sent to hockney and a london 
collector has bought 500 volumes at 6 each hockney has retained 
the original painting and rights to its use ms crawther said 
hockney originals now fetch more than 1 million but art expert 
john kasmin doubted the phone book would appreciate in value 
if people are buying the phone book because they think it will 
be worth something i should think they are misguided kasmin

installations has riled officials in large cities and small towns 
targeted communities nationwide are mobilizing to fight like the 
dickens to avoid the cuts 
california would be the hardest hit under defense secretary dick 
cheneys proposal with 10 bases employing more than 35000 
servicemen and 22000 civilian workers slated for closure or 
reductions 
but the closings also would hit hard in communities such as 
charlestown ind a southern indiana town of 5700 where the 
defense department plans to mothball a munitions plant and lay off 
about 900 workers 
in announcing his 2921 billion fiscal 1991 spending plan 
monday cheney called for congress to have the guts to make 
tough decisions about closing military bases

researchers unveiled a prototype computer 
that uses light instead of electrical impulses to process data and 
said it could be as revolutionary as the transistor that ushered in 
the computer age 
the computer processor that bell laboratories displayed monday 
was crude with enough power only to operate something like a 
dishwasher within a decade however it could lead to development 
of lightbased supercomputers operating at least 100 times faster 
than current machines said alan huang head of bell labs optical 
computer research department 
this stage says it can be done said bob trier technical 
program director for research consortium inc of minneapolis which 
studies highperformance computing the next stage is to find out 
what can be done with this technology 
for years researchers have been looking at photons the 
fundamental particles of light as replacements for electrons in 
electronic equipment such a shift promises computers vastly more 
agile and powerful than todays machines

in proposing an inducement to saving president 
bush is seeking to uproot what has become an american tradition 
one of living for the moment of living in debt of borrowing from 
the future 
it is a pervasive habit one so common you might say 
everyone does it uncle sam corporations households and 
students who used to work their way through college lender or 
borrower theyre all hooked on debt 
insidiously debt to support further spending tends to entrap 
forcing the user to borrow again and again interest costs for 
example are one of the reasons uncle sam runs a budget deficit he 
has to borrow to pay them 
once people try debt they seem to like it and theyll go to any 
extreme to justify it 
corporations issue junk bonds that endanger their futures uncle 
sam seeks budget balance by shoving items off the budget sheets 
thats still not enough for many households they commit what 
used to be thought of as a mortal sin mortgaging the roof over 
their heads by taking out an equity loan many go further 
borrowing on their insurance policies 
theres a peddlar a pusher on every corner 
banks that should know better offer cards and credit lines to 
strangers wall street packages debt and sells it as securities 
the media glamorize extravagance publishers push books on 
borrowing your way to wealth 
and now president bush wants individual americans to just say 
no his proposal is this a new family savings plan that would 
allow interest to accumulate free of income taxes 
under the proposal couples could set aside 5000 and 
individuals 2500 a year and avoid any income tax on interest 
earned if the money remained in the account for at least seven 
years 
can the proposal encourage people to save maybe much depends 
on economic conditions 
a high or rising inflation rate could endanger it first by 
encouraging spending in advance of higher prices secondly by 
undermining real returns high inflation also could force 
households to cash out for living expenses 
it also would require faith by savers history shows that to 
some extent tax laws are changed every year tax benefits of iras 
or individual retirement accounts for example were reduced after 
a few years 
of course if people already are living to the full extent of 
their incomes and beyond they might not have money to put away 
can it really change the general attitude toward borrowing and 
saving 
it could be a start if combined with other proposals such as 
the presidents idea of lowering capital gains taxes for 
investments held three years or longer but the habit of borrowing 
rather than saving is imbedded 
bush certainly can make a beginning similarly impossible 
feats have been performed a decade ago for instance some of the 
best minds in finance said singledigit home mortgages rates never 
would be seen again how wrong 
in seeking change bush has some things going for him 
even stronger than the urge to save or spend might be the urge 
to avoid taxes a decade ago all consumer interest was tax 
deductible a gradual phasing out brings the deductible this year 
to just 10 percent of the total 
thus one of the main inducements to borrowing has been or will 
be removed 
america is older one reason for high borrowing and low savings 
was the populations age there was a bulge of people age 20 years 
to 35 years the bigspending years that bulge is moving up in 
age its big spending behind it 
the pressure is growing on uncle sam to reduce his own spending 
ways there has been some success and maybe more to come if so 
uncle sam might be the perfect role model

stiltsville is on its last legs the cluster of 
rustic vacation homes rising out of floridas biscayne bay will 
have to come down by the turn of the century by decree of the 
government for people like thatcher edmunds it will be a paradise 
lost 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
thatcher edmunds recalls 
back in the early 1960s when the stilt structures dotting the flats 
of biscayne bay were notorious hangouts for gamblers boozers and 
flashy women 
characters such as plucky pierre and his righthand man 
shipwreck kelly ran a joint called the bikini club where a pink 
card gained entry for members any time of day or night 
seamen found their way to the quarterdeck club which was fully 
equipped with a bar table games and for a time slot machines 
ours though was strictly for family says edmunds who 
calls his dwelling on stilts the a house 
sonamed because of its distinctive aframe architecture the 
faded yellow retreat sits in several feet of water along with 13 
other such vacation homes and weekend retreats off the southern 
coast of key biscayne 
pleasure boaters cruising biscayne bay can hardly miss the stilt 
homes that have become a veritable miami landmark 
curious miamians and visitors alike pass through stiltsvilles 
natural deepwater channels en route to the ocean and sometimes 
leave slashes in the sea grasses after dragging their engines on 
the bay bottom in the clear shallow water around the homes 
but even with its reputation considerably mellowed and more 
family oriented stiltsville will no longer exist at the turn of 
the century 
residents leases for quarteracre underwater sites wont be 
renewed after july 1 1999 by decree of the florida cabinet the 
state allowed the bay bottom to be leased through the next decade 
but prohibited new construction after the legislature passed the 
biscayne bay aquatic preserve act in 1974 
we are taking this area which is close to a large urban area 
and returning it to its natural state says lisa garvin 
spokeswoman for the 173000acre biscayne national park 
although some people have called stiltsville an eyesore and 
environmental concerns have been raised edmunds and others say the 
homes should be saved 
maybe theyre jealous because they cant build edmunds 
says we were there long before it was a national park were not 
bothering anyone 
edmunds 61 a retired trucking company supervisor from pembroke 
pines shares the retreat with three other families the 40by 
50foot threebedroom house about six miles offshore from miami 
and a mile from the cape florida lighthouse has stood for 27 
years hurricane donna leveled the original structure 
residents now can rebuild homes damaged during storms only if at 
least 51 percent of the structure remains intact 
it took about a year for the families to build the aframe house 
themselves towing scrap lumber and materials to the site in small 
outboards 
it was almost like homesteading edmunds says 
in 1965 he says ivan tors studios featured the house as the 
base of operations for an underwater coal mining company in the 
movie round the world under the sea church groups and boy 
scouts also have borrowed the place for special retreats 
dont expect any luxuries here edmunds says though its the 
best getaway possible still within sight of the miami skyline 
you never run out of things to do relax fish waterski 
dive or watch the boats go by he says 
there is no television no telephone they catch rainwater for 
showers and washing dishes generators provide electricity and the 
breeze off the bay provides the worlds best air conditioning 
edmunds says as he throws open the wooden doors off the combination 
sitting roomkitchendining area 
the bay its water patches of light green and indigo blue used 
to offer some of the best bonefishing anywhere before miamis 
population boomed edmunds says but despite the decline in marine 
life its still easy to catch a panful of fish for supper 
you can cast off the porch any time you want and catch all the 
fish you want edmunds says 
old pictures from family outings cram a large bulletin board 
inside the wooden house many of them showing bloody sharks bigger 
than the young boys who caught them 
over the course of about 60 years residents of stiltsville have 
often helped boaters who became stranded or got caught in a bad 
storm 
through the years i cant imagine how many ive pulled off the 
flats or helped them repair their boats or towed them in edmunds 
says 
residents pay the state department of natural resources 1000 
annually to lease the site when the first structures began shaping 
stiltsville the bay bottom was leased for 1 an acre the 
community peaked after world war ii with some 20 residences 
today some of the structures have fallen into disrepair after 
years of constant exposure to wind and salt spray 
edmunds says its a constant battle to keep up his retreat 
replacing beams painting and making repairs he worries about 
stiltsvilles possible deterioration in the next decade because 
owners may decide its not worth spending the money for repairs if 
theyll have to move or tear down the residences 
if the state remains committed to eliminating stiltsville 
edmunds says itll do more than just take away a slice of paradise 
for owners in the area 
itll take away a lot of pleasure for people who visit he 
says its just the neatest place in the world

a prosecutor investigating the deaths of eight 
followers of a housewifeturnedguru over the last 12 years is 
trying to piece together a criminal case with a hardtoprove 
premise that beliefs can kill 
four followers of mystical leader terri hoffman have committed 
suicide including two of her four husbands and two died in 
apparent accidents of those six two told relatives they suffered 
from terminal illnesses although autopsies showed they did not 
and at least four bequeathed money and property to ms hoffman 
then in november police linked the deaths of an investment 
counselor and his wife to ms hoffmans pastiche of philosophy 
ancient mythology and metaphysics 
david and glenda goodman were found shot to death in their den 
two handguns beside them on the floor on a desk a few feet away 
lay two purple spiralbound notebooks in which they recorded their 
devotion to ms hoffman 
in one book mrs goodman called the shooting the path to 
success and an escape from the sufferings of the physical world 
soon she wrote to her husband he would be able to come and go 
from the physical world at will just as she said terri can 
the journals tell more how the goodmans both 48 were 
considering leaving their home to ms hoffman their check 
registers indicated theyd already given her 110000 over three 
years police say 
in addition to the deaths of the eight devotees a ninth person 
a housekeeper died when the car of one follower plunged off a 
colorado cliff 
assistant district attorney cecil emerson said hes trying to 
determine whether mind control can be legally blamed for 
contributing to a death which might require breaking new legal 
ground 
its never entered anyones mind that you could put together a 
case like this emerson said im confident we can 
still he conceded it would be a long time before he could put 
the case before a grand jury if it even gets that far 
the theme of this investigation is murder he said the 
reality is probably theft 
so far investigators have gathered mostly autopsy reports the 
files of police investigations into the accidents and the financial 
records of some of those who died 
no criminal action has been taken against ms hoffman but two 
lawsuits have been filed against her 
in 1982 the brother of follower sandra cleaver contested her 
will leaving everything to ms hoffman including a 300000 life 
insurance policy and a house six days after the case went to 
trial ms hoffman and ms cleavers brother agreed out of court to 
split the estate 
she faces a civil trial in march stemming from a wrongful death 
suit brought by the children of her fourth husband don hoffman 
who killed himself in september 1988 
ms hoffmans attorney fred time said she is being persecuted 
its witch hunting time said shes supposed to have all 
these tremendous powers ridiculous theres no history of that 
anywhere in the world 
he said the suit and investigation would clear ms hoffman 51 
who he described as a plain ordinary person who gets money by 
counseling people 
how does he explain the number of deaths among her followers 
she listens to people who are in extremely transient stages of 
their life time said 
ms hoffman told the associated press she would answer questions 
only in the presence of time who said he would not allow her to 
speak to reporters while an investigation was pending 
ms hoffman became known in dallas in the late 1960s and early 
70s for her meditation classes a blend of mythology and 
metaphysics in which masters were said to be reached 
a master is a high evolved being who has great wisdom she 
told the monthly aspectarian last year she described for the 
chicagobased magazine her first experience with masters which 
took place at age 3 saying they explained to me that they were 
beings that sometimes helped people that are in physical bodies or 
other bodies and they come to teach them 
in 1974 ms hoffman founded conscious development of body mind 
amp soul inc to sell tapes and booklets of her teachings she sold 
thousands time said and attracted hundreds of followers 
david goodman became one of them in the early 70s he met ms 
hoffman at dallas southern methodist university where he was a 
business professor and she was teaching a meditation class emerson 
said 
ms hoffman counseled goodman during his first divorce they 
became friends and years later made business investments together 
when ms hoffman was sued by ms cleavers brother goodman 
testified on her behalf and when he left smu in 1987 she helped 
him start an investment newsletter 
goodman married and divorced twice more before he met his fourth 
wife glenda also a devotee they continued to adhere to ms 
hoffmans teachings years after most followers abandoned them 
ms hoffmans classes began to dissipate in 1977 after the 
suicide of her second husband glenn cooley some followers have 
said they became wary as ms hoffmans meditations and spiritual 
sessions focused less on learning than on fighting evil forces 
cooley killed himself less than a week after the couples 
divorce became final the first of the nine deaths police now are 
investigating 
in 1979 devereaux cleaver the 14yearold daughter of sandra 
cleaver drowned rafting in hawaii two years later ms cleaver 
and her housekeeper who did not follow ms hoffmans teachings 
died in a car that tumbled off a colorado cliff near land owned by 
some devotees 
in 1987 another follower robin otstott shot herself after 
telling people she had viral hepatitis like don hoffman who said 
he had cancer when he took a drug overdose an autopsy showed ms 
otstott did not have the disease she claimed 
a chicago follower of ms hoffman mary levinson also killed 
herself in 1987 just weeks before she changed her will to dispose 
of her estate valued at more than 125000 in a manner that could 
not be traced her parents told the dallas morning news ms 
hoffman told the newspaper she did not receive any money from ms 
levinson but would not answer other questions 
ms hoffman was a beneficiary in both her husbands wills as 
well as in ms cleavers and ms otstotts time confirmed 
police have not found a will for the goodmans but their 
journals indicate they considered deeding their house to ms 
hoffman 
those writings also suggest they were concerned about tax 
problems goodman lost money in a dallas investment company whose 
leaders were convicted of tax fraud last year emerson said though 
goodman was not implicated in any criminal activity he lost 
thousands of dollars in the companys illegal shelters in 1988 he 
reached an agreement with the internal revenue service to retire a 
tax debt estimated at more than 300000 the morning news 
reported the irs declined to release details of the case 
goodmans father said the couple broke off contact with 
relatives and many friends in 1989 
we had a fine loving relationship up until then said 
leonard goodman 74 of santa maria calif something very 
unusual it turned out very tragic happened to break that 
relationship

he said he would not elaborate while the deaths were under 
investigation 
the goodmans two purple notebooks contain some of the strongest 
evidence investigators have linking them to ms hoffman 
on page after page david goodman calling himself jupiter after 
the roman god asks questions of glenda addressed as venus about 
their quest to leave the physical 
in one passage mrs goodman apparently writing as a god 
speaking to both her mortal self and her husband said just like 
with the shooting if you do that i can make you both a success 
that is can make you yourself your spirit 
in another passage goodman asks about suffering and his wife 
responds with an apparent reference to ms hoffman 
terri in the physical has also suffered her advantage is 
that she is able to leave the physical although not at any moment 
she chooses in time you both as well as terri will be able to come 
and go freely at will 
she is anxious for that day as you are

returning to his badguy beginnings richard 
gere is back in the movie fast lane after a lapse that had 
hollywood wondering if he was more interested in causes than an 
acting career 
gere crashed onto the movie scene in 1977 as one of diane 
keatons sleazy boyfriends in looking for mr goodbar it was a 
small part and helped get him the lead as the male prostitute in 
the seamy american gigolo in 1980 
he soon became a top leading man most notably in the 1982 hit 
an officer and a gentleman a few bombs followed then a long 
absence from the screen he seemed to be devoting all his energies 
to alerting the public to the longtime chinese repression in tibet 
now gere has returned to the movie bigtime in paramount 
pictures internal affairs starring as a crooked cop the film 
received mixed reviews from critics but has found favor with 
audiences earning 11 million in two weeks 
gere next appears in a romantic comedy with julia roberts 
pretty woman for touchstone pictures 
internal affairs casts gere as dennis peck a veteran los 
angeles street cop who has become an expert in extortion and 
murderforhire andy garcia is the detective who investigates him 
peck is a thorough sleaze and misogynist but gere doesnt see him 
that way 
he doesnt think hes bad you know this was a very tough 
script it was a very disturbing read as well as to see it i had 
to really look into it to see what was so disturbing and what was 
worthwhile about the film gere said 
i realized that it was similar to iago and othello it was 
that kind of evil the evil of iago in pecks case it was the same 
as othello it was jealousy that he pinpoints 
the more i looked into him the more i saw of this incredible 
megalomaniac control not the small kind that we have in most of 
our lives but an extraordinary kind of octopus of arms and 
tentacles going out in all directions he had five wives and ten 
kids and he controlled these families as well as the police 
department but on the other hand he did not need to be more than 
a foot soldier 
gere plays his own age 40 graying hair and all he sounds like 
an oldtimer when he comments about costar garcia i saw in him 
hes in his early 30s a lot of myself when i was his age i had 
the same level of intensity that hes coming from 
he added with a grin i keep telling them i can play 18 but 
they dont believe me age doesnt bother me either way there 
are a couple of films im developing that would be aging movies 
from the late 20s into the 50s certainly playing the younger of 
those characters i would dye my hair 
throughout his career gere has never been comfortable with 
interviews but he seemed more at ease when he was recently here to 
promote internal affairs except for the littleseen miles 
from home he has been absent from the big screen for three 
years during much of that time he devoted himself to the cause of 
his longtime friend the dalai lama the actor helped establish 
tibet house new york aimed at preserving the countrys heritage 
two events last year helped bring tibets plight to the worlds 
attention he said citing the massacre during prodemocracy 
protests by chinese students in tiananmen square and the awarding 
of the nobel peace prize to the dalai lama gere attended the 
presentation ceremonies in oslo norway 
he said tiananmen square was perhaps 10 percent of what the 
chinese have been doing every day in tibet for 35 years 
gere was born in philadelphia and grew up on a farm near 
syracuse ny he remembers his debut as an actor my first role 
was santa claus in the second grade my mother made the costume 
herself which she still reminds me of in high school i played the 
president of the united states and the entire audience of my peers 
started howling that dick gere was playing the president 
at 19 i left college university of massachusetts thinking i 
had done nothing with my life thats when i went into repertory 
after work at the provincetown playhouse and the seattle 
repertory theater he played offbroadway roles and danny zuko in 
the new york and london companies of grease his film debut 
came in terence malicks days of heaven he also costarred in 
the broadway production of bent after american gigolo 
a series of mishaps breathless beyond the limits

the bush administration proposed increasing 
fees on securities and futures transactions to help fund higher 
spending by the federal agencies that regulate both industries 
the governments fiscal year 1991 budget released monday calls 
for a 47 million funding increase for the securities and exchange 
commission the independent agency that regulates the nations 
stock and bond markets 
the budget also seeks an 11centpertransaction fee on futures 
trades to cover the expenses of the commodity futures trading 
commission which oversees the nations futures markets 
spokesmen for both the securities industry association and the 
futures industry association were not in their office when called 
for comment late monday 
the 123 trillion budget proposal seeks to increase the secs 
annual funding to 1866 million an increase of 34 percent or 47 
million over outlays for 1990 spending for the cftc would increase 
by about 77 million or 21 percent to 445 million 
the budget plan for the sec noted that a temporary increase in 
securities registration fees beginning july 1 is expected to raise 
nearly 229 million which is to be counted as offsetting 
receipts that is the amount would go toward funding the secs 
1395 million outlay for fiscal year 1990 
all securities offered for sale to the public must be registered 
with the sec whose main mission is to protect the investing 
public the sec is not selffunding although it collects nearly 
twice as much in fees than it is allocated in the budget 
in addition to calling for making the registration fee increase 
permanent the bush administration plans to seek legislation to 
raise fees charged for all transactions on a securities exchange 
for all mergers and proxy votes and to extend the fee increase to 
securities traded over the counter that qualify for trading in a 
national market system 
the budget proposal projected that those fee increases if 
approved by congress would generate 801 million for the 
government in fiscal year 1991 
the plans 11cent futures transaction fee beginning oct 1 
would cover additional expenses for the cftc those expenses would 
include stepped up market surveillance and investigations called 
for by congress in the wake of indictments at the nations 
twolargest futures exchanges in chicago last summer

a caribbean island retreat for 
chemically dependant professionals aims to let wellheeled clients 
kick the habit in style and in anonymity 
we take it further than just explaining the disease and saying 
abstain we teach people to enjoy life said karen ann crissy 
president of the ft lauderdalebased caribbean retreat inc 
its more like a club med with a therapeutic focus 
the 20acre island is fully booked for the first 21day session 
of therapy sports and recreation which starts next month she 
said 
the cost of treatment which includes transportation to the 
island by private air charter is 15000 the retreats program 
will focus on stress management and is based on therapies offered 
by alcoholics anonymous crissy said 
crissy and two other investors bought the tropical island for 
about 1 million from a new york syndication of companies that used 
it for corporate vacations 
clients must be drug or alcoholfree for 30 days and in good 
health before being accepted for treatment she said 
both clients and staff must sign an agreement to keep the 
islands name and locale confidential 
to further protect clients confidentiality crissy said the 
program will not do any thirdparty billing so it will not be 
recorded on medical records or be covered by insurance 
we stress anonymity seclusion and privacy she said we 
want to protect the people who are going there 
caribbean retreat features a program of individual and group 
therapy that promotes healing through a mix of metaphysics 
meditation philosophy and physical activity crissy said she has 
hired psychologists sports coaches and hypnotists to work with her 
clients 
she is marketing her recovery center to the directors of 
corporate employee assistance programs since those programs are 
confidential they can pass the information along to employees in 
need 
one such program director said he is not sure if its a good 
idea to send someone with a drug or alcohol problem to an island 
retreat 
paul heck director of the employee assistance program at jc 
penney co near dallas said the geographic isolation could make 
some families feel left out of the recovery process and addicts 
could see the retreat trip as a chance to escape problems at home 
this is a guy who lives for the job comes home and is an 
absent husband said heck now he is off on a caribbean island 
and were supposed to be happy 
nevertheless the retreats seclusion could be attractive to 
some heck said 
for many people it would be worth the money to keep it 
confidential

bank of new england corp which has suffered 
heavy real estate losses and watched depositors withdraw millions 
of dollars says it will raise 828 million by selling its credit 
card business to citicorp 
we are very pleased to announce the completion of this 
important step in our asset sales strategy h ridgely bullock 
the banks interim chairman said in a statement monday we are 
right on track with our strategic plan 
bullock was named interim chairman last week after the board 
forced out the previous chairman walter connolly 
bank of new england announced earlier this month it was trying 
to sell 6 billion worth of assets because it expected to post a 
loss of more than 1 billion in 1989 because of bad real estate 
loans 
the bank said it expected to make a profit of about 176 million 
from selling the credit card business analysts said the ability to 
raise more than 800 million in cash was more important 
this relieves some of the funding pressure on them said 
gerard cassidy a banking analyst with tucker anthony inc it 
gives them a little more breathing room 
the bank last week had to borrow money from the federal reserve 
bank of boston as small and large depositors withdrew millions of 
dollars 
bank and federal officials have not confirmed the amount 
borrowed but it was believed to be around 450 million 
the sale of the credit card business must be approved by banking 
regulators tom lavelle a bank spokesman said approval normally 
would take about a month but both bank of new england and citicorp 
are trying to get the deal cleared in short order

the national the allsports newspaper that 
debuts wednesday in three big cities is going to test the american 
appetite for sports with 30plus pages of stories analysis color 
photos and slickly presented statistics six days a week 
publisher peter o price and his old college buddy frank 
deford are going to give readers a regular diet of what price 
says most men buy their hometown daily newspaper for sports 
coverage 
deford the former sports illustrated writer is the editor in 
charge of a 125person editorial staff price says the owners have 
the patience and the money to give the new tabloid whatever 
time is needed to succeed 
wednesdays launch in new york los angeles and chicago is 
expected to cost 25 million the paper will be published sunday 
through friday and cost 50 cents a copy it will be available at 
first only at newstands and machines 
the national is being backed by emilio azcarraga a 
publicityshy media baron from mexico who is a major exporter of 
spanishlanguage tv programming azcarraga is the lead member of a 
partnership that includes price and others and is prepared price 
said to spend 100 million to make it profitable 
the national will offer a core of national sports coverage 
including columns investigations gossip and cartoons each citys 
issue will have expanded coverage of its local teams 
plans are to expand gradually into other major cities such as 
detroit dallas philadelphia boston and san francisco with a 
target of being in 15 cities by the end of 1990 
the launch comes at a treacherous economic juncture forecasters 
are divided on whether a recession looms ahead national ad 
spending has been sluggish and competition among media outlets for 
ads has never been fiercer 
in addition the paper faces the longerterm test of winning 
over a national audience 
john morton newspaper analyst for the investment firm lynch 
jones amp ryan notes the country has seldom supported national 
newspapers he said one of the few successes gannett co incs 
usa today already provides considerable sports information 
local papers on the other hand can easily expand their sports 
coverage if they sense a threat from the new national sports daily 
he said 
the key issue facing the national morton said is this is 
there that much interest in spectator sports news on a daily 
basis 
price said the success of allsports programming on cable 
television has demonstrated a hearty us appetite for sports a 
former publisher of the new york post price said readers will buy 
the national in addition to their local paper 
the nationals ad sales director peter a spina said 
discounted advertising sales are ahead of projections with almost 
1200 pages of ads ordered before the launh surpassing an initial 
goal of 1000 advertisers include procter amp gamble co philip 
morris cos and general motors corp 
the newspaper is counting heavily on circulation for revenue at 
least at the start the initial target is average daily circulation 
of 200000 
readers can expect the bestwritten and bestlooking newspaper 
in the country said deford who quit sports illustrated to take 
the editors job and hired bigname columnists like mike lupica of 
the new york daily news and scott ostler of the los angeles times 
each days paper will run 32 to 48 tabloidsized pages with a 
minimum of 30 pages of editorial material and color photography 
deford said 
price said the venture is expected to reach the breakeven point 
in five years which would be something of a feat given that usa 
today expects to make its first yearly profit in 1990 after losing 
800 million over seven years 
putting out a national newspaper is an extraordinarily costly 
endeavor said usa today president thomas curley adding that it 
would be difficult to contain losses for a national startup to 100 
million 
some industry analysts expect the national will compete for 
readers with usa today one of usa todays drawing cards has been 
getting west coast scores into the papers distributed on the east 
coast 
price said the national will be comparable to most of the 
papers in terms of getting late scores into the new york and 
chicago editions but he said that for the first month only one 
edition will be printed for those two cities and the deadline will 
be between 1230 am and 1 am est 
despite the competition in the field many observers of the 
publishing industry say they hope the paper makes it 
we are usually very skeptical about things like this but i 
think this one has a better than average chance to succeed said 
jack irving director of media operations at saatchi amp saatchi 
advertising 
he said many countries have national sports dailies and the 
united states may be ready for one as well the financing appears 
solid and price and deford are experienced i look at it fairly 
positively he said

harried business travelers weighed down 
with suitcases and overcoats will soon be able to let their voice 
do the dialing on longdistance calls us sprint said 
the nations thirdlargest longdistance company on monday 
announced it would offer the first voiceactivated dialing service 
sometime between april and june to customers in selected markets 
the service would allow a caller to say his name and a password 
instead of using sprints longdistance travel card which requires 
a caller to punch in as many as 24 digits 
in addition the caller could speeddial certain preregistered 
numbers by barking orders such as call home into a phone 
these are the features the traveling public tells us they 
want said syd courson spokesman for kansas citybased sprint 
american telephone amp telegraph co said it has the technology to 
offer similar voiceactivated services and is conducting trials to 
determine what features customers want atampt spokeswoman fran 
anderson said some products could be announced in 1990 
theres lots of technology out there anderson said the 
real test now is applying it to what customers need 
a spokesman for mci communications corp the nations 
secondlargest longdistance company said his company is studying 
voiceactivated calling but has no plans to introduce a service 
we dont feel the technology is ready to roll out spokesman 
joe mcnamara said in st louis 
sprint said its new system aimed at business travelers would 
guard against unauthorized use of calling cards by ensuring the 
callers voice matched a preregistered voice pattern 
the system is designed to adapt to slight changes in a callers 
voice over time although there are some limits 
puberty might be a problem courson said 
also the caller might have to punch in a code number if he or 
she had a bad cold or laryngitis courson said 
the new sprint system would not totally eliminate punching in 
numbers courson said a caller would have to dial an 800 number to 
gain access to the voiceactivated network before doing the rest of 
the dialing by voice 
the sprint system also would allow callers to leave voice 
messages at numbers that are busy or go unanswered atampt earlier 
this month announced a similar system using an 800 number called 
voicemark messaging and currently available only in atlanta 
courson said several hundred thousand customers could use the 
new sprint system by early summer but he would not specify what 
markets would get it first or its price 
testing on the system began in december 1988 said larry lake 
senior vice president of product management the company unveiled 
the service sunday in commercials broadcast during the super bowl 
us sprint which controls about 8 percent of the domestic 
longdistance market is owned 80 percent by united 
telecommunications inc of kansas city gte corp of stamford 
conn owns the remaining 20 percent

chrysler corps newest wrinkle in the auto 
industrys patchwork of incentives could cost the financially 
strapped automaker millions of dollars 
but chrysler which is offering 50 to anyone who test drives 
its cars or trucks against any other thinks the gamble is worth it 
nobody ever said promotion was cheap chrysler spokesman tom 
houston said monday the name of the game is to get people in the 
drivers seat 
chrysler amid a program to carve 1 billion in costs out of its 
26 billion annual budget by the end of the year announced its 
newest incentive program sunday in commercials during the super 
bowl football game 
the new incentive offers 50 to anyone who test drives a 
chrysler product and any other comparable car or truck and buys 
either one it doesnt matter which vehicle the consumer buys to 
qualify for the 50 
the company also said it was extending to the end of next month 
some incentives announced dec 15 that originally were scheduled to 
expire wednesday 
its anyones guess how many people will take chrysler up on its 
test drive but if the company offered 50 only to the people who 
bought one of the 64000 cars chrysler sold last month it would 
have handed out 32 million 
charles brady an automotive analyst with oppenheimer amp co in 
new york city said he didnt think the cost of the testdrive 
promotion would be unreasonable 
i dont think many people will go through the hassle for 
50 brady said probably half of them are going to end up 
buying a chrysler when viewed in light of all the other 
incentives thats onetwentieth of a 1000 rebate 
incentives have been denting earnings for chrysler general 
motors corp and ford motor co for months each of the big three 
report their fourthquarter and yearend earnings for 1989 within 
three weeks and analysts are estimating they will be significantly 
lower than in the previous year 
some speculate that chrysler may not turn a profit in the fourth 
quarter if that happens it would be the first quarter in which an 
automaker has lost money since the fourth quarter of 1982 when 
chrysler lost 236 million and ford lost 961 million 
more than 90 percent of the cars and trucks chrysler sells will 
be covered in the extended incentive program houston said 
missing from the extended program are chryslers popular 
minivans the dodge caravan plymouth voyager and chrysler town 
and country 
the incentive offers on those models the first on minivans in 
chrysler history will expire wednesday as originally planned the 
incentives had boosted sales strongly

labor leaders at united airlines say theyll make 
a formal bid for parent ual corp in due time but thats not what 
takeover speculators want to hear 
uals stock plunged to a sevenmonth low monday amid pessimism 
about the prospects that uniteds employees will succeed in their 
plan to buy 75 percent of the parent company 
the airlines pilots flight attendants and machinists are 
negotiating with representatives of uals board to develop a formal 
offer a process that could take months 
but time is not on the side of speculators who buy stock in 
anticipation of a takeover said analyst robert joedicke of 
shearson lehman hutton inc 
if youre an arbitrager time is money joedicke said 
speculators looking for a quick return will lose money if theyre 
going to have to sit around and wait while theres a soap opera 
going on he said 
an arbitrage specialist at one large wall street brokerage said 
his firm had sold all its ual holdings 
were just taking it easy and were going to wait and see if 
the market corrects said the arbitrager who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
union officials declined to comment monday but in phonein 
recorded messages to their members they pleaded for patience while 
buyout plans are negotiated 
other factors dampening investor enthusiasm for ual are the 
current disarray in the junk bond market a major source of funds 
for takeovers a lack of details about the proposed ual deal and a 
history of discord between uniteds pilots and machinists and 
uals poor fourthquarter results 
the debt markets have turned so sour that investors may be 
telling the unions that even if you are getting together the debt 
markets just arent going to absorb any more debt from a new ual 
said stephen dexter an analyst with kemper financial services inc 
in chicago 
ual fell 1350 in new york stock exchange trading monday to 
13650 its lowest price since late june 
uniteds unionized pilots machinists and flight attendants 
proposed on wednesday to buy a 75 percent stake in the 
chicagobased company leaving the rest of the stock with the 
public 
on thursday uals board instructed its advisers to work with 
the unions in developing a formal bid the union proposal did not 
mention the likely price of its offer how it would finance the 
deal or the future role of chairman stephen wolf and other top 
executives 
also on thursday ual reported a 67 percent drop in its 
fourthquarter profit because of takeoverrelated costs high fuel 
expenses and an industrywide decline in ridership 
analysts said economic uncertainty has created a poor 
environment for any debtfinanced takeover attempts let alone a 
bid for a company that has suffered one failed buyout already in 
the past six months

the boeing co reported increased profits and 
sales for 1989 despite a 48day strike by machinists and dismal 
performance by defense segments 
the aerospace and defense contractor also forecast monday that 
its 1990 sales would climb by 35 percent to about 27 billion 
boeing is reaping the rewards of five straight years of record 
commercial jetliner orders but said the strike by machinists 
which ended nov 20 resulted in sales being off by about 2 
billion for its fourth quarter 
boeing said earnings fell nearly 56 percent in the 
fourthquarter compared with the same 1988 period while sales were 
virtually the same as a year ago 
its certainly better than i thought even with the strike 
said george podrasky jr an analyst with duff amp phelps in chicago 
boeing had profits of 77 million or 34 cents per share on 
sales of 485 billion in the fourth quarter compared with 174 
million or 76 cents per share on sales of 488 billion in the 
1988 quarter 
for the year boeing reported profits of 973 million or 423 
a share up 58 percent from 614 million or 268 a share in 
1988 sales were 203 billion up nearly 20 percent from 17 
billion a year earlier 
in 1989 boeing changed its method for computing income taxes 
which had the effect of increasing 1989 earnings by 298 million 
or 129 a share the company said profits would have been up 
about 10 percent for 1989 without that change 
excluding the effects of the accounting change the higher 
profits were due mostly to increased sales and lower research 
development and other business costs for commercial jets and 
computing 
but much of that was offset by the strike large losses on some 
government programs higher federal taxes and higher research and 
development costs on defense work boeing said 
boeings defense and space businesses which were consolidated 
jan 1 had an operating loss of 474 million for 1989 compared 
with operating profits of 29 million a year earlier us 
government and foreign military sales totaled 59 billion in 1989 
up 371 million from 1988 
a series of defense programs are behind schedule including two 
new air force one jets that are more than a year overdue a project 
to put new wings on navy a6 jets the peace shield airborne 
warning and control system for saudi arabia and the airborne 
optical adjunct a star wars project 
while boeing has been telegraphing they would lose money on 
defense i think the enormity of the defense and space loss was a 
surprise podrasky said 
paul nisbet an analyst with prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york said the poor results may be temporary 
undoubtedly this is something that can be rectified over 
time nisbet said he said most of boeings big moneylosing 
contracts either will be canceled or completed within a few years 
boeing set an industry record for commercial jet orders in 1989 
at 963 planes worth 475 billion at yearend the company had a 
firmorder backlog worth 806 billion 74 billion of that for 
commercial customers compared with 536 billion at the end of 
1988 
since then boeing has picked up an order from singapore 
airlines for 15 747400s and options for another 15 worth a total 
55 billion and america west on monday ordered two 747400s and 
took options on two more in a deal worth 280 million 
international lease finance corp and japan air systems also have 
said they plan large purchases of boeing aircraft 
despite the strike boeing delivered 342 planes last year five 
more than in 1988 for 1990 it plans to deliver 455 aircraft the 
figures include turboprop commuter planes from its canadian 
subsidiary de havilland 
boeing attributed its 1990 sales projection primarily to higher 
commercial aircraft deliveries and from some major defense and 
space programs including the e3 airborne warning and control 
system ch47 helicopter navy e6 communications plane and a6 
rewing and the space station

when democratic leaders of congress balked at 
cutting capital gains taxes last year they pointed to bush 
administration estimates that a reduction would worsen the budget 
deficit in three of the next 10 years 
president bush renewed the battle on monday with a new set of 
figures indicating a capital gains reduction would never reduce tax 
collections 
we see no negative effect in any year a senior treasury 
department official told reporters the new estimates are based on 
projections that a larger number of taxpayers would sell assets in 
response to the lower tax rate the official said 
the administration predicted cutting taxes on capital gains 
profits from the sale of real estate stock and other investments 
would actually increase tax collections in each of the next five 
years by a total of 125 billion 
bushs somewhat different proposal last year would have raised 
16 billion by treasury estimates over the first five years lost 
20 billion over the next three and then begun producing revenue 
again congressional analysts predicted small revenue increases in 
the first two years followed by declines in each successive year 
bush says a capital gains reduction is needed to spur investment 
in job creation and make the united states more competitive with 
foreign countries he also called for a new tax break to encourage 
individual saving 
under those two major revenue proposals 
when fully effective in 1992 30 percent of capital gains from 
property owned three years or longer would be exempt from tax 20 
percent from assets owned two years and 10 percent from property 
owned at least one year most property including real estate and 
timber but not collectibles would qualify 
retroactive to jan 1 a couple whose income is 120000 or 
less could set aside up to 5000 a year in a family savings 
account and interest earned would be taxexempt if the account is 
held for at least seven years deposits of up to 2500 a year 
would be allowed single people with income under 60000 the 
deposits would not be tax deductible 
democratic leaders say a capital gains cut would begin undoing 
the landmark 1986 tax overhaul which taxed gains at the same rates 
that apply to other income and 80 percent of the benefits would go 
to those with incomes of 100000 a year 
house majority leader richard gephardt dmo revived the 
fairness argument monday at a time when president bush wants to 
cut the capital gains tax for the wealthy and maintain punishingly 
high social security taxes on everyone else i question whether his 
priorities are right for the times he said 
the president took note of a wellpublicized proposal by sen 
daniel patrick moynihan dny that would cut social security 
taxes to stop the government from using surplus social security 
revenues to pay for other programs bush declined to endorse such a 
reduction instead he proposed that once the federal budget is 
balanced social security surpluses be used to retire government 
debt 
bushs budget recommends 157 billion in tax increases but no 
general boost in income taxes and a 56 billion increase in user 
and service fees 
the president proposed 18 billion in tax reductions in 
addition to the capital gains cut including a new credit of up to 
1000 a year for each child under age 4 in lowincome families 
among other revenue proposals the budget would 
make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long distance 
telephone service which is due to expire dec 31 
raise the 8 percent tax on airline tickets to 10 percent 
more than triple the fee on waterway shippers to 0125 percent 
of cargo value 
require the 38 million state and local government workers who 
are not covered by a retirement plan to pay social security taxes 
also state and local workers hired before april 1 1986 would be 
required to pay the 145 percent medicare tax that most such 
employees already pay

congressional approval of president bushs new 
budget would allow the internal revenue service to increase the 
number of tax returns it audits but not by much 
irs commissioner fred t goldberg jr told reporters the agency 
anticipates auditing 102 returns per 10000 that will be filed in 
1990 and 103 per 10000 next year that compares with an alltime 
low of 97 per 10000 returns for the 1989 tax year 
the fact remains that there has been a continuing decline in 
audit coverage for a number of years but now we are seeing a 
reversal of the trend goldberg said after bushs proposed budget 
for the 1991 fiscal year was made public monday 
although irs officials agree that more returns should be 
audited they point to concerted efforts over the past few years to 
target larger returns those involving tax shelters and others 
likely to yield more revenue 
even so goldberg said the audit statistics do not tell the 
whole story he noted for example about 40 million couples and 
individuals file returns that are based almost entirely on income 
from wages interest and dividends irs computers now automatically 
check those returns against backup documents filed by employers 
banks and brokers to ensure that all income is reported 
while those computer matches are not audits goldberg said they 
are thorough enough to make it difficult for taxpayers to 
underreport such income 
the agencys proposed budget for 1991 is 614 billion up 116 
percent from this years 55 billion 
a big part of that increase represents another installment on 
the agencys plan to replace an outmoded computer system goldberg 
said the new system will cost up to 6 billion over the next decade 
one aim of the new system is to allow taxpayers to get answers 
to questions about their tax accounts as easily as they get 
information about a bill from a credit card company 
the bush administration estimates the irs will collect an 
additional 3 billion next year because of management initiatives 
and the increase in the agencys own spending 
goldberg said the irs will spend an additional 56 million and 
assign about 1000 new staff members to reducing accounts 
receivable from a record level of nearly 60 billion those are 
taxes that have been assessed but not paid 
the agency expects to spend 330 million in the new year for 
taxpayer service which includes answering telephoned tax 
questions that figure is up from 317 million this year 
principally because last year irs employees gave the wrong answer 
to one of every three telephoned questions

control data corp today reported losses of 
196 million for the fourth quarter and 680 million for last year 
the worst annual performance in the computer makers 32year 
history 
lawrence perlman control datas president and chief executive 
officer has said 1989 marks the end of a sixyear restructuring 
that has included 14 billion in writeoffs 
for the octoberdecember quarter control data lost 463 a 
share on revenue of 524 million that compared with a net loss of 
128 million or 31 cents a share on 933 million in revenue in 
the same 1988 period 
the 1989 net loss of 1611 a share on revenue of 29 billion 
compares with a profit of 17 million or 3 cents a share on 
revenue of 36 billion in 1988 the 1989 loss eclipsed losses of 
568 million in 1985 and 265 million in 1986 
aside from restructuring charges of 215 million in fourth 
quarter and net charges for the year of 663 million control data 
was profitable in its last two quarters perlman said 
the major restructuring actions control data carried out in 
1989 have helped to focus the company and improve its opportunity 
for success in 1990 and beyond perlman said 
the fourthquarter charge was linked largely to the previously 
announced writeoff for anticipated losses at chipmaking 
subsidiary vtc which the company will sell in 1990 perlman said 
vtc never made money in its fiveyear history 
other large writeoffs for the year stemmed from the shutdown of 
eta systems a moneylosing supercomputer subsidiary and a 
streamlining of the companys mainframe business 
another important move during the year was the sale for 470 
million of control datas profitable disc drive subsidiary to 
seagate technology it was completed in september and did not 
contribute to fourthquarter results 
perlman has said the restructuring leaves the company poised to 
make between 50 million and 60 million in 1990 on sales of about 
2 billion six years ago sales at the company were about 5 
billion 
gary smaby a minneapolis computer industry analyst said 
perlman will have to make good on his projection for control data 
to be considered a legitmate turnaround stock 
perlman appears to be the right man smaby said but just 
because they have gone through this gutwrenching subtraction its 
not a slam dunk that they will be a success

company gives him more time to review its financial records

chemicals magnate jon huntsman asked the company to extend its 
deadline for bids until feb 14 huntsman is trying to form a joint 
venture with general electric co to acquire aristech for at least 
27 a share 
a deadline set by a special aristech board committee expired at

expire at the end of business today 
aristech spokesman david higie declined comment today 
i want to emphasize to the special committee and the entire 
board that we genuinely want to acquire aristech huntsmans

reasonable period of time to complete a reasonable due diligence

analysts called a key reversal an indication that the markets 
sixweek downward trend might have ended 
the resulting acrosstheboard rally continued into todays

the market needs to go back down and retest support to give 
traders confidence that the key reversal is intact said william 
biedermann director of research for the futures brokerage 
allendale inc in crystal lake ill 
a drop to mondays lows followed by a higher close would confirm 
the reversal he said

international bankers were told but didnt 
care that suitcases of cash deposited in their vaults came from 
colombian cocaine dealers prosecutors said today as a 32 million 
moneylaundering trial opened 
the six defendants include amjad awan an international banker 
who once claimed to handle manuel noriegas secret accounts 
assistant us attorney michael rubenstein described how 
proceeds fom cocaine sales were turned into cash and filtered 
through the defendants institution the luxembourgbased bank of 
credit and commerce international 
an undercover customs agent in detroit would pick up suitcases 
of cash from strangers then call a contact in medellin colombia 
to advise him he said the money was converted into certificates 
of deposit which were used first as collateral for loans then to 
pay them off as they matured 
the undercover agent told awan where the money came from 
rubenstein said 
and awan responded its not any business of mine who the 
customers are the prosecutor quoted the agent as saying 
the defense was expected to begin its opening arguments later in 
the day 
us district judge w terrell hodges on jan 17 denied a 
defense motion to block any mention of noriega during the trial 
awan a former latin american assistant division director for 
the bank of credit and commerce told a senate panel in 1988 he 
managed secret accounts for noriega that held up to 23 million 
on trial with awan are rudolph armbrect of medellin colombia 
and four former employees of the bank 
just before the start of jury selection two weeks ago guilty 
pleas were entered by the luxembourg bank and a colombian who 
prosecutors said ran a network to help traffickers hide the source 
of their drug money 
as part of a plea bargain the bank one of the worlds largest 
private financial institutions agreed to forfeit a record 14 
million in assets frozen by the government and to cooperate against 
other defendants 
gonzalo mora jr pleaded guilty to drug trafficking conspiracy 
and money laundering 
the indictment resulted from a twoyear sting in which an 
undercover agent conned his way into an international money 
laundering network 
after that agents helped direct profits from cocaine sales in 
american cities to colombia through panama eventually building a 
global laundering operation worth an estimated 32 million 
investigators said 
customs agents claimed the money was intended mainly for 
colombian drug traffickers including the medellin cartel 
awan was arrested while attending a phony stag party for a groom 
who was an undercover customs agent 
noriega is being held in miami on charges he accepted millions 
of dollars in bribes for allowing the cartel to launder money and 
process and ship drugs through panama to the united states

complex being built in a columbus suburb gov richard celeste and 
company officials said tuesday 
lane bryant a womens special size apparel retailer is 
expected to move into its new headquarters in may or june of 1991 
kenneth b gilman limiteds executive vice president and chief 
financial officer said a significant but undetermined number of 
the 240 employees at lane bryants manhattan headquarters were 
expected to move to ohio 
three other new yorkbased divisions henri bendel brylane 
and lerner that together employ 800 to 1000 people will remain 
in new york 
gilman said at a news conference that the lane bryant division 
is expanding 
our plans for lane bryant include building that business to 
achieve sales in excess of 2 billion its somewhat less than 1 
billion at this point he said 
the home office work force will be significantly higher than 240 
people once the sales goal is achieved he said 
the lane bryant offices and distribution center will be housed 
in one of two buildings at a site in reynoldsburg about 10 miles 
east of columbus in addition to the 950000 square feet lane 
bryant building a 910000squarefoot structure will house 
victorias secret stores and catalogue offices and distribution 
centers

columbus already employs 4000 people in central ohio it operates 
3176 stores around the country under the names limited express 
victorias secret henri bendel lerner lane bryant and 
abercrombie amp fitch 
celeste viewed the switch as an affirmation that a national 
business can thrive from a base in central ohio 
what to me is more important than the size of the site is what 
it means to bring the lane bryant headquarters here to join with 
the already very enormous commitment that the limited has to 
columbus and central ohio celeste said 
the state has committed 2 million to widen a highway leading to

borden inc on tuesday reported a 65 percent 
fourthquarter earnings gain despite a 15 percent sales drop due 
largely to a decline in the dairy business 
a previously announced 5707 million pretax charge resulted in 
a 606 million loss for all of last year 
borden earned 9991 million or 67 cents a share in the three 
months ended dec 31 up from 9385 million or 63 cents a share 
in the corresponding 1988 quarter sales fell to 195 billion from 
198 billion 
rj ventres chairman and chief executive officer said 
bordens grocery and specialty products divisions improved 
substantially during the quarter led by the pasta business but 
the growth was partly offset by the severe squeeze on profit 
margins in our dairy division 
the reserve which came to 4044 million after taxes or 273 
a share was established to cover the costs of a corporatewide 
reconfiguration and various restructuring programs 
a major portion of the plans announced sept 28 involved 
restructuring bordens dairy operation and getting out of 
overcrowded markets 
the sum set aside led to the 1989 loss which amounted to 41 
cents a share and compared with a profit of 31188 million or 
211 a share in 1988 last years sales rose 48 percent to 759 
billion from 1988s 724 billion 
excluding the onetime charge borden said its 1989 earnings 
increased 319 million or 102 percent

grain and soybean futures prices closed 
moderately lower tuesday on the chicago board of trade following an 
unconfirmed report that soviet leader mikhail gorbachev might 
resign as communist party chairman 
the midafternoon report on the cable news network stirred fears

and less foreign trade including fewer purchases of foreign grain 
the cnn report attributed to an unidentified source said 
gorbachev would remain president of the soviet union a white house 
spokesman said the bush administration had no information on the 
report 
the report overshadowed bullish sentiments linked to mondays 
strong rebound in the soybean market which some analysts had said 
could mark a turnaround in the markets sixweek decline 
but crop futures were trading lower even before the cnn report 
surfaced 
there was no followthrough from yesterday said analyst 
joel karlin of research department inc a brokers advisory 
service 
at the close wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 376 a bushel corn futures

once selfproclaimed the most 
innovative company in the world control data corp has entered the 
1990s as a much smaller business scarred by 14 billion in losses 
in the past five years 
the loss of 6804 million for 1989 reported tuesday was the 
worst performance in the computer companys 32year history it 
eclipsed the 1985 loss of 5675 million the previous worst batch 
of red ink 
in fact in the 1980s control data lost twice as much money as 
it earned 143 billion vs 6641 million 
to fix things management has lopped off huge subsidiaries and 
parted ways with founder william c norris the moves will reduce 
sales to an estimated 2 billion in 1990 compared with 5 billion 
in 1984 
theyve cut off the patients legs arms and nose said 
peter zidek a supercomputer consultant who once worked for control 
data theres not much left to operate on 
launched as a maker of mainframe scientific computers control 
data diversified quickly into financial services by leasing 
industrial equipment and selling insurance in 1977 for example 
control data made about 106 million on insurance sales six times 
what the entire company earned in 1988 
the companys farflung enterprises also came to include 
windmill farms factories built in ghettos incubation centers for 
small businesses and a training program that encouraged city 
dwellers to take up farming 
we were in too many businesses said control data spokesman 
frank ryan managements focus can only go so far 
the remedy carried out mostly by norris successor robert 
price has been to sell more than 20 businesses or product lines 
since 1984 
the selloffs in 1989 included a disk drive subsidiary that 
accounted for a third of control datas 362 billion revenues in 
1988 and the shutdown of supercomputer subsidiary eta systems the 
latter lost more than 230 million in its sixyear life and cost 
335 million to close 
another major downsizing occurred in 1986 and 1987 when 
control data cut all ties to commercial credit the financial 
services subsidiary that throughout much of the 1970s generated 
more profit than the companys computer business 
the changes have coincided with a 72 percent reduction in 
employment at control data from a high of 60600 in 1981 to about 
17000 at the end of 1989 
later this year 400 more jobs will be cut from control data 
when the company sells it vtc chipmaking subsidiary mostly to 
cover anticipated losses at vtc the company wrote off about 2147 
million in the fourth quarter resulting in a net loss of 1964 
million or 463 a share 
newly appointed president lawrence perlman has said vtc should 
be the last writeoff in control datas sixyear effort to 
transform itself into a computerbased services company he is 
projecting a profit of up to 63 million this year 
gary smaby a computer industry analyst in minneapolis said 
perlman must meet that projection if control data is to be 
considered a legitimate turnaround stock in 1983 the stock traded 
as high as 6325 a share on monday it closed at 1625 on the new 
york stock exchange 
a darling of securities analysts perlman made his mark at 
control data by transforming the moneylosing disk drive subsidiary 
into a major profit center before it was sold 
but just because they have gone through this gutwrenching 
subtraction its not a slam dunk that they will be a success 
smaby said 
whats left of control data includes an installed computer base 
of 1500 mainframes and 1500 workstations maintaining the base is 
a huge business but the company isnt likely to add greatly to its 
own hardware smaby said 
instead control data will be devising new applications with 
hardware made by others 
you dont have to be designing the computer anymore you cant 
sell enough of them to underwrite the costs said lloyd 
thorndyke a cofounder of eta systems control data is down to 
services using computers to manipulate data the way customers 
like it 
control data divides its businesses into two categories data 
services and data systems services includes the arbitron tv 
ratings unit payroll processing and ticketron data systems is the 
computer core 
zidek said much of the malaise at control data stemmed from the 
overall softness in the computer industry but the company was hurt 
more than others because its direction under norris was diluted by 
social endeavors he said in addition zidek said the 
engineerladen leadership didnt pay enough attention to marketing 
in control datas 1979 annual report norris wrote simply 
stated there is no more innovative company in the world

restaurant holdings including 235 bobs big boys and an assortment 
of moderately priced restaurants it runs under the howard 
johnsons wags bickfords and allies names it said it hopes to 
raise at least 500 million from the sales 
william e prather jr hardees president and chief executive 
said the acquisition would improve his companys presence in the 
northeast 
its a sound strategic fit for us he said in a telephone 
interview we look forward to a successful blending of the 
chains 
prather said the companyowned restaurants will be converted to 
hardees on a marketbymarket basis existing roy rogers franchise 
agreements will be honored 
we have an obligation to run the roy rogers chain forever if 
necessary he said 
tuesdays deal is the third major acquisition by hardees the 
200unit sandys system was purchased in 1982 and the 650unit 
burger chef chain was bought in 1982 
hardees annual sales through 3300 restaurants in 40 states and 
nine foreign countries amount to about 35 billion

steadying as the nearby contracts expired said greg dreis an 
analyst at merrill lynch energy futures 
a cnn report that soviet president mikhail gorbachev was 
considering resigning as communist party chief injected uncertainty 
into many financial markets and spurred buying in the crude oil 
pits but the impact of the report from moscow was short lived

interest rates anytime soon

percent lower than previously anticipated and that the current

gold prices were mixed on new yorks commodity exchange a troy 
ounce of gold fell 1 to close at 41810 republic national bank 
later quoted a bid of 41830 a troy ounce up 10 cents from monday 
the report by cable news network about 2 pm est said gorbachev 
may step down as party leader but retain his post as president cnn 
quoted sources as saying the move would alllow gorbachev to 
distance himself from the party amid internal turmoil in the soviet 
union 
in new york the dollar soared to a high of 146 yen from 14298

not give up all its gains 
it reached panic proportions said mike ballow a currency 
markets analyst for dean witter reynolds inc the move was 
incredible and probably irrational 
richard levine vice president for precious metals and foreign 
exchange at elders futures inc said i dont think the rumor 
can be denied or confirmed but i think the markets reaction to 
even the possibility of further instability really tells us the 
story that when push comes to shove if one has to hold currency 
theres no safer currency in the world than the us dollar 
at the very least the gorbachev scare gave traders the 
opportunity to reverse the dollars recent direction 
i think the central banks have artificially kept the dollar 
down by their relentless intervention through dollarselling 
levine said

sugar futures prices fell sharply tuesday on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange after a rally prompted by a reduced world 
production forecast sputtered and failed 
on other commodity markets grain and soybean futures fell 
energy futures were mostly lower livestock and meat futures were 
mixed and precious metal futures retreated 
sugar futures settled 36 cent to 46 cent lower with the 
contract for delivery in march down 43 cent at 1444 cents a pound 
the market rallied strongly early in the session after the west 
german statistical firm fo licht released a revised 198990 world 
sugar production forecast of 1065 million metric tons about 12 
million tons below its previous estimate 
licht said crops in several countries had not lived up to 
expectations and the resulting tightening of supplies created the 
potential for explosive upward price movement if a large consumer 
country such as the soviet union china or india were to enter the 
world market as a buyer 
unconfirmed rumors of soviet buying kept traders on edge last 
week 
tuesdays rally pushed the march contracts price up to 1505 
cents a pound but buyers turned sellers when it became apparent 
the march price would not top its lifetime high of 1538 cents 
the thing just fed on itself and we had the market ending flat 
on its face said arthur stevenson an analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc in new york 
from a fundamental perspective he said the initial response to 
the licht report may have been tempered by expectations that an 
upcoming companion report will predict a decline in world sugar 
consumption 
grain and soybean futures settled moderately lower on the 
chicago board of trade following a report that soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev might resign as communist party chairman 
the midafternoon report on the cable news network stirred fears 
of a change in the soviet union toward more isolationist policies 
and less foreign trade including fewer purchases of foreign grain 
the report overshadowed bullish sentiments linked to mondays 
strong rebound in the soybean market which some analysts had said 
could mark a turnaround in the markets sixweek decline 
wheat futures settled 1 cent to 2 cents lower with the contract 
for delivery in march at 376 a bushel corn futures were cent 
to 1 cents lower with march at 238 a bushel oats were cent 
to 1 cent lower with march at 137 a bushel soybeans were 1 
cents to 5 cents lower with march at 558 a bushel 
energy futures ended mostly lower on the new york mercantile 
exchange ahead of the american petroleum institutes weekly 
inventory report which showed largerthanexpected supplies across 
the board 
the api reported a smallerthanexpected 678000barrel decline 
in crudeoil supplies last week a 73millionbarrel increase in 
gasoline supplies and a 47millionbarrel rise in supplies of 
petroleum distillates which include home heating oil 
west texas intermediate crude oil futures settled 5 cents to 34 
cents lower with march at 2246 a barrel heating oil was 104 
cent lower to 05 cent higher with february at 6051 cents a 
gallon unleaded gasoline was 09 cent to 55 cent lower with

a utah businessman who missed a deadline to 
submit a bid for aristech chemical corp said tuesday he hasnt 
given up hope and might sweeten his offer 
salt lake city chemicals magnate jon huntsman has asked aristech 
to set a new feb 14 deadline to give him time to review financial 
data and form a joint venture with general electric cos ge 
plastics division based in pittsfield mass 
the 5050 joint venture could enable huntsman to offer at least 
27 a share or 9342 million for the pittsburghbased company 
according to a letter huntsman sent tuesday to aristech board 
member rs evans his earlier 25 a share offer was spurned 
i want to emphasize to the special committee and the entire 
board that we genuinely want to acquire aristech said huntsmans 
letter which was publicly released the fact is however that 
it is not reasonable for you to expect us to make our formal 
proposal until we have had a reasonable period of time to complete 
a reasonable due diligence review of your company 
a deadline set by a special aristech board committee expired at 
5 pm monday the companys stock remained unchanged at 2525 at 
the close of trading tuesday on the new york stock exchange 
the committee set the deadline after aristech managers and 
mitsubishi corp of japan said their 26ashare offer worth 
8996 million would expire at the end of business tuesday the 
senior management group is led by aristech chairman thomas marshall 
mitsubishi spokesman peter rosenthal declined to comment tuesday 
on the status of that offer 
aristech spokesmen david higie and harry varner also declined 
comment tuesday 
aristech which employs about 1800 people in eight states has 
reserved the option of rejecting any of the firstround offers and 
suggested that if none is high enough it will reopen bidding 
in his letter huntsman said he needs to see more aristech 
financial records to finalize an offer 
after signing a confidentiality agreement jan 24 huntsman 
received certain limited financial information on aristech his 
letter said however as we have advised you we need access to 
considerable additional information and people 
huntsman also complained he hasnt had time to visit aristechs 
facilities review various documents at the companys headquarters 
meet with the companys independent auditors or talk with most of 
the companys senior officers

the limited inc said tuesday it is moving 
headquarters of the 720store lane bryant division from new york to 
a columbus suburb so it can be in a better position to help the 
specialty womens apparel chain improve 
kenneth b gilman executive vice president and chief financial 
officer for the columbusbased parent company said the move 
involving 240 jobs did not reflect a decision to cut costs 
it was a desire to improve the performance of that business 
gilman said 
gilman said he did not know how many of the buyers accountants 
and other lane bryant employees would transfer from new york when 
the new headquarters opens in may or june of 1991 
three other new yorkbased divisions henri bendel brylane and 
lerner which together employ 800 to 1000 people will remain in 
new york 
they operate well in that environment we think lane bryant 
which has i think suffered a bit in recent years would benefit 
from being located in the central ohio area gilman said 
the limited and all other divisions are based in columbus 
our plans for lane bryant include building that business to 
achieve sales in excess of 2 billion its somewhat less than 1 
billion at this point when we achieve that goal of course the 
home office work force will be significantly higher than 240 
gilman said 
donald trott an analyst with dean witter reynolds said lane 
bryant has been struggling to find its fashion identity in 
trying to appeal to customers who prefer contemporary designs and 
thoses who are conservative 
the sales have not kept pace with the other major divisions of 
the limited he said the challenge has been in trying to find 
some middle ground of direction 
the limited operates 3176 specialty apparel stores nationwide 
through the limited express victorias secret henri bendel 
lerner lane bryant and abercrombie amp fitch it also distributes 
through the victorias secret lerner lane bryant and roamans 
catalogues 
the limited acquired lane bryant in 1982

president 
it was predominately the gorbachev report that moved it up 
said bob sbarra senior vice president at carroll mcentee amp 
mcginley inc 
market professionals accounted for most of the buying sbarra 
said 
the cnn report also pushed the dollar sharply higher 
reinforcing the recovery in bonds dealers said a stronger dollar 
makes us bonds more attractive for foreign investors 
if the gorbachev report turns out to be true the market 
effects will not be lasting sbarra speculated such a 
resignation would merely mirror events elsewhere in eastern europe 
where some leaders have resigned from communist parties but hung on 
to government positions he said 
treasuries had weakened in the morning following congressional 
testimony by alan greenspan in which the federal reserve chairman 
warned that inflation remained unacceptably high and said that the 
risk of recession had eased

bonds gained 116 to 532 intermediate maturities rose 18 to 732

in some ways peter cohen fell victim to the 
same problems as several prominent takeover stategists he had big 
dreams for his company but ran into trouble after big acquisitions 
failed to bring the success he expected 
cohen who resigned tuesday as chairman of shearson lehman 
hutton inc built the company from a largely retail brokerage into 
the secondbiggest investment firm on wall street 
the company that started as shearson hayden stone inc took over 
lehman brothers kuhn loeb inc in 1984 and ef hutton amp co in 
1988 and became a powerhouse 
the 43yearold cohen who joined one of the firms predecessors 
in 1971 rose through the ranks to become chief executive officer 
in 1983 and chairman one year later 
shearson and cohen were riding high when the stock market crash 
of oct 19 1987 interrupted wall streets great bull run and sent 
shearson profits skidding 
cohen tried with little success to patch things up recently with 
a senior management shakeup 800 layoffs and a reduction in broker 
commissions but the chairman himself has made some strategic 
blunders that didnt help his firms recovery 
perhaps the most notorious came in 1988 when cohen sided with 
rjr nabisco inc president f ross johnson in johnsons 
multibilliondollar attempt to take the food and tobacco company 
private 
cohen tried and failed to cut a deal with kohlberg kravis 
roberts amp co for a joint bid and then went down to defeat with 
johnson against kkrs winning 25 billion offer 
cohen a new yorker born in 1946 attended ohio state university 
and the columbia university graduate school of business 
after a short stint at reynolds securities inc he joined 
cwblhayden stone inc in 1971 and spent seven years there 
following a oneyear hiatus at republic national bank he returned 
to shearson in 1979 
once chairman cohen went about expanding the investment firm 
into the merger and acquisition field with the blessing of parent 
company american express which acquired shearson in 1981 
at first most of shearsons merchant banking business came from 
small deals and takeover strategists considered corporate raiders 
including asher edelman 
the company did have several big successes including two 
pairings with kohlberg kravis the 243 billion leveraged buyout 
of jim walter corp and the 12 billion lbo of stop amp shop cos 
in 1988 shearson was an equity partner in the 18 billion 
buyout of koppers co by the british firm beazer plc but the deal 
which began as a hostile bid earned shearson and american 
express a lot of bad press in pennsylvania koppers home state 
cohen saw the rjr nabisco deal as a chance to put his firm on 
top among investment bankers and make enough money in fees to help 
its sagging bottom line however the failure of the johnson offer 
remained a black mark for shearson and cohen

twentynine states sued 26 asbestos companies 
tuesday claiming the companies have a duty to reduce hazards 
created by the substance 
the suit filed with the us supreme court asks it to find the 
defendants liable for the cost of abating asbestos hazards in 
public buildings and order restitution to the states said 
washington attorney general kenneth eikenberry 
we are alleging that the defendants had the responsibility to 
provide products that were safe for their intended uses or warn the 
states of the danger posed by their products they did neither 
said eikenberry who is acting as lead attorney in the case 
the products installed in state buildings simply were not safe 
and the states must expend significant sums of money to provide a 
safe environment 
it is unusual for suits to be filed directly with the nations 
high court but the states did so in this case because the issue 
raises major public health environment and finance issues and no 
other adequate forum exists where all the defendants could be sued 
and the resources equitably apportioned after finding liability 
said a press release from eikenberrys office 
eikenberry said washington has been seeking payment for its 
asbestosabatement projects the state recently filed claims 
totaling 927938 with the manville trust which was created after 
the johnsmanville co another asbestos manufacturer filed for 
protection under the federal bankruptcy laws he said 
the state anticipates having to spend about 490 million to 
reduce the asbestos in its buildings 
the estimate for eliminating asbestos hazards in all public and 
commercial buildings across the country ranges from 51 billion to 
750 billion the press release said 
asbestos is a fibrous material that was used widely as 
fireproofing and insulation in buildings around the country fibers 
from the material if inhaled can lodge in the lungs and cause 
asbestosis and other diseases 
matt gonring spokesman for usg corp in chicago one of the 
defendants said he could not comment on the lawsuit because usg 
officials had not seen it 
calls to several other defendant companies failed to reach 
officials qualified to comment 
defendants in the case are wr grace amp co national gypsum 
co united states gypsum co usg corp american biltrite inc 
armstrong world industries inc azrock industries inc basic 
inc careycanada inc the celotex corp certainteed corp

company gave no assurances that any decision would be reached 
tuesday

alternatives

up and reports in the wall street journal indicated that the asian 
bidders had dropped out and that the highest bids for hilton were 
in the 90ashare range 
on jan 24 the stock plunged 875 to close at 6550 on rumors 
that one of those offers from jmb realty corp in chicago had 
been lowered or withdrawn

the nations financial markets were rocked 
tuesday by a cable television report that soviet president mikhail 
gorbachev was considering resigning as communist party chief 
the report by cable news networks moscow bureau immediately 
sent the dollar climbing against foreign currencies and spurred a 
rebound in the bond market traders said stock prices gyrated 
wildly and oil futures prices also rallied 
in almost every case the moves were shortlived as the report 
remained unconfirmed through the close of the markets in the united 
states 
it was a dull day before it happened said william hand a 
trader with first pennsylvania bank in philadelphia 
the report by cnn around 2 pm est said gorbachev may step down 
as party leader but retain his post as president cnn quoted 
sources as saying the move would allow gorbachev to distance 
himself from the party amid internal turmoil in the soviet union 
in washington secretary of state james a baker said the report 
was a rumor and therefore its not something that i think that 
we should respond to or react to 
were following the story as i know you are and well have a 
comment if we ever determine its something more than just a 
rumor said baker 
the same day bakers spokeswoman announced that talks in moscow 
between baker and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze 
have been postponed a day to feb 89 to avoid interfering with a 
meeting of the communist party central committee 
bush administration officials and intelligence sources told the 
associated press that there has been speculation for weeks that 
gorbachev would yield his party post while retaining the 
presidency but that they had no information he would take the 
step 
in currency markets the dollar soared to a high of 146 yen in 
new york from 14298 yen late monday and to 17130 west german 
marks from 16770 marks the day before the dollar eased somewhat 
by late afternoon but did not give up all its gains 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond finished 932 of a 
point higher a gain of about 281 per 1000 face amount the 
bond markets had been slumping for weeks 
on the new york stock exchange prices were so volatile that 
traders at one brokerage temporarily stopped trading until calm was 
restored the dow jones industrial average which had been sliding 
during the afternoon fell more sharply after the gorbachev report 
before recovering some lost ground by the end of the day 
at 230 pm est the dow was reported off 2725 points it 
rebounded into the plus column briefly then fell back to finish 
down 1014 points for the day at 254324 
in the energy markets prices for crude oil futures spiked 
higher on the gorbachev report but finished lower with the the 
contract for march delivery of west texas intermediate off 34 cents 
to 2246 per 42gallon barrel 
much of the frenetic activity was stirred by uncertainty over 
what would happen to the soviet and world economies should 
gorbachev step down the financial markets typically react to a 
range of news reports and rumors 
if he steps down if he loses his stature if somebody else 
gains stature who knows what happens said robert brusca chief 
economist at nikko securities international inc in new york 
the rise in the dollar against foreign currencies and bond 
prices was attributed to the perception that us financial 
instruments are a safe haven in times of turmoil

buttrick a new york analyst with kidder peabody amp co 
layer that in with moody downgrading rjr nabisco securities 
uncertainty in the highyield market all the trouble with deal 
stocks and you create a weak backdrop 
the price of rjr nabiscos highyield bonds plunged on friday 
and monday after moodys investors service lowered its ratings on 
the securities the decline spread gloom throughout the markets 
about the ability of the junk bond market to provide financing for 
major takeovers

make it easier to arrange a buyout because the price would be 
cheaper 
its basic math it makes it easier to do he said 
ual and uniteds unions declined comment on the stock price drop 
the airlines pilots flight attendants and machinists last 
wednesday proposed to buy 75 percent of chicagobased ual and leave 
the remaining shares in public hands the employees are negotiating

property owners around rocky flats and two unions 
sued two former operators of the nuclear weapons plant tuesday 
alleging that slipshod treatment of hazardous wastes caused 
environmental and health problems 
in ohio a 2 billion lawsuit was filed against a former 
operator of another federally owned weapons materials factory the 
fernald uranium processing plant nlo inc and its parent company 
were accused of subjecting employees to a hazardous radioactive 
workplace 
in us district court in denver two classaction lawsuits 
alleged that rockwell international corp and its predecessor dow 
chemical co were careless and negligent in the treatment of 
hazardous wastes at rocky flats 
their actions resulted in repeated releases of both radioactive 
and nonradioactive hazardous substances into the environment and 
violations of state and federal environmental health and safety 
laws the lawsuits alleged 
five residents near the plant west of denver filed one of the 
lawsuits on behalf of about 10000 property owners within a 
fivemile radius of rocky flats and up to 50000 people who live 
within six miles of the plant 
rocky flats which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear 
weapons and has been in operation since 1953 is 16 miles northwest 
of denver and is near the cities of arvada westminster broomfield 
and golden 
dow chemical operated the plant from 1953 until june 30 1975 
when rockwell took over last year the department of energy 
replaced rockwell with egampg inc after the fbi and the 
environmental protection agency raided rocky flats looking for 
evidence of illegal disposal of hazardous wastes 
in their lawsuit the property owners asked the court to issue 
an order preventing further releases of plutonium and radioactive 
and nonradioactive hazardous substances from rocky flats 
the other lawsuit was filed by the building and construction 
trades department aflcio and the construction trades council on 
behalf of more than 10000 current and former workers at the plant 
that suit asks the court to order the defendants to create a 
fund to finance reasonable medical monitoring and surveillance 
services including independent scientific studies of adverse 
health effects 
rockwell officials in el segundo calif declined to comment 
saying they had not seen the court documents dow chemical 
officials at company headquarters in midland mich did not reply 
to calls seeking comment 
several property owners named as plaintiffs in the lawsuit 
declined to comment referring questions to their attorneys 
we think the lawsuits are historic its time to abandon the 
public relations games surrounding rocky flats bob ozinga 
business manager of the colorado building and construction trades 
council said in a statement 
hopefully the lawsuits will benefit the workers the 
community and the plants operations ozinga said 
attorney bruce h deboskey who is representing all the 
plaintiffs said the lawsuits stem from peoples concern and 
their fear over whether or not they have lost money and whether or 
not their health has been affected by the operations at the plant 
that fear was heightened by the fbi raid last summer 
deboskey said in a telephone interview people are afraid 
theyre afraid and they want to know the truth from people other 
than the ones who have caused the pollution 
doe last year identified rocky flats as the most hazardous site 
in the nations nuclear weapons complex saying toxic chemicals 
contaminated an underground reservoir and threatened nearby city 
water supplies 
energy secretary james watkins suspended plutonium processing 
operations at rocky flats in november he said the shutdown would 
remain in effect until doe is convinced safety and health standards 
are being met 
the ohio lawsuit filed in us district court in cincinnati 
accused nlo and parent nl industries inc of failing to properly 
store or contain highly radioactive substances at the feed 
materials production center in fernald 
the plant located in fernald 18 miles northwest of cincinnati 
processes uranium for use in the energy departments production 
elsewhere of nuclear weapons 
the lawsuit says the employees suffered loss of income 
emotional distress including increased fear of cancer and 
diminished ability to obtain other jobs or insurance 
it seeks 2 billion in damages plus unspecified punitive damages 
and payment for extended medical monitoring of the employees 
cincinnati lawyer thomas kircher who filed the lawsuit said he 
is asking us district judge s arthur spiegel to declare it a 
classaction lawsuit on behalf of all former nlo employees in 
addition to subcontractors who worked there while nlo operated the 
plant from 1952 to 1985 
nlo turned over operation of the department of energy plant to 
westinghouse materials co of ohio in 1986 
bob weidner nlos manager in suburban cincinnati declined to 
comment on the lawsuit saying he had not seen a copy
