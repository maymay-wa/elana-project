gov cecil andrus said wednesday his 
decision about signing the most restrictive state abortion law 
wont be swayed by a threatened boycott of idaho potatoes and other 
products by some abortionrights activists 
im going to do what i think is right said andrus who 
promised to act on the bill by saturday the economic things 
those im going to have to handle no matter how it plays out 
andrus said the boycott threat from national organization for 
women president molly yard has prompted calls from leaders of 
idahos food processing industry and its printing travel and 
resort businesses 
all are highly concerned about this andrus said each of 
them has experienced cancellations 
while continuing his silence on his intentions for the bill the 
governor said theres concern on my part but economics is 
not going to be the deciding issue on this 
the bill would ban abortion except in cases of nonstatutory 
rape reported within seven days incest if the victim is under age 
18 severe fetal deformity or pregnancies that threaten the health 
of the mother it would take effect july 1 if signed 
it would ban more than 90 percent of the 1500 abortions 
performed in idaho each year 
the governor is a longtime opponent of abortion except in cases 
of rape incest and to save the life of the woman he said he has 
consulted legal scholars church officials and others but wouldnt 
discuss their advice 
state officials said the monetary effect of the cancellations 
was still being assessed andrus would not identify any of the 
businesses describing one as a very large printing company doing 
business all over the nation 
theres too much outside influence andrus said there are 
too many outofstate experts involved in this if they just give 
us time we idahoans can resolve this 
commerce director james hawkins said several businesses have 
reported cancellations others have received cancellation threats 
if the bill becomes law he said 
more than 600 antiabortion activists rallied wednesday on the 
steps of the capitol to press their case 
in the evening nearly 1000 prochoice activists gathered at 
the capitol for their eighth straight candlelight vigil 
some legal experts maintain the bill is so restrictive it will 
not stand the scrutiny of the us supreme court a test 
abortionrights advocates have promised if the bill becomes law 
antiabortion activists designed the bill to test the courts 
commitment to legalized abortion 
hawkins said antiabortion forces have contacted the state with 
promises to buy more idaho products although those offers have 
been few compared to the boycott threats 
in charleston wva activists were adding bags of idaho 
potatoes to their grocery lists 
were issuing a challenge to the godfearing people of west 
virginia said avis hill spokesman for the 200member west 
virginia parents for life and pastor of touching jesus fellowship 
in alum creek were saying to them if they choose not to buy 
idaho potatoes well buy an extra bag and give it to a food 
pantry 
idaho state sen marti calabretta the leading opponent of the 
bill said she had contacted prochoice activists across the 
country including yard in an unsuccessful attempt to head off 
boycott talk 
i tried to make the persuasive case that it was not in the 
best interests of those of us who have been fighting this bill 
she said evidently the people i talked to had no influence on 
whats happening 
she said any successful boycott would jeopardize state support 
for education and social services and hit hardest at the employees 
in food processing plants and other industries many of whom also 
oppose the bill 
its sad that idaho is the battleground for national interests 
to wage their pitched battles calabretta said

scientists have found evidence that 
people with breast or pancreatic cancer naturally mount an attack 
on their tumors raising hopes for a treatment that might make the 
reaction more powerful 
patients with those diseases produce tumorkilling white blood 
cells that healthy people lack said researcher olivera finn 
she and colleagues have identified a substance on cancer cells 
that appears to be the target of the attack and they hope that a 
vaccinelike treatment might boost the anticancer response she 
said tuesday 
finn an assistant professor in the department of microbiology 
and immunology at the duke university medical center in durham 
nc spoke at a science writers seminar sponsored by the american 
cancer society 
more than 150000 cases of breast cancer and 28000 cases of 
pancreatic cancer are expected to be diagnosed this year 
finn with graduate students donna barnd and keith jerome found 
that patients with either cancer produced immune system cells that 
could kill cancer cells while ignoring normal ones that occurred 
in all 14 pancreatic cancer patients and all six breast cancer 
patients studied finn said 
since no such cells could be found in healthy patients they 
seem to come from a natural response to the tumors she said 
the target of the killer cells was found to be epithelial cell 
mucin which is found on the tumor cells finn said 
tumors probably survive the attack by growing faster than killer 
cells can destroy them she said or perhaps killer cells go after 
mucin that tumor cells secrete in large amounts into the 
bloodstream instead of concentrating their attack on the tumor 
cells themselves 
a vaccine based on mucin might boost the immune system response 
and make it more effective against the cancer she said 
the next step is to do large studies of patients with breast or 
pancreatic cancer to see how strong the natural immune system 
reponse is she said a vaccine may be ready for testing within a 
few years she said 
dr drew pardoll of the johns hopkins university of medicine 
cautioned in a telephone interview that mucin is also produced by 
some normal cells in the body that could present a problem if one 
wants to encourage an immune system attack on the substance he 
said 
but finn said the killer cells do not destroy normal cells in 
the test tube in the body she said the anatomy of organs that 
contain mucinbearing normal cells appears to shield those cells 
from contact with the immune system 
in another presentation patricia steeg of the national cancer 
institute reported the discovery of a gene that appears to suppress 
a cancer cells ability to spread within the body 
in several kinds of cancer the more active the gene was the 
less ability the cancer had to spread she said 
upcoming studies will see if the level of activity of the gene 
called nm23 can predict the spreading behavior of breast lung 
bladder and prostate cancer cells she said 
if the gene does suppress spreading called metastasis it may 
be useful as a tool to find drugs that can hinder that process she 
said 
also at the meeting dr dennis slamon of the university of 
california los angeles school of medicine presented an update on 
studies of another gene called her2neu 
patients whose breast or ovarian cancers show abnormally high 
numbers of copies of this gene per cancer cell had faster relapses 
and shorter survival times he said 
the extra gene copies lead to extra copies of a protein called a 
receptor on the cell surface which may give the cell a growth 
advantage he said the receptor probably snares some kind of 
growthpromoting substance for the cells use he said 
in one experiment the growth of human breast cancers implanted 
in mice declined 80 percent when the receptors functioning was 
blocked by proteins called monoclonal antibodies slamon said when 
the antibodies were removed the suppression disappeared he said 
such antibodies may prove useful someday in therapy he said

president bushs request for 800 million to 
help new democracies in panama and nicaragua is over its first 
congressional hurdle but inflated to 24 billion by the addition 
of an array of domestic spending 
the house appropriations committee gave voice vote approval to 
the money bill late tuesday after cutting 80 million from the 
white houses 500 million request for panama and leaving the 300 
million nicaragua package intact 
battles still lie ahead for the bill however and prospects 
dimmed that it could win final passage by bushs april 5 deadline 
the measure is expected to go to the full house next week then 
must win senate approval 
one of the most potentially divisive issues whether to add 
restrictions on us aid to el salvador was not addressed by the 
appropriations panel 
that disagreement was being fought in the house foreign affairs 
committee which was working on a separate bill needed to implement 
the panama and nicaragua aid 
bush is seeking 800 million for the new governments of 
president guillermo endara in panama and presidentelect violeta 
chamorro in nicaragua to help both countries damaged economies and 
to offer a visible demonstration of the benefits of democracy 
the administration argues that the need is particularly acute in 
nicaragua where the economy is in ruins after a decade of civil 
war and where supplies are needed for the planting season that 
begins in a few weeks 
while the panel approved bushs full 300 million nicaragua 
request it cut the panama package to 420 million freeing 80 
million for other areas where the president had not sought money 
those included 25 million to help feed refugees primarily in 
africa 5 million to help settle soviet jews emigrating to israel 
15 million in economic aid to eastern caribbean countries 5 
million to repair damage in the same region from hurricane hugo 
10 million for the newly independent african country of namibia 
10 million to promote democracy in south africa 25 million for 
zambia 25 million for mozambique and 5 million in african 
development aid not earmarked for a specific country 
the bill also contains 70 million bush asked to bolster the 
fund for us resettlement of refugees to handle an increase of 
27000 in the number coming to the united states this year most of 
those are jews emigrating from the soviet union 
and the measure would offer 400 million in housing loan 
guarantees to israel to help settle soviet jews there in separate 
action on tuesday the house foreign affairs committee approved 
provisions giving israel a cut rate on loan origination fees for 
the package saving that country 3 million along with the lower 
interest rate it would enjoy on the 30year loan 
but as it approved those elements of bushs request the 
committee added 16 billion for a host of politically favored 
domestic programs 
these included 111 million for storm and flood disaster relief 
in the southeast 50 million for additional lowincome energy 
assistance for the northeast 190 million for veterans pensions 
and 50 million for veterans medical care 
also included in the bill were 29 million for judicial 
salaries 510 million to make up an expected shortfall in the food 
stamp program and 96 million to be shifted to states from the 
unemployment trust fund to cover unexpected administrative costs 
due to higher jobless rates 
the committee also adopted an amendment offered by rep sidney 
yates dill to add 442 million for us forest service 
firefighting costs 
the package is to be financed through cuts totaling 18 billion 
in the pentagon budget for this year taken largely from operation 
and maintenance accounts weapons procurement and research and 
development 
that left the overall package still nearly 600 million in the 
red which would require a waiver of grammrudman budget reduction 
strictures when the measure is brought before the full house the 
grammrudman law requires that any new spending be fully offset by 
reductions in other areas of the budget resulting in no net 
increase in the deficit

amnesty international today urged argentina to 
investigate allegations of torture disappearances and killings of 
members of an opposition group that attacked an army barracks last 
year 
the groups report made some of the broadest charges of human 
rights abuses since a civilian government replaced a military 
dictatorship that was responsible for the kidnappings and deaths of 
thousands of people 
amnesty detailed violations against members of the small leftist 
movement for the fatherland which tried to take over an army base 
on the outskirts of buenos aires 
twentyeight attackers and 11 soldiers and police officers died 
in the jan 23 1989 attack on the la tablada base sixty law 
officers were wounded and 13 attackers arrested 
the human rights group urged argentinas president carlos 
menem to order an inquiry in its 21page report the group says 
there appears to be strong evidence that two attackers listed 
as being killed in combat were summarily executed after 
surrendering 
the report also says hree others disappeared after being 
captured and that there was medical evidence to support prisoners 
allegations they were tortured while in custody 
amnesty said argentinas attorney general promised prompt 
inquiries into these complaints in april by the end of the year 
the investigating magistrate had reached a decision in only one 
case 
the report also says some investigations were flawed it cited 
autopsy procedures which it said were not of a high enough 
standard to determine whether deaths had occurred in combat or were 
the result of executions 
the report alleges that security forces raided private homes 
often without warrants following the attack on the base it says 
they threatened and in some cases tortured suspected sympathizers 
armed plainclothes officers reportedly stormed one home without 
formally identifying themselves or producing a warrant tortured 
the couple raped the wife and threatened to kill their 
11monthold child the document alleges 
four women and 16 men including a roman catholic priest were 
convicted in october of planning or carrying out the attack on the 
military base and given sentences ranging from 10 years to life in 
prison 
the attackers said they believed a military coup was imminent 
and that it was being coordinated at the barracks by rebel officers 
argentina was frequently criticized for widespread human rights 
abuses during the 197683 military dictatorship but the subsequent 
civilian government promised to return to the rule of law and 
prosecuted the military leaders for killings torture and 
abductions under their dirty war against suspected leftists 
a government commission found 10000 people were disappeared 
by security and paramilitary forces in the dirty war but human 
rights organizations contend up to 30000 were killed

agriculture secretary clayton yeutter says 
decades of trade negotiations have left farmers out in the cold 
its time to change that he says but it will take a hefty 
dose of political courage on the part of the united states and 
its trading partners 
theres no question in my mind that agriculture is the most 
distortive sector of the world economy when one evaluates existing 
trade patterns yeutter said tuesday 
in the case of industrial goods there has been substantial 
progress in trade liberalization under the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade and there has been a move now under gatt to deal 
with the international aspects of the financial and service sectors 
agriculture has been on the agenda for the past 40 years and 
probably nothing has happened yeutter said weve gone through 
40 years of gatt history through a whole series of multilateral 
trade rounds and for all practical purposes we the members of 
gatt have accomplished nothing in the way of agricultural trade 
liberalization 
the current uruguay round of gatt talks is scheduled to conclude 
at the end of this year 
yeutter told a meeting of the food executives international 
congress that the uruguay round offers great potential for 
liberalization and that the united states has put its own quotas 
and tradedistorting policies on the negotiating table 
but yeutter as he has many times stressed that the united 
states will not disarm unilaterally and that if our trading 
partners wont march were not going to march either 
yeutter said all sorts of schemes are used to avoid trade 
liberalization and that agricultural commodities are favorite 
targets 
if it exists its applied to agriculture he said if 
theres anything that is distortive you can bet your bottom dollar 
its used by some country somewhere to impede agricultural trade 
these devices he said include export subsidies high internal 
price supports quotas and licensing 
yeutter pointedly used japans restrictive import policy on rice 
as an example recently he said a us rice industry group 
participated in a food show in japan and included samples of 
american rice but the japanese government asked that the samples 
be withdrawn 
i wonder about anyones commitment to trade liberalization 
when we cant even show a sample of an american food product in 
japan yeutter said 
the european economic community for years a favorite target of 
us trade officials also was cited by yeutter for boosting 
internal soybean price supports to more than 18 a bushel the us 
price support was 453 for 1989 soybeans 
i told some of them here recently that if you paid me 18 a 
bushel for soybeans id grow them on the alps and i think maybe 
somebodys going to grow them on the alps if that continues very 
much longer he said if you pay farmers enough money theyll 
grow anything anywhere

colder weather has slowed winter wheat 
development in the great plains and may have caused some damage in 
a few southern areas where top growth was heavier according to a 
government report 
the joint agricultural weather facility said tuesday that a 
winter storm brought some beneficial moisture to the northern 
plains during the week of march 1925 
wheat growth in kansas was reported excellent early in the week 
before the cold front moved through 
oklahomas winter wheat was good to fair but freezing 
temperatures damaged some fields with moderate top growth the 
report said cold weather slowed growth in most areas of texas at 
the end of the week 
the weather facility is operated by the agriculture and commerce 
departments weekly reports cover crop conditions but do not 
include production forecasts 
looking at other crops the report said fieldwork progressed 
well in the mississippi delta as fields dried corn planting was 
more than onethird complete in alabama but earlier flooding may 
force some replanting 
rice planting continued in louisiana and cotton farmers 
continued planting in arizona and southern california tobacco was 
reported in goodtofair condition in georgia and north carolina 
and in fairtogood shape in south carolina 
the storm in the northern plains was a hardship for livestock 
and newborn calves despite its moisture benefits for pastures and 
crops the report said pastures were said to be in mostly 
goodtofair condition in the delta and the east

texas has the most stock sheep but when it 
comes to lamb chops count on colorado as no 1 
agriculture department statisticians say the texas inventory was 
about 19 million head as of jan 1 up 11 percent from a year 
earlier 
but colorado remained the largest lambfeeding state with 
385000 head reported up 1 percent from jan 1 1989 texas was 
second with 200000 head an 18 percent increase 
overall the us inventory of sheep and lambs was about 114 
million head on jan 1 up 5 percent from a year earlier 
this increase in sheep and lamb inventory implies a 
substantial corresponding rise in lamb and mutton production in 
1990 the departments economic research service said 
production for the year is expected to increase about 4 percent 
to 355 million pounds 
meanwhile the american sheep industry association based in 
denver says national lamb month will be in september for the 
second consecutive year instead of april as had been traditional 
it is the time of year when lamb is available to consumers at 
the best value per pound said the associations robin ganse 
promotional efforts can give consumers that extra push in 
deciding to serve lamb for holiday meals

the navy should respond to the diminishing 
soviet threat by shifting much of its fleet to reserve status 
according to a former navy secretary 
john lehman a proponent of the 600ship navy during his tenure 
in the reagan administration said the pentagon no longer needs to 
operate as if the nation is in a wartime mode 
regardless of the size of the soviet fleet theyre not about 
to attack tomorrow or the next day or the next year lehman 
told the house armed services committees defense policy panel 
tuesday 
however lehman said the size of the navy is not affected by the 
rapid push toward democracy in eastern europe 
determining the number of ships in the fleet are the five 
oceanic regions where the united states has vital concerns and the 
continued modernization of the soviet fleet including production 
of submarines 
the former secretary said the navy should alter its approach 
shifting ships and aircraft to the reserves with half active 
forces and half reserves manning the ships and squadrons 
he suggested shifting half the 20000 sailors associated with 
ships near europe to reserve status but did not provide additional 
specifics 
pressed by lawmakers about the future us naval fleet if it 
shrinks to 400 ships lehman said the pentagon should keep at least 
14 carriers and four battleships 
in the fiscal 1991 defense budget defense secretary dick cheney 
has proposed mothballing two of the four us battleships the uss 
iowa and the uss new jersey 
retired air force gen russell e dougherty former commander of 
the strategic air command agreed with lehman that the likelihood 
of confrontation was slim 
the tinderbox character in europe is changed maybe even 
gone and the changed political situation in the warsaw pact and 
eastern european has dramatically changed the confrontation 
dougherty told the committee 
but both lehman and dougherty stressed the need for development 
of the b2 stealth bomber its cost of more than 70 billion for 
132 planes has drew criticism in congress 
keeping the longrange bomber leg makes eminent sense 
lehman said 
but he questioned continued spending on landbased nuclear 
missiles to make them survivable in the event of a soviet attack 
bush administration plans calls for moving the multiplewarhead mx 
missile from hardened silos to railroad cars and developing the 
smaller midgetman missile 
throwing more money after the landbased leg of the icbm is 
really on the wrong end of the ledger of business said lehman 
managing director of paine webber inc the amount of money that 
you have to spend to make icbm survivable in this kind of 
environment just doesnt make any sense to me 
questioned further about his position on landbased missiles 
lehman said he favored keeping the mx missile but that officials 
should accept the fact its vulnerable to a first strike

the government is revoking the flying license 
of the pilot who skidded his usair jetliner into new yorks east 
river last year 
saying capt michael martin lacked the care skill judgment 
and responsibility to fly a commercial airliner the federal 
aviation administration announced the revocation tuesday and gave 
martin 20 days to appeal to the national transportation safety 
board 
in another new york crash the ntsb on tuesday released a 
cockpit voice recorder transcript that showed the copilot of 
avianca flight 52 told the pilot he had radioed a fuel emergency 
but he used less precise language with ground controllers 
the avianca jet which apparently ran out of fuel crashed jan 
25 at cove neck long island killing 73 of the 159 people aboard 
including all three cockpit crew members 
in the usair case air line pilots association spokesman john 
mazor said his group considers the action against martin totally 
unwarranted and it will be appealed 
two people died in the sept 20 aborted takeoff and 61 others 
were rescued from the airliner which broke into pieces at the end 
of a laguardia airport runway 
the faa cited martins failure to fully complete a pretakeoff 
checklist and perform other required actions on the taxiway 
the agency earlier ordered alteration of cockpit controls in all 
boeing 737 airliners as a result of the crash the pilots union 
said the faulty design of controls led to the aborted takeoff and 
the ntsb has been looking into that as one of several possible 
causes for the crash 
the revocation order dated march 19 but announced tuesday 
faulted the pilot for failing to check a rudder control or monitor 
engine thrust which it said caused the airliner to drift to the 
left 
an faa news release did not mention either martin or copilot 
constantine kleissas by name and said nothing about the copilots 
status 
the faa earlier suspended the licenses of both martin and 
kleissas who was at the controls of a commercial boeing 737 
takeoff for the first time 
the avianca cockpit transcript said the colombian pilot said 
tell them we are in emergency in spanish just after the plane 
failed its first landing attempt and 10 minutes before it crashed 
were running out of fuel the copilot told controllers in 
english at 924 pm after the crew of the boeing 707 was 
instructed to abort the attempted landing at john f kennedy 
airport and loop around for another try 
a few seconds later the pilot again asked the copilot to tell 
the controller there was an emergency digale que estamos en 
emergencia the pilot said also asking whether his order had 
been carried out 
si senor ya le dije said the copilot yes sir i 
already advised him according to the transcript and translation 
released by the ntsb 
none of the cockpit crew members was identified by name in the 
transcript the flight had come from bogota and medellin 
a source close to the investigation told the associated press in 
new york on monday that the transcript appeared to show a pilot who 
did not seem to be in full charge of the flight and who did not 
give specific direction to the copilot to declare an emergency

top pentagon officials are trying to persuade 
defense secretary dick cheney that the military still needs some of 
its most expensive aircraft programs including the b2 stealth 
bomber despite revolutionary changes in the soviet bloc 
defense sources said cheney planned today to begin viewing a 
slide presentation of the results of a program review that the 
secretary had requested in december to help him formulate longterm 
budget plans 
the review looked into the expensive b2 program the c17 cargo 
plane and two fighter aircraft still under development the air 
forces advanced tactical fighter and the navys a12 overall the 
programs account for some 200 billion in projected pentagon 
spending 
cheney is preparing the pentagons fiveyear defense plan in the 
face of severe pressure on capitol hill for military spending cuts 
to cut the budget deficit and respond to the political change that 
has swept eastern europe and the soviet union 
but so far cheney has advised against severe cutbacks in the 
us arsenal he contends that despite some reforms the soviet 
union retains enormous military might that could pose a threat to 
this country 
while the review had initially been touted as one could entail 
calls for canceling some of the programs no such stark 
recommendation is made pentagon sources said tuesday 
although the review reaffirms the military requirements for the 
new aircraft it also lays out various options for trimming the 
numbers of planes or drawing production schedules out in light of 
tight budgets said the sources who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
a particular target for cuts is the radarevading b2 bomber 
said one pentagon source familiar with the outlines of the review 
the b2 numbers are in trouble the source said the air 
force has requested some 132 stealth bombers costing more than 
500 million each 
the bomber program has been the focus of fierce opposition on 
capitol hill where some lawmakers are pressing for the programs 
termination 
the three other programs receive more favorable treatment in the 
review the source said and the a12 and the c17 are considered 
to be in pretty good shape 
the review provides cheney with ranges of options to choose 
from the source said its more of a philosophical 
presentation he said 
pentagon spokesman bob hall said cheney is going to advise 
congress of any decisions that stem from this review any 
important recommendations he will want to make any conclusions he 
will draw from it im sure hell discuss with the president 
congress will get the results in the near future weeks i 
think hall added 
last week john betti the undersecretary of defense for 
acquisition said the studies had involved dozens of pentagon 
officials and that they planned to present cheney with a menu of 
options 
betti who helped organize the review said it had involved 
going back to ground zero on the need for the aircraft during a 
period of strained resources 
cheney will have to decide what will be done hell have to 
establish priorities and the way he intends to sell them to the 
president and the congress betti said

opponents of capital punishment are 
trying to overcome the large majority opinion in favor of it as the 
states first execution in 23 years approaches 
at 3 am on april 3 unless lastditch appeals succeed 
37yearold robert alton harris will be strapped into san quentins 
49squarefoot applegreen gas chamber and an invisible cloud of 
cyanide gas will end his life 
should we as a society use the same language as the murderer 
the language of death and create new victims society must rise 
above the level of the murderer said jim young who has been on 
a protest vigil outside the prison for three weeks 
young a member of death penalty focus sat on monday by a black 
cardboard coffin and signs reading dont kill for me and the 
death penalty is dead wrong two other people one the wife of 
another death row inmate stood nearby 
also on hand were a man and a woman carrying signs applauding 
the scheduled execution and urging people to remember his victims 
harris was found guilty and sentenced to die for the july 5 
1978 murders of san diego 16yearolds john mayeski and michael 
baker after abducting them to use their car in a bank robbery 
we know were up against a hard rock of public opinion 
young said referring to some statewide public opinion surveys 
showing 80 percent of californians in favor of capital punishment 
but people say theyre for the death penalty because its 
been sold to them said young thats why were out here at the 
gate to give out information 
members of other groups opposed to capital punishment and 
fearful that harris death will lead to further executions also 
have been fasting speaking out or writing to gov george 
deukmejian to ask for clemency 
although opponents argue capital punishment is immoral and fails 
to deter crime the head of a sacramentobased national victims 
rights group sees things differently 
we believe that ultimately the death penalty simply 
incapacitates murderers more effectively than any other form of 
punishment contemplated or legal in the united states said 
michael rushford president of the criminal justice legal 
foundation harris will never kill again 
death penalty foes argue california has no need for the death 
penalty to prevent murderers from being released to kill again 
we can effectively deal with the problem with the current law 
life without possibility of parole said stephen souza the 
regional membership coordinator of amnesty international 
still proponents are skeptical that such a punishment can be 
counted on with any certainty 
they dont have any idea what that is about said steve 
baker the father of one of harris young victims and a san diego 
police detective baker will witness harris execution 
the american civil liberties union argues that the death penalty 
is inherently a form of cruel and unusual punishment and therefore 
unconstitutional 
errors cannot be corrected after someone is dead once theyre 
dead theres no appeal said martha kegel the aclus associate 
director in northern california

truckers would be banned from hauling loads of 
food and garbage back to back under legislation the house passed 
overwhelmingly over bush administration opposition 
the bill approved 41015 on tuesday directs the department of 
transportation to issue regulations banning refrigerated trucks 
tank trucks and rail cars from alternating loads of food with 
shipments of unacceptable nonfood products such as solid waste 
or chemicals 
backhauling is dangerous disgusting and legal rep william 
clinger rpa one of the measures prime sponsors said before 
the vote we have not eliminated this practice by publicity 
which makes it terribly important that we pass this bill 
the administration opposed the ban largely because of a 
provision that the transportation department assume enforcement 
responsibility 
alan i roberts a hazardous materials specialist with the 
department told a senate panel three weeks ago that existing law 
is adequate to regulate the handling and transportation of food 
if a bill were approved he said lead responsibility would more 
properly rest with the agencies with food safety expertise the 
agriculture department and the food and drug administration 
the administration has yet to see fit to correct these 
practices rep tom luken dohio said during debate on the 
bill evidently the department of transportation thinks it is the 
problem of the food and drug administration the fda thinks its a 
transportation problem and the epa which has jurisdiction over 
solid waste doesnt know what to think 
the bottom line is that congress is going to have to direct 
these agencies to work together to stop these lifethreatening 
practices luken said 
the legislation would also require that asbestos infectious 
waste and other healththreatening items be shipped only in 
vehicles designated for that purpose 
the bill now moves to the senate where several similar bills 
are pending 
the practice is known as backhauling because it often occurs 
after trucks haul food loads to the east rather than return to the 
midwest empty they carry garbage a trucker testified last august 
that he liked hauling garbage because it could not be harmed en 
route 
concern about foodgarbage hauls arose after the centre daily 
times of state college pa reported a year ago that refrigerated 
foodhauling trucks were being loaded with municipal solid waste 
the report led congress to investigate a related practice last 
year alternating hauls of chemicals with shipments of juice or 
edible oils an oregon truckers shipment log released by a house 
panel included loads of cooking oil wine apple juice fire 
retardant marine lubricant and lime sulphur 
several trucking groups have said that concern by food companies 
has pressured truckers into avoiding the practice the government 
says it has yet to uncover any instances of contamination due to 
backhauling 
but clinger and rep chris smith rnj said that checks by 
their staffs have confirmed that backhauling is continuing

the energy department is giving up 
responsibility for studying longterm health risks for workers at 
nuclear weapons plants but secretary james d watkins says hell 
increase daily monitoring of the employees 
watkins announced tuesday he has begun negotiations for the 
department of health and human services to take over the longterm 
health studies which seek to answer such questions as whether 
exposure to lowlevel radiation causes increased cancer risks 
the move reflected growing complaints from congress labor 
unions and communities near weapons plants that the energy 
department which owns the facilities cannot be trusted to perform 
objective studies of possible health hazards 
last month the author of a federal study that found a unusually 
high rate of cancers among workers at the rocky flats nuclear 
weapons plant in colorado charged that energy department officials 
had pressured him to water down his findings in 1986 and 1987 
the allegation by gregg wilkinson a former epidemiologist at 
the los alamos national laboratory in new mexico which designs 
nuclear weapons is under investigation by the energy departments 
inspector general 
watkins decision was prompted by a panel of health physics 
experts which said in a report released tuesday that the 
department should monitor workers health but should cede 
responsibility to another federal agency for studying longterm 
health issues 
the panel headed by kristine gebbie the secretary of health 
for the state of washington said the public does not trust the 
energy department to do its own studies 
because the departments role is to promote energy production 
there is an inherent potential conflict between immediate 
production goals and health and safety goals the report said 
to restore public trust to assure the highest scientific 
quality and to assure the independence of investigators the 
department needs an independent system it added 
the panel also recommended that the energy department spend more 
time studying health risks from worker exposure to nonnuclear 
hazards at the weapons plants such as toxic chemicals and 
beryllium which are used in weapons manufacturing 
a recent study said 12 people who were exposed to beryllium 
while working at rocky flats have contracted an incurable lung 
disease they were among 750 employees at the plant who have 
handled beryllium a metal used in making plutonium triggers 
ms gebbie said her panel saw indications that beryllium 
exposure could be a problem at other weapons plants it recommended 
immediate action to study the problem 
watkins said he talked tuesday with hhs secretary louis sullivan 
about switching the longrange epidemiological work to his 
department 
hes ready to go watkins said adding that he hoped the 
energy department could conclude a memorandum of understanding 
with sullivans department within one month on terms of the 
transfer 
watkins initially resisted efforts in congress to take away his 
control over the health studies but in his public meeting with ms 
gebbies panel he said research of this nature is better suited 
for an agency that regularly addresses such issues 
watkins stressed that his department would retain responsibility 
for protecting plant workers health and for minimizing exposure to 
hazardous materials he said he already had taken steps to improve 
daytoday health monitoring 
the secretary also announced that president bush was nominating 
a health physics expert to fill the vacant position of assistant 
energy secretary for environment safety and health which holds 
responsibility for nuclear worker health issues 
the nominee harry pettengill said in a brief interview tuesday 
that he has worked in the departments office of environment 
safety and health for 1 years

two of the leading abortion rights groups 
are split over whether an economic boycott against idaho will 
effectively persuade the governor to veto the countrys most 
restrictive state abortion law 
kate michelman president of the national abortion rights action 
league said tuesday the threat of a boycott on idaho potatoes and 
other products could be counterproductive in the campaign to block 
gov cecil andrus signature on the bill 
i understand the frustration that has led to the idea 
michelman said but i think that threats like that arent always 
the best method its just something that complicates things 
andrus a democrat who opposes abortion under most 
circumstances was deliberating on the bill which prohibits 
abortion as a means of birth control the bill won final 
legislative approval last thursday 
hundreds of telephone calls letters and messages from both 
camps flooded the democratic chief executives office tuesday 
andrus wants to consult outside experts before making his final 
decision 
on tuesday molly yard president of the national organization 
for women said if the bill becomes law she would recommend a 
nationwide boycott of all idaho goods at the organizations 
national conference in june 
it would be similar to the boycott now conducted against states 
refusing to ratify the equal rights amendment in the 1970s 
groups and individuals in states throughout the nation have made 
similar threats prompting state commerce director james hawkins to 
say were becoming concerned 
but antiabortion activists led by the national right to life 
committee have countered with pledges to increase their purchases 
of idaho products 
the legislation bans abortion except in cases of nonstatutory 
rape reported within seven days incest if the victim is younger 
than 18 severe fetal deformity and a threat to the life or 
physical health of the mother 
the governor has until next monday morning to act unless the 
legislature adjourns before then if that happens as is expected 
andrus has 10 days from the time lawmakers leave 
if signed the bill would take effect july 1 but abortion 
rights advocates have promised a court test that antiabortion 
forces hope will convince the us supreme court to overturn its 
1973 decision legalizing abortion 
michelman said shes not interested in hurting the people of 
idaho i think most of the people of the state disagree with what 
the house and senate did 
the most powerful influence on the governor michelman 
maintained will come from his constituents 
im not sure an idaho potato boycott is as effective as real 
wellorganized political grassroots activity she said i think 
the governor will be held accountable by the people of idaho for 
whatever he does and so will the legislators

the transportation department says it will 
consider a recommendation by federal investigators for utilities to 
install a device to help prevent explosions from leaking 
residential natural gas pipes 
the national transportation safety board called tuesday for 
urgent action by dot to require the devices known as excess 
flow valves 
the board said recent fatal accidents in kansas and missouri 
demonstrated the need for the equipment which automatically 
restricts the flow of gas when certain increases occur possibly 
from a leak or rupture in a line 
four people were killed and a dozen injured in a series of five 
explosions between september 1988 and march 1989 on kpl gas service 
lines in the two states 
in a report on the explosions the board concluded that the 
excess flow valves could have prevented or at least reduced the 
seriousness of three of the accidents 
ntsb issued a similar recommendation for the devices in 1981 
but board members said the kpl accidents caused them to renew their 
suggestion and assign it the highest priority for regulatory 
consideration

the sandinistas have agreed to cede 
control of the army and police in a preliminary agreement with 
advisers to presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro on 
transferring power 
the agreement reached late tuesday stresses that the 
demobilization of the contra rebels is crucial if a civilian 
government led by mrs chamorro is to take over from the 
sandinistas on april 25 as scheduled 
dismantling of the rebel force that once had strong us backing 
constitutes an essential element for creating the climate of 
peace stability and tranquility in which the transfer of 
government should take place the agreement says 
the heads of the transition teams signed the preliminary 
agreement after a month of negotiations mrs chamorro defeated 
president daniel ortega in free elections on feb 25 
control of the security forces is a key issue in the transition 
from a decadeold leftist revolutionary government to the 
conservative united national opposition or uno 
under the agreement the sandinista army and police will become 
nonpartisan organizations under the control of mrs chamorro and 
only these institutions should have combat weapons 
the accord also says that the size of nicaraguas armed forces 
which soviet aid built into the largest in central america will be 
determined by the economic capacity and social necessity of the 
nation 
mrs chamorro campaigned on a promise to end the draft and 
drastically cut the size of the military which consumes half the 
national budget in this impoverished country 
the sandinistas openly reluctant to relinquish their armed 
forces and police while the contras remain intact have been 
handing out thousands of weapons since their stunning election loss 
and urging people to defend the conquests of the revolution 
those conquests include thousands of houses and farms 
confiscated by the sandinistas the accord says the new government 
will respect the rights of people who were given confiscated 
property before election day 
the transition document was signed by defense minister humberto 
ortega head of the sandinista transition team and the presidents 
brother and antonio lacayo head of the uno team and a soninlaw 
of mrs chamorro 
lacayo said the agreement forsees the demobilization of the 
contras by april 25 
gen ortega said it was necessary to isolate neutralize and 
put in their right place those who arent on the path of peace and 
democracy that is opening in nicaragua 
he said he was confident that the contras would be dismantled 
once and for all whether they want to be or not 
the contras and uno signed an agreement friday calling for the 
rebels in honduran base camps to disband by april 20 the accord 
says fighters in nicaragua are to move into security zones under 
the supervision of the un force and cardinal miguel obando y 
bravo 
most of the 12000man rebel army is believed to have returned 
to nicaragua in recent months and contra leaders have been vague on 
when the fighters on nicaraguan soil would disarm 
oscar sovalbarro the contra negotiator in the accord with uno 
said monday that 2000 rebel fighters had returned to nicaragua 
since friday alone international observers say the contra camps in 
yamales honduras are like ghost towns 
the contras now confront a unified effort to get them 
dismantled even the united states their longtime sponsor says 
they must disband 
a un observer force began patroling nicaraguan war zones by 
helicopter tuesday and the un security council authorized adding 
800 troops to the 200member demobilization force 
the us ambassador to the united nations james wilkinson told 
the security council in new york that it is time for the rebels 
to demobilize freely and return to their land to contribute to 
its development 
twelve white helicopters emblazoned with the un symbol landed 
at sandinista army installations tuesday morning and two hours 
later took off to the east 
military sources said the aircraft were carrying members of the 
observer force to eastern jungle zones where they would try to 
contact contra chiefs 
the un forces plan to collect weapons ammunition military 
equipment and uniforms from the rebels 
the un plan calls for contras in honduran camps to hand over 
their weapons and await repatriation or resettlement un 
observers also plan to establish temporary assembly points inside 
nicaragua

the tokyo stock exchanges key index fell sharply 
wednesday while the dollar rose against the japanese yen for the 
ninth consecutive day despite government efforts to support the yen 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 56239 points or 177 
percent closing at 3126357 the nikkei fell 1453 points on 
tuesday 
the dollar closed at 15863 yen up 167 yen from tuesdays 
close of 15696 yen it opened at 15830 yen and ranged between 
15815 yen and 15885 yen the dollar now has gained 643 yen in 
nine trading days 
the dollar last traded at the 158yen level in january 1987 
the dollar has been so strong and its rising pace is very 
fast said shinichi kato a trader with mitsui bank 
the dollars advance followed its overnight rise in new york 
kato said a large demand for the dollar prior to yearend 
account settlements is pushing the us currency higher japans 
fiscal year ends on saturday 
importers many of whom are afraid that the dollar will rise 
further jump at the dollar whenever it moves downward he said 
kato blamed the lack of coordinated market intervention among 
central banks for the dollars swift ascent 
the bank of japan alone can no longer control the situation 
he said the dollars upward momentum has become too strong now 
japans central bank was seen intervening in the market by 
selling some 300 million the bank does not officially comment on 
its market intervention 
because the us federal reserve did not sell dollars during the 
previous day japanese market players began to speculate that the 
united states approves of the current dollaryen rate he added 
the dollar will soon hit the 160yen level its just a matter 
of time kato said 
the yens decline knocked the nikkei index more than 650 points 
lower in early trading but the nikkei made up some of its losses 
as market players picked up shipbuilding issues whose prices had 
fallen earlier dealers said 
japanese finance minister ryutaro hashimoto said after a cabinet 
meeting wednesday that he is watching current exchange rate levels 
with great concern kyodo news service reported 
it quoted hashimoto as saying he had received an invitation to 
attend the meeting of the group of seven finance ministers in paris 
in april but that he would decide whether to attend the meeting on 
the basis of the conditions at the time in the japanese parliament

one of the states largest vegetable 
growers told a regulatory board he was opposed to banning the 
pesticide chlordane saying sure its going to kill a lot of 
people but they may be dying of something else anyway 
mcallen mayor othal brand made the statement tuesday during at 
his first appearance at the agriculture resources protection 
authority meeting to which he was appointed by gov bill clements 
brand who is also a grower later denied making the statement 
which was taperecorded by a fort worth startelegram reporter and 
a state employee 
the board was discussing whether to close a loophole in state 
regulations that allows the use of chlordane by homeowners who own 
some of the banned pesticide 
the pesticide is effective in fighting termites 
in the tape brand said im 70 years old and in great shape 
and i mean sure its going to kill a lot of people but they may be 
dying of something else anyway 
texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower called brands 
statement outrageous 
elvin caraway iii a fort worth attorney also appointed to the 
board said brands comment was just an old country expression 
the gist of his comment is there are many things that cause 
illness and that some of the concern about pesticide generally 
is a little overexaggerated caraway said 
im not saying i agree with that or disagree with it

eight years after an auto accident left him 
in a vegetative state a man given a tranquilizer in a dentists 
office fell asleep woke up and started to speak soon he could say 
his name walk and feed himself a doctor says 
dr andres kanner a neurologist with the university of 
wisconsin hospital said tuesday its a mystery why tranquilizers 
awakened the man 
i dont know what it is kanner said it was just luck he 
had to have some dental work and it was just luck they administered 
the drugs 
the patient identified only as a wisconsin man in his mid40s 
had been in a vegetative state not a coma his eyes were open and 
he occasionally uttered words but he could do nothing else the 
doctor said in an interview tuesday 
his interaction with the environment was very limited he 
rarely spoke one or two words kanner said 
the patient had been given valium march 12 as a painkiller for 
routine dental work kanner said after the tranquilizer was 
administered the man fell asleep about five minutes said kanner 
who was not present at the time 
then he woke up and started talking he was able to answer 
questions say his name to feed himself and walk kanner said he 
was told 
hours later the man lapsed back into the vegetative state he 
was given a second dose that brought him out of it for about 90 
minutes at that point he was able to recall parts of his life 
i have to tell you he was a different man he knew his name 
the name of his family where he used to work he could add 
subtract and perform complicated calculations said kanner who 
witnessed the second reaction 
since then the man who remains hospitalized has received 
different longerlasting forms of benzodiazepines a family of 
drugs that includes valium and barbiturates that allowed him to 
remain lucid 10 to 12 hours at a time kanner said the drugs are 
administered intravenously 
doctors cant tell why the drugs helped the man or what 
combination of drugs they can give him to take orally outside the 
hospital he said 
one theory is that benzodiazepines which inhibit certain 
functions of the nervous system are blocking the effects of the 
vegetative state kanner said but doctors for now are viewing the 
mans case as an isolated one he said 
kanner said the man suffers no medical problems other than his 
mysterious vegetative state it developed about two years after he 
came out of a fourmonth coma brought on by a car accident 10 years 
ago 
the neurologist said that as with most such patients little 
was known about how to treat the mans condition and there was 
little hope for recovery before march 12

the only clue for workers answering 
hundreds of calls in spanish at columbia auto parts was the word 
census the callers were trying to reach a special tollfree 
number for questions about the 1990 census friday it was 
amusing said bill carter who runs the business saturday it 
was funny its not even humorous today 
on monday the census bureau sent a spanishspeaking employee to 
the shop to take down telephone numbers and tell callers that 
someone would get back to them the employee took more than 100 
calls dialed to 8002836826 carter said 
joe mcnamara of mci telecommunications corp the longdistance 
carrier for the census theorized that callers held one button down 
too long repeating the 8 in 283 columbia auto parts tollfree 
number is 8002883862 
mcnamara said mci checked the lines and found no problems but 
carter decided to change his number 
i wanted to be able to talk to my receptionist carter said 
i hope the number is ringing somewhere in nevernever land the 
new number is as far away from the old one as i could get it 
in tennessee a medical supply company was experiencing the same 
problem with its number 8002283862 
by late tuesday tricity medical equipment in johnson city 
tenn had recorded 245 calls in spanish that day alone said

a lowcalorie diet can delay cancer 
development and cut cancer risk in mice a researcher reports 
scientists found that the more calories were restricted while 
avoiding malnutrition the more lifespan was extended and the 
longer cancer was delayed said richard weindruch 
i expect the same might apply to the human situation he 
said tuesday at a science writers seminar sponsored by the american 
cancer society 
scientists have long known that mice and rats live longer under 
a longterm lowcalorie diet previous work has also shown 
reductions in cancer rates and delays in the appearance of the 
disease 
caloric restriction has also been shown effective in spiders 
silkworms guppies trout and other animals so this is not 
simply a rodent phenomenon said weindruch of the national 
institute on aging 
in one experiment he described 57 female mice ate a diet of 85 
calories a week from age three weeks while 60 others were put on a 
40calorie diet 
mice eating the lowcalorie diet showed a 35 percent longer 
average lifetime and less than half the risk of tumors the cancers 
they did get appeared at later ages 
a separate experiment found that mice who began a lowcalorie 
diet in midadulthood an age of about a year showed a 10 percent 
to 20 percent gain in maximum and average lifespan weindruch said 
gerald murphy chief medical officer of the cancer society said 
he believed that humans can help lower their cancer risk by 
reducing calories along with moderate reductions in fat 
but too little is known to say whether they will live longer he 
said

poor people migrating in search of food or 
opportunity in the third world are finding that the journey can 
lead to a fate as cruel as poverty itself infection with malaria 
or other severe disease 
the process of development in itself can provoke outbreaks of 
tropical disease says a new world health organization report on 
diseases in tropical regions 
when people move to seek work land and food or to flee wars 
or natural disasters they can become exposed to tropical diseases 
to which they have no resistance and epidemics break out 
declared the report issued this week 
a major example is brazil where the attempt to develop the 
amazon is creating new breeding sites for malariacarrying 
mosquitos it said as a result poor workers farmers 
goldseekers and miners in brazil are suffering a devastating 
increase in malaria as they migrate to the jungle in search of land 
and work 
dr jose najera spanishborn director of whos tropical disease 
control program told a reporter tuesday more than half of the 
malaria cases in the americas are now in brazils amazon region 
he said major increases also have also been recorded in 
afghanistan pakistan sri lanka and indochina the scene of civil 
wars ethnic conflicts and refugee concentrations as well as parts 
of africa 
in contrast india and china have achieved some successes 
against malaria he said thailand which has developed an 
antimosquito net costing about 2 and improved diagnostic and 
treatment facilities reduced annual malaria deaths from 4000 to 
1000 in the past decade 
tropical diseases were once considered diseases of the rural 
poor najera said they still are but now they are also 
closely associated with peoples need to earn income for example 
with the recent massive migration from rural to urban areas and 
with new irrigation and mining projects 
this has prompted who workers to describe sicknesses such as 
malaria diseases of the new frontier of development which rob 
people of their hope of overcoming poverty najera said 
although malaria has been eradicated from areas inhabited by 15 
billion people since the 1950s it remains the most serious 
tropical disease because of its widespread distribution and the 
emergence of mosquitoes resistant to insecticides and of malaria 
parasites to antimalarial drugs the who said 
at a given time an estimated 270 million people are carrying the 
malaria parasite and about 110 million active cases appear a year 
with symptoms of fever shaking chills and drenching sweat najera 
said the annual death toll is 12 million mainly young children 
in tropical africa 
for the first time in history the number of leprosy cases is 
declining the report said with 26 million patients undergoing or 
having completed treatment in contrast to older treatments lasting 
a lifetime the disease can be cured in six months to two years 
through use of three drugs said norwegian tore godal director of 
the joint tropical diseases research and training program of who 
the world bank and the un development program 
other developments 
river blindness or onchocerciasis has declined in west africa 
through control of the blackflies that carry the parasite and 
effectiveness of a new drug 
in uganda simple fly traps costing about 6 each are curbing 
the population of tsetse flies carrier of sleeping sickness or 
african trypanosomiasis control of the insect carrier is also 
reducing chagas disease in brazil 
a drug called praziquantel has helped reduce some of the most 
serious effects of schistosomiasis disease found in much of the 
southern hemisphere such as massive swelling of liver and spleen 
and kidney damage

white racists who use heavy metal music to 
lure youths into the foul fold gangs for every ethnic group 
including samoans these were among the perils being discussed at a 
conference on juvenile delinquency 
some of the issues raised at the 17th national conference on 
juvenile justice which closes today give the impression that 
america is not a great place to raise your kids 
gangs are coming to a community near you ronald stephens 
director of the national school safety center in encino calif 
told the conference on tuesday his center is a project of the us 
justice department and pepperdine university 
the number of gangs are growing stephens said with total 
membership exceeding 100000 in the nations three largest cities 
los angeles has 800 gangs chicago 120 and new york 50 the average 
age of a gang member is 23 
theres a gang for everyone both sexes many ages and every 
ethnic group including samoans stephens said the members are 
violent enterprising and often free of remorse he said 
kids are coming into gangs at an earlier age and staying in a 
longer time he said female activities are growing many are 
mules carrying drugs or weapons 
at the gangs in school breaking up is hard to do seminar a 
los angeles police department videotape showed five teenage girls 
as they fussed with their hair put on eye makeup and giggled in 
front of a bedroom mirror 
then they traveled to a grassy field where the girls began 
pummeling one of their gangster sisters in an initiation ceremony 
a new jersey prosecutor said that skinheads white supremacists 
and neonazis are recruiting young members at rock concerts by 
groups like the klansmen skrewdriver the new storm troopers and 
indecent exposure 
the klansmen have an album entitled fetch the rope 
there is a huge group of children out there learning their 
messages from heavy metal musicians not from teachers not from 
parents said prosecutor alan a rockoff of middlesex county nj 
bias crimes in new jersey have been affected by such communal 
hate groups he said 
the perpetrators of hate crimes do not just attack a human 
being they attack the fabric of society he said 
unfortunately these kids are looking for a sense of belonging 
and the only place they may find it is in gangs or hate 
groups said ernestine gray a juvenile court judge in orleans 
parish la she said the us justice department has documented 
5000 hate crimes directed at minorities in the past decade 
rockoff said as new jersey investigators explore the range of 
hate crimes the common denominator is music that riles the worst 
instincts 
in incident after incident we find the evolution of the 
pollution it is the lyrics that are designed to shock and create a 
triviality out of death destruction he said 
alienated teenagers attracted to the dark symbolism of heavy 
metal music are sucked into a culture of intolerance satanic 
images and anger he said some become ripe for indoctrination by 
groups preaching aryan supremacy that produce a raunchy form of 
music called boot boy rockoff said 
rockoff does not advocate censorship 
we advocate protest boycotting by aware parents and 
professionals why allow these people to make a buck polluting the 
minds of our children rockoff said and secondly exposure 
through exposure you create stigmatization

masked palestinians armed with axes and knives 
killed a 32yearold arab un worker and wounded six of his 
relatives in a west bank refugee camp the army and arab reports 
said today 
arab reports said the slain man identified as yasser kazmous 
had been accused of collaboration with israel in slogans painted on 
walls in the nur shams refugee camp where he lived 
they said more than 50 masked men participated in the raid and 
that they used a blowtorch to break into the family home tuesday 
night 
it was one of the bloodiest attacks involving a suspected 
collaborator in the 27monthold palestinian uprising against 
israeli rule in the occupied west bank and gaza strip 
the army confirmed the death and said police were investigating 
the victims 70yearold father and a brother were reported in 
critical condition and four other family members were also 
hospitalized with stabbing and beating wounds arab hospital 
officials said 
kazmous was the 200th palestinian killed by fellow arabs since 
the uprising against israeli occupation began in december 1987 
most were suspected of collaboration with israel or of dealing in 
drugs or prostitution 
a total of 669 palestinians have been killed by israelis in the 
27monthold conflict and 43 israelis have died 
officials at the un relief and works agency which oversees 
refugee aid programs said kazmous was the agencys service officer 
in the nur shams camp and was responsible for supervising camp 
activities and processing applications for un aid 
the army spokesmans office said a curfew had been clamped on 
the camp this morning nur shams near the west bank town of 
tulkarem is home to about 5000 palestinians 
the un officials who asked not to be identified by name said 
the attack on the kazmous family was the second incident involving 
a un worker 
last fall a un teacher accused of collaborating escaped from 
an armed palestinian gang in a refugee camp near jericho by 
throwing a grenade at his attackers 
also today israeli security agents used explosives to blow down 
the doors of two houses in the jerusalem village of jebel mukabar 
and make arrests

the shkirats are brothers of the late ahmad mishal shkirat he 
died of burns last may 4 four days after the car he was driving

oscar who 
hollywoods annual award gala drew its glitzy band of movie 
stars directors and producers but failed to lure a boffo tv 
audience registering its weakest ratings in three years 
preliminary ratings figures released tuesday by abc showed the 
62nd academy awards scored a 279 rating meaning it was viewed in 
less than 26 million us homes 
the figures indicate that 48 percent of all television sets in 
use were tuned to the show according the ac nielsen co 
estimates 
last years oscars show which featured a chancy duet between 
rob lowe and snow white was seen in nearly 27 million homes the 
1988 telecast also was more popular than mondays edition 
the broadcast was marred by an annoying sound glitch during a 
satellite feed from moscow and was characterized by several 
onscreen comments critical of nomination omissions 
television critics were mostly kind in their reviews of the 
show although some said it was too long and too conventional 
the broadcast ran 3 hours 34 minutes 
overseas segments also were shown from england japan australia 
and argentina designed to show the film industrys global 
influence 
it was the longest show since the 1984 program which ran 3 
hours 42 minutes

a federal judge has ruled that 
confidentiality agreements between reporters and sources must be 
explicit for courts to side with sources when they allege such 
pacts are broken 
us district judge harry maclaughlin on tuesday dismissed a 
lawsuit by a minneapolis woman who complained that glamour magazine 
went too far in identifying her in a story about sexual 
exploitation by therapists 
maclaughlin said the womans agreement with writer claudia 
dreifus was too ambiguous to be enforced 
the woman agreed to provide the magazine details of the sexual 
abuse she suffered during psychiatric therapy in 1979 and 1980 but 
she had asked not to be identified or identifiable in the story 
even though the september 1988 article gave the woman a 
fictitious last name it went on to describe her as a minneapolis 
lawyer and gave specifics about her activism on issues involving 
sexual abuse of patients by therapists 
the woman sued dreifus and conde nast publishing inc for breach 
of contract 
the court has no doubt that in balancing the rights of the 
free press with common contractual rights the free press rights 
under the first amendment must be given preference maclaughlin 
said 
dreifus had testified that the woman wanted some kind of 
masking but was very casual about it 
the judge said dreifus honored the womans only specific 
masking request by not describing problems she had at one of 
her previous jobs 
the woman knows only two people who identified her from the 
article and they had been therapists for her the judge said 
the article portrayed the woman as someone who successfully 
recovered from an exploitative situation maclaughlin wrote 
the chilling effect resulting from the possibility of 
protracted litigation and large damage awards recognized by the 
supreme court in defamation actions is also present in an action 
for breach of a reportersource agreement maclaughlin wrote 
to enforce reportersource agreements in litigation plaintiffs 
at a minimum must prove specific unambiguous terms and to 
provide clear and convincing proof that the agreement was 
breached maclaughlin wrote 
elliot rothenberg the womans attorney said he is discussing 
with his client the possibility of an appeal 
newspapers and media must abide by the agreements they 
willingly enter into and the first amendment does not absolve those 
obligations he said 
rothenberg said that if he filed an appeal he would invoke the 
case of dan cohen a twin cities public relations agent who won a 
breach of contract lawsuit against the star tribune and the st 
paul pioneer press dispatch which has since changed its name to 
saint paul pioneer press 
the newspapers named cohen as the person who leaked court 
documents in 1982 showing that a candidate for lieutenant governor 
had been convicted of shoplifting reporters promised cohen 
confidentiality but newspaper editors decided to name him because 
they believed the public had a right to know he worked for a rival 
gubernatorial candidate

the city that inspired the film 
american grafitti moved to shed its reputation as the cruising 
capital with a pair of ordinances trying to put the brakes on the 
pastime 
the city council unanimously approved the two rules tuesday 
night after listening to testimony that ran nearly 31 against the 
proposals 
teenagers most of whom were born after the release of the 1973 
film directed by george lucas a modesto native said they cruise 
popular mchenry avenue in this central california city for the same 
reasons as their parents to show off their cars and meet dates 
im 17 years old and ive waited all my life to cruise said 
billy moorehead you cant get rid of us were going to stay 
under the ordinances motorists passing specific checkpoints 
more than once in a fourhour period would face fines ranging from 
75 to 250 
pedestrians who routinely gather on sidewalks and in parking 
lots along the strip would risk equal fines for loitering between 
6 pm and 6 am 
the ordinances which require a second reading before becoming 
law would be enforced only when traffic moved at less than 5 mph 
my personal opinion is that moderate cruising will still exist 
along mchenry said police chief gerald mckinsey 
the police department which drafted the proposals claims 
patrol officers cant reach trouble spots when cars clog the avenue 
many weekend nights 
more than half of all assaults along mchenry avenue and 78 
percent of all drug arrests are made during the peak cruising 
hours mckinsey said 
supporters of the rules contend that the pastime popularized in 
the 1950s is no longer goodnatured when influenced by 1990s 
problems such as vandalism and drugs they would rather it join 
sock hops as an object of nostalgia 
the vandalism drinking drugs and prostitutes filter into our 
street and yards every weekend night said terry mccloskey 
many of us feel like prisoners in our own homes on weekend nights 
because were afraid of what will happen to our property 
business owners taking up the anticruising side say they lose 
customers when the daily commuter corridor transforms into a 
cruising strip 
cruising has affected the quality of life on mchenry and for 
residents in a negative way said kyle barker a music store 
owner who organized the mchenry avenue merchants association 
modesto i dont think wants to be known as the cruising mecca 
of the world

the union for daily news reporters voted to 
authorize a strike after being offered a proposal that would cut 
benefits and extend the work week while increasing wages 
the members of local 3 of the newspaper guild voted 267 to 19 
tuesday to authorize their leaders to call a strike 
hopefully this will let them know that the people who work at 
the news werent thrilled with the contract proposal said larry 
sutton a reporter and member of the guild negotiating committee 
the news has said it will advertise for replacement workers for 
any union that authorizes a strike and said tuesday it would do so 
for the guild workers on monday 2000 people responded to ads for 
mailers jobs 
the union leaders kneejerk rejection of a 30 percent wage 
increase is a grave disservice to their members said john t 
sloan the news vice president for human resources 
the guild and nine other unions at the news are negotiating for 
new contracts the old ones expire at midnight friday but all 
sides expect to continue talking beyond then 
management and the unions consider these talks the most 
important in the history of the tabloid which has antiquated 
printing equipment and which management says is losing money 
the news offered the reporters raises of 10 percent for each of 
three years at the proposed contracts end journalists with six 
years experience would be earning 1343 a week higher than those 
earned now by any unionized reporters in the country 
but union leaders complain that other provisions in the proposed 
contract will eliminate severance pay and cut back the health and 
pension plan 
union leaders said the proposed contract extends the work week

a star wars medical mentality has 
bolstered the use of lasers to unclog blocked arteries but other 
methods appear to be more effective and less costly radiologists 
said 
doctors meeting here tuesday for the society of cardiovascular 
and intervention radiology conference also said studies show the 
laser method increases the chances of patient complications 
the radiologists issued the caution after surveying the 1300 
members attending 
several papers were submitted comparing lasers to the more 
common balloon angioplasty in which plastic balloons are pushed 
through an artery to clear obstruction 
the papers showed lasers actually have results that are 
somewhat poorer than the balloons when used in partially clogged 
arteries said dr arina van breda an associate professor of 
radiology at george washington university in washington 
lasers should not be considered to have any proven efficacy 
said van breda program director for the society they should be 
considered experimental and patients should be forewarned 
the doctors said there are some situations in which lasers 
should be used chiefly when the blood vessel is completely 
blocked preventing the insertion of a balloon but they said 
lasers should be used only for backup not as a primary treatment 
van breda said patients are attracted by the idea of lasers 
which sound more advanced than balloon angioplasty 
people think that since they are hightech very expensive and 
very sexy they must work its kind of a star wars medical 
mentality she said 
dr daniel choy who heads the st lukesroosevelt hospital 
center laser laboratory at columbia university in new york said he 
did not totally disagree with the findings 
certainly laser angioplasty is still experimental choy 
said but i dont think lasers by any means are dead they are 
being constantly improved 
he said lasers must improve their reclosure rate if they are to 
ever supplant or even complement balloon angioplasty and said new 
techniques including the use of smart lasers which can make 
application more specific aimed to do just that 
dr robert hewes of the kettering medical center in ohio said 
his studies showed laseropened blood vessels could have been 
wiened by simpler less costly balloon angioplasty and at only 
about a third of the cost 
in addition lasers require an operating room and general 
anesthesia raising costs and the odds of complications he said 
also the hottipped laser itself can actually damage the vessel 
lining which can cause it to close again he said 
hewes and his associate dr ted miller compared 42 laser 
angioplasties by vascular surgeons with 32 balloon angioplasties by 
interventional radiologists during the same period 
the laser cases had a 19 percent complication rate compared to 
3 percent for radiologists and they showed a 50 percent success 
rate vs 94 percent for the balloon procedure

notice of the fire code violations which also included an 
illegally addedon second floor no second exit and no fire alarms

dilorenzo leased the building to jay weiss husband of actress 
kathleen turner who in turn leased the building to club manager 
elias colon colon was among the 87 people who died in the fire 
sunday 
normally the violations report would have been forwarded by the 
owner to the leaseholder but weiss attorneys said they never 
received a formal notice of the violations they would not comment 
on whether they knew of them 
prosecutors are looking into whether the buildings landlords or 
owners might bear responsibility for the fire police alleged it 
was set by julio gonzalez in a jealous rage against his 
exgirlfriend who worked at the club 
the club was incorporated in 1988 as a notforprofit 
corporation for the purpose of providing for members 
entertainment sport recreation and amusement of all kinds the 
times reported 
the incorporation papers appeared to enable colon to avoid 
filing state and city income tax forms the times said 
weiss had been trying to evict the happy land social club for 
nonpayment of rent since september according to weiss lawyer 
roger boyle 
a lease signed by happy land on oct 7 1987 called for monthly 
rents of 1500 for the first year 1650 for the second and 
1950 for the third 
court papers concerning the rent squabble show that on feb 15 
1989 a process server stuck a notice on the door of happy land

improvements to the premises with the approval and consent of the 
petitioner 
the case was to have been tried today

a museum planning to exhibit sexually explicit 
photographs by the late robert mapplethorpe has taken the unusual 
step of asking a court to decide whether they violate local 
obscenity laws 
the private contemporary arts center hopes to forestall the 
sheriffs threat to file obscenity charges against the museum when 
it opens the sixweek exhibit april 6 
sheriff simon leis a veteran antismut campaigner has called 
some of the pictures criminally obscene and said he will take 
action against the exhibit if police do not 
nine of the 175 photographs in the show depict homosexual 
activity and sadomasochistic sex acts the pictures led congress 
last year to limit federal support for the arts after sen jesse 
helms rnc labeled them obscene 
the museum tuesday filed a petition for a jury trial in 
municipal court a trial date was not immediately set museum 
officials said they expected a ruling before the exhibit opens 
it may be unorthodox for the person displaying the material to 
initiate this action but in this case it is the commonsense thing 
to do said marc mezibov a lawyer for the museum 
the show is an attempt to broaden artistic horizons in a city 
that has closed every adult bookstore and prosecuted publisher 
larry flynt for distributing hustler magazine museum officials 
said 
i think there are people in the community who are a little 
embarrassed about the communitys tendency to cave in to 
censorship said jack sawyer curator at the center 
chad wick resigned last week as the chairman of the board of the 
contemporary arts center saying opponents of the exhibit were 
exerting heavy pressure on his employer the central trust co 
last summer the private corcoran gallery in washington canceled 
an exhibit of the mapplethorpe photos but they were later shown at 
the washington project for the arts and appeared without incident 
in philadelphia chicago boston hartford conn and berkeley 
calif 
the city of cincinnati police department has jurisdiction if 
the pictures are exhibited downtown but if they fail to do what 
should be done i will do it myself said leis 
leis then county prosecutor prosecuted flynt in 1977 on 
charges of pandering obscenity flynt was convicted but an appeals 
court in 1979 ordered a new trial a new prosecutor dropped the 
charges in 1985 
the museum director dennis barrie arranged for the exhibit 
after seeing mapplethorpes photographs in new york city in 1988 
before they sparked controversy in congress 
i thought it was absolutely the most stunning photographic 
show id seen in years barrie said there was no doubt in my 
mind that for this community and even for any community some of the 
work would be controversial especially the work that dealt with 
his homosexual lifestyle but on the whole the show was so 
overwhelmingly beautiful 
the exhibit of mapplethorpes works also include pictures of 
marble sculpture dramatically lighted flowers and portraits of 
bodybuilder lisa lyons and artists andy warhol and laurie anderson 
mapplethorpe died of aids in march 1989 
because of the uproar over the corcoran gallery exhibit 
congress approved a 1990 appropriation to the national endowment 
for the arts that forbids support of homoerotic or sadomasochistic 
art or depictions of sex acts 
the contemporary arts center is using no government money on the 
50000 exhibition it will rely on ticket sales and a 10000 
grant from a local video production company barrie said 
barrie said the museum will put sexually explicit photographs in 
a separate gallery with a prominently displayed warning people 
under age 18 will not be admitted without an adult

rival zulu factions armed with 
guns and knives waged bloody battles and set homes ablaze in natal 
province today while hundreds of soldiers and police moved in to 
halt their fullscale war 
terrified residents in black townships near the southeastern 
city of pietermaritzburg abandoned their homes and fled into the 
countryside residents said 
it almost looks as though the whole area is burning police 
maj piet kitching said 
army units were deployed around edendale near pietermaritzburg 
after 2000 zulus supporting the inkatha party attacked supporters 
of the rival united democratic front police said patrols used 
shotguns and tear gas to disperse mobs attacking and burning houses 
police reported widespread clashes in the area since tuesday 
with at least two people dead and about 25 wounded in the fighting 
but local reporters who did not want to be named said up to 14 
people had been killed and scores of houses set on fire in 
townships around edendale in natal province 
tens of thousands of people were unable to go to work when the 
bus service shut down because of attacks and the milling crowds 
added to the tension 
things are completely out of control it looks terrible there 
were 2000 people fighting it out with guns and other weapons 
said a journalist reached by phone 
its a bloody war out there a medical worker said 
peter kerchhoff of a pietermaritzburg peace group said dirt 
roads leading to townships were blockaded with tree tunks 
boulders and burning tires people were fleeing with pieces of 
furniture and houses were burning in several townships as his 
group drove through the crowds taking four injured to the hospital 
kerchhoff said people were saying please we need guns 
there are reports of a fullscale war thousands of people are 
moving up to defend an area and thousands are moving down to 
attack said radley keys a community worker 
zulus went on the rampage in the area after opponents stoned 
buses and other vehicles returning sunday from a zulu rally police 
said police said zulus hijacked buses to truck in hundreds of 
armed youths for the fighting 
hundreds of people have been killed in black factional fighting 
in recent weeks in natal the zulu tribes inkatha movement is 
fighting the udf for control of the region 
both groups are antiapartheid but inkatha supports separate 
states for different tribes or ethnic groups the udf wants a black 
majority government ruling all of south africa 
several local leaders charged police were aiding inkatha 
fighters giving them ammunition and helping them attack rival udf 
fighters the leaders were appealing to government officials to 
force police to act impartially 
pierre cronje a white member of parliament of the opposition 
democratic party said he was furious because police were merely 
scolding armed inkatha men instead of trying to confiscate 
their weapons and disperse them 
police commanders had no immediate response to the charges 
residents said hundreds of troops were seen near edendale 
an army spokesman col john rolt said troops had been sent to 
the area to aid police but gave no further details 
efforts by nelson mandela and other black leaders to end the 
fighting have failed despite extensive appeals for peace 
in other developments president fw de klerk said in 
parliament in cape town on tuesday night that a date could not be 
set for ending apartheid laws he said the government wanted to 
move as quickly as possible but the issue was linked to pending 
talks on ending whiteminority rule 
the government is to meet with the african national congress 
april 11 to try to clear the way for talks on sharing political 
power with blacks

a prestigious soviet newspaper today criticized 
hungarys state airline for suspending flights of soviet jews to 
israel last week calling the decision capitulation to 
international terrorism 
i see it as my duty to decisively condemn such an action 
political commentator igor belyayev said in the weekly 
literaturnaya gazeta 
it was the first known soviet condemnation of the decision by 
the carrier malev to suspend service to tel aviv after a threat 
from islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine an arab 
extremist group 
the article did not however mention the position taken by the 
soviet national airline aeroflot which has stopped selling tickets 
for soviet jewish emigres traveling to hungary 
belyayev said there appeared to be a genuine threat to malev 
passengers security but added reconciliation with the islamic 
jihads provocation amounts to indecisiveness in the fight against 
international terrorism 
up to 750000 jews are expected to emigrate to israel in the 
next few years as the result of relaxed rules in the soviet union 
and tighter entry quotas in the united states 
the expected influx has angered arab leaders who fear 
palestinians will be displaced by the new arrivals 
a kuwaiti newspaper today quoted a senior adviser to soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev as saying that arabs are 
exaggerating the issue of soviet jewish emigration to israel 
georgy arbatov a member of the central committee and director 
of the united states and canada institute also predicted in an 
interview with alwatan that the number of soviet jews going to 
israel will be on the retreat 
in leningrad 13 jews held a demonstration and a hunger strike 
at the hungarian consulate demanding immediate transportation or 
compensation for those who had malev tickets as well as a public 
apology said abraham demin an activist who participated in the 
protest tuesday 
hungarian officials later pledged rapid transportation of the 
emigres who have bought malev tickets and said they would be taken 
by trains buses or aeroflot planes he said 
hungarian minister of state imre pozsgay has said malev is 
independent of the partystate and that the government hoped it 
would reconsider its decision and resume flights to israel 
on tuesday the bush administration expressed disappointment at 
the malev move and urged hungary to reconsider and a group of us 
jewish leaders met with a senior foreign ministry official to 
express concern about the steps taken by aeroflot and malev the 
missions leader said 
marvin lander national chairmanelect of the united jewish 
appeal said representatives of some 140 us jewish leaders 
visiting moscow met with yuri reshetov head of the foreign 
ministrys department of international humanitarian cooperation and 
human rights 
we expressed to him our great concern over response of the 
soviet union and eastern european countries to terrorist threats 
we hope these governments would not cave in lander said 
he said reshetov could not answer questions about aeroflot 
and that soviet officials continue to point the finger at the 
hungarians 
obviously what took place last week is of great concern to 
us lander said this is certainly a roadbock to the emigration 
of thousands and thousands of soviet jews to israel we hope its 
only temporary 
jewish leaders worldwide concerned about rising russian 
nationalism and antisemitism fear a pogrom of soviet jews and are 
urging all measures to expedite their emigration 
polish leaders have said their country is ready to provide 
assistance for the emigrants some jews are flying to israel via 
the romanian capital of bucharest and many others are traveling to 
budapest by train to get on israeli el al planes 
in jerusalem prime minister yitzhak shamir today lashed out at 
arab threats against soviet jews headed for israel and derided 
western leaders as gullible for accepting arab claims of 
moderation toward the jewish state 
let the world open its ears and its eyes to the arab threats 
to blow up planes that carry jewish immigrants shamir said

the foreign minister said today that chineseus 
relations will suffer if president bush imposes trade sanctions on 
china to protest beijings crackdown on prodemocracy demonstrators 
last year 
the minister qian qichen also demanded that fang lizhi a 
dissident living in the us embassy in beijing plead guilty 
to charges of counterrevolutionary activities 
fang a leading astrophysicist and intellectual was granted 
sanctuary at the embassy in june after the military crushed 
prodemocracy student demonstrations killing at least 500 people 
members of congress have called for economic sanctions against 
china because of the continued suppression of political dissent 
following the june crackdown 
qian said that an end to mostfavorednation status for china 
will undoubtedly greatly impair the trade relations between our 
two countries thus causing a major retrogression in our 
relations 
he called on the united states to make a wise decision and 
avoid harming relations 
president bush must inform congress by june 3 whether to renew 
the 1980 agreement granting mostfavorednation status to china 
congress has three months to override his decision 
the united states is chinas third biggest trading partner after 
hong kong and japan the loss of mostfavorednation status would 
result in substantially higher tariffs on chinese imports to the 
united states 
qian said his government will not allow the prodemocracy 
movement sweeping through the soviet union and eastern europe to 
spread to china 
he said china has every reason to guard against reformers 
who are trying to alter its socialist system

prosecutors intend to use a pair of 
gasolinesoaked sneakers and a hunk of dance floor to help make 
their case against a man charged with setting the fire that killed 
87 people in a social club 
a grand jury tuesday began hearing evidence against 36yearold 
julio gonzalez charged with 87 murders in the blaze at the happy 
land social club in the bronx police said he set the fire early 
sunday after being snubbed by an exgirlfriend who worked there 
well have a made case even if he backs out of the 
confession said edward mccarthy spokesman for the bronx 
prosecutors office 
gonzalez was transferred tuesday to a prison unit within the 
psychiatric ward at bellevue hospital where a fellow inmate said 
he raged for hours against his exgirlfriend 
he is so emotionally distraught that tears keep coming down 
the inmate louis cuascut said in todays new york post he 
seems very very depressed 
the happy land club had been ordered closed for fire and safety 
code violations and the landlord was trying to evict the owner for 
nonpayment of rent 
the building that housed the illegal club was subleased to the 
clubs operator by a company coowned by actress kathleen turners 
husband jay weiss he leased it from one of new yorks biggest 
landlords alex dilorenzo iii 
turner said she was shocked by the fire but that her husband 
wasnt to blame 
its unfortunate that it was that building but the fact is 
that you can even throw a firebomb into mcdonalds and it would 
have had the same result turner said outside her manhattan 
apartment the post reported today 
the actress starring in a broadway revival of cat on a hot 
tin roof said she was afraid that people would come to her home 
seeking vengeance 
turner also said tuesday through her publicist this is an act 
of a violent madman its a tragedy it doesnt reflect on me or my 
husband 
among those scheduled to testify against gonzalez are his 
exgirlfriend lydia feliciano a worker at the club and the man 
who sold gonzalez the 1 worth of gasoline he allegedly used to 
start the blaze 
and then we have the container that held the gasoline his 
sneakers which were soaked with gasoline mccarthy said we 
even cut up a hunk of the floor and brought it in to prove the burn 
pattern was caused by gasoline 
district attorney robert johnson said gonzalez gave police a 
videotaped statement in which he admitted that he torched the happy 
land in a pique against ms feliciano 
besides ms feliciano four other people escaped the inferno 
authorities had warned dilorenzo that happy land was riddled 
with violations including an illegally added second floor no 
sprinklers on the first floor no second exit and no fire alarms 
building commissioner charles smith jr said in todays new york 
times 
normally the violations report would have been forwarded by the 
owner to the leaseholder but weiss attorneys said they never 
received a formal notice of the violations they would not comment 
on whether they knew of them 
weiss through his lawyer roger boyle said tuesday that one 
peach associates a company he owns with morris jaffe leased the 
building in 1985 from dilorenzos clarendon place corp 
one peach two years later leased the club to its operator elias 
colon for up to 1950 a month boyle said that since last spring 
the company had been trying to evict colon for not paying rent the 
case was to have been heard in court today colon died in the fire 
one peach also leased space to a second afterhours club called

there were one or two zip codes where the post office had its 
own little mixup no system is absolutely perfect stant said 
ron kern the postal services eastern shore census coordinator

government ministers today for the first time 
faced a public parliamentary grilling on topics ranging from 
chronic food shortages to a foiled scheme to sell tanks abroad 
the appearance of the ministers before the supreme soviet marked 
another step toward making appointed officials subordinate to the 
elected legislature as envisaged in the perestroika program of 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
previously ministers had faced organized questioning only once 
at their confirmation hearings last summer 
most of the heat fell on economic ministers who were asked to 
explain why an economic revival plan adopted three months ago had 
failed to produce tangible results 
vladilen nikitin first deputy chairman of the council of 
ministers said the growth in the rate of food production shrank by 
more than 50 percent between 1988 and 1989 and that the growth of 
processing capacities was running far behind demand 
moving up the introduction of regulated market relations is 
the only way out of a very difficult situation tass quoted him 
as saying 
deputy premier alexandra biryukova who is also a candidate 
member of the politburo was quizzed for 90 minutes about shortages 
of consumer goods 
she said production of consumer goods had increased 6 percent in 
january and february compared with the same period last year but 
she said targets for some types of goods were not reached 
mrs biryukova blamed the shortfalls on instability in the 
country including strikes and work stoppages because of political 
demonstrations 
igor byelousov chief of the soviet militaryindustrial complex 
was then grilled about a foiled scheme to sell a dozen soviet tanks 
to the west 
the plan surfaced in january and involved the ant cooperative 
which acquired the tanks from a factory and was trying to transport 
the sophisticated t72 tanks to an unidentified buyer in europe 
the scheme was uncovered and foiled by the military 
byelousov was asked many loaded questions about the recent 
deal of the ant statecooperative enterprise which tried to export 
tanks illegally tass said the case is being investigated but 
the deputy prime ministers answers did not dispel the deputies 
concern 
the news agency said the deputies wanted to know the 
responsbility not only of lowlevel officials involved but also 
of those in high places who authorized it 
among some 60 observers at the supreme soviet session was sen 
edward m kennedy dmass who was on a visit to the soviet union 
i thought the questions were informed intelligent good 
responses a lively exchange and i think the whole political 
institution is being reexamined kennedy said after the session 
but tass said the first quizzing of ministers fell short of 
expectations some questions were too general while some answers 
were too vague the news agency quoted critics in the legislature 
as saying it said cabinet officers had received about 140 written 
questions from deputies

the military today ordered two 
generals and 19 other officers to stand trial for participating in 
decembers coup attempt against president corazon aquino 
gen renato de villa the military chief of staff issued the 
order after military investigators ruled there was sufficient 
evidence to courtmartial the 21 officers for mutiny murder and 
conduct unbecoming of an officer said army spokesman col juanito 
rimando 
no date was set for the trials but de villa ordered a judge 
advocate gen manuel casaclang to expedite the proceedings 
rimando said 
the december coup attempt was the bloodiest of the six armed 
attempts to topple mrs aquino since she took office in the 1986 
people power uprising against the late ferdinand marcos at 
least 113 people were killed and more than 600 were wounded before 
the fighting ended 
those charged included brig gen marcelo blando and brig gen 
jose commendador 
commendador took over an air base near the central city of cebu 
350 miles southeast of manila it was the last position surrendered 
by the mutineers 
blando led mutinous scout rangers from the central province of 
nueva ecija but surrendered to government forces one day after the 
coup attempt was launched on dec 1

cuba is expected to take additional measures 
against the united states in retaliation for ussponsored 
television programming to the island producing further setbacks to 
the already strained relationship 
after cuban authorities jammed the initial broadcasts of tv 
marti on tuesday the state department expressed regret but said 
transmissions will continue 
broadcasting resumed this morning at 345 am est but cuban 
authorities jammed the signal within three minutes a voice of 
america official said the programming went off the air at 645 am 
the emphasis was on entertainment as testing began tuesday but 
a primary goal of the station is to provide objective news to a 
country that the administration says has received none in 31 years 
the station is a pet project of conservative elements of the 
cuban exile community in florida and cuban officials have told 
us diplomats that exiles may be a target of cuban retaliation 
possible measures include a suspension of air and telephone 
links between the united states and cuba services that exiles 
heavily depend on 
tv marti is modeled after radio marti which some employees fear 
will be the next target of cuban jamming the station has been 
broadcasting relatively free of interference since going on the air 
in 1985 
there also is the possibility that cuba may try to interfere 
with domestic us stations last friday cuba broadcast a radio 
speech by president fidel castro that disrupted stations along the 
florida coast and as far away as nashville tenn 
ariel ricardo spokesman at the cuban diplomatic mission in 
washington left little doubt that additional measures are planned 
beyond jamming 
you never use up all your bullets in the first assault he 
said charging that the station violates international law 
gillian gunn a cuba specialist at the carnegie endowment for 
international peace said the administration should not be 
lulled into believing that cuba wont retaliate more vigorously 
uscuban relations have generally deteriorated in recent 
months and the introduction of tv marti leaves prospects for 
improvement even bleaker 
castro has been warning his countrymen that with the us 
military ouster of panamas gen manuel noriega cuba may be next 
on president bushs agenda he has said that any invading force 
will spill rivers of blood 
in panama the commander of us military forces in latin 
america gen marc cisneros said we dont have the slightest 
intention of invading castro right now there is no need to his 
own people are going to do to him what panamanians did to 
noriega 
defending the selection of programs for the testing debut us 
information agency and voice of america officials said the goal was 
to determine technical feasibility and not to influence cuban 
public opinion 
after a test pattern there was a tape from the 1971 
baltimorepittsburgh world series an old kate and allie 
sitcom mtv videos and a travelogue about new mexico 
the programs stink said frank calzon a cuban exile who is 
a tv marti supporter and washington director of a prodemocracy 
group called freedom house he said the premiere should have 
featured tape on the opening of the berlin wall and on the chilean 
and nicaraguan elections 
jorge mas canosa the chairman of a miamibased organization 
that oversees tv marti had a different reaction he said several 
viewers in cuba had phoned relatives in miami to say they were 
very very enthused extremely satisfied and really excited 
the cuban government issued a statement through the official 
news agency prensa latina saying that tv marti constitutes an 
aggressive action and violates cuban sovereignty 
the tv marti signal was sent from an antenna aboard a balloon 
dangling 10000 feet above cudjoe key off the south florida coast 
technical problems have delayed testing for months 
now that testing has begun the bush administration has three 
months to make a legal and technical evaluation of the operation 
according to the legislation that authorized the station 
state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler said 
international agreements do not prevent a country from engaging in 
television broadcasting to another country she also noted that the 
un universal declaration of human rights entitles all people to 
the freedom to seek receive and impart information and ideas 
through the media

a thimbleful of bugs temporarily 
delayed preparation of the mammoth 15 billion telescope that 
will allow scientists to look deeper into the infinities of space 
than ever before nasa says 
the gnatlike insects called midges were found in a room where 
the hubble space telescope was being readied for installation in 
space shuttle discovery they forced nasa to delay loading the 
telescope until at least thursday 
engineers feared the insects could damage the fragile 
25000pound instrument the most expensive unmanned spacecraft 
ever built 
its kind of ironic something so tiny affecting something so 
big said lisa malone a spokeswoman for the national aeronautics 
and space administration 
as of tuesday evening 37 midges had been sucked into seven 
traps set up in the preparation room 
theyre calling it the body count malone said 
three or so more midges were captured overnight in the 4foot 
cylinders which contain fans and lights that apparently lured the 
insects technicians removed the traps today and began taking a 
special protective bag off the telescope in preparation for 
thursdays installation 
installation originally was planned for tuesday 
it is a super clean payload explained nasa spokesman george 
diller any little particle at all can significantly degrade the 
effectiveness of looking at a very faint object 
the delay in loading the hubble will not affect discoverys 
scheduled april 12 liftoff diller said 
once it begins orbiting 370 miles above earth the hubble will 
be capable of looking seven times more deeply into space and 
detecting objects 50 times fainter than the best groundbased 
observatory 
astronomers will be able to look back almost to the beginning of 
time by studying stars and galaxies so distant that their light has 
been traveling toward earth for 14 billion years 
the shuttle launch may be moved up a day or two since 
technicians have needed little of the contingency time built into 
discoverys prelaunch program even after being bugged by bugs 
mother nature has troubled hubble since the telescope arrived at 
kennedy space center in october crews cannot spray insect 
repellent because of the telescopes extreme sensitivity diller 
said 
in october moths invaded an anteroom used to prepare the 
43foot telescope for transfer into a special clean room then in 
december wasps snuck into the room through a cable conduit 
each time crews kept the telescope from being contaminated 
diller said the telescope is kept inside a special protective bag 
or cocoon that is opened only in order for work to be performed 
the midges were found on the orbiters payload bay doors sunday 
when a servicing machine was retracted to receive the telescope 
the door was vacuumed but some of the insects got inside a payload 
preparation room on the launch tower 
until lately nasa feared a baby greathorned owl in a nest atop 
discoverys launch pad structure might interfere with liftoff 
however the bird has not been spotted in nearly a week 
were on a wildlife refuge and critters are something we have 
to deal with around here diller said like the owls and 
gators sometimes they insects will affect launch operations 
thats part of the business at the cape

two lebanese extremist groups 
today claimed responsibility for the assassination of an american 
missionary who was gunned down by masked men in his home while 
singing prayers with his children 
villagers had accused william robinson 59 of trying to 
establish an israeli settlement in rashaya foukhar in southern 
lebanon 
acquaintances had said robinson who was born and raised in 
athol mass only wanted to expand his 7yearold orphanage for 
handicapped children located in israels selfdeclared security 
zone 
israel denied that any such settlement was planned and sent 
troops to scour the area in search of the killers 
us officials said robinson had been repeatedly warned of 
danger 
three masked assailants broke into robinsons house tuesday 
night while he was singing bedtime prayers with his american wife 
four sons and 26 other children from his orphanage lebanese 
security sources told un investigators 
the assailants then tied up robinsons wife barbara and sent 
the children into another room before shooting robinson three times 
in the neck and chest the sources said the masked men also took 
4000 and some jewelry before fleeing they also killed his guard 
dogs 
in beirut the communist party and the prosyrian lebanese 
national resistance front claimed responsibility for the killing 
one of our units tuesday night carried out the death sentence 
against william robinson who was seeking to establish an israeli 
settlement on lebanese territory a statement from the front 
said the front has carried out several guerrilla raids on israeli 
targets in the area 
the communist party said in its statement that the slaying 
brought an end to schemes to plant jewish settlers in south 
lebanon the party and its militia have carried out numerous 
raids on israeli targets including an abortive suicide truck 
bombing in southern lebanon on april 21 1985 
us embassy officials in tel aviv israel said robinson had 
been repeatedly advised of us government policy barring americans 
from visiting lebanon they gave no hometown citing restrictions 
on privacy 
rashaya foukhar is inside israels security zone in southern 
lebanon about eight miles northeast of israels border the 
sixto10miledeep zone was set up to serve as a buffer against 
raids by guerrillas and is policed by the israelibacked south 
lebanon army 
william f wolford administrator of the international christian 
embassy in jerusalem said robinson was a former us marine from 
just outside chicago who had a love for the children of lebanon 
and went there to help 
he said robinson was a missionary who stayed in lebanon 
because there was no other place to take care of these 20 children 
he was trying to get permission to adopt so he could bring them 
out he was trying to expand the facilities there 
robinsons sister said her brother didnt have any political 
motive for settling in israels security zone 
a lot of the childrens parents had been killed she said in 
a telephone interview from her home in athol he taught them 
right in the home so that there wouldnt be so many children 
killed that was his purpose in going over there 
she said robinson had studied electronics in the marines and 
worked on television cable systems in athol and pittsfield mass 
before moving to california and illinois 
earlier this month 5000 residents of rashaya foukhar 
petitioned the government of president elias hrawi to prevent 
robinson from establishing what they called the first israeli 
settlement on lebanese soil 
the petition said robinson moved to settle in the towns school 
right after israels 1982 invasion and gradually brought in 
relatives and israeli acquaintances 
beirut newspapers have said robinson used trained dogs to keep 
villagers off his fenced compound arousing their suspicion about 
his activities 
but sources in lebanon who asked not to be identified further 
said robinson was engaged in a dispute with shiite moslems over 
land on which he wanted to expand his orphanage 
robinson first entered lebanon from israel in 1978 and worked as 
a technician at a christian tv station in the southern lebanese 
town of marjayoun in 1983 he founded his christian childrens 
home project in rashaya foukhar and was caring for 29 handicapped 
children when he was shot security sources said 
the compound includes a young adults home a childrens home a 
swimming pool a vocational training school a medical center a 
physical therapy center a school a retirement home and an animal 
shelter as well as administration offices and stables

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
march 24 
statesman journal salem ore on the soviet union 
democracy is breaking out in the heartland of the soviet union 
in a way that contradicts the view that voters stick with the 
safety of what they know or that soviet voters are less ready 
than others to run their own lives 
soviet voters know the communist party but large numbers are 
turning to the uncertainties of democratic reform instead 
the speed with which this is progressing is no less a miracle 
than the transformations that have broken upon the nations of 
eastern europe that were once under soviet domination 
the most dramatic change is taking place in the slavic republics 
of russia byelorussia and the ukraine which represent twothirds 
of the nations population 
supporters of democratic reform movements in this key region 
began turning out communist party candidates in runoff elections 
days after the soviet congress legalized a multipleparty system 
 
although it is too early to determine the total implications of 
this voting it would appear that the soviet union itself is firmly 
in the grip of a revolution the peaceful revolution of the ballot 
box appears to be sweeping aside the heirs of the bloody 1917 
bolshevik revolution 
the implications of a pluralistic soviet union that runs from 
the bottom up rather than as it has been from the top down is 
almost too much to grasp for minds honed on this centurys decades 
of hot and cold wars

the wichita kan eagle on the soviet union 
as the baltic states of estonia and latvia line up beside the 
republic of lithuania in acting to end their occupation by soviet 
troops soviet leaders should consider where their nations best 
interests lie 
is it in trying to force the baltics to be a part of the soviet 
union that forcibly and illegally annexed them 50 years ago 
thus leaving a perpetually hostile tier of constituent republics on 
its western border 
or is it in working with the baltics to end the soviet 
occupation as efficiently and quickly as possible and having a 
neutral but potentially friendly tier of independent nations along 
the western border instead 
clearly the soviet unions longterm interests are better 
served by the latter alternative its just as clear that only 
brute force could stop the baltic independence movement now a 
move that would destroy utterly any soviet claims of being a 
changed society

riverside calif pressenterprise on lithuania 
mikhail gorbachev has built up a pretty substantial surplus of 
good will with the west over the last few years now finally in 
lithuania hes having to spend some of those savings 
stepping up military exercises on the lithuanian border will 
cost him some ordering all lithuanians to turn in their guns to 
soviet authorities will cost him parading armored personnel 
carriers through the streets of vilnius will cost him 
events are moving right along on this front and theyre 
following old ruts 
back in january after the lithuanian communist party voted to 
break away from the soviet national party gorbachev became the 
first soviet leader to visit there since the soviets took over in 
1940 he spent three days with political leaders in the streets 
in a factory everywhere he raised the most pragmatic reasons 
against lithuanias secession from the ussr but there were 
nationalist rallies in the squares the process already was under 
way 
at that point gorbachev looking reluctant as could be left 
the impression he might ultimately tolerate it now no one is quite 
so sure that the old rules havent been reinstated 
lithuania may yet rediscover that what it thought to be no leash 
was really just a long one

the news and courier charleston sc on lithuania 
much as mikhail gorbachev would hate to admit it lithuanias 
secession has been a boon to moscow because it helps deflect 
growing unrest elsewhere in the ussr with the abject failure of 
perestroika to resuscitate the soviet economy 
there is nothing like an affront to national honor to take 
peoples minds off empty store shelves it is a tactic that has 
been used successfully throughout soviet history to rally the 
disaffected populace round the kremlin 
as moscow and vilnius jockey for position at the bargaining 
table the silence from washington is deafening 
surely lithuanias bid for independence did not catch the bush 
administration by surprise lithuania president vytautas 
landbergis already has issued a respectful petition to the united 
states and the other democracies for recognition yet president 
george bush so far has failed to respond at least publicly 
no doubt the telephone lines between the white house the 
kremlin and vilnius have seen some heavy traffic recently what was 
said moreover where does president bush stand 
lithuania wants to know we want to know

the hudson dispatch union city nj on poindexterreagan 
there is something truly painful about watching a former 
president act like a petulant teenager with a diary 
and its even worse when a federal judge condones and 
legitimizes such behavior 
us district judge harold greene has ruled that former 
president reagan does not have to produce diary entries he made 
while in office 
the judge is presiding over the irancontra trial of john m 
poindexter reagans former national security adviser facing five 
felony counts 
greene said the three dozen diary entries poindexter wanted 
to use in his defense were not essential 
regardless of the precedent reagans testimony was long overdue 
given the convoluted history of the irancontra inquiry 
central to poindexters defense are his statements that he did 
what he did on reagans behalf 
reagan and the bush administration fought poindexters 
subpoena on the grounds of executive privilege and by arguing that 
personal presidential papers should remain shielded 
rather than fighting to keep his written records of the 
irancontra affair secret reagan should do everything in his power 
to clear up the mystery once and for all

hobbs nm daily newssun on voter registration 
the united states has one of the lowest voter turnouts in its 
democratic elections of any western nation but that dismal 
situation may be about to change 
despite white house opposition the house of representatives has 
approved the so called motor voter bill that reduces barriers 
to voter registration the bill allows voters to register by mail 
at government offices or when they renew their drivers licenses 
this measure also makes it easier to purge those who have died 
or moved and imposes stiffer penalties for threatening voters or 
for voter fraud similar legislation is pending in the senate 
the voter registration bill is in trouble because some 
republicans in congress see increased participation as a threat 
while they complain publicly about potential fraud and cost the 
real fear seems to be that more democrats than gop voters will sign 
up under the loosened rules 
the proposed voter registration bill will do a lot more to 
strengthen citizenship and american democracy than it can possibly 
do to hurt them

san antonio expressnews on polluting the seas 
if you missed the reports that the gulf of mexico is becoming an 
international sewer or doubt the extent of the pollution of the 
worlds open seas two recent studies may persuade you 
a graphic un report says sewage dumped at sea or into the 
seas poses a significant health risk to seafood lovers and swimmers 
who can pick up bacteria and viruses 
and the environmental protection agency or epa issued a report 
that supports a texassought special designation from the 
international maritime organization to strictly limit dumping from 
ships into the gulf of mexico 
the reports make common sense from the first ships that plied 
the seas to the supertankers of today mariners have used the seas 
as their private sewers 
the gulf and coastal areas are worstcase examples of what might 
eventually happen everywhere if international laws arent toughened 
and if polluters arent clobbered for their idiotic and dangerous 
bad habits

replying to mrs thatchers question gorbachev described 
developments in lithuania which have emerged as a result of the 
violation of the soviet constitution the news agency said 
vilnius was calm overnight with no reports of violence or of 
soviet soldiers taking over any more buildings 
lithuanians defied soviet orders to turn over hunting rifles and 
shotguns lithuanian interior ministry spokesman yaroslav 
prokopovich said only about 1000 weapons have been given to 
police but the police were not turning them over to the red army 
authorities estimate there are 30000 weapons in private hands 
police capt jonas dervinis said lithuania has its own 
constitution and we are working to enforce the law of lithuania 
he said he did not know if interior ministry officials from 
moscow would attempt to enforce gorbachevs order a week ago that 
authorities confiscate any weapons not turned in voluntarily in 
seven days 
in moscow the defense ministry issued a statement saying the 
orders issued by gorbachev and the soviet parliament remain in 
effect no one should have any doubt have any doubt that law and 
order will be restored on lithuanian territory 
the statement accused lithuanias government of giving 
lithuanian deserters from the red army separate passports and 
sheltering them from soviet authorities as part of an antiarmy 
propaganda campaign 
the nationalists support illegal anticonstitutional 
activities of the lithuanian government focused on the republics 
secession from the ussr said the military statement from 
moscow reported by newspapers today 
the republics interior ministry organs refuse to take steps 
to detain them and bring them back to their army units it said 
the deserters find shelter in catholic churches hospitals and 
within the grounds of state institutions the statement said 
all attempts by army representatives to resolve the problem 
through a dialogue with the lithuanian government have been 
fruitless 
landsbergis on tuesday condemned the capture of the deserters 
but said the republic will respond with moral strength rather 
than violence 
the government of lithuania demands the return of its 
kidnapped citizens landsbergis said in a letter sent to 
gorbachev 
in a letter to gorbachev landsbergis said the army actions 
likely presaged further violence 
you can see for yourself there is no violence except for 
incidents created by the army he said we can see how they are 
going to great lengths to create the image that in the baltics and 
in lithuania in particular there is instability 
at a news conference tuesday in warsaw poland senior soviet 
diplomats said lithuanias independence drive could lead to 
destabilization of europe and the rest of the world but did not 
elaborate 
a declaration read at the briefing said the aspirations of the 
lithuanian leadership to speedily separate from the other nations 
appear unjustified and lets say frankly dangerous 
in his letter to gorbachev landsbergis said lithuania is an 
unarmed peaceful state and the only way it can resist the 
aggressor is by moral strength and by not using armed resistance to 
violence 
the government of lithuania demands the return of its 
kidnapped citizens he told the soviet president and demanded 
that negotiations with the government of the ussr be held in 
neutral territory 
washington and other foreign governments urged restraint from 
moscow but avoided attacking gorbachev who by fostering greater 
democracy has allowed independence movements to take hold in 
several republics 
gorbachev is also trying to implement marketoriented reforms 
that would nurse a badly crippled economy to health 
tass said soviet soldiers seized 23 lithuanian deserters in the 
predawn raids a lithuanian diplomat in rome today said at least 
38 deserters were seized witnesses said some deserters were beaten 
as they were taken from a psychiatric hospital in vilnius a trail 
of blood led down the steps and out the front door of the hospital 
gorbachev has called lithuanias independence declaration 
invalid and last week ordered lithuanians to turn in their weapons 
and stop signing up with a volunteer militia but the lithuanians 
have not backed down 
the soviet leader had promised not to use force unless lives 
were endangered in the baltic republic which the soviet union 
forcibly annexed along with latvia and estonia in 1940 but 
military authorities had warned they would seize deserters who did 
not return voluntarily by last saturday

the united states illegally discriminates 
against refugees from guatemala haiti and el salvador who have 
reasonable fears for their lives amnesty international charged 
today 
the organization which monitors human rights violations said 
government bias against asylumseekers from particular countries 
appears to be a worldwide pattern 
it said congress however passed a refugee act in 1980 
requiring us officials to use a single standard regardless of the 
applicants nationality ideology or immigration status 
despite this amnesty international said only 25 percent of 
salvadorans and 2 percent of guatemalans and haitians seeking 
asylum between 1983 and 1989 were successful 
the organization said government records show that people of 
other nationalities were granted asylum at a rate of more than 36 
percent 
in a 29page report amnesty international said it had 
communicated its concerns for many years to the state 
department the immigration and naturalization service and other 
officials of the justice department 
no substantiative response has been received to date and 
people with reasonable fears for their lives continue to be denied 
protection the organization said 
a justice department spokesman duke austin commented can it 
be established that the united states is in fact returning people 
to their native homelands and they are subsequently being 
persecuted if that is the case then we are violating the intent 
of the law i dont know of a single case that that has ever been 
established in el salvador or in haiti not one 
randy l levine a new york attorney who was ranking associate 
deputy attorney general from 1986 to 1988 said in my 
experience most of the refugees from guatemala and el salvador 
would not qualify for asylum because they do not have a 
wellfounded fear of persecution most of them are economic 
refugees 
nathan kingsley public affairs officer for the state 
departments bureau of human rights and humanitarian affairs which 
advises the immigration and natural service on asylum matters said 
he had not seen the report 
amnesty international said us authorities have justified 
denial of asylum applications from guatemala on the basis of 
changes in the guatemalan government 
but it said rights abuses in the central american country have 
continued despite the government changes and the number of reported 
cases has increased since 1988 
in fiscal year 1989 only 67 of 3325 guatemalans whose cases 
were decided by district directors of the immigration service were 
granted asylum an approval rate of 19 percent it said the 
overall rate of approval was 14 percent 
the human rights organization said the us policy of using the 
coast guard to interdict haitian refugees frustrates the intent 
of the 1980 refugee act by subjecting this group of people to an 
asylum process conducted at sea which appears to be thoroughly 
inadequate 
it said fewer than 10 of more than 20000 haitians interviewed 
at sea since 1981 have been permitted into the united states to 
claim asylum 
amnesty said the ins denied 13861 applications for asylum from 
salvadorans in 1989 while granting 337

the keene nh sentinel on the cost of sugar 
why one might wonder would anyone spend good money to put an 
ad on tv week after week year after year telling us how cheap 
sugar is 
the answer is that it isnt true 
political action committees affiliated with sugar producers hand 
out about 1 million each election year to sweettoothed 
congressmen on key committees no connection of course but 
congress has imposed very strict quotas on sugar imports the kinds 
of quotas american trade representatives complain loudly about when 
the japanese put them on beef citrus fruit and rice 
according to citizens for a sound economy a freetrade lobby 
americans pay the highest price for sugar of any western nation 
three times the average of what the rest of the world pays a 
department of commerce study shows that sugar quotas cost american 
consumers 3 billion a year 
the quotas also keep the prices of artificial sweeteners and 
other sweeteners such as corn syrup about 2 billion a year higher 
than would otherwise be the case according to a congressional 
research service report and the quotas hurt thirdworld sugar 
producing countries many of which receive us economic aid that 
wouldnt be necessary if they could sell us their sugar

portland maine press herald on censorship of art 
the bush administration did credit to itself last week by 
striking a blow against government censorship 
ignoring the demands of sen jesse helms and other rightwing 
activists the administration told congress it opposed legislation 
to control the content of art supported with federal funds 
fine whether or not the federal government should be 
subsidizing art projects in the first place is open to argument 
but once subsidies are authorized the government ought not to get 
into the business of dictating the specifics of artistic output 
to place restrictions on the content and form of art to be 
supported amounts to government censorship

the providence ri sunday journal on art thievery 
the theft from bostons isabella stewart gardner museum is 
sad indeed we hope the museum will bolster its security to 
protect the master pieces that remain 
art thievery will grow more brazen as long as the market value 
of art escalates but if people could purchase a copy of a painting 
as easily as they can buy a book or a musical recording this crime 
might decline 
we recently viewed copies of paintings by claude monet 
they were painted by computer such copies reproducing even 
the texture of brush strokes are quite expensive but prices could 
decline if consumer demand creates a lucrative market 
this could revolutionize the art world aside from making 
virtual duplicates of art available to hang in the average 
aesthetes living room this process could moderate the value of 
original works

the greenwood miss commonwealth on the broccoli brouhaha 
a reporter in our newsroom the other day asked why all this 
fuss over something as insignificant as broccoli 
the reason we suspect is this broccoli is something every 
american can understand we either like it or we dont like it 
its ugh something we can get our teeth into therefore every 
one of us has an opinion about broccoli we understand it we can 
talk it over and argue about it at the family dinner table 
but consider really weighty problems of the nation like the 
multibilliondollar federal savings and loan bailout that 
financial mess probably is the worst misuse abuse and waste of 
taxpayer money in us history it will cost 200 billion maybe 
300 billion to fix it 
in other countries governments would fall over such a scandal 
congressmen and senators should be voted out of office because of 
it heres a subject taxpayers really ought to be upset about not 
broccoli 
but the fact is the savings and loan controversy is so complex 
it came about because of so many complicated reasons including 
bad judgment by congress the american people dont really 
understand the high cost or know where to place the blame 
its a lot easier and more comforting to argue about broccoli

after learning that he had aids fashion 
designer halston moved to california where he spent some of his 
final days touring the majestic coast around big sur in his new 
jetblack rollsroyce 
the designer who transformed fashion in the 1970s died monday 
night his brother said tuesday that halston had asked that the 
300000 rolls be auctioned off with the funds going to aids 
research 
robert frowick described his brother as intensely private but 
said the family wanted to hold a memorial service that would 
accommodate halstons many fans and friends it will be held friday 
at san franciscos calvary presbyterian church 
the 57yearold designer died at pacific presbyterian medical 
center where he had been hospitalized with kaposis sarcoma since 
december 
we are all deeply saddened by halstons death said ronald 
perelman board chairman of revlon group inc in new york he was 
an american leader of design and style who helped to define his 
entire era he will be sorely missed 
mr blackwell the acerbic fashion designer known for his annual 
worstdressed celebrity list lamented halstons loss 
halston in the last several years has been conspicuously 
absent from the scene his death is a tragedy blackwell said 
from his home in los angeles 
halstons first client was fran allison of kukla fran and 
ollie within months he was creating hats for kim novak hedda 
hopper deborah kerr and shirley booth 
known for his signature black and red attire the ultrasuede 
shirtdress and the pillboxstyle hat worn by jacqueline kennedy at 
the 1961 presidential inauguration halston also designed clothes 
for lauren bacall liza minnelli carol channing and bianca jagger 
he opened his own couture house in 1968 
through his work he collected a starstudded circle of friends 
including artist andy warhol 
born roy halston frowick the son of an accountant and a 
housewife he took to fashion early on at age 13 he made a red 
hat and veil for his mother to wear on easter his brother robert 
said halston always had an innate taste for clothes 
he began working in chicago where he sold hats at the 
ambassador hotel before moving to new york where he joined bergdorf 
goodman in 1957 
halston quickly rose to fashion fame and fortune in the big 
apple earning two prestigious coty awards for fashion 
he was temperamental spoiled always threatening to quit 
andrew goodman bergdorfs president said in 1973 but we 
indulged him because he was so talented 
his hallmark cardigan draped over the shoulders slinky jerseys 
caftans and other designs swept the country and he opened a 
madison avenue boutique 
but halstons position at the pinnacle of the fashion industry 
began to slip in 1973 when he signed a 16 million deal with 
norton simon inc for his readytowear line his couture operation 
and the halston trademark 
the agreement let norton simon use the halston name for products 
he didnt design 
jc penney co inc approached norton simon with the idea of a 
line of inexpensive halston clothes to be sold exclusively in the 
lowprice department stores and halston agreed that deal was 
signed in 1982 
shortly after that bergdorf goodman announced it would no 
longer sell halston clothes because of the association with penney 
adding to the designers woes norton simon was acquired in a 
takeover of the esmark inc conglomerate by beatrice cos 
beatrice canceled halstons limousines dismissed staff and 
dismantled his company 
revlon bought use of the halston name in december 1986 although 
the designer retained the right to also use it revlon used it on a 
popular fragrance line 
diagnosed about a year ago as infected with hiv the virus that 
causes aids halston moved to northern california to join family 
members living in santa rosa 
he is survived by two brothers and a sister

customs officials said they foiled an attempt 
today to smuggle 40 usmade nuclear trigger components to iraq 
via london 
they said five people were arrested including an iraqi who was 
picked up at heathrow airport and is being expelled from britain 
earlier reports had said two iraqis and up to five other people had 
been taken into custody 
the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said the 
devices arrived from the united states two days earlier and were 
kept under surveillance until the alleged smugglers attempted to 
put them on a scheduled iraqi airways flight to baghdad 
in washington a us customs service spokesman ed kittredge 
said the arrests resulted from an 18month investigation by us 
and british customs officials a sealed indictment has been 
returned in the case in us district court in san diego he said 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said this issue raises 
once again our concern for the nuclear proliferation in the middle 
east it continues to pose a serious risk to us interests and it 
continues to exacerbate regional problems he called on nuclear 
suppliers to exercise special restraint in providing materials to 
this region of the world and we continue to urge that all states 
adhere to the nonproliferation treaty including iraq 
the incident could further strain relations between britain and 
iraq 
earlier this month britain recalled its ambassador from baghdad 
after the iraqis hanged an iranianborn journalist working for a 
british newspaper iraq accused the journalist farzad bazoft of 
spying 
bbctv said customs officials tipped off by their american 
counterparts removed the nuclear devices and substituted harmless 
replacements then waited for the packages to be collected from 
their freight shed 
it showed footage of the operation which it said was shot by an 
nbc crew which had been following the investigation 
the customs officials said the items were capacitors electrical 
devices that form part of the detonation chain of a nuclear bomb 
they said the detainees included three britons and a lebanese 
the home office said the iraqi was being deported because of 
attempted breaches of british laws restricting the export of high 
technology 
a second detainee who was to have been expelled turned out to 
have british citizenship it said 
kittredge said washington was limiting its comment on the 
incident out of deference to the british government theyre 
sensitive about iraq and the number of british citizens there he 
said 
 
professor paul wilkinson a bradford university terrorism 
expert said if theyre trying to smuggle in these highly 
sophisticated trigger devices that means theyre very serious 
about making nuclear weapons and soon 
tony banks a middle east expert at the respected janes defense 
weekly said nuclear triggers are devices for initiating an 
explosion in a nuclear weapon 
this is a very very high technology there are only a very 
few countries in the world capable of manufacturing this type of 
technology and there is no other use for a nuclear triggering 
device than to trigger a nuclear weapon he said 
the foreign office would not link the deportation to the 
disclosure of the smuggling operation and no government agency 
would officially confirm that such an operation had been attempted 
a foreign office spokesman said iraqi ambassador azmi shafiq 
alsalihi was informed of the deportation by senior foreign office 
official roger tomkys who is responsible for middle east affairs 
it was not known whether iraq has nuclear weapons capability 
but it has been developing a longrange missile judged by some 
military analysts to be capable of delivering a nuclear warhead 
in 1981 the israeli air force bombed and destroyed a nuclear 
reactor in iraq which was nearing completion israel claimed the 
reactor would give iraq nuclear weapons capability 
iraq insisted the installation was for peaceful use

sen larry pressler rsd violated senate 
rules and federal law by using his staff to help an elderly woman 
write a campaignrelated letter to newspaper editors democrats 
said wednesday 
the democratic senatorial campaign committee asked the senate 
rules committee in a letter wednesday to tell pressler that this 
practice must be discontinued 
pressler violated restrictions against members of congress using 
their official staff and mailing privileges for campaign business 
dscc attorney robert bauer said at a news conference 
he should not be mixing campaign and senate business in his 
senate offices bauer said 
the letter published earlier this month in the sioux falls 
argusleader and two other south dakota newspapers complained that 
the national committee to preserve social security and medicare had 
endorsed democratic senate candidate ted muenster without polling 
its members 
the letter writer irene mclaughlin 69 of sioux falls said 
she had arthritis and asked presslers sioux falls office to type 
the letter for her 
if it is a mistake to respond to a constituents request to 
assist someone with arthritis in typing a letter that is exactly 
what we did said kevin schieffer the senators chief of staff 
if it is wrong we will correct it as we always do 
schieffer wrote the senate ethics committee on monday seeking 
advice on whether it was proper for presslers staff to have 
prepared the letter 
however schieffers request does not mention the nature of the 
letter only that the writer was supportive of senator 
pressler and angry about a newspaper article 
schieffer said mclaughlin dictated the letter to a pressler 
aide who typed up the letter on his own time schieffer said he 
did not know who paid for the stamps that were used to mail the 
letter or when and where the aide typed it 
they were all her words she dictated it was her idea it was 
her initiative schieffer said 
the democrats complaint was based on an article in the sioux 
falls newspaper that disclosed that presslers staff helped prepare 
the letter mclaughlin had complained to the argusleader that her 
last name was listed incorrectly the newspaper said 
bauer said wednesday that pressler had probably used his staff 
to prepare similar letters to the editor through other people 
however bauer acknowledged his evidence consisted of copies of 
letters about the senate race written by the same people that 
appeared in multiple south dakota newspapers 
in my experience this is not likely to be an undirected 
activity bauer said 
spokesmen for both pressler and muenster have acknowledged that 
they advise supporters on what to write to newspapers pressler has 
used his campaign staff to solicit supporters to write letters to 
the editor schieffer said

rival zulu factions battled 
with guns clubs and knives wednesday in natal province setting 
scores of homes on fire and forcing hundreds of villagers to flee 
into the countryside 
soldiers and police patrolled natal in an effort to quell the 
violence which broke out tuesday and has killed at least two 
people 
the whole socalled valley of death is covered with blue 
smoke i saw 120 homes burning at the same time in a radius of 15 
miles said journalist khaba mkhize after flying over the 
edendale valley near the provincial capital of pietermaritzburg 
from 1000 feet up mkhize saw crowds of more than 1000 
gathering in streets and bodies lying in fields 
police reported two deaths and 25 injuries since tuesday but 
expected the figures would rise local reporters who did not want 
to be named said up to 14 people had been killed 
as night fell officials and monitors reported 1500 people 
fleeing the townships with their belongings loaded onto trucks 
army units and extra police were deployed after some 2000 zulus 
supporting the inkatha party went on rampage with guns and knives 
against supporters of the rival united democratic front observers 
and police say the violence was sparked by the stoning of inkatha 
buses that drove through udf areas after a rally sunday 
inkatha is fighting the udf for control of the region both 
groups oppose apartheid south africas system of racial 
segregation however inkatha supports separate states for 
different tribes or ethnic groups while the udf wants a black 
majority government ruling all of south africa 
police said officers used shotguns and tear gas to disperse mobs 
attacking and burning houses maj piet kitching said the army 
would patrol all night along major routes in the 120squaremile 
area where fighting was reported 
it almost looks as though the whole area is burning said 
kitching 
in a field on one side of a hill a battle was raging we 
could hear the guns said peter kerchhoff of a pietermaritzburg 
peace group on the other side we just heard the weapons being 
fired amongst the trees masses of people were watching the 
confrontations and masses of people were trying to go to the 
rescue of other people in conflict on the hill 
kerchhoff said dirt roads leading to townships were blockaded 
with tree trunks boulders rubbish and burning tires he said 
people were fleeing caluza township where much of the fighting was 
centered houses were burning in several townships and many of 
those fleeing carried with them pieces of furniture he said 
as his group drove through the crowds taking four injured to the 
hospital kerchhoff said people were saying please we need 
guns 
several residents and local journalists said they saw some 
police giving inkatha fighters ammunition supporting them in the 
battles and refusing to confiscate their weapons township 
residents welcomed the armys arrival said mkhize the journalist 
a 13yearold boy in a house in caluza said over the telephone 
the police is coming and shoot the people a helicopter is up 
there 
the boy who could not be identified because of safety concerns 
said his father had left the house because of the war and i 
am running away now 
kerchhoff said he saw young and old men fighting on a distant 
hilltop with sticks clubs and machetelike knives called pangas 
among the inkatha fighters kerchhoff said he saw men in blue 
uniforms but he could not be sure they were police 
one of the injured he transported to a hospital claimed to have 
been shot in the shoulder by police officer kerchhoff said 
police did not respond to the charges but photographers took 
pictures of white security policemen riot squad officers and local 
black police in the company of armed inkatha men near caluza 
hundreds of people have been killed in black factional fighting 
in recent weeks in natal nearly 4000 have died since 1987 as the 
inkatha movement and udf fight for control of the region 
the groups have ignored repeated appeals from nelson mandela and 
other black leaders to end the fighting

the bush administration while avoiding 
inflammatory public statements is making its opposition to the use 
of force in lithuania known to moscow in the strongest fashion 
the white house said today 
presidential spokesman marlin fitzwater said us communications 
with moscow over the tense situation in the rebellious baltic 
republic have included private diplomatic cable messages 
the fact that we have made that position known to them by 
almost every recognized channel which is to say diplomatic and 
direct conversations between secretary of state james a baker 
and soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze as well as 
cable messages to the soviet union indicates that we have 
registered our position in the strongest fashion fitzwater said 
bush found himself confronted in the white house today by 
criticism from some republican lawmakers that his policy on 
lithuania wasnt aggressive enough but he argued forcefully for 
his goslow approach participants at a white house gop leadership 
meeting said 
we had a very spirited exchange and he won said rep newt 
gingrich rga assistant house republican leader 
gingrich said he was one of several gop leaders who voiced 
concern to the president over his cautious policy in reacting to 
soviet moves to block lithuanias seccession 
the lawmaker speaking to reporters on the white house driveway 
said he began the meeting more aggressive more positive than i 
came out 
but gingrich said he was persuaded that any overt us action 
such as formal recognition of lithuania would trigger the 
immediate use of force against lithuania by the soviet army 
gingrich said soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was under 
enormous pressure including from the soviet military to use force 
in lithuania 
we dont gain anything by forcing a confrontation gingrich 
said 
the lawmaker said he was educated by todays white house 
session 
i think it is clear there are extraordinary pressures on both 
sides certainly on lithuanians and on the soviet union and its 
in our interest to promote a peaceful dialogue fitzwater said 
fitzwater and other officials are avoiding inflammatory 
language in public comments on the soviet use of force in 
lithuania but say they are keeping diplomatic channels open with 
the soviets 
some officials have said private messages to moscow are much 
stronger than the public statements 
we are letting them know that if they really crack down we 
will react and not just the administration congress could take 
steps and we might not be able to control the reaction said one 
administration source who requested anonymity 
one senior administration official suggested baker had sent a 
cable tuesday to shevardnadze that dealt with us concerns over 
lithuania in much sharper language than contained in the white 
house statement 
later state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler denied 
that baker had sent a message she called that report erroneous 
and fitzwater said he did not think such a cable had been sent 
on tuesday that there may have been confusion with an earlier 
cable over the weekend 
still the spokesman said i think that the soviet union is 
certainly aware of our position 
soviet officials said they expected the lithuanian controversy 
to be high on the agenda when shevardnadze visits washington early 
next month 
the us government has never acknowledged the soviet annexation 
of lithuania and its sister republics of latvia and estonia during 
world war ii latvia and estonia are moving more slowly toward 
independence 
lithuania declared independence on march 11 and since then the 
soviet military has increased pressure on the republic 
soviet soldiers jeopardized the improvement of ussoviet 
relations by breaking into two hospitals in lithuania to detain 
lithuanian deserters from the soviet army 
possible us responses include postponing a summit scheduled 
for june or delaying treaties on nuclear chemical and conventional 
arms said two wellplaced sources who also requested anonymity 
we dont want to do something that would punish us as much as 
the russians said one source a likely first step would be 
suspension of trade talks designed to give the soviet union most 
favored nation status in commerce with the united states 
gorbachev has shunned direct public comment on lithuania 
letting defense minister dmitri yazov and other generals issue 
warnings said a senior american intelligence analyst 
the soviet constitution gives the 15 republics the right to 
secede but none has tried it before 
gorbachev may be avoiding public comment on lithuania allowing 
his generals to make threats and use limited force so that he can 
later disown the policy sources suggested 
gorbachev met monday with sen edward m kennedy dmass and 
kennedy later quoted him as saying the kremlin would not use force 
in lithuania unless lives were threatened 
a senior soviet diplomat in washington told a news conference 
tuesday that lithuania likely would be allowed to secede but not 
immediately 
the central government wants the lithuanians to hold a 
referendum on secession and open negotiations with moscow on issues 
including the rights of nonlithuanians in the republic soviet 
military bases there and compensation for major enterprises built 
there by the central government said sergei chetverikov the no 3 
man at the soviet embassy

exhibit we strongly look forward to the establishment of a 
democratic south africa where there is no racial discrimination

this was going to be a simple a story about 
computer viruses until the hackers intruded until the hackers 
intruded until the hackers intruded 
you get the idea there are a lot of problems facing the 
nations computers within and without 
from big mainframes at universities and government installations 
to the personal computer that keeps track of your household 
finances the equipment is vulnerable to a variety of intrusions by 
pranksters vandals and just plain thieves say computer experts 
but the industry is split over how to deal with the threat or 
even what the threat is 
nearly all agree however with the assessment of bill murray 
an information system security expert with the accounting firm of 
ernst amp young if people become sufficiently fearful theyll 
stop using computers 
in 1989 computer software and related services were a 60 
billion industry in the united states software are the sets of 
instructions that tell computers what to do 
some experts believe the biggest threat comes from rogue 
programs viruses bombs and worms called malicious 
software they can cripple a personal computer or a network by 
scrambling or deleting data or simply duplicating itself like the 
first paragraph of this story eating up valuable storage space 
news reports about these programs like the friday the 13th 
virus that failed to materialize in large numbers last october 
have panicked many computer users 
other experts focus on the selfstyled catchmeifyoucan 
hackers who make a game of out of invading the computer systems of 
industry and government 
less than three months ago a federal court jury in syracuse 
ny convicted a former graduate student of unleashing a computer 
worm program that disrupted a nationwide computer system 
internet 
earlier this month reports surfaced of a new intruder in the 
same system indicating that not every worm may have turned 
what we have seen and can confirm is an intruder was making 
persistent attempts to get into the internet systems said terry 
mcgillen a spokesman for the software engineering institute a 
defense departmentfunded operation that oversees the computer 
emergency response team or cert 
we know of several systems that have been broken into and 
several more attempts on march 15 and 16 said mcgillen however 
he declined to say where the intrusions occurred in the massive 
internet system which is linked to 200000 computer terminals 
including ones at the national aeronautics and space administration 
mcgillen said it was cert policy not to protect the innocent 
or even the guilty but to encourage victims to share their 
experiences with intruders 
such information is often difficult if not impossible to come 
by said several computer experts 
as far as computer crime is concerned i can assure you there 
are no valid numbers said donn b parker a computer security 
expert at sri international a research center in menlo park calif 
the reason he added is because the victims do all they can to 
avoid reporting it 
large corporations universities and government agencies out of 
embarassment or fear of encouraging further tampering dont like 
to admit publicly theyve been hit by a virus or hacker agreed 
stuart katzke of the national institute of standards and 
technology a federal agency in gaithersburg md 
thats been a problem with the computer security area for a 
long time people choose to cover up incidents and not report 
them added katzke chief of nists division of computer security 
nist doesnt compile listings of computer security problems 
neither does cert 
last month attorney general dick thornburgh said increasingly 
computers are being found in illegal activities of drug networks 
but the fbi lacks hard data on software crime because computers are 
often perceived as a tool in committing other crimes such as fraud 
and theft said an fbi spokeswoman in washington 
in relation to other crimes its more a medium than the 
actual culprit explained kelley cibalus the spokeswoman 
the lack of centralized information about computer security was 
something we heard at the hearings conducted last fall by a 
subcommittee of the house judiciary committee said eric hauser an 
aide to rep charles schumer dny the subcommittees chairman 
legislation to restrict computer viruses is pending in various 
forms before the criminal justice subcommittee in the house and is 
being explored on the senate side 
while the debate rages over whether hackers or viruses are the 
main threat to computer security experts agree that attitudes have 
to change about interfering with someone elses equipment for 
whatever reason 
one thing being discussed in the industry said nists 
dennis steinauer is what should we do to instill an updated 
sense of ethics computer and network technology is of value to us 
all but tampering undermines the technology for all of us because 
it usually means restrictions are placed on it

richard nixon says that a most unfortunate 
disclosure during watergate was that he used foul language in the 
oval office other presidents also swore he says but none of 
them had the bad judgment to have it on tape 
most people swear at one time or another he says but since 
neither i nor most other presidents had ever used profanity in 
public millions were shocked i have heard other presidents use 
very earthy language in the oval office 
nixon says this in in the arena a book summing up his life 
the seventh book he has published since resigning the presidency in 
1974 is the most personal statement of how he has come to feel at 
peace with himself only when you have been in the depths can you 
truly appreciate the heights he says 
in the end what matters is that you have always lived life to 
the hilt he writes i have won some great victories and 
suffered some devastating defeats but win or lose i feel 
fortunate to have come to that time in life when i can finally 
enjoy what my quaker grandmother would have called peace at the 
center 
at the height of the watergate scandal in april 1974 nixon 
released a 1300page volume of transcripts of secretly taped 
conversation they were heavily edited to put private comments in 
the most favorable light and are especially remembered for hundreds 
of designations expletive deleted 
later when the blanks were filled in nixons heavy use of 
barnyard language was laid bare for example instructing aide john 
dean he said i dont give a shit what happens i want you all to 
stonewall it at another meeting he told dean and former attorney 
general john mitchell the point is get the goddamn thing over 
with 
the 369page book is to be published by simon amp schuster on may 
2 excerpts appearing in the current issue of time magazine focus 
on his attempts to debunk myths about his role in watergate he 
characterizes as the most blatantly false myth the assertion 
that he knew in advance about the 1972 breakin at democratic 
headquarters in the watergate however no one knowledgeable has 
made that claim 
nixon said the most serious myth was that on my specific 
orders the cia obstructed the fbi investigation of watergate in 
fact the disclosure that cost him the presidency was that he tried 
to bring that about even though his instruction was rebuffed by 
the cia 
the nixon in the book at 77 is a mellower nixon than he 
previously showed himself to be for instance he says kind things 
about journalists i could not possibly have gone as far as i did 
in the political arena without having the benefit of some balanced 
as well as negative coverage 
and he takes a surprisingly relaxed view of flag burning if 
the day comes when they refrain from desecrating it only because of 
the law or some dimly remembered custom it will have truly become 
an empty symbol he says 
nixon says his wife pat had better political instincts than he 
did 
she urged me not to run for governor of california he says 
she was right nixon lost that race in 1962 two years after he 
lost the presidency to john f kennedy and snarled at reporters 
you wont have nixon to kick around any more because gentlemen 
this is my last press conference 
nixon says the question he is asked most frequently is hows 
pat his reply 
considering what she has been through she is remarkably well 
you would never know that she had suffered a stroke she no longer 
participates in public events but devotes all of her time and 
energy to her children and four grandchildren 
nixon observes how television has changed politics saying 
theres little correlation between what makes a good leader and 
what is a good tv performance 
in the age of soundbites the threeminute gettysburg address 
would have been 2 12 minutes too long he writes one of 
todays ambitious young correspondents would probably have summed 
it up this way the president himself admitted to this subdued 
pennsylvania crowd what his men have been saying privately that no 
one will long remember what he said here

richard nixon thinks some reporters are con 
artists who dont always tell the truth when theyre interviewing 
public figures here from his book in the arena is what he 
thinks reporters mean by some of their lines 
i really want to write a positive story 
nixon this is usually a signal that subject should watch his 
back because someone is about to stick a knife into it 
if you dont talk to me your side of the story wont be 
represented 
nixon when you get this line from a reporter trust your 
instincts does he want your views or just the legitimacy that your 
participation in the story will give him in a way this con is a 
form of blackmail talk to me or else 
you should hear what this other guy said about you 
nixon this is journalistic entrapment a favorite tactic of 
reporters who want to provoke you into saying something critical 
about the other guy dont be suprised if your angry jibe appears 
in print and his doesnt 
im going to write the story whether you talk to me or not 
nixon when you hear this you should consider whether the 
reporter might be worried he doesnt have a story at all unless you 
talk to him 
oh and just one more question 
nixon forget the other 10 he asked this is what he really came

political action committees controlled by 
members of congress raised more than 15 million in the past three 
years and donated more than 3 million of that to other candidates 
for office according to an analysis released thursday 
common cause which wants congress to outlaw the socalled 
member pacs said five members of congress had pacs which 
raised more than 1 million in the past two years 
the analysis based on yearend financial reports filed with the 
federal election committee covered 32 pacs associated with current 
members of congress that raised at least 25000 from jan 1 1987 
through dec 31 1989 
those 32 pacs raised 1496 million in the threeyear period 
common cause said the total raised by the member pacs in that 
period surpasses 15 million if 15 additional member pacs which 
raised less than 25000 each in the period are also counted 
common cause the selfstyled public interest group has been 
heavily lobbying congress to make several major changes to campaign 
finance laws the group has long been critical of allowing members 
of congress to establish pacs saying such committeess allow 
special interests to curry favor with lawmakers by donating to 
their campaigns and the membercontrolled pacs 
members of congress can put the money to a variety of uses 
provided they are related to the members political activities 
that provision has been loosely interpreted to allow member pacs to 
make contributions to other candidates and to pay for political 
travels and expenses 
common cause said five members have pacs that raised more than 
1 million each during the threeyear period the lamwakers and 
amounts raised by their pacs in the last three years are senate 
republican leader robert dole of kansas 5 million sen alan 
cranston dcalif 15 million sen richard lugar rind 14 
million sen edward m kennedy dmass 11 million and rep 
patricia schroeder dcolo 1 million 
the top three democratic house leaders also have member pacs 
speaker thomas foleys house leadership fund raised 353509 in the 
threeyear period according to its report to the fec majority 
leader richard gephardts pac raised 495000 in the period and 
majority whip william grays pac raised 346000 
the pac controlled by house republican leader robert michel of 
illinois raised 72000 in the same period and distributed more 
than half of its receipts to gop candidates

government troops destroyed a heavily 
fortified communist rebel training camp after two days of fierce 
fighting that left 59 insurgents and one soldier dead the military 
reported wednesday 
armed forces spokesman col juanito rimando said 23 troops were 
wounded as 1200 soldiers stormed the camp 
the report we received was sketchy but judging by the size of 
the government casualties i would say that it must have been a 
really big gunbattle rimando said 
he said a platoon of army scout rangers discovered the heavily 
fortified camp used by the communist new peoples army on sunday 
it was in the remote mountain town of lianga in surigao del sur 
province about 540 miles southeast of manila 
rimando said the troops called for reinforcements and a twoday 
firefight ensued after rebel sentries spotted the soldiers around 
the camp 
he said the rebels were armed with usmade m60 machineguns 
grenade launchers and automatic rifles 
rimando said many of the rebels fled during the battle

a plan to give state money to poor parents so 
that their children can attend private schools could be a national 
model supporters say but critics say the idea suggests that 
people have given up on city schools 
the legislature last week passed a bill that would give as much 
as 2500 to each of nearly 1000 lowincome milwaukee students to 
help them leave the public schools and enroll in nonsectarian 
private schools the average yearly tuition at the academies is 
3200 
the experiment would affect about 1 percent of the citys 
estimated 97000 students the state funds used would be deducted 
from the citys school budget 
gov tommy g thompson said he will sign the bill into law by 
april 27 but will wait to see the results of the milwaukee program 
before deciding whether the school choice plan should be expanded 
statewide 
us education undersecretary ted sanders who praised the 
experiment said the plan could provide a form for restructuring 
us schools and give options to parents whose choices have been 
curtailed by their income 
but a spokesman for the nations largest teachers union 
denounced the plan it could lead to racial educational and 
economic isolation of students those children left behind will 
feel the impact said howard carroll of the national education 
association 
milwaukees school superintendent robert peterkin also opposes 
the plan saying it would drain resources from depleted innercity 
schools and reverse two decades of city and surburban school 
desegregation achieved through voluntary busing 
the concept that the competitive market place will magically 
make the public school system improve is simplistic said 
peterkin who gained national attention in integrating cambridge 
mass schools 
peterkin nevertheless has said he wont challenge the program in 
court 
plans that allow parents more choice on where to send their 
children to school have gained momentum in the last five years 
minnesota and iowa were among the first to offer tax credits to 
parents sending their children to private schools wisconsins 
voucher plan would be first in the nation to directly provide 
government funds for the purpose 
parents not more than 75 percent above the federal poverty level 
an income of 12000 for a family of four will be eligible 
those who already send their children to private schools are not 
the bill would take effect for the next school year eight 
milwaukeearea private schools have agreed to accept students 
state rep annette williams a democrat who represents an 
innercity milwaukee district sponsored the plan at the 
invitation of the bush administration she has traveled around the 
nation in recent months touting the idea as a model for future 
schoolchoice plans 
for the first time poor people will get respect because they 
can take their 2500 to a school of their choice and say i want 
my children educated ms williams said 
a spokesman for the states largest teachers union disagreed 
saying the program only ships innercity school problems to the 
suburbs 
what its really saying is milwaukee has some major problems 
we think the problems should be addressed not sent to the 
suburbs said michael brennan legislative director for the 
wisconsin education association council 
we think theyve given up on the public schools in milwaukee 
we think thats a mistake we dont think the answer is to shove 
those kids out of the system and hope the problem goes away 
the wisconsin chapter of the american civil liberties union said 
it will watch the program to assure children are chosen fairly 
not all children black children will be candidates for those 
schools said aclu director eunice edgar those private schools 
will choose which students they accept if its publically funded 
all children should have the option

and his wife barbara the meeting was on the fifth anniversary of 
andersons abduction

president like this so down to earth 
the presidents secretary called glenwood school soon after the 
hostage families reunion to get the pupils home addresses mrs 
reed said his replies started showing up at homes around this

marylands leadership heads a 
magazines rankings of the states financial management while west 
virginiaa ouija board guesswork drags that state down to last 
financial world magazine in its april 17 issue said it 
evaluated each state as if it were an independent business with 
emphasis on balancing the budget accurately predicting revenue and 
using generally accepted accounting principles 
maryland has an excellent accounting system conducts regular 
performance evaluations and uses a solid development department to 
attract bigname companies to the state the new yorkbased 
magazine said 
maryland also keeps spending in line with increases in personal 
income the magazine said 
utah was ranked second followed by minnesota pennsylvania and 
south carolina 
at the bottom of the list were massachusetts in 48th followed 
by louisiana and west virginia which raised taxes a record 392 
million last year while trying to straighten out its finances 
at least louisiana has oil the magazine said west 
virginia has had almost nothing except cheap coal corrupt 
government and poverty expenditure estimates are little better 
than ouiji board guesswork 
the magazine said west virginias employee pension funds are 
grossly underfunded its infrastructure is awful and its 
computer system is behind the times 
chuck polan secretary of the west virginia department of 
administration said the article had raised some valid issues the 
state is working on but i thought the analysis was pretty 
shallow on west virginia and all states 
the magazine hailed utah for keeping its debt low and 
shortterm minnesota for its performance evaluations and huge 
rainy day fund pennsylvania for its accurate forecasting of 
revenues and south carolina for its focus on attracting investment 
and business 
the rankings do not reflect the best places to live the 
magazine said its entirely possible that the average citizen of 
west virginia is far more comfortable in his state than the typical 
marylander the article said 
the magazine said it interviewed state treasurers chief budget 
officers and legislative leaders in each state

the massachusetts democrat had said he would make no political 
announcement until the committee discloses its findings into his 
relationship with stephen gobie however frank said he would begin 
raising campaign funds 
you reach the point where if you dont do anything youve 
decided by default frank said 
congressional candidates must formally submit nomination papers 
by may 8 
a closeddoor session of the ethics committee was set for 
wednesday afternoon and there was speculation that an announcement 
would be made on the frank case 
rep chester atkins dmass a member of the panel planned to 
attend the meeting his attendance has been taken as a sign that 
frank was not on the agenda because atkins said last fall he would 
not attend meetings in which the frank case was discussed 
atkins said his friendship with frank and his role as the 
democratic state committee chairman in massachusetts made him 
unable to remain impartial 
frank plans weekend fundraisers in boston and other towns to

that frank was aware he was running a sexforhire ring out of the 
congressmans capitol hill apartment

three lawyers in a cramped office in panama city 
have been quietly trying to unravel a global web of transactions in 
hopes of recovering up to 800 million in assets they say manuel 
noriega looted from panama 
the money has been stored in at least 10 countries during the 
last 21 years masked through shell corporations bank accounts 
homes yachts and other property prosecutors said 
the corrupt arm of noriega did not respect borders it 
violated sovereignties it exported its crimes eusebio 
marchosky head of the panamanian task force said in a speech 
tuesday night before an international conference of government and 
corporate auditors 
us prosecutors of the miami drugtrafficking charges against 
noriega said in january that they had identified about 20 million 
of assets the deposed dictator squirreled away in bank accounts in 
the united states britain and belgium 
after the speech the panamanian prosecutors said noriega still 
has property including a castle in france a ranch in the dominican 
republic and apartments in caracas venezuela and madrid and on 
the island of majorca spain 
the loot also includes sizable bank accounts possibly including 
profits from drug trafficking managed by associates of noriega in 
west berlin hong kong singapore and taiwan said eduardo lombana 
who along with marchosky and gonzalo menendezfranco faces the 
daunting task of recovering the assets 
its our duty to go for all the money you can find from this 
man we dont know exactly how much and we dont know exactly 
where it all is but we know he has more or less 700800 million 
and we want that money said menendezfranco 
while noriega is the primary focus of the search the 
prosecutors say up to 400 people ranging from noriegas military 
associates and family members to former bank managers and local 
officials have taken assets belonging to panama 
its not only noriega its the whole crew said 
menendezfranco at the vault of the national bank the military 
arrived with guns and took out 140 million my colleague has a 
voucher for a yacht worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that 
noriega sold to one of his officers for 12000 the situation 
in panama is really diabolic 
a miamibased magazine called money laundering alert reported 
last month that almost 1 billion was transferred from a swiss bank 
in panama to a grand cayman bank in the four months after noriega 
was indicted in florida in february 1988 the magazine quoted 
classified state department documents 
the special prosecutors who have no computers only four aides 
and not enough money from the bankrupt panamanian government to pay 
the phone bill say us agents have been helpful in sharing 
information and other clues are rolling in daily 
the office has just received a letter from a swedish 
businessman offering to buy property noriega had in sweden said 
menendezfranco adding that they were previously unaware of the 
property 
the 2monthold group is swamped just trying to sort out the 
assets inside panama and has not yet pursued leads in other 
countries also many documents that might have helped track the 
money were destroyed during the us invasion prosecutors said 
much investigation is needed before panama can indict noriega 
and his associates and for now the small mountain of papers and 
computer files seized during the december us invasion should 
remain in the united states for safekeeping marchosky said

teenagers who want to keep cruising 
alive in the city that inspired the film american graffiti may 
find themselves in violation of laws designed to limit the weekend 
rite of passage 
the city council approved the rules tuesday night despite 
testimony from residents who mostly spoke against them many said 
there are few alternatives for youngsters in the central california 
city 
its a niche its a true niche its the way they are 
accepted said ron bower sr president of the cencal street 
rods a car club 
officials said the ordinances were not designed to outlaw 
cruising concentrated on mchenry avenue but to give officers ways 
to control vandalism drugs and gangs 
my personal opinion is that moderate cruising will still exist 
along mchenry said police chief gerald mckinsey 
under the limits motorists who pass checkpoints more than once 
in four hours would face fines ranging from 75 to 250 
pedestrians who routinely gather on the sidewalk and in parking 
lots along the strip would risk equal fines for loitering between 6 
pm and 6 am 
the ordinance which requires a second reading before becoming 
law will not affect the annual graffiti night the june 
celebration of cruising started two years after modesto native 
george lucas film was released in 1973 draws up to 100000 people 
in 30000 cars 
at other times officers would enforce the ordinance within a 
marked nocruising zone on mchenry avenue when traffic moves less 
than 5 mph or intersections are blocked 
the police department drafted the proposals out of concern that 
officers could not reach trouble spots when as many as 5000 cars 
clogged the twomile strip 
much of the problem mckinsey says is that modesto attracts 
teens from other cities where cruising already has been banned 
nearly half of all citations issued along mchenry were to 
nonmodesto residents he said 
peak cruising hours also account for more than half of all 
assaults on mchenry avenue and 78 percent of all drug arrests 
mckinsey said 
backers of restrictions agree that a pastime that grew out of 
the goodnatured 1950s has grown unmanageable in this city of 
130000 
the vandalism drinking drugs and prostitutes filter into our 
street and yards every weekend night said terry mccloskey a 
resident who attended the council meeting many of us feel like 
prisoners in our own homes on weekend nights because were afraid 
of what will happen to our property 
but teenagers say they cruise for the same reason as their 
parents to meet dates and show off their cars 
cruising has become a ritual for teenagers who grew up with the 
legacy of the film american graffiti 
im 17 years old and ive waited all my life to cruise 
said billy moorehead you cant get rid of us were going to 
stay

the us economy grew a modest 11 percent in 
the last quarter better than previously believed the government 
said wednesday analysts predicted the rebound will continue this 
year but at its slowest pace since the last recession 
the economy is still quite sluggish said lawrence 
chimerine senior economic adviser for the wefa group in bala 
cynwyd pa were not in recession and probably wont go into 
recession but economic growth will be very very slow 
the commerce department first reported in january that 
fourthquarter growth had edged up a barely perceptible 05 
percent then revised the rate upward in february to 09 percent 
before issuing its final 11 percent estimate wednesday 
the revision showed an economy on sounder footing than earlier 
reported observed allen sinai chief economist with the boston 
co 
but while the final estimate was an improvement and provided 
fresh reason to believe the economy will avoid a recession it also 
demonstrated softness in some sectors particularly construction 
and manufacturing 
in another report wednesday that pointed to weakness in 
construction the department said that while new home sales in 
february bounced back 31 percent from steep declines in december 
and january the 607000 units sold at a seasonally adjusted annual 
rate last month were well below the 647000 units sold in 1989 
but in a third report the department said fourthquarter 
aftertax corporate profits rose 28 percent it was the first 
advance of the year after declines of 11 percent in the first 
quarter 72 percent in the second and 54 percent in the third 
economic growth in the final three months of 1989 followed 
increases of 37 percent in the first quarter 25 percent in the 
second and 3 percent in the third the 3 percent gain for all of 
1989 was the smallest since a 27 percent advance in 1986 and 
followed increases of 44 percent in 1988 and 37 percent in 1987 
nothing in the report hints at a recession sinai said so 
the focus has to be does slow growth continue or does it 
accelerate the first half of 1990 probably will be more of the 
same between flat growth and 2 percent 
the latest survey of top economists by blue chip economic 
indicators projects growth of 17 percent this year that would be 
the poorest performance since economic activity declined 25 
percent in 1982 during the last recession 
the commerce department attributed its final gnp revision to an 
increase in final sales and a decrease in inventories 
john silvia financial economist with kemper financial services 
inc in chicago said sales rose because consumer spending was up 
just a touch which in turn helped reduce stockpiles and possible 
job losses 
high inventories tend to lead to cutbacks in future 
production he noted it doesnt seem to be the case that 
inventories are going to lead to a slowdown in the economy 
another plus was a 96 percent increase in exports compared to a 
22 percent gain in imports services were up 59 percent 
while overall personal consumption expenditures rose 05 
percent durable goods were down 14 percent and capital investment 
was off 54 percent both signs of sluggishness in the 
manufacturing sector 
an inflation index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 45 
percent last year reinforcing sinais belief that the economy will 
grow sluggishly occasionally flirting with recession until 
inflation gets down low enough to permit the fed to lower interest 
rates 
the federal reserve forced up interest rates last year in its 
fight against inflation while inflation has not declined 
significantly however the bush administration and many economists 
have urged the fed to ease its credit policies to stimulate the 
economy 
the various changes left the gnp expanding in the fourth quarter 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 417 trillion

opposing sides in the supreme courts latest 
affirmative action cases clashed wednesday over the value and 
constitutionality of preferential treatment for women and 
minorities seeking broadcast licenses 
opponents said the preferences arent achieving their goals and 
violate the rights of white men but the policy was defended by the 
federal communications commission and others as a way to let 
missing voices be heard on radio and television 
the court which dealt affirmative action a major setback last 
year heard arguments in cases from florida and connecticut that 
could affect other programs designed to counter the effects of 
alleged past discrimination 
the court is expected to announce decisions in both cases by 
july 
justice antonin scalia took a leading role during the twohour 
session in challenging the fccs policy questioning whether it 
promotes diverse viewpoints 
it has to do with nothing but blood not background and 
environment he said at one point scalia suggested that a black 
person from the wealthy predominantly white community of 
scarsdale ny could benefit from such preferential treatment 
whether you were born in scarsdale or harlem contributes to 
what you believe replied margaret polivy a lawyer for a 
hispanicowned company in florida what we have identified here 
are groups that have been excluded from the mass media 
she said congress regards women and racial minorities as 
missing voices which should be given special consideration in 
the awarding of broadcast station licenses 
achieving equality is a concept that underlies our 
democracy ms polivy added 
but scalia said promoting a colorblind society is just as 
important 
the idea that government benefit should be awarded regardless of 
the color our skin also underlies our democracy he said 
ms polivy represents rainbow broadcasting co which was 
awarded a tv license in orlando fla a rival metro broadcasting 
inc argued unsuccessfully before a federal appeals court that it 
was denied the license unfairly 
gregory guillot metros lawyer said the fccs affirmative 
action program has increased minority ownership of television and 
radio stations by only 1 percent in 18 years 
im no mathematician but that means there will be 600 years 
left before equal racial representation in broadcast company 
ownership is achieved guillot said 
daniel m armstrong representing the commission said some 
raceconscious steps are necessary to make sure women and 
minorities have access to the media 
in the connecticut case a federal appeals court struck down the 
commissions socalled distresssale policy which allows a 
broadcaster faced with the loss of a license to sell to a 
minorityowned buinsess at 75 percent of market value 
the appeals court overturned the award of a license in hartford 
to hispanicled astroline communications co the appeals court gave 
alan shurberg who is white a chance to compete for it 
j roger wollenberg astrolines lawyer said the minority 
groups congress has singled out for preferential treatment really 
and truly have not had a break in our society while the 
constitution may be colorblind the truth is race is with us 
shurbergs attorney harry cole said astroline won the license 
only because its general partner richard p ramirez has a 
hispanic surname why is alan shurberg any less capable of 
increasing diversity just because he is white he asked 
the justices last year struck down an affirmative action program 
in richmond va that set aside a percentage of local public works 
contracts for minorityowned business the ruling cast doubt on the 
validity of numerous preferential plans of states and cities but 
had no direct effect on federal programs 
a less conservative high court in 1980 upheld a federal public 
works program that set aside 10 percent of the funds for minority 
contracts the high court said then that congress has special 
constitutional authority to approve affirmative action 
one reason the commissions affirmative action policies have 
remained in place since the early 1970s is because congress has 
barred it from spending money to restudy or repeal the policies

the supreme court on wednesday gave state 
appeals courts the power to uphold murderers death sentences even 
if their sentencing juries wrongly considered some adverse evidence 
by a 54 vote the justices said appeals courts are empowered to 
reweigh the sentencing evidence in capital punishment cases without 
sending them back for new jury determinations 
the dissenters said the decision may streamline the carrying out 
of capital punishment but at a cost that seems to be 
intolerable 
the court stopped short of upholding the death sentence of 
chandler clemons who had challenged a state courts reweighing of 
the sentencing evidence in his case 
clemons was convicted of killing a delivery man after robbing 
him of 5 in cash and a few pizzas in vicksburg miss three years 
ago 
one of the aggravating factors clemons sentencing jury 
considered was the especially heinous atrocious or cruel 
nature of the crime 
the mississippi supreme court later acknowledged that under 
past rulings by the nations highest court such an aggravating 
factor is unconstitutionally too vague 
but rather than throw out clemons sentence the state supreme 
court ruled that he would have been sentenced to death even if the 
impermissible factor had not been considered 
clemons had contended that such a reweighing by an appellate 
court violated his rights 
rejecting that contention justice byron r white wrote for the 
court the constitution does not prevent a state appellate court 
from upholding a death sentence by reweighing of the 
aggravating and mitigating evidence 
white said state appeals courts also may determine that such an 
error amounted to harmless error 
white was joined by chief justice william h rehnquist and 
justices sandra day oconnor antonin scalia and anthony m kennedy 
justices harry a blackmun william j brennan thurgood 
marshall and john paul stevens dissented 
writing for the four dissenters blackmun said if a death 
sentence is to be imposed it should be pronounced by a 
decisionmaker who will look upon the face of the defendant as he 
renders judgment 
the bloodless alternative approved by the majority 
conveniently may streamline the process of capital sentencing 
blackmun said but at a cost that seems to me to be intolerable 
the decision did not uphold clemons death sentence but instead 
sent his case back to the state supreme court for further study 
white said it was unclear whether the state court actually 
engaged in a reweighing of the sentencing trial evidence or in a 
harmlesserror analysis 
clemons used a shotgun to kill arthur shorter prosecutors said 
because he thought the delivery man might be able to identify him 
as the robber

minorities and the poor should take the lead 
in fighting for clean air and water because they suffer most from 
pollution jesse jackson said wednesday 
the common people who marched for the right to vote must now 
march for the right to breathe jackson said as he launched a 
sixstop rainbow environmental tour

of northeast washington who have been fighting plans to expand an 
electricity generating plant they blame for fouling the air 
his tour is part of the buildup for earth day on april 22 when

the upjohn co of kalamazoo mich has been 
authorized to field test squash and cantaloupe that have been 
genetically altered to resist two major crop diseases the 
agriculture department said wednesday 
james w glosser head of the departments animal and plant 
health inspection service said the squash and cantaloupe have been 
altered to resist cucumber mosaic virus or cmv and papaya 
ringspot virus prv 
glosser said the agency has reviewed the fieldtest procedures 
and determined upjohn is following the necessary steps to assure 
the safety of the field tests in california georgia and michigan 
the tests will be conducted in may in kern and san benito 
counties california worth county ga and kalamazoo county mich 
upjohn will infect the genetically altered squash and cantaloupe 
with cmv and prv under controlled conditions and then monitor the 
plants for disease symptoms glosser said 
current practices for controlling the diseases in the crops 
include chemical treatments buring infected plants and spraying 
fields with low levels of the viruses to stimulate immunity 
glosser said the upjohn field tests are the first permitted by 
the usda agency for genetically altered squash or cantaloupe 
however last august the agency issued a permit to a cornell 
university researcher for a similar study on cmvtolerant cucumbers 
cucumber cantaloupe and squash belong to the same plant family 
and are similarly affected by cmv which results in yellowing and 
in distortion of leaves and fruit 
like all plant viruses cmv and prv do not harm humans the 
agency said

the economists and tax lawyers took over 
wednesday and turned the battle over president bushs no 1 
legislative goal a cut in the tax on capital gains into a 
mindboggling word fight over elasticity static revenue and 
induced realizations 
sen bill bradley dnj had billed it as the finance 
committee equivalent of a oneonone game between michael jordan 
and magic johnson nobody won and there was no evidence any 
member of the senate panel had changed his mind 
the chief combatants kenneth w gideon assistant secretary of 
the treasury for tax policy and ronald a pearlman who used to 
hold that job but now is chief of staff for congresss joint 
committee on taxation 
the issue how would bushs proposal to cut the tax on capital 
gains which are profits from the sale of investments affect 
federal tax collections over the next six years 
the cut would increase revenues by 125 billion gideon said 
the cut would reduce tax revenues by 114 billion pearlman 
said 
thats a difference of 239 billion sizable even by 
washington standards 
pearlman and his staff wrote a 69page pamphlet to justify their 
estimate gideon responded with a 14pager and 29 pages of backup 
explanation charts and tables 
pearlman said almost all the difference was caused by treasury 
and congressional experts who could not agree on how many billion 
dollars worth of capital gains would be pocketed or realized as 
the experts say if there were no change in tax law 
pearlman relied on a congressional budget office projection of 
254 billion worth of capital gains this year up 50 percent from 
1988 he said gains generally rise with the stock market and that 
four times between 1977 and 1988 gains had increased by 50 percent 
over a twoyear period 
gideon cited a white house office of management and budget 
forecast of 214 billion of gains and said the yeartoyear 
relation of realizations to stock prices is weak at best 
gideon emphasized differences with pearlman over elasticity 
that is how much would taxpayers increase or reduce their 
investments in response to a change in tax law 
gideon and the administration are far more optimistic than 
pearlman and democratic leaders of congress that for years to 
come cutting the capitalgains tax will induce people to sell old 
investments and put the money into new ones 
pearlman acknowledged there would be a considerable amount of 
new buying and selling for a year or two as a result of the rate 
cut nevertheless he says the law still would leave many people 
with a strong incentive to hold their investments until death and 
pay a far lower tax 
after a quick review of pearlmans pamphlet gideon said our 
preliminary conclusion is that we find no basis in the arguments 
presented for changing the elasticities utilized in our 
estimates 
the joint committee staff relies on 30 years of historical 
economic data countered pearlman 
michael j boskin bushs chief economics adviser weighed in 
with word that gideons estimates are more representative than 
pearlmans of the extensive research on the effect of changes in 
capitalgains tax rates on realization 
jane gravelle a senior specialist with the library of congress 
presented a brand new study of her own and concluded that a 
capitalgains cut might cost the government even more revenue than 
the joint committee staff predicted 
in the end the experts were conciliatory we respect the 
right of pearlmans staff to hold a different professional 
opinion said gideon 
and ms gravelle reminded the lawmakers of what they have always 
suspected in the final analysis there is always some 
uncertainty associated with statistical studies

doctors will examine ousted communist leader 
erich honecker to determine if he is physically and mentally able 
to face charges of corruption and abuse of power a prosecutor said 
wednesday 
a team of medical specialists including psychiatrists will 
also examine other officials from honeckers regime to determine 
their competency to stand trial said deputy chief prosecutor 
lothar reuter 
the examination further increases the chances that the 
77yearold man who ruled east germany under strict socialism for 
17 years will avoid a criminal trial 
much of the fervor to prosecute the former authorities has eased 
as some of east germanys freely elected leaders struggle with 
allegations they had ties to the communist government and its 
network of functionaries and informants 
reuters announcement described by the state news agency adn as 
his personal recommendation came two days after the chief 
prosecutors office said there were no grounds to charge honecker 
former economics minister guenther mittag and former state security 
chief erich mielke with high treason 
chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph also said that honecker and 
the other two had been cleared of conspiracy charges 
but honecker now in poor health and other officials are still 
under investigation for charges of corruption and abuse of power 
reuter said the independent medical team plans to complete its 
examinations by the end of april 
honecker and the 64yearold mittag are accused of embezzling 
state funds to build vacation homes and buy luxuries 
mielke 84 is charged with abusing his control of the state 
security system 
the prosecutors office said indictments against members of 
honeckers regime were not expected before may or june it said 
trials of the three probably would not begin before summer because 
of the poor health of all three men 
honeckers government was deposed in october by a massive 
peaceful revolt he was arrested in january after undergoing 
surgery for kidney cancer and was freed the next day

nasa began preparations wednesday to 
load the 15 billion hubble space telescope into the shuttle 
discovery after working out a few bugs namely gnatlike midges 
technicians snared about 40 of the insects before removing the 
traps and preparing for thursdays installation 
were up and running said george diller a spokesman for 
the national aeronautics and space administration 
the agency had planned to install the telescope in the orbiter 
tuesday but it was forced to delay the procedure after midges were 
found in a payload preparation room on the launch tower 
engineers feared the insects might damage the fragile 
25000pound telescope the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever 
built 
nasa decided to proceed with preparations to install the 
telescope after only three or so midges were captured late tuesday 
and early wednesday during the previous 24 hours 37 midges had 
been sucked into 4foot cylinders containing lights and fans that 
apparently lured the insects 
technicians spent wednesday removing the special protective bag 
from the telescope and opening discoverys payload bay door 
the delay in loading the telescope will not affect discoverys 
scheduled april 12 liftoff diller said the launch may be moved up 
a day or two in fact since technicians needed little of the 
contingency time built into discoverys prelaunch program 
discoverys five astronauts are to deploy the hubble on the 
second day of the fiveday mission once it begins orbiting 370 
miles above earth the telescope will be capable of looking seven 
times more deeply into space and detecting objects 50 times fainter 
than the best groundbased observatory 
astronomers will be able to look back almost to the beginning of 
time by studying stars and galaxies so distant that their light has 
been traveling toward earth for 14 billion years

critics on both sides of the border wednesday 
denounced a west german government proposal to grant amnesty to 
former members of east germanys hated secret police 
in bonn members of chancellor helmut kohls junior coalition 
partners the free democrats joined with the leftleaning 
opposition social democrats in rejecting a government proposal to 
grant amnesty to former members of the secret police force known as 
the stasi 
the 85000member stasi and its 109000 informers were used by 
east germanys hardline stalinist government for decades to 
control the country 
under pressure from prodemocracy groups outgoing premier hans 
modrow ordered the secret police disbanded after the overthrow of 
hardliner erich honecker last fall 
since east germanys first free elections on march 18 which 
were won by a coalition headed by lothar de maiziere there have 
been allegations some of the new 400member parliament may have 
secret police links 
the allegations have targeted de maiziere and the leader of 
another party ibrahim boehme of the social democrats both have 
denied any links to the secret police but boehme has temporarily 
resigned his party post until his name is cleared 
west german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said tuesday 
a generous amnesty for the stasi may be needed to quell 
further instability in east germany 
not everyone who was forced to report to the stasi was a 
criminal schaeuble said kohl later told reporters he agreed 
in principle with the proposal 
gerhard baum deputy chairman of the free democrats strongly 
rejected the amnesty proposal wednesday 
the new democracy in the gdr east germany must start with a 
thorough study of the past not by drawing a line under it as if 
it never existed baum said 
the moral side of the changes in the gdr should not be 
forgotten baum said 
he acknowledged that many stasi members were innocent of 
wrongdoing but added purposely committed illegal wrongs cannot 
be allowed to be swept under the table 
horst ehmke of the main opposition social democrats also blasted 
the suggested amnesty 
the freely elected parliament cannot sweep the stasi affairs 
under the rug without seriously damaging the young democracy 
ehmke said 
former stasi members should be allowed to begin new careers 
baum said but it is out of the question to allow them to hold 
important political posts 
east german leftist groups have demanded an immediate 
investigation into the allegations against newly elected parliament 
members they called for demonstrations thursday to press their 
demands to determine which deputies may be linked to the stasi

high interest rates and declining consumer 
confidence somewhat depressed new home sales in february although 
they bounced back slightly from steep declines the previous two 
months according to commerce department figures released wednesday 
the department said new singlefamily homes were sold at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 607000 units in february after 
plummeting 68 percent in january and a revised 80 percent in 
december 
but the february rate still was below the 649000 homes sold in 
1989 and except for january the lowest since 556000 homes were 
sold on an annual basis last march sales totaled 589000 in 
january 
the housing industry has been adversely affected by the 
increase in mortgage rates in january and february said 
economist richard peach of the mortgage bankers association i 
dont see much of a decline in rates in the months ahead and 
theres substantial risk that they will go higher in the second 
half of the year 
david seiders chief economist for the national association of 
home builders also pointed to weakness in the economy including 
slower job growth as contributing to a decline in consumer 
confidence and thus softer sales 
the federal home loan mortgage corp said interest on fixedrate 
mortgages rose from 1017 percent at the beginning of february to 
1031 percent before falling to 1023 percent at months end 
mark obrinsky an economist with the federal national mortgage 
association described the 10 percent level a psychological 
barrier that was keeping the housing market a little weaker than 
at the end of 1989 when rates dropped into single digits 
john a tuccillo chief economist for the national association 
of realtors also blamed high mortgage rates for a 23 percent 
decline in existing home sales last month the realtors said the 
february pace was the slowest in seven months 
many analysts had expected sales to surge with the unusually 
warm weather in january and february following the fourth coldest 
december on record 
but obrinsky said the median time to find a house is about seven 
weeks so that some that sat on the sidelines in december may 
still be looking but havent found their house yet 
its possible we could see some further increases in march and 
april he said 
sales were up 213 percent to 256000 units at an annual rate in 
the south more than rebounding from a 163 percent decline in 
january but sales fell elsewhere in the nation 
they were down 18 percent to 82000 units in the northeast 64 
percent to 88000 units in the midwest and 16 percent to 181000 
units in the west

a close adviser to west german chancellor 
helmut kohl predicted wednesday that economic union with east 
germany could come as soon as july 
bernhard vogel chairman of the konrad adenauer foundation 
which is allied with kohls christian democratic union said east 
germany would adopt the west german deutschmark as its currency as 
part of the union 
vogel called it a first courageous step to provide east 
germans with the living conditions of their west german neighbors 
east germans in an election 10 days ago endorsed german 
unification and a market economy by choosing a coalition of 
conservative parties allied with the west german christian 
democrats 
since then vogel said the stream of east germans emigrating to 
west germany has slowed he said that showed east germans expect a 
fundamental improvement in their economic social and political 
situation 
vogel said the drafting of a constitution for all of germany 
would be the next step after economic and monetary consolidation 
he said the fastest approach would be east germany acceding to 
the west german constitution 
vogel offered assurances that a united germany will continue 
to remain a democratic and stable nation 
he said germans wanted to achieve the kind of friendship with 
poland to the east that has existed for years with france to the 
west 
after germanys defeat in world war ii some of its eastern 
territories were turned over to poland which had lost land of its 
own to the soviet union 
we dont want to respond to injustice with injustice vogel 
said for us the polish border is final and definitive but it is 
not enough for us to say that a united germany will have to put 
its seal on this guarantee

swiss authorities said wednesday they 
found no evidence that ousted romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu 
stashed vast sums of cash in a basel bank account 
a similar investigation in geneva is pending 
the suspicion of money being stashed in secret swiss accounts 
was raised by the new romanian government that came to power after 
last decembers revolution in which ceausescu and his wife elena 
were executed by a firing squad 
attorney moritz leuenberger a swiss member of parliament said 
he was tipped by unidentified romanian exiles that ceausescu had 
transferred about 400 million mostly in gold bullion to zurich 
shortly before his downfall 
swiss authorities lifted strict banking secrecy rules after the 
new bucharest leadership asked them for help in its search for 
assets the ceausescus allegedly spirited out of the country during 
their 24year reign 
the swiss government put a precautionary freeze dec 24 on any 
assets linked to ceausescu and his clan that may be in swiss banks 
district attorney walter rothenfluh said an investigation of 
bank files made it seem credible that the basel account opened 
in 1980 was used solely for regular transactions by the romanian 
foreign trade ministry 
rothenfluh declined to name the bank

the third quarter 72 percent in the second and 11 percent in the 
first 
john silvia financial economist with kemper financial services

the us aquaculture industry is young but 
growing rapidly into a major provider of food for an expanding 
world population an agriculture department report said wednesday 
the 1990s should be an important decade for growth the 
report said world population gains and limits on wild catch from 
the oceans should increase the demand for aquaculture products 
acquaculture refers to commercial production of a wide variety 
of fish shellfish and seafood products it includes baitfish 
hatchery operations and the stocking of fish farms 
if us seafood consumption continues to grow the rise in 
demand will likely be met through increased imports and higher 
domestic aquacultural production the report said 
fish farmers and other aquacultural producers have an 
advantage over capture fisheries in that production can rise 
without endangering future supplies 
catfish are the leading species grown commercially in the united 
states production in 1989 rose 16 percent in volume to 342 million 
pounds delivered by farmers the report said 
overall including the wild catch catfish ranked fourth in 1988 
behind pollock salmon and cod and may have moved into third place 
ahead of cod in 1989 the report said 
prices paid to catfish farmers last year averaged 72 cents a 
pound down 6 percent from 1988 because of the larger supply and 
lower prices paid by processors for large fish 
but catfish prices have risen since october and by february had 
reached 75 cents a pound the report said also growers have 
formed a bargaining association that has negotiated prices with 
many processors for the first half of 1990 
the most recent survey of trout growers showed a decrease in the 
number of producers to 478 in 1989 from 518 in 1988 however sales 
of trout and trout eggs rose to 726 million from 664 million in 
1988 
domestically grown farm salmon output was estimated at nine 
million to 10 million pounds in 1989 a sharp increase from six 
million pounds in 1988 the gain was attributed to larger output on 
both the east and west coasts 
oyster production has increased in the northwest while disease 
problems reduced oyster harvesting in the chesapeake bay formerly 
the largest producing area the report said 
pacific coast oyster production grew from 67 million pounds of 
meat with a value of 56 million in 1980 to eight million pounds 
valued at 145 million in 1988 the most recent figures available

leaders of the international monetary fund are 
nearing accord on providing billions of dollars it can lend to 
countries in financial trouble a us official said wednesday 
weve been talking about an increase of 33 to 50 percent and 
its narrowing to the upper end of that range said assistant 
treasury secretary charles h dallara 
the funds managing director michel camdessus has sought a 
doubling of its resources those quotas are equivalent to 117 
billion but much of the money is in the currencies of third world 
countries which borrowers dont want 
the united states britain and saudi arabia were the major 
holdouts against a 100 percent increase 
the united states supplies about one dollar of every five 
available to the fund a 50 percent increase would require about 
12 billion from the united states but the contribution would not 
be counted as increasing the federal deficit 
there is hope for an agreement next week when treasury secretary 
nicholas brady meets in paris with financial leaders from the 
governments of japan west germany britain france canada and 
italy the g7 group tries to coordinate the policies of the 
worlds leading economic powers 
the fund has 152 member governments in recent years its main 
job has been lending to third world countries in return for 
promises of policy changes designed to bring them additional loans 
and put them in better shape to repay 
recent moves in eastern europe away from communism and toward 
market economies have opened new needs for the funds help it 
recently made new loan agreements with poland and hungary 
extensive calls on its resources are expected from argentina 
brazil and other heavily indebted governments 
the accord on new money for the fund has been held up by 
disagreement over the total the position of france and britain as 
japan becomes the second biggest contributor and increases in 
overdue debt to the fund that amount to more than 4 billion

dakota nebraska and iowa according to the report by the office of 
technology assessment 
the ihs declined to comment on the report or the agencys mental 
health services the congressional researchers refused to give the 
agency a copy of the report until it was released to the public 
thursday said ihs spokeswoman patricia deasis 
the ihs has 17 mental health professionals nationwide to serve 
397000 native american children and adolescents nine of them are 
in montana and wyoming 
the resources to cope with these serious problems are clearly 
inadequate said the report which was prepared for the senates 
select committee on indian affairs 
the researchers said scientifically accepted data on the extent 
of mental health problems among indian teenagers is scarce but 
available information suggests indian youth are more prone than 
white teenagers to a laundry list of ills including suicide and 
alcohol and drug abuse 
indians in their early teens are four times more likely to kill 
themselves than youth of other races and suicide rates among 
northern plains tribes have climbed rapidly during the 1980s the 
report said 
in the ihs aberdeen sd region south dakota north dakota 
nebraska and iowa 65 percent of the indian youth who were 
hospitalized in 1988 were treated for attempted suicides up from 
35 percent in 1980 
in minnesota wisconsin and michigan the percentage of 
hospitalized indian youth treated for suicide rose from 37 percent 
in 1980 to 155 percent in 1988 
the mental health problems among indian children are brought on 
by a wide range of other health and family problems including 
divorce and parental substance abuse the congressional researchers 
said 
more than 22 percent of indian adolescents have parents with 
drinking problems compared to 14 percent for other minnesota 
teens a university of minnesota study said 
indian youth are more than twice as likely as other adolescents 
to be living with just one parent and 10 times more likely to be 
living without a parent the study found 
given the hunger and social deprivation which results from 
high unemployment in indian country it should come as no surprise 
to others that the lives of these children are filled with 
stress said sen daniel inouye dhawaii chairman of the indian 
affairs committee 
the report said at least 170 mentalhealth workers were needed 
for indian adolescents 
to recruit the additional workers scholarships could be 
provided to students in mental health fields who promise to work 
with indian children the report recommended

a house committee voted wednesday to cap 
federal spending on the super collider at 5 billion and to hinge 
construction decisions on proof a key component will work 
the house science space and technology committee gave the 8 
billion superconducting super collider its first congressional 
authorization by a 329 vote after an emotionally charged debate on 
the rising cost and questions about technology 
the committee defeated attempts by rep sherwood boehlert 
rny to bar all construction on the collider to be built south 
of dallas until the energy secretary certifies the superconducting 
magnets a key component could be mass produced by industry 
chairman robert a roe dnj said boehlerts amendment could 
result in an 18month delay costing 15 billion to 2 billion 
the energy department originally estimated the total cost at 
44 billion then increased the price to 59 billion last year 
doe officials are suggesting the cost could be closer to 8 billion 
the super collider involves a 54mile underground ring in which 
streams of protons guided by the powerful magnets would be hurled 
at almost the speed of light until they smash together and break 
into even smaller particles scientists say it would recreate the 
physical state of the universe after the big bang a theory 
that the expansion of the universe began with a gigantic explosion 
the bill now goes to the house floor

zimbabweans began voting in elections 
wednesday that will decide whether robert mugabes government the 
sure winner will transform one of africas few westernstyle 
democracies into a oneparty state 
half of zimbabwes 9 million people are registered to ballot in 
the twoday presidential and parliamentary polls the second since 
mugabe led zimbabwe formerly the whiteruled british colony of 
rhodesia to independence in 1980 
mugabe 66 cast his vote at mpofu school in the highfield west 
constituency of harare the capital of zimbabwe just before noon 
seven parties are running in the election but only edgar 
tekeres yearold zimbabwe unity movement is viewed as a serious 
challenger to mugabes governing zimbabwe african national union 
patriotic front 
mugabes party is expected to capture most if not all of the 
108 seats at stake in the 150seat parliament his dream is to 
amend the constitution to establish a oneparty state after winning 
every seat up for election 
tekere insists he can win several seats provided the elections 
are not rigged thus thwarting mugabes goal of a singleparty 
state 
but mugabe told the associated press on wednesday i feel 
quite confident we will win all the seats 
of the 150 seats in parliament 12 have already been granted to 
the governing party because there were no challengers and 30 are 
reserved for tribal chiefs provincial governors and presidential 
nominees all of whom are considered mugabe supporters 
tekere 52 once a close friend of mugabe and cofounder of the 
governing party in 1963 is the first candidate to challenge the 
president 
he had been no 3 in the zanu pf hierarchy as 
secretarygeneral but was dismissed from the governing party after 
accusing senior leaders of corruption 
he wants to block mugabes plan to impose oneparty rule and 
pledges to weed out corruption improve the lot of zimbabweans and 
liberalize the socialist state 
in asking for voter support mugabe points to the thousands of 
landless families granted farms during his administration and to 
the inexpensive schooling and health care to which all zimbabweans 
are entitled 
mugabe who led a sevenyear guerrilla war to end almost a 
century of white minority rule in rhodesia is certain to be 
returned to power 
in the old parliament tekere and an independent sat as the only 
opponents of the government 
while tekere enjoys some support in his tribal stronghold of 
manicaland he still must counter recollections in zimbabwe of how 
after independence he was tried for the murder of an elderly white 
farmer and acquitted on a legal technicality 
tekere said he led gunmen on an attack on the mans small tract 
on mugabes orders after learning about an arms cache there 
campaigning has been the most violent since independence 
tekere has accused mugabe of seeking to impose a marxist 
dictatorship on zimbabwe mugabe has claimed tekere is plotting a 
coup if he loses the elections bloody clashes have taken place 
between rival party supporters 
one of tekeres candidates was shot and wounded 
but police reported no incidents wednesday 
reports from most parts of zimbabwe said voting got off to a 
slow start reflecting the apathy shown by many of the people 
why bother going to vote when we know zanu pf will win 
robson charuma a 33yearold busdriver said in zimbabwes second 
city of bulawayo 
results from the polls are expected to be announced friday 
night according to polling officials

members of the first group of us soviet and 
chinese climbers to try to scale mount everest have reached camp iv 
at 23500 feet less than 6000 feet from the top it was reported 
wednesday 
all 45 people on the climb were in good health except for a 
couple with colds deputy leader warren thompson said in a 
statement issued by the mount everest international peace climb 
team through a public relations company 
the climb is progressing slightly ahead of schedule 
thompson said 
the camp was established earlier this week the climbs 
publicists said 
the expedition is led by jim whittaker of port townsend wash 
the first us climber to scale the 29028foot peak and consists 
of three 15member teams each with five climbers and 10 support 
personnel 
the goal is for one climber from each nation to reach the summit 
of the worlds highest mountain together and to collect trash and 
debris from previous expeditions 
plans call for the group to establish seven camps on the way to 
the top 
the statement said camp iv was reached after a blizzard 
destroyed two tents friday and forced the entire expedition to 
retreat to the base camp at the terminus of main rongbuk glacier in 
tibet about 17000 feet up the mountain

an acne drug can suppress 
precancerous growths in the mouth for up to a year a researcher 
said wednesday 
the work is aimed at suppressing white patches in the mouth 
called leukoplakia which can be a precursor of cancers in the 
mouth pharynx larynx and esophagus altogether those cancers 
afflict 50000 people a year 
the drug called isotretinoin or accutane shrank growths 
significantly for three months and largely prevented progression 
during the following nine months said dr scott lippman 
lippman of the md anderson cancer center in houston 
presented his results at a science writers seminar sponsored by the 
american cancer society 
he stressed that his work does not involve women of childbearing 
age because of isotretinoins risk of causing birth defects 
the study still in progress has included 58 patients 
about 60 percent of patients showed shrinkage of at least half 
their growths after three months of taking isotretinoin orally 
every day lippman said after three months they and the 
nonresponders were randomly assigned to a followup therapy of 
either a lower dose of isotretinoin or doses of another substance 
called beta carotene 
the two followup groups contained equal shares of 
nonresponders lippman said 
in the beta carotene group 56 percent relapsed over the 
following nine months a relapse was defined as growth of the mouth 
lesions or appearance of new ones 
that relapse rate is essentially equal to what another study 
found with no followup treatment at all lippman said 
in contrast only one relapse has been seen so far among 
participants in the lowdose isotretinoin group he said sixty 
percent of these participants improved after going on the low dose 
he said 
side effects from the initial highdose treatment included dry 
skin and lips and an eye condition called conjunctivitis he said 
they were less severe and less frequent on low doses he said 
the work was financed by the national cancer institute 
dr john laszlo the cancer societys senior vice president for 
research said the results look promising 
further work might produce drugs that work as well without 
isotretinoins side effects which can include harm to the liver 
he said 
because of side effects he said he would be worried about 
people using isotretinoin on their own for fighting cancer 
dr arthur mashburg of the veterans administration medical 
center in east orange nj said he believed the focus of the 
study was incorrect 
leukoplakias usually do not progress to cancer he said so the 
leukoplakias that shrink under therapy may not have actually been 
premalignant 
in a second presentation a researcher said his work suggests a 
way to identify breast cancer patients who would not need followup 
treatment after surgery 
perhaps 20 percent of breast cancer patients would fit the 
category and so not require chemotherapy hormonal therapy or 
radiation after surgery said dr thomas nealon jr of st 
vincents hospital and medical center in new york 
those women have a tumor of 2 centimeters or less no spread of 
cancer to the lymph nodes or elsewhere a favorable appearance of 
cancer cells under a microscope a welllimited tumor no cancer in 
vessels leading to the lymph nodes and no tumor cells in the blood 
vessels 
but marc lippman director of the vincent lombardi cancer 
research center at georgetown university in washington said 
nealons results included too few women to convince him 
furthermore only about 7 percent of breast cancer cases might 
meet the criteria he said and most breast cancers occur in 
postmenopausal women for whom treatment with an antiestrogen 
drug called tamoxifen is safe and beneficial he said 
he also said the criteria would be difficult to apply uniformly 
because of judgment calls on appearance of cancer cells

an ira informer identified one of the bombers who 
killed 21 people at two birmingham pubs but six innocent men had 
already been convicted and police failed to follow up the lead a 
british lawmaker said wednesday 
the allegation comes as campaigners are pressuring authorities 
anew over the cases of the birmingham six who were convicted 
of bombing the pubs in 1974 saying they were victims of a 
miscarriage of british justice 
the bombings in that northern city which also left 162 injured 
were the deadliest ever by the irish republican army in its 
campaign to end british rule in northern ireland 
chris mullin a member of the opposition labor party said he 
based his charge on a police document a summary of an interview 
with an ira informer and said it ought to bring the end of this 
scandal 
mullin spoke hours before four alleged bombers were identified 
in granada televisions dramatized documentary who bombed 
birmingham 
the program identified the suspects as a man who served 12 years 
for other offenses a man serving a life sentence in ireland for 
murder and two men now living in ireland one of those two men the 
program alleged was involved in other ira attacks including the 
murder of 11 people in london in 1982 and the bombing in brighton 
in 1984 that nearly killed prime minister margaret thatcher 
granada said a fifth suspect could not be named for security 
reasons 
none of those identified on the program is among the six 
convicted of bombing two pubs in birmingham on nov 21 1974 
west midlands chief constable geoffrey dear said he would 
investigate any new evidence disclosed by the tv broadcast he also 
said police had never claimed the convicted six were the only ones 
involved 
in dublin a high court judge rejected an application by 
attorney frank clarke for an order blocking the television 
broadcast on irelands rte network clarke appeared on behalf of a 
man who claimed he was identified as one of the bombers he was not 
identified in court 
irelands supreme court later declined to hear the case 
the iras legal political wing sinn fein denounced the 
television program the quality and strength of the evidence 
which proves the innocence of the six is not not should be 
dependent upon pointing the finger of suspicion at others it 
said 
mullin who claims to have interviewed four men who carried out 
the bombings would not comment on the identifications made in the 
broadcast 
however he said i advise you to take very seriously the 
granada broadcast 
last week home secretary david waddington ordered a new 
investigation of several matters raised by attorneys for the 
convicts known as the birmingham six waddington has refused 
to say what specific points are under review 
the lie cannot be sustained much longer mullin said at a 
news conference to publicize the third edition of his book on the 
case error of judgment 
mullin said the most important information in the new edition of 
his book concerns a file from the archives of the antiterrorist 
special branch which he received from granada television 
that file was described as a summary of an interview with an ira 
informant who talked about his role in other bombings and named at 
least 20 other members of the birmingham ira or its political wing 
sinn fein 
the informer mullin said talked about meeting six weeks after 
the bombings with an ira man who admitted that he had placed the 
bomb in one of the two pubs mullin says he has interviewed that 
man identified in the book as z 
what this document shows mullin wrote is that as long 
ago as november or december 1975 the police had someone purporting 
to tell them the identity of one of the men who had planted the pub 
bombs he was in a position to know his information on many other 
matters was accurate and yet they chose to take no action 
the cause of the six has been taken up by amnesty international 
the irish government and most recently by cardinal tomas o fiaich 
the roman catholic primate of ireland 
pressure for a review intensified in october after a court set 
aside the convictions of four young people for ira bombings in 
guildford and woolwich in 1974 as in the birmingham case there 
were allegations that police had ignored credible information that 
they had the wrong suspects had coerced confessions and had 
falsified evidence 
five of the six convicts were arrested the night of the bombings 
as they were about to board a ferry to belfast for the funeral of 
an ira man all six johnny walker patrick hill hugh callaghan 
richard mcilkenny gerry hunter and billy power were sentenced to 
life in prison in 1975 
mullin said he has interviewed 14 people with knowledge of the 
bombings including four men directly involved and all agree that 
none of the six convicts was involved

president bush expressed concern wednesday 
over the spread of nuclear weapons in the middle east after the 
arrest of five people in an alleged attempt to supply iraq with 
americanmade devices for triggering nuclear weapons 
we again call upon nuclear suppliers to exercise special 
restraint in providing materials related to the development of 
nuclear chemical and biological weapons and intermediaterange 
missiles in this volatile area the president said in a statement 
while avoiding any direct criticism of iraq bush noted that it 
was one of many nations that have signed the nuclear 
nonproliferation treaty iraqi officials are well aware of our 
views on nuclear proliferation which we have made clear on several 
occasions bush said calling on all nations to abide by the 
treaty 
his statement was issued after five people were arrested in 
britain after an 18month investigation by british and us 
officials in an alleged scheme to deliver 40 devices for nuclear 
weapons to iraq 
bush said the arrest raises once again the administrations 
deep concern about the issue of nuclear proliferation in the middle 
east he said the proliferation of nuclear weapons along with 
chemical arms and intermediaterange missiles continues to pose 
serious threats to us interests as well as the interests of our 
friends in the region 
these programs only serve to heighten regional tensions and 
exacerbate regional problems bush said

the united states has routinely denied asylum 
to refugees from oppression in countries it considers friendly 
while granting asylum to those fleeing communist governments 
amnesty international and congressional critics charged wednesday 
the international human rights organization said that from june 
1983 to september 1989 only 2 percent of guatemalans seeking asylum 
were successful it said the figure for el salvador was 25 percent 
and for haiti just over 2 percent 
by contrast nearly 91 percent of persons seeking asylum from 
romania then under communist rule won their cases 
the united states government is slamming the door to its 
salvadoran guatemalan and haitian neighbors john g healey 
executive director of amnesty international usa said at a news 
conference asylum case after asylum case shows that the state 
department and the immigration and naturalization service deny 
certain people equal treatment 
randy l levine a new york attorney who was ranking associate 
deputy attorney general from 1986 to 1988 took issue with the 
amnesty report 
in my experience most of the refugees from guatemala and el 
salvador would not qualify for asylum because they do not have a 
well founded fear of persecution levine said most of them are 
economic refugees 
nathan kingsley public affairs officer for the state 
departments bureau of human rights and humanitarian affairs which 
advises the ins on asylum matters said he had not seen the amnesty 
report 
the position of the government is that the governments in el 
salvador and guatemala are democratically elected said carl 
albrecht a spokesman for the departments refugee bureau there 
are problems but we view those governments in a different light 
than we did romania or other places where we thought the 
persecution was greater 
a justice department spokesman duke austin said that for five 
years the intergovernmental committee for migration a volunteer 
group based in geneva has monitored salvadorans deported to their 
homeland from the united states and has found no cases of 
persecution it said the state department and others have monitored 
those returned to haiti with similar results 
can it be established that the united states is in fact 
returning people to their native homelands and they are 
subsequently being persecuted austin asked if that is the 
case then we are violating the intent of the law i dont know of 
a single case that has ever been established in el salvador or in 
haiti not one 
he said he did not know of any in guatemala either although he 
was not aware of any similar surveys being made there 
austin also said congress had not complained that the 1980 
refugee act designed to assure equal treatment of asylumseekers 
was not being complied with 
however rep nancy pelosi dcalif in a statement read for 
her by an aide at the news conference commended amnesty 
international for its campaign to end discrimination in the 
application of us immigration laws 
sen edward m kennedy dmass submitted a statement saying 
that the promise of the 1980 law had not been fulfilled for many 
refugees even in our own hemisphere 
sen mark o hatfield rore said it has long been apparent 
to me that us officials have administered the act in a manner 
that discriminates against asylumseekers from friendly nations 
such as el salvador and guatemala the repression in those 
countries is just as real as the repression in nicaragua or 
vietnam 
according to amnestys figures 27 percent of cases from 
nicaragua and nearly a third of those from vietnam were granted 
the organization which monitors human rights violations said 
government bias against asylumseekers from particular countries 
appears to be a worldwide pattern

black enrollment at colleges and universities 
is up after years of decline with the lions share of the increase 
at private institutions according to federal statistics released 
wednesday 
the national institute of independent colleges and universities 
cited education department figures showing a 71 percent increase 
in black enrollment at their institutions between fall 1986 and 
fall 1988 black students increased 02 percent at public 
institutions over the same period 
the rise reverses a trend toward shrinking black enrollments 
between 1982 and 1986 black enrollment dropped 54 percent at 
independent colleges or private and 46 percent at public 
institutions the institute said a similar reversal occurred for 
native americans 
overall minority enrollment at private schools increased 53 
percent from 1986 to 1988 compared to 33 percent during the 
earlier period at public colleges there was a 45 percent hike a 
slowdown from the 54 percent rise charted during the 198286 
period 
richard rosser president of the independent colleges group 
said member schools have used aggressive recruiting tactics and 
made a real commitment to financial aid to achieve the jump in 
minority enrollment 
rosser said that since 1980 independent institutions have 
doubled their financial aid commitment in real dollars while 
financial aid rose only about 9 percent from 1970 to 1980 
frederick s humphries president of historically black florida 
aampm university said its very gratifying to know theres an 
increase in minority enrollment in both public and private 
institutions that needs to happen hopefully all of us can grow 
because we need to grow we need to serve better the minority 
students of america 
florida aampm is one of 117 historically and predominantly black 
colleges that belong to the national association for equal 
opportunity in higher education 
in a separate enrollment study released wednesday at the start 
of a fourday conference the association said fall 1989 enrollment 
at the 117 institutions was 294427 students an increase of 9747 
or 34 percent over fall 1988 enrollment counts 
association president samuel myers said he applauded the 
increase in minority enrollment but warned that all higher 
education institutions must find effective ways to address the 
needs of minority students once they get them on their campuses 
its my hope that these institutions will not only bring those 
students in but that they do something to retain those students 
give them the support they need to graduate myers said 
rosser responded that recent studies show independent 
institutions have a higher retention rate and persistence rate 
for minorities in all programs at all our schools the figures show 
how hard weve been working 
native americans enrollment increased by 92 percent from 1986 
to 1988 at private colleges and universities compared with 36 
percent at their public counterparts for the 198286 period the 
institute said native american enrollment decreased 48 percent at 
the independent schools and increased only 09 percent at public 
institutions 
enrollment of hispanic students in independent higher education 
decreased by 44 percent due primarily to enrollment declines in 
puerto rico enrollment of asian students increased by 223 percent 
in independent colleges and universities and by 105 percent in 
public higher educaiton 
despite the healthier increase in minority enrollment at 
independent schools minorities accounted for a greater proportion 
of the student body at public institutions 199 percent compared 
to 184 percent

committee 
she said her country has no national pesticide policy 
instead policies change frequently according to changes in 
government and the influence of financially interested groups 
she told the panel which is considering a bill to stop us 
companies from exporting chemicals not registered for use in this 
country 
sen patrick leahy dvt called the importing of produce 
sprayed with these pesticides the circle of poison and said his 
top priority in this session of congress is stopping the practice 
onefourth of the produce we eat is imported said leahy 
thats 135 pounds of fruits and vegetables for every man woman 
and child a year 
while agriculture department inspectors have the power to stop 
foods found to contain banned chemicals from entering the united 
states leahys bill would prohibit the export of such pesticides 
in the last two years inspectors have halted imports of beef 
from honduras pineapples from the philippines and carrots from 
latin america after determining that the foods contained pesticides 
banned from use in the united states 
jay vroom president of the national agricultural chemicals 
association said however that leahys bill would hurt countries 
the united states is trying to help 
some pesticides produced in the united states and sold 
overseas are unregistered here because the specific pest controlled 
is not a us problem or crops concerned are generally not grown 
in america like coffee rubber cocoa bananas tea said vroom 
he said attempts to control how other countries use 
agrichemicals would amount to us imperialism 
but ms bolanos de moreno said she would welcome the legislation 
us shoppers buy large quantities of bananas from ecuador 
which also ships plantain coffee cocoa and sugar to the united 
states 
ms bolanos de moreno said ecuador does not have the money or 
staff to evaluate all the chemicals being offered for sale for 
crops there 
in fact we only have one person in charge of reviewing all 
studies submitted for registration she said 
the us pesticide registration process is far more extensive 
and permits regulators to evaluate all the risks associated with a 
products use she said 
she also said the current methods used by the us environmental 
protection agency to advise other countries on risks associated 
with certain chemicals arent working 
she said her country has received few notices from the epa about 
changes it has made in regulations on pesticides she said several 
chemicals were removed from the us market but she was never told 
of the actions 
epa official linda fisher said her agency wants the law on 
exporting pesticides to be strengthened but is not in favor or 
leahys bill 
she said the epa is working on strengthening its export policies 
in hopes of fixing problems ms bolanos de moreno described 
under questioning from leahy ms fisher said the epa presently 
has no authority to stop a us company from exporting a chemical 
that is banned here even if the foreign country has said it 
doesnt want it 
furthermore there is no agency within the federal government 
that a foreign government can call if it wants to keep a 
usmanufactured chemical out of its country she said 
leahy said his bill would not only prevent chemicals banned here 
from being exported but also would stop any food sprayed with 
illegal pesticides from being imported that would protect 
americans from companies that decide to manufacture the illegal 
chemicals elsewhere the senator said 
virtually the same legislation also has been introduced in the 
house and is awaiting hearings there

the state hungarian carrier malev will 
resume flights of soviet jews to israel suspended last week after 
it received terrorist threats from palestinian extremists 
authorities said wednesday 
state television did not say when the flights suspended march 
21 would be resumed 
earlier wednesday the minister of transportation and 
telecommuncations fired malev general manager lajos jahoda the 
state mti news agency reported 
it said jahoda agreed with the decision to fire him which 
was a political consequence of the tension that had emerged after 
flights carrying soviet jews from budapest to tel aviv were 
suspended 
islamic jihad for the liberation of palestine a radical 
lebanonbased group threatened airlines of all nations that help 
fly soviet jews to israel 
israeli officials expect up to 750000 soviet jews to emigrate 
the next decade as the result of relaxed rules in the soviet union 
and tighter entry quotas in the united states the prospect angers 
arab leaders who fear palestinians will be displaced by the influx 
mti quoted israeli foreign minister moshe arens as saying last 
saturday that israel hoped hungary which has just become a 
democracy will not give an example of surrendering to terrorism 
on sunday hungarian foreign minister gyula horn criticized 
malevs rush decision and said it was made without consulting 
the government 
terrorists should not be encouraged through bowing to their 
threats horn added 
in moscow the soviet newspaper literaturnaya gazeta on 
wednesday had criticized malev for suspending the flights accusing 
it of indecisiveness in the fight against international 
terrorism 
the article was published a day after the us administration 
expressed disappointment at the suspension and urged hungary to 
reconsider 
literaturnaya gazeta made no mention of the position taken by 
the soviet national airline aeroflot which stopped selling tickets 
for soviet jewish emigres traveling to hungary 
a group of us jewish leaders on tuesday met with a senior 
soviet foreign ministry official yuri reshetov to express concern 
about the steps taken by aeroflot and malev the missions leader 
marvin lander national chairmanelect of the united jewish appeal 
said 
jewish activists in the soviet union also said a family could 
take up to 880 pounds of luggage on malev and many counted on it 
to transport their most precious belongings they say aeroflot 
would only transport 88 pounds a person 
from january 1989 through january 1990 16700 soviet jews have 
joined about 180000 of their brethren who have emigrated to israel 
since 1967 
the expectations of mass immigration led rightwing prime 
minister yitzhak shamir to suggest israel needed to retain the 
occupied west bank and the gaza strip to house the immigrants 
despite israeli clarifications that it had no such policy 
shamirs suggestion inflamed the arab world israel responded by 
clamping military censorship on immigration figures and routes 
citing arab threats 
several countries joined the soviet ukraine at the united 
nations on wednesday in criticizing the settlement of jews in the 
israelioccupied lands and called for an end to soviet jewish 
emigration there 
the comments came during the third day of security council 
discussions on the settlement of soviet jews in the occupied lands 
the council planned to continue the discussions on thursday 
yugoslav envoy dragoslav pejic speaking for the nonaligned 
countries said the issue constitutes a most serious additional 
element of tension and instability not only in the occupied 
palestinian territories but also in the broader region of the 
middle east 
pakistan india qatar libya bangladesh and tanzania also 
asked an end to settlement of soviet jews in the occupied lands

the late jesse owens whose performance at the 
1936 olympics put the lie to hitlers boasts of racial superiority 
picked up a fifth gold medal wednesday for humanitarian 
contributions in the race of life 
president bush presented the congressional gold medal to his 
widow ruth owens in a ceremony at the white house also attended 
by three daughters and teammates of the track legend 
this saturday marks the 10th anniversary of owens death at age 
66 
the president later hailed owenss multiple gold medals in the 
berlin games a victory for humanity in prepared remarks to a 
banquet sponsored by the us olympic committee 
the olympics like democracy are a kind of dialogue a way 
that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition 
not deadly conflict bush said 
bush called owens who was black an olympic hero and an 
american hero every day of his life born with the gift of 
burning speed 
he was always the fastest said bush recalling the 
afternoon in may 1935 when the ohio state runner broke three world 
records and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes 
talk about a guy in a hurry bush laughed he was the 
epitome of that 
at the 1936 olympic games in berlin owens captured four gold 
medals in the broad jump 100meter dash 200meter dash and 
400meter relay 
the berlin games were to be the showcase of hitlers theories 
on the superiority of the master race until this 23yearold kid 
showed up bush said it was an unrivaled athletic triumph but 
more than that it really was a triumph for all humanity 
bush borrowing a phrase from ruth owens said it was not those 
athletic feats but his humanitarian contributions in the race of 
life that earned owens the congressional gold medal 
owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as a 
special ambassador for sports said bush he said the athletes 
legacy lives on through the jesse owens games a playground 
olympics the jesse owens international trophy for amateur athletes 
and the jesse owens foundation which awards scholarships to needy 
youth 
despite the many honors his greatest satisfaction came from 
his work with youth said mrs owens 74 
attending the ceremony along with owens family were former 
olympians mal whitfield harrison dillard and herb douglass former 
teammates john chavers samuel devine and chester thomas and two 
ohio democrats sen howard metzenbaum and rep louis stokes who 
spearheaded the drive to strike the medal 
the silverhaired mrs owens standing outside the white house 
afterwards called the event absolutely beautiful she added 
im sure with the sun shining straight down jesses watching us 
too

a house committee chairman on wednesday 
charged that the navy is ignoring the possibility that its 
sophisticated aegis air defense system may be vulnerable to 
antiradiation missiles 
the more this issue is reviewed the more our concern grows 
about the navys refusal to address this problem rep john 
dingell dmich said in a march 27 letter to a house colleague 
the staff of the house energy and commerce subcommittee on 
oversight and investigations which dingell chairs has been 
reviewing the navys purchase of the new 12 billion 
guidedmissile destroyer 
the destroyer called the arleigh burke class after the world 
war ii naval hero and former chief of naval operations will be 
equipped with aegis computers as well as tomahawk cruise missiles 
and an expensive allsteel superstructure 
in a letter to rep charles bennett dfla chairman of the 
house armed services subcommittee on seapower and strategic 
critical materials dingell complained that the navy has refused to 
test the aegis system against antiradiation missiles or arms 
missiles which home in on an adversarys radar beams 
dingell described the missiles as effective weapons that more 
nations including the soviets and third world countries are 
consistently developing 
at your feb 28 1990 hearing you suggested they put the 
aegis radar on a raft and run a test against an arm then the navy 
witnesses claimed it would be too expensive and they would not 
learn anything dingell wrote 
why this incredible relunctance to test 
in an interview bennett wondered whether those who prepared the 
letter for dingell had read the navys testimony correctly 
i was surprised at some of the words he used bennett said 
wednesday of the letter he seemed to be saying that the navy did 
not affirm that they had tests that proved to be successful for 
this weapon 
although bennett has complained in the past about dingells 
inquiry into the guidedmissile destroyer he said wednesday that 
he was not objecting to the oversight subcommittees review of the 
program 
however he added that the burke destroyer is the worlds best 
ship regardless of anything hes dingell said 
lt cmdr craig quigley a navy spokesman said questions 
raised in his letter to congressman bennett are not new and have 
been addressed thoroughly by the navy in hearings reports and 
briefings to the congress the navy has full confidence in the 
ticonderoga cruiser and burke destroyer classes using the aegis 
and the aegis combat system including our abilty to counter the arm 
and other missile threats 
navy secretary lawrence garrett said earlier that antiradiation 
missiles should be easier for aegis to detect engage and destroy 
than other types of antiship missiles 
nevertheless dingell said the navy appears to be paralyzed by 
the arm threat 
the lawmaker suggested that bennetts subcommittee demand that 
the navy develop plans for a realistic test of the aegis combat 
system before more funds are spent on the burke destroyer

the bodies of a missionary couple 
were found wednesday in an area where hundreds of civilians have 
been killed in battles between government troops and rebels 
diplomatic sources said 
the bodies of the rev tom jackson 72 an american and his 
british wife june were found in their home village of bahn in 
eastern nimba county the sources said on condition of anonymity 
they spoke from monrovia the liberian capital and abidjan 
capital of neighboring ivory coast 
us and british embassies in monrovia advised their citizens in 
nimba county to leave the region immediately except those working 
at a wellguarded iron ore mine at yekepa near saniquellie town 
fifty americans and 20 to 30 britons are affected the embassies 
said about 6000 americans most of them missionaries live in 
liberia which was founded in 1847 by freed us slaves 
in washington the state department said it could not confirm 
the couple was dead although it had received reports their car was 
found abandoned 
the jacksons belonged to the usbased united liberian inland 
church and had lived in the country for 40 years translating the 
bible into the local gio and mano languages 
jackson was from north carolina and mrs jackson in her late 
50s was from croyden surrey 
reports from monrovia said 16 people including bahn mayor john 
kayea were killed in the town saturday in a gun battle between 
soldiers and rebels the reports could not be immediately confirmed 
they did not mention the missionaries but a source in abidjan 
indicated the couple might have been killed when they tried to stop 
troops killing civilians 
it is not yet known who was responsible for the killings 
one diplomat said very little information is available because 
roads to the village have been cut off by the fighting 
jacksons daughter beth workman of raleigh nc said she 
received reports from missionaries still in the region that 
guerrillas had shot the couple accidentally as they were driving to 
monrovia 
they just heard a car coming and opened fire but it wasnt a 
vendetta she said its sad any way you look at it but at 
least we can feel better about it 
even the rebels respected daddy she said they knew he 
wouldnt get involved i dont think anyone would have had a 
vendetta against him 
the fighting has spread the past two weeks and nimba has been 
cut off from neighboring provinces refugees who fled to monrovia 
last week said troops had burned down villages and killed an 
unknown number of people 
western diplomats and international human rights organizations 
say soldiers have killed hundreds of civilians since they were 
deployed in nimba to crush about 200 rebels led by former civil 
servant charles taylor 
the rebels invaded from ivory coast on dec 24 in a bid to oust 
president samuel doe who has ruled this west african nation since 
a violent coup on april 12 1980 
soldiers in nimba have targeted people of the gio and mano 
tribes to which the rebels belong escalating the rebellion into a 
tribal conflict rebels retaliated by killing civilians of does 
krahn tribe but not on the same scale as the military 
diplomats say the military killings have outraged many people 
and won recruits for the rebels who previously had little support 
doe said last month that his troops have had difficulty 
differentiating between rebels and civilians 
in the past washington has been a generous and loyal supporter 
of doe 
but diplomatic sources say the united states is considering 
cutting back its large embassy in monrovia following a decision to 
end new aid to the country because of continuing rights violations 
and misuse of aid funds

the government on wednesday freed 
six black nationalists jailed for crimes ranging from high treason 
to arms possession a move the six said was aimed at reducing

the international community said muzi nkosi 34 who read a 
statement on behalf of the prisoners after they left robben island 
prison 
the african national congress has demanded freedom for all 
political prisoners before it will open talks on constitutional 
reforms with the whiteminority government

those convicted of politically related crimes 
president fw de klerk has agreed to free prisoners held for 
nonviolent political crimes but he has said the release of 
violent political criminals will have to be negotiated

the house overwhelmingly approved legislation 
wednesday that would create a department of the environment and 
require the federal government to comply with toxic waste 
management laws 
the 37155 vote on a bill to elevate the environmental 
protection agency to cabinetlevel came after a lengthy dispute 
over whether the measure was being weighed down with too many 
controversial requirements that might threaten a veto 
an attempt pushed by the bush administration to substitute a 
clean bill that would have dealt only with creating the new 
department was turned back by a vote of 266161 
republicans argued that the additional provisions were 
designed to embarrass president bush and force a presidential 
veto bush has said he wants to sign a bill creating a department 
of the environment on earth day april 22 
a similar bill elevating the epa to cabinet rank has been 
approved by the senate government affairs committee but has yet to 
be taken up by the full senate which has been preoccupied by clean 
air legislation 
in addition to creating a 15th cabinetlevel agency the house 
bill also would 
require the federal government be subject to the same federal 
environmental laws on disposal of hazardous wastes as industry 
lifting an exemption that over the years has allowed some agencies 
including the defense department to pollute areas near federal 
facilities 
require the new department to limit its use of private 
consultants and take additional actions to guard against conflicts 
of interest involving both consultants and outside advisory panels 
call for creation of an independent bureau of environmental 
statistics within the new department with the director named to a 
fouryear term and not subject to dismissal except for malfeasance 
beef up enforcement activities against polluters with the 
hiring of additional investigators and creation of a new training 
academy for investigators the number of criminal and civil 
investigators would be increased by 30 percent a year over five 
years 
the legislation would take care to insulate the departments new 
statistical bureau to avoid interference in the development of 
environmental statistics and reports it prohibits department 
officials including the secretary as well as other administration 
officials from reviewing the bureaus reports 
rep john conyers dmich one of the key sponsors of the 
legislation said the bill signals a new era of national resolve 
for a clean and safe environment 
he said the legislation will depoliticize the epa provide 
citizens with improved and reliable environmental statistics and 
put a halt to conflicts of interests at the agency 
conyers had cited a case last summer in which government 
scientists had been directed to change congressional testimony on 
global warming by the office of management and budget 
the epa over the years has been criticized for relying too 
heavily on outside consultants and for cases in which consultants 
or advisory boards include people who have associations with 
industry including polluters 
republicans argued during floor debate on the bill that the 
additional provisions interfered in what should be the prerogative 
of the executive branch 
were not here to fine tune or micromanage said minority 
leader robert michel rill 
likewise the bush administration had warned it might veto the 
bill if many of the provisions in the house legislation are 
included in final legislation from congress 
while bush has endorsed elevating the epa to a cabinetlevel 
department he has raised particular concerns over some of the 
house provisions 
administration officials told congressional leaders last week 
that several parts of the house bill especially the provisions 
insulating the new statistical bureau interfere unacceptably 
with the presidents management of the executive branch 
white house and epa officials noted that the bill would prohibit 
other administration officials including the secretary of the 
environment from reviewing reports and works of new bureau of 
environmental statistics and that its director could not be 
dismissed for anything other than malfeasance 
among other complaints were that the bill would restrict the 
hiring of private consultants by the new department and require a 
certain percentage of senior officials including regional 
administrators be hired without consideration of political 
affiliation 
these are measures that are not applied to other agencies 
said epa director william reilly noting that no such restrictions 
are imposed on the bureau of labor statistics which operates 
within the labor department 
neither version of the bill envisions a significant expansion of 
the epa an independent regulatory agency the epa has about 16000 
employees and a budget of 55 billion

platoon leader ivan and his contra 
loyalists relax on a hillside but they cradle m16 rifles in their 
laps and wear hand grenades on their camouflage uniforms like 
medals ready for battle should sandinista guns break the silence 
of the countryside 
a pact between leaders of the contras and nicaraguas new united 
national opposition government calls for the rebels to lay down 
their weapons 
but the rankandfile rebels have no intention of doing that 
if they signed that pact they made an error said ivan 
whose real name is monico gonzalez rivas here in the mountains 
you feel things in your own flesh here is where were going to 
decide 
ivan and his men see the pact signed friday in honduras as a 
death warrant because it makes no mention of what had been a top 
contra demand that the sandinista military also disarm to make way 
for the formation of a neutral army 
i see it as something very difficult this thing of giving up 
our weapons because they would have to order our coffins at the 
same time said platoon member filadelfo lopez castro whose nom 
de guerre is filiberto 
ivan and his platoon can afford to rest at least for a while in 
the rolling farmland 10 miles north of jinotega a provincial 
capital and important sandinista military post 
peasants in this region strongly favor the contras who they 
feed and protect 
andres an area ranch hand who asked he not be further 
identified for fear of the sandinistas strongly opposes the plan 
to disarm the contras 
if they make the boys disarm then all of us might as well 
take to the hills the piricuacos an indian word meaning dogs 
would wipe us out said andres referring to the sandinistas 
ivan 25 has fought the leftist sandinistas for eight years 
seen them sign successive regional peace pacts and enjoyed the 
unexpected thrashing the sandinista front suffered in the feb 25 
elections 
all these treaties its us who have made them sit down to 
negotiate said ivan if were taken out and the sandinistas 
keep their weapons they can stage a coup against uno at any time 
ivans view that the contras will help assure the 
democratization of nicaragua is not reflected in the latest 
negotiations between uno and the sandinista front 
after a month of meetings negotiators on tuesday announced they 
had agreed to a protocol for tranferring power on april 25 when 
presidentelect violeta barrios de chamorro is to be inaugurated 
the document calls on the contras to respect the demobilization 
pact and return to civilian life it also says the sandinistas will 
turn control of the army and police over to uno and that the forces 
will be nonpartisan 
officers now in the army and the interior ministry are 
sandinista front cadres who have undergone extensive political 
indoctrination 
in a democratic country you cant have an army that belongs to 
a party ivan protested in an interview a few hours before the 
protocol was announced 
a few miles away another contra combat unit came down from the 
bush to a tiny shop by a dusty country road where they mingle with 
local people 
patrol leader caminante a pseudonym of juan antonio garcia that 
means walker says a call by the united states for the rebels 
to dismantle or face a cutoff in the us aid they have received 
since 1981 doesnt matter much 
weve got the people behind us and as long as we have that we 
wont starve he said 
invisible the nom de guerre of caminantes secondincommand 
jose alfredo altamirano says the contras held talks with uno 
representatives in the days after the elections 
we told them what we think but one thing is what they tell us 
here and another what they do over there he said referring to 
tegucigalpa honduras 
enforcement of the accord in tegucigalpa for disbanding the 
contras depends on the will of the rebels to voluntarily give up 
their weapons 
the contras top military chief israel galeano cornejo or 
commander franklyn did not sign it instead it was signed by his 
negotiator oscar sovalbarro commander ruben 
there has been speculation that this indicated there was a split 
within the rebel forces 
you tell me that ruben signed the agreement fine did 
franklyn sign it no well there you go ivan said

the army on wednesday freed 
guerrilla leader ronny brunswijk and 10 of his followers a day 
after being ordered to do so by the civilian government 
army chief lt col desi bouterse former ruler of this isolated 
south american republic announced the release of the jungle 
commando leader brunswijk and 10 others at a news conference at the 
army general staff headquarters 
the government of president ramsewak shankar had ordered the 
bush negro rebels freed tuesday one day after they were arrested 
by military police on drug charges the rebels were in the capital 
paramaribo for talks with government officials on ending their 
3year insurgency 
charges against brunswijk stemmed from the jungle commandos 
seizure on march 20 of 2200 pounds of colombian cocaine 
brunswijk said last sunday that his men confiscated the cocaine 
from a plane that took off from cali colombia and landed because 
of bad weather near a rebel base in the bauxite town of moengo 
brunswijk said the rebels also took four colombians into custody 
and confiscated their plane 
two of brunswijks bodyguards were killed in a shootout with 
soldiers during the arrest according to government and military 
authorities 
the jungle commando with 200 to 400 followers claims to 
represent bush negroes descendants of runaway slaves who make up 
about 10 percent of the 400000 population 
the group seeks economic development for bush negroes and an end 
to alleged discriminatory practices fighting between the jungle 
commando and army forces erupted in july 1986 a ceasefire 
currently is in effect 
bouterse told reporters he had been concerned about the possible 
international repercussions of freeing suspects in a drug case 
the armed forces commander said he asked for a written order 
from the public prosecutors office and when he received that 
there was no reason to hold the rebels 
brunswijk who also spoke at the news conference said president 
shankar had ordered his arrest contrary to reports that the 
military had acted on its own there had been speculation that 
bouterse staged the arrest to scuttle the peace negotiations or 
divert attention from rumors of drugtrafficking by the military 
brunswijk a former army sergeant who once served as bouterses 
bodyguard said he would cooperate with the governments 
investigation of drug trafficking but denied any involvement 
bouterse seized power in a 1980 military coup and ruled until 
the election of a civilian government in november 1987 he has 
continued to wield power behind the scenes however and strongly 
opposes a tentative peace settlement that he says would allow the 
insurgents to remain armed and patrol the bush regions of eastern 
suriname where they have their power base 
suriname situated on the northeastern shoulder of south 
america gained independence from the netherlands in 1975

west germany took further action 
wednesday to reduce the steady influx of ethnic germans from 
eastern europe saying fewer reasons existed for them to leave now 
that democracy has taken root there 
interior minister wolfgang schaeuble said bonn has decided 
newcomers will be eligible for generous social assistance here only 
if west german authorities screened them for exile status before 
they leave their homeland 
screening up to now has been done here 
schaeuble said he hopes the bill will clear parliament and take 
effect june 22 
earlier this month west germany decided to end a special 
assistance program for east german resettlers 
east europeans of german heritage have been flooding into west 
germany in the past two years driven in recent months mostly by 
hopes of improving their financial status in this welltodo nation 
about 380000 ethnic germans arrived last year this year the 
figure has already reached 99200 
east european exiles who can prove they have german roots are 
automatically granted citizenship here 
when they arrive ethnic germans are guaranteed shelter while 
they seek to establish new lives and are eligible for generous 
social assistance 
many west germans bitterly resent the newcomers because of 
increased competition for housing and jobs 
they question west germanys expending great sums of money on 
east europeans when political conditions in the east bloc have 
dramatically improved 
schaeuble said on wednesday that political conditions in a 
wouldbe exiles homeland will play a major role in qualifying for 
exile status as an ethnic german 
the countries of origin in eastern europe are on the road to 
democracy in addition to improved travel possibilities people 
living there have more personal freedoms he said 
his proposed law is seen as an attempt not only to encourage 
eastern europeans to stay home but to cut down on the number who 
come to west germany claiming german heritage when such ties are 
either slim or nonexistent 
he said west german diplomatic personnel will do the screening 
in east european countries and the goal will be that only people 
can emigrate to west germany who in fact fulfill the legal 
conditions 
chancellor helmut kohls political opponents the social 
democrats also favor finding ways to cut down on the stream of 
east europeans 
on march 20 kohls cabinet decided to scrap a 40yearold 
resettlement program for new east german arrivals more than 
150000 east germans have arrived this year and about 340000 last 
year

degussa ag a west german firm has agreed 
to pay a penalty of 800000 for reexporting american metals 
useful in making nuclear weapons to north korea and four other 
countries the commerce department announced wednesday 
the other countries were czechoslovakia india italy and 
britain the commerce department said this was one of the largest 
penalties ever imposed for such violations 
we believe the company knew that reexporting usorigin 
nuclearrelated materials required authorization from commerce 
said dennis kloske undersecretary for export administration in a 
statement 
authorization of the shipments to india and north korea would 
have been denied 
edward e dysan of the law firm baker and mckenzie which 
represents degussa in washington said in an interview that the 
shipments had been approved by the west german government there 
was no attempt to conceal the deals and the firm does not either 
acknowledge or deny that they were illegal dyson added degussa 
has its headquarterers in frankfurt west germany 
the department said that in 1986 amd 1987 degussa sent three 
shipments of zirconium to north korea czechoslovakia and italy 
zirconium is used to encase uranium rods so that they can be used 
in nuclear reactors 
it said that in 1984 and 1987 degussa sent three shipments of 
beryllium to india and britain beryllium is used in designing 
fabricating and testing nuclear explosives 
the commerce department statement said that in addition to 
paying the penalty degussa has promised 
to maintain a special unit to see that it complies with us 
rules 
to report all deals for six months in beryllium zirconium and 
other metals of us origin 
to permit the department to make unannounced inspections of its 
special metals facilities in west germany

the bush administration on wednesday withdrew 
its request to congress to delay 22 billion in pentagon 
expenditures this year avoiding a potential dispute over the 
authority of the executive branch 
we are pleased to inform you officially that we no longer 
intend to withhold the funds that have been deferred white house 
budget chief richard darman said in a letter to sen robert byrd 
dwva chairman of the senate appropriations committee 
presidents routinely ask congres to delay billions of dollars of 
planned spending each year by law these requests commonly known 
as deferrals are permissible because of unexpected contingencies 
or a chance to save money through better management the delays are 
not allowed for policy reasons 
but the bush administration in making the request to lawmakers 
on feb 6 justified the deferrals saying this proposal 
reflects changes in requirements in view of promising developments 
in the soviet union and eastern europe 
byrd and sen mark hatfield of oregon ranking republican on the 
appropriations committee later complained that some of the 
requests appear to go well beyond the permissible housekeeping 
deferrals 
the deferrals also drew the ire of several lawmakers who favor 
the particular programs that would have been affected 
among the deferrals were 200 million for the v22 osprey 
tiltrotor which is manufactured in texas and pennsylvania 593 
million for construction and conversion of navy ships work that is 
a boon to many coastal states and 325 million for the coast 
guards purchase of an icebreaker 
on tuesday the house appropriations committee had included 
language in its 24 billion supplemental money bill disapproving 
the administrations request to defer 22 billion in pentagon 
spending 
instead the panel in talks with the pentagon and the office of 
management and budget found 18 billion in defense cuts that will 
partly offset the cost of the supplemental

the governing nationalist party wednesday 
urged elderly lawmakers many in their 80s and 90s and who have not 
faced reelection in four decades to bow to popular demand and 
retire 
the statement from top party officials added new pressure on the 
legislators frozen in office since 1949 when the nationalists lost 
a civil war on mainland china lawmakers terms were extended 
indefinitely to support the nationalists claim to be chinas 
legitimate government 
the oldguard lawmakers members of the nationalist party 
occupy 658 seats in the 752member national assembly or electoral 
college part of taiwans tricameral parliament 
this party hopes the senior legislators can understand public 
demands and make a wise decision said party spokesman james chu 
elderly lawmakers in the assembly stirred nationwide resentment 
this month by proposing large increases to their power and pay 
they were the target of the largest demonstration in taiwan 
since martial law was lifted three years ago the protest forced 
president lee tenghui to promise further political reforms 
chu said party officials would decide how to retire 70 senior 
members from the lawmaking legislative yuan this year and other 
elderly legislators within two years 
but chu said the governing party continued to respect the 
elderly lawmakers and the contributions they have made to the party 
also on wednesday younger members of the national assembly 
passed a resolution to expel senior colleagues who are too frail to 
attend session

extremist groups claimed 
responsibility wednesday for the slaying of an american missionary 
who was shot to death in his south lebanon home by masked intruders 
who burst in as he prayed with his family 
the groups accused the victim william robinson of trying to 
establish an israeli settlement in south lebanon a predominatly 
shiite moslem area the israeli government and robinsons relatives 
in his home state of massachusetts denied it 
robinson 59 had since 1983 run an orphanage for handicapped 
children called the christian childrens home 
israeli troops scoured their selfproclaimed security zone in 
south lebanon for the killers who entered robinsons home in 
rashaya foukhar on tuesday night the village of 4000 is inside 
the security zone about eight miles northeast of israels border 
lebanese security sources reported that the israelis and their 
militia allies raided houses and arrested an undisclosed number of 
people 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity said the three 
attackers were armed with 9mm pistols equipped with silencers 
first they killed six german shepherds guarding the robinsons home 
the sources quoted robinsons wife barbara as telling un 
investigators the men burst into the house at about 830 pm while 
robinson his wife four sons and 26 children from the orphanage 
next door were singing bedtime prayers 
who is robinson one gunman shouted in english 
the missionary said without hesitation i am robinson 
according to mrs robinson two gunmen ordered her to take the 
children into her bedroom where one assailant tied her to a chair 
another searched the room took 4000 and jewelry the sources 
said they then tossed a sleeping gas canister into the bedroom 
knocking everyone out an hour later robinsons 7yearold son 
woke up found his fathers body in a pool of blood in the bathtub 
he had been shot in the neck and chest the sources reported 
in washington state department spokeswoman margaret tutwiler 
said the united states deplores this act of terrorism against an 
american citizen 
ms tutwiler reaffirmed the us position that the situation in 
lebanon is so dangerous for americans that passports remain 
invalid for travel to lebanon 
she said robinson had been warned on several occasions by us 
government personnel to leave lebanon he had asked twice that his 
passport be revalidated but was denied both times she said 
the lebanese communist party claimed responsibility for his 
slaying his execution brought an end to schemes to plant jewish 
settlers in south lebanon it said in a statement issued 
wednesday 
the party and its militia have carried out numerous raids on 
israeli targets including an abortive suicide truck bombing in 
southern lebanon on april 21 1985 
another claim of responsibility came from the lebanese national 
resistance front an alliance of 12 leftist factions that include 
the communists it did not specify which faction killed robinson 
it accused robinson of seeking to establish an israeli 
settlement on lebanese territory the national resistance front 
is made up largely of shiite moslems 
ms tutwiler said she had no information to corroborate the 
claims that robinson was settling jews in southern lebanon 
israeli army spokesman nachman shais office said the 
allegations of plans to settle jews in south lebanon a 
predominantly shiite moslem area were totally baseless 
without any factual content israel has no intention or plans to 
establish settlements of these types within sovereign lebanese 
territory 
unlike other israelioccupied arab territories the israelis 
have not established any settlements in south lebanon they have 
occupied the security zone a 6 to 10milewide strip of land 
since withdrawing the bulk of their army from lebanon in 1985 
three years after invading 
lebanese sources who asked not to be identified said robinson 
had been involved in a dispute with villagers over land on which he 
wanted to expand the orphanage 
earlier this month villagers petitioned the lebanese government 
to prevent robinson from establishing what they claimed would be an 
israeli settlement on lebanese soil 
the petition said robinson moved into rashaya foukhars school 
immediately after the israeli army invaded lebanon in 1982 and 
that he gradually brought in relatives and israeli friends 
he seized the pine forests near rashaya foukhar and recently 
brought in israeli engineers to build houses for 100 families 
mostly jewish immigrants from the united states and sudan the 
petition alleged 
scott mcdonald an announcer with the christianrun voice of 
hope radio station said robinson wanted to build a home for 
elderly people in south lebanon 
the victims sister elnora coppolino said robinson had no 
political motives for settling in south lebanon 
when he left here they had been bombing in southern lebanon 
bombing the schools and the children were getting killed and he was 
concerned about the children said mrs coppolino speaking by 
telephone from her home in athol mass 
mrs coppolino said robinson was brought up in athol a small 
town about 50 miles from springfield she said her brother was a 
congregationalist and moved to lebanon in 1978 his work in lebanon 
was not affiliated with any particular group she said

thousands of union workers staged a 
oneday strike and marched to the capital wednesday to protest the 
governments plan to sell puerto ricos telephone company for 2 
billion 
more than 60 unions representing private and public workers took 
part in the general strike and what was the biggest protest 
demonstration in this us commonwealth in recent history 
san juans channel 24 tv station estimated the crowd at 160000 
organizers had said they expected 100000 police had no estimate 
at one point a line of marchers 10 to 15 abreast stretched for 
more than two miles from dos hermanos bridge at the entrance of the 
condado tourist district to the domed capital in colonial old san 
juan 
demonstrators many wearing bright yellow blue red and green 
union tshirts were bused into san juan from across the caribbean 
island which has 33 million inhabitants 
protesters carried banners and signs blew whistles and chanted 
slogans as they filed by the headquarters of gov rafael hernandez 
colons popular democratic party plywood protected the buildings 
glass front and police guarded the entrance 
in a televised speech later the governor called the protest 
damaging and absurd he said he would not give up his plan 
to sell the governmentowned puerto rico telephone co 
the labor and political leaders who carried out this march 
want to blackmail the government and the people he said 
hernandez colon elected to a second fouryear term in 1988 
proposed the sale in his state of the commonwealth message feb 20 
proceeds are to be used to create two perpetual funds of 1 
billion each one for education and the other for public works 
projects such as road and bridge repairs and water and sewer 
improvements 
the perpetual funds are expected to generate 85 million to 95 
million a year in interest revenues 
critics say the governor acted without proper consultation with 
opposition parties and with no assurances that jobs and employee 
benefits would be protected by a new owner 
the government acquired the telephone company from itt corp in 
1974 for 165 million it now earns 70 million a year and employs 
8000 people 
juan velez president of the communications authority employees 
union one of two unions representing 4800 telephone workers told 
a rally at the capital that legislators supporting the sale should 
be turned out of office 
the workers are not only here in defense of national patrimony 
stateowned assets but also in defense of true electional 
reform said velez 
a brief scuffle broke out when protesters surged against police 
lines at the foot of the capital steps but no injuries were 
reported otherwise the march and rally were peaceful 
the effects of the strike on the public were minimal except for 
huge traffic jams in the area of the march and rally public buses 
were idle but most schools banks government buildings and stores 
remained open 
several bomb threats including one at fort buchanan a us army 
post were reported by police but all proved false 
the national guard on tuesday moved large electricity generators 
to the governors mansion la fortaleza and the capitol in the 
event of an electricity outage

democrats on the senate banking committee 
sharply criticized president bushs nominee for top savings and 
loan regulator wednesday charging inexperience and conflicts of 
interest 
every indication i have is he doesnt know anything about the 
financial services industry said sen alan dixon dill at the 
start of a grueling 4hour confirmation hearing 
but the nominee t timothy ryan jr a former senior labor 
department official vigorously defended himself as an experienced 
administrator and tough regulator 
i think i have a reputation for moving things along ryan 
said i make things happen and i have a proven track record 
in enforcement 
president bush last thursday nominated ryan 44 to a fiveyear 
term as director of the treasury departments office of thrift 
supervision the office regulates 2600 sampls and its director sits 
on a fivemember board conducting the administrations sampl bailout 
and insuring sampl deposits 
the committee could vote on the nomination as soon as its next 
meeting april 3 
sen howard m metzenbaum dohio who is not a member of the 
committee but attended the session charged that conflicts of 
interest between the nominees public and private careers raise 
basic questions about mr ryans sense of propriety 
metzenbaum cited several aspects of ryans career after he left 
the labor department in 1983 as the departments solicitor ryan 
engineered a consent decree which installed an independent counsel 
to oversee the teamsters 4 billion central states pension fund 
he helped select former attorney general william b saxbe for 
the job ryan then left government to practice law and later saxbe 
received court permission to join ryans law firm bringing 
thousands of dollars in fees from the pension oversight contract 
in 1985 the labor department asked ryan to resign as a member 
of its employee retirement income security act advisory council 
after it discovered that he was also serving as counsel to a trade 
group the employee stock ownership association of america 
metzenbaum also criticized ryan for sitting on the council while 
a client the washington business group on health had an interest 
in issues before it he said ryan should not have advised the 
national maritime union of america on a union election the labor 
department began investigating shortly before ryan left government 
in his defense ryan said the federal judge overseeing the 
teamsters case concluded it was not improper for saxbe to join his 
firm he said he never participated in employeeowned stock matters 
while working for the advisory council did not represent the 
business group on the pension matter that came before the advisory 
board and never dealt with the labor department directly concerning 
the maritime union 
ryan also was strongly defended by sen john warner rva who 
employed him as an aide in his last three campaigns 
the president the secretary of the treasury and to some 
extent i have been involved in this nomination and were going to 
stand by this man warner said the mans tough the mans 
fair the mans honest 
however even republicans expressed concern about ryans lack of 
experience in the banking and savings and loan industries 
after the labor department post where he was responsible for 
managing 600 attorneys in washington and 16 field offices ryan 
entered private law practice with the firm of reed smith shaw amp 
mcclay he specialized in pension and employee benefit law 
what concerns me is you dont have the background or scope 
of knowledge to try to understand what is happening out there in 
the trenches said sen connie mack rfla 
despite their misgivings senators are under intense pressure to 
confirm ryan quickly because his appointment could remove a 
constitutional challenge to the administraions savings and loan 
bailout 
a federal judge in washington last week ruled that the acting 
director of the thrift office salvatore martoche and his 
predecessor m danny wall lacked the authority to close failed 
thrifts wall was never confirmed by the senate for the job 
sen donald w riegle dmich the chairman of the panel said 
he went along with the administrations request to schedule an 
early confirmation hearing but warned ryan that theres no 
guarantee he will be confirmed 
complained sen alan cranston dcalif were being sort of 
whipsawed into rushing your nomination 
some democrats also are uneasy about ryans reputation as a 
longtime republican activist he served as an aide or attorney in 
presidential campaigns for richard nixon in 1972 gerald ford in 
1976 and george bush in 1988 he was a legal counsel to ronald 
reagans 1980 transition team 
this agency will not be a political operation ryan said 
i would not be part of that i think this problem is much too big 
to be treated in a political fashion 
the hearing was attended by sampl financier charles h keating 
jr owner of the failed lincoln savings and loan association 
based in irvine calif its bailout is expected to cost 25 
billion perhaps the costliest thrift failure in the nation 
keating who was denied his request to speak to the committee 
said he did not think ryans qualifications were adequate 
i have a distinct interest here in seeing the leadership in 
this industry the best and most qualified for the job we have a 
financial interest in what happens he said

a suburban couple separated two young brothers 
they adopted in 1984 putting the older boy in an orphanage on 
christmas and forbidding him from seeing his brother a public 
guardian who sued the couple said wednesday 
its every little boys nightmare said cook county public 
guardian patrick t murphy ricks parents told him they were 
going to put him into an orphanage and they did it its like 
telling a kid youre going to send the bogey man after him and then 
doing it 
the lawsuit filed tuesday in circuit court seeks visitation 
rights for the brothers and seeks 50000 in damages for alleged 
emotional harm to rick 11 any money would be held in escrow for 
rick until he is 18 murphy said 
the couple who live in suburban bellwood adopted rick not 
his real name and his brother now 8 in august 1984 after the 
boys natural mother abandoned them 
the parents put rick in a nearby oak park orphanage last 
christmas and received approval march 9 from circuit court judge 
walter williams to surrender their parental rights to him the 
brothers never before had been separated 
the adoptive parents identified in the lawsuit only as joseph 
and pamela doe said rick did not bond to them murphy said 
the parents said rick is only out for what he can get and they 
prevented his younger brother from seeing him according to murphy 
murphy whose job as public guardian is to act on behalf of 
children such as rick said he sued instead of appealing the 
judges decision because a lawsuit would be faster and might be 
more successful 
the parents attorney mary c martin declined to discuss the 
case tuesday calls to her office wednesday were not returned 
murphy said rick is now in a temporary foster home rick blames 
himself for the separation the guardian said 
he called rick a normal kid who has never been in trouble 
with the law 
this is not a schizophrenic kid who is climbing the walls and 
throwing feces at people he said hes a normal kid 
murphy played a tape he said was rick speaking of his 
experience rick says mom and dad were talking about something 
and they said they were going to put me up for adoption i thought 
they were kidding they werent 
rick then apologizes to his brother for a fight the two had 
this is for you he said remember that day that i hurt 
your nose when i beat you up im sorry for that i didnt mean it 
i hope i get to see you again 
the lawsuit describes the parents as a middleclass couple who 
own two small businesses 
murphy said the lawsuit is unusual but only because parents 
usually dont separate adopted children 
now youve got bureaucrats and judges who say its ok he 
said

wednesday to look for ways to continue construction of north 
dakotas garrison diversion water project which the bush 
administration wants to kill 
we owe it to the people of north dakota to look at the 
alternatives lujan said after a closeddoor meeting with the 
north dakota congressional delegation 
garrison possibly the most criticized water project in the 
nation would divert missouri river water for farm irrigation and 
municipal use over the years it has been attacked as being too 
costly and environmentally unsound 
the project was scaled back under a 1986 agreement wtih 
environmental groups that sifted the focus of the project from 
irrigation to municipal water use however 800 million of the its 
1 billion price tag is still earmarked for building irrigation 
facilities 
the project is again in serious trouble on capitol hill because 
of the administrations proposal to cancel it and a recent report 
by the interior departments inspector general that the project 
probably isnt financially feasible 
the report said the farmers who would get garrison water for 
irrigation will have to pay a larger share of the construction cost 
than they can afford 
lujan said he agreed to form a working group representing the 
congressional delegation and the administration to discuss the 
options for the project 
i cant tell you now how we can resolve these issues he 
said 
because of the inspector generals report construction will 
probably have to stop at least temporarily on parts of the project 
that would supply water for irrigating farms said sen kent 
conrad dnd 
the inspector generals report is critical to the project 
because the interior department must develop an acceptable plan for 
allocating the construction costs before the government can sign a 
repayment contract with the garrison diversion conservancy district

customs officials said they foiled an attempt on 
wednesday to supply iraq with 40 usmade devices for triggering 
nuclear explosions and that three people were charged 
us and british investigators worked on the case for 18 months 
the customs and excise department in a statement named the three 
as lebanese engineer toufic fouad amyuni 37 ali ashour daghir 
49 a company director with dual iraqi and british nationality and 
export executive jeanine celestine speckman 41 a frenchwoman 
married to a briton 
the statement said they were charged under the export of 
prohibited goods control act and will appear before uxbridge 
magistrates court in west london at 10 am thursday all three 
gave addresses in or near london it added 
iraqi diplomats in london refused to comment on the case 
an investigation initiated by us customs climaxed in a freight 
shed at londons heathrow airport as an attempt was made wednesday 
morning to put the devices which may have been dummies aboard 
an iraqi airways flight to baghdad british customs officials said 
authorities said five people were arrested in and around london 
including iraqi national omar latif who was immediately served 
with a deportation order and a cypriot with a british passport who 
was released after questioning 
in washington the us customs service said sealed indictments 
had already been returned at a san diego district court 
after the arrests president bush expressed concern over the 
spread of nuclear weapons in the middle east and said in a written 
statement we again call upon nuclear suppliers to exercise 
special restraint in providing materials related to the development 
of nuclear chemical and biological weapons and intermediaterange 
missiles in this volatile area 
while avoiding direct criticism of iraq bush noted it was among 
the nations that signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty 
customs officials in london speaking on condition of anonymity 
said the devices were capacitors electrical components of the 
detonation chain of a nuclear bomb 
defense experts said it demonstrated iraqs determination to 
become a nuclear power even at the risk of being caught violating 
western bans on the export of strategic high technology 
indications emerged however that the devices deposited at 
heathrow were dummies substituted for the real hardware as part of 
the us customs operation 
british broadcasting corp tv said customs officers made the 
switch after the packages arrived from the united states at the 
beginning of the week channel 4 tv news carried an interview with 
the manufacturer of the socalled krytrons who said his company 
turned over dummies to us customs late last year 
we provided about 40 devices to the customs service and 
they were deliberately made to be inoperative said don kerr 
president of eg amp g in wellesley mass 
he indicated he did not know whether these were the devices that 
reached london saying basically we supplied these devices to 
the customs service in the united states and the subsequent 
movement of them is unknown to us 
the home office said latif was to be deported because of 
attempted breaches of legislation governing the export of 
strategic goods from the united kingdom 
bbctv showed footage of the operation that it said was shot by 
an nbc crew that was in on the investigation 
nbc reported scotland yard detectives raided the headquarters 
of what is being described as a secret iraqi nuclear procurement 
network and removed documents and other evidence 
it quoted authorities as saying the man at the top of the 
iraqi operations is ali daghir who was sent to london from baghdad 
almost two years ago 
nbc said daghir was arrested at his office shortly after the 
iraqi flight took off 
british officials made few formal statements about the incident 
us customs spokesman ed kittredge commented theyre 
sensitive about iraq and the number of british citizens there 
kittredge mentioned iraqs execution march 15 of farzad bazoft 
an iranian reporter who was working for a british newspaper 
iraq accused bazoft of spying britain reacted by withdrawing 
its ambassador from iraq and expelling some iraqis but it has been 
reluctant to let relations with baghdad worsen further more than 
10000 britons work in iraq 
the foreign office summoned the iraqi ambassador to inform him 
of the expulsion but refused to link the action to the alleged 
smuggling operation 
military experts said the devices are available only to a 
handful of major powers and their export is strictly controlled 
they recalled two previous smuggling attempts one involving israel 
and the other pakistan both of which have nuclear weapons 
ambitions 
iraqi president saddam hussein is known to harbor ambitions of 
eclipsing egypt and syria as the premier military power of the arab 
world in 1981 israeli warplanes bombed an iraqi nuclear reactor 
claiming it was designed to make bombs lately iraq has developed 
longrange missiles thought to be capable of delivering a nuclear 
warhead 
professor paul wilkinson a bradford university terrorism 
expert said if theyre trying to smuggle in these highly 
sophisticated trigger devices that means theyre very serious 
about making nuclear weapons and soon

prime minister margaret thatcher underlined the 
need for restraint on all sides in the lithuania crisis during a 
50minute telephone conversation wednesday with soviet president 
mikhail gorbachev her office said 
the phone call arranged in advance through diplomatic contacts 
was timed to precede mrs thatchers meetings thursday and friday 
with west german chancellor helmut kohl in britain and with 
president bush in bermuda on april 13 
mrs thatchers office gave no details on gorbachevs response 
on lithuania but said she emphasized the need for restraint and 
negotiations and expressed hope the crisis could be settled in a 
way suitable to both sides 
the people of lithuania have made clear their wish to 
determine their own future mrs thatcher said to the house of 
commons tuesday 
she said britain had never recognized the 1940 soviet annexation 
of lithuania though it was recognized in fact in the 35nation 
helsinki accords in 1975 
undoubtedly that is a very difficult situation both for 
president gorbachev and for the people of lithuania mrs 
thatcher said 
i believe that it calls for great restraint on both sides 
force is not an appropriate way to settle the position i hope it 
will be settled by restraint on both sides and by their discussing 
it so that they come to a satisfactory conclusion 
that view was also taken by the 12 foreign secretaries of the 
european community she said 
mrs thatchers spokesman who by custom was not identified 
said the conversation also covered other world events including 
the east german elections prospects for german unification and 
the prime ministers visit to kiev in june

rep george w crockett jr dmich a fiery 
champion of liberal causes for nearly five decades and defense 
lawyer for communist party members in a celebrated 1949 trial 
wednesday announced his retirement 
after 68 years of working im hoping to enjoy a little time 
off the 80yearold chairman of the foreign affairs subcommittee 
on western hemisphere affairs said in a brief floor speech 
announcing that he will not seek a sixth term 
crockett had announced his candidacy for reelection but faced 
at least two challengers for the democratic nomination in his 
heavily democratic detroit district 
he said in an interview the prospect of stiff opposition did not 
influence his change of heart ive just gotten older and 
wiser he said 
crockett recently became the first member of congress to 
advocate decriminalizing drug use the latest of many stands that 
have outraged conservatives and even made some fellow liberals 
uneasy 
born and reared in jacksonville fla he earned a law degree at 
the university of michigan and was an attorney with the justice 
department and the united auto workers union 
judging by his courtly demeanor and mild manners it might be 
hard to believe crocketts fiery past 
in 1949 crockett gained national attention for his spirited 
defense of 11 communists charged with subversion in new york his 
clashes with the presiding federal judge harold medina earned him 
and four other defense lawyers a fourmonth prison sentence for 
contempt of court 
he was elected judge in the detroit recorders court which 
handles criminal cases in 1966 and served 12 years he was elected 
to congress in 1980 
as chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee he opposed 
the reagan administrations central american policies especially 
its support of the nicaraguan rebels 
he was jailed overnight in 1984 after demonstrating outside the 
south african embassy 
hes not a person constantly seeking votes or trying to get 
before the media or particularly concerned with what the polls tell 
him is the popular position said a democratic colleague from 
michigan john conyers said hes always been his own man 
he has been a gentleman and despite the fullness of his years 
hes been a very active chairman of an important subcommittee 
said rep henry hyde rill a member of the western hemisphere 
panel

52 years said brynhild haugland 84 her retirement becomes 
effective this december following an election in november 
the minot republican first elected in 1938 modestly referred 
to herself as the least of the least 
i just tried to do my best miss haugland said serving in 
the house has been a joy 
but legislative colleagues said miss hauglands gentle demeanor 
and unflashy style masked political shrewdness and a steely will to 
prevail on issues she held dear 
shes a political genius said republican colleague rep 
janet wentz she was never wasteful with her power she knew when 
to use it 
miss haugland is the nations longestserving state lawmaker 
said bill pound director of the national conference of state 
legislatures a denverbased research group 
miss haugland recalled the old days those spittoons would 
always rattle she said people would inevitably kick them 
rep rod larson who was vice chairman of miss hauglands human 
services and veterans affairs committee in the last two sessions 
said the lawmaker had a knack for doing things in a quiet way 
miss haugland was chairwoman of the committee for 23 of the 26 
sessions she served in the legislature which meets in oddnumbered 
years and is not in session 
she just knew what she wanted to do and she was very 
upfront larson said she wouldnt worry about the popularity 
or unpopularity of things 
if she didnt like somebody she didnt mince words either

a federal jury on wednesday convicted an 
alexandria man on conspiracy charges in a plot to kidnap torture 
and murder a young boy for production of a pornographic snuff 
movie 
though no youngster was ever actually kidnapped the us 
district court jury of eight women and four men found that there 
was enough evidence to convict daniel t depew on two charges of 
conspiracy 
depew 28 faces up to life in prison and will be sentenced may 
27 by judge ts ellis iii 
the conviction ended 2 days of testimony and evidence in which 
violent acts were discussed in lurid detail and the lifestyles of 
sadomastochistic homosexuals was revealed in court 
assistant us attorney michael smythers questioned defense 
attorney james lowes assertion that the defendant never intended 
to carry out the plan 
which child are we going to turn over to him to test to see 
if he would do it smythers asked the jury 
depew testified at length on tuesday and wednesday claiming 
that he was too intimidated to get out of the plot and said it was 
a fantasy 
during cross examination by prosecutors the defendant also 
admitted that he had engaged in violent homosexual activities at 
the age of 12 
he also said that the sexual activities described throughout the 
trial were enjoyable to him but that he was not attracted to 
young boys 
what appeared to be a damning piece of evidence presented on 
wednesday was a video tape depew made with his lover dean lambey 
in which he described a person who wanted to kill boys while a 
video camera panned a playground 
another video tape shown to the jury on tuesday depicted violent 
sex between the lovers 
smythers said in his closing summation that the video would 
have been enough to gag a maggot 
prosecutors said depew and his partner were arrested before they 
could carry out the plan which police officers contend was real 
depew tesified that he talked to lambey about the plan because 
he wanted him as a sexual partner 
during the investigation police established a longdistance 
computer relationship with the men through a computer bulletin 
board for pedophiles 
lambey pleaded guilty last fall and is serving a 30year 
sentence

thousands of ethnic albanians in 
kosovo peacefully protested wednesday on the first anniversary of 
constitutional changes that curbed the autonomy of their troubled 
region 
throughout the province for two hours beginning at noon 
streets in towns and villages were almost empty as ethnic albanians 
stayed indoors to protest 
the constitutional amendments gave serbia the largest yugoslav 
republic near total control over kosovo where ethnic albanians 
comprise 90 percent of the 19 million population 
with this silent protest we want to mark a year of repressive 
and brutal policy which has to the extreme curtailed our human 
rights said a statement by newly formed independent ethnic 
albanian groups that called the protest 
march 28 was proclaimed a holiday in serbia and was celebrated 
with public festivities 
kosovos communist party president rahman morina told the 
associated press the ruling party will allow free elections in 
kosovo and may open a dialogue with some the new groups in the 
province 
western human rights monitors speaking to reporters in 
belgrade stressed however that violence has increased in kosovo 
since january and dialogue seems distant 
karl schwarzenberg chief of the viennabased international 
helsinki federation said after touring kosovo that mass arrests 
there of ethnic albanians constitute a frightening example of the 
power of a oneparty dictatorship 
about 60 ethnic albanians demanding the return of autonomy have 
died in clashes with security forces in kosovo since the 
constitutional changes were passed a year ago 
thousands have been arrested and jailed for separatist and 
terrorist activities that serbian authorities say are aimed at 
taking kosovo out from yugoslavia to join neighboring communist 
albania 
serbia says the constitutional changes were needed to protect 
minority serbs in kosovo from harassment by ethnic albanians 
heavily armed serbian police who last week took full control in 
kosovo patrolled towns in the region frequently checking identity 
cards of pedestrians searching cars and sometimes arresting people 
veton suroi a leading ethnic albanian activist and a leader of 
a coalition of newly formed independent groups said we think 
street protest cannot solve kosovos problems the street protests 
can only provide an excuse for more repression

medical experts said wednesday they were 
puzzled by reports that tranquilizers revived a man whod spent 
eight years in a vegetative state 
this is so bizarre dr catherine bontke of the institute 
for rehabilitation and research in houston said in a telephone 
interview it just doesnt make sense it doesnt fit anything i 
know 
but the patients doctor warned that the case was an isolated 
one that should not be automatically applied to similar cases 
it makes me nervous that people are going to see this as a 
possibility for treating such patients said dr andres kanner a 
university of wisconsin neurologist 
i think we are getting excited prematurely he told a news 
conference every patient is different why this happened with 
this patient we dont know 
since the case was reported tuesday the university has received 
inquiries about it from around the world said university hospital 
and clinics spokeswoman priscilla arsove 
kanner reported tuesday that a 45yearold man was awakened 
after being injected with valium during a routine dental procedure 
march 12 the man has been awakened several times since kanner 
said 
the patient a former airline pilot was injured in a car 
accident 10 years ago he was in a coma for about three months 
then improved but lapsed into a vegetative state about eight years 
ago kanner said 
the patient whose identity was withheld at family request was 
being cared for in a nursing home when the drug was administered 
the doctor said 
the patient is being observed at the hospital and doctors are 
experimenting to find the dose of tranquilizers that would allow 
the man who is married and has children to leave the hospital and 
return home kanner said 
when medicated the man can remain fully conscious for up to 12 
hours at a time the neurologist said on the day he was first 
revived the man was able to walk talk and perform complicated 
math calculations kanner said 
when not treated with the medication the man returns to the 
vegetativelike state kanner said wednesday 
the patient remained in that state wednesday at the hospital 
while doctors experimented with oral administration of the drugs 
he said but that procedure so far has not had the same effect as 
when they were injected and the man woke up 
doctors plan to continue experimenting for a few weeks and if 
no progress is made they will reevaluate the situation 
continuous injections of the tranquilizing drugs has its 
risks including depression of the respiratory system or the 
heart kanner said 
a vegetative state is different from a coma because vegetative 
state patients have sleeping and waking patterns often open their 
eyes and sometimes utter words experts said 
kanner said wednesday the man was in a vegetativelike state 
rather than a true vegetative state 
the man had some reactions that would not be characteristic of 
someone in a permanent vegetative state kanner said for example 
the man would sometimes pull his arm away when someone tried to 
give him an injection he said 
experts said the mans reaction should stimulate research and 
cause doctors to reexamine some of their patients but it probably 
wouldnt have a significant immediate effect on medical practices 
it must cause caregivers to be more cautious said dr 
richard foa of washington a member of the american academy of 
neurologys ethics and humanity subcommittee but an anecdote 
like this wouldnt alter my practice 
foa said the vegetative state has been studied in recent years 
as specialists try to narrow its definition 
usually a persistent vegetative state patient is given that 
prognosis after six months to a year many doctors believe the 
condition justifies the removal of lifesupport systems foa said 
the immediate question that arises is was this individual 
properly diagnosed foa said 
still the madison case will raise questions when doctors 
consider withdrawing lifesupport systems foa said but it 
shouldnt lead to fundamental changes in the care given he said 
the case should be meticulously documented foa added 
kanner declined to comment wednesday on his colleagues 
opinions except to say that doctors at his hospital have not 
concluded why the drugs help the man 
kanner said tuesday that one theory is that benzodiazepines 
such as valium and barbituates inhibit certain nervous system 
functions and may have blocked the effects of the vegetative state 
but dr nathan zasler a member of the medical college of 
virginia in richmond said drugs such as valium typically would 
have a worsening effect on vegetative state patients 
there are no reports that i am aware of where valium was used 
to wake people up zasler said typically what we would find 
is that it would make them worse rather than better in terms of 
arousal 
lots of people are misdiagnosed zasler said to me this 
sounds really bizarre but im not saying it cant happen 
there were about 10000 persistent vegetative state patients in 
the united states in 1988 according to the american academy of 
neurology in minneapolis

the idaho house approved legislation 
wednesday to make idaho the 47th state with a holiday honoring 
slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr 
the house voted 5327 for the bill previously passed by the 
senate later the senate accepted a house amendment that made the 
holidays complete name martin luther king jridaho human rights 
day 
final approval by the senate was expected thursday before the 
bill goes to gov cecil andrus who proposed the holiday 
the bill was the subject of tortuous arguments in the 
legislature last week opponents said their constituents didnt 
care about martin luther king 
were told this isnt a black holiday but yet were also told 
we cant change the name said rep stan hawkins a republican 
if you really have a guilt trip in mind by passing this youre 
making a mistake 
rep l ed brown also a republican and one of the bills 
sponsors said the decision on the bill would say more about 
idaho than about martin luther king 
idaho is not the state in the union thats going to determine 
martin luther kings greatness brown said fortysix states 
and the federal government have already done that 
brown said adopting a king holiday would send a very special 
message to future generations about how idahoans feel about 
minorities 
besides idaho only arizona montana and new hampshire have not 
adopted state holidays corresponding with the federal holiday 
honoring king on the third monday in january 
the idaho legislature created a state commemorative day in 1987 
and a bill creating a state holiday died in a house committee last 
year despite arguments its failure would only reinforce the 
perception some have of idaho as a haven for racists 
opponents said they objected to another day off for government 
employees proponents said idahos economy would suffer through 
lost tourism and convention business if it failed to establish the 
holiday

the military government has arrested a 
number of civilians and military officers for planning to stage a 
coup the official sudan news agency reported wednesday 
it quoted an unidentified military official as saying those 
arrested were planning a limited movement to achieve subversive 
objectives 
the situation is contained and an investigation has begun with 
those involved the military official said 
he said lt gen omar hassan elbashirs government had been 
monitoring their activities for four months but gave no details on 
the number of detainees or when they were arrested 
he said they included abdulrahman farrah a retired navy 
officer and a former security adviser to the disbanded umma party 
the military official indicated the others also belonged to the 
disbanded umma and communist parties 
he said the two parties had joined 10 others and 31 trade unions 
last october in signing a secret document called the national 
democratic alliance charter 
the charter calls for the overthrow of elbashir who seized 
power in a military coup on june 30 and outlines steps to convene 
a constitutional conference to end the 7yearold civil war in the 
south 
elbashir dissolved all political parties trade unions and 
professional associations after the coup 
sudanese sources in the egyptian capital cairo said that in 
the past week members of the disbanded parties had amended some 
points of the charter at the request of the rebel sudan peoples 
liberation army 
they said the changes included a stipulation that the 
constitutional conference be held within six months of the 
overthrow of elbashir and that sudanese and rebel troops be 
combined into a single force once the war ends 
a rebel delegation arrived in cairo last week and met with 
president hosni mubarak on tuesday 
the rebels took up arms against the government in 1983 
demanding greater autonomy and administrative and economic reforms 
in the south

a poll of nearly 2500 soviets found them far 
from united on how to reshape their society and often divided along 
ethnic lines in their views of religion the red army and the 
communist party 
the survey released wednesday by former president carters 
public policy center found a sharp divergence on the role of 
government the traditional communist notion that the state is 
responsible for everyones wellbeing was favored by 46 percent 
but 45 percent said individuals should rely on themselves 
many of those who want rapid change to solve social problems 
also hold the state responsible for individual wellbeing wrote 
poll analyst ada finifter a michigan state university political 
science professor 
thus it is likely that there will be shifting and unstable 
majorities for various reform efforts 
george gerbner of the university of pennsylvania said half of 
the respondents believe most people cannot be trusted and the poor 
have only themselves to blame for their predicament sixty percent 
agreed that most people in the soviet union are indifferent to the 
fate of others 
with millions likely to be out of jobs when the convulsion 
runs its full course this will add to the volatility of the 
situation gerbner said 
the national center for public opinion research in moscow helped 
direct the poll with american researchers from the the university 
of pennsylvania michigan state and the carter center which is 
affiliated with emory university 
pollsters conducted 90minute interviews with 2485 soviet 
citizens in their homes last november and december no margin of 
error was given carter called it the firstever definitive poll 
conducted in the soviet union 
the opinions of many respondents appeared largely influenced not 
by their age education or communist party membership but by the 
minority groups they belong to the pollsters said the soviet 
census identifies more than 100 national groups usually identified 
by their language 
future soviet policies will have to take into account that on 
the most fundamental and deeply felt questions the peoples of the 
soviet union inhabit vastly different worlds wrote ellen 
mickiewicz a carter center fellow and political science professor 
at emory 
however 72 percent of those polled opposed allowing a 
dissemination of opinion advocating superiority of one nationality 
over another 
just 1 percent of residents in the baltic republics and 6 
percent of georgians agreed that the soviet army always acted in 
the peoples interests compared with 26 percent of central asians 
and 29 percent of russians the poll showed 
fortytwo percent of georgians said the communist party never 
makes decisions serving the public compared with 6 percent of 
central asians 
sixtynine percent of respondents from moslemdominated georgia 
agreed that religious institutions acted in the peoples best 
interests compared with 44 percent of baltic residents 39 percent 
of russians and 20 percent of central asians the poll showed 
the church has played a more active role in trying to moderate 
during the recent civil strife in georgia ms mickiewicz said 
nationally just 26 percent of communist party members polled 
expressed full confidence in the party and 12 percent expressed no 
confidence the poll showed 
fiftyfour percent of soviets defended free speech even at the 
cost of political disorder while 37 percent said public order 
should be more important 
only 11 percent of the respondents said they agreed with the 
old order precept of strict income equality and 84 percent 
want to permit varying incomes pollsters said

a college student accused of drowning her 
newborn in a dormitory toilet murdered the child because he was an 
inconvenience prosecutors said wednesday in opening arguments 
tears rolled down the cheeks of 18yearold claire moritt as 
assistant state attorney joan richardson denied the defenses 
contention that ms moritt had gone temporarily insane 
this is a girl who chooses to deny or replace those things she 
feels are unpleasant said ms richardson when she could not 
wish this baby away could not deny it she killed it 
if convicted of firstdegree murder the hillsborough community 
college student from hollywood would automatically be sent to 
prison for life with no chance of parole for 25 years 
the jury also could decide ms moritt is guilty of a lesser 
degree of homicide 
in graphic detail attorneys recounted how the early morning 
darkness of oct 23 was punctuated by the cries of a baby in ms 
moritts highrise dormitory suite 
when the cries continued roommates pounded on her bathroom door 
and demanded to know what was wrong ms moritt replied she was not 
feeling well 
once inside they found ms moritt naked on her knees and 
surrounded by blood they took her to the hospital and returned to 
find the 6pound 9ounce baby boy swathed in a sheet facedown 
in the toilet 
the prosecution called two of ms moritts dormitory suite 
mates who described helping their bleeding friend down three 
flights of stairs to take her to the hospital and returning to 
find the baby 
prosecutors characterized the defendant as an upper middleclass 
child who was spoiled and preoccupied with what others thought of 
her 
claire is not unlike women you hear about who give birth 
to healthy babies and throw them in a trash dump to get rid of 
them ms richardson told the jury but she didnt make it to 
the trash dump 
there were too many people around in a panic she had to do 
something and she chose to wrap that baby in sheets and stuff it 
headfirst in a toilet 
defense attorney b anderson mitcham described his client as a 
good student who had never been in trouble before and only 
realized she had given birth when told by a social worker at the 
hospital 
ms moritt never realized she was pregnant maintained her 
normal weight and had regular menstrual periods mitcham said 
adding that she still has no recollection of going into labor or 
giving birth 
the defense attorney said 10 psychologists and psychiatrists who 
examined ms moritt found she was temporarily insane at the time of 
the birth suffering from a dissociative disorder in which she 
refused to acknowledge the pregnancy 
in simple terms she could not adhere to whats right and she 
could not refrain from whats wrong mitcham said 
mitcam also implied that the child found in the toilet may not 
have been dead when he was found the newborn was taken to the 
hospital in a sealed plastic bag but doctors spent a halfhour 
trying to revive the infant he said

the sister of an american missionary 
killed by masked assassins at his home in lebanon said wednesday 
she is watching the news waiting by the telephone and trying to 
get in touch with his wife 
i would like to know that the children are all right said 
elnora coppolino elder sister of slain missionary william 
robinson i would like to know if she wants to go home now i 
would like to see them come home 
two lebanese extremist groups wednesday claimed responsibility 
for robinsons assassination saying they were trying to prevent 
him from establishing an israeli settlement in south lebanon 
mrs coppolino said her brother a congregationalist was only 
interested in running his 7yearold orphanage the christian 
childrens home for disabled children 
he had a very strong faith in the lord and he thought it was 
gods will that they go over there and do what they could for those 
people whatever happened would be gods will mrs coppolino 
said in a telephone interview from her home in athol about 50 
miles north of springfield 
she said she had no inkling that her brother was not welcomed by 
his neighbors 
he said they were very friendly i have lots of reports that 
came back from different people i have copies of letters that are 
written in arabic and different things about the good work that 
hes done over there she said 
she said robinson began by opening a home for orphans and later 
took in children who were disabled or injured 
family members worried about robinsons safety but he was 
determined to stay she said 
when he left here they had been bombing in southern lebanon 
bombing the schools and the children were getting killed and he was 
concerned about the children mrs coppolino said 
the assassins broke into robinsons house tuesday night while he 
was singing bedtime prayers with his american wife four sons and 
26 other children from his orphanage lebanese security sources 
told un investigators 
the robinsons had last written home in february with a letter 
from robinsons wife barbara 
she said bill is good busy every day she said there was a 
lot of fighting in the north of them and sometimes some of the 
shells came down that way but thats not unusual they were all 
ok mrs coppolino said 
robinson 59 was brought up in athol and served four years in 
the marines his sister said he studied electronics in the service 
and worked on television cable systems in athol and pittsfield 
before moving to california and illinois 
because he could not get a visa robinson entered lebanon from 
israel in 1978 mrs coppolino said 
she said he worked for two years to support the orphanage he 
founded in 1983 but for the last five years had relied on 
donations from several countries including italy and norway 
mrs coppolino said marine col richard higgins who later was

a 6yearold boy who underwent a lung transplant 
eight days ago died from a bacterial infection wednesday a 
hospital spokesman said 
danny beard died at 1118 am after his immune system rejected 
the lung he received in an operation march 20 at the childrens 
hospital said spokesman phil lotane 
the boys parents william and kathryn beard were at his 
bedside when he died 
the boy had been in critical condition since the operation and 
had been hooked to a lung machine since feb 25 when a mysterious 
virus attacked his lungs 
a bacterial infection started in dannys bloodstream and spread 
through his body said dr james fackler director of the 
hospitals multidisciplinary intensive care unit 
with any organ transplant the body recognizes the new organ 
as foreign fackler said in a statement we had to go to 
extraordinary lengths to suppress dannys reaction to his new 
lung 
antirejection drugs often leave transplant patients more 
susceptible to infection 
the hospital said last week that the donor was a child from new 
england but gave no other details

a handwritten manuscript crisscrossed by 
revisions has yielded a previously unpublished short story by 
ernest hemingway that probably was his last the professor who 
deciphered the work said wednesday 
its very exciting said donald junkins who teaches english 
at the university of massachusetts im positive that this is the 
last short story that hemingway ever wrote 
junkins titled the story after the first five words of the 
manuscript philip haines was a writer 
solving the riddle was a painstaking process that began two 
years ago when junkins began studying two handwritten manuscripts 
that were among hemingway papers given to the john f kennedy 
library in boston in 1980 he discovered one was the beginnings of 
a novel that was scrapped the second used the same plot for a 
short story 
decoding the revisions scrawled all over the papers took hours 
junkins said 
the professor said he picked up on clues to the story while on 
vacation in bimini the setting of hemingways islands in the 
stream a book about a painter called thomas hudson 
as i wrote and as i kept writing i knew that i had a story but 
i didnt know if i had an ending thats the big thing that was 
the exciting part of it junkins said 
i was swimming on thomas hudsons beach here i am and ive 
got this story he said i just went very slowly 
the story is scheduled for publication in the april issue of 
the hemingway review published by the english department of 
ohio northern university 
were pleased with ourselves but you cant blame us said 
editor charles oliver who enjoyed the new story although unlike 
junkins he didnt think it was one of hemingways best its a 
lot of fun to be able to publish a new hemingway short story even 
though we know it isnt as good as his best work 
it really does tell a fascinating story about the writer we 
really see his mind at work oliver said 
also in the new issue is a second unpublished work of 
hemingways an incomplete story called a lack of passion that 
was researched by susan beegel an independent scholar who lives on 
nantucket island oliver said 
beegel said she went looking for the 1920s story about a 
frightened bullfighter in pamplona spain after finding a 
reference to the story in the nonfiction work death in the 
afternoon 
beegel said the story is remarkable because it deals with a 
frightened impotent character as opposed to the macho heroes who 
people hemingways bestknown works 
its going to help change the way people think about 
hemingway she said 
hemingway who killed himself with a shotgun in idaho in 1961 
won a nobel prize for literature 
the haines story is set in paris and explores how the title 
character throws away a marriage for a doomed relationship 
junkins said hemingway started to write a novel on that theme 
but then stalled 
its a man who is in the process of divorcing his wife and 
his girlfriend has gone back to america to wait out the divorce and 
he cant write junkins said 
the 31page short story apparently had been mistaken for an 
earlier version of the unfinished novel junkins said 
the material appears to date from about 1959 toward the end of 
hemingways life said junkins who matched cafe descriptions with 
those in the vignettes that were posthumously published as a 
moveable feast 
junkins said he believes there are several reasons why hemingway 
did not finish the novel 
for one thing all the tension in the story comes from the 
fact that in the novel the girl in america will not come back to 
paris the point is if she comes back whats going to happen the 
novel cannot go anywhere the way he set it up

cold fusion equipment used by a university of utah 
chemist who claimed to harness the power of the sun in a lab jar 
didnt produce any nuclear energy said a physicist at the school 
who tested the apparatus 
we did not see a peep said michael h salamon who measured 
the nuclear output of cold fusion gear in the lab of stanley pons 
for five weeks 
there was not an iota not a sniff of conventional fusion 
occurring we saw no neutrons or gamma rays that could be 
attributed to a fusion process 
his findings appear to be another blow to the already widely 
questioned announcement last march of a revolutionary new source of 
energy 
but one backer of cold fusion said the new findings fail to 
prove anything because pons equipment was not working properly 
when salamon tested it 
salamon said his measurements published in thursdays issue of 
the british journal nature were made at pons invitation he 
conducted the tests last may and june about two months after pons 
and martin fleischman of the university of southampton in england 
announced they achieved fusion at room temperature in simple 
laboratory equipment 
pons responded its pretty distressing because most of the 
allegations in the paper are not true 
in a telephone interview wednesday from salt lake city pons 
said the physicists ignored energy cells that were producing large 
amounts of heat and instead set up their monitoring equipment to 
check ones that were making only low amounts he said the sensors 
were also placed at an angle that missed evidence of nuclear 
activity 
pons said salamons team was in the laboratory for political 
reaons 
they were embarrassed by this he said they were 
embarrassed that a chemist had fallen into a nuclear reaction so 
simply their outside colleagues were putting tremendous pressure 
on them 
pons also accused nature of trying to undermine his work by 
publishing negative studies while ignoring supporting evidence 
others however viewed salamons paper as one more reason to be 
skeptical 
its another nail in the coffin commented ronald parker 
director of the plasma fusion center at massachusetts institute of 
technology they did a very careful search for fusion effects 
and they came up empty 
fritz g will director of the statefunded national cold fusion 
institute at the university of utah said small changes in 
experimental conditions including humidity can affect whether or 
not pons fusion cells produce heat 
at the time salamon checked the equipment for signs of fusion 
will said experimental conditions prevailing in those 
experiments were not suitable to finding the phenomenon 
pons equipment consisted of a palladium electrode wrapped in 
platinum and immersed in a flask of deuterium oxide or heavy 
water when electricity is run through the metals proponents say 
deuterium atoms fuse giving off more heat than the energy put in 
nuclear fusion powers the stars traditionally scientists have 
believed that fusion could occur only at extremely high 
temperatures cool smallscale fusion would provide a convenient 
limitless source of power and be one of the greatest scientific 
discoveries of all time 
pons and fleischmans seeming breakthrough was questioned when 
researchers in other labs had trouble duplicating their results 
while many scientists say they doubt cold fusion exists 
experiments continue at labs around the world 
cold fusion if it occurs is likely to produce heat extra 
tritium and specific patterns of neutron and gamma ray releases 
known as nuclear signatures 
ninteyfive percent of those researchers who have tried to 
find anomalous effects whether excess heat or nuclear signatures 
have come up emptyhanded will said 
the mere fact that a large percentage of scientists have 
failed to confirm does not mean that the phenomenon that has been 
confirmed by 5 percent is incorrect the burden is on those who 
havent found it to change their experimental conditions so they 
find it also he said 
will said 20 labs experimenting with cold fusion have produced 
excess heat about a dozen have found large tritium counts and at 
least a handful have seen signs of neutron release 
salamon set up sensors for gamma rays that would be discharged 
when neutrons produced by the nuclear process hit the water bath 
that surrounded the fusion cells 
salamon said he had planned to study pons records of heat 
produced by his fusion cells to see how they matched up with the 
detection of gamma rays however he said pons later refused to 
turn over the records 
during the five weeks of study salamons equipment was out of 
service for a twohour period because a lightning strike knocked 
out the power 
salamon said pons later told him that the fusion cells produced 
excess heat during this time however salamon said he could find 
no residual signs of a neutron burst that would have lingered for 
several days

the state senate on wednesday approved an 
overhaul of the school system funded with a 126 billion tax 
increase that is designed to boost kentuckys ailing schools into 
the nations front ranks 
the bill is a do or die effort for elementary and secondary 
education in this state said majority floor leader joe wright a 
driving force behind its passage 
the 946page bill which would repeal and rewrite all kentucky 
laws dictating how public schools are run passed by a 308 vote 
it goes back to the house where it originated for action on 
senate amendments 
gov wallace wilkinson elected in 1987 on an education 
platform said the 1990 general assembly would leave a legacy of 
education reform 
for once well be able to point to something other than a 
basketball team and say were no 1 said sen nelson allen 
chairman of the senate education committee 
most of the programs foreseen in the bill can be found in 
various school districts around the country 
but passage of the bill would provide the only statewide school 
system that draws together an array of motivational programs that 
provide special help for problem children and reward schools 
performances said david hornbeck a washington dc consultant 
who was one of the bills main architects 
kentucky currently ranks near the bottom in most educational 
categories 
the legislation was produced under pressure of a state supreme 
court ruling last year that kentuckys school system was 
unconstitutional because children in poor counties were denied a 
quality education 
the bill would pump millions into the states poorest districts 
increase teacher pay and provide cash rewards for improving schools 
while punishing those with declining standards 
schools would be judged by the success of their students and 
given regulatory freedom to reach their goals control of the 
system would shift from an elected state superintendent to an 
appointed education commissioner 
the new system would emphasize early childhood education 
eliminate graded classrooms until the fourth grade and target 
potential dropouts for extra help 
if the general assembly gives the new system time to work 
refraining from changes for six to eight years i earnestly 
believe we can make a total reform of the school system said 
david karem a democratic sponsor of the bill 
the bill would be financed out of a penny increase in the sales 
tax rate elimination of several individual incometax deductions 
and a 1 percent hike in corporate income taxes 
the senate amended the bill to eliminate the state deduction for 
federal tax payments the house version would have phased it out 
granting a 2000 deduction for 1990 and 1000 for 1991 
no one likes taxes but we all like education said sen pat 
mccuiston a leading democrat we all realize the necessity of it 
and therefore we have to pass the financing that goes along with 
this school package 
republican floor leader john rogers voted against the bill and 
predicted retribution at the polls the taxpaying voter will 
never forget what you did to him here said rogers a republican

the government said wednesdays armed 
strike called by maoist rebels was a flop but transportation 
snarls cropped up throughout the capital when bus drivers stayed 
home in fear of guerrilla reprisals 
at least 20 bombings rocked lima overnight including three car 
bombings as the shining path movement stepped up its violence in 
an attempt to frighten peruvians into boycotting national elections 
scheduled for april 8 
government labor and business representatives contacted by the 
associated press said most workers showed up for work but no 
figures were available 
the armed strike was a complete failure labor minister 
wilfredo chau said 
private bus drivers bowed to rebel threats and stayed off the 
streets however causing serious public transportation backups 
thousands of workers trying to reach their jobs lined up to catch 
the few public buses operating 
an armed strike is a general strike called by the rebels that 
carries the threat of violence against those who ignore it 
the last armed strike took place nov 3 nine days before 
nationwide municipal elections it did not receive much support 
although bus drivers stayed off the streets in the early hours of 
the strike 
bomb explosions hit police stations banks campaign offices and 
other targets around the capital during tuesday night police 
reported one person injured and extensive damage 
officers said two other car bombs were deactivated tuesday 
night including one set to go off at limas international airport 
david quintana president of a private bus drivers union said 
tuesday night that many drivers received written death threats at 
their homes from the guerrillas 
he said drivers were ready to stay off the streets on election 
day if the government did not provide protection 
the government issued a decree wednesday giving a twohour grace 
period to workers who arrived late due to the bus shortage 
last week the government put perus 80000 police on alert and 
declared a state of emergency in the capital due to guerrilla 
violence 
the decree came after rebels killed four congressional 
candidates in five days 
more than half of perus 22 million people live in areas 
affected by states of emergency including limas 7 million 
residents 
shining path began fighting perus elected governments in 1980 
the government says more than 18000 people have died in the 
violence

a federal judge wednesday refused to block the 
scheduled execution next week of a man who murdered two teenagers 
bringing him one step closer to becoming the first person executed 
in california in 23 years 
barring a lastminute stay robert alton harris 37 would go to 
the gas chamber tuesday 
not only do i decline to intervene but i myself have 
concluded that this defendant has had his day in court like no 
other defendant us district judge william b enright said 
after hearing arguments by harris attorneys and state prosecutors 
citizens of this state are entitled to due process also they 
deserve no more than that but they deserve not one bit less 
enright said capital punishment is the law of this state it has 
been repeatedly validated by the citizens of this state 
if the courts are to have any validity at all they must be 
capable of instituting final judgment he said 
defense attorneys charles sevilla and michael mccabe said they 
would renew their appeal by filing a petition in the us 9th 
circuit court of appeals in san francisco on thursday morning 
should that petition fail the final avenue remaining would be 
the us supreme court which has denied harris appeals four times 
enright said he had reviewed papers filed in the case as well 
as the transcript of harris 1979 trial penalty phase and appeals 
he said he found nothing to uphold defense attorneys claims that 
harris received inadequate defense counsel or that psychiatric 
experts examining harris gave incompetent evaluations 
at every critical point the defendant was given the 
benefit enright said facts are facts facts are the bedrock 
of any trial and the facts in this case are egregious 
the judge while praising mccabe and sevilla for their 
determined litigation efforts said he was disturbed they had 
resorted to attacking the professionalism and competency of harris 
trial attorney as well as some psychiatric experts 
enright said his review of the record showed just the opposite 
and cited harris own statements agreeing that he had received 
excellent representation from his trial attorney thomas ryan 
in arguments preceding the judges decision sevilla claimed the 
defense had been denied state funds to hire psychiatric experts to 
pursue their theory that brain damage contributed to the violent 
behavior that culminated in the july 1978 shootings of john mayeski 
and michael baker both 16 
harris had abducted the boys at gunpoint from a drivein 
restaurant as they sat in their parked cars he forced them to 
drive to a remote area where he shot them so he could use their car 
in a bank robbery 
sevilla also claimed that harris abusive childhood and his 
mothers heavy drinking during her pregnancy with him exacerbated 
harris mental disorders sevilla challenged the evaluation of a 
state mental health expert who characterized harris as a sociopath 
incapable of remorse or rehabilitation 
deputy attorney general louis hanoian said there was nothing new 
in the petition and that all the issues raised in it had been fully 
litigated 
theyve just slapped a new label on it he said

mailbags stuffed with fainting brides 
singing dogs polkadancing chickens and raids into the privacy of 
the shower arrive daily at the busy shop that produces abcs 
surprise hit americas funniest home videos 
programmers and analysts of what the television audience wants 
to see are agog at the reaction to the halfhour sunday show 
which has host bob saget introducing and narrating clips from home 
videos sent in by viewers 
network television which has lost viewers steadily over the 
past decade due in part to the advent of videocassettes has found 
a way to bite back 
the midseason replacement series reached no 1 in the ac 
nielsen ratings for the second week of march and a onehour rerun 
special knocked venerable 60 minutes out of the top 10 slot it 
also has mugged murder she wrote 
in the cramped warren of rooms at abc where americans 
funniest home videos is made executive producer vic di bona 
oversees a hustling young staff of 70 
they have learned this wearyeyed crew some amazing trivia 
about america 
there are still plenty of outhouses in this country just 
waiting for someone with a camcorder to kick open the door and 
astound the occupant and spouses like to surprise each other in 
the shower with a video camera 
there also are more folks than you realize who can make their 
bunchedup bellybuttons whistle out a tune 
nearly every kid in the nation sticks their face and hands into 
their first birthday cake 
the mailbags bringing up to 1800 tapes a day are americas 
funniest home videos lifeline 
this is a show that is truly hand to mouth said di bona 
if the country aint funny i aint funny 
di bona said his weekly show costs around 400000 his material 
is free but he claims his staff and equipment costs are 
considerably higher than other halfhour shows 
he estimates for example that the video machines purchased a 
few months ago are about to wear out and because the tapes are of 
private events clearances have to be obtained from featured 
characters before it can run 
but the cost still is about half the estimated 800000 a week 
needed to produce a top 10 series like the cosby show or 
cheers even with the 10000 awarded to the funniest home 
video each week 
abcs censors have so far squelched just two of the clips di 
bona submitted a youngster applying the nozzle of a running vacuum 
cleaner to his face was nixed as was one of a baby crawling with a 
clear plastic mixing bowl over his head too close to the eyes and 
nose censors said 
efforts to stage events are so poorly done that they have always 
been spotted staff members say 
a clip gets on the show after being viewed by a screener who 
grades it on a scale from one to 10 with those with a five or 
below eliminated the others are viewed by an assistant producer 
and move up the line before being selected most segments zoom 
along with pratfalls snaky garden hoses upchucking babies and 
brides tossing wedding bouquets into the twilight zone but the 
producers are trying to pace the show with some longer pieces 
a 90second clip for example showed a couple married for 43 
years arguing over singing a favorite song the wife comes from 
behind the camera and joins her husband to warble the tune as a 
duet 
di bona bought the rights to the format from a show in japan 
but said its appeal is a little bit of warner bros cartoons a 
lot of three stooges a little bit of keystone kops 
the low cost high ratings and easytocopy formula assure 
competition plans were announced last week for a syndicated show 
called the 1 million video challenge 
di bona a television veteran of 22 years whose previous credits 
include entertainment tonight is building his fortress now 
were at the vanguard he says we have really set the 
stage for all of this and we realize that there are people who are 
trying to copy and will copy us we are making very sure that they 
are going to have a tough time doing it 
he said that he has sown up deals for shows with americas 
funniest home videos format in england australia scandinavia 
and germany and smaller markets like thailand and saudi arabia 
negotiations are under way for a show in france 
the deals include exchanges of video clips with the foreign 
shows one method to keep the series fresh another suggested by 
abc entertainment chief robert iger is assignment america 
with saget asking the audience to send in such items as magic 
tricks and first haircuts

it was last june when she began work at the museum of 
africanamerican history in detroit that lenda jackson 
unconsciously began to change the way she defined herself instead 
of black she started saying africanamerican 
i consider myself a black woman but africanamerican just 
sounds better to me says ms jackson the museums public 
relations director africanamerican is just more descriptive of 
what we are no one is really black like the color black 
many black americans have come to that conclusion in recent 
years especially since the rev jesse jackson proposed a change in 
terms of reference africanamerican appears to be gaining currency 
as the term of choice for many blacks and shows signs of seeping 
into the culture at large 
in addition to jackson it is used by new york mayor david 
dinkins atlanta mayor maynard jackson rep william gray of 
pennsylvania tennis star and author arthur ashe and novelist 
ishmael reed oprah winfrey has referred to herself as a colored 
girl who became a negro then black then africanamerican 
president bush in mourning the death in december of black 
choreographer alvin ailey called him a man committed to weaving 
his africanamerican heritage into our nations cultural tapestry 
it has become the preferred term at some radio stations and 
black newspapers including the new york amsterdam news and the 
atlanta voice and on college campuses and in scholarly 
publications 
its fashionable now to be known as africanamerican ms 
jackson said just as in the 70s it was fashionable to be called 
afroamerican or black which was preferable to negro just as 
negro was preferable to colored 
in one sentence that more or less sums up a century of 
linguistic history one rife with politics bigotry and deep 
emotion just as one can date a tree from its rings one can 
roughly judge the age of a black organization from its title the 
national association for the advancement of colored people 1909 
the united negro college fund 1944 the congressional black 
caucus 1971 
now add to the list the african american summit 1989 it was 
at this conclave of black leaders in new orleans last april that 
jackson made a speech in which he called for a change from black to 
africanamerican 
the change was first proposed the previous december at a meeting 
in chicago to lay the groundwork for the summit ramona h edelin 
president of the national urban coalition suggested that blacks 
needed a greater sense of their history one way to start she 
said would be to call themselves africanamericans 
the term was already gaining use especially in academic 
circles ms edelins idea was enthusiastically adopted 
to be called africanamerican has cultural integrity 
jackson explained at the chicago meeting it puts us in our 
proper historical context every ethnic group in this country has a 
reference to some land base some historical culture base 
africanamericans have hit that level of cultural maturity 
surveys conducted since then have shown that the term has been 
accepted by at least a sizeable minority of blacks 
in polls last march and april by time magazine and the chicago 
tribune 26 percent of the black respondents said they preferred 
africanamerican sixtyone percent in the time poll said they 
preferred black in the tribune poll only 40 percent said they 
preferred black and 31 percent said either term was fine 
in may the san diego school district surveyed black pupils 
parents and civic leaders to determine which term they preferred 
fortyone percent of the students 49 percent of their parents and 
70 percent of local leaders said they preferred africanamerican 
as a result of the survey san diego schools now use 
africanamerican instead of black in their lessons and official 
paperwork 
i frankly am astonished at how quickly its been received 
ms edelin said some people never liked black because you may 
have noticed that africanamericans come in every shade in the 
universe black was always confusing for some children this 
obviates all that confusion and also hopefully will get us past 
some internecine wars over shades of color 
in contrast to the change from negro to black two decades ago 
little rancor surrounds the emergence of africanamerican it is 
not associated with a radical political movement as black was and 
has never been used as a putdown as black once was a variation 
afroamerican has a long history as a respectable term for blacks 
at naacp headquarters in baltimore spokesman james williams 
said many officials use the terms africanamerican and black 
interchangeably the organizations official position is that usage 
is up to the individual 
africanamerican said john baugh a professor of linguistics at 
the university of texas at austin is a term that will gain broad 
acceptance especially in literate circles and it will be a term 
that conveys respect but it will not become offensive to call an 
africanamerican black 
if africanamerican is to become the standard term nearly 
everyone agrees the next step must be for it to be accepted in 
mainstream culture that may be starting 
the merriamwebster co will consider placing the word in the 
next websters dictionary editorial director frederick mish said 
new words must be used frequently in different settings over a 
period of years before they make it into the dictionary 
its well on its way to meeting the kinds of tests we require 
for new entries mish said 
the us census bureau is using the terms black or negro on 
its 1990 census forms it used negro in 1960 negro or 
black in 1970 and black or negro in 1980 census spokesman 
miguel rivera said africanamerican would be used in the 2000 
census if there is sufficient demand 
most general interest newspapers have rules of style that 
require their writers to use black unless they are quoting someone 
that too could change 
at the los angeles times spokeswoman laura morgan said some 
black journalists have expressed a preference for africanamerican 
and the newspaper is considering changing its rules 
at the boston globe the term black is preferable but there 
is no proscription against the use of africanamerican spokesman 
richard gulla said 
the associated press stylebook used by many newspapers calls for 
the use of black however if usage dictates eventually well 
change stylebook editor norm goldstein said 
not everyone likes the new term some people have suggested that 
it doesnt apply to all americans of color blacks who came from 
the west indies for instance or those black americans whose 
ancestors did not come from africa darkskinned people from 
australia or asia for instance 
phillip t gay an associate professor of sociology at san diego 
state university wrote the los angeles times last april to make 
the case for black instead of africanamerican 
the culturally significant links to africa were broken during 
the years of slavery he wrote a name change might obscure 
that fact but it wont change it 
but ms edelin and other proponents of africanamerican say 
their whole point is to reclaim that lost heritage to revive the 
best that is in our ancient culture

americans who regularly attend their local church or synagogue 
are more productive in the workplace have a more stable family 
life and volunteer more time to charitable causes 
these are among survey findings compiled in a new report 
religion and the public interest by a national interfaith 
organization that encourages religious participation 
religion in american life rial issued the report shortly 
before the midapril launching of its annual advertising campaign 
to stimulate worship attendance with this slogan bring a 
friend 
the report incorporating recent findings of five research 
organizations says that a lot more americans are regular 
worshippers than is the common impression 
more than l00 million people attend church or synagogue 
regularly but a survey in the nations four largest cities found 
that a majority thinks the number is less than half that 
people simply have no idea about how many go to church each 
week said nicholas b van dyck president of of rial with 
headquarters in princeton nj the reality is double what people 
think it is 
while many worship frequently without making it every week the 
latest gallup poll finds that in an average week 43 percent of 
americans 107 million of them attended church or synagogue 
the report says 96 percent of the population or 242 million 
americans believe in god and 69 percent of them or 172 million 
claim affiliation with a religious denomination 
the findings were compiled from studies by the gallup 
organization the lilly endowment the independent sector giving 
usa of the american association of fund raising counsel and 
proprietary research 
other items cited in the report 
regular worshippers are 50 percent more likely to reject 
illicit drugs than nonworshippers 
churches and synagogues contribute more to americas social 
services and in improving the lot of the needy than any other 
nongovernmental institution including corporations 
beyond their own expenses religious organizations contribute 
19 billion annually to child and elder care education health 
food for the hungry housing for the homeless and other 
nonreligious work in the public interest 
the dollar value of volunteer time given by churchgoers to 
community services that are not churchrelated amounts to more than 
6 billion annually 
churches and synaoggues lead the list of the top 24 
organizations regarded as improving urban life and are found to be 
among the most costeffective charitable institutions in society 
church and synagogue members are more likely than 
nonworshippers to agree that duty comes before pleasure and 
that facing daily tasks is a source of pleasure and 
satisfaction 
people from congregations account for most of the volunteer 
hours for health care education and the arts in this country 
van dyck said 
he added that they also demonstrate betterthanaverage 
productivity in the work place and commitment to family life 
about 50 religious bodies protestant roman catholic mormon 
jewish and eastern orthodox are represented in rial which was 
founded in 1949 and has greatly increased in scope since 
its annual campaigns developed by the advertising council 
include billboards posters in public transportation broadcast 
spots and public service ads in magazines and newspapers 
a preparatory brochure get ready get set invite a friend 
has been distributed to congregations of participating 
denominations 
ads are to include a tollfree telephone number directing 
callers to evangelism departments of the church of their choice 
concerning the years slogan van dyck a presbyterian said 86 
percent of regular churchgoers initially were invited by a friend 
which makes application of the slogan promising for boosting church 
rolls still more

for most interest groups pushing their wares 
in washington certified us government numbers are among the 
roots of all influence they use the statistics as evidence of 
strength and of the magnitude of problems they insist should get 
federal attention 
that has made the numbers game an integral part of the process 
in which rival blocs lobby for influence and above all federal 
dollars 
but activists who claim to represent the interests of the 
homeless in america are not playing at numbers now some of them 
tried to sabotage the governments first attempt to count the 
homeless preferring to stick with old estimates on the theory that 
census takers couldnt come close to counting all the people 
involved 
they argue that any census count will be so low that it 
shouldnt be compiled at all its going to be used to try and 
drive down appropriations said mitch snyder the washington 
activist for the homeless who has made himself the most visible 
figure in the movement 
he has a vested interest in the current undocumented estimate 
that more than 3 million americans are homeless because he was 
involved in producing the number 
but others who work to help the homeless disagree with those who 
resist the census contending that an attempt at a real count will 
help dramatize the problem and could promote programs to deal with 
it 
thats the way government counts have worked in other campaigns 
lyndon b johnsons war on poverty gained impetus when the 
government which he was running at the time put numbers on the 
problem by setting a poverty income line and estimating how many 
americans lived on less money 
the census bureau never has claimed that it could produce an 
accurate count of all the homeless people in the country only that 
it would send its people out on march 20 to find as many as 
possible and would report those findings in 1991 as part of the 
overall census 
it wont describe the findings as a count of the homeless but 
rather as a report on how many people its enumerators found in 
shelters on the streets and in hotel rooms that cost 12 a night 
or less 
barbara bryant director of the census said that should cover 
the vast majority of homeless people there are no believable 
numbers of homeless in america she said this is going to get 
an order of the magnitude of the problem 
while there may not be any believable numbers there are 
estimates of the number of homeless that range from 250000 to more 
than 3 million the latter number is snyders it first appeared in 
a paper published by his community for creative nonviolence in 
1982 
in congressional testimony in 1984 snyder said the number was 
meaningless we have tried to satisfy your gnawing curiosity for 
a number because we are americans with western little minds that 
have to quantify everything in sight whether we can or not he 
said 
at about the same time the department of housing and urban 
development conducted its own survey and came up with an estimate 
of 250000 to 350000 homeless 
in 1988 the urban institute issued an estimate of about 600000 
snyder countered that just about everybody in america who is 
involved thinks the figure is 2 to 3 million 
carl f horowitz a washington urban planner recounted the 
story of the numbers in an analysis written for the conservative 
heritage foundation last year 
he said mary ellen hombs was the principal author of the report 
that came up with the 3 million figure she later became 
coordinator of the national coalition for the homeless horowitz 
quoted her as saying that numbers dont make any difference that 
the government should spend its money housing the homeless instead 
of trying to count them 
the count is done now at a cost estimated at more than 27 
million the result will be announced late in 1991 and the 
argument will start all over again

broke need a rich uncle when it comes to war 
reparations win or lose you cant beat uncle sam for generosity 
even though hes never been in the black since the day he was born 
and with one ironic exception that aint whistling dixie 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
president bush has asked congress for 500 million for aid to 
panama and 300 million for nicaragua which reminds us once again 
that in war or peace aggressor or aggressee uncle sam picks up 
most of the tab 
the money now sought is intended to help one country recover 
from an american invasion and the other from a war the united 
states supported for 10 years tiny granada was broke until uncle 
sam invaded in 1983 and sent 110 million in appreciation 
the whole business recalls an old israeli joke prime minister 
ben gurion was worried about keeping his new nation solvent a 
colleague playfully suggested israel go to war against the united 
states and after certain defeat could expect a flood of dollars 
from washington 
ben gurion thought that over carefully then with talmudic 
caution he asked but suppose we win 
after two of its three biggest wars the united states supplied 
its defeated enemy with billions in aid the exception and ultimate 
in ironies followed appomattox 
after world war ii we helped japan and west germany rebuild 
their economies and they rebuilt so well we are now begging for 
mercy but after our own civil war the government in washington 
sent no aid to the americans who lost nothing went south except 
the carpetbaggers and other vultures of reconstruction 
in this century uncle sam became the biggest giver and lender 
in history until the early 1950s he was supplying 90 percent of 
all foreign aid from all nations library of congress it was 
still 60 percent in 1965 25 percent in 1977 less than 15 percent 
since 
a mighty oak from one sickly acorn the united states began in 
1789 in debt 55 million borrowed at home and abroad to pay for 
the revolution it became the richest nation on earth but never got 
into the black the closest was 1834 when the national debt was 
only 38000 been up since there was always something 
we wanted to buy california and new mexico but mexico wasnt 
selling so we provoked a war and took them we called it 
manifest destiny and paid mexico 15 million in conscience 
money for the land that stretched to the sea and made us a 
continental nation 
wars grew bigger came the end of world war i the european 
allies owed uncle sam 92 billion and germany owed the allies 33 
billion in reparations there then occurred a wondrous sequence in 
which europe borrowed from sam to pay sam 
germany borrowed 25 billion from american investors paid the 
allies 45 billion in reparations the allies paid the us 26 
billion and then everything else was defaulted by the depression 
in world war ii we didnt call it debts we called it 
lendlease under that name we sent more than 52 billion worth of 
military and civilian supplies to great britain the soviet union 
and 38 other countries 
in theory the recipients were to return what usable equipment 
they had left after the war in theory they also were to supply 
the united states with reciprocal goods and services as best they 
could after the war never was theory more sorely tried lendlease 
turned out to be almost entirely gift 
since world war ii and largely for reasons of the cold war the 
united states has supplied more than 100 countries with 372 
billion worth of economic and military aid 
thousands of foreign military officers were brought here for 
special training at american expense abroad the united states 
maintained a network of bases around the world for which it paid 
handsome rent 
fairminded readers will want to remember that in the war of 
1812 the british charged us nothing for burning washington

a log cabin is the only place of 
jewish worship in this frozen region once called a promised land 
for soviet jews the makeshift rabbi boris kaufman conducts some 
services with the new testament 
he says he believes in jesus christ that makes kaufman a 
christian not a jew but few would notice in the jewish autonomous 
region of the soviet union 
little is jewish but the name in this remote corner of the 
soviet far east set aside in 1934 
kaufman a 40yearold preacher with a red beard who settled on 
judaism after trying the baptist and pentecostal faiths said he 
got his job by default after the regions only rabbi died a few 
years ago at age 86 
everything fell apart after the rabbis death kaufman 
recalled he acknowledged having little knowledge of hebrew the 
language of the old testament and said he interprets jewish 
religious doctrine loosely 
during hanukkah the feast of lights when jews around the world 
lit ceremonial candles and recited holiday prayers there were no 
candles in the jewish autonomous region and no worshipers in the 
cabin snowcovered street banners bore only secular greetings for 
the new year 
the region has no real rabbi or other jewish clergy no 
religious education or kosher food no one can remember the last 
true jewish wedding or bar mitzvah the ritual that marks a boys 
13th birthday 
as a western writer put it decadesold hopes for the jewish 
autonomous region were blown away by the cold siberian wind 
after the 1917 bolshevik revolution the new leaders broke with 
the czarist policy of confining jews to a section of the southern 
and southwestern russian empire known as the pale 
they gave jews their own territory a sparsely populated tract 
between the bira and bidzhan rivers a region the size of belgium 
rich in forests tin deposits and such wildlife as the siberian 
ussuri tiger and wild boar 
most of the jewish autononomous region is farmland wooden huts 
dot the landscape outside the regional capital birobidzhan a town 
of old brick apartment buildings and newer prefabricated concrete 
dwellings 
it was an artificial entity prompted by the new governments 
nationalities policy and by military strategy it forms a buffer on 
the border with manchuria 
creating the region also served to counter zionism the movement 
advocating jewish settlement in palestine 
the government hoped large numbers of jewish farmers and 
tradesmen would make the 5000mile trek from moscow and other 
russian cities in 1935 president mikhail kalinin boldly 
predicted in 10 years time birobidzhan will become the most 
important guardian of the jewish national culture 
kalinins hopes were not realized 
comparatively few jews made the trip and of those who did come 
to escape persecution and famine many soon left the climate was 
harsh temperatures reached 13 fahrenheit this winter the land 
was undeveloped and the nations jewish centers were a world away 
bolshevik leader leon trotsky a jew who was born lev bronstein 
eventually described the experiment as a bureaucratic farce 
the late soviet leader nikita s khrushchev declared it a failure 
jews never became more than a small minority in the region 
despite lenins stipulation of uniform nationality in such areas 
the jewish autonomous region has 8887 jews 4 percent of the 
regions population and fewer than onehalf percent of the soviet 
unions 14 million jews 
official propaganda still portrays the region almost as a jewish 
paradise a showplace of assimilation and a refutation of claims 
that soviet jews are persecuted 
in a dispatch in october 1988 about the russianborn jewish 
writer sholon aleichem the official news agency tass said 
birobidzhans example clearly shows that the writers dream of 
seeing his people free and happy has come true 
most jews in the region appear to have assimilated and to have 
succumbed to official atheism 
some did not survive josef stalins purge of 1937 and his 
campaign against jewish cosmopolitanism in 1948 exhibits in a 
section of the birobidzhan museum say many jews including 
americans who came to help work the land were killed or sent to 
labor camps 
yiddish schools a publishing house and a theater were closed 
birobidzhan has some appearance of jewish life along with 
factories that make combines shoes and electrical transformers 
signs on stores and public buildings are in yiddish as well as 
russian the main street is not named after lenin as in most 
soviet cities but for sholom aleichem 
in keeping with government policy of treating jews as a 
nationality not a religious group there are some signs of jewish 
culture a theater radio programs in yiddish a cultural club and 
schools where yiddish is taught after a 42year ban a hotel 
restaurant serves pseudojewish cuisine 
there is virtually nothing religious although president mikhail 
s gorbachev has proclaimed official tolerance of religion and 
permitted a revival of religious life nationwide 
kaufman said few young people are interested in the religion and 
he has difficulty assembling the required 10man quorum for 
services 
he would like to see a religious revival he said and hopes a 
young man studying in moscow will become the rabbi in birobidzhan 
the student has been offered the job but some jews in birobidzhan 
said he wasnt interested 
local officials many of them jews seem uninterested in 
improving religious life 
mayor mark kaufman no relation to boris acknowledged the 
logcabin synagogue was in bad shape and pledged to improve 
conditions for worship he also called the synagogue a part of 
jewish history and suggested converting it to a cultural center 
arkady kuperman religion correspondent of the 
yiddishlanguage newspaper birobidzhaner stern said he saw 
nothing wrong with the lack of interest in religion 
we are atheists he said we spent our whole lives without 
god and this doesnt bother me 
at birobidzhans teachertraining college opened in october as 
part of gorbachevs liberalization program there is a jewish 
language and literature department with classes in yiddish hebrew 
classes are planned but not religious instruction 
there are no real believers among us except for old people 
said larisa tsilman one of the institutes two young yiddish 
teachers 
officials see the region as an alternative destination for 
soviet jews considering emigration a few families have applied to 
move here because of what they consider an increase of 
antisemitism elsewhere in the soviet union 
most soviet jews wanting to leave however continue to choose 
israel or the united states 
talk of emigration also increases among jewish residents of 
birobidzhan 
four families went to live abroad last year vladimir okun 66 
who runs the birobidzhan chess club and keeps up with the gossip 
predicts all the jews in the jewish autonomous region will be gone 
in five years

sheriff bob braudis his star on the wall 
behind his desk and his skis in the corner admits to living a 
childhood dream as a marshal in the wild west 
but the former new york city business analyst like others who 
chased dreams to aspen in the 1960s and 1970s now sees the towns 
wild side being squeezed out 
aspens population is changing and its long struggle to figure 
out just how much growth it can handle is intensifying 
back then coming to aspen was analagous to dropping out 
says braudis i came to aspen to get away from traffic jams 
negative newspapers crowding pollution and all those things 
have caught up with me 
braudis doesnt get many calls to round up horse thieves or 
even as a sheriff here might have a decade ago drug dealers now 
hes asked if his deputies can provide security at fancy parties 
the core of aspen has become really manicured and buffed old 
victorian buildings have been torn down and rehabbed says the 
sheriff and former ski bum 
ski bums cant afford to live here anymore the death of the 
ski bum is somewhat symbolic of whats happened to aspen 
discussing whats happened to aspen has become something of an 
obsession here following backtoback elections 
on feb 13 voters rejected a proposed ban on fur sales and 
approved the building of a large hotel downtown the widening and 
straightening of overburdened highway 82 and measures aimed at 
creating affordable housing the ritzcarlton hotel vote was 
particularly divisive many residents say and reflected a new 
more welcoming attitude toward growth 
on march 13 voters recalled antigrowth city councilman steve 
crockett who was accused of being rude to constituents but kept 
in office mayor bill stirling who led the antifur campaign and 
two other targeted councilmen the recall movement began in 
response to their reluctance to approve the largescale hotel 
the transformation from funky rustic retreat to glitzy resort 
isnt unique to aspen its happened in other upscale tourist 
towns but few places have responded with as much acrimony 
handwringing and national attention 
this was after all one of the first communities in the nation 
to embrace daylightsavings time nuclearfree zones and 
publicsmoking bans and to close its doors to neon billboards and 
fastfood restaurants 
unlike its developmenthungry neighbors on colorados western 
slope aspens problem is how to work with the developers knocking 
at the door and still keep the qualities that attracted dreamers in 
the first place a clean environment a social conscience a sense 
of community 
aspens population estimated at about 5000 during the summer 
and four times that in the winter is one of the most educated per 
capita in the nation the town has attracted a variety of arts 
groups think tanks and environmental research institutes 
one local newspaper refers to the area outside the roaring fork 
valley as the real world 
but aspen is less and less of an escape for anybody but the 
ultrarich 
hemmed in by mountains it has limited building space in the 
late 1970s the pitkin county commissioners set an annual limit on 
infrastructure growth of 35 percent to control mushrooming 
subdivisions 
some say those limits only drove up the price of existing 
properties particularly in the late 1980s when the aspen skiing 
co began a marketing push following a minirecession early in the 
decade by 1989 the average price of an aspen home reached 1 
million 
michael kinsley a county commissioner from 1975 to 1985 and now 
an economicdevelopment expert for the rocky mountain institute 
says real estate prices would have risen without growth 
restrictions 
supply and demand doesnt explain circumstances here he 
says what it ignores is the nature of the demand people want 
milliondollar houses 
many locals have been pushed out of rental units or sold their 
properties for a fortune and moved down valley to towns like 
basalt carbondale and glenwood springs 
many who remain from doctors to dishwashers live in employee 
housing or pay rent kept artificially low by city mandate they 
often leave town to go shopping getting groceries in glenwood 
springs and clothes as far away as denver about 200 miles away 
now an estimated 20000 cars a day travel highway 82 nearly 
three times the traffic it was made for says braudis its 
estimated half aspens workers live down valley and commute 
that emigration leaves a disquieting feeling among those 
remaining that their community may be unraveling 
braudis predicts that within a year or two pitkin county will 
be forced to form a paid or partially paid fire department because 
aspen is losing the people who volunteered for yearround services 
like the fire department and the mountain rescue team 
walking to work sometimes its kind of like a movie set 
says steve wicks 36 who moved to aspen when he was 15 and now 
owns aspen drug everythings maintained but nobodys home 
theres nobody out washing the car or riding their bike 
all but one of his 15 employees lives down valley wicks says 
cliff camron manager of the aspen athletic club has the same 
problem 
this was our most difficult year to find staff because of the 
difficulty of finding housing says camron who lives in 
pricecontrolled housing paying 750 for a onebedroom apartment 
offsetting the migration down valley is an influx of the 
superwealthy who often live in aspen only part of the year and 
the poor mostly hispanics who take the service jobs ski bums used 
to hold says braudis 
aspen still has its resident stars from earlier more offbeat 
times like singer john denver and writer hunter s thompson but 
they are eclipsed during the resorts busiest weeks by a galaxy of 
glamorous parttime residents from don johnson to donald trump 
despite the recent antifur campaign fur coats are nearly as 
numerous as parkas on the downtown mall and in restaurants 
the newer immigrants have distinguished themselves in several 
areas with an elitist and socially stratified attitude braudis 
says 
in the old days the millionaire got off the plane and went to 
his home and changed into jeans and a turtleneck he emulated the 
ski bums and invited them to parties now theres a little berlin 
wall between them and the locals thats probably typical of most 
highdollar resorts but its never been true of aspen 
the newer residents and tourists have expectations of a much 
higher level of service than a rural colorado government can 
afford which is taxing his department braudis says 
calls to the sheriffs office have increased 56 percent in the 
last three years without a commensurate increase in the 
population he says 
people are asking government to intervene inappropriately i 
have to contrast that with the rugged individualism of the 60s and 
70s he says

plywood suggestion boxes collecting dust in 
the corners of workshops are history 
employers want to hear the ideas more than ever before but 
today those boxes are replaced with computerpunched applications 
workerinvolvement programs use surveys interviews and even health 
plans to cut costs and increase production 
suggestion systems pick the brain of the employee said jim 
canada president of the national association of suggestion 
systems the culture of today is that managers must realize their 
employees have excellent ideas and solutions and they must look at 
these ideas openly 
nass a chicagobased group represents 1200 of the worlds 
largest companies it tracks the successes and failures of 
suggestion programs and helps members forge their own plans 
the results are suggestive 
american airlines saved 407 million in 1989 by adopting 
workers ideas said canada who manages the carriers ideaas in 
action program in tulsa in 1988 nass member organizations saved 
225 billion in labor and material costs 
the idea is that workers know their jobs better than anyone and 
know how to streamline them worker incentives to make suggestions 
range from cash to merchandise to letters of recommendation 
at americans maintenance and engineering facility in tulsa 
employee carol hamer suggested using an adhesive rather than hot 
glue to assemble airline seats the change saves time and cut costs 
by nearly 230000 ms hamer was given 36000 for the idea 
these people are living and breathing their jobs eight hours a 
day canada said theyre going to know far more about a 
function than management 
the nass program covers more than soliciting ideas for 
improvement canada said teams interview employees about their 
positions and hand out surveys under a wellness program 
companies encourage employees to stay healthy 
you work to improve the health of the worker he said 
its my belief that employee will be more productive 
the first corporate suggestion program started at eastman kodak 
co in 1898 william m connor told his bosses in rochester ny 
the windows should be washed regularly in the blackpaper slitting 
room 
decades later prior to world war ii the programs grew 
dramatically the government asked companies providing war 
materials to cut costs and nass was formed in 1942 
about the same time corporate america was undergoing massive 
changes fewer executives climbed the ladder to their postings and 
lateral career moves were status quo 
the old style of workers moving up the ladder after theyve 
been machinists would be one where they retain some of the insights 
of the work situation said kenneth benson a nationally 
recognized industrial sociologist at the university of missouri 
the problem even with that is that technology changes pretty 
rapidly ones direct knowledge of the work situation may be pretty 
quickly outdated 
so turn to the line worker 
benson said suggestion programs are vital to overcome resentment 
some workers feel toward employers they become involved in the 
companys decisions by sharing their ideas and common ground is 
struck 
there is a fundamental conflict of interest between workers 
and managers that centers around the struggle over wages and 
profits benson said its a structural problem 
once managers enter into managerial positions theyre 
structurally removed from workers theyre in different worlds 
they have different goals workers very quickly begin to distrust 
them and see them as representatives of the other side 
canada said the nass programs will become vital as competition 
increases among companies and employers discover a neglected 
resource 
in the 90s companies will be forced to become more 
competitive canada said their greatest resources will be 
their employees theyll be seen less for their physical stature 
and more for their minds and creativity 
its extremely important to involve the employees

eastern airlines says difficulties in rebuilding 
its strikebattered business are causing it to lose much more money 
than expected and will delay its emergence from bankruptcy 
reorganization 
the beleagured carrier also said tuesday that its dampened 
business prospects have left it unable to pay unsecured creditors 
50 cents on the dollar as it had tentatively agreed to do 
the airline which has been trying to reorganize under federal 
bankruptcy court supervision said it now expects to lose 330 
million this year or 185 million more than it estimated in 
january 
eastern also said it no longer projects a profit for next year 
because restoring its revenue structure battered by a strike by 
its machinists flight attendants and pilots unions has taken 
longer than anticipated 
the gloomier outlook means the carrier will not emerge from 
bankrupcty court proceedings early this summer as it had hoped 
phil bakes president and chief executive of the miamibased 
carrier presented the revised business plan to the creditors group 
meeting in new york 
in an interview after the meeting bakes expressed 
disappointment about having to revise the projections but he said 
we have no reason to believe eastern will not emerge successfully 
from chapter 11 
the delay will probably last for 30 to 60 days beyond the 
previous goal of late june or by july 1 he said 
a spokesman for the machinists union charles bryan reacted 
bitterly to easterns announcements 
they never produce what they say theyre going to produce 
weve known for many years from doing business with these people 
everything they do is so elusive its like trying to take hold of 
smoke bryan said 
calls to some of the unsecured creditors largely equipment 
supplies such as aircraft and engine makers werent returned 
the creditors are owed 980 million by eastern they stood to 
receive about 490 million in cash and notes from eastern and 
sister carrier continental airlines under a tentative agreement 
announced in late february 
but bakes said the airline has had trouble generating increased 
revenue from business travelers he blamed the negative and 
disruptive public perception surrounding easterns reorganization 
process 
bakes estimated that eastern lost two to three business 
passengers per flight in january and february which would amount 
to more than 100 million in lost revenue over a fully year 
the carriers results during the first two months of the year 
also suffered from high fuel prices and the lack of costsaving 
agreements with its pilots and flight attendants he said 
he said the carriers flight activity as of july 1 will be 12 
percent less than estimated in january and eastern will cut its 
fleet to 148 from 160 by selling aircraft 
eastern also plans to seek annual savings of 33 million by 
cutting the cost of health benefits to early retirees and those 
under age 65 the bankruptcy court must approve the move 
the carrier also may try to save 80 million in annual labor 
costs by seeking a bankruptcy courtsupervised resolution of its 
longrunning contract dispute with the air line pilots association 
and transport workers union 
eastern and the union have tentatively agreed to an interim 
contract that includes a 25 percent wage cut for pilots still being 
paid at prestrike wage rates but that would expire july 1 
eastern said it will file for the resolution this week unless 
the national mediation board succeeds or appears likely to succeed 
in reaching a resolution in contract negotiations under section 
1113 of the bankruptcy code eastern could obtain a contract 
resolution within 52 days 
eastern a division of houstonbased texas air corp began 
operating under chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection from its 
creditors on march 9 1989 five days after three unions struck the 
carrier since that time the pilots and flight attendants unions 
have withdrawn from the strike 
bakes told the committee that eastern will boost its marketing 
effort including a substantial expansion in advertising and 
promotional spending on its business flyer program to counter 
negative accounts of easterns situation 
bakes also said eastern and texas air plan to continue to move 
ahead on an agreement with courtappointed bankruptcy examiner 
david shapiro under which texas air and its continental airlines 
subsidiary would assist eastern in completing its reorganization

shearson lehman hutton inc will charge a record 
700 million against quarterly earnings to pay for layoffs office 
closings and reserves against bad real estate loans according to a 
top credit rating agency 
the pretax charge estimated by standard amp poors corp would be 
the largest in securities industry history exceeding a 470 
million charge by merrill lynch amp co in the 1989 fourth quarter 
meanwhile tuesday shearson parent american express co 
sweetened its buyout of all publicly held shares of shearson it 
doesnt already own in response attorneys agreed to drop about 20 
classaction lawsuits filed by shareholders challenging the merger 
american express also said a previously announced 750 million 
capital infusion had been made available to shearson american 
express will have pumped about 135 billion into shearson in 
recent months once the recapitalization plan is completed 
detailing the charge sampp said shearson will need up to 300 
million to cover potential losses from its balcor co real estate 
subsidiary up to 100 million for severance payments to 2000 
employees laid off this month and up to 100 million to pull back 
from certain business lines 
but if march performance is awful then all bets are off and 
conceivably the number could be higher sampp vice president 
jeffrey bowman said 
shearson has said it expects a significant firstquarter 
charge a shearson spokesman declined further comment on the 
charge which wall street analysts had estimated at as much as 500 
million 
separately the new york times reported in wednesdays editions 
that prudentialbache securities inc was planning to dismiss 300 
to 500 employees as part of a reorganization 
we are engaged in the process of shrinking certain businesses 
while expanding in others a spokesman for the securities firm 
told the newspaper 
under the stock buyback american express will exchange about 
134 million shares of its common stock for the 28 million 
remaining publicly held shearson shares 
the shearson stock would be converted into 048 of a share of 
american express stock that would be a 127 percent increase from 
the 0426 a share announced march 4 
based on tuesdays closing price of 2562 a share for american 
express and 1250 for shearson the deal values the minority stake 
at about 343 million 
the deal marks a reversal for american express which had 
intended to reduce its majority stake in the wall street firm that 
has been strained by overexpansion in the 1980s and a recession in 
the securities industry 
if completed american express would own about 92 percent of 
shearson with the rest held by nippon life insurance co of japan 
bowman said that while the recapitalization is positive for 
shearson american express credit rating could come under pressure 
if it is forced to continue injecting large amounts of capital into 
the brokerage 
after an initial recapitalization plan to breathe life into 
shearson fell through early this year american express decided to 
take control of its securities unit in an attempt to avoid a credit 
rating reduction 
the big credit card and financial services firm installed one of 
its executives to run shearson and announced a major costcutting 
that included the layoffs and 50 branch office closings shearson 
hopes the moves will save 400 million a year 
shearson with about 33500 employees is the second largest 
wall street firm behind merrill lynch 
shearson is hampered by overcapacity from its 1988 acquisition 
of ef hutton amp co diminished stock trading business since the 
1987 market crash and problems with its 11 billion real estate 
loan portfolio 
the revised stock purchase by american express was approved late 
monday by shearsons board following the recommendation of a 
special committee of three outside shearson directors and the 
american express board 
shearson and american express also said shareholders had agreed 
to drop classaction lawsuits challenging the merger pending court 
approval 
the lawsuits claimed american express was offering too little 
for the shearson stock which it had sold at 34 a share in an 
initial public offering in 1987 
spokesmen for shearson and american express declined to comment 
on whether the buyback was sweetened to resolve the litigation but 
shareholder attorneys said the price was raised in response 
i dont think theres any question that the litigation was a 
factor in the increased price said r bruce mcnew an attorney 
with the philadelphia law firm of greenfield amp chimicles which 
filed a classaction lawsuit

no matter how his proxy battle to unseat 
lockheed corps board turns out texas billionaire harold simmons 
can brag he forced the aerospace companys management to pay more 
attention to shareholders 
simmons got a boost tuesday from californias 56 billion 
public employees retirement system calpers the nations largest 
private pension fund which owns 500000 lockheed shares or less 
than 1 percent said it would vote for simmons slate of directors 
at lockheeds annual meeting thursday 
the chief reason was simmons support for a shareholders 
committee to advise lockheed management said calpers assistant 
general counsel kayla gillan calpers advocates such panels as a 
way institutional investors can influence companies 
ms gillan said other big institutional shareholders share 
calpers concerns good news for simmons and his chief lieutenant 
j landis martin 
were feeling very good about our position martin said 
lockheed chairman daniel tellep quickly responded by promising 
institutional shareholders a seat on the board after the annual 
meeting it was an attempt to woo the big institutions who own 60 
percent of lockheeds stock we will work with our institutional 
shareholders to develop a list of potential directors from within 
or outside their ranks who could provide additional perspective to 
our directors tellep said in a statement 
we believe that selection of at least one director from that 
list could provide important input to the future of the company 
simmons so far shows a paper loss of about 100 million on his 
530 million investment in lockheed 
in waging his proxy battle he has said that if he gets control 
he will refocus lockheed on profits rather than sales he claims 
that will increase the price of lockheeds stock which has plunged 
nearly 20 in recent months 
lockheed closed 112 higher at 37 a share tuesday on the new 
york stock exchange 
tellep acknowledged the company had concentrated on growth in 
new areas but said it already has refocused toward profits under a 
restructuring announced last year 
he said that after a decision to take nearly 500 million in 
writeoffs last year sending profits tumbling to 2 million from 
624 million in 1988 lockheed is now ready for a big turnaround 
the fact of the matter is that ive been stressing improved 
profits and return on assets and our fiveyear forecast reflects 
that tellep said in an interview this week its incorrect to 
say that were more interested in sales 
simmons controls about 19 percent of lockheeds stock and can 
acquire no more than 20 percent before lockheeds antitakeover 
provisions kick in making further stock purchases prohibitively 
expensive 
he has indicated he is likely to sell big chunks of lockheeds 
operations outside of its space missiles and aeronautics divisions 
but tellep said such a divestment program is already underway 
beginning in 1989 lockheed began selling off seven units with 
combined sales of 200 million he said 
he also attacked simmons claim that companies purchased by 
simmons have shown a consistent pattern of improved earnings and 
share values 
our share price decline is exactly within the pattern of the 
whole defense industry tellep said simmons nl industries 
stock declined 34 percent in the last six months so hes not 
exactly perfect 
he reiterated his contention that simmons knows nothing about 
running a defense contractor the size and complexity of lockheed 
which had revenues of 99 billion last year 
he says a lot of things but the question is what is his 
plan tellep said his fundamental problem is a lack of 
understanding of our basic business makeup 
he said he intended to meet with simmons after the shareholders 
meeting thursday to give him more insight into the company and in 
a video prepared for lockheed workers who also own about 19 
percent of the company through an employee stock ownership plan 
tellep promised better communication with them 
tellep also told calpers that after talking to shareholders 
around the country he realized he should support confidential 
voting ms gillan said 
that is one of several proposals advocated by simmons and 
calpers along with dropping the companys tough antitakeover 
provisions 
simmons promises are widerranging than lockheeds and he 
signed his ms gillan said explaining the funds decision to back 
simmons 
we havent seen anything in writing from mr tellep she 
said

the extended warranties and lossprotection 
now provided by many credit cards may soon be available for goods 
bought with checks issued by many banks 
bank of america said tuesday almost any purchase made by its 
customers using a personal check will be protected for free against 
loss theft damage or fire for 90 days after purchase 
the protection also automatically doubles the manufacturers 
us warranty up to one additional year on items such as home 
appliances video equipment computers toys and sports equipment 
the coverage will be effective almost immediately for the banks 
more than 3 million checking customers 
the move is part of a budding trend by banks to woo depositors 
by offering the added services on checking accounts 
citibank and chase manhattan bank in new york plan to start 
similar programs next week following the lead of first chicago 
last week and several smaller banks valley national bank in 
phoenix ariz napa valley bank in california and crossland 
savings bank in new york 
i think as time goes by more and more banks will offer this 
protection to their checking customers to remain competitive 
said chases marketing vice president chester myszkowski 
banks arent the only ones providing this new service coast 
savings a california thrift last week announced a similar plan 
american express co and many bank card companies have been 
offering purchase insurance to premium card holders for more than 
two years 
in addition to providing the protection for check users bank of 
america also will extend coverage as of april 1 to purchasers using 
its regular credit cards the bank has been offering the service to 
its premium card holders for 2 years bank of america has 5 
million credit card customers 
with this service our customers can save hundreds of dollars 
in costly repair or replacement bills said thomas e peterson 
vice chairman 
the coverage is being underwritten by national union fire 
insurance co of pittsburgh and bank of america has no liabilities 
for losses said bank spokeswoman shirley rigby norton 
she declined to disclose the cost of the insurance to the bank 
citing proprietary reasons but said it would not have a 
significant impact on the banks expenses 
its not expensive in what it costs the banks per account 
probably less than 1 a year said robert v conte a broker with 
cbsi an insurance marketing company in harrison ny that set up 
the chase and first chicago plans the underwriter for those plans 
also is national union fire insurance co 
theres no comparable policy that consumers can buy 
individually he said the extended warranties offered by 
dealers on things like stereos are expensive and have huge profit 
margins built in adding it to checking accounts is all the rage 
all of a sudden 
the banks extended warranties may cut into the profits of 
retailers who offer their own extended warranties 
but a spokesman for chicagobased sears roebuck amp co which 
offers a variety of maintenance agreements said he would not 
anticipate that the bank programs will affect sales of sears 
product coverage 
our coverage does more than extend the manufacturers 
warranties and it can last up to 10 years said sears spokesman 
gordon jones 
as of april 2 citibank a unit of citicorp will expand its 
purchase protection service now offered only to credit card 
customers to the banks 1 million customers who have a combined 
checking and savings account known as citione 
chase customers with similar better banking accounts will 
get the coverage as of april 1 the chase manhattan corp unit has 
been offering the coverage only to customers using unsecured credit 
lines and credit cards 
the loss protection plan for all the major banks gives buyers as 
much as 50000 coverage limited to the amount of the purchase 
paid by check or credit card the plans have a 2500 limit for 
claims involving jewelry watches furs and fine art 
customers do not have to register to join the programs or 
register their purchses eligible purchases will be covered only in 
excess of other collectible insurance such as homeowners or 
tenants insurance and can pick up the deductible from the 
customers other insurance 
customers must provide a sales receipt a copy of their canceled 
check or charge card slip and damaged merchandise as proof of 
purchase

the bush administration is counting on its 
proposed family savings plan to generate more revenue than it would 
cost but the senates chief taxwriter is skeptical 
that carries me back to 1981 when the reagan administration 
predicted that huge tax cuts would pay for themselves sen lloyd 
bentsen dtexas chairman of the senate finance committee said 
tuesday now we have these enormous deficits that in part were 
brought about by that magic 
the family savings plan is part of a package proposed by 
president bush as incentives to increased saving and investment 
under the plan a person with income under 60000 or a couple 
earning less than 120000 could annually deposit up to 2500 and 
5000 respectively and pay no tax on the interest if the account 
was maintained for at least seven years 
sidney l jones assistant secretary of the treasury for 
economic policy told the finance committee that the proposal would 
generate 40 billion in new individual savings over the next five 
years 
he said the white house council of economic advisers estimates 
that the plan would so boost saving and economic growth that it 
would lead to an increase in government revenues as well as 
personal saving in the longer run 
the administration makes the same argument on behalf of the 
biggest part of the presidents savings and investment package a 
proposal to cut the tax on capital gains the profits from sales of 
investments 
some economists quarrel with the administrations basic argument 
that a tax incentive will increase savings they cite individual 
retirement accounts as an example saying that most of the money 
going into iras is simply a transfer from taxable savings accounts 
the finance committee received conflicting advice on that point 
from two analysts associated with the private national bureau of 
economic research 
jonathan skinner of the university of virginia said an ira 
which provides a tax incentive at the time a deposit is made can 
boost savings by locking up an account until retirement he 
predicted that bushs plan which could be cashed in after seven 
years would lead to shuffling money from taxable to nontaxable 
accounts 
lawrence j kotlikoff of boston university said it is clear 
that saving policies of the last decade such as expansion of iras 
failed to promote national saving he suggested taxing 
consumption such as with a national sales tax to encourage 
saving 
the one point on which the economists administration witnesses 
and committee members agreed is that americans save too little of 
their income far less than japanese and west germans the us 
saving rate last year was 36 percent of net national income 
compared with an average of 89 percent during the 1950s 1960s and 
1970s 
increased savings would lower the cost of capital for our 
nations business enhance the ability of american companies to 
compete in a global market and lower the cost of most goods and 
services we consume said kenneth w gideon assistant secretary 
of the treasury for tax policy 
the national association of counties complained that the savings 
plan would force up the cost of borrowing for highways schools and 
other state and local building projects mary o boyle a cuyahoga 
county ohio commissioner speaking for the association said the 
accounts would compete for the same savings dollars as the 
taxexempt bonds on which states cities and counties rely 
local governments would be forced to pay higher borrowing 
costs just to compete an ultimate cost shift to all taxpayers 
ms boyle said that would endanger the nations system of 
highways bridges and sewers she said 
but gideon said the new accounts will have at most a small 
impact on the taxexempt bond market

federal aviation authorities will no longer 
fine airlines for safety violations if the carriers find the 
problem themselves quickly correct it and report it to the 
government 
federal aviation administration chief james b busey announced 
the new policy tuesday at a luncheon with airline officials an 
industry spokesman applauded the policy change but a pilots group 
cautioned against a falldown in faa enforcement 
busey acknowledged that his agency which monitors safety at 
airports used by us carriers throughout the world doesnt have 
enough manpower to catch every violation he said airlines have the 
responsibility to audit their own safety 
we cannot police every aspect of the industry cannot crawl 
through the belly of every aircraft look over the shoulder of 
every pilot or personally screen every passenger and every piece 
of luggage that flies in the system the faa administrator said 
the program could require airlines to designate safety auditors 
or set up separate safety departments busey said 
im offering an incentive to encourage executives of airline 
companies to monitor personally the safety of their operations as 
closely as they monitor the bottom line he said 
a backlog of several thousand fine cases has plagued the faa for 
several years most are for security screening violations at 
airports and busey said he has not yet decided how to handle them 
in the past the faa has assessed fines of up to 10000 per 
incident for security and maintenance violations even when an 
airline reports that it has found the problem itself 
busey said the new plan would cover large and small airlines and 
apply to any kind of violation 
make no mistake he warned our inspectors will continue 
to conduct regular inspections and surveillance and they will 
expect and demand 100 percent compliance with rules and 
regulations 
robert aaronson president of the air transport association 
which represents major carriers said safety often depends on the 
prompt sharing of information about problems among airlines he 
said the new program will encourage that 
aaronson said the policy would help ease a longstanding 
adversarial relationship in which the faa acts as accuser jury 
judge and hangman in safety violation cases the agency continues 
to have that power he said but buseys approach is an improvement 
aaronson said some airlines have been fined after discovering 
that an airport screening device was inoperative for an hour 
correcting the problem and then reporting it to the faa 
henry a duffy president of the air line pilots association 
said penalties should be increased with the voluntary approach 
the voluntary aspect of it is fine he said but there are 
always some airlines that require tough enforcement youve always 
got to have that guy with the club

the union representing striking greyhound bus 
drivers is urging the company to couple its offer of rewards for 
information about strikerelated violence with a return to 
negotiations 
anything that brings criminals to justice is great but its 
no excuse to stay away from the bargaining table union spokesman 
jeffrey nelson said tuesday after greyhound lines inc said it 
would pay 100000 for information leading to convictions for 
shootings at buses or terminals 
since the strike started march 2 there have been shooting 
attacks on 21 greyhound buses and two attacks on terminals 
greyhound vice president p anthony lannie said in announcing the 
rewards 
the terrorism must stop lannie said its inevitable that 
somebody is going to get hurt 
no one has been seriously injured in any of the shootings on 
the second day of the walkout a striking driver in redding 
calif was crushed to death by a bus driven by a replacement 
driver no one was charged 
certainly we condemn the violence but we dont have a hand 
in it nelson said 
meanwhile tuesday in west hartford conn the case against a 
striking driver accused of shooting at a bus two weeks ago was 
moved to hartford superior court so officials there can determine 
whether more serious charges are warranted 
roger cawthra 44 is accused of firing the shot that hit the 
luggage compartment of a greyhound bus carrying 19 passengers no 
one was injured 
cawthra the only person who has been arrested in any of the 
shootings was charged with firstdegree criminal mischief a 
felony and three misdemeanors firstdegree reckless 
endangerment unlawful discharge of a firearm and unlawful 
discharge of a firearm on a public highway 
the union said it is willing to resume negotiations at any time 
lannie said the company would not resume talks which broke down 10 
days ago in tucson ariz until management had hard assurances 
from the union that the violence would stop 
federal mediators are trying to meet separately with both sides 
but no immediate sessions were scheduled officials said we have 
no reason for optimism greyhounds lannie said adding that the 
union also would have to soften its wage demands before 
negotiations could resume 
wages work rules and job security are the key issues in the 
strike which involves 6300 drivers and 3000 other greyhound 
workers

the dollar strengthened in calm early european 
trading today fueled by weakness in the west german mark and 
japanese yen currency dealers said gold prices rebounded 
traders said investors were changing their minds about the 
dollar as initial euphoria over german unification fades and 
uncertainty about the economic costs for the mark emerge 
tensions in lithuania and concern over how soviet leader mikhail 
s gorbachev will handle them were also driving investors away from 
the west german currency 
its more emotional than technical but people are getting 
used to the notion of a stronger dollar again said an analyst in 
milan italy 
another said people are turning to the dollar from a lack of 
choice 
in tokyo where trading ends as europes business day begins 
the dollar rose for the ninth straight day closing 167 yen higher

the dollar climbed today against the yen for a 
ninth straight day despite the reported selling of 1 billion by 
japans central bank and closed at its highest level in more than 
three years 
the rise sent prices plunging on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 15863 yen in active trading up 167 yen 
from tuesdays close of 15696 yen it opened at 15830 yen and 
ranged between 15815 yen and 15885 yen 
the currency now has gained 643 yen in tokyo in nine trading 
days 
the dollars close was its highest since it finished the day at 
15805 yen on jan 12 1987 
the 225issue nikkei stock average lost 56239 points or 177 
percent closing at 3126357 the index fell 1453 points tuesday 
following a 146833point surge on monday 
an analyst with nomura securities co who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said stock investors were reluctant to make purchases 
because of uncertainies in the market caused by the yens rapid 
decline against the dollar 
volume on the first section of the exchange was estimated at 600 
million shares down from 700 million shares on tuesday 
a bank of tokyo official said the central bank intervened in the 
market by selling about 1 billion to prop up the yen the bank of 
japan usually does not comment on its market interventions 
unless the political or economic situation changes we can 
expect this thing to continue chemical bank dealer richard 
cameron said of the dollars rise 
the dollar has been so strong and its rising pace is very 
fast said shinichi kato of mitsui bank 
kato said large demand for the dollar was pushing the us 
currency higher importers many of whom are afraid that the dollar 
will rise further are jumping at the dollar whenever it moves 
downward he said 
kato also blamed the lack of coordinated market intervention 
among central banks for the dollars swift ascent 
the bank of japan alone can no longer control the situation 
he said the dollars upward momentum has become too strong now 
at a regular news conference wednesday bank of japan governor 
yasushi mieno said it is hard to understand why the yen continues 
to fall when japan continues to run large trade surpluses 
high exports would be expected to boost demand for the yen 
but mieno suggested that tensions in the soviet union and 
developments in europe together with factors connected with the 
end of japans fiscal year were boosting the dollar in foreign 
exchange markets 
the major monetary nations will continue cooperative 
intervention aimed at strengthening the yen and chances were good 
for stability returning to the market he said 
overall mieno said he sees no immediate threats to japans 
current economic expansion which has continued for 40 consecutive 
months 
because the us federal reserve board took no measures in the 
market on tuesday japanese market players began to speculate that 
the united states approves of the current dollaryen rate said 
kato 
the dollar will soon hit the 160yen level its just a matter 
of time he added 
the price of benchmark no 119 japanese government bonds closed 
at 8614 points up from tuesdays close of 8603 their yield 
declined to 7320 percent from 7345 percent

the us economy posted a 11 percent gain 
from october through december the slimmest quarterly advance in 
three years helping slow the increase of goods and services to 
just 3 percent in 1989 the government said today 
the commerce departments final revision of its fourthquarter 
gross national product was up slightly from the 09 percent gain in 
its estimate last month the departments initial estimate in 
january was 05 percent 
while the improvement was modest it was further evidence the 
economy can avoid an immediate recession and continue the longest 
peacetime expansion in us history 
the growth in the final three months of 1989 followed increases 
of 37 percent in the first quarter 25 percent in the second and 
3 percent in the third 
the 3 percent gain for all of 1989 was the smallest since a 27 
percent advance in 1986 and followed increases of 44 percent in 
1988 and 37 percent in 1987 
a consensus of economists had indicated in advance of the latest 
report that fourthquarter growth would remain at 09 percent 
many analysts however believe that while the pace of economic 
growth rose further during the current quarter partly because of 
weatherrelated factors it will not bounce back in 1990 to the 
levels experienced during much of the 1980s 
in fact the latest consensus of top economists projects a 17 
percent growth forecast for this year that would be the poorest 
performance since economic activity declined 25 percent in 1982 
during the last recession 
the fourth quarters 11 percent gain was the lowest since a 08 
percent advance in the third quarter of 1986 
an inflation index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 45 
percent last year the commerce department said the same as its 
estimate last month 
the various changes left the gnp expanding in the fourth quarter 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 417 trillion 
the department attributed the final revision to an increase in 
final sales which offset a decrease in the amount of inventories 
the biggest drag on the economy in the fourth quarter was 
durable goods which declined 14 percent 
other areas of weakness included capital spending and housing 
construction 
exports on the other hand jumped 94 percent in the fourth 
quarter while imports rose just 22 percent 
in a companion report the department said aftertax profits of 
us corporations rose 28 percent in the fourth quarter 
corporate profits fell during each of the other quarters of 1989 
11 percent in the first 72 percent in the second and 54 
percent in the third 
profits rose 14 percent in the final quarter of 1988 
the economy grew more than 3 percent during each of the years 
since the 19811982 recession except when it slowed to a 27 
percent gain in 1986 
but even moderate growth relieves recessionary fears that some 
felt late in 1989 as the economy slowed as a result of high 
interestrate policies of the federal reserve as it sought to stem 
inflation 
david wyss chief financial economist for drimcgrawhill a 
lexington mass forecasting organization said he is looking for 
15 percent growth during the current januarymarch period which 
still is pretty weak by normal standards but it doesnt look like 
were headed for a recession 
a recession usually is defined as two consecutive quarterly 
declines in the gnp the last decline was a onequarter 18 
percent drop in the second quarter of 1986 after which the economy 
resumed growth 
kathleen cooper senior financial economist for security pacific 
national bank in los angeles said she expects firstquarter growth 
of about 2 percent 
this quarter turned out to be a good deal stronger than we 
anticipated she said 
but it may well be that the first quarter will be the 
strongest of the year she added saying 1990 growth would 
register between 15 percent and 2 percent 
on the other hand michael k evans head of evans economics 
inc here is forecasting a surprisingly robust secondquarter 
growth of between 3 percent and 4 percent 
both ms cooper and evans said the relatively stronger numbers 
means it is unlikely the federal reserve will ease its tightcredit 
policies the bush administration and many economists have urged 
the fed to permit interest rates to fall to stimulate the economy 
the federal open market committee the central banks 
monetarypolicy setting arm met behind closed doors on tuesday to 
decide on its policies for the next six weeks as usual it will 
not announce its decision until next month

the figure was revised upward from a previous estimate of 09

union workers triumphantly marched into a 
colt manufacturing co plant today ending a strike that lasted 
more than four years and that resulted in employees becoming part 
owners of the firm 
about 80 members of united auto workers local 376 carrying 
banners proclaiming we beat em and we bought em proudly 
walked into colts gritty brick factory building for the start of 
the 7 am shift 
more than 300 coworkers who will return to work over the next 
two months lined the streets outside cheering as the workers took 
their first step inside since walking off the job on jan 24 1986 
its really kinda spooky said raynold guerrett 47 as he 
listened to instructions on how to operate some of the new 
computerized machinery that has since been installed at the 
nations oldest handgun manufacturer 
the strike officially ended last thursday when a buyout 
agreement was announced which makes the striking workers coowners 
of the plant along with colt managers the state of connecticut and 
private investors 
about 60 have retired nearly 40 have died and a few have chosen 
to remain at other jobs they found during the strike but company 
officials said 90 percent of the strikers contacted so far said 
they planned to return some 1050 uaw local 376 members walked off 
the job after working 10 months without a contract 
its amazing that so many of them are coming back and left 
whatever job they were working at to come back said ronald e 
stilwell executive vice president and chief operating officer of 
the new colt company the enthusiasm is incredible 
thursdays buyout agreement with new yorkbased colt industries 
parent of the gun maker meant all 600 replacement workers hired to 
keep colt plants in hartford and west hartford running during the 
strike lost their jobs 
however a handful of the replacement workers can expect to be 
offered jobs stilwell said 
the new company formerly known as colt industries firearms 
division is treating the returning veteran workers as if they were 
just hired each employee will fill out an application undergo a 
physical attend an orientation and go through training 
the new buyout agreement gives the workers a total of 13 
million in back pay settling an unfair labor practices suit 
against the company workers also got a 13 percent wage increase 
and a stock ownership plan which will allow the uaw members to own 
115 percent of the company

sales of new homes last month rebounded 31 
percent from steep declines in december and january the government 
reported today but analysts said sales remained depressed because 
of high mortgage interest rates 
its not a terribly optimistic outlook for the housing 
industry said economist richard peach of the mortgage bankers 
association i dont see much of a decline in rates in the months 
ahead and theres substantial risk that they will go higher in the 
second half of the year 
the commerce department said new singlefamily homes were sold 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 607000 units in february 
after plummeting a 68 percent in january and a revised 80 percent 
in december 
sales in both january and february were the lowest since 556000 
homes were sold on an annual basis last march sales totaled 
589000 in january 
sales in december the fourth coldest on record had dropped 
to 632000 which was revised down from the 634000 units 
originally reported but january was the warmest on record and 
analysts were surprised at its failure to lure buyers 
february also was unusually warm but failed to bring sales back 
to the level of 649000 units sold in 1989 
the national association of realtors reported on monday that 
sales of existing homes fell 23 percent in february to their 
slowest pace in seven months it blamed the decline on rising 
mortgage interest rates 
interest on fixedrate mortgages rose from 1017 percent at the 
beginning of february to 1031 percent before falling to 1023 
percent at months end according to the federal home loan mortgage 
corp 
realtors chief economist john a tuccillo said monday that rates 
should begin to drop in the months ahead and renew buyer interest 
the commerce department said the median price of a new home 
continued to climb in february rising 40 percent to 130000 
that compared with the realtors median price of 95400 for an 
existing home the median means half of the homes cost more and 
half less 
sales jumped 213 percent to 256000 units at an annual rate in 
the south but fell elsewhere in the nation 
they were down 18 percent to 82000 units in the northeast 64 
percent to 88000 units in the midwest and 16 percent to 181000 
units in the west

house democratic leaders today predicted early 
passage of their version of a major childcare bill saying a 
competing version backed by the white house lacks an important 
feature for middleclass familes 
everybody likes it house majority leader richard gephardt 
said after a closeddoor caucus with house democrats to explain the 
leaderships package the democratic bill is going to win 
the democratic bill is aimed at providing tax credits and other 
federal subsidies to help working families find and afford child 
care also to be voted on is a competing alternative backed by some 
conservative democrats republicans and the white house 
democrats made their package public tuesday evening before the 
rules committee which sets procedures for handling legislation 
the leaders planned to send it to the floor thursday despite 
protests by the republican minority that it was moving too fast and 
they had not been given an advance look at the bill 
were not trying to redesign at the federal level the 
childcare system thats out there said rep george miller 
dcalif a sponsor of the leaderships bill were trying to 
modestly upgrade it 
a major difference between the two versions is that the 
democrats would provide federal funds for school systems to set up 
programs of before and afterschool care based in the public 
schools 
miller who had been in a series of negotiations with the white 
house in a futile effort to reach a bipartisan compromise attacked 
the gop version today as an assault on the public school system 
because it lacks that program 
another sponsor rep thomas downey dny said that program 
providing care for socalled latchkey children who otherwise 
might go unattended would assist middleclass families 
the senate has approved its version of a childcare bill the 
house approved conflicting versions last year and its latest 
debate is an effort to forge a new position 
in both bills the centerpiece is an earned income tax credit 
for lowincome families with at least one parent working 
rep dan rostenkowski dill chairman of the house ways and 
means committee estimated the cost of the leaderships package at 
27 billion over its fiveyear phasein 
but rep clay shaw rfla and other republicans said their 
analysis of the democrats bill put the cost at 313 billion 
the conservative alternative sponsored by shaw and rep charles 
stenholm dtexas was estimated to cost just under 20 billion 
thirtyone billion i think is pretty hard to justify in 
times of scarcity said rep bill frenzel rminn i believe 
youre going too far too fast too big with this 
reps lynn martin rill and louise slaughter dny both 
questioned whether the package of vouchers tax credits and other 
features would actually produce any more child care 
i dont think theres many womens fingerprints on this 
bill slaughter said 
both of the competing versions would permit federal subsidies 
for care provided by religiousbased day care centers even those 
that provide religious instruction and base hiring decisions on 
church membership 
other features of the democratic leaderships bill would expand 
the head start program at a cost of 600 million a year and spend 
29 billion on the social services block grant program to allow 
states to subsidize care including the use of vouchers 
the democratic bill also includes 33 billion to finance a new 
schoolbased program for before and after school care the 
stenholmshaw bill has no such program 
both measures would finance the package in part by reducing or 
eliminating the existing dependent care tax credit for upperincome 
families beginning with those earning 70000 a year 
the democrats would finance part of the package 13 billion 
over five years by extending the excise tax on telephone service 
sponsors acknowledged that the revenue sources they had identified 
would not cover the full cost

a government policy giving women and minority 
groups preferences in the award of broadcast licenses discriminates 
unlawfully against white males and is a failure the supreme court 
was told today 
but lawyers for the federal communications commission and a 
hispanicowned company defended the congressionally sanctioned 
policy as a legitimate means of promoting diversity over the 
airwaves 
the justices heard arguments in cases from florida and 
connecticut that could have major impact on a broad range of 
affirmative action programs the court is expected to rule by july 
gregory h guillot representing a broadcasting company denied a 
license that was awarded to a hispanicowned rival said the fcc 
policy is a complete total failure its bad ineffective and 
unconstitutional 
he also said the policy has increased minority ownership of 
television and radio stations by only one percent in 18 years 
im no mathematician but that means there will be 600 years 
left for the policy to achieve equal racial representation in the 
broadcast industry he said 
margaret polivy a lawyer for the hispanicowned company said 
congress has identified women and minorities as missing voices 
in the mass media and has taken legitimate steps to remedy the 
problem 
achieving equality is a concept that underlies our 
democracy she said 
justice antonin scalia said promoting a colorblind society is 
equally important he said the idea that government benefits should 
not be awarded because of the color of our skin also 
underlies our democracy 
daniel m armstrong representing the fcc said it is vital for 
minorities and women to be given a greater voice in the media 
broadcasting has the power to shape opinion that few 
industries can match he said some raceconscious steps are 
necessary 
the fccs defense of affirmative action has prompted a split 
with the justice department which has raised the specter of 
unconstitutional reverse discrimination and has said the fcc 
programs lack justification 
the high court dealt a major setback to affirmative action last 
year when it struck down a richmond va program that set aside a 
chunk of local public works contracts for minorityowned businesses 
the 63 ruling cast doubt on the constitutionality of numerous 
affirmative action plans of states and cities but had no direct 
bearing on federal programs 
a less conservative high court in 1980 upheld a federal public 
works program that set aside 10 percent of the funds for minority 
contracts that decision said congress has special constitutional 
authority to approve such preferences 
the fcc policies have been the focus of a lengthy dispute 
between congress and federal officials 
the commission adopted the policies when president carter was in 
office but disavowed them during the reagan administration and 
started making plans to dismantle the affirmative action programs 
congress in 1987 barred the fcc from spending money to restudy 
or repeal the policies and that prohibition remains in effect 
at issue in the case from florida is the fcc policy of giving 
minorities and women extra credit when evaluating their 
applications for new television and radio station licenses 
a threejudge panel of the us circuit court of appeals in 
washington upheld preferential treatment in the award of a tv 
license in orlando to the hispanicowned rainbow broadcasting co a 
rival metro broadcasting inc said it should have received the 
license 
in the connecticut case a different panel of the same appeals 
court struck down the fccs socalled distresssale policy that 
policy allows a broadcaster faced with loss of its license to sell 
it to a minorityowned business at 75 percent of market value 
the appeals court overturned the award of a license in hartford 
to hispanicled astroline communications co and gave it instead to 
alan shurberg a nonhispanic 
the justice department in a legal brief filed with the high 
court said the fccs preferential policies lack coherence 
the commissions use of racial preferences remains today as 
much as ever a policy in search of a purpose and an adequate 
supporting record department lawyers said racial 
classifications when imposed by the government must at a minimum 
reflect the deliberate judgment of a competent authority that such 
measures are necessary for specific purposes 
the cases are metro broadcasting vs fcc 89453 and astroline 
communications vs shurger broadcasting 89700

the senate battle to enact tougher air 
pollution controls moved closer to a conclusion today as senators 
debated the effect the bill will have on midwest utilities and coal 
miners 
senate leaders reiterated that they planned to bring the clean 
air bill to a final vote next week after receiving approval from 
fellow senators tuesday night to limit debate on the complex and 
controversial legislation 
several hours of debate today focused on the concerns of midwest 
senators over the cost of proposed acid rain pollution controls on 
utiltities in that part of the country and the effect on 
highsulfur coal miners 
but by a vote of 72 to 25 the senate rejected a proposal that 
would have provided those utilities a 20 percent tax credit if they 
used scrubber technology for pollution control instead of 
switching to other fuels 
the measure was aimed at helping coal miners who stand to lose 
up to 5000 jobs because of the new air pollution controls if 
midwest utilities switch to other fuels 
sen arlen spector rpa sponsor of the bill said the credit 
was needed for midwest utilities to comply with new pollution 
control requirements and avoid severe electric rate increases but 
critics said taxpayers nationwide should not have to help pay for 
cleaning up the midwests dirty power plants 
meanwhile about 500 coal miners and their families rallied 
outside the capitol in a protest against the acid rain provisions 
in the bill saying the requirements would force them out of jobs 
the senate agreed tuesday night to limit debate on the clean air 
bill and bring the measure to a vote next week the agreement 
represented a major step toward passing the first clean air 
legislation by the senate in 13 years 
were clearly now going to finish this bill by a specific 
time senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine said after 
he received his colleagues approval to schedule a final vote for 
april 3 
the pressure now is going to be for the senators to bring 
their remaining amendments to the floor the reality now is that 
time is going to run out said sen bob dole rkan the 
minority leader 
meanwhile in the house the energy and commerce committee 
continues today to consider what is expected to be a string of 
amendments to its clean air legislation rep john dingell 
rmich the panels chairman hopes to send a bill to the floor 
before the easter recess 
the committee was expected today to consider an amendment that 
would require a phasein of alternative fuel vehicles in urban 
areas with the worst smog a similar requirement failed to win 
senate approval 
the announcement by mitchell of a time limit for debating the 
clean air bill came late tuesday after the senate grappled most of 
the day with a proposal to ease permit requirements for businesses 
the senate rejected the measure by a vote of 5047 although 
industry complained the new requirements would create a 
bureaucratic nightmare 
weve been here a long time now and the end is in sight 
declared sen john chafee rri one of the bills floor managers 
the senate began considering the clean air bill in late january 
worked out a compromise with the white house during three weeks of 
closeddoor negotiations and has been debating the compromise since 
march 5 
both the senate and house bills would require a wide range of 
pollution controls on industry automobiles and electric power 
plants in hopes of dramatically reducing acid rain and bringing air 
quality within federal standards in most urban areas by the turn of 
the century 
more than a week ago mitchell was thwarted from getting 
agreement on a time limit for consideration of the bill but 
tuesday night mitchell tried again and this time obtained 
unanimous consent to schedule a final vote for 8 pm next tuesday 
meanwhile behindthescenes discussions continued in an attempt 
to work out an agreement with sen robert byrd dwva over his 
proposal to provide financial assistance to coal miners who lose 
their jobs because of new restrictions under the legislation 
mitchell said if no compromise was reached he planned a vote on the 
byrd proposal for thursday 
byrd earlier had been widely believed to have enough votes to 
pass his amendment but mitchell refused to bring it to a vote 
the white house has called the 500 million measure too 
expensive and mitchell has expressed concern that its passage might 
threaten the overall clean air bill 
democratic and republican sources in the senate suggested 
tuesday that it was unlikely that bush would want to endanger 
enactment of a clean air bill solely because of the coal miner 
assistance provision

japan is considering revising a law that limits the 
opening of of large foreign stores a key issue in trade 
negotiations with the united states government officials indicated 
wednesday 
kabun muto minister of international trade and industry told 
business leaders that anything short of a change in the largescale 
retail store law is unlikely to satisfy us negotiators in next 
weeks trade meetings in washington 
the us is quite adamant on the issue kyodo news service 
quoted muto as saying i am quite worried that our proposal for 
only improving enforcement of the law may not get us off the hook 
at prime minister toshiki kaifus request the government has 
created a series of proposals aimed at satisfying us requests in 
the socalled structural impediments initiative talks the talks 
are aimed at eliminating factors in each countrys economy that 
hinder reductions in their 49 billion trade imbalance 
us and japanese negotiators are to exchange interim reports on 
their progress during the fourth round of the talks set for next 
monday and tuesday in washington 
the united states reportedly has made more than 200 proposals 
for eliminating what it contends are barriers to foreign 
involvement in japans economic and business structure 
government officials have declined to disclose the contents of 
the proposals but have acknowledged that scrapping the largescale 
store law is one of three major us demands 
the law requires large stores to obtain a consensus from small 
local shop keepers before opening a new outlet in a given area 
otherwise the large stores must wait as long as eight or 10 years 
in contrast many japanese retailers such as mitsukoshi and 
tokyu department stores and yaohan supermakets already have opened 
stores in the united states 
in a test of the barriers the government has agreed to consider 
a request by us toy retailer toys r us inc to open a 
53800squarefoot discount store in niigata 160 miles northwest 
of tokyo 
us officials say such largescale stores are more likely to 
carry more foreign products leading to an increase in japans 
imports 
japanese business leaders have expressed strong opposition to 
mutos idea of relaxing the law because it would hurt small shop 
owners 
before we review the law itself we should monitor the 
enforcement of the law first said rokuro ishikawa president of 
the japan chamber of commerce and industry one of japans most 
powerful business organizations 
opposition also has been expressed within the governing liberal 
democartic party against the administrations plan to revise the 
law 
a senior party official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said legislators opposing the change were concerned about losing 
political support from small shop owners who are among the partys 
traditional backers 
i think most of us understand logically that the us demands 
make sense and are good for japan but many politicians are 
reluctant to pay the political cost for the benefit of others he 
said 
also as a party we have to worry about whether we are able to 
win the opposition camps approval to pass a revision of the law in 
parliament he added 
the governing liberal democratic party has the power to decide 
the content of trade proposals japanese negotiators will present to 
their american counterparts in next weeks talks but any legal 
changes must clear the oppositiondominated upper house 
on wednesday finance minister ryutaro hashimoto told that kaifu 
a rapid sharp increase in japans public works spending another 
us proposal was not possible 
the united states has proposed japan increase public works 
spending to 10 percent of gross national product 
the finance minister said he rejected the us demand for the 
increase when he met with us leaders last week in washington

soybean futures prices fell sharply wednesday on 
the chicago board of trade amid heavy speculative selling that 
partly reflected profittaking and greater supply prospects grain 
futures closed moderately lower 
analysts said the soybean selloff began at the opening bell 
when at least two large commodity brokerage houses aggressively 
sold soybean oil contracts triggering a plunge to twoweek lows in 
the oil market 
the selling quickly spread to the adjacent soybean and soybean 
meal pits spurred on by reports of ideal harvesting weather for 
the south american soybean crop and forecasts for beneficial rain 
in the midwest and northern great plains the main regions for us 
soybean corn and spring wheat production 
oil took a big hit on the opening and we never really 
recovered said victor lespinasse a trader in chicago for dean 
witter reynolds inc 
further selling was tied to positioning ahead of fridays 
agriculture department reports on quarterly grain stocks and spring 
planting intentions analysts said 
at the close wheat futures were 2 cents to 4 cents lower with 
the contract for delivery in may at 351 a bushel corn was 2

direction they said

the market in traders said with little prospect on the horizon 
for an improvement in trading conditions

its slump one dealer said

cocoatrading nations agreed wednesday to finance 
a twoyear extension of the cocoa pact that will delay the sale of 
stockpiled beans into the current glutted market 
the finance is guaranteed said west germanys peter baron 
who is chairing talks at the 41nation international cocoa 
organization on the future of the current cocoa pact 
unless the producerconsumer treaty is extended for two years 
from october 1 the organizations 250000ton stockpile must be 
sold off within five years 
this would have serious consequences for prices which are 
already close to their lowest for 14 years following five seasons 
of world overproduction 
the two sides agreed earlier this week to back an extension of 
the agreement but consuming nations said they wanted financing 
settled before giving their formal approval 
following a full meeting of producers and consumers wednesday 
baron said that an overwhelming majority agreed that financing 
should be assured through either payment by producers of some of 
their debts or limited sales from the stockpile during the 
twoyear extension period 
unless producers pay some of their accumulated debts of more 
than 140 million the cocoa organization expects to find itself 
15 million short of the funds needed to finance a twoyear 
extension 
the bulk of the cash will be needed to finance the storage of 
the stockpile until sept 30 1992 
it was agreed wednesday that if the organization came close to 
its financial limits it should be empowered to sell cocoa to 
bridge any gap baron said 
there had been doubts about the producers readiness to accept 
this delegates said 
the organization also agreed in principle that the levy of 30 a 
ton on internationally traded cocoa should cease april 15 baron 
said 
the failure of producers to pay the cocoa organization this levy 
charged on their exports is the cause of their debts 
consuming nations which have been paying the levy on imports 
from noncocoaorganization members have long pressed for its 
cessation 
delegates said wednesday they foresee no problems in a formal 
decision to extend the pact on friday the last scheduled day of 
the talks

former drexel burnham lambert inc junk bond 
wizard michael milken taught math for a day at the 102nd street 
elementary school then handed out calculators to grateful pupils 
arco corp president robert e wycoff sat in the principals 
office at manual arts high school to get a crash course on its 
students 
a gte telephone operations president settled in at bethune 
junior high school while a toyota motors usas senior vice 
president went to north high school in torrance 
more than 40 executives in all participated tuesday in a 
principal for a day program designed in part to help corporate 
america determine what it can do to improve the nations schools 
the los angeles educational partnership the programs sponsor 
has raised 10 million since 1984 to fund projects by innovative 
teachers a program to prevent students from dropping out and the 
introduction of new curriculums 
there is a growing sense of frustration that the reform 
efforts havent worked and that more radical steps are needed 
said virgil roberts the partnerships chairman 
the group hopes to draw attention to the schools through its 
educational partnership week activities 
nationwide businesses have established more than 140000 
partnerships with public schools according to the us department 
of education 
milken who set up his own investment management firm based in 
los angeles last year after leaving drexel has been involved in 
numerous charitable efforts many involving education 
milken left drexel last year after he was indicted on 98 counts 
of securities fraud and racketeering he has pleaded innocent and 
is expected to go to trial in new york on new charges drexel is 
going out of business after its parent filed for bankruptcy 
protection 
arcos wycoff said he was impressed by what he saw tuesday at 
the innercity manual arts high school especially by english 
teacher jo zarros composition class 
i like her i like her enthusiasm is there any way you can 
reward her wycoff asked principal marvin starr only with 
praise starr said 
some educators said there are drawbacks to a corporate presence 
in the classroom 
selfinterest is the primary motivation of most of those 
involved in school reform and at times interests of a particular 
constituency are at odds with what is good for schoolchildren 
said lewis c solmon dean of the graduate school of education at 
the university of california los angeles 
he said some firms are more interested in selling computers 
textbooks and other material than in improving school performance 
but michael w kirst an education professor at stanford 
university said businesses are in schools because they saw the 
work force quality was dropping 
if they were happy with the quality of the public schools they 
would pull back from education and go on to such issues as housing 
transportation or taxes he said

import car dealers counterattacked wednesday as 
chrysler corp chairman lee iacocca continued his road show to tout 
his companys cars as being just as good as japans 
as iacocca visited new york on his sixcity tour in search of 
image and market share the washingtonbased american international 
automobile dealers association accused him of blaming consumers for 
poor sales of us cars 
lee iacocca became famous for ending his commercials by saying 
if you can find a betterbuilt car buy it now he is complaining 
because the american consumers have taken his advice said the 
groups president walter e huizenga 
i was not aware they were outselling us so thats a little 
off base responded chrysler spokesman tom jakobowski 
chryslers 1989 domestic sales totaled 917506 cars among the 
imports honda was closest at 389472 
cars with japanese nameplates made up 258 percent of the us 
car market up from 211 percent in 1982 the share held by the big 
three of chrysler general motors corp and ford motor co slipped 
from 698 percent to 675 percent during that period 
in 1989 for the first time the bestselling car had an import 
nameplate honda accord although 60 percent of honda accords are 
built in the united states 
chrysler has launched national television advertisements 
featuring iacocca contending that chryslers quality was as good as 
japans nobody knows it and thats going to change he says 
in the commercials 
iacocca launched the current sixcity tour earlier this month 
traveling with an array of 1990 chrysler models and executives to 
talk about the cars 
in addition to touting chrysler iacocca has been criticizing 
trade barriers that keep us companies from competing in japanese 
markets 
what we sell in one year in japan they sell in 46 hours here 
this crap has got to stop iacocca said at wednesdays new york 
news conference 
the import association represents 9700 dealers selling japanese 
and other imported cars among other things it lobbies for an end 
to the voluntary import restraints on japanese automakers 
spokesman paul donnellan said 
the free market is an excellent barometer of relative 
automobile quality and the american consumer is an excellent judge 
of that quality they know the quality of imported cars is better 
and they are better no amount of complaining is going to change 
that huizenga said 
the group said japanese vehicles sold under chrysler nameplates 
such as the dodge colt and ram 50 pickup truck accounted for 7 
percent of chryslers 1989 sales it also said more than half the 
400000 plymouth and dodge minivans sold last year had mitsubishi 
engines 
jakobowski said chrysler wasnt bashing imports or telling 
americans not to buy them 
what we are saying is chrysler builds as good a product or 
better he said what we are doing is speaking out to dispel 
the myth that us cars are inferior

richard miller president of wang laboratories 
inc was named the companys new chairman and chief executive 
officer wednesday succeeding the computer makers founder an 
wang who died of cancer last weekend 
the board of directors action was expected by analysts who 
noted that miller already assumed much of the leadership last year 
when he was named president 
miller basically has the future of the company on his 
shoulders said george elling an analyst with merrill lynch amp 
co now we have to see whether his strategy to reestablish 
the company can succeed i think the jury is still out 
miller already has begun reorganizing the company to reverse 
recent losses though he noted wednesday that the current quarters 
loss probably will be larger than originally expected 
also while miller last fall predicted the company could return 
to profitability by the end of its fiscal year on june 30 he said 
wednesday that the company expects losses for the balance of the 
fiscal year 
industry conditions remain extremely difficult miller said 
in a statement but we believe we have in place the programs 
necessary to complete the turnaround 
wangs class b shares closed at 537 wednesday on the new york 
stock exchange down 50 cents millers appointment and comments 
about losses were made shortly before the market closed 
miller a former general electric co executive became 
president last august after wangs son frederick wang was forced 
from the job 
wang posted a 4243 million loss for the year that ended last 
june 30 
wang became a leading computer company largely by making word 
processors but analysts say the lowellbased company stumbled when 
it failed to react quickly to the emergence of personal computers 
in the 1980s which replaced much of the need for word processors 
wang then shifted its strategy to midsize minicomputers but 
that market has been slumping as the smaller desktop computers grow 
more powerful and are being connected in networks 
the company has been floundering the past few years to find a 
strategy elling said the projected deepening losses this 
quarter are not unexpected he said adding the real issue is 
whether they can turn it around if ever 
the wang family expressed support for millers strategies 
we have complete confidence in rick miller and the longterm 
plan now being carried out to return wang laboratories to 
profitability frederick wang said in a statement speaking on 
behalf of his family 
the family effectively has control over the company with the 
power to elect threequarters of the board of directors 
part of millers strategy has been to trim the companys costs 
and reduce its debt through layoffs and selling assets at the same 
time he has declared that the company will be more responsive to 
the needs of customers one of its shortfalls according to 
analysts 
although additional restructuring will occur we have already 
made significant progress miller said 
miller said the company is on target to reduce its bank debt to 
less than 93 million down from 575 million the company also has 
reduced operational expenses by over 300 million annually 
wang now employs about 22500 people compared with 28000 at 
the end of the last fiscal year 
miller will continue serving as the companys president the 
board also elected lorraine c wang wife of the late chairman to 
the newly created position of honorary chairperson mrs wang was a 
founding director of the company

daniel tellep scolds harold simmons in 
fullpage newspaper ads simmons chides tellep in doublepage ads 
their faceoff over who should control lockheed corp will dominate 
the companys annual meeting thursday 
but theres plenty in common between tellep lockheeds 
chairman and simmons who paid 524 million for 19 percent of 
lockheeds stock and who now wants tellep and other board members 
voted out 
each has a big stake in the future of the aerospace giant each 
professes to find promise in that future although their visions 
differ with simmons wanting to carve away far more of the 
companys noncore businesses 
and each has been wooing the big pension funds and other 
institutions that hold 60 percent of the stock in lockheed and 
could provide the margin of victory 
lockheeds stock which traded as high as 5475 during the 
third quarter of 1989 closed at 3687 a share on wednesday 
simmons has shown a paper loss of 100 million on his investment 
obviously i wouldnt have bought the shares we did at 48 or 
49 if id known it was going to fall i would have waited said 
j landis martin simmons chief strategist but were very 
enthusiastic about the prospects for lockheed and for its share 
price particularly if we win 
martin predicted lockheed employees who own about 19 percent of 
the companys stock would back tellep by as much as 95 percent 
that could effectively cancel simmons vote for his 19 percent 
stake leaving the decision to the big investors several of whom 
recently decided to back simmons 
the results of the battle to elect simmons slate of directors 
wont be known until at least next week after proxy votes are 
totaled by a company in delaware the same goes for results of 
votes on shareholders rights proposals simmons backs such as 
elimination of lockheeds takeover defenses 
simmons lockheeds largest shareholder began his proxy battle 
after his request for six seats on the 15person board of directors 
was rejected 
other big shareholders persuaded simmons about 10 days ago to 
accept a compromise to give him three seats but tellep rejected 
that plan when the other shareholders brought it to him martin 
said wednesday 
in an interview monday tellep described meeting with simmons on 
jan 31 he said simmons first demanded six seats and that lockheed 
do away with its poison pill antitakeover provision that makes 
it prohibitively expensive for a hostile buyer to acquire more than 
20 percent of the companys stock 
the failure of the compromise set the stage for a showdown at 
thursdays annual meeting simmons is expected to attend the 
meeting to be held in a hangar not far from the skunk works 
where lockheeds sr71 blackbird spy plane and stealth fighter 
were born 
the company began a major restructuring last year promising to 
become leaner and more competitive in the face of shrinking defense 
budgets it began selling about 200 million in noncore businesses 
lockheed also took nearly 500 million in charges related to 
cost overruns on fixedprice development programs including one 
for a submarinehunting plane that helped depress earnings to 2 
million or 3 cents a share from 624 million or 1037 a share 
the previous year 
now tellep says lockheeds ready for a turnaround 
we did have a tough year last year but i believe the plan 
that we put in place will begin to show results this year he 
said 
simmons also talks about refocusing lockheed on its core 
businesses of space missiles and aeronautics he has strongly 
suggested he will sell 1 billion in less lucrative operations from 
lockheeds technology services and electronic systems divisions 
divestitures tellep says are illadvised at this time 
tellep and simmons have battled in a series of newspaper ads

an excess supply of crude oil in the nations 
storage tanks dragged crude futures prices lower wednesday on the 
new york mercantile exchange while a decline in product 
inventories strengthened gasoline and heating oil prices 
trading in the energy markets was driven mainly by new 
statistics from the american petroleum institute showing a 
higherthanexpected increase in crude stocks and sharply lower 
supplies of refined products including gasoline 
the markets seemed to act just as the apis would dictate 
said stefanie rzasa an energy broker for dean witter reynolds inc 
the may contract for west texas intermediate the main us 
grade of crude oil tumbled 40 cents to 2008 a barrel after a 
2cent rise on tuesday 
contracts for delivery through the summer months also fell 
while later contracts posted small advances 
regular unleaded gasoline for april delivery rose 022 cent to 
5745 cents a gallon and may gained 044 cent to 6456 cents 
contracts for delivery after june were mixed 
no 2 heating oil for delivery in april advanced 040 cents to 
finish at 5573 cents a gallon while later contracts posted losses 
the latest statistics from api the trade association 
representing major oil companies showed gasoline stocks fell 58 
million barrels in the week ended march 23 to 2354 million 
barrels distillate fuel supplies dropped 22 million barrels to 
1036 million while crude oil inventories rose 75 million barrels 
to 3586 million 
jim steel energy analyst for refco inc said seasonal factors 
and the slowdown in refinery operations for annual maintenance in 
recent weeks were largely responsible for the buildup in crude 
supplies and the drop in refined products 
during yearly maintenance demand for crude oil by big oil 
companies declines while at the same time refineries make less 
gasoline oil and other products

the sluggish laser video disc market got a shot 
in the arm wednesday with the announcement that a sony corp 
division has begun making the movie discs in the united states 
the new source of discs could ease a bottleneck that has slowed 
the growth of the technology which provides higherquality 
pictures and sound than videotaped movies the discs are based on 
the same distortionfree digital technique as music compact discs 
digital audio disc corp an indianabased subsidiary of the 
japanese electronics giant said it had begun making the discs at a 
plant in terre haute 
the major maker in the united states of video discs is pioneer 
electronic corp of japan other makers include 3m co and a joint 
venture of nv philips and dupont co 
laser discs require a separate player that is hooked up to a 
television several companies sell combination compact disclaser 
disc players 
but market growth for laser discs and their players has been 
constrained by lack of adequate disc supply said martin greenwald 
president of image entertainment inc of chatsworth calif a 
laser disc distributor 
image entertainment which licenses the laser disc rights to 
movies from major studios has signed a multiyear contract to have 
digital audio disc corp make its discs greenwald said terms were 
not disclosed 
image entertainment also buys discs from other manufacturers 
including pioneer greenwald said but these companies cannot keep 
up demand and image currently has a backlog of about 1 million 
discs on order 
greenwald said his company and the pioneer disc division share 
about 90 percent of the market for distributing laser discs in the 
united states 
greenwald said the move by the sony division into laser disc 
manufacturing is major stepping stone in the growth of laser 
most laser discs are bought by individuals for home use the 
disc rental market is small about 10 percent of total discs sold 
and is not expected to grow substantially for several years until 
the number of laser disc players in homes increases greatly said 
greenwald and james m frische president of digital audio disc 
corp 
currently there are about 500000 laser disc players in us 
homes greenwald said 
industry projections show laser disc players should be in 5 
percent to 10 percent of us households by 1995 compared with a 
vcr penetration rate of about 85 percent by then greenwald said 
but even at this smaller number the market for the discs 
themselves should hit 1 billion a year by then he said 
with an increase in disc manufacturing the cost of the discs 
should drop greenwald said currently they retail for 25 to 40 
digital audio disc is the largest maker of compact discs in this 
country despite the immense growth and popularlity of cds frische 
said he doesnt project the same boom for laser discs anytime soon 
thats partly because they lack the ability to record tv programs 
and so are not a direct replacement for vcrs

cocoa futures prices rocketed to sevenmonth highs wednesday 
amid fears that political and economic crises could disrupt exports 
from the ivory coast and brazil the worlds two largest cocoa 
producers 
uncertainty about brazils changing economic policies also 
underpinned gains in futures prices of sugar and coffee 
on other commodity markets wednesday soybean futures tumbled 
copper futures surged precious metals were mixed petroleum 
futures were mixed and livestock and meat futures advanced 
cocoa futures settled 39 to 47 higher on new yorks coffee 
sugar amp cocoa exchange with the contract for delivery in may at

contract since aug 18 
it was an explosive move one of the biggest moves ive seen 
in a long long time said analyst arthur stevenson of 
prudentialbache securities inc 
civil unrest in the ivory coast the worlds largest cocoa 
producer has kept the market on edge for the past six weeks 
following the implementation of austerity measures aimed at saving 
the onceprosperous west african nation from bankruptcy 
many of the ivory coasts problems stem from last years 
collapse of cocoa and coffee prices to their lowest levels in more 
than a decade 
fears of supply disruptions flared again tuesday on reports of 
clashes between police and protesters whose illegal demonstrations 
paralyzed the capital city of abidjan 
the market was further supported by rumors that the brazilian 
government had suspended all commodity exports while it untangles 
the snarls of red tape created by economic reforms announced nearly 
two weeks ago 
after the markets closed the brazilian government announced 
that coffee and sugar exports were in effect suspended temporarily 
due to the abolition of two government agencies that had been 
responsible for authorizing coffee and sugar shipments 
the government said cocoa exports were not affected by the 
costcutting measures but that cocoa shipments had been moving 
unusually slowly because of seasonal factors 
in addition to the brazilian situation sugar futures were 
supported by expectations that the united states will replace its 
sugar import quota system with a tariff system that could result in 
higher us imports of the sweetener analysts said 
sugar futures settled 20 cent to 26 cent higher with may at 
1559 cents a pound coffee futures rose 49 cent to 83 cent with 
may settling at 9080 cents a pound 
soybean futures fell sharply on the chicago board of trade amid 
heavy selling fueled by reports of ideal harvesting weather for the 
south american soybean crop and forecasts for beneficial rain in 
the midwest and northern great plains the main regions for us 
soybean corn and spring wheat production 
wheat futures settled 3 cents to 5 cents lower with may at 350

bushel oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with may at 145 a 
bushel soybeans were 9 cents to 11 cents lower with may at 588 
a bushel 
copper futures prices soared on new yorks commodity exchange 
partly reflecting a resumption of japanese buying in the physical 
market 
copper settled 19 cents to 425 cents higher with april at 
1205 a pound the march contract expired quietly at 1225 
gold futures finished nearly unchanged on the comex amid 
continuing nervousness after mondays price collapse prices of 
other precious metals continued to slide 
gold ended 10 cents lower to 60 cents higher with april at 
36910 a troy ounce silver was 37 cents to 47 cents lower with 
march at 4917 a troy ounce platinum settled 3 to 370 lower on 
the new york mercantile exchange with april at 47480 a troy ounce 
in petroleum trading on the new york merc west texas

a major figure in the pentagon 
procurement scandal of the 1980s pleaded guilty wednesday to 
bribing a former assistant navy secretary to help an israeli 
company obtain a contract 
the guilty plea by defense consultant william m galvin 59 to 
charges he bribed thenassistant navy secretary melvyn r paisley 
was a significant development in the operation ill wind 
procurement fraud investigation that has netted 35 convictions 
in addition galvin admitted participating in a scheme to bribe 
deputy assistant air force secretary victor d cohen to help 
another defense firm obtain a radardetection contract 
paisley who left the pentagon in april 1987 to go into business 
with galvin has not been charged 
but galvins guilty plea signals that prosecutors are moving 
closer to charging paisley who has already been implicated in a 
separate bribery scheme 
its a major development in the case and we are rapidly moving 
against a number of the people named in the papers said 
assistant us attorney joseph aronica 
galvin who pleaded guilty to conspiracy bribery and tax 
evasion could be sentenced up to 40 years in prison and fined up 
to 1 million us district judge claude m hilton scheduled 
sentencing for aug 3 
galvin agreed to repay 648548 in back taxes and interest owed 
on money he did not report to the internal revenue service 
a year before paisley resigned as assistant navy secretary for 
research engineering and systems he agreed to help an israeli 
company get a contract to sell ground equipment to operate 
remotecontrolled aircraft court papers said 
israel is a major manufacturer of the pilotless intelligence 
planes that carry cameras and other equipment to monitor enemy 
troop movements 
the president of mazlat ltd the israeli company deposited 
50000 in a swiss bank account set up by galvin six days after 
paisley signed a 1986 directive ordering the navy to buy the 
groundcontrol equipment from mazlat instead of another company 
galvin paisley mazlat president zvi schiller and israeli 
defense consultant uri simhoni agreed to share equally the 2 
million that mazlat was to place in the swiss account the figure 
represented 2 percent of the value of the contact court papers 
said 
mazlat deposited 268000 according to the documents 
schiller is a retired israeli army general and once served in 
his countrys military mission to washington simhoni a retired 
army major general was once israeli military attache in 
washington said ruth yaron spokeswoman for the israeli embassy 
former unisys corp executive charles f gardner was sentenced 
last year to 32 months in prison for bribery for arranging the 
purchase of paisleys resort condominium in idaho for an inflated 
price 
paisleys attorney e lawrence barcella said his client 
still maintains his innocence 
galvin also pleaded guilty to participating in a scheme with 
loral electronics corp executive louis oberndorf to bribe cohen to 
help the yonkers nybased company obtain a contract to sell the 
pentagon radarwarning devices 
he admitted paying 123100 in monthly payments between 1983 and 
1987 to a friend of cohens kyle h woodbury for consulting work 
but galvin understood some of the money would be used for cohens 
benefit the court papers said 
galvin helped cohen open a swiss bank account in 1986 which 
cohen concealed from the internal revenue service and the air 
force the court filings said 
neither cohen woodbury nor oberndorf has been charged 
loral pleaded guilty in december to charges that a subsidiary 
tried to influence cohen improperly paying 577 million in fines 
and civil penalties 
cohens lawyer julian greenspun said prosecutors had no 
evidence that his client had participated in a bribery scheme with 
galvin 
i dont think the government can show that kyle woodbury ever 
improperly gave vic cohen a dime said greenspun greenspun said 
the only money woodbury paid cohen was to rent a house from his 
friend

consumers feel more optimistic about future 
business prospects than they did last month but less positive 
about current business conditions according to a survey released 
wednesday 
the conference boards monthly survey showed the most 
significant improvement in consumer confidence in five months the 
business research group said its consumer confidence index for 
march is 1102 a gain of 35 points from february 
the monthly survey conducted by national family opinion inc 
covers 5000 households in the united states 
about 20 percent of respondents feel that current business 
conditions are bad the survey found thats an increase of 2 
percent from last month 
however looking ahead six months people were significantly 
more optimistic about job prospects and business conditions than 
they were in the first two months of the year 
the substantial increase in the number of new jobs in recent 
months has contributed to the increasing sense of job security 
said fabian linden executive director of the boards consumer 
research center this development has also apparently made 
consumers feel more comfortable with the general business outlook 
more people said they intend to buy a car although fewer 
reported they planned to buy a home 
this is most likely a reflection of the recent rise in 
mortgage rates the survey concluded 
interest in buying major appliances also declined 
the conference board is a new yorkbased business group

american telephone amp telegraph co 
will eliminate scores of customersupport centers nationwide as 
part of a previously announced streamlining that will cut 6000 
jobs company officials said wednesday 
the communication workers of america which had been working 
with atampt to eliminate jobs through early retirement rather than 
layoffs criticized the plan and said employees were being treated 
unfairly 
atampt officials however said they had delayed announcing 
details of the streamlining as long as they could while 
negotiations continued when talks with the union broke off 
tuesday the company decided to announce the changes said atampt 
spokeswoman daisy ottmann 
these are jobs that are being eliminated because the work is 
no longer there ms ottmann said from the companys operations 
headquarters here 
under the plan the number of centers will be reduced from about 
160 in 60 metropolitan areas nationwide to about 100 centers in 30 
areas beginning as early as may the company said 
atampt will reduce the number of centers providing direct support 
for business services from 57 to 28 employees at the new customer 
service centers will provide specialized support according to 
customer and type of service rather than geographic area 
in other changes management of the atampt longdistance network 
now handled regionally by 38 centers will be consolidated into six 
centers at two national locations in denver and conyers ga a 
suburb of atlanta 
the changes are part of an 18 billion program begun in 1984 to 
modernize atampts network the company said the changes are designed 
to improve customer service while reducing network operating costs 
it was announced last fall that the streamlining effort would 
reduce about 6000 jobs but details of the plan were announced for 
the first time tuesday 
as atampt increases the installation of new digital technology 
there is less need for all its employees said atampt spokesman burke 
stinson 
until tuesday atampt and the union were negotiating the number of 
employees that would have their pensions sweetened to entice them 
to retire early 
cwa spokesman steve rosenthal said that the frontline employees 
were not being offered as attractive a package as managers were 
last year when a special retirement plan prompted 12500 to depart 
stinson said the company plans to reduce its work force by up to 
12000 employees this year he said he did not know how many would 
be laid off because efforts to entice people to retire early were 
continuing although no new talks with the union were scheduled

blue arrow plc shareholders on wednesday 
overwhelmingly approved changing the companys name to manpower 
plc initiating a plan that will reincorporate the temporary 
employment giant in the united states 
blue arrow chief executive mitchell fromstein said in a 
statement that 99 percent of the votes cast by shareholders were in 
favor of changing the name 
there was a strong demonstration of support for the directions 
of the company fromstein said 
the name change is part of the final chapter of an unsual 
takeover battle that began in 1987 when the british congolmerate 
bought the much larger manpower based in milwaukee in a 13 
billion hostile takeover 
fromstein was president of manpower and was retained in that 
position after the takeover he sat on blue arrows board of 
directors for about a year until he was fired because of what he 
termed a conflict in management philosophies with antony berry 
then blue arrows chief executive 
but blue arrows directors reviewed the dispute between 
fromstein and berry fired berry and named fromstein as chief 
executive a month later 
during the takeover most us investors in manpower sold out to 
blue arrow but since fromstein took over blue arrow us 
investments in the british parent have risen to 75 percent of 
outstanding shares 
in the next stage of fromsteins plan blue arrow is expected to 
reincorporate in the united states as manpower inc divest itself 
of most of its remaining outside holdings and focus on manpowers 
services which comprise 80 percent of the british conglomerates 
current operations 
ultimately its anticipated that we will sell all of the 
nonmanpower operations so that effectively it winds up being back 
what it was back where it was run by who it was two years 
later fromstein said last week 
manpower which provides trained temporary employees to 
companies employs about 1 million people a year it operates 1450 
offices and has 300000 customers worldwide

so that their money can be used to pay off earlier clients in a 
pyramiding scheme that usually collapses as the money owed 
investors grows beyond the companys abilities to recruit new funds 
rooney was accused in an sec complaint jan 2 of diverting the 
profits over a 17year period from the sale of ninemonth 
promissory notes for three companies he controlled 
last thursday us district judge john a nordberg granted an 
sec request for default judgement against rooney including

shareholders 
centaur is seeking to gain seats on national intergroups board 
restructure the company and sell off assets it has claimed it 
could receive 2934 a share by breaking up national intergroup 
love called that figure pure fantasy in his letter and 
advised shareholders to keep the existing board 
centaur said its figure of 2934 a share is based on an 
independent analysis conducted by painewebber inc and is 3 less 
than national intergroups book value 
if you believe that our valuation range is overstated then 
you have either overpaid for businesses as many have asserted or 
have run them down without reflecting this deterioration

national intergroup stock closed at 1687 tuesday down 37 
cents on the new york stock exchange 
centaur also criticized national intergroup management and said 
the company has lost 450 million in six years

the world bank which has been lending as much 
as 2 billion annually to china plans to restrict the aid to basic 
human needs assistance a high treasury official told congress on 
wednesday 
we do not see at this stage a major resumption of nonbhn 
basic human needs lending in the immediate plans of the bank 
management said charles h dallara assistant secretary of the 
treasury for international affairs 
dallara said the treasury had resisted pressure during the 
banks recent closeddoor meetings to increase lending 
weve made very clear that in our sense a lending program 
should be one that is modest moderately paced and limited in the 
foreseeable future strictly to basic human needs he added in 
testimony before the house banking subcommittee on international 
development 
meanwhile another us economic expert argued that continued 
commercial ties with china can help stimulate reforms 
the administration has searched for a balance between an 
adequate expression of moral disapproval and actions that reflect 
longterm us interests said john macomber chairman of the 
us exportimport bank 
macomber said that his bank had financed three projects in china 
this year worth 728 million 
in recent weeks the world banks 152 member governments have 
approved three loans worth 140 million to china for earthquake 
relief aid to poor farmers and vocational education 
the world bank is the biggest source of aid to third world 
countries and the united states makes the largest contribution but 
does not have a veto over loans 
barber b conable the banks president suspended consideration 
of 780 million worth of loans when chinese tanks went into 
tienanmen square last june however he did not stop disbursement 
of loans already granted 
conable has said he wants 1 billion worth of new loans to china 
to go forward by june 
but dallara said that would cause concern among us officials 
because the only way so large an amount could be loaned would be by 
going beyond basic human needs 
delegate walter e fauntroy ddc chairman of the subcommittee 
warned that a proposed us contribution of 318 billion might be 
in trouble with congress if the bank resumed large scale lending to 
china 
the contribution would go to the banks international 
development association which makes 40year loans at a less than 1

pathe communications corp which 
has agreed to buy mgmua communications co for 129 billion said 
its profits fell 12 percent in the fourth quarter and reported a 
32 million loss for the full year 
pathe which produces and distributes entertainment worldwide 
and operates movie theaters in europe also said wednesday its 
20ashare tender offer for mgmua is expected to be completed in 
april 
the company already has made a 50 million deposit and has 
signed a distribution deal worth 75 million to mgmua but has yet 
to announce how it intends to finance the buyout 
combining these two companies into a truly global organization 
will produce both substantial entertainment and meaningful 
financial results in the future said giancarlo parretti the 
italian financier who is pathes president and chief executive 
the future looks extremely promising 
for the octoberdecember quarter pathe earned 22 million or 
37 cents a share compared with 25 million or 212 a share in 
the same period in 1988 revenue fell 29 percent to 79 million 
from 111 million 
earnings per share declined more sharply than overall net 
because pathe had an average of about 60 million shares outstanding 
in the fourth quarter compared with 11 million a year earlier 
for the year pathes 32 million loss the equivalent of 113 
a share compared with a profit of 21 million or 157 a share 
in 1988

revenues from cinema operation rose 10 percent to 167 million but 
movie distributing income fell 17 percent to 185 million pathe 
said 
yearly profits were depressed by 47 million in charges taken 
because of a lowered estimate of future revenues from the companys 
old film library and 14 million for films over 5 years old that 
were fully amortized in 1989 it said

a house committee moved wednesday to more than 
double president bushs request for aid to emerging democracies in 
eastern europe to soften the shocks of changing from communism to a 
market economy 
it would be a very serious mistake for us to conclude the 
survival of democracy in eastern europe is a done deal said rep 
stephen solarz dny who offered an amendment in the foreign 
affairs committee boosting potential aid to the region to 719 
million in the year that begins oct 1 
the adopted the aid boost on a voice vote adding it to an 
omnibus foreign affairs bill 
at the same time the house speeded progress of legislation bush 
has sought to aid new democracies in central america the chamber 
was to consider a 24 billion money bill which includes 420 
million for panama and 300 million for nicaragua on thursday 
the administration has agreed to pay for the panama and 
nicaragua aid by cutting a list of pentagon projects and accounts 
totaling 18 billion 
the new amount for eastern europe compares with 300 million the 
white house has sought for next year the administration argues 
that the smaller amount would be as much as countries like poland 
and hungary which have progressed far enough in their reforms to 
be eligible for us help can absorb immediately 
solarz however said his package of environmental cleanup aid 
housing grants and loan guarantees and private sector development 
assistance is needed to soften the cold turkey switch from 
centrally planned economies to market systems 
east european countries will suffer severe shocks as they close 
down inefficient governmentowned enterprises throwing people out 
of work and switch to private employment he said 
it could create a socially and politically explosive 
situation he told the committee we need to do more than weve 
done so far 
rep lee hamilton dind agreed we have a unique 
opportunity to achieve goals weve sought for 40 or 50 years he 
said the stakes are enormous the risk is that we wont be bold 
enough in meeting the challenge 
hamilton acknowledged there is a shortage of money for new 
programs particularly in the area of foreign aid but he added 
the american people have been fired by the changes in eastern 
europe and want to see freedom triumph weve simply got to 
find the resources to play the role of a world leader 
solarzs amendment was added to a catchall foreign aid bill 
that includes implementing provisions needed to permit emergency 
shortterm aid to new democratic governments in panama and 
nicaragua as well as authorization for an additional 200 million 
to nicaragua next year 
the sums mentioned are spending ceilings congress must still 
appropriate the money and may appropriate any amount up to the 
ceiling 
it was approved on a voice vote after republicans sarcastically 
feigned an effort to double solarzs aid figure we must act 
boldly and with great fanfare intoned rep william broomfield 
rmich before withdrawing his amendment 
republicans believe democrats are using eastern europe as a 
political weapon portraying bush as weak by continually increasing 
aid beyond amounts the white house asks a similar scenario last 
year led to a quadrupling of bushs request 
the fate of the bill remained unclear the house committee 
planned to hold it over until next week pending the outcome of 
planned talks between secretary of state james a baker iii and 
lawmakers concerned about human rights issues in el salvador 
the senate foreign relations committee meanwhile adopted a 
pareddown version wednesday that largely tracked the 
administrations panamanicaragua request and added no provisions 
on unrelated matters such as eastern europe
