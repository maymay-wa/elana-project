the us supreme court refused late 
thursday to lift a stay of execution for man who killed an inmate in 
a dispute over a diamond ring marking the second time the mans 
execution has been blocked against his wishes 
in a ruling handed down shortly after 9 pm cst the supreme 
court denied the states motion to vacate a stay that had been 
issued to gerald smith earlier thursday by the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals in st louis 
in a 73 ruling handed down about 5 pm in st louis the court 
said it needed more time to review smiths case including the issue 
of whether he is competent to abandon his appeals smith had been 
scheduled to die at 1201 am friday 
the execution would have been the first in missouri since 1965 
the first under the states 11yearold reinstated capital 
punishment law and the first use of lethal injection a change from 
the former gas chamber 
smith 30 has said he wants to die now rather than spend years 
on death row awaiting the inevitable 
smiths wife lynn filed a petition with the court earlier 
thursday seeking to stop the execution contending smith is not 
competent to abandon his appeals the missouri public defenders 
commission had asked the us supreme court for a stay 
smith was sentenced to die for the 1985 stabbing death of inmate 
robert baker he also had been scheduled to die oct 4 for the 1980 
beating death of karen roberts a former girlfriend but the 8th 
circuit stayed that execution saying it needed more time to 
determine if smith was competent to abandon his appeals 
authorities said baker was killed in a dispute over a diamond 
ring although smith said he committed the murder so he could be 
executed smith has said he killed ms roberts because she gave him 
a venereal disease and caused him to lose his fiancee 
last month mrs smith stood by her husband in his decision to 
abandon his appeals but recently decided to challenge his 
competency and try to get the latest execution halted mrs smith a 
registered nurse from california got to know smith through letters 
and married him last year in the prison 
gerald smith is a very sick and emotionally disturbed young man 
who is not competent to decide whether to abandon his appeals and 
acquiesce in his execution said mrs smiths motion for a stay 
the states response contended smiths competency has already 
been established and criticized mrs smith for her eleventh hour 
request for a stay 
in a telephone interview from the prison wednesday smith said 
his wife had joined forces with those trying to save him because she 
had been brainwashed 
apparently they told her it would come off and she is their 
only chance to stop it smith said they told her that with her 
there is a 90 percent chance of stopping it 
smith has vowed to start a hunger strike and threatened to commit 
violence against others if his execution is halted by the courts

major central banks came to the dollars rescue 
thursday in a united buying spree that stabilized the weakening 
currency but analysts warned the recovery might be shortlived 
because of continued concerns about the us trade and budget 
deficits 
the coordinated worldwide buying of dollars by central banks 
appeared to be the heaviest since the spring and it lent some 
support to the slumping stock market which has been keeping a keen 
eye on dollar activity 
on wall street the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks 
closed up 1387 points at 205245 but the rebound still left the 
markets best known measure down about 75 points over seven sessions 
bond prices slipped pushing interest rates higher the yield on 
the treasurys bellwether 30year bond rose to 915 percent from 
911 percent although some analysts blamed the decline on the 
treasurys auction of longterm bonds thursday rather than the 
action in the currency markets 
investors in the financial markets worry that a weak dollar could 
drive up interest rates and spark higher inflation since it would 
raise prices of imports and some domestic commodities 
currency traders said the centralbank intervention began without 
much success in tokyo as heavy buying of the dollar by the bank of 
japan did not keep the us currency from dropping to a near 40year 
low of 1215 yen 
the federal reserve bank began selling yen for dollars in new 
york and the west german bundesbank also bought up dollars to 
reduce the supply of the us currency on the market traders said 
the central banks of britain switzerland france italy austria 
and other nations then joined in 
the dollar rebounded to about 1226 yen in europe before slipping 
to 1222 in new york the dollar gained ground against all other 
major currencies 
on friday morning in japan the dollar opened at 12215 yen and 
by midmorning was trading at about 12223 yen

british prime minister margaret thatcher said 
thursday the recent palestine liberation organization policy 
statement offers signs of hope that should be explored through a 
revived middle east peace effort 
at a news conference mrs thatcher said acceptance by the plo 
parliament in exile of two key united nations resolutions on the 
middle east represents a modest step forward on which progress 
toward peace could be made 
and in a separate interview with reporters and editors of the 
washington post and newsweek magazine the prime minister declared 
that the policies of soviet president mikhail gorbachev have ended 
the cold war between the east and the west 
at a news conference shortly before ending her twoday visit 
here mrs thatcher offered a slightly more upbeat appraisal of the 
declaration by the palestine national council than the reagan 
administration 
the state department said wednesday more movement on key 
issues will be required by the plo before the united states 
regards it as ready to participate in the middle east peace process 
but mrs thatcher said the indications of plo flexibility should 
be encouraged otherwise you wont get further moves 
she called for a strenuous effort including heavy pressure 
on both israel and the arabs to get peace negotiations started 
on the specifics of the declaration mrs thatcher indicated that 
she shares the administrations views 
while offering restrained praise for the pnc stand on un 
security council resolutions 242 and 338 mrs thatcher said she 
opposes the pnc proclamation establishing an independent state and 
added the declaration did not go far enough in repudiating terrorism 
obviously there are a lot of things in it that none of us 
like she said 
the two un resolutions call for israeli withdrawal from 
occupied territories and asserts the right of all countries in the 
area to live within secure borders 
the administration has said the plo declaration on the 
resolutions was an advance compared with previous statements 
but it said the council declaration as a whole falls short of us 
requirements for opening a dialogue with the plo 
during the hourlong interview with the washington post and 
newsweek mrs thatcher said were not in a cold war now but in 
a new relationship much wider than the cold war ever was 
according to a story in the posts friday editions 
gorbachevs policies have affected eastwest relations 
profoundly mrs thatcher said adding that the previous minimal 
relationship with moscow that focused on arms control has expanded 
to include trade culture and other major issues 
i expect mr gorbachev to do everything he can to continue his 
reforms she said we will support it 
at the news conference mrs thatcher reaffirmed her high regard 
for presidentelect george bush citing his extensive experience in 
government as a major asset 
you will have a president who doesnt have to be briefed she 
said 
she said bush has carried out his many missions to europe as vice 
president superbly including his effort to ensure us 
intermediaterange missiles were installed in allied countries on 
time in 1983 
before a breakfast meeting with bush on thursday mrs thatcher 
said she had not the slightest shadow of a doubt that bush will 
deal responsibly with the budget deficit 
she offered similar expressions of confidence in bush and the 
us economy in network television interviews she had at her 
temporary residence in the blair house across the street from the 
white house

a prosecutor told jurors wednesday that 
reputed mob boss nicodemo little nicky scarfo and 16 associates 
should be convicted of racketeering based on their own recorded 
words 
defense lawyers in their final arguments said the government 
relied on liars and hearsay to form its case 
according to the defendants all the witnesses lied and the 
defendants tell you that the mafia is a figment of the imagination 
of informants delgiorna and caramandi assistant us attorney 
arnold gordon said now that is not true there is a mob the 
evidence has proven it 
gordons statements came after the jury heard from the last of 
the defense lawyers robert simone who represents scarfo 
the 59yearold scarfo who authorities say heads the mafia in 
the philadelphiasouthern new jersey area and his 16 associates are 
standing trial on federal racketeering charges which include 
allegations of nine murders extortion and loan sharking 
the jurors sequestered since the twomonth trial began are 
scheduled to receive instructions from us district judge franklin 
vanantwerpen thursday morning before beginning deliberations 
simone suggested the government was trying to prove his client 
guilty through newspaper stories identifying scarfo as a mob boss 
not by evidence 
thats how they want to prove the mafia exists and thats how 
they want to prove his guilt simone said 
simone like the other defense lawyers hammered hard at the two 
star government witnesses thomas delgiorno and nicholas caramandi 
both accepted government plea bargains and are under government 
protection 
is it possible for you to remove from your notes or remove from 
your minds the testimony of caramandi and delgiorno and other 
government witnesses simone asked if you do you will find 
that the government case will collapse like a house of cards 
but gordon noted that besides the testimony the government 
presented 15 to 20 hours of secretly recorded conversations 
you heard scarfo on the tape and what he was talking about 
with others gordon said they were talking about the mafia 
their words 
it is on the basis of those words that the government wants you 
to find these defendants guilty not on newspaper articles 
gordon acknowledged that a good deal of the evidence came from 
the two informants 
the defense would like you to believe that delgiorno and 
caramandi told you lies and that there is no case but that is not 
true gordon said 
gordon acknowledged that the two witnesses were criminals but 
said they were government witnesses because thats how you 
prosecute mob members 
lawabiding citizens dont associate with the kind of people 
the evidence shows these defendants are the only people who can 
tell you about the mob and how it works are people inside the mob 
people like caramandi and delgiorno are not found among honest 
citizens they are found in the sewers of the underworld 
on the basis of testimony from delgiorno and caramandi a year 
ago scarfo and former city councilman leland beloff were convicted 
of trying to extort 1 million from a developer

japanese wine lovers plunged into the first batch of 
frances 1988 beaujolais nouveau early today marking the start of 
what industry officials predict will be a record year in sales of 
the wine in japan 
a fleet of more than 400 trucks loaded to the brim with cases of 
new beaujolais spread out across tokyo to deliver the red burgundy 
to restaurants and distributors following its release by customs 
because the distribution embargo on the wine was lifted at 
midnight local time around the world tokyoites received their 
beaujolais nouveau eight hours ahead of parisians 
corks popped and wine glasses brimmed over at one of the first 
beaujolais nouveau parties of the year at le maestro a french 
restaurant in tokyo 
shigeta saito a wellknown psychiatrist and one of some 30 
guests at the restaurant led the toast by announcing the 
beaujolais nouveau of 1988 has arrived bravo 
the 72yearold saito who says he indulges in all types of 
alcoholic beverages said he came to the earlymorning gathering

with the newest batch of wine released every fall following the 
grape harvest 
hiroshi yamamoto lawyer and organizer of the winetasting said 
beaujolais nouveau a newly fermented wine appeals to japanese wine 
drinkers because it contains less tannin than wine fermented for

nouveau wine up from 12000 cases last year to meet the growing 
thirst of japanese wine drinkers said kiyoshi inoue a spokesman 
for suntory 
japanese consumers who already pay the worlds highest food and 
beverage prices will be expected to put up with hefty price tags on 
the new beaujolais

nasa pronounced the space shuttle 
atlantis ready to fly and set dec 1 as its launch date but the 
space agency isnt divulging the liftoff time or length of the 
secret defense department mission 
rear adm richard truly nasas associate administrator for space 
flight made the announcement wednesday following a twoday flight 
readiness review of the mission which will carry five military 
astronauts and a spy satellite 
the launch will be the second for the shuttle program since the 
challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts in january 1986 
following a 32month period of major modifications the program 
resumed sept 29 with the successful launch of discovery and a 
fiveman crew 
i am pleased to report that the space shuttle atlantis is as 
ready to fly as discovery was at this same point before its flight 
last september truly said 
the publicity that heralded discoverys flight will be missing 
for atlantis with nasa and the pentagon cloaking most information 
in secrecy because of the military payload 
the exact launch time and length of the mission will not be 
disclosed in advance and once atlantis is in orbit there will be a 
news blackout until the landing defense officials said the secrecy 
would make it more difficult for soviet ground and space systems to 
monitor the launch and the deployment of the payload 
sources said they expect a liftoff about 7 am est and report 
the astronauts will deploy an intelligencegathering satellite whose 
assignments include helping american intelligence officials verify 
that the soviets are complying with arms control treaties

several experiments aimed at defining mans role as a military 
observer in space

requiring prospective handgun owners to wait 15 days before picking 
up their weapons

cities in that it applies to handgun sales by individuals as well as 
dealers gardiner said that without seeing a copy of cincinnatis 
law he could not say whether the nra would try to challenge it in 
the courts 
some other cities and states including california also require 
waiting periods before allowing purchase of handguns 
the us house on sept 15 rejected a proposed sevenday waiting 
period

bok choy and escarole arent crops for every 
farmer but an agriculture department economist says such exotic 
food items are catching the eye of supermarket shoppers 
increasingly produce counters are also including fruits that are 
a bit off the trodden path of consumers pomegranates guava 
kumquats and melons named santa clause casaba and crenshaw 
specialty fruit and vegetable displays form a fundamental part 
of the new upscale image of many produce sections said catherine 
greene of the departments economic research service 
rising demand for specialty produce is in line with a general 
increase in fruit and vegetable consumption she said the average 
american consumed 427 pounds of fruits and vegetables last year up 
12 percent since 1972 that is a farm weight equivalent before 
trimming processing and afterharvest losses she said wednesday 
greene said the per capita trend is expected to continue upward 
although there could be some yeartoyear variations for example 
she said this years drought probably will cause some decline from 
the 1987 average 
in any case specialty fruits and vegetables are the rage among 
many consumers and there is no sign the demand will taper off soon 
greene writing in the agencys national food review said there are 
a number of reasons 
americans have become more health conscious eating lots of 
fruits and vegetables as part of a wellbalanced diet she said 
consequently we want a huge selection of produce 
further americans travel more frequently than they used to and 
many want foreign foods when they return home 
unusual fruits and vegetables are appearing on restaurant 
menus greene said also influencing our diets are recent 
immigrants from the caribbean central america and southeast asia 
who have brought their native foods with them 
a recent survey by the industrys food marketing institute showed 
that the number of items sold in supermarket produce departments 
more than doubled to 150 between the mid1970s and the early 1980s 
today more than 250 items is the norm including new packs and 
sizes of traditional fruits and vegetables along with exotic and 
specialty produce 
another survey conducted for a trade journal the packer showed 
the most frequently tried specialty fresh vegetables were alfalfa 
and bean sprouts followed by snow peas pearl onions parsnips 
leeks baby vegetables chinese cabbage and shallots 
moreover about a third of those surveyed also had seen or heard 
of less widely known specialty vegetables such as belgian endive 
bok choy celeriac daikon kohlrabi parsley root and jerusalem 
artichoke 
the most frequently tried specialty fresh fruits in order were 
pomegranates persimmons kumquats quince and guavas 
additionally at least a third of those surveyed had seen or 
heard of breadfuit passion fruit plantains prickly pear and red 
bananas but some fruits were nearly unkown asian pears 
carambolas cherimoyas sapotes radiccho and rappini 
greene said the survey showed that consumers in the western 
united states are more likely to try specialty produce and fresh 
herbs another group of growth items one factor is the wests large 
asian and hispanic populations with their interests in exotic 
produce 
also it was shown that consumers in the upper income brackets 
eat more of the speciality fruits and vegetables 
they may be better informed about the variety of produce 
available and better able to afford the premium prices that 
specialities sometimes command greene said

the agriculture department says the value of 
us agricultural exports jumped 26 percent to a fouryear high of 
352 billion in the fiscal year that ended on sept 30 
actual quantities of grain and other commodities totaled 1475 
million metric tons up 14 percent from 1292 million tons shipped 
in 198687 when the value was 279 billion 
the new figures released wednesday were up from the previous 
forecast issued on aug 25 when the value was projected at 34 
billion and the volume at 146 million tons 
despite the sharp gains the years totals were still far below 
the record levels of 438 billion and 1623 million tons in 198081 
before world economic conditions high interest rates foreign 
competition and other economic factors triggered annual declines 
deputy secretary peter c myers credited the 1985 farm laws 
lower price support mechanisms with making us commodities more 
competitive in world trade 
myers said a decline in food prices last month proves that 
export increases did not occur at the expense of us consumers 
despite this summers damaging drought 
the usda says higher commodity prices point to another increase 
in the value of exports in the fiscal year that began on oct 1 but 
it says the actual volume may decline 
a forecast of 1989 farm exports is scheduled for release on nov 
29 
wheat accounted for twothirds of the volume increase last fiscal 
year and significant increases were reported for corn 
livestock feed and fodder and vegetable oils 
overall exports of grains and feeds accounted for more than 
127 billion of the total up 37 percent 
other categories included oilseeds and products 77 billion 
up 19 percent livestock products 49 billion up 24 percent 
horticultural products 38 billion up 21 percent cotton 215 
billion up 50 percent and tobacco 13 billion up 8 percent

at least 12 mariel prisoners have apparently 
exhausted their administrative appeals and could be deported within 
days but plans are in the works by prisoner advocates to block any 
deportations a newspaper reported thursday 
gary leshaw director of the nonprofit atlanta legal aid 
organization representing mariel detainees said he was informed by 
the justice department that there would be an announcement thursday 
on the prisoners 
meanwhile prisoner advocate groups in miami and atlanta plan to 
ask federal judges to stop the deportations which if carried out 
would mark the first time cubans have been deported to their 
communist homeland since may 1985 the miami herald reported 
there is a chance if we all speak with one united voice here 
and explain the merits of our case said rafael penalver chairman 
of the task force of cuban american citizen organizations 
penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end 
riots by 3800 mariel detainees in oakdale la and at an atlanta 
prison last november we will appeal to president reagan he can 
block the deportations even if the people are sitting in an 
airplane at the airport 
a special threemember justice department panel was created in 
the aftermath of the riots to review the cases of 113 mariel 
detainees in federal prison in talladega ala in the past two 
months the panel has looked at prison records immigration history 
written statements from the prisoners and other materials but there 
have been no personal appearances by the prisoners or their lawyers 
deportations to cuba were reinstated as part of a renewed 
immigration pact between the united states and cuba that allows up 
to 20000 cubans and 3000 political prisoners and their families to 
emigrate and in return the cuban government will take back 2500 
prisoners 
the justice department contends that these prisoners are 
criminals the cuban regime injected into a boatlift of refugees from 
the port of mariel 
prisoners selected for deportation are being taken from a list of 
mariel inmates who were imprisoned at the time of the 1984 
immigration pact 
jorge mas canosa chairman of the cubanamerican national 
foundation acknowledges there is much division over the 
deporations even in dade countys cuban exile community 
he said the foundation favors letting cubans apply for visas to 
immigrate to the united states but opposes the deportations to cuba 
i cannot in one hand denounce the human rights situation in 
cuba and then support sending them back mas said

justice department officials have postponed 
initial indictments in the massive pentagon purchasing fraud scandal 
while they debate whom to charge first 
we expect action in the very near future but not this week and 
probably not next week said sharon dibbley spokeswoman for us 
attorney henry hudson in suburban alexandria va where the more 
than 2yearold investigation is headquartered 
last month hudson and justice sources predicted that the first 
indictments would be brought by midnovember but now the best 
estimates are that the grand jury will vote on charges either very 
late in november or in early december 
a source at justice department headquarters said wednesday 
its still being reviewed here over legal issues 
another government source added it was anticipated that 
something would happen tomorrow and it will not happen tomorrow 
justice department spokesman john russell said assistant attorney 
general edward dennis head of the criminal division has never 
set a timetable hes told them to take their time and go when the 
case is in shape 
prosecutors say they have evidence that consultants including 
some former highlevel reagan administration officials and former 
highranking military men who work for the nations largest defense 
contractors bribed pentagon officials for information vital to 
winning contracts worth billions of dollars 
two corporations and three individuals were identified this week 
by government and defense sources as among the potential targets of 
the first charges 
these sources said consultants william parkin and fred lackner 
had been offered plea bargains by prosecutors but the pair had 
declined to plead guilty to the charges offered those charges 
included conspiracy and bribery the sources said 
the sources also said prosecutors were weighing charges against 
teledyne inc and hazeltine corp both of which were searched in 
fbi raids last june 
the sources also suggested that charges were being contemplated 
against stuart berlin a procurement specialist with the naval air 
systems command berlin and four other pentagon employees have been 
transferred away from contract work 
other sources however had said earlier that no government 
employee would be among the first group charged 
parkin has said he paid lackner 15000 to 18000 in late 1986 
for information on a pending navy contract for equipment to 
distinguish hostile and friendly aircraft parkin said he then 
turned the information over to hazeltine on long island ny 
parkin said he concluded the information came from berlin but 
that it was not secret 
parkin also has said he split fees with lackner from teledyne 
electronics of newbury park calif which was seeking an air force 
contract but parkin said they did not have to do any work in that 
case 
lackners attorney william dougherty said his client never 
gave anybody a nickel 
berkley baker a teledyne spokesman said we were told this 
week by the justice department that they have made no decision yet 
we are not going to respond to unofficial statements from the 
government when the government has an official statement we will 
respond 
jim orso a spokesman for hazeltine said we are not 
commenting on the investigation in any form 
berlin could not be reached for comment 
some observers have questioned whether hazeltine and teledyne 
should be included in the same indictment because they did not 
compete for the same contracts even though they employed the same 
consultants 
one justice source said there were legal arguments on both sides 
of that question and the arguments and theories were changing 
regularly in the complex case 
these things tend to change almost daily as you sift the 
evidence this source said but we dont want to end up with 30 
trials 
hudson has said charges could be brought over a period of up to a 
year 
at the justice department william hendricks chief of the fraud 
section said the department is simply interested in ensuring 
that any actions taken are done diligently and aggressively but with 
care and to insure propriety

dave obrien needed help and he got plenty of 
it from some big names in the democratic party paul simon bill 
bradley joe biden they all were eager to help obrien in his 
campaign to unseat republican rep tom tauke 
their appearances werent enough obrien got only 36 percent of 
the vote on election day 
but for sens simon bradley and biden the effort wasnt wasted 
for them a chance to campaign in iowa to make a few friends in the 
state that holds the nations first presidential caucuses every four 
years is no waste of time 
other familiar democratic faces who campaigned in iowa in 1988 
were jesse jackson rep richard gephardt of missouri the winner of 
the 1988 iowa caucuses and former gov bruce babbitt of arizona 
sen albert gore jr of tennessee bypassed iowa during the caucus 
campaign and later as well but he was on the road elsewhere 
with the exception of bradley those are all leftover names from 
1988 
jackson gephardt and gore are considered likely contenders for 
the 1992 democratic nomination 
michael dukakis the defeated 1988 democratic nominee was back 
at a job i love being governor of massachusetts at his 
appearances immediately after his defeat supporters chanted 92 
92 92 but dukakis refused to discuss the possibility of 
another presidential campaign 
texas sen lloyd bentsen became something of a folk figure as the 
democratic vice presidential candidate and presumably will receive a 
lot of early attention as a prospect for the top spot on the ticket 
in four years but bentsen will be 71 years old in 1992 
another familiar name that comes up every four years is gov 
mario cuomo of new york twice hes been mentioned and twice hes 
declined to run 
gov bill clinton of arkansas decided against running n 1988 but 
is certain to take another look 
he doesnt know what hell be doing in four years said 
spokesman mike gauldin 
sen sam nunn of georgia a favorite of southern conservatives 
also considered a 1988 run and opted out 
its premature to be talking about personalities in 92 me or 
anybody else said nunn 
its much too early premature and downright immature to be 
talking about 1992 politics said jackson when it became clear on 
election night that dukakis was going down to defeat 
but while twotime presidential candidate jackson brushed off 
talk about 1992 he already has formed a political action committee 
keep hope alive and declared his intention to be involved in 
municipal elections in 1989 hes certain to be involved in the 
highprofile battle for mayor of new york where incumbent ed koch 
will face a strong challenge fueled in part by his bitter clash with 
jackson during the 1988 new york presidential primary 
democratic party chairman paul g kirk jr hopes the potential 
1992 candidates are serious when they say its premature to start 
the next presidential campaign 
our focus ought to be on 1990 said kirk who called that the 
key year for determining which party has the edge when congressional 
and legislative redistricting takes place after the 1990 census 
that process occurring once every 10 years is certain to shift 
more house seats from the rust belt to the sun belt and force a 
redrawing of lines that could change the political makeup of scores 
of house districts 
maybe kirk can keep democrats focused on redistricting 
but as he is well aware the first poll assessing the potential 
1992 field is almost certain to be taken before christmas 1988

george bushs role in next months meeting 
between president reagan and soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev will 
be as vice president and any discussions about bushs future 
dealings with the kremlin leader will be fairly brief a 
spokesman said 
bush the presidentelect will be attending the talks in new 
york with reagan when the soviet leader is in town to address the 
united nations 
it should not be expected that the meeting is being designed as 
a summit or designed with a set of objectives in mind that would be 
the kinds of things that we would hope for in a future meeting 
craig fuller a codirector of bushs transition team said 
wednesday 
he said bush would be prepared to take stock of ussoviet 
developments over the past eight years 
he will particpate in the meeting as vice president fuller 
said 
were not certain exactly what the scenario is going to be for 
those discussions but any discussion they have about the future i 
think will be fairly brief and will be designed merely to set the 
stage for each others approach with regard to meetings in the 
months ahead fuller added 
fuller commented at a news conference where the bush team also 
announced that all people involved in his transition are being asked 
to sign a code of conduct pledging they will not leak any news about 
assignments in the new administration and will avoid any conflict of 
interest 
after talks today with british prime minister margaret thatcher 
and a separate meeting with reagan bush returns to the job of

social security benefits to people born before 
1917 are higher than congress intended but theres no practical way 
to fix the inequity a study concludes 
congress should neither reduce benefits to those getting the 
unintended windfall nor raise them for everyone else said the study 
released wednesday by the nonpartisan national academy of social 
insurance 
i would strongly hope that this issue can be put to rest as a 
result of the report said suzanne dilk a former senior analyst 
with the social security administration and one of four experts on 
the study panel 
in a related development lawmakers and lobbyists reacted angrily 
to a draft government proposal that would make it harder for the 
elderly disabled and poor to appeal government decisions denying 
them welfare or social security benefits 
the proposed rule still under review would require people to 
submit all evidence at least seven days in advance of a hearing 
before an administrative law judge current regulations permit new 
evidence to be introduced during or after the hearing 
the benefits report focused on a category of social security 
recipients known as notch babies those born between 1917 and 
1921 it said their benefits in some cases are as much as 200 a 
month less than those of people born earlier but the notch babies 
are receiving the level of benefits congress intended and in fact 
are at an advantage compared to people born after them the report 
concluded 
the inequity the report said lies in the fact that those born 
before 1917 are getting higher benefits than congress intended not 
that others are receiving too little 
the notch or discrepancy in benefits arose when congress 
adopted a new formula meant to keep rising social security benefits 
at a constant percentage of a persons average preretirement 
earnings 
however people born before 1917 were allowed to use the old 
overgenerous method of calculation the result a benefit rate that 
peaked in 1981 at 56 percent of average earnings about 15 
percentage points higher than what congress had intended 
robert myers chairman of the study panel and formerly executive 
director of the national commission on social security reform said 
there are probably about 1 million notch babies feeling 
substantial impact from the situation 
he estimated it would cost up to 300 billion to equalize 
everyones benefits and that would create new notches affecting 
those born in later years he said it would be difficult and 
expensive to find the individuals who got windfalls not to mention 
politically impossible to cut their benefits 
we are not in favor of keeping a discrepancy in the law said 
panel member james kelley former staff director to the house ways 
and means committees social security subcommittee but he added 
you find a member of congress who wants to lower benefits 
good luck 
many on capitol hill meanwhile reacted angrily wednesday to the 
draft proposal making it more difficult for the elderly disabled 
and poor to appeal government decisions to deny welfare or social 
security benefits 
there they go again said rep claude pepper dfla 88 the 
oldest member of the house and its foremost champion of the elderly 
he challenged presidentelect george bush to kill the plan and said 
if it goes forward congress will stop this thing in its tracks 
the draft rules on social security appeals were designed to 
reduce a staggering load of appeals hearings last year the agency 
received 55 million claims and 250000 requests for appeals 
hearings 
chuck kline a spokesman for health and human services secretary 
otis bowen said the social security and medicare appeals processes 
must become more efficient the solution they are suggesting in 
the social security administration may not be workable or doable 
and until its reviewed you dont know that he said 
but critics were quick to attack the draft proposals several 
charged they would violate the spirit of the 1935 social security 
act as well as a 1971 supreme court ruling supporting an informal 
and liberal appeals process easily accessible to the elderly poor 
and disabled who often do not have lawyers 
horace deets executive director of the american association of 
retired persons called the proposals misguided and unjustified 
ken hoagland a spokesman for the private national committee to 
preserve social security and medicare accused the administration of 
trying to stack the deck against disability appeal claimants

brazilians expressed frustration 
with president jose sarneys centerright government economic chaos 
and corruption by giving massive support to leftists in muncipal 
elections around the nation 
at least now the voters cant blame us for everything that goes 
wrong with brazil said gov pedro simon of rio grande do sul 
state a member of sarneys brazilian democratic movement party 
early returns from tuesdays balloting showed that the dominant 
party since 1964 was taking a beating from both the right and the 
left but that leftists were surging ahead for control of major 
cities 
final results were not expected until sunday 
analysts said voters were dissatisfied with a record 1000 
percent annual inflation rate the falling value of the cruzado 
political corruption and nearly constant strikes 
the voters didnt send us just a message a message is short 
this was a telex said gov wellington moreira franco of rio de 
janeiro state a member of sarneys party 
in the biggest upset luiza erundina a 53yearold social worker 
and a marxist from the workers party was expected to win as mayor 
of sao paulo the countrys largest city 
with 15 percent of the citys more than 5 million votes counted 
ms erundina led paulo maluf a wealthy industrialist and former 
militarybacked presidential candidate by 4 percent 
ms erundina told reporters she would concentrate municipal 
funding on public health transportation and abandoned children 
areas in which hardly anything ever was invested before 
in rio the no 2 city the winner was marcello alencar a 
63yearold lawyer from the leftist democratic labor party he is a 
close ally of leonel brizola the expected candidate of the left in 
next years presidential elections 
with 28 percent of the ballots counted alencar had onethird 
more votes than his closest opponent 
the projected winner in belo horizonte the thirdlargest city 
was joao pimenta da veiga filho 41 of the leftcenter brazilian 
social democracy party this group recently broke away from sarneys 
party 
the democratic movement which swept mayoral elections in 1985 
and captured 22 of 23 state governorships in 1986 appeared headed 
for mayoralty wins in just four capitals 
leftists seemed assured of victory in at least seven important 
state capitals candidates from various groups to the right of 
sarneys were headed toward wins in seven other capitals 
the biggest prize for the rightists was the large northeastern 
city of recife where joaquim francisco cavalcanti 40 of the 
liberal front party was far ahead he resigned this year from 
sarneys cabinet 
races in the remaining capitals were too close to call or the 
results were not yet in because of the cities remoteness 
the democratic movement and sarney have controlled brazilian 
politics since the nation of 144 million returned in 1985 to 
civilian rule after a 21year military dictatorship 
brazil is in the throes of its worst strike by petroleum workers 
the stateowned oil monopoly petrobras said wednesday that brazil 
has nearly run out of diesel oil and cooking gas because of the 
sixday nationwide strike 
twentynine parties participated in the election for mayors and 
city councils of more than 4000 cities and towns 
the races were based largely on local issues but analysts said 
they indicate general feelings about presidential elections 
scheduled for nov 15 1989 it will be the first presidential 
election in brazil in 29 years 
the 58yearold sarney is a civilian but he gained office 
indirectly through an electoral college system imposed by the 
departing military regime he was the vice presidential candidate on 
a ticket headed by tancredo neves a popular centrist political 
figure neves died before he could assume office and sarney moved 
into the top spot

problems among foreign coal producers and the 
lower dollar abroad contributed to a 247 percent increase in the 
amount of us coal shipped through the st lawrence seaway 
officials say 
the increase to 569000 metric tons was recorded during the 
period from april to october as compared to the same period last 
year 
spurring the demand for americanmined coal were the lower value 
of the dollar competitive worldwide ocean freight rates a tight 
supply due to a series of industrial disputes last summer in 
australia sanctions against using south african coal and 
production problems and rising production costs in poland 
us coal exports through the seaway in apriloctober of 1987 
totaled 234000 metric tons in 1985 and 1986 the biggest coal 
years since 1982 coal exports just exceeded 600000 tons each year

thirtynine that magic age teetering between 
youth and maturity will be the most typical age for americans early 
in the next century according to census bureau projections 
historically a nation of youthful orientation the united states 
is now thirtysomething heading upward the bureau reports 
combining to increase the median age of the population are the 
maturing of the massive post world war ii baby boom and that 
generations relatively low birth rates which reduce the number of 
babies to pull down the numbers 
so if present trends continue census officials expect that half 
of all americans will be over the age of 39 by the year 2010 and 
half younger the agencys most recent estimate of median age was 
317 as of 1986 
whether america will plateau at 39 as did the late comedian 
jack benny remains to be seen 
the median age of the country touched 30 for the first time in 
1950 then slipped back as the baby boom produced a bouncing crop of 
youngsters to lower the numbers 
it took until the 1980 census to hit 30 again edged up to 317 
as of 1986 and is expected to climb to 33 by 1990 365 by 2000 and 
39 by the year 2010 according to the new projections from the 
census bureau 
despite the aging of the population however the report 
anticipates that the socalled dependency ratio will decline 
that ratio is the number of people under 18 and over 65 compared 
to the number of people of working age in between the younger and 
older groups are most likely to depend on those working 
the 1986 ratio of 622 dependents per 100 workers is expected to 
slip to 567 by the year 2010 with the low birth rate reducing the 
number of young dependents to a greater extent than aging adds to 
the older group 
while there have been reports of increases in the total number of 
births in the last few years that is because the giant baby boom 
generation is largely in its prime childbearing years the rate of 
births per 1000 remains well below that of the postworld war ii 
period 
the new census study also estimates that the nations black 
population will increase to 137 percent by 2010 blacks made up 
118 percent of the population in the 1980 census 
nearly one in five southerners will be black in 2010 197 
percent of the population that will be up from 187 percent in 1980 
in the northeast blacks will increase from 101 percent to 132 
percent they will go from 91 percent to 119 percent in the 
midwest and from 53 percent to 63 percent in the west 
the projections show the northeast remaining the oldest section 
of the country with the median age for that region increasing from 
336 in 1986 to 403 in 2010 
the south will be second in 2010 at a median age of 384 up from 
314 in 1986 the midwest will mature from 316 to 388 and the west 
will go from 310 to 374 
florida will remain the state with the highest median age and 
utah will still be the youngest state according to the projections 
florida with a median age of 360 in 1986 will age to 453 
utahs median will rise from 255 to 276 leaving it the only state 
with a median age below 30 years thanks largely to a continuing 
high birth rate 
in the 1986 estimates no state had a median over 40 but several 
were under 30 including besides utah alaska idaho louisiana 
mississippi new mexico texas and wyoming 
in 2010 not only florida will have topped 40 other states with 
median ages above that milestone will include arkansas connecticut 
iowa maine nevada new jersey oregon pennsylvania rhode island 
tennessee washington and west virginia

a conservative group contends that 
presidentelect george bush should make covert action a routine 
technique in the american spy arsenal 
a study sponsored by the national strategic information center 
says covert action unacknowledged financial political or military 
action to influence events in foreign countries should be restored 
as a common tool of us foreign policy 
american intelligence as it is presently constituted will not 
be up to the challenges of the 90s said roy godson of georgetown 
university who edited the study the report was released wednesday 
at a news conference 
the report says covert action tactics have been tainted in the

the cia as stepchildren the study concluded 
it also said us intelligence analysts should do more to spot 
the vulnerabilities of foreign governments and leaders and point out

a parade of witnesses before a 
deficitreduction commission agreed the nation is spending too much 
and saving too little but panel members said they were far from 
reaching a consensus on how to resolve the problem 
the national economic commission members listened to almost eight 
hours of testimony wednesday from a variety of experts many of whom 
warned of dire consequences for the united states if quick action is 
not taken to cut the federal budget deficit 
simply put we are spending too much investing too little and 
saving virtually nothing said former labor secretary william 
brock this country is imperiled and it is going to take a whole 
lot of guts to face this fact and deal with it 
later commission members said they were still watching for the 
first signal from presidentelect george bush on what his intentions 
are for using the panel which was created to advise president 
reagans successor on a deficit solution 
both republican drew lewis and democrat robert strauss who serve 
as cochairmen of the panel said they hoped the presidentelect 
would soon name his two appointees to the commission so the panel 
could begin serious deliberations 
the commission already has set aside its earlier hopes of having 
a deficitcutting blueprint finished by dec 21 strauss said he was 
not sure the panel would be able to meet a march 1 deadline and 
might have to delay the report even further 
the key to the commissions role is going to be up to the 
presidentelect said rep bill gray dpa a member of the panel 
and chairman of the house budget committee who does he appoint 
how credible are they do they have his ear and what are his 
instructions to them 
gray said the financial markets might force bushs hand 
especially if markets continue falling because of investor concerns 
over whether the presidentelect and congress will be able to come 
up with a credible budget solution 
the stock market on wednesday tumbled to a 2month low in a 
broadbased decline that analysts said was linked to fresh declines 
in the value of the dollar the dollars recent slide has led stock 
market investors to worry that us policymakers might force up 
interest rates threatening a further slowdown in the economy to 
make the american currency more attractive to foreigners 
economists testifying before the national economic commission 
said the 700 billion in new foreign investment which has flowed 
into the country since 1982 means that the us economy is more 
vulnerable to foreigners economic decisions 
the rest of the world may well give up on the dollar if it 
foresees four more years of towering twin budget and trade 
deficits said c fred bergsten head of the institute for 
international economics 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan told the panel that it 
should not listen to those who say that bduget deficits dont matter 
since the economy has managed to survive for six years without an 
economic downturn in the midst of high deficits 
the deficit already has begun to eat away at the foundations of 
our economic strength he said and the need to deal with it is 
becoming ever more urgent 
alice rivlin former head of the congressional budget office 
told the commission that it was facing no easy choices 
the budget cannot be cut in sufficient amounts to eliminate the 
deficit except by reducing programs and benefits that some people 
feel they want and need or by raising revenues she said it 
is not possible to eliminate the deficit if defense social security 
and taxes are all ruled out simultaneously 
comments of this kind were not often heard during the 
presidential campaign when both candidates sidestepped questions 
concerning the deficit because they did not want to offer detailed 
solutions 
but since winning the election bush has been forced to address 
the budget situation pledging to work with congress early on to 
come up with a solution 
but bush has not indicated any willingness to abandon his 
flexible freeze proposal by which overall spending increases 
excluding social security and interest on the national debt would 
be held to the rise of inflation each year

items seized in the fbis computer virus 
investigation include magnetic tapes from the computer account of a 
cornell university graduate student implicated in the contamination 
of 6000 computers nationwide 
documents released late wednesday by the fbi said the magnetic 
tapes were from the account of robert t morris jr 23 a cornell 
graduate student in computer science who has told friends he created 
the virus program 
the program spread earlier this month throughout a number of 
university and military computer networks disrupting their 
operation morris has said that he did not intend for it to invade 
computer systems around the nation 
according to the documents released wednesday us district 
judge gustave j dibianco in the northern district of new york in 
syracuse issued two warrants on nov 10 for the cornell searches 
the searches were conducted that same afternoon the documents 
indicate 
the government had said earlier that it might try to obtain 
documents from the university before interviewing morris and 
cornells vice president for information technologies m stuart 
lynn had said the university would cooperate fully with the 
investigation 
no charges have been filed in the case 
according to the fbi documents investigators seized two 
magnetic tapes labeled files from morris account including backups 
and hard copy related thereto from dean krafft a research 
associate in computer science at cornell 
federal agents also obtained two yellow legal pads with 
calculus and assorted notes an associate university counsel 
thomas santoro had taken the legal pads from an office in upson 
hall a campus building that contains computer science classrooms 
and offices 
the fbi is conducting a criminal investigation to determine 
whether statutes concerning wire fraud malicious mischief or 
unlawful access to stored communications may have been broken with 
the introduction of the virus into military and university computer 
systems 
a computer virus works by duplicating itself spreading into 
other programs in the computer and infecting one computer after 
another as users share floppy disks or link up over telephone lines 
mild viruses may do nothing more than flash a provocative message 
on a users screen deadly forms can destroy data or cripple a 
computer some are time bombs designed to wreak havoc on a 
preprogrammed date 
the virus that infected 6000 university and military computers 
nationwide this month apparently did its damage by rapidly 
duplicating itself thereby slowing computers processing speed and 
taking up their memory space

the justice department says it found no 
evidence whatsoever to support an allegation that a former 
assistant attorney general had smoked marijuana 
the us attorney in boston frank mcnamara had told 
investigators he had witnessed his predecessor william weld 
smoking marijuana at a 1982 party in virginia 
a 17page document filed wednesday in federal appeals court by 
attorney general dick thornburgh said that whatever picture 
mcnamara has in his mind of three people including weld and his 
wife smoking marijuana together the overwhelming evidence is 
that it was not the case 
an internal memo released at the justice department on which 
thornburghs court filing was based said mcnamara told the fbi that 
he himself had used marijuana as recently as four years ago though 
not while us attorney in boston the internal memo written by 
criminal division chief edward dennis also outlines what it says 
was apparent conflict between weld and some other justice department 
officials 
the memo concluded there is a serious doubt as to whether 
weld and his wife even attended the 1982 party it said there is 
no evidence whatsoever to support mcnamaras story that he saw 
weld his wife and another man smoking a joint together 
neither of the welds even recalls attending the party and neither 
do a number of other people who know the welds well said the memo 
the memo provides the basis on which thornburgh decided not to 
call on a threemember federal appeals court panel to appoint an 
independent counsel to investigate weld for possibly making a false 
statement during a 1987 probe by the departments office of 
professional responsibility in which he denied smoking marijuana 
the court directed that thornburghs court filing be publicly 
released 
the memo said james byrnes a deputy assistant attorney general 
in the justice department told investigators he had been asked to 
call mcnamara to dig up some dirt on weld he said the request 
was made by thendeputy attorney general arnold burns 
mcnamara then reported to byrnes that he had witnessed weld 
smoking marijuana at the 1982 party 
at the time mcnamara was under consideration to succeed weld in 
the boston post the memo said mcnamara believed weld was trying to 
scuttle his nomination but that he bore no ill will toward weld 
because holding a grudge was against his religion 
in an interview wednesday night burns denied telling byrnes to 
dig up dirt on weld he called byrness comments complete and 
total fabrication and said they bear no semblance with reality 
burns called his relations with weld excellent

environmentalists public officials and 
scientists are urging states to take the initiative to reduce their 
emissions of carbon gases from fossil fuel use not wait for 
international action on the global warming trend 
it can be done on a statebystate basis the individual 
counts says george woodwell of the woods hole research center in 
massachusetts there are steps that should be taken by good 
government pursuing the public interest 
texas agriculture commissioner jim hightower says warnings by 
scientists about the socalled greenhouse effect requires state 
leadership to think globally and act locally turning the corner on 
greenhouse gases is too big to leave to the federal government 
they and tina hobson executive director of renew america cited 
a variety of steps for cutting the use of oil coal and natural gas 
the main sources of the carbon gases that experts say are 
contributing to global warming 
among the statelevel actions they recommended at a news 
conference wednesday are encouraging greater use of mass 
transportation planting trees to absorb carbon and using tax 
incentives and building codes to spur more efficient energy 
consumption 
hobson unveiled a study by renew america an environmental 
research and advocacy organization showing that hightowers state 
of texas was the clearcut leader among us states in carbon gas 
production in 1986 
its 15487 million metric tons amounted to about 12 percent of 
the 1275 billion metric tons of carbons pumped into the atmosphere 
that year by the united states the worlds largest producer of 
carbons and other greenhouse gases 
renew america said this country is responsible for about 25 
percent of the worlds carbon emissions coal and natural gas 
meaning texas is the source of about 3 percent of global carbon 
loadings to the atmosphere 
carbons represent about half of the greenhouse gases that many 
scientists say are accumulating in the atmosphere trapping the 
suns heat and threatening the planet with rising ocean levels and 
major climate changes 
in what was billed as the first statebystate breakdown of 
carbon emissions renew america said that largely rural vermont was 
the nations lowest contributor to carbon emissions with 131 
million metric tons in 1986 
renew america said it compiled its figures from fueluse data 
collected by the department of energy and had its report reviewed by 
officials from the environmental protection agency and 
privatesector researchers including woodwell 
the overall findings were not startling they showed a general 
correlation between a states population and industrial activity and 
its production of carbon gases 
texas with a large concentration of oil refineries and chemical 
plants was no 1 in carbon emissions from oil and natural gas the 
cleanest burning fossil fuel and no 3 in emissions from coal 
california was second overall in 1986 producing 8523 million 
metric tons of carbons three out of every four tons came from use 
of oil reflecting the states huge number of vehicles 
other heavy producers of carbon emissions were ohio 6721 
million metric tons pennsylvania 6557 illinois 5504 
louisiana 5173 new york 4957 indiana 4913 michigan 4712 
and florida 4355 
renew america also calculated how many tons of carbon a state 
released in relation to its economy west virginia a depressed area 
dominated by coal use and chemical plants had the worst showing 
1179 tons for each 1 million in gross state product 
texas indiana and louisiana were the only states among the top 
10 carbon producers and the bottom 10 in the ratio of tonnage to 
gross state product 
new york had the best economicratio showing producing 137 tons 
for every 1 million of gross state product californias tonnage 
was 160 per 1 million compared to a national average of 306 tons 
for each 1 million

irancontra prosecutors say oliver l north 
wants to scare the justice department into dropping charges against 
him by seeking disclosure of some of our nations most valuable 
secrets 
independent counsel lawrence e walsh is seeking a court order to 
bar north from revealing any classified information during his 
defense of charges he illegally conspired to divert usiran 
armssale proceeds to the nicaraguan contra rebels 
north showed his intention of trying to subvert the case by not 
presenting a goodfaith listing of the classified documents that he 
reasonably deems necessary to defend against the indictment walsh 
said in court papers filed wednesday 
the list of 40000 pages of secret documents north proposed as 
defense exhibits includes items that are simple efforts at 
graymail and have no conceivable bearing on the charges in the 
indictment walsh said 
it includes documents which are far afield from any logical 
defense including large swatches of cia cables concerning 
nicaragua that bear only the most tangential relation to the subject 
matter in the case walsh said of the defense list filed under 
court seal 
the independent counsel asked us district judge gerhard a 
gesell to issue an order under the classified information procedures 
act cipa barring north from disclosing any government secrets 
during his trial 
otherwise north will have exposed this prosecution to 
precisely the type of outcome that the drafters of cipa worked to 
avoid a decision by the attorney general based purely on fear 
that the price in terms of threat to national security is too high 
that compels the court not to proceed with the criminal case 
walsh said 
norths filing demonstrates once against his expectation that 
intransigence will encumber the processes of law threaten some of 
our nations most valuable secrets and provoke dismissal of the 
case walsh said 
the attorney general not walsh has the final say about 
whether to drop the charges if disclosure of secrets would threaten 
national security 
the socalled graymail statute enacted in 1980 by congress 
set up procedures to regulate the use of classified information in 
court proceedings 
walsh argued the law is a critical timetested shield of the 
governments necessary secrets and at the same time a device that 
prevents high officeholders from escaping criminal prosecution by 
threatening indiscriminate disclosure of secrets 
but north from the outset of this litigation has been 
determined to force a failure of cipas procedures walsh said 
the present notice is so grossly overblown that it invites 
dismissal for lack of good faith 
under cipa the defense is required to submit a notice listing 
the classified documents it proposes to disclose at trial the judge 
then convenes secret proceedings to determine if the documents are 
relevant to the case and if they can be presented in public form 
walsh described the notice as calculated to overwhelm the 
courts and the governments abilities to conduct proceedings 
under the law 
gesell rejected norths first list filed aug 1 as wholly 
insufficient later saying it blatantly lacked any attempt at 
particularization 
the judge denied a similar request by walsh to bar defense 
disclosure of any secrets and gave north until nov 14 to file his 
notice 
on wednesday walsh said the defense should be barred from using 
any classified documents because north arrogantly disregarded the 
courts repeated orders defining his obligations under cipa 
norths attorneys who have a policy of not commenting on the 
case did not return a reporters telephone call 
but in court papers made public wednesday the defense rejected 
gesells criticism of their aug 1 filings as unjustified the 
lawyers disputed gesells holding that they were required to show 
how the documents were relevant to the case 
north a former national security council aide and retired marine 
lieutenant colonel is charged with conspiring to defraud the 
government by illegally diverting to the contras more than 12 
million in profits from the armsforhostage sales to iran 
no date has been set for norths trial 
his three codefendants former national security adviser john m 
poindexter and arms dealers albert hakim and retired air force maj 
gen richard v secord each have been granted separate trials

an unprecedented joint appearance by two men 
frequently described as the respective fathers of the soviet and 
american hydrogen bombs featured sharp disagreement on whether 
spacebased defenses would bring world harmony or nuclear war 
andrei sakharov the soviet scientist who has become his nations 
foremost human rights activist said deploying such a defense system 
would destabilize the world and could trigger nuclear war 
between the superpowers 
edward teller one of the principal american advocates of 
deploying the star wars defense system said it could lead to a 
world neighborhood of cooperation and peace 
the two scientists aired their views wednesday evening at a 
banquet honoring teller as a pioneer in the field of nuclear physics 
and for his advocacy of the strategic defense initiative sdi it 
was sponsored by the ethics and public policy center a conservative 
research group 
sakharov 67 winner of the nobel and albert einstein peace 
prizes attended the dinner as part of his first trip outside his 
native land he and teller held a private 20minute conversation 
the first time the two had met 
in a speech at the beginning of the banquet sakharov praised 
teller as a man of principle and conviction but said deploying the 
strategic defense initiative as the star wars plan is formally 
known would be a great error 
i feel it would destabilize the world sakharov said 
he cited the enormous cost involved in paying for the 
deployment of a defense system by the united states and for the 
soviet union to field new offensive weapons to defeat it 
if such systems are deployed there would be a temptation to 
destroy them before they were armed sakharov said and this in 
itself could trigger a nuclear war 
short of actual war sakharov said sdi is an obstacle to better 
relations between the two superpowers 
sdi is one of the problems that stands in the way of achieving 
really deep and profound arms control he said 
soviet objections to sdi have been a central obstacle to 
superpower negotiations in geneva on cutting longrange nuclear arms 
by up to 50 percent 
teller responding at the banquets end and after sakharov had 
departed called sakharov a great man who shares with the world 
a desire for peace 
andrei sakharov argued for the rights of individuals argued 
for freedom in an incredibly courageous manner and he won teller 
said of sakharovs long human rights battle against the soviet 
system 
but he said that as a physicist sakharov is out of touch with 
the technological advances of recent decades including advances in 
the soviet union which teller said is closer to deploying a 
spacebased defense system than is the united states 
my argument has been that we must know what can be known we 
must find out whether a defense system will work he said 
including lasers that move with the speed of light 
i have enjoyed the possibility to work on all these things 
he said andrei sakharov has not 
technology has made out of the world a small neighborhood he 
said self defense is of interest to everybody 
both men noted that their early careers in nuclear physics had 
followed parallel paths 
sakharov said that at the time he was working on the soviet 
hydrogen bomb he and his colleagues believed that it was necessary 
for the peace of the world to do such terrible things 
the world has now entered a new era and i am convinced a new 
approach is necessary he said 
while he and teller disagree sakharov said that through such 
dialogues their countries will at least understand each others 
point of view and be able to talk instead of creating a situation of 
confrontation

americans face the highest risk of weight gain 
during their 20s and 30s when they put on an average of seven 
pounds a decade a study shows 
however by age 55 people tend to stop putting on weight and 
begin losing it 
researchers said their study based on a nationwide survey of 
almost 10000 adults is the first to calculate the risk of getting 
fat 
younger adults are at greatest risk of gaining substantial 
amounts of weight during adulthood said dr david f williamson 
a greater effort has to be applied to preventing obesity early in 
adulthood possibly before age 25 
the study found that men and women between ages 25 and 34 are 
likely to gain an average of seven pounds over the next 10 years 
however about 6 percent of the people in this age group will gain 
nearly 30 pounds in the next decade 
the tendency to gain weight does not affect the sexes equally an 
average american man puts on an extra six pounds between his 25th 
and 35th birthdays but a woman gains almost eight pounds 
the figures analyzed by experts at the us centers for disease 
control were released wednesday at the annual meeting of the 
american heart association 
among other findings 
on average people under age 55 tend to gain weight over time 
while those over 55 tend to lose it 
up to the age of 55 women gain more weight then men while 
after 55 women lost more 
at all ages women are twice as likely as men to have very large 
weight gains 
among people who were not overweight when the study began those 
aged 35 to 44 had the greatest risk of becoming overweight while 
those 65 and above had the lowest risk 
williamson said it is not clear from the results whether 
americans risk of gaining weight is actually increasing 
as a nation we are still too fat he said but i dont 
know if we are getting fatter or leaner 
the study was based on an initial survey of 14407 us adults 
between 1971 and 1975 researchers contacted 9897 of these people a 
decade later and weighed them again 
too much weight is clearly a health hazard other research shows 
that men may double their risk of heart disease if they are 30 
percent above the weights recommended in the 1959 metropolitan life 
insurance weight tables this much excess weight for women increases 
risk by 22 percent 
williamson said weight gain is often so gradual that people fail 
to realize whats happening until they are already significantly 
overweight 
he like many diet experts recommends keeping weight off rather 
than trying to lose it once the extra pounds have been gained 
walking 45 minutes a day as well as reducing the amount of fat 
in the diet are effective ways of keeping weight under control 
he said

here at a glance are the main developments in 
presidentelect george bushs preparations for taking over as chief 
executive 
a team of 13 people mostly campaign workers with experience in 
the reagan adminstration has been assembled to direct bushs 
transition office the task at hand is to chose people for about 
5000 political jobs open in 1989 as well as developing policies for 
bush the team is codirected by craig fuller and robert teeter who 
were appointed by bush the day after his election nov 8 
teeter said the presidentelect would review candidates today 
for two or three cabinet positions he did not say which ones and 
would not discuss any names 
bush meets british prime minister margaret thatcher today over 
breakfast the two held private talks on wednesday and bush also 
met with soviet dissident andrei sakharov 
the presidentelect said no final decision had been made on 
chosing a white house chief of staff but sources close to bush said 
he had picked retiring new hampshire gov john sununu at a news 
conference in concord sununu said he had discussed the job with 
bush but would not confirm his selection 
the new york office of the antidefamation league of bnai 
brith said it was concerned about sununu getting the white house 
job because he was the only governor who refused to endorse a 
proclamation attacking a 1975 un resolution that equated zionism 
with racism 
sununu who is arabamerican told reporters he did not endorse 
the proclamation because it would have been inappropriate for a 
governor to try to issue something that would have as its focus an 
attempt to influence foreign policy 
all of the staff and volunteers involved in bushs takeover of 
power were asked to sign a standards of conduct document that 
applies both during the transition and a bush presidency at the top 
of the list was a noleak promise it also forbids aides from using 
information for private gain and says they must disqualify 
themselves from any matter which may involve a financial conflict of 
interest

soviet drivers are so reckless and roads are so bad 
that the annual soviet traffic death toll is almost as high as in 
the united states which has 10 times as many cars the communist 
party daily said 
about 40000 people are killed in traffic accidents each year in 
the soviet union pravda said wednesday 
there is a lack of elementary ethics on the road with drivers 
behaving rudely and without any respect towards each other the 
paper the soviet road and high speed are not compatible 
the 1986 traffic death toll in the united states was 47900 
according to the 1988 world almanac 
pravda said in an article oct 30 that the soviet union has about 
50 cars per 1000 people compared to 560 per 1000 in the united 
states 
pedestrians account for about 13000 of the annual soviet traffic 
deaths more than the combined total of the united states britain 
france and west germany the paper said 
it said 13 out of every 100 people injured in soviet car 
accidents die compared to 13 percent in the united states 
driving can be notoriously challenging in moscow whose main 
roads are clogged with trucks that spew clouds of black smoke and 
often break down in the middle of the streets 
foreign visitors complain that muscovites pay no attention to 
normal traffic guidelines such as painted lane lines 
you can expect to have your car kissed said one british 
driver he said soviet drivers seem to consider it a point of honor 
to nearly sideswipe automobiles they pass 
soviet drivers rarely use the turn signal and seem to regard it 
as a tipoff to other drivers who may try to foil their maneuver 
pravda said rudeness was the motivation for drivers overtaking 
slower moving cars or simply refusing to give up the particular lane 
their cars occupy 
traffic police who stand at intersections and in the middle of 
major streets rain or shine are disrespectful to drivers and dont 
help matters pravda said 
drivers cannot get a license without a sixmonth course but once 
they receive it its theirs for life unless it is revoked for 
repeated traffic regulation violations there is no program for 
license renewal or periodic testing 
roads also are under severe climatic stress from severe cold in 
winter to relative warm in winter 
the temperature extremes combined with the weight of thousands 
of military and government trucks that rumble over the roads daily 
often cause huge potholes 
urgent measures including a special national program should 
be taken to combat accidents on soviet roads pravda said 
its time that programs for teaching driving should be changed 
and instead of studying parts of the car and spending considerable 
time on it it could be more useful if the actual driving and 
traffic rules are studied more thoroughly it said

pakistans first open national assembly elections in more than a 
decade 
with 165 of 205 districts reporting ms bhuttos pakistan 
peoples party had 76 seats in the national assembly its main 
rival the rightwing islamic democratic alliance had 39 and the 
remaining 46 went to independent and minor parties 
the nineparty islamic democratic alliance includes loyalists of 
president mohammed zia ulhaq the military president who died in a 
plane crash three months ago 
if her party wins a majority in the assembly ms bhutto would 
likely be named prime minister becoming the first woman to lead 
this islamic nation without a majority the party will be forced to 
forge a governing coalition 
the victory the ppp achieved is because of the selfless 
sacrifices the struggle by people of the ppp ms bhutto told the 
news conference after a rally of about 8000 people on the lawn of 
her family home in the southern city of larkana 
the crowd chanted long live benazir and benazir prime 
minister 
former prime minister mohammad khan junejo one of bhuttos main 
rivals from the islamic alliance conceded defeat late wednesday in 
his bid for an assembly seat 
were on the losing side he said of his defeat by a pakistan 
peoples party candidate in his hometown of sindhri he said the 
bhutto party had succeeded very well nationally 
the chairman of the alliance ghulam mustafa jatoi lost in both 
districts he contested to pakistan peoples party candidates 
under pakistani rules candidates may contest more than one seat 
to improve their chance of election but must forfeit all but one 
the vacant seats are contested later in byelections 
the other main rival of ms bhutto chief minister nawaz sharif 
of punjab state claimed victory in the race for an assembly seat in 
lahore his hometown but lost to a pakistan peoples party member

and hanged in 1979 
about 48 million of pakistans 107 million people were eligible 
to vote and unofficial estimates said slightly more than half voted 
illiterate millions chose their candidates by symbol an arrow for 
the bhutto party a bicycle for the islamic democratic alliance and 
other symbols such as a ladder flower or ink pot for nearly 30 
smaller parties 
men and women voted separately in keeping with strict moslem 
practice 
at stake were 205 of the 207 moslem seats and 10 for nonmoslems 
in the 237member national assembly the remaining 20 seats are 
reserved for women and will be filled later by vote of the assembly 
voting for two moslem seats was postponed because of the death of 
an elderly candidate in each district 
on saturday pakistanis vote to fill the 483 seats in pakistans 
four provincial assemblies 
both major parties have said they would maintain the 
longstanding friendship with the united states and continue support 
for moslem guerrillas fighting the communist government in 
neighboring afghanistan 
of more than 5 million afghans who have fled during 10 years of 
civil war at least 3 million live in pakistani border cities and 
refugee camps that serve as bases and supply points for the 
insurgents 
police and soldiers in armored vehicles patrolled several cities

violence

person who will form the next government presumably the leader of 
the strongest party in the national assembly 
ghulam ishaq khan the interim president will have no deadline 
for the choice but the constitution the new assembly must convene 
within 30 days and a new government must pass a confidence vote 
within 60 days after that 
asked late wednesday whether he would be reluctant to designate a 
woman as head of government ishaq khan replied i think a woman 
prime minister might be a good change 
both the pakistan peoples party which zulfikar ali bhutto 
founded and the alliance have pledged to continue zias policy of 
increasing the influence of islam in the nations life 
ms bhutto has said however that she would not allow the 
religious policy to work against the rights of women or minorities 
zia ruled for eight years under martial law after the coup then 
held national elections in 1985 in which political parties were not 
allowed to compete major opposition groups boycotted the elections 
including ms bhutto and her supporters 
in may zia dismissed junejos government and dissolved the 
national assembly alleging corruption incompetence and delay in 
applying islamic law 
he called this election before the aug 17 plane crash that 
killed him the us ambassador and 28 other people

the reagan administrations refusal to protect 
us auto parts makers from unfair and illegal canadian trading 
policies will skew that economic sector to canadas benefit 
michigan gov james blanchard says 
us trade representative clayton yeutter on wednesday rejected 
the michigan governors petition to declare a canadian dutyrebate 
program to be an unfair trading practice 
blanchard said that decision will allow illegal practices to 
fully develop distorting employment trade and investment to the 
benefit of canada 
canada gives duty rebates on autos to foreign manufacturers in 
return for the use of canadian parts in their cars which yeutter 
said is permitted in a massive freetrade agreement between canada 
and the us that has already been approved by the congress

the nations most elaborate and exclusive entertainment the reagans

and so it was wednesday evening when pianist michael feinstein

love is here to stay to ill be seeing you a tune played at 
the first state dinner honoring mrs thatcher on feb 26 1981 a

with anecdotes both at the dinner table and among the 
demitassesipping guests in the blue room

parting gift to the reagans was a leather photograph album 
containing nine black and white photographs from the presidents 
1949 movie the hasty heart which he filmed in britain 
in the toasts superlatives were the order of the night 
she is a leader with the vision and the courage to stay the 
course until the battles are won reagan said of his guest even 
though his voice was raspy the president pressed on to say the 
impact of mrs thatchers leadership at home and abroad secures her 
place in history 
as i prepare to depart this office in january i take 
considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that margaret thatcher 
will still reside at no 10 downing street 
the prime minister praised reagan as more than a staunch ally 
and counselor you have also been a wonderful friend to me and our 
country 
mrs thatcher saluted as well the first lady whose charm 
dignity and quiet but sure courage have won the hearts of millions 
she also said she wanted to warmly congratulate vice 
president bush and his wife barbara on his recent election adding 
that she looked forward to working with you as a true and trusted 
friend

she appeared to be a grandmotherly 
landlady who took in the homeless but court records show the woman 
arrested in the deaths of seven tenants was a dangerous eccentric 
who preyed on the ill and elderly for years 
the records indicate that 59yearold dorothea montalvo puente 
who was arrested late wednesday in downtown los angeles after a 
fiveday search could be kind and generous one moment and cunning 
and cruel the next 
puente had not been seen since saturday when police allowed her 
to walk away from her victorian rooming house after the first of 
seven bodies was unearthed in the yard 
her estranged daughter linda bloom of south pasadena described 
her as shy withdrawn and reserved with no real personality 
doctors discovered she may have a penchant for poisoning as far back 
as 1980 according to a probation report 
police believe puente killed tenants to collect their social 
security benefits they have a list of two dozen people who are 
missing and who might have lived at puentes eightbedroom house at 
one time or another 
one former tenant homer myers told reporters wednesday that he 
and other tenants unknowingly helped puente dispose of the bodies by 
digging the makeshift graves 
myers 74 said puente first asked him to dig a hole in the back 
yard for an apricot tree 
she said she had contacted a nursery and they told her she 
needed a hole that was 4 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet deep i thought 
that was a little deep now i know why 
court documents including a record of her first conviction for 
forging checks in 1948 paint the picture of a conniving 
manipulative woman who can concoct a story for any occasion 
puente herself in letters to a judge preparing to sentence her 
on unrelated charges in 1982 described her life as plagued with 
hardship four failed marriages abuse and the responsibility of 
supporting some of her numerous brothers and sisters 
in the court documents most of which were filed in connection 
with search or arrest warrants puente claimed to be of mexican 
descent the youngest of 18 children however san bernardino county 
recorded her birth as dorothea helen gray on jan 19 1929 in 
redlands to jessie gray an exserviceman and trudy yates a 
housewife 
the first complaints that puente may have been involved in 
poisoning came in early 1980 when doctors at university medical 
center in sacramento conducted a toxicology test on an emergency 
room patient 79yearold esther busby 
busbys physician dr jerome lackner recalled that he first 
suspected puente his patients livein companion of poisoning 
busby with overdoses of a heart medication he had prescribed 
lackner notified officials of the county adult protective 
services agency that puente was poisoning or making busby sick by 
overmedicating her and that i suspected that she was ripping mrs 
busby off 
they were able to check and found out that mrs busbys 
social security check had been cashed and that the endorsement was 
a forgery he said i told esther what was going on and she got

sacramento hospitals about puente a criminal investigation by 
county authorities and puentes 1982 arrest on charges of forgery 
grand theft and administering stupefying drugs

puente told the judge in one of the letters that she remarried 
after her first husband died that marriage ended in divorce after 
18 years and she later married a mr montalvo who she claimed

benazir bhutto of pakistan is following 
the traditional route to power by women politicians in the asian 
subcontinent 
she capitalized on family ties and played on the emotions of 
crowds who remembered her executed father prime minister zulfikar 
ali bhutto 
but an iron will behind the tears served her well in her foray 
into the maledominated political arena in a region where most women 
have yet to achieve economic educational and professional parity 
like the daughters and widows of fallen leaders in india 
bangladesh and sri lanka she is a savvy charismatic intelligent 
student of politics who graduated into leadership ranks in her own 
right 
the most famous and the one who left the deepest mark on her 
own nation and on the world was indira gandhi of india 
mrs gandhi was considered a pliable young lady and the ideal 
compromise candidate when the squabbling cronies of her late father 
prime minister jawaharlal nehru had to anoint a new leader of 
indias dominant congress party 
she proved to be anything but pliable 
mrs gandhi governed india as prime minister from 1966 to 1977 
turning a country where bullock carts and bicycles are major means 
of transportation into a nuclear power and a mighty military force 
her increasingly authoritarian measures handed her a crushing 
election defeat after her first 11 years in power but she bounced 
back into office in 1980 with a resounding comeback victory 
she governed another four years until she was assassinated by her 
sikh bodyguards in revenge for the army raid she had ordered to 
flush out gunmen holed up the sikh faiths holiest shrine the 
golden temple in amritsar 
the first woman political leader in the asian subcontinent was 
sirimavo bandaranaike of sri lanka her husband prime minister 
swrd bandaranaike was assassinated by a buddhist monk in 1959 
the following year with his sri lanka freedom party in a 
shambles the male politicians turned to his widow as the person 
most capable of restoring unity 
mrs bandaranaike governed from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 
to 1977 when voters rebelled against her stringent economic 
controls but she has rebounded again and is now the leading 
opposition candidate in the presidential election set for dec 19 
in bangladesh women have not captured the top office but the 
two strongest opposition leaders are women sheik hasina of the 
awami league and khaleda zia of the bangladesh nationalist party 
hasina is the daughter of sheik mujibur rahman the prime 
minister who was assassinated in a coup in 1975 mrs zia is the 
widow of another assassinated prime minister ziaur rahman who died 
in a 1981 coup 
all the women leaders have invoked the memories and the 
popularity as they perceive it of their fathers and husbands but 
none has done it as eloquently as benazir bhutto 
in the opening chapter of her recently published autobiography 
daughter of the east she recounts the moment of her fathers 
execution which was sanctioned by the man who overthrew him 
mohammed zia ulhaq 
they killed my father in the early morning hours of april 4 
1979 inside rawalpindi central jail imprisoned with my mother a 
few miles away in a deserted police training camp at sihala i felt 
the moment of my fathers death 
i suddenly sat boltupright in bed at 2 am no the scream 
burst through the knots in my throat no i couldnt breathe 
didnt want to breathe papa papa i felt so cold 
and then she resolved to avenge his death in her oftrepeated 
campaign words by restoring democracy in pakistan

benazir bhutto once recalled a day 
nearly a decade ago when she visited her father in jail as he 
awaited execution by the military regime that had toppled his 
civilian government 
i told him on my oath in his death cell i would carry on his 
work ms bhutto said 
her father former prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto was hanged 
in a rawalpindi prison in 1979 two years after being convicted in a 
murder conspiracy gen mohammad zia ulhaq who led the coup that 
unseated bhutto turned down international pleas for sparing him 
today three months after zia died in a plane crash ms bhutto 
claimed victory in national elections and is likely to become the 
first woman prime minister of a modern moslem nation 
she is the undisputed star of pakistani politics as head of the 
populist pakistan peoples party founded by her father 
the charismatic 35yearold ms bhutto inherited the grassroots 
following that brought her father to power in the 1970s in speech 
after speech to adoring crowds she has promised a better life to 
the poor rural masses that form the core of this islamic nation 
ms bhutto was groomed for politics studying by the side of her 
father then focusing on politics and government while at harvard 
and oxford 
her first taste of political success came at the british 
university where she was elected president of the oxford union 
society in 1976 
ms bhutto returned to pakistan in early 1977 to take up a job in 
the foreign office the job was shortlived however as zia toppled 
bhuttos government a few months later 
her father was accused of conspiring to murder a political 
opponent and was sentenced to death ms bhutto turned to denouncing 
zia after her struggle to have her father reprieved failed she 
wound up in jail or under house arrest for five years 
not until a serious ear infection required treatment did zia 
allow her release in 1984 to go to england in selfexile 
ms bhutto returned triumphantly to pakistan in april 1986 four 
months after zia announced an end to eight years of military rule 
she drew huge crowds as she toured the nation demanding democracy 
ecstatic crowds numbering in the hundreds of thousands would 
chant her name and wait for hours for a glimpse of her 
the stunning comeback led to inevitable comparisons with corazon 
aquino of the philippines who became president after a popular and 
military uprising against ferdinand marcos 
but zia steadfastly refused to allow elections contested by 
political parties in the meantime ms bhutto surprised many 
observers by agreeing to an arranged marriage last december with 
karachi businessman asif ali zardari that followed strict islamic 
tradition 
six months later zia fired his civilian government in july he 
set nov 16 as the date for new elections 
there was considerable speculation that zia who died in an aug 
17 plane crash chose the date because he knew ms bhutto was 
pregnant with her first child and hoped to keep her off the campaign 
trail 
but the elections came two months after ms bhutto gave birth to 
a son bilawal giving her time to make whirlwind campaign tours 
throughout the country after a brief bout with a kidney infection 
in public ms bhutto is mindful of local custom and islamic 
morality appearing with her head covered and wearing the baggy 
shalwar kameez favored by most pakistani women but she is clearly 
westernized and is as comfortable speaking english as urdu 
poised and articulate she has captivated massive crowds almost 
everywhere she travels in pakistan in early november she mounted a 
38hour 31stop railway tour aboard the greenandyellow khyber 
mail train that wound its way 1000 miles through the countrys 
hinterland 
her voice deteriorated into a barely audible rasp as she preached 
the bhutto message handed down by her late father democracy and 
prosperity to the poor masses

severe textbook shortages are undercutting 
education in urban school districts nationwide because of higher 
book prices budgetary constraints and a tendency to cut books 
before people educators complain 
one of the things about textbooks is they dont vote and they 
dont go out on strike if you cut personnel you get screams of 
anguish said harriet tysonbernstein author of a conspiracy of 
good intentions americas textbook fiasco a new book highly 
critical of the textbook industry 
a study of 31 schools in five urban districts by the 
washingtonbased institute for educational leadership released in 
september found an acrosstheboard lack of instructional 
materials including textbooks 
in general the resource situation is pretty bleak the lack of 
supplies in the school systems is pretty obvious said lisa 
walker policy resource director for the private nonprofit think 
tank this is often an area of the budget where funding is cut 
but the textbook shortage compromises educational quality some 
principals contend one of the teachers said it was like building 
a house without any nails said walker 
at mather elementary school in a workingclass boston 
neighborhood the second grade doesnt have enough math textbooks 
the fourth grade needs social studies books and the sixth grade 
lacks language texts health books are missing entirely in the 
school of 550 students 
forced to pare its budget the boston school department last 
spring eliminated 13 million in funding for instructional 
supplies leaving 37 million for textbooks paper pencils and 
other materials 
its one of the few variable costs you have in the school 
department said peter rowe deputy superintendent for planning 
and business affairs for the 58000student system higher book 
costs also have hurt 
it was a choice when we came to it between things like 
textbooks or librarians or nurses or athletic programs or field 
trips he said wednesday 
in the september study of schools in detroit denver new 
orleans indianapolis and rochester ny 20 of the 31 schools 
surveyed said they had serious problems with instructional 
materials and 19 said the level of resources was inadequate 
we know that every kid cant have every book because thats 
just not feasible said james h daniels an assistant 
superintendent in denvers 58000student district 
its always a problem resources change books change and you 
want to keep up to date and the money is not always there what a 
school has to do is some prioritizing 
in boston setting priorities has forced some schools to use more 
photocopied material than usual 60000 copies a month at mather 
many students arent allowed to take textbooks home for fear they 
will be lost or damaged teachers often spend money out of their own 
paychecks for materials others go without and work at the 
blackboard more 
school officials also said some of the citys 7000 bilingual 
program students only have new reading textbooks in spanish because 
the city failed to order enough books in english students in the 
agassiz elementary school where textbooks never go home are 
sharing readers principal alfredo nunez said 
the textbook shortage in boston comes despite a city survey of 
parents three years ago that found instructional materials were the 
no 1 priority among 25 educational issues officials increased 
funding for materials in response to the finding before the budget 
constraints forced the cutbacks this year 
national education lobbyists said cities should find other areas 
to cut before slashing resources used directly by students 
if we see education as an investment then we will provide 
those funds and wont have to make those cuts said gary marx 
associate executive director of the american association of school 
administrators in arlington va

the undersea exploration of a roman 
shipwreck will be witnessed by thousands of students via 
telepresence an onthespot tv broadcast brought to them by the 
discoverers of the wreck of the titanic 
plans for the unprecedented educational project were unveiled 
wednesday by robert ballard who led the team that found the sunken 
titanic in 1985 
students linked by satellite to at least nine science museums in 
the united states and canada will be able to communicate with 
explorers directing an unmanned mobile camera as it combs the floor 
of the mediterranean sea ballard said 
while the 6 million privately funded project involves several 
advances in technology ballard said its main purpose is to excite 
students about science a field that he said has suffered dwindling 
influence in america 
we really have a crisis of education in the united states 
ballard said at a news conference at the woods hole oceanographic 
institution in recent years he said science has failed to provide 
young people with attractive role models 
the role models they have instead are that scientists are 
nerds or as my kids would say dweebs and dweebs sit at terminals 
and are dropouts from society 
in the project the underwater robot named jason that helped 
explore the titanic will send highquality television pictures via 
cable to a ship thousands of feet above on the sea surface for 14 
days next may the ship and its 50member crew including six high 
school students will control the movements of the robot and send 
back satellite images from two underwater locations 
the broadcasts will be transmitted via the turner broadcasting 
system and electronic data systems corp to science museums in 
boston chicago memphis tenn washington dc dallas 
philadelphia rochester ny charlotte nc and victoria 
british columbia 
in addition the national geographic society plans to produce a 
tv special on the expedition 
the ships crew will broadcast six programs a day or a total of 
84 40minute programs that will be seen by about 200000 students 
instead of simply watching the programs the students will have 
before them a multiscreen control room that replicates the 
control center on the mother ship above jason students will be able 
to ask questions of the crew see images on a number of television 
screens and in some cases even take over the controls of jason 
ballard said 
ballard called the concept telepresence 
the plan is for jason to explore an undersea volcano field off 
the west coast of italy where minor eruptions emissions of molten 
minerals and an abundance of wildlife should be visible at another 
mediterranean site which ballard declined to disclose jason will 
photograph a vast debris field believed to be the remains of several 
roman shipwrecks from the second century 
ballard said the goals of the program which he calls the jason 
project are both ambitious and basic one of the major focuses 
of the program is to teach people where the mediterranean is 
ballard said 
its a tremendous interestgenerator said frank ireton of 
the national science teachers association which is helping science 
teachers who will take their classes to the programs 
if we have 200000 students and we interest 10 percent of them 
in science my gosh thats a tremendous benefit he said

mikhail gorbachevs efforts to reform his 
country have not fundamentally altered the relationship between the 
soviet union and the united states which is likely to remain 
essentially adversarial says cia director william h webster 
but gorbachevs policy of glasnost or openness has presented 
the intelligence community with some very formidable challenges 
webster told the yale political union on wednesday 
while the cia chief said the information explosion in the soviet 
union is very welcome and very healthy it also requires the 
agency to determine what is real versus what moscow wants us to 
hear 
the soviet unions military capability its efforts to increase 
global influence and its aggressive intelligence activities are 
still serious threats to united states interests gorbachevs 
efforts to reform his country have not fundamentally altered these 
truths webster said adding that they arguably may make the 
soviets an even greater threat 
webster fielded questions from students after his speech and held 
a news conference rare for a cia chief 
when asked by reporters if soviet spying had decreased as a 
result of gorbachevs policy of openness webster answered no 
when asked if soviet spying had increased he responded 
possibly adding that there is very intensive intelligence 
work he did not elaborate 
whatever arms control agreements the united states reaches with 
the soviet union he said in his speech i believe that our 
relationship is likely to remain essentially adversarial 
webster said that while gorbachev is an impressive leader when 
we watch the leadership we also have to see what actual reforms are 
being made in terms of military activity aggressive intelligence 
against the united states improvements in civil rights and all the 
things that are important to us here we are still waiting for 
progress 
on the subject of the war on drugs webster said the role of 
intelligence gathering in the battle has not been welldefined but 
that presidentelect bush is expected to change that 
he said he believes drug interdiction is the most expensive and 
least effective way to deal with the problem the only real 
solution he said lies in reduced demand coupled with a real 
reduction in supply 
asked by a student about his future as cia chief under the bush 
administration webster said he had not yet been contacted by the 
presidentelects transition team 
webster said the presidentelect a former chief of the agency 
had asked that he receive daily briefings from the cia 
defending the use of covert action in furthering us foreign 
policy webster said that as an an alternative to military action 
i think it is very important 
covert action went awry in the irancontra affair because trading 
arms for hostages was not consistent with the countrys overt 
policy webster said 
the cia was not seen to be institutionally involved in the 
irancontra affair webster said adding that the individuals who 
violated agency rules were carrying out instructions from the 
national security council

carrie white a tobaccochewing woman who 
has been been institionalized since 1909 will be certified by the 
guinness book of world records as the worlds oldest living person 
on her 114th birthday friday 
mrs white who was born in 1874 during the second term of 
president ulysses s grant and two years before custers last stand 
at little big horn will celebrate her birthday with a cake 
decorated with 114 candles and receive her formal world record 
certificate from guinness 
officials at the putnam memorial nursing center where mrs white 
lives know very little about her she has no living relatives and 
has been under hospital care for 79 years 
marjorie allen mrs whites guardian since 1984 said she 
learned four years ago that mrs white was at florida state hospital 
in chattahoochee and had been there since nov 19 1909 the day 
after her 35th birthday 
mrs white was diagnosed when she was admitted to the hospital as 
suffering from posttyphoid psychosis though mrs allen has no 
clear record of an outbreak of typhoid fever at that time 
mrs allen learned the name of mrs whites mother sally joiner 
from the commitment records at florida state hospital her fathers 
name was john 
her guardian arranged to have the woman moved to the community 
convalescence center in gainesville and she was transferred in 1986 
to the nursing home in palatka where mrs allens husband paul is 
administrator 
mrs allen said mrs white refuses to discuss the past 
she will not go back with carrie it is the now i dont delve 
into that very much its like she put up a steel wall she said 
records show mrs white taught piano in tallahassee and married 
john white who did some blacksmithing 
her daily routine at the nursing home is to have breakfast in bed 
and then spend the day caring for her possessions including dolls 
and stuffed animals 
she also likes to chew tobacco preferring red man 
you dont need teeth to chew tobacco i guess mrs allen 
said 
guinness based its decision to declare mrs white the oldest 
living person on evidence from extensive medical and state records 
according to william ihle a spokesman for beverly enterprises 
which operates the nursing home 
the 1989 guinness book of world records already published lists 
112yearold birdie may vogt of miami as the oldest living person 
others have claimed the title but guinness said it requires 
adequate authentication

two researchers who helped explain the chemical 
origins of life a doctor who developed methadone treatment for 
heroin addicts and a us senator have received the 1988 albert 
lasker awards 
the lasker awards announced wednesday have been given for 43 
years and have often foreshadowed the awarding of nobel prizes 
fortysix lasker award winners have gone on to win nobels 
thomas r cech of the university of colorado boulder and 
phillip a sharp director of the cancer research center at the 
massachusetts institute of technology were awarded the lasker basic 
medical research award for their separate discoveries concerning the 
workings of rna one of the genetic building blocks on which life 
depends 
the lasker clinical medical research award went to dr vincent p 
dole of rockefeller university in new york city for discoveries 
concerning the physiological basis of drug addiction and the 
development of methadone as an effective treatment 
us sen lowell p weicker jr rconn who was defeated in his 
bid for reelection nov 8 was awarded the lasker public service 
award for his defense of health care programs faced by crippling 
budget cuts and for establishing new programs 
each lasker award winner receives or shares a 15000 honorarium 
one of this years winners of the nobel prize in medicine dr 
james w black won a lasker award in 1976 
cech a biochemist was cited for his discovery that rna once 
thought to be merely a kind of genetic messenger inside cells 
could rearrange itself to change the message 
he also found that the rna or ribonucleic acid has a 
rudimentary ability to reproduce itself suggesting that the first 
living things might have arisen ultimately from rna 
earlier sharp had reported that only part of rna carried genetic 
instructions to govern the operation of cells certain segments of 
rna called introns are deleted from rna as it is processed and 
the remaining segments called exons contain the instructions 
dole began his studies of addiction in the 1960s after obtaining 
permission to study heroin addicts outside of prison he examined 
the symptoms of withdrawal and the nature of addiction 
ultimately he found that methadone a synthetic opiate developed 
in germany during world war ii could eliminate an addicts craving 
for heroin without making the addict high that allowed addicts 
to hold jobs and resume normal lives 
weicker was cited in part for his compassion and dedication 
in the fight to eradicate disease and disability through federal 
funding of medical research and public health programs 
among the beneficiaries of his legislative actions were disabled 
children the mentally ill the elderly and people suffering from 
cancer alzheimers disease arthritis and aids the lasker 
foundation said

a dramatic increase in tranquilizer use by 
cocaine abusers is worrying counselors nationwide who fear the 
double dangers of dual addictions 
tranquilizers like valium used to ease the crash of a 
cocaine high by calming nerves and relieving paranoia are becoming 
a second drug of choice among cocaine users according to a study 
released wednesday by the citys haight ashbury free clinic 
but cocaine users particularly those who smoke the potent form 
known as crack take tranquilizers in such quantity that the effects 
are reversed and users often become more agitated unpredictable and 
violent said david smith the clinics founder and medical director 
the dualdrug phenomenon parallels the speedballing 
habits of heroin addicts 20 years ago who supplemented their 
barbiturates with amphetamines he said 
valium and the tranquilizer xanax which overtook valium last 
year as the mostprescribed benzodiazepine tranquilizer in the 
country are longacting drugs that can produce seizures when taken 
at high doses they also can lead to severe addictions that are hard 
to kick smith said 
we believe we have identified a valid trend nationwide and 
other independent sources support it said smith 
the study surveyed 3000 workers in 339 chemical dependency 
treatment programs across the nation on a variety of questions it 
found that many reported a growing dualdrug problem 
data on hospital emergency room drug overdoses addiction 
treatment admissions and law enforcement seizure statistics support 
the study results smith said in san francisco emergency room 
overdoses have increased 77 percent this year compared to 1987 
the emergency room data suggest not only were we correct but 
its worse than we thought said smith its clearly a trend and 
weve not peaked out yet 
smith said the widespread dualdrug phenomenon warrants expanded 
treatment centers supplyreduction efforts and education programs 
for drug users and physicians 
although cocaine users also use alcohol to take the edge off 
smith said researchers are particularly fearful of the 
cocainetranquilizer combination 
when you combine two drugs it multiplies instead of one 
plus one equalling two its three four five or six said hal 
linebarger a chemical dependency therapist at a center south of san 
francisco they cancel each other out but it ends up being much 
more poisonous to the system 
tranquilizers can ease the emotional and physical depression that 
follows a cocaine high linebarger explained 
a secondary dependence on tranquilizers can go unnoticed by a 
cocaine addict smith said physicians may prescribe tranquilizers 
for patients who complain of feeling anxious and paranoid not 
realizing the symptoms are a result of cocaine use he said 
prescription tranquilizers also are available on the street 
through wholesale diversions and international smuggling he said 
although the cocaine epidemic appeared to be leveling off in 
1983 the introduction of crack cocaine in 1984 produced record 
levels of dualdrug dependence smith said 
any time you see an increase in an upper youll see an 
increase in downers and any time you see an increase in downers 
youll see an increase in uppers he said smokable forms of 
cocaine are really the fuel for this 
the study was conducted by the training and education section of 
the haight ashbury free clinic in conjunction with the research 
division of the merrittperalta chemical dependency recovery 
hospital in oakland

israeli troops shot and wounded 10 palestinians 
in clashes in the occupied lands today and the army eased a sixday 
curfew aimed at blocking violence fueled by the palestinian 
declaration of independence 
defense minister yitzhak rabin dismissed the declaration of a 
palestinian state in the israelioccupied territories as a plo 
deception attempt and israel launched a diplomatic offensive on 
wednesday to counter it 
hospital officials said 10 palestinians were shot and wounded 
when soldiers opened fire on rioting youths near nablus in the west 
bank and several areas of the gaza strip among the wounded were a 
15yearold girl shot in the back and a 34yearold woman hit in the 
left thigh they said 
the army said it was checking the reports 
in arab east jersualem today two israeli policemen were injured 
by rocks at an arab boys school police spokesman rafi levy said 
he said riot police then entered rashadiye school and arrested eight 
students 
a teacher said trouble started when police arrived to quiet 
students singing palestinian patriotic songs in the schools 
courtyard the teacher would not give his name 
the army lifted curfews from several towns in the gaza strip 
home to 650000 palestinians but kept curfews in effect for the 
250000 who live in refugee camps a curfew also was maintained on 
the nur shams refugee camp near tulkarem in the west bank 
telephone lines remained cut off to homes and businesses for a 
seventh day in the west bank cities of hebron nablus ramallah and 
jenin but the army said they would be restored during the day 
the lines were severed to prevent palestinians from coordinating 
antiisraeli activities during the meeting in algiers of the plos 
parliamentinexile which ended tuesday with the declaration of 
independence 
the government meanwhile confirmed that defense minister 
yitzhak rabin ordered israel television not to show scenes of 
jubilation at the palestine national council meeting in order not to 
incite palestinians in the territories 
rabin who has been defense minister in charge of quelling 
violence during the 11month palestinian uprising told israel 
television wednesday night that quiet could be restored in three to 
six months 
i believe that the events of the last several days can become a 
turning point leading to a significant decrease in violence he 
said 
he expressed hope that many palestinians would be content with 
achieving their aim and allowing the political process but said 
israel should continue to supress violence and block the plo 
deception attempt by political action 
in jerusalem on wednesday foreign ministry officials announced a 
diplomatic campaign against the palestine liberation organizations 
drive for recognition of its selfproclaimed state 
the effort will focus on the plos failure to renounce terrorism 
to accept un resolution 242 unconditionally or to clearly 
recognize israel one official said he said israel will argue that 
the resolution which implicitly recognizes the the jewish states 
right to exist cannot be amended 
the plo said it was accepting the resolution on condition the 
palestinian right to selfdetermination is also recognized 
palestinian hardliners said they opposed the declaration and the 
fundamentalist moslem hamas zeal movement called a threeday 
general strike to protest the declarations implicit recognition of 
israel 
foreign minister shimon peres complained that recognition of the 
wouldbe palestinian state would interfere with any peace process 
he told reporters that recognition now by more than 20 mostly 
arab countries further complicates the situation by supporting 
something that shouldnt be supported 
on wednesday palestinians kept up their nightly revelry 
celebrating the algiers independence statement youths danced in the 
streets in the west bank city of bethlehem and firecrackers rounded 
through gaza city 
a 25yearold man wounded in the head three days ago in the gaza 
strip town of rafah died wednesday raising to 313 the number of 
palestinians killed in the nearly yearlong uprising against 21 
years of israeli occupation eleven israelis also have died 
also in gaza military appeals court rejected appeals of eight 
arab activists slated for deportation but upheld two other appeals 
conditional on approval of military officials israel television 
said it said the eight planned to appeal to israels supreme court 
since the uprising started israel has deported 33 palestinians

the kidnapping charge in little rock municipal court 
ms smith was arrested at her hot springs home monday after

about 50 people claimed victory today and 
ended a fiveday fast aimed at forcing officials to rehire the last 
of about 100 workers dismissed for roles in polands worst labor 
unrest in seven years 
agreement was reached through the mediation of the roman catholic 
bishop in katowice said adam slomka a spokesman for the fasters 
protesting since saturday in the christ the king cathedral in the 
southern city 
we managed to achieve in five days what hadnt been achieved in 
several months said slomka speaking by telephone from the 
cathedral 
the nations bishops and lech walesa leader of the banned 
solidarity independent labor movement had appealed for the miners 
reinstatement the opposition said rehiring them was a condition for 
participating in talks with the government 
slomka said agreement was reached late wednesday with the 
national coal federation to reinstate the workers today the strikes 
were in august 
bishop damian zimon led a delegation that met with provincial 
officials on tuesday slomka said adding that two more negotiating 
sessions wednesday led to the agreement 
he said the workers won job reinstatements for all the dismissed 
workers except two workers at the stalowa wola steel mill in the 
southeast the church will continue to mediate in that case he said 
tadeusz napieracz a deputy director at the coal federation the 
body that oversees the mines said the miners are returning to 
their old posts as of tomorrow he denied they ever had been fired 
and said officials had wanted to to give them new positions while 
the miners insisted on their old jobs 
solidarity national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz said in warsaw 
that the the decision should have been mede several months ago 
let us hope other positive signs will follow 
the hunger protest began early saturday after a proindependence 
march friday night turned violent organizers say about 250 people 
took shelter from police inside the cathedral in katowice about 170 
miles southeast of warsaw 
at the urging of one miner about 80 of the people began a hunger 
strike originally aimed at winning freedom for detained fellow 
demonstrators 
but after those demonstrators were freed the fasters decided to 
adopt the cause of the fired miners 
andrzej polmanski whom authorities have said is a ringleader of 
the august strike at the andaluzja coal mine said the fasters 
included 16 dismissed miners students and various opposition 
activists comprised the rest 
the opposition originally counted 103 workers as fired or drafted 
into the army for joining the august strikes for higher pay and 
legalization of solidarity he said the number of those still not 
rehired had fallen to 49 miners and the two steelworkers by this 
week he said 
polmanski said the issue was broader than individual jobs if 
authorities succeeded in firing strike leaders it would make 
workers less willing to fight for their rights in the future he 
said 
the question also became a stumbling block to talks between the 
opposition and authorities on polands future and the legalization 
of solidarity which was crushed in a 1981 military crackdown 
walesa agreed to end the august strikes after the government agreed 
to the talks 
walesa has said he will not come to the table until officials 
honor a promise by interior minister gen czeslaw kiszczak at the 
end of august that strikers would not be fired 
also blocking the talks is the governments objection to two 
longtime solidarity activists walesa has refused to remove from the 
opposition delegation jacek kuron and adam michnik 
solidarity also has insisted that the government reverse its 
decision to close the lenin shipyard in gdansk where solidarity was 
born in an august 1980 strike wave 
on wednesday the episcopate secretariat which represents roman 
catholic bishops nationwide criticized plans to close the shipyard 
and said it was a political act not facilitating reconciliation

this country isnt going to the dogs in fact 
more americans now consider a cat the purrfect pet and birds 
are soaring in popularity 
for the first time ever cats are more popular with american pet 
owners apparently because of the advent of the yuppie the american 
veterinary medical association said wednesday 
with more and more apartment living a cat is just a better pet 
to own a dog needs a lot of attention a person has to hurry from 
work to walk a dog karen gavzer marketing director for the avma 
said in a telephone interview 
the us cat population reached an estimated 546 million at the 
end of 1987 compared with 524 million dogs according to a study 
of 40000 households by charles research group of overland park kan 
birds are moving up in the rankings faster than any other 
creature the number of pet birds rose 24 percent from 104 million 
to 129 million between 1983 when a previous survey was taken and 
the new study 
a bird is even more of a yuppie pet said dr ann clark an 
avma veterinarian the big birds are not cheap the more exotic 
ones cost thousands of dollars 
the us cat population increased 46 percent and the dog 
population declined 58 percent between the two studies said the 
avma based in suburban schaumburg 
people used to get a cat or bird until they could get a real 
pet but people are finding out that cats and birds are real pets 
said ms clark 
some of the big exotic birds live 60 or 70 years bringing 
pleasure to two or three generations of one family she said 
the total number of cats dogs birds and horses kept by 
americans increased less than 1 percent to 126 million when 
hamsters fish turtles snakes and rabbits are counted the total 
climbs to more than 200 million creatures closing in on the 
nations human population of 245 million as of last january 
the typical pet owner researchers said is a large family with 
children living outside a metropolitan area with an aboveaverage 
income and more than one pet 
they also found that people in western and southern states keep 
more pets the leading catowning states are oregon maine idaho 
vermont and washington the study indicated dogs are tops in 
nevada wyoming mississippi and new mexico

the spokeswoman for george bushs presidential 
transition team today answered warnings from the chairman of the 
federal reserve board about the deficit by saying that economists 
never agree on anything 
sheila tate also said in a television interview that 
presidentelect bushs first appointments to his economic team have 
sent a very clear signal to investors that by and large helped 
calm the markets 
bush aides have been scrambling to ease fears about the deficit 
and concerns about the vice presidents pledge not to raise taxes 
which have sent stocks tumbling at home and put the alreadyweak 
dollar into a further tailspin in international markets 
the dollar fell today to a 15year low against the japanese yen 
despite reported central bank intervention in tokyo the dow fell 
more than 38 points wednesday and had dropped almost 90 points to a 
2month low since last weeks election 
federal reserve chairman alan greenspan added the strongest voice 
yet to calls for action on the deficit telling a national 
commission wednesday the red ink already has begun to eat away at 
the foundations of our economic strength and the need to deal with 
it is becoming ever more urgent 
greenspan who was appointed to the federal reserve post by 
president reagan addressed questions of a possible tax increase by 
saying how the deficit is reduced is far less relevant than that 
it is done 
asked on abctvs good morning america about his warning 
tate said 
economists never agree on anything for every economist you 
cite we can trot out one who is diametrically in opposition 
asked whether bush as president would be at odds with greenspan 
tate said 
its traditional economists simply dont agree with each other 
and theres a lot of jockeying going on right now we just have to 
wait and see what presidentelect bush decides to do 
theres a lot of talk now swirling about the deficit she 
said i think his appointment of treasury secretary nicholas 
brady gave a very clear signal as to the kind of administration hes 
going to have and i think by and large helped calm the markets 
investors in the united states and abroad have attributed some of 
the bad economic news to strong campaign statement of read my lips 
no new taxes 
i think its that traditional nervousness with change tate 
said of the market plunge 
he bush has said time and time again he wants to meet with 
congress hes expressed conciliatory gestures i think theyll 
work together to deal with the issue she said 
greenspan was one of several witnesses who told the national 
economic commission which is studying how to deal with the deficit 
that the problem has been too long ignored 
this country is imperiled and it is going to take a whole lot 
of guts to face this fact and deal with it said william brock 
who was labor secretary under reagan 
the fed chief testified that the deficit is more likely to be cut 
permanently through spending cuts rather than tax increases because 
congressmen tend to spend new revenues from taxes but he added that 
any longrange plan would help lower interest rates regardless of 
its components

personal freedoms 
the decree had been in effect since june following the discovery 
of illegally imported weapons including automatic rifles from the 
soviet union hand grenades and ammunition 
in a statement tonight information minister ratu imoke kubuaeola 
said the internal security decree was intended to close gaps in 
existing laws to ensure security in this south pacific nation which 
has experienced two coups in 1 years 
the decree limited freedom of movement and expression and allowed 
searches and detentions without charges being filed 
now that most of the illegal arms have been recovered and 
greater peace and stability exists in the country it was the view 
of cabinet that the time was right for the isd to be suspended 
kubuaeoloa said after a cabinet meeting 
at the same time the government deployed troops outside 
government buildings and the capitals two radio stations it was 
not clear if that was related to the lifting of the security decree 
the soldiers were not carrying arms

a treasury department staff group is 
considering a plan using taxpayer money to rescue the ailing savings 
and loan system in return for direct administration supervision of 
the bailout an administration official says 
the administration would prefer some sort of offbudget financing 
for the sampl cleanup but theyre convinced one way or another that 
the treasury has to participate the official speaking on 
condition of anonymity said wednesday 
kenneth guenther executive vice president of the independent 
bankers association of america a trade group said vice president 
george bushs advisers are very seriously looking at creating a 
presidential panel to control rescue expenditures 
in thrift rescues to date the federal home loan bank board 
which regulates sampls has been criticized for making openended 
guarantees to private investors taking over failed institutions and 
for not requiring the investors to risk more of their own money 
guenther said the structure of the new board would be similar to 
the one created this year to oversee the bailout of the farm credit 
system 
the administration official confirmed that the option was being 
considered by the treasury staff but said i dont think theyve 
reached any conclusions yet 
essentially it says well give you the money but we want 
some control the official said 
in the rescue of the farm credit system which provides loans to 
farmers congress guaranteed the systems borrowing and provided a 
line of credit to the treasury however it required that a 
threemember panel including the secretaries of the treasury and 
agriculture approve bailout expenditures 
the official also confirmed a report published wednesday in the 
washington post which said the administration plan would require 
20 billion to 30 billion a year for three years 
an acknowledgment that taxpayer money is required would represent 
a shift in policy bank board chairman m danny wall has maintained 
that the savings industry could continue to pay for rescuing failed 
institutions although only if a special fee on healthy institutions 
continued for 30 years 
treasury undersecretary george gould has said there is a limit to 
what the industry can pay but he has not said yet if the problem 
exceeds it 
gould did not return a telephone call seeking comment wednesday 
treasury department spokesman arthur siddon declined to comment on 
the task forces work karl hoyle a bank board spokesman said wall 
was traveling and could not be reached immediately 
the savings and loan crisis is shaping up as one of the chief 
challenges facing bush the bank board estimates it will cost up to 
50 billion to close or merge failed institutions private analysts 
put the cost as high as 100 billion 
according to the federal deposit insurance corp which insures 
commercial banks sampl losses are growing at a rate of 15 billion a 
year 
the need for potentially huge expenditures comes at a time when 
foreign investors who buy much of the us governments debt are 
demanding that bush who pledged not to raise taxes reduce the 
budget deficit 
the treasury task force formulating the administrations position 
is looking to complete its work next month 
treasury secretary nicholas f brady who will continue in his 
position in the bush administration ordered the review shortly 
after taking office in september 
robert r glauber the harvard business school professor who was 
staff director for the stock market crash study that brady conducted 
last year for president reagan heads the task force

about 2000 gallons of radioactive water overflowed 
a collection area during maintenance at the pilgrim nuclear plant 
and some of it seeped outdoors into a parking lot the plants owner 
said 
one worker was slightly contaminated 
peter agnes gov michael dukakis chief aide on nuclear power 
said elevated levels of radioactivity were detected as far away as 
the perimeter fence he gave no indication of whether the spill 
posed a threat to the public 
the spill occurred wednesday at a lowlevel nuclear waste 
processing area at the plant which is awaiting word from the 
nuclear regulatory commission on whether it can begin lowlevel 
power testing after a 2year shutdown 
about 100 gallons seeped outside the processing facility and onto 
an asphalt truck parking lot boston edison co spokeswoman elaine 
robinson said the water inside and out was mopped up she said 
karl abraham an nrc spokesman said the commission may call in a 
special inspector to investigate 
the normal routine followup would be by the resident 
inspectors he said but with all of the attention focusing on 
pilgrim we cant rule out the possibility that something else will 
happen such as sending a specialist to look at this 
the plant has been closed because of management and equipment 
problems 
agnes assistant secretary of public safety said he sent a 
public health department team to report on the cleanup and get 
information on what caused the spill 
since we are speaking about a substantial amount of waste water 
and an exposure that at least resulted in elevated readings as far 
out as the perimeter its a significant event agnes said 
the accident happened in a waste processing area during 
preparations for shipping a container of waste from the plant the 
water was being filtered through earth to remove radioactivity the 
earth was to be shipped to a storage facility in barnwell sc 
robinson said 
a plant operator making a tour of the plant discovered that the 
water had overflowed and immediately cut off the water she said 
the workers knee touched some water during the cleanup and was 
washed with soap and water edison spokesman john fidler said 
the level of contamination on his knee was just barely above 
the minimum level where we say something is contaminated instead of 
clean fidler said 
he said the plant has roped off and is testing the area around 
the spill

a lake bottom 
us aviation underwriters called off its search at a 
recreational lake for blan stewart and the singleengine plane he

there is so rough its like finding a needle in a haystack 
stewart a 45yearold former agent with travelers corp 
disappeared oct 31 while en route from vero beach fla to 
huntsville flying into blustery weather to the north 
some of those involved in the search speculated that stewart 
ditched the piper cherokee or staged a crash and his death to escape 
having to stand trial on charges of theft by deception that could 
bring up to 100 years in prison 
if hes not at the bottom of that lake hes a fugitive from 
justice said holly wiseman an assistant state attorney general

plane to stewart

a liquid diet like the one that shaved 67 pounds 
off talkshow host oprah winfrey should be attempted only by certain 
people after conventional diets fail and under a physicians 
supervision dietitians say 
after winfrey discussed her fourmonth slimdown tuesday on her 
show about 5000 telephone calls an hour began to pour into sandoz 
nutrition corp which sells the optifast diet program she used 
said company spokesman jim parsons 
the optifast program is offered to the public only by hospitals 
and physicians parsons said 
but liquid diet programs were not made for the majority of 
dieters who want to lose 10 or 15 pounds said mary lee chin a 
denver consulting dietitian and spokesperson for the american 
dietetic association 
such programs generally should be considered only by people who 
exceed their ideal weight by at least 20 percent or who face a 
medical risk because of their weight chin said liquid diets also 
should be tried only if conventional diets fail she said wednesday 
people also should avoid liquid diets if they are pregnant or 
have kidney or liver diseases cancer or a recent heart attack she 
said 
chin also listed diabetics who requires insulin but karen miller 
kovach assistant director of nutrition services at the cleveland 
clinic said she considered diabetics potentially eligible after a 
thorough evaluation 
chin and kovach warned against buying liquid diet products at 
stores and using them without medical supervision 
for one thing liquid diets provide essentially a starvation diet 
of 800 calories a day or fewer and that can cause medical harm 
unless the symptoms of excessive calorie deprivation are spotted 
early chin said for example such a diet can cause muscle wasting 
as well as mineral imbalances that can lead to heart malfunctioning 
she said 
medical supervision also helps in dealing with side effects of 
the diets which can include dizziness constipation dry skin hair 
loss and intolerance to cold temperatures chin said 
in addition kovach said people who follow a liquid diet without 
supervision may not realize they have such conditions as kidney 
disease that mean they should avoid such diets 
and people who do the diets on their own tend to regain the 
weight they lost once they return to solid food kovach said they 
miss a key component of supervised liquid diet programs a 
maintenance program that teaches how to keep the weight off she 
said 
maintenance programs stress the importance of exercise and 
changing behavior that led to the excess weight chin said winfrey 
on her show pointed out that the fact that she lost the weight 
doesnt mean she can keep it off without exercise chin said 
apart from looking for medical supervision and a maintenance 
program that will allow significant individual attention chin and 
kovach offered these tips for choosing a liquid diet program 
make sure the diet provides highquality protein which includes 
the eight essential amino acids and that it fulfills the 
recommended dietary allowances for vitamins minerals and protein 
the protein will be high quality if it is from an animal source 
chin said 
besides a physician the program should include a nutritionist 
an exercise physiologist and a behavioral counselor to help keep 
weight off 
ask about longterm success rates one program says that after 
25 years 18 percent to 41 percent of dieters keep off the weight 
they lost which is a significant success rate chin said if 
the program offers no statistics she said id look at another 
program 
look for an incentive to keep dieters in the program such as 
prizes or other rewards for weight loss

chicagos roughandtumble city council has passed 
a measure designed to curb sexual racial or ethnic insults during 
committee hearings 
the measure passed 2518 wednesday despite objections from 
several aldermen that it would restrict their rights in questioning 
mayoral appointees or witnesses 
the resolution was introduced by alderwoman kathy osterman in 
reaction to what she felt were irrelevant and inappropriate 
questions of witnesses 
the resolution says religious beliefs gender and heritage 
shall be considered irrelevant and inappropriate considerations in 
the decisions regarding appointment confirmations or eligibility to 
present testimony 
alderman robert shaw insisted that the measure would infringe on 
the councils right to be vigilant and protect the public 
interest in addition to barring questioning of membership in such 
groups as the ku klux klan 
shaw was accused last month by a jewish organization of 
jewbaiting during a committee hearing a charge he denied 
osterman insisted the measure was not designed to stifle 
responsible questioning

a gilbert stuart portrait of george washington 
that sold in london for 497000 was sold in new york five months 
earlier for only 3300 because of questions about its authenticity 
says a report published today 
the painting of the president in a dark blue coat and white neck 
cloth sold wednesday for more than five times its top estimate 
both sothebys in london which auctioned the painting wednesday 
and christies east in new york which auctioned it earlier this 
year said they had asked marvin sadik an expert on washington 
portraits about the paintings authenticity and had based their 
descriptions on his opinion the new york times reported 
sadik former director of the smithsonian institutions national 
portrait gallery in washington and now a consultant and art dealer 
in falmouth maine told the times he had seen only photographs of 
the painting he also said he was not paid for the opinions he had 
given 
a christies spokeswoman roberta maneker said the work had been 
consigned in 1987 as a george washington painting in the style of 
gilbert stuart she declined to identify the paintings owner 
debra force a christies specialist in american paintings said 
she showed the actual painting to sadik in new york last november or 
december because of doubts about its authenticty and sadik said it 
was not by stuart the times said 
but sadik said he could not recall seeing the painting 
james miller specialist in british paintings at sothebys in 
london told the times that a briton purchased the painting in new 
york brought it to london and recognized what the painting was 
it was auctioned as a stuart painting 
the painting was purchased wednesday by the berryhill gallery of 
new york miller who conducted the auction said it had belonged to 
president james madison and had hung in madisons virginia home 
sothebys had estimated its value at only 54000 to 90500 
because it was one of more than 100 portraits of the president that 
stuart painted after washington died in 1799 miller said

the kremlin today said it was calling estonian 
leaders to moscow to discuss the tiny baltic republics challenge to 
central soviet control 
the first official reaction to the vote of the estonian supreme 
soviet on wednesday was announced by the official tass news agency 
while the parliament in a second baltic republic lithuania was 
meeting to consider similar action 
estonian legislators passed an amendment to their own 
constitution wednesday requiring local ratification of new soviet 
laws 
taking into consideration that the amendment and a number of 
other documents adopted by the estonian parliament are at variance 
with provisions of the current constitution the presidium of the 
ussr supreme soviet has decided to consider the abovementioned 
issue at its next meeting with representatives of the estonian 
republic to be invited tass said 
the tone of the tass statement was measured and appeared to stop 
short of an outright declaration that the estonian parliaments 
action was unconstitutional 
it did not say when the meeting would take place but presumably 
it would be called before the next full meeting of the 1500member 
national supreme soviet which is scheduled for nov 29 
estonian officials were called to a meeting with president 
mikhail s gorbachev at the presidium on nov 9 kremlin officials 
listened but did not support their demands for greater autonomy 
two days later politburo members were sent to estonia lithuania and 
the third baltic republic latvia to preach restraint 
baltic residents are angry about proposed amendments to the 
national constitution that they say takes away the republics right 
to secede and further strengthen central control rather than 
encouraging the local control that gorbachev stresses is necessary 
for his reform movement to succeed 
tass announced that lithuanian supreme soviet had begun its 
meeting in the capital of vilnius where it was expected to take up 
legislation similar to that passed in tallinn estonia 
the vote of 2581 with five abstentions on the declaration of 
sovereignty in all areas except foreign and defense policy followed 
a restrained serious debate in the estonian supreme soviet 
the declaration calls for a treaty with moscow that would 
determine the further status of estonia in the composition of the 
soviet union 
in 1940 the soviet union annexed the baltic republics which 
have looked toward the west and rankled under soviet control 
proponents of the estonian action said it was consistent with 
gorbachevs calls for greater democratization and local control and 
with ritual declarations of autonomy for the republics contained in 
the soviet constitution 
marju lauristen a leader of the estonian peoples front a 
nationalist mass movement said gorbachev might be angry at first 
but when he thinks deeply hell think weve supported

a judge today acquitted three 
people but said others in a trial involving leaders of the nations 
largest antiapartheid group committed treason during township 
uprisings a crime punishable by death 
the judgment by supreme court justice kees van dijkhorst means 
some of the 16 remaining defendants could face the death penalty 
the decision summed up a 3year trial involving members of the 
united democratic front who were charged with treason terrorism 
murder and subversion 
van dijkhorst in the third day of reading his 1521page 
judgment did not say which defendants were guilty of treason the 
verdicts against individual defendants might not be announced until 
next week 
all the defendants pleaded innocent to the charges which related 
to allegations the antiapartheid front and its affiliates sought to 
promote violence during unrest in black townships in 1984 
the three most prominent defendants are senior front leaders who 
were denied bail throughout the trial and have spent 40 months in 
jail they are popo molefe 36 who was the groups national 
secretary terror lekota 40 who was its publicity secretary and 
moses chikane 40 who was secretary of its transvaal province 
branch 
those acquitted today were the rev geoff motselane 41 oupa 
hlomuka 35 and patrick baleka 29 unlike most of the defendants 
they were not closely linked in testimony to the front or to the 
first wave of unrest in an area called the vaal triangle 
the group was formed in 1983 to mobilize opposition to a new 
constitution that created a threechamber parliament with 
representation for every group except the black majority the group 
is now banned 
van dijkhorst said that because violence was a necessary 
intended part of the uprising in the townships the state had proved 
the crime of treason 
the charges of murder which also carry a possible death penalty 
relate to the mob killings of black town council members during the 
outbreak of the unrest in the townships south of johannesburg 
van dijkhorst noted that the violence began after president pw 
botha took the oath of office under the new constitution and the 
tricameral parliament was announced sept 2 1984 
he acknowledged that many people joined the antiapartheid front 
because they were disenchanted with the government but said many 
had closed their eyes not wanting to know that their 
aspirations for peaceful change could lead to revolt 
since the trial began most of the front leaders who are not in 
detention or in hiding have been restricted to their homes and 
prohibited from making speeches being quoted or participating in 
any political activity 
before its banning in february the front was the largest 
opposition group in south africas history encompassing more than 
600 affiliated groups with about 2 million members 
van dijkhorst said he agreed with prosecutors that the front was 
supported and guided by the african national congress the biggest 
guerrilla movement fighting south africas whiteled government 
the front has maintained that it endorsed the ancs political 
goals such as a oneperson onevote system but did not approve of 
violence 
originally there were 22 defendants in the trial three other 
men were acquitted in 1986 
van dijkhorst has presided over the nonjury trial since its 
start in june 1985 and has sole responsibility for the verdict and 
sentencing 
under apartheid the 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

the government today banned a 
white supremacist group after a selfproclaimed white racist was 
charged with shooting to death six blacks during a casual walk 
through pretoria 
barend strydom 23 was ordered to undergo treatment at a 
psychiatric hospital after a court hearing in which he appeared in 
khaki clothes and leg irons 
strydom a former policeman smiled throughout the hearing before 
magistrate p johnson he said he had no desire to cooperate with 
the court 
later the government banned the small white liberation movement 
the first time such action has been taken against a rightwing 
group strydom has been linked to two extremist organizations 
including the large afrikaner resistance movement but not to the 
white liberation movement 
both groups have swastikatype symbols and have expressed 
sympathy for the nazis 
law and order minister adriaan vlok imposed the ban under 
national emergency regulations which have also been used to ban 23 
antiapartheid organizations he did not explain why the white 
liberation movement in particular was outlawed 
the movement was formed in 1985 but did not come to public notice 
until 1987 its leader johan schabort said it has more than 1000 
members but many more sympathizers 
he said the governments action reduced the outlet for 
frustration of white south africans now we cannot control 
people who are worried about their race survival some of them could 
organize underground 
schabort a biochemist said his group supports banishment of all 
jewish and indian south africans to israel or india and removal of 
all blacks from white urban centers including the clearing out 
of soweto home to 25 million blacks outside johannesburg 
he said the group does not support violence and added i fully 
blame the government for what happened in pretoria on tuesday 
whites are living under tremendous pressure and are being 
undermined by blacks schabort said 
the shooting spree prompted government officials to promise a 
broad crackdown on white extremists 
dr willem pieterse a courtappointed psychiatrist who examined 
the suspect said strydom showed symptoms of being a psychopath and 
had expressed pride in what he had done 
strydom was sent to weskoppies hospital for 30 days of 
observation and ordered to reappear in court dec 19 
he was charged with murdering six blacks and attempting to murder 
17 as he walked smiling and laughing through downtown pretoria 
firing an automatic pistol 
speaking in afrikaans strydom told the court if communists 
such as anglican archbishop desmond tutu and former south african 
ambassador to the united kingdom dennis worrall are arrested then 
i will cooperate 
strydom frequently turned to wave at his family in the courtroom 
which was packed and guarded by policemen with shotguns in an 
unusual move photographers were allowed inside 
nic strydom a retired policeman who is a member of the movement 
and another son were present wearing business suits 
members of the movement frequently dress in khaki uniforms and 
wear swastikatype emblems and weapons 
critics of the white minority government frequently have 
questioned why rightwing white organizations which appear to 
espouse violence are not banned while antiapartheid organizations 
are outlawed 
a member of the governing national party raised the question 
again wednesday a government official said an investigation would 
have to be conducted 
under apartheid south africas 26 million blacks have not vote 
in national affairs and the countrys 5 million whites control the 
economy and maintain separate residential districts schools and 
health services

le figaro newspaper described this years batch of beaujolais as 
more nuanced more subtle and more traditional than last years

elections in 11 years and today called on the president to let her 
form the new government

democracy dignity justice and technology the 35yearold 
politician told reporters at her family villa in southern sind 
province 
the useducated ms bhutto would be the first woman to lead a 
moslem nation if she is chosen to form the government pakistan was 
run by gen mohammed zia ulhaq until his death aug 17 in a plane 
crash 
ms bhuttos pakistan peoples party captured 92 seats in the 
237member national assembly easily outpacing its main rival the 
rightwing islamic democratic alliance which won 55 seats 
independent candidates and minor parties captured 57 seats 
results from 13 races were not available 
the remaining 20 seats will be filled by women chosen by the 
elected assembly members 
two of the alliances three major figures including former prime 
minister mohammad khan junejo were defeated by peoples party 
candidates 
about 30 political parties fielded candidates but the campaign 
boiled down to a race between the peoples party and the nineparty 
alliance which includes loyalists of zia 
ms bhutto said president ghulam ishaq khan should now call 
upon the ppp to form the government which would allow her to 
recapture the prime ministership her father lost in a 1977 coup 
she said the peoples party had already started talking with 
other leftleaning parties and said forming a governing coalition 
would not be difficult 
the countrys constitution requires ishaq khan to choose a prime 
minister who will be most likely to command the confidence of the 
majority of the national assembly but he is under no deadline to 
act 
asked wednesday whether he would be reluctant to designate a 
woman as head of government of this maledominated soceity ishaq 
khan replied i think a woman prime minister might be a good 
change 
the army pledged had not interfere in wednesdays balloting and 
thousands of soldiers and police were deployed for the election 
which was largely peaceful 
junejo once the undisputed leader of the alliancedominating 
pakistan muslim league was defeated in his hometown of sindhri by a 
peoples party candidate 
the chairman of the alliance and leader of the centerright 
national peoples party ghulam mustafa jatoi lost to peoples 
party candidates in both districts he contested 
the alliances leading political strongman punjab chief minister 
nawaz sharif was assured a seat from lahore 
ms bhutto in a show of her personal popularity won all three 
seats she was contesting 
candidates could contest more than one seat to improve their 
chance of election but must forfeit all but one the vacant seats 
are contested later 
while she monitored election results about 5000 supporters 
gathered in the streets outside dancing and chanting benazir 
prime minister 
officials reported no major violence or fraud in the nationwide 
balloting despite widespread fears of disruption newspapers today 
reported three electionrelated deaths but the incidents could not 
be immediately confirmed 
the election focused on political personalities 
ms bhuttos father was zulfikar ali bhutto whose government was 
toppled by zia in 1977 zia had him hanged two years later 
she proved a charismatic campaigner drawing enthusiastic crowds 
numbering in the tens of thousands throughout the country 
ms bhutto and the alliance both pledged to continue close ties 
with the united states to support anticommunist guerrillas in 
neighboring afghanistan and to stick to zias program to make 
pakistan a more islamic nation 
but she said she would not allow the religious policy to harm 
womens and minorities rights considered very westernized she 
studied at harvard and oxford 
about 48 million of pakistans 107 million people were eligible 
to vote and unofficial estimates said slightly more than half voted 
illiterate millions chose their candidates by symbol and men and 
women voted separately in keeping with strict moslem practice 
zia ruled for eight years under martial law before holding 
national elections in 1985 ms bhuttos party and other opposition 
groups boycotted those polls allowing a sweep by candidates who 
barely hid their ties to the muslim league 
the league formed a government under junejo but zia abruptly 
fired the junejo cabinet in may and dissolved the national assembly 
accusing them of corruption incompetence and dragging their feet on 
islamization 
several muslim league members stayed on in a ziaappointed 
caretaker government 
zia called wednesdays elections before he died in a plane crash 
that also killed the us ambassador and 28 other people the cause 
of the crash has not yet been determined

president reagans final budget will propose 
ending some government programs and switching to a twoyear budget 
cycle the white house said today 
spokesman marlin fitzwater declined to say what low priority 
programs are under consideration to be eliminated 
he said the budget would call for no new taxes would not 
tamper with social security and would include a defense spending 
buildup that does more than just keep up with inflation 
he said the proposal would meet the deficit reduction of the 
grammrudman deficitreduction act which would mean reductions of 
at least 32 billion to reduce the fiscal 1989 budget to 100 
billion 
fitzwater said the budget is aimed at achieving a balanced budget 
by fiscal 1993 
he said the review of agency budgets by the office of management 
and budget would be completed this week and the omb proposals would 
then be submitted to the agencies which will have a right of appeal 
from the budget office decisions before the white house takes the 
budget proposal to congress which has the final say in that it must 
appropriate money to run the government

a 10foot rocket bearing four 
experiments made a fiveminute flight today in what was touted as 
the first truly private commercial space flight 
the rocket dwarfed by larger space rockets launched here burned 
its motor for only 44 seconds as it pushed the payload container to 
an altitude of about 14000 feet or less than three miles the 
launch took place at 730 am 
the payload was later recovered from the atlantic ocean even 
though the main parachute on the rocket failed to open 
eprime aerospace co of titusville hopes the rocket loft1 
will lead to investor interest in the company so that it eventually 
can buy bigger rockets and establish a commercial launch service 
stockholders and potential investors were among the 200 people 
who watched the liftoff 
company officials admit they have a long way to go they had to 
delay the maiden launch a year to meet financial safety technical 
and government requirements 
the socalled commercialization of space to bring the 
private sector into the launching of satellites and other space 
activity has been a major goal of the reagan admininstration 
eprime paid the air force 24000 for use of an old weather 
rocket launch pad and some support services the company also had to 
buy 1 million in liability insurance to cover any damage to air 
force property 
it was the first time a privately owned rocket had been launched 
from either air force or nasa facilities here 
eprime operations director jim mizell said the experiments on 
board the flight were from paying customers he declined to say how 
much they had paid except to say that it was not enough to make the 
flight profitable he estimated the total the fledgling company has 
spent up to this point at 200000 
in trying to attract investors eprime billed the flight as the 
first truly commercial space flight but by eprimes own 
definition space starts 75 miles up and space services inc a 
commercial launch company in houston sent up a rocket six years 
ago although it did not carry commercial cargo 
though the main chute did not open during the flight mizell 
reported that the smaller parachute broke the fall and divers 
recovered the floating 30pound package about two miles offshore 
they reported it appeared to be undamaged 
loft1 which stands for launch operations flight test carried a 
biology experiment from a huntsville ala high school a thinfilm 
polymer experiment from morton thiokol inc and utah state 
university a flight monitoring system for measuring acceleration 
and temperature from qsi corp and weber state college in utah and

the nations roman catholic bishops concluded 
their annual meeting today with formal pleas for religious liberty 
in eastern europe and for the easing of a law covering legal status 
for undocumented hispanic workers in the united states 
archbishop roger mahony of los angeles said the bishops were 
challenging soviet leaders whose policies have heavy influence 
throughout eastern europe to match their recent talk of reform 
with concrete action 
despite improvements in some countries the church leaders said 
in their statement a general pattern of intolerance of religion 
remains clearly evident 
as for hispanic workers the bishops said in a separate statement 
that there is widespread discrimination in this country partly 
because employers dont understand immigration rules concerning whom 
they can or cant hire 
the bishops said they are compiling files of discrimination cases 
in hopes of persuading lawmakers to rewrite the law 
one day earlier the bishops politely but firmly told the vatican 
to go back and start over on its document questioning the authority 
of national bishops conferences such as theirs 
and far from expecting an angry reaction from rome one of the 
bishops leaders says he expects vatican officials to do as the 
american churchmen are asking 
about 100 such conferences around the world were asked to comment 
on the vatican draft and bishop james malone of youngstown ohio 
said wednesday that many of them seem to be expressing opinions 
similar to ours in response the vatican will likely work up a 
new draft he said though the bishops are not predicting what it 
might say 
the us bishops voted 20559 earlier wednesday barely meeting 
the required twothirds of the conferences 305 active members to 
reject the vatican draft 
before the vote they softened the tone of their rejection notice 
considerably but they stood firm when cardinal bernard law of 
boston and several other bishops tried to amend the response even 
further so it would merely ask for more work on the vatican draft 
rather than a new start 
half a loaf is better than none law said 
malones committee of past conference presidents was first to 
give ground withdrawing the original version of the bishops 
response on monday the first day of the church leaders annual 
meeting 
suddenly gone from the bishops proposed description of the 
vatican draft were such phrases as rigid and confusing and 
overly defensive and negative 
then wednesday by voice vote the bishops deleted these words 
non placet the draft is not suitable several bishops had 
argued that the phrase especially the formal latin was too blunt 
perhaps even offensive to the vatican 
still the final version says elsewhere we do not believe that 
the working document is suitable as a basis for discussion 
the first version had received considerable news coverage and 
some bishops have criticized the accounts as too negative 
however archbishop john roach of st paulminneapolis a member 
of malones committee said they perceived a sharpness in the 
tone of the document which i dont think we intended and helped 
spur the bishops to write a better response to the vatican 
the american bishops most controversial efforts their national 
pastoral letters taking issue with reagan administration policies on 
nuclear weapons and on treatment of the poor have won public 
praise from pope john paul ii 
however the rising prominence of such conferences has also 
brought criticism from vatican officials who note that such 
organizations are not part of the roman churchs traditional 
hierarchy 
the vatican draft declares that bishops conferences have little 
real standing that the church lodges authority in the individual 
bishops under the pope the bishop of rome 
the us bishops in their reply do not lay out a case arguing 
that the vatican is wrong rather they argue that the draft 
distorts some evidence and generally gives only one side of the 
matter 
on another topic the bishops also voted wednesday to set 
guidelines on preaching by lay men and women during catholic masses 
several bishops said the guidelines could lead to more such 
preaching but others noted that they reiterated clear strictures 
against anyone other than an ordained minister preaching the main 
sermon interpreting the gospel during mass 
retired bishop william mcmanus of fort waynesouth bend ind 
argued that the guidelines restating that implicit ban on some 
preaching by women who cannot be ordained as catholic ministers 
would be an unnecessary new source of irritation for the 
denominations women 
he offered what he described as the ridiculous possibility that a 
local church would have mother teresa as its guest but could allow 
her to speak only early in the service or at the very end leaving 
the main sermon to a male deacon parroting bible lessons he 
learned in the second grade

chancellor helmut kohl today 
indicated that washingtons demand that its nato allies shoulder a 
greater defense burden may run into widespread resentment in western 
europe 
kohl a staunch us supporter has in recent weeks been 
emphasizing that the west germans are not eager to take on greater 
financial burdens within the north atlantic treaty organization 
in a speech to the north atlantic assembly an independent body 
of lawmakers from the 16 nato nations kohl extended that message 
somewhat to include other alliance allies in western europe 
we are all agreed it is not satisfactory to busy ourselves with 
extensive account ledgers in order to prove our achievements to one 
another kohl said in the keynote speech to the assemblys plenary 
session 
i only have to mention that besides the german army more than 
400000 soldiers of our allies are stationed in this densely 
populated land kohl said 
but he added we should also not overtax one another and 
thereby conjure up the danger that acceptance of the alliance could 
be damaged 
many us officials maintain that west european nato members are 
not shouldering their fair share of the expense 
west germans argue that other kinds of national contributions to 
nato besides financial considerations should also be taken into 
account they cite as an example putting up with the noise and 
intrusiveness of military hardware and soldiers on their territory 
in his address kohl referred to the heavy burden on our people 
from lowlevel flights by nato pilots based in west germany 
kohl called for strengthening the european pillar referring 
to assembly proposals for an exclusively european division of troops 
europe cannot demand the presence of american troops if it 
cannot provide its own substantial contribution kohl said 
but he added that the security of europe also in the future 
depends decisively on the american counterbalance to the soviet 
unions military strength 
kohl called on the soviet union to orient its military presence 
in eastern europe on the needs for selfdefense and for lower 
conventionalforce levels 
he referred also to the soviet blocs drastic superiority 
in the area of nuclear shortrange weapons 
kohl said the warsaw pact and nato should include these weapons 
in future disarmament negotiations 
kohl also said he rejects removing nuclear weapons completely 
from western europe because of the continued numerical superiority 
of warsaw pact forces

detectives arrived in handcuffs at executive airport and was taken 
to the police department for questioning she ignored reporters 
questions as she crossed the tarmac 
i have not killed anyone i told you that i have not killed 
anyone the checks i cashed yes she told kcratv before landing 
in sacramento 
it was not immediately known when she would be arraigned 
puente was taken into custody after a fiveday hunt wednesday 
night by police who tracked her on a tip provided to a tv station

expected it said officer paul von lutzow 
police believe puente killed tenants of her sacramento boarding 
house for their social security benefits they have a list of two 
dozen people who are missing and who might have lived at the 
eightbedroom house at one time or another 
police tracked her to the royal viking motel on the basis of a 
tip provided to cbs by a disabled pensioner who met her in a bar and 
took a liking to her said cbs assignment editor gene silver 
von lutzow who said the woman identified herself using an alias 
donna johansen told the associated press that the man who alerted 
the news media had made a date to go shopping with her today 
during a lengthy conversation she told him she was from the 
san francisco area and he put twoandtwo together and called von 
lutzow said 
he wanted me to wait until the next day because he had a date 
with her von lutzow said

interview that he became suspicious after puente quizzed him about 
his social security benefits 
she seemed so nice and sincere she really was very 
believable willgues said adding that she also had suggested that 
they live together 
i kept looking at the woman something just didnt seem right 
i felt like i had seen her before he added explaining why he 
called the tv station 
the whitehaired puente clad in a red jacket and pink house 
dress bowed her head as officers walked her to a patrol car she 
declined to answer any reporters questions but appeared somewhat 
dazed 
puente who has a criminal record dating back to a 1948 
conviction for forging checks has been charged only with the murder 
of alvaro montoya 52 a mentally disabled transient who lived in 
the house his disappearance caused volunteers of america counselor 
judy moise to contact police leading to the diggings

walk away from the house while they dug for bodies state and 
federal authorities had been searching for her in mexico where she 
has relatives and las vegas as well as california 
one former tenant homer myers told reporters wednesday that he 
and other tenants unknowingly heled puente dispose of the bodies by 
digging the makeshift graves 
myers 74 said puente first asked him to dig a hole in the back 
yard for an apricot tree 
she said she had contacted a nursery and they told her she 
needed a hole that was four feet by four feet and five feet deep i 
thought that was a little deep now i know why 
digging was completed at the boarding house yard tuesday and 
police searched the inside of the blue house detectives removed 
several items from the house but would not say what evidence was 
found other than the seven bodies 
kearns said there has been no decision whether to dig at any 
other sites including a house several blocks away where puente 
lived several years ago 
the coroners office assisted by several forensic 
anthropologists is still in the process of identifying the bodies 
and performing autopsies to determine cause of death

bush had shrugged off repeated questions about his reported 
choice of sununu which cheered conservatives but worried some 
others including jewish lobbyists still upset with the new hampshire 
governor for being the only governor to refuse to endorse a 
proclamation attacking a 1975 un resolution that equated zionism 
with racism 
sununu who is arabamerican told reporters in concord wednesday 
he refused to sign the proclamation because he felt it was 
inappropriate for a governor to try to influence foreign 
policy 
sununu has a reputation for being a quick study highly 
intelligent and assertive some regard him as as arrogant and 
abrasive traits that could hurt him in working with congress he 
made light of that reputation wednesday when asked to describe his 
managerial skills 
i am what i am a warm charming effective manager who by the 
skills of gentle encouragement of individuals has been able to 
do a few good things for the state of new hampshire he said 
sununu had declined to run for a fourth term citing a need to 
return to the real world to get a real job sununu and his wife 
nancy have eight children he is credited with helping revive 
bushs candidacy with a win in the new hampshire primary last 
february after the vice president finished a poor third in iowas 
caucuses 
sources also said atwater was a strong contender to take over 
chairmanship of the rnc from fahrenkopf a 48yearold reno lawyer 
whose seven years in the post make him the longestserving gop chief 
in this century 
atwater 37 was a chief architect of bushs winning campaign a

the food and drug administration today proposed 
new labeling requirements for aspirin that would caution pregnant 
women against taking the popular pain reliever during the last three 
months of pregnancy because of the threat of bleeding 
it is similar to the warning already required for ibuprofen a 
pain reliever introduced in 1974 and marketed under such names as 
advil and nuprin 
the aspirin warning would say important do not take this 
product during the last three months of pregnancy unless directed by 
a doctor aspirin taken near the time of delivery may cause bleeding 
problems in both mother and child 
in a related move the agency proposed to expand a warning on 
acetaminophen products such as tylenol and anacin3 that alerts 
consumers to the need for prompt medical attention in the case of 
overdose even if there are no immediate symtoms 
the proposal published in the federal register was the first 
stage in a process that technically could drag out for about a year 
before the new labeling would be formally required 
as a practical matter however aspirin manufacturers are likely 
to start using the labeling earlier because there is little 
likelihood the requirement will not be made mandatory eventually

a boy who hailed a win by the hometown team and 
another who spoke of the quest for knowledge were among the 
first earthlings to try to reach out and touch extraterrestrial 
beings today via space phones 
using free phones set up through saturday in the atrium of atampt 
headquarters the public will have a chance to communicate with 
someone who could hear their voice long after theyre dead said 
atampt spokesman brian monahan 
about 30 hours of recorded audiovisual messages will be beamed 
to outer space by the telephone companys satellite dishes from 
thanksgiving to new years during the early morning hours when they 
arent being used for business 
among the first to send messages were students from manhattans 
clinton school whose pronouncements to the aliens ranged from the 
poignant to the silly 
i hope the quest for knowledge lasts forever said kiernan 
varas 13 a member of the young astronauts of america he explained 
later that he was concerned about the damage that drugs are doing to 
the world i hope they dont get stupid like us 
like most of the youngsters kiernan said he believed its highly 
probable that someone would see or hear his message 
if so the aliens will receive an uptodate basketball report 
from moises bermudez 13 his message i hope you saw the knicks 
versus the bullets because the knicks won 
moises said later i dont think there are ufos but maybe 
there is a life form out there but its probably used to its 
environment so how could it visit us here on earth 
monahan said atampt has 30meter dishes across the country aimed at 
communications satellites and one or two would be realigned to beam 
the radio waves 
theyre very powerful he said were gonna crank these 
up 
the messages will travel at the speed of light in a straight line 
until they run into something monahan said 
i think it appeals to the imagination the idea of hurtling 
messages at the speed of light he said and of course its 
free so if people dont get a call back they wont be upset 
the socalled space phones are not the first hightech 
attempt to communicate with possible extraterrestrials when the 
voyager spacecraft was launched in 1977 it carried a digital record 
of 118 photographs of earth 90 minutes of the worlds greatest 
music and greetings in almost 60 human languages and one whale 
language 
but what is new and exciting about this latest communication 
effort is that it is the first time nonscientists will send 
messages into space monahan said 
the messages are recorded as callers speak for 30 seconds into a 
microphone while being filmed by a television camera he said 
we thought it would be fascinating to find out what people 
would say if they had a chance to leave a message long after they 
were gone said monahan we expect to get some very serious 
thoughts on life peoples hopes possibly for the coming year but 
also for the future of the universe 
but more earthly concerns about boyfriends and girlfriends are 
also expected to be popular topics he said we will send every 
message we get wed only edit out something that might be extremely 
vulgar 
the first day of atampts call the universe program coincided 
with the opening of its newest phone center at the companys 
headquarters and the 25th anniversary of its introduction of 
pushbutton phones 
as part of todays celebration michael collins a veteran of the 
gemini and apollo space missions terry hart a mission specialist 
on a flight of the space shuttle challenger and new york mets 
pitcher ron darling were invited to appear and talk to the 
longdistance callers

thousands of albanian miners put down 
their tools and marched to the provincial capital of kosovo today to 
protest the resignations of the top two albanian leaders in the 
ethnically divided area 
the flagwaving procession swept aside a cordon of about 20 riot 
police on the outskirts of the capital pristina and ignored pleas 
by local communist officials to return to titova mitrovica 30 miles 
away 
kacusa jasari the president of kosovos communist party 
announced her resignation during a meeting to discuss personnel 
changes in the provincial leadership the staterun tanjug news 
agency said it must be approved by the party presidium 
jasari said azem vlasi will no longer be a member of kosovos 
presidium because of a recent federal decision that prohibits 
central committee members from membership in local party bodies 
tanjug said 
vlasi the former provincial party president is a member of the 
national partys central committee 
the two albanian leaders have been the main target of resignation 
demands by serbias communist party chief slobodan milosevic in 
his drive to bring kosovo under tighter serbian control 
although administratively part of serbia kosovo enjoys wide 
autonomy under the constitution adopted under the late josip broz 
tito serbs claim they are harassed by the albanian majority 
the marching miners carried pictures of tito the protest 
involving about 4000 was believed to be the largest by ethnic 
albanians since ethnic riots in 1981 left at least nine people dead 
in pristina 
the pristina meeting described as crucial by the belgrade press 
was convened after severe criticism of kosovos mostly ethnic 
albanian leadership by serbs 
despite having shown considerable initiative in her duties she 
has to bear objective responsibility for the situation in kosovo 
said a statement by kosovos leadership carried by tanjug 
jasari replaced vlasi as head of the provincial communist party 
last year 
seven kosovo leaders have stepped down in the past month 
milosevic backed by mass rallies attended by hundreds of 
thousands of serbs in recent months has blamed kosovos leadership 
for ethnic tensions in the province 
jasari said in her opening speech that the provincial leadership 
had to insist with greater determination on preventing both 
albanian and serbian nationalism in kosovo tanjug reported 
the demands for the replacement of the provincial leadership are 
based on claims they have been unable to cope with albanian 
nationalism that has allegedly been simmering since 1981

a disease that caused 127 children in a ukrainian 
town to lose their hair has been traced to high doses of thallium a 
toxic metal probably carried by acid rain a newspaper reported 
thursday 
since there are no sources of the discharge of thallium into 
the environment in chernovtsy and its environs a conclusion was 
drawn that the chemical was introduced to the area by acid rains in 
july the communist party daily pravda said 
despite the conclusion authorities are continuing to investigate 
other possible causes for the disease it reported 
a criminal investigation has been initiated pravda said 
indicating that if individuals were found to be responsible for 
thallium poisoning they may face criminal charges 
ten industrial operations have been suspended near chernovtsy on 
the soviet border with romania pravda said 
however despite the measures being taken it is reported that 
the number of cases of the disease continues to grow it said 
the disease was first reported in the soviet media nov 6 on 
wednesday the weekly literaturnaya gazeta said the cause had been 
traced to thallium but did not name the source 
thallium is a poisonous mettalic element that resembles lead as 
is used chiefly in compounds in photoelectric cells or in pesticides 
chernovtsy is far from the chernobyl nuclear power plant and the 
areas downwind of it that suffered from radiation contamination 
after a 1986 accident 
medical experts called in for the investigation were studying the 
strange selectivity of the ailment which affected mainly weakened 
children and adolescents with blue eyes and blond hair pravda 
said 
pravda said the children not only lost their hair but many 
experienced mild neurological disorders resulting in irritability

the children affected ranged in age from 5 months to 14 years 
medical experts believe the disease has no lingering effects and the 
childrens hair will grow back the reports said 
literaturnaya gazeta said most of the afflicted children had been 
taken to hospitals in major soviet cities for special attention 
however the optimistic forecast has not brought any peace of 
mind because it is still not clear where the source of infection 
is literaturnaya gazetta said 
some of the possible sources the weekly said include a romanian 
chemical plant about 40 miles from chernovtsy or fumes from gasoline 
to which tricksters have added thallium all the sick childrens 
families have cars or live in the area of garages literaturnaya 
gazetta said 
whatever version will prevail one thing is already clear it 
was the last drop which made the cup of ecological patience 
overflow the weekly said

the ultraorthodox shas political party has 
asked prime minister yitzhak shamir to create a radio station with 
exclusively religious programming a spokesman for the party said 
thursday 
we would like to bring some of the light the torah gives to the 
people said shas spokesman moshe peretz said many of our own 
people do not know the abcs of judaism because they are denied by 
the educational system 
shamirs hardline likud party has made many concessions to shas 
in order to gain the support of the religious party which controls 
six seats in the parliament or knesset chief among them was a 
promise to amend a law narrowing the definition of who is a jew 
shamir was asked to form the government by president chaim herzog 
after his party got 40 seats compared with 39 for the rival labor 
party in nov 1 elections for the 120seat parliament but 
negotiations to form a coaltion still are continuing 
the shas party which represents sephardic jews those of north 
african and arab origin also has requested the creation of a 
third separate school system to be devoted to educating orthodox 
sephardic students 
the financially strapped statefinanced school system already 
supports both secular and religious school systems 
peretz said likud has not received definite answers about the 
radio station or the school system 
the hadashot newspaper said last week that likud would transform 
israels only classical music program into a religious station 
there are three staterun radio stations and an additional station 
run by the armed forces 
the proposed radio station would broadcast courses on judaism and 
be used to counter attacks peretz charged were made routinely by the 
mainstream media 
there are journalists in israel who find it their goal in life 
to attack judaism he said we would like to bring to the people 
the right face of judaism 
the real security of israel will be in the moral fabric of the 
people we want to bring people back closer to the jewish roots to 
see the strength of the people he said

president reagan seeking to give new impetus 
to international trade negotiations announced thursday he is 
dropping a demand that other countries join the united states in 
phasing out agricultural subsidies by the year 2000 
an eventual elimination of government interventions into farm 
markets remains the american goal reagan said in a speech to the 
us chamber of commerce 
but he acknowledged that talks under the auspices of the general 
agreement on tariffs and trade have beast in part 
because of the us demand for a fixed deadline fogged down at lor getting 
governments out of the business of subsidizing their agricultural 
economies 
reagan failed at the sevennation economic summit in toronto at 
the end of may to persuade principal us trade partners to endorse 
such a timetable which has been criticized heatedly by the european 
economic community and japan 
on tuesday us trade representative clayton yeutter announced a 
new us proposal to be taken up at the midterm review of the 
uruguay round of talks under gatt the proposal called for a freeze 
on all farm price supports subsidies and trade barriers in the next 
two years but made no mention of an endofcentury deadline for 
phasing subsidies out 
noting the coming midterm review in t it is a testament to the commitment 
of our two 
governments to the principles of the open market and to economic 
cooperation 
the united states government subsidized american agriculture in 
the amount of more than 26 billion in the fiscal year that ended 
sept 30 and there has been little enthusiasm in congress for the 
administrations push to lower the governments profile in the 
farming business 
reagan said that instead of continuing to pursue agreement on a 
phaseout deadline of the year 2000 the us negotiators will be 
ready to discuss flexible adjustment procedures to cushion the 
shock of ending subsidies he said the united states would be 
flexible about timetables so long as everyone agrees on nailing 
down an adjustment plan with specific dates for ending 
tradedistorting subsidies and market access barriers the final 
goal is what is important 
reagan also said that the united states recognizes the concerns 
of many nations among the 96 that are members of gatt over the 
question of food security or the worry on the part of some 
nations that if trade barriers disappear they would be left at the 
mercy of others in the event of food shortages 
again they may have a point he said and so in montreal 
well be ready to talk about government stockpiles land purchases 
and other ways of dealing with what has been called food security 
 
on another matter reagan told his business audience that the 
us policy of seeking to open new markets for american products and 
to remove trade barriers will continue intact under presidentelect 
george bush 
in fact he said presidentelect bush has been on board every 
step of the way anyone who thinks that american policy in this area 
might shift with the new administration or the new congress is 
deluding himself 
he said he and bush would meet with yeutter and secretary of 
agriculture richard lyng to reiterate our mutual support before 
the montreal talks 
among other key objectives of us gatt negotiators in montreal 
reagan said are these 
steps to improve intellectual property protections particularly 
to attack counterfeiting and piracy 
establish rules which for the first time would cover trade in 
services as well as in goods and products 
steps to bring about greater discipline over traderelated 
investment

the willow creek dam above the eastern 
oregon town of heppner is reliable according to a review panel 
asked to look at the safety of the floodcontrol dam because of 
worry about erosion 
criticism of the dams design was without merit the fivemember 
technical panel said in its report the dam was the first in the 
nation built entirely by the rollercompacting method rather than 
the traditional method of pouring concrete 
the review was ordered by sen mark hatfield a ranking 
republican on the senate energy and water subcommittee 
in a statement issued after the panels report was released 
wednesday hatfield said the allegations of safety problems were 
quite serious but after a thorough study by army experts and 
an independent investigator it appears reasonable to assert those 
concerns were unfounded 
the 169foothigh dam was completed in 1983 at a cost of 347 
million to protect residents of heppner in 1903 one third of the 
towns population died in a flash flood of willow creek

the palestinian refugee camp of ein elhilweh on sidons southern 
outskirts but we havent been able to verify this

abduction and said winklers lebanese driver was released shortly 
afterward 
winkler took up his duties in sidon 25 miles south of beirut 
about a month ago said the police spokesman 
he said an emergency meeting was under way between palestinian 
guerrilla leaders and the command of the popular nasserite 
organization militia in sidon to try to determine winklers 
whereabouts 
the organization is a leftist sunni moslem militia that has been 
governing sidon since the 1975 outbreak of lebanons civil war 
in geneva spokesman joerg bischof said red cross delegates have 
been abducted before in the region but all were released a few hours 
later lets hope this will be again the case this time he said 
issam salem a spokesman for plo chief yasser arafat said the 
action was aimed against the recent declaration of the state of 
palestine and pledged to find the kidnappers 
they kidnappers are not going to get away with it he told 
reporters 
arafat proclaimed the birth of the palestinian state at an 
extraordinary meeting of the palestine national council the

the justice department announced today that it 
has reviewed the cases of 28 cuban detainees and has decided to send 
15 of them back to their homeland in the near future 
the 15 who came to the united states in the boatlift of 125000 
people from mariel cuba have been convicted of crimes ranging from 
burglary to firstdegree murder the justice department said in a 
statement 
the cases of the 28 were reviewed by threemember repatriation 
review panels set up at the justice department in the wake of last 
years prison riots by cuban detainees at atlanta and oakdale la 
which were triggered by an agreement with cuban president fidel 
castro to resume sending many of the detainees back to the island 
the threemember panels will undertake further review of the 
remaining 13 detainees of the group of 28 to determine whether they 
should be returned to the island or released justice department 
aides cary copeland and george calhoun told a news conference 
the 28 are the first cases to be heard by the review panels and 
are among hundreds of detainees who face repatriation reviews 
the two justice department aides declined to speculate on when 
the 15 might be sent back noting they fully expect that lawyers for 
them will file court suits 
we expect to challenge negative decisions in court arguing 
that each detainee is entitled to an administrative review by a 
federal court of the justice department decision said gary 
leshaw director of the nonprofit atlanta legal aid organization 
representing mariel detainees 
the justice department action on the 15 moves the government one 
step closer to undertaking the first deportations of mariel cubans 
to their communist homeland since may 1985 
separate justice department parole review panels were established 
in the wake of last years riots and those panels have reviewed 11 
cases to date calhoun and copeland said the panels determined that 
six detainees should remain in the custody of the immigration and 
naturalization service the other five will receive further review 
to determine if they are suitable for parole 
an agreement between rioting prisoners and the government 
provided that cuban detainees who were incarcerated at the time of 
the disturbances would receive a full fair and thorough review by 
the justice department of any ins decision denying them parole 
deportable cuban detainees are being held in a strict 
lockdown in a penitentiary in talladega ala so another 
disturbance is considered unlikely 
i think it is ironic that the us government chooses to 
continue on the unfortunate path of deporting people to a country 
that our own un ambassador has characterized as one of the 
worlds darkest dungeons leshaw said 
cuban groups in miami were already planning protests 
we will appeal to president reagan he can block the 
deportations even if the people are sitting in an airplane at the 
airport rafael penalver chairman of the task force of cuban 
american citizen organizations said wednesday 
penalver is a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement to end 
the riots by 3800 mariel detainees last november

theres nobody home in yturria texas except 
maybe a few prairie dogs and armadillos 
but its on the map along with 51 other obscure sites that have 
made the big time for the first time in the 1989 rand mcnally road 
atlas appearing this week in stores nationwide 
michael dobson director of cartographic services at rand 
mcnally based in nearby skokie says most of the towns were put on 
the map in response to travelers suggestions 
yturria 50 miles north of brownsville has no human residents 
but it was added this year because it is the site of the yturria 
ranch recognized as a historic site by texas 
yturrias on there more as a point of interest than as a 
populated place dobson said we really look at places and say 
do they have a travelconsumer related value in some cases they 
might be the only point of significance in the area 
dobson said he receives thousands of letters each year from 
travelers who suggest changes 
vermillion kan was added after he received a letter from a man 
who said the 167 mostly elderly residents of vermillion enjoyed 
looking at the atlas and planning trips both real and imaginary 
rohwer ark was added after someone wrote to note that it was 
the site of an internment camp for japaneseamericans during world 
war ii dobson said 
while dobson says he likes to add new towns when he can he is 
limited to what he can fit on the map especially in the densely 
populated northeast 
you try to make it so there arent so many things that you lose 
legibility he said 
dobson couldnt say how many towns were listed in the atlas but 
he said he doesnt often drop a town 
every once in a while the army corps of engineers will build a 
dam and a town that was in existence will be under 30 or 40 feet of 
water he said but very few people will write to say their town 
no longer exists

federal agencies probably will recommend 250 to 
400 rivers for protection in the nations wild and scenic river 
system according to a conservation group which said thursday that 
things are looking up with the accession of a fisherman to the 
white house 
the forest service has identified 500 rivers in its 123 national 
forests that are eligible for protection and expects that at a 
miniumum 200 will be included said kevin coyle of american 
rivers who said he was also speaking for george leonard associate 
chief of the forest service 
frank snell chief of the recreation wilderness and cultural 
resources division of the bureau of land management said his agency 
was studying another 60 to 80 rivers on its lands he did not say 
how many were expected to be recommended for protection 
leonards flight was delayed and he could not be at a news 
conference sponsored by american rivers a conservation group 
chiefly interested in preserving freeflowing rivers 
the wild and scenic river system was established by congress 20 
years ago to preserve freeflowing rivers from damming development 
along their banks or other harm so far only 119 segments totaling 
9200 miles have been protected of which 44 rivers and 1429 miles 
in oregon were mandated by a bill passed by congress and signed by 
president reagan last month 
the 9200 miles are only 02 percent of the total us river 
system w kent olson president of american rivers said the group 
estimates that 17 percent of the total has been dammed we are 
quite hopeful that the wild and scenic system will quadruple over 
the next 10 years he said 
in presidentelect george bush and secretary of statedesignate 
james baker we have a fisherman as president and a fisherman as 
secretary of state and things are looking up olson said 
stewart l udall interior secretary for presidents kennedy and 
johnson said he was preparing an open letter to bush that would 
say among other things if you are looking for things that dont 
cost a lot of money the wild rivers system is certainly a 
candidate 
the letter will tell bush he has the chance to preside over the 
preservation of more miles of freeflowing rivers that all of your 
predecessors combined udall said 
in 1982 the national park service identified 1524 river segments 
totaling 62000 miles as worthy of study to see if they met the 
congressionallly criterion of having outstandingly remarkable 
features olson said it might take 50 years to bring that many under 
protection 
for some years the service has been studying the idea of a 
river park protecting a river along its entire length deputy 
director denis galvin said the idea was still being considered for 
a handful two or three rivers but the service had not been 
able to put together the right factors to make the proposal 
acceptable to all jurisdictions along the lengths of the 
candidates 
he identified only one candidate the buffalo river in arkansas 
while rivers are being studied the forest service and the bureau 
of land management impose a quartermile buffer zone on each bank 
where timbering stockwatering and similar activities are banned 
but they cannot prevent the federal energy regulatory commission 
from granting licenses from small hydroelectric dams favored by 
1978 legislation aimed at diversifying energy supplies the 
commission grants about 200 licenses a year 
olson said many westerners saw protection as a river grab 
but rivers that are designated often act as an enhancer of local 
property values

solidarity leader lech walesa has aghat the date was 
acceptable to walesa but the banned union considered the 
arrangements tentative 
in another development 51 people ended a hunger strike in the 
southern city of katowice after winning the reinstatement of the 
last of about 100 miners dismissed in august for striking the 
decision clears away one of the major obstacles blocking promised 
talks between authorities and the opposition 
alfred miodowicz a member of the ruling politburo in addition to 
being leader of the official union alliance known by its polish 
initials opzz had challenged walesa to a debate tuesday in the 
communist party daily trybuna ludu 
polish radio announced the debate should take place after the 
evening news nov 30 the staterun news agency pap later carried an 
identical report 
walesa on tuesday agreed in principle for a televised debate on 
union issues 
it would be walesas first appearance on state tv since 1983 
when he challenged thendeputy prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski 
during a televised speech at the lenin shipyard in gdansk rakowski 
became polands prime minister in september 
attempts to reach walesa for comment were not successful his 
wife said he was not at his gdansk home 
solidarity spokesman robert kozak confirmed the date was 
acceptable to walesa but said the union considered it to be 
tentative he did not elaborate 
walesa earlier authorized solidarity adviser adam michnik and 
solidarity national spokesman janusz onyszkiewicz to make the 
technical arrangements but neither of them was at home late tuesday 
to answer questions 
walesa and miodowicz will face the cameras alone without any 
advisers for 45 to 60 minutes the radio report said 
miodowicz indicated the debate might be a partial substitute for 
the talks authorities promised during the august wave of strikes 
the talks were to consider the issue of union pluralism and broader 
topics of economic and political reform 
besides the fate of the dismissed miners the talks have been 
delayed by government objections to the participation of solidarity 
advisers jacek kuron and michnik 
miodowicz has headed the official unions since they were set up 
by the government in 1982 after the authorities banned solidarity 
the soviet blocs first independent trade union 
solidarity supporters demanding their union be made legal again 
believe more than one union should be allowed in each workplace 
because the opzz does not adequately represent workers 
miodowicz favors one union in one enterprise and says solidarity 
activists are welcome to join his unions and try to change them from 
within 
in katowice adam slomka a spokesman for 51 people fasting since 
saturday in the christ the king cathedral said the agreement to 
rehire dismissed workers was reached through the mediation of roman 
catholic bishop damian zimon 
we managed to achieve in five days what hadnt been achieved in 
several months said slomka speaking by telephone from the 
cathedral he said agreement was reached late wednesday with the 
national coal federation to reinstate the workers as of thursday 
workers broke their fast thursday morning eating rolls with 
butter and sweetened tea slomka said 
slomka said 49 miners who still had not been reinstated were to 
be restored to their old jobs he said only two workers at the 
stalowa wola steel mill in southeast poland another region of the 
country have not gotten back their jobs since the august strikes 
tadeusz napieracz a deputy director at the coal federation the 
body that oversees the mines confirmed the reinstatements but he 
denied they had been fired he said officials wanted to reassign 
them while the miners insisted on their jobs back

business has agreed to disband his business and pay a 600000 fine 
under a plea agreement with the justice departments antiobscenity 
unit 
the details of the governments plea agreement with avram 
freedberg and his company were filed in federal court today as part 
of a proposed settlement of freedbergs civil suit to stop his 
prosecution in more than one state 
as part of the plea agreement freedbergs company consumer 
marketing group ltd of stamford conn will be disbanded and 
forfeit its 100000 inventory of pictures and videotapes of sexual 
acts according to the court papers 
the company agreed to enter guilty pleas to obscenity charges in 
federal courts in utah mississippi and delaware and pay a 600000 
fine 
in return the government will drop 18 felony obscenity charges 
against freedberg in utah where he was indicted earlier this year 
along with his company 
remaining criminal charges pending against the company in utah 
will also be dismissed in return for the firms guilty plea to one 
count of mailing or transporting obscene material according to the 
indictment 
freedberg also agreed to cooperate with the governments 
continuing investigation of pornography distributors including 
giving grand jury testimony 
details of the plea agreement were filed in court as part of an 
outofcourt settlement of freedbergs lawsuit to prevent his 
indictment in more than one state 
on june 8 us district judge thomas penfield jackson issued a 
preliminary injunction barring the justice department from bringing 
criminal charges against freedberg and his company in more than one 
federal court jurisdiction 
the department had planned to charge freedberg in utah 
mississippi delaware and indiana 
but jackson had ruled that the justice departments decision to 
prosecute freedberg in more than one jurisdiction raised 
constitutional questions 
freedberg and his company had contended that the governments 
strategy was unlawfully and unconstitutionally preventing 
plaintiffs from engaging in a legal occupation 
as part of the proposed settlement which jackson is expected to 
approve the injunction will be dissolved and freedbergs civil 
lawsuit against the justice department will be dismissed 
in the settlement document submitted to jackson the justice 
department said it continues to deny its multidistrict 
prosecution policy is unconstitutional or contrary to law

local civil rights leaders have accused 
illinois central college officials of racism in bypassing a black 
fulbright scholar and selecting a white man with less experience as 
its new president 
local naacp officals said wednesday they believe racial prejudice 
influenced the appointment last week of thomas k thomas who has 
been president of red rocks community college in lakewood colo 
since march 1987 
the black candidate is a fulbright scholar studied at harvard 
and has 20 years experience as a college president the white 
candidate has 20 months experience as a college president said 
john gwynn jr state and local president of the national 
association for the advancement of colored people it was just so 
obvious the black candidate was so much more qualified 
trustees at the college voted 52 to appoint thomas 47 rather 
than abel b sykes jr 54 president at kings river community 
college in reedley calif for 15 years 
the peoria naacp called for the decision to be overturned and 
filed complaints with the illinois board of higher education the 
illinois board of education and the illinois department of human 
rights state officials said they would investigate 
some trustees defended the appointment 
racism was not an issue in the selection said douglas 
stewart chairman of the colleges board of trustees i think we 
had three qualified candidates provided by the search committee we 
chose one of them 
the lone black board member louis owens disagreed 
if sykes was white there is no question that he would have 
been chosen owens said whats worse had i not been on the 
search committee dr sykes name would have never come up im 
disappointed and devastated 
owens was board chairman but was removed from that position after 
the vote on thomas owens said board members told him he was ousted 
because they felt he could not support the new president 
the twoyear college serves 12000 students in eight counties 
surrounding peoria

housing construction in october posted the 
biggest increase in eight months the government said thursday in a 
report taken as evidence that the federal reserve hasnt yet curbed 
excessive economic growth 
the commerce department said construction began on new homes and 
apartments at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 155 million 
units last month up 72 percent from september it was the highest 
level since april and the sharpest increase since february 
this is yet one more sign that our economy is doing very 
well said lyle gramley a former federal reserve governor now 
chief economist of the mortgage bankers association of america 
the consumer is very confident there are a lot of jobs 
available weve had some instability in the financial markets 
but nothing to worry the consumer excessively he said 
a month ago most economists were saying the federal reserves 
program of pushing up interest rates since late march was beginning 
to take hold slowing economic growth to a pace considered 
sustainable without inflation 
but starting nov 4 with the release of the labor departments 
report on october employment most signs have pointed to renewed 
vigor in the economy suggesting the federal reserve may push 
interest rates up another notch to dampen growth 
the unemployment rate last month was at a 14year low retail 
sales registered their sharpest increase in eight months and the 
operating rate at factories mines and utilities hit an 8year 
high exports in september climbed to a new record 
however excessive economic strength can be too much of a good 
thing straining manufacturers ability to produce leading to 
shortages of goods and higher prices the goal of the federal 
reserve is to check the growth through higher interest rates without 
choking it off completely 
the fed tightening since march hasnt taken a heck of a lot of 
steam out of the economy said david seiders chief economist of 
the national association of home builders and a former federal 
reserve staff member 
he predicted a hike in the discount rate the interest the fed 
charges member banks for loans by the end of the year 
we know the fed will do whatever it takes to slow the economy 
down and that means slowing the housing sector down so were a 
little worried about the future he said 
the big gain in housing starts last month followed two declines 
08 percent in september and a 11 percent in august 
although the october number was strong economists noted that the 
biggest part of the increase was concentrated in the west where the 
california market is booming they also said a temporary decline in 
mortgage interest rates of more than half a percentage point between 
midaugust and early november bolstered activity 
what were seeing is primarily a western phenomenon said 
mark obrinsky an economist with the us league of savings 
institutions i think in retrospect well see this as a little 
bit of a spike we may see this pace for another month or so but we 
surely wont see it for another six months 
excluding the west where the robust economy and population 
growth of california dominate the statistics the overall increase 
would have been a more moderate 39 percent 
housing starts shot up 15 percent in the west to 498000 units 
the highest level since december 1986 starts rose 76 percent in 
the midwest to 268000 units climbed 46 percent in the south to 
586000 units and fell 24 percent in the northeast to 202000 
for the first 10 months of the year housing starts were running 
96 percent behind the same period of 1987 the peak year for 
housing construction during the current economic expansion was 1986 
when 181 million units were started starts fell to 162 million 
last year and are expected to hit 145 million this year 
michael sumichrast a private real estate economist in 
washington said rising interest rates and high home prices likely 
will push starts down even further to about 135 million units next 
year 
singlefamily homes in october were built at an annual rate of 
115 million units up 100 percent following a 33 percent decline 
a month earlier 
apartment construction was up a scant 02 percent to 408000 
units in october after rising 63 percent in september 
building permits a good indicator of future housing activity 
shot up 74 percent in october to an annual rate of 150 million 
units the highest since september 1987 permits had fallen 48 
percent a month earlier

the wife of israeli premier yitzhak shamir 
met thursday with bulgarian leader todor zhivkov and another 
bulgarian official said diplomatic ties with israel would be resumed 
once unspecified hindrances are gone 
shulamit shamir who was born in bulgaria but left at age 17 in 
1941 held no substantive talks with zhivkov according to bulgarian 
officials at the meeting in zhivkovs official residence 
western journalists were excluded from the meeting which also 
was attended by some participants in a twoday conference examining 
bulgarias role in saving 50000 jews from the nazis 
when that conference ended thursday bulgarian host stefan 
petrov head of the government news agency sofia press was asked 
whether the symposium the first of its kind in communist 
bulgarias history might help to restore ties with israel 
diplomatic relations will be established after hindrances are 
removed petrov told an israeli journalist at a news conference 
he did not say what the hindrances were 
bulgaria and all soviet bloc nations except romania severed 
diplomatic relations with israel over the 1967 middle east war 
the symposium on bulgarias rescue of jews brought together 
jewish leaders from israel the united states france austria east 
germany and hungary for the first time on bulgarian soil 
the soviet union poland hungary and east germany recently have 
moved to improve relations with international jewish communities and 
with israel czechoslovakia has said it will hold a conference on 
the middle east that officials say will include former israeli 
foreign minister abba eban 
serge kwajgenbaum secretary general of the european jewish 
congress said he met for 45 minutes with zhivkov on thursday and 
detected bulgarian willingness to improve ties to jewish communities 
around the world 
zhivkov invited the president of the world jewish congress edgar 
bronfman to visit bulgaria as soon as possible kwajgenbaum said 
he indicated however that full diplomatic ties between bulgaria 
and israel would not be restored before moscow takes the same action 
bulgaria has a tiny jewish community of about 3000 in 1943 
when the nazis allied to the bulgarian government tried to deport 
50000 jews to death camps in poland political and popular protests 
and a turn against german fortunes in the war foiled the plan most 
of the jews eventually emigrated to israel after the war

the west german government today paid 198 million 
the highest price ever for a modern literary treasure for the 
handwritten manuscript of franz kafkas novel the trial 
the amount paid for the manuscript which came from an 
unidentified seller eclipsed the 605000 paid in new york last 
year for kafkas letters to his fiancee felice bauer 
the buyer was a west german antiquarian bookseller heribert 
tenschert who said he was contacted by west german government 
authorities to buy the manuscript for the marbach literary institute 
near stuttgart 
it was really surprising the price he said i would have 
bought it for myself 
the bidding lasted only one minute starting at 720000 dollars 
and rising in 90000 increments against one other unidentified 
bidder 
the selling price was 18 million but sothebys the auction 
house adds a 10 percent commission to the price 
the 316page germanlanguage manuscript was finished in 1920 and 
published in 1925 a year after kafka a germanspeaking 
czechoslovak jew died of tuberculosis at age 41 
the novel has become a symbol of the 20th century alienation 
totalitarianism and choking bureaucracy the hero joseph k who 
has done nothing wrong is arrested tried and executed without ever 
being informed of his charges 
kafka instructed his literary executor max brod to burn his 
works but brod ignored the order 
kafka only wrote two other novels the castle and the 
unfinished amerika his short story the metamorphosis is 
another modern classic 
the previous record for a purely literary work was 370000 paid 
in july 1985 for a notebook of poetry and prose by the irish writer

sen john warner rva said thursday that 
meeting health and safety concerns should be a main component in the 
decision on whether to keep open a virginia plant that makes 
absolutely critical components for rocket nozzles 
it is essential to our national security to keep this plant 
operating providing we can meet the health and safety concerns of 
the people in the immediate area warner said after headingg a 
meeting between the federal and state agencies concerned with the 
avtex fiber inc plant in front royal va 
the closeddoor meeting was intended to trade information about 
the situation among the various agencies warner said 
nasa and the pentagon want avtex to stay in business because the 
plant is the only supplier for a carbonizable rayon fiber which is a 
key component of rocket nozzles for the space shuttle and some of 
the air forces nucleartipped weapons 
but the environmental protection agency and the virginia attorney 
generals office want avtex to clean up the plant that has a history 
of environmental and worker safety problems 
on oct 31 avtex chairman john gregg announced he would close 
the front royal plant because of environmental regulations and 
foreign competition for other textile products made by avtex gregg 
stopped production nov 3 but recalled the work force one week 
later as the government began a bailout of avtex 
last week nasa gave avtex 7 million for the rights to the 
fiber the space agency said it will sign an 11 million contract 
for the fiber if avtex can show by friday it will generate enough 
contracts to keep the plant in business 
warner noted that only three or four percent of the avtexs 
production involves the nozzle materials 
but he said it would require as much as two years to develop 
another source for this material in the meantime us national 
security could be harmed if missiles couldnt be launched he said 
one example he gave was the use of air force missiles to launch 
reconnaissance satellites 
one major concern warner said is to make sure that any federal 
bailout money is not used to pay off any fines which could be levied 
against avtex

british prime minister margaret thatcher said 
today the acceptance by the plo parliamentinexile of two key 
united nations resolutions on the middle east is a modest step 
forward on which progress toward peace could be made 
at a news conference shortly before ending her twoday visit 
here mrs thatcher offered a slightly more upbeat assessment of the 
declaration by the palestine national council the legislative arm 
of the palestine liberation organization than has the reagan 
administration 
she criticized the pnc for proclaiming the establishment of a 
palestinian state and said the declaration did not go far enough in 
repudiating terrorism 
obviously there are a lot of things in it that none of us 
like she said 
but she said that approval of un resolutions 242 and 338 is a 
modest step forward and something on which you could build the 
resolutions call for israeli withdrawal from occupied territories 
and assert the right of all countries to live within secure borders 
mrs thatcher added that strenuous efforts should be made to 
get peace negotiations going in the middle east 
mrs thatcher reaffirmed her high regard for presidentelect 
george bush citing his extensive experience in government as a 
major asset 
you will have a president who doesnt have to be briefed she 
said 
earlier she said she had not the slightest shadow of a doubt 
that bush will deal responsibly with the us deficit 
mrs thatcher repeated similar expressions of confidence in bush 
and the us economy in three network television interviews prior to 
meeting with the vice president for breakfast the meeting followed 
an evening of reminiscing at a state dinner with president reagan 
whom she described as a marvelous president 
i have not the slightest shadow of doubt that in good time the 
deficit will be considered in a responsible way mrs thatcher 
said in an interview on cbs this morning 
i dont share concerns about george bushs ability to deal with 
fundamental problems she said on abctvs good morning 
america i think he will deal with them in his own time and in 
his own way and very responsibly indeed 
on nbctvs today show mrs thatcher said bush and his 
advisers will need time to come up with policies for dealing with 
the deficit i dont think we should hurry them she said 
when mrs thatcher arrived at the vice presidents residence for 
her meeting with bush he greeted her as the star of good morning 
america 
the prime minister said in the interviews all broadcast live 
from blair house that she and bush were talking about the world 
economy the middle east and eastwest ties 
mrs thatcher who was ending her twoday state visit this 
afternoon after a news conference said wednesday that the western 
alliance is very fortunate to have bush as reagans successor 
for the first time we will have continuity of policies 
stretching over a second presidency and that brings enormous 
stability and confidence to the feeling of the world she told 
reporters as she sat next to reagan during an oval office photo 
session 
mrs thatcher also has said of bush we know him as a friend 
we admire him as a man of unrivaled experience and we respect him 
because he stands for all that is best in america 
after a private meeting between reagan and mrs thatcher bush 
joined a subsequent meeting attended by top officials of both 
governments like most others in the room bush said little 
deferring to the president and the prime minister who met in their 
respective capacities for the last time 
despite signs that bush and mrs thatcher will be able to work 
well together bush will have a difficult time matching the 
partnership reagan forged with the british leader 
the white house arrival ceremony for mrs thatcher on wednesday 
was filled with expressions of mutual admiration 
together our nations have faced the challenges of our time and 
have not flinched we forged ahead with strengthening the peace 
spreading prosperity and safeguarding liberty mrs thatcher said 
reagan lauded mrs thatcher for her extraordinary role in the 
revitalization of freedom and said she has contributed to a 
remarkable change in her country through policies that encourage 
individual creativity 
looking beyond his own term of office reagan added it is 
profoundly reassuring to me and to all who care about freedom that 
you will continue to share with america your vision and your steady 
hand

america is shortchanging half its young adults 
by treating those who dont attend college as failures and offering 
them little help starting careers and families according to a 
report released thursday 
the study of 16 to24yearolds by the private commission on 
youth and americas future found that young people who lack college 
training are far more constrained than were their peers of 15 
years ago because of shrinking economic prospects 
for those without a college degree there are fewer jobs with a 
future real earnings are declining faster unemployment is more 
likely and marriage is often postponed because of financial 
pressures it said 
the study refers to the nations 20 million noncollegebound 
youth as the forgotten half of their generation many of whom 
never will overcome unemployment parttime jobs with few benefits 
and povertylevel wages 
too often we think of the forgotten half as failures as 
secondrate simply because they do not attend college said 
harold howe ii a former us commissioner of education who headed 
the 19member commission they must be viewed as our hope for the 
future rather than as a generation of misfits 
howe said at a news conference that the highest priority in 
helping more young adults succeed should be to strengthen existing 
programs to keep youngsters on the right track such as head start 
and the job corps the commission recommended a 5 billion a year 
increase in federal financing for such projects 
the commission established by the william t grant foundation 
and made up of people from business labor government education 
and health and human services also recommended 
creation of a fiveyear 125 billion federally financed 
staterun national demonstration project to improve access to 
education and training through financial aid counseling and 
academic support 
more community programs emphasizing service and leadership to 
help young people get involved in civic activities thereby building 
selfrespect and keeping them away from drugs and other trouble 
expanded education training and employment programs by 
businesses and local governments that are targeted to young people 
programs to strengthen adultyouth relationships in families 
including policies at schools and businesses that take into account 
the demands placed on working parents 
the report said the school reform movement of the 1980s has 
focused too heavily on the collegebound and that financial support 
for those students far outweighs what is available to those who 
dont continue their education 
college students typically can expect publicprivate subsidies of 
5000 per school year through scholarships grants and loans while 
only about 5 percent of eligible noncollegebound youth receive 
federal job training assistance totaling 18002300 over about 
four months it said 
daniel yankelovich a member of the commission and president of 
the yankelovich group in new york city said the relatively low 
jobless rates of recent years mask the problem of high unemployment 
and underemployment among young adults 
under those statistics is a festering problem that looks like 
its going to get worse and that merits the countrys attention in a 
way that is almost impossible to exaggerate yankelovich said 
the 1990s if something isnt done about this will result in a 
tremendous amount of social unrest 
another commission member rev theodore m hesburgh president 
emeritus of notre dame said the 208page report was full of 
hopelessness but that its account of volunteers who havent given 
up on disadvantaged young people provides hope in what is 
otherwise a dismal picture

the government thursday imposed 
its first ban on a rightwing extremist group and the expoliceman 
whose deadly shooting spree prompted the crackdown was sent to a 
mental hospital for tests 
law and order minister adriaan vlok banned the white liberation 
movement a small white supremacist group invoking the same 
emergency regulations that have been used against black 
antiapartheid organizations 
barend strydom the 23yearold gunman who killed six blacks in 
pretoria on tuesday has not been linked to the white liberation 
movement but belongs to the neonazi afrikaner resistance movement 
a much larger more influential group vlok who promised a broad 
crackdown on rightwing extremists because of the rampage did not 
explain why only the smaller group was banned 
strydom who quit the national police force in february while 
facing misconduct charges was arraigned thursday in pretoria on 
charges of murdering six blacks and wounding 17 witnesses said he 
laughed as he walked through the heart of the capital city tuesday 
shooting his victims from close range with an automatic pistol 
dr willem pieterse a courtappointed psychiatrist said strydom 
showed symptoms of being a psychopath and had expressed pride in 
what he had done 
strydom who smiled throughout the hearing was sent to 
weskoppies hospital for 30 days of observation and ordered to 
reappear in court dec 19 
police said they were investigating the possibility strydom was 
involved in an incident nov 8 in which a black woman was shot to 
death at a squatter camp south of johannesburg 
the white liberation movement was formed in 1985 but did not come 
to public notice until 1987 its leader johan schabort said it had 
more than 1000 members but many more sympathizers 
aside from a few rallies and an attempt to march through a 
multiracial area last year little has been heard from the 
organization 
schabort a biochemist was issued with restrictions thursday 
confining him to the area around his hometown of brits and barring 
him from addressing more than 10 people at a time 
he said the governments action reduced the outlet for 
frustration of white south africans now we cannot control people 
who are worried about their race survival some of them could 
organize underground 
schaborts group has called for expulsion of all jewish and 
indian south africans and the removal of all blacks from white urban 
centers including the clearing out of soweto where 25 million 
blacks live near johannesburg 
schabort said he blamed the government for tuesdays rampage 
whites are living under tremendous pressure and are being 
undermined by blacks he said many whites are also working 
under tremendous pressure especially in the police force 
members of the national police force are prohibited from 
belonging to the afrikaner resistance movement but observers 
believe many officers have links or sympathies with the group 
members of the resistance movement frequently dress in khaki 
uniforms and wear swastikatype emblems and weapons the groups 
leader eugene terreblanche says whites should fight any attempt by 
the government to share political power with blacks 
strydom who wore a khaki outfit at his arraignment said he 
rejected the courts authority 
speaking in afrikaans strydom told the court if communists 
such as anglican archbishop desmond tutu and former ambassador to 
the united kingdom denis worrall are arrested then i will 
cooperate i do not have any interest in appearing before this court 
under the current state of government 
strydom frequently turned to wave at his family in the courtroom 
which was packed and guarded by policemen with shotguns in an 
unusual move photographers were allowed inside 
strydoms mother raised her fist and said strength in 
afrikaans 
since feb 23 antiapartheid organizations have been banned 
government critics have asked why rightwing white organizations 
that appear to espouse violence are not banned

a federal judge fined orkin exterminating co 
500000 for a fumigation that killed a couple and he said safety 
practices at the nations biggest pestcontrol service were 
scary in their laxity 
judge james turk convicted orkin in august of failing to monitor 
the air before letting hubert and freida watson back into their 
galax home in 1986 
turk on wednesday imposed the maximum fine but said orkin will 
have to pay only 350000 if it stays out of trouble during two 
years of corporate probation 
turk also said officers of the company must perform 2000 hours 
of community service the corporation was the only defendant in the 
case 
its nothing short of scary the way the company was handling 
its business he said 
relatives of the victims declined comment as they left the 
courtroom 
testimony indicated orkin not only failed to monitor the air 
after fumigating the watsons home but also did not remove a 
waterproof mattress cover on their bed 
assistant us attorney richard pierce said poisonous gas seeped 
into the mattress until the watsons went to bed and their movements 
released the gas 
that was a tomb sealed up waiting for the occupants to enter 
and lay down and die pierce said 
watson 73 and his 65yearold wife died days later experts 
said they were killed by vikane used to exterminate woodboring 
insects 
orkin president bob mercer took the stand and said he had 
improved training since he took over the company in february i 
recognize there was a failure to carry out orkins policy and 
procedures in the watson case mercer said 
turk said he was appalled at testimony from past and present 
orkin employees who descibed a lack of compliance with safety 
requirements and a lack of knowledge about them as well 
its almost a miracle that something like this didnt happen 
before turk said 
ronald dean mullins who supervised the watson fumigation and 
dozens of others testified that he never bothered to read the fine 
print on vikane labels 
orkins president and attorneys had no comment after sentencing 
orkin spokeswoman judy donner said from the atlanta headquarters 
that orkin was disappointed with the sentence but wants to express 
sympathy to the watson family for the loss 
orkin reached an undisclosed settlement with the watson estate 
two months ago

folk singer arlo guthrie said he intends 
to release what he calls a new and improved version of alices 
restaurant as soon as he finds ideal recording conditions 
its just a matter of getting the right recording of the right 
timing of the right audience on the right night guthrie said 
the antiwar ballad of the vietnam era tells of the 41yearold 
songwriters thanksgiving day arrest for littering 
the song has been updated with guthries comments on historical 
events since the 1965 arrest that kept him out of the draft because 
of his conviction on the littering charge said sharon palma 
manager of guthries label rising son records 
the funniest is that he hints at the coincidence that the only 
things that are 18 minutes and 20 seconds long are the song and the 
erased nixon tapes palma said thursday from the folk singers 
studio in this small bershires hills town 
the song should be rerecorded soon but with him you can never

assailants hurled bombs at a public 
meeting and into a video store thursday and police opened fire to 
disperse antigovernment protesters during ethnic unrest that killed 
at least 17 people officials said 
one person was killed and 10 were injured when police opened fire 
to break up an antigovernment demonstration in the northcentral 
kurunegala district a government communique said 
in colombo sinhalese radicals threw bombs at a meeting being 
addressed by ossie abeygoonasekara one of the three candidates for 
next months presidential elections police said 
at least 40 people suffered minor injuries in the attack and an 
ensuing stampede said officials who were not identified in 
accordance with briefing rules 
military officials said three people were killed and one was 
injured when a bomb was thrown at a video center just south of 
colombo 
they said the video center was attacked because it stayed open 
last week when the peoples liberation front a militant sinhalese 
group called for an antigovernment strike 
the victims were shop employees 
at least 13 people were killed by radical sinhalese in the south 
and center of the island and three sinhalese men were shot and 
killed by tamil rebels in the northeast said police and military 
officials 
the attacks occurred wednesday and thursday officials said among 
the victims were four government supporters a bus driver a school 
principal two employees of the colombo port a civilian clerk and 
his nephew 
the port employees were involved in compiling lists of employees 
names so police could escort them to work during a strike at the 
port last week sources said 
the military officials gave no reasons for the other killings 
but the victims were believed to be sinhalese who defied the strike 
sinhalese militants are agitating for the resignation of 
president junius r jayewardene himself a sinhalese they are 
opposed to an accord jayewardene signed that is aimed at ending 
tamil rebels fiveyear war for autonomy 
sinhalese radicals say the accord signed july 29 1987 makes 
too many concessions to the minority tamils who comprise 18 percent 
of the 16 million population 
the main tamil rebel group the liberation tigers of tamil eelam 
has refused to accept the accord saying it does not go far enough 
the peoples liberation front stepped up its antigovernment 
campaign last week and called for a fourday strike in the south 
which crippled business in the sinhalese heartland and caused food 
and gasoline shortages 
jayewardene hit back by ordering troops to open fire at 
antigovernment demonstrations and decreeing the death penalty for 
anyone convicted of instigating strikes 
jayewardene is to leave office in january and elections to choose 
his successor are scheduled dec 19 the front says he should resign 
immediately 
the group called for a boycott of the elections and has 
threatened to kill all the candidates

government support of the arts is needed to 
supplement private giving a presidential committee told president 
reagan on thursday after a sixyear study 
the committee created by a presidential executive order in 1982 
presented its report to reagan at a meeting in the roosevelt room of 
the white house 
the committee noted that during the 1980s there has been a 
diminution of tax incentives for charitable giving and warned that 
reduced incentives can damage the vitality of american 
philanthropy 
the main vehicle for support of the arts and humanities remains 
private monies a resource that must be encouraged and increased 
the report said we firmly believe government support is 
necessary however for it seems clear that the culture of this 
country cannot be sustained solely by private funding 
the federal government currently provides support for the arts 
through the national foundation on the arts and the humanities and 
the institute of museum services which have combined current 
budgets of 3301 million 
the report called for the creation of a presidential commission 
made up of both leading private citizens and government officials 
there should be sufficient annual appropriations to sustain the 
federal governments capacity as grantor innovative leadership to 
inspire its role as catalyst and continued incentives through the 
tax system to encourage private giving the committee said 
it said private giving to the arts and humanities has grown at a 
greater rate than inflation since 1980 but the two major tax 
revisions passed during the reagan administration resulted in 
reduced incentives for charitable contributions 
the 35member committee was made up of leaders of business 
government and the arts under the chairmanship of andrew heiskell 
retired chairman of time inc 
it held meetings throughout the united states and made a 
recommendation in 1984 that led to establishment of the national 
medal of arts presented annually by the president 
executive director diane j paton said the committee operated on 
an annual budget of about 300000

the nations roman catholic bishops said 
thursday the us government could help fight sustained and 
comprehensive religious persecution in the soviet bloc by linking 
that issue to others the soviets care about 
in a lengthy document the bishops detailed what they saw as 
religious intolerance and discrimination in the nations of eastern 
europe but they also suggested the time may be right to win 
improvement 
they said soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs stated policies of 
openness and restructuring offer potentially significant changes 
in thought and practice and deserve to be taken seriously and 
encouraged as a potential basis for gradual expansion of 
freedoms 
the us government should consider the possibility of using 
affirmative measures to influence human rights policies and 
practices including developing closer relations extending credits 
and encouraging cultural and educational exchanges and tourism 
the bishops said 
in all such initiatives us diplomacy should make it clear 
that continued improvement in relations will depend in part on 
continued improvement with regard to religious liberty and human 
rights 
the statement was approved on the last day of the annual meeting 
of the national conference of catholic bishops 
earlier thursday on a matter closer to home the church leaders 
called for changes in a 1986 federal law covering legalization of 
illegal aliens many of whom are catholic hispanics 
they said more hispanics should be allowed to stay in this 
country legally and they complained in particular that the laws 
provisions on penalties for employers who hire undocumented workers 
are poorly understood and lead to discrimination against hispanic 
workers in general 
the two new statements backed up the declaration earlier this 
week by the conferences president archbishop john l may of st 
louis that the bishops would continue to speak out on controversial 
public issues despite criticism 
the bishops leaders of the nations largest religious 
denomination with more than 53 million members spent much of the 
week concentrating on an intrachurch dispute with the vatican they 
rejected a romeprepared draft document that questioned the 
authority of their conference and others like it 
however may continued to play down talk of any major 
confrontation 
i dont look on these discussions as a tugofwar or an ongoing 
fight or crisis or any of these words that are used he said at a 
news conference after the meeting ended wednesday 
we are in a most serene time may said adding that pope john 
paul ii had spoken favorably of the us church during american 
bishops visits to rome this year 
the bishops appeared solidly united in loud voice votes favoring 
the new statements on religion in eastern europe and on treatment of 
hispanic immigrants in the united states 
archbishop roger mahony of los angeles said the bishops were 
challenging soviet leaders whose policies have heavy influence 
throughout eastern europe to match their recent talk of reform 
with concrete action 
despite improvements in some countries the church leaders said 
in their statement the scale of persecution has been and remains 
sustained and comprehensive and its roster of victims all 
inclusive catholics protestants orthodox jews muslims 
jehovahs witnesses and many others 
although church attendance is sometimes allowed religiously 
active people are often subject to discrimination in other areas 
the bishops said 
concerning hispanics the church leaders said many employers 
dont understand the immigration laws provisions and thus fire or 
refuse to hire many eligible hispanics out of fear of being raided 
and fined by the government 
the bishops called for action on three fronts compiling detailed 
records of discrimination to force congress to change the law 
promoting legislation to provide legalization opportunities to more 
recent immigrants and educating employers on provisions of the 
current law

corner bistros overflowed with bon vivants and 
parties sprouted in the most unlikely places as parisians celebrated 
the arrival of the new beaujolais joining other wine lovers 
worldwide 
commuters rushing through the gare de lyon railway station at 7 
am were offered a beaujolais breakfast poured from a special 
highspeed train that carried cases of the wine to the capital a 
huge crowd of happy commuters gathered around the railway car 
flowing with beaujolais primeur the first wine produced from 
the autumn harvest 
jeanpierre benoit a grower pouring wine at the train took a 
few sips of the juicy beaujolais nouveau himself before moving on to 
the next official party scheduled for 11 am 
wine drinking is a habit with people in beaujolais he said 
i can go to 10 wine tastings and never get drunk at least i 
hope so 
benoit hurried from the station to a sound stage at pathe cinema 
in montmartre where a reconstructed beaujolais village served as the 
setting for an elaborate tasting attended by about 500 journalists 
and friends of the beaujolais wine growers association 
this wine is completely different from last years much more 
of a gamay taste said michel deflache who produces wine on land 
owned by his family since 1550 and also serves as spokesman for the 
beaujolais wine growers association 
deflache poured glasses of wine under a plastic cherry tree on 
the towns quaint main street across from an oldfashioned pharmacy 
this years beaujolais is generous in the mouth more 
fullbodied it is a more masculine wine deflache said 
across town at le val dor wine bar off the champs elysees owner 
geraud rongier was quickly emptying two 220liter barrels this 
year its good very light very perfumed rongier said 
le figaro newspaper described this years batch as more 
nuanced more subtle more traditional than last years which was 
said to have an aftertaste of bananas 
wine growers say the 1988 vintage has had the advantage of being 
one of the earliest harvests in a long while the harvest sept 10 
compared with sept 22 last year gave producers a longer time to 
make the wine which is meant to be consumed quickly but benefits 
from a few weeks in the bottle 
not all frenchmen are seduced by the hype and extravagant 
tastings and remind the unwary foreigner that the new beaujolais 
once was regarded as cheap table wine 
i never drank the stuff before all this started and i still 
dont growled one seasoned customer in a bar thursday morning 
two decades of clever marketing have paid off and more than half 
of this years estimated 50 million bottles of new beaujolais will 
be exported 
since monday jets trucks and trains have been delivering the 
wine to farflung bon vivants some of whom beat parisians to the 
first sip 
australians claimed they were the first popping corks on the 
simple fruity wine 11 hours ahead of the french because of the 
difference in time zones 
japanese wine lovers held parties at restaurants about 8 hours 
before the french officials at suntory ltd a major japanese 
distiller and importer said overall japanese imports will total 
153000 cases an increase of 70 percent over last year 
the wine which sells for about 330 a bottle here will cost 
the equivalent of 42 a bottle in tokyo restaurants according to 
wine officials in beaujolais 
although japan is the fastest growing market for the new wine 
which accounts for 55 percent of the total beaujolais crop it is 
not the biggest market west germany britain and switzerland 
combined drink 60 percent of the exported beaujolais nouveau 
the us market represents about 10 percent of the new beaujolais 
sales and celebrations were planned for thursday in new york san 
francisco los angeles dallas atlanta and pittsburgh 
about 500 people were expected at a beaujolais soiree sponsored 
by the french embassy in san salvador deflache said 
there are always new markets for this uncomplicated wine he 
said and everyone likes an occasion to party

officials from south korea and north 
korea made progress thursday in efforts to hold parliamentary talks 
on peace measures on the peninsula including a declaration of 
nonaggression 
the progress raised hopes that the rival states would be able to 
begin major political negotiations next year 
there was big progress today and i myself was surprised at 
it chief south korean delegatge park joonkyu said after the 
meeting at this truce village of panmunjom 35 miles north of seoul 
parks north korean counterpart chon kum chol also noted the 
progress and said the meeting achieved progress and i hope we 
would be able to come to a complete agreement before the end of this 
year 
park heading the fivemember south korean team said the two 
sides could solve all pending issues including an agenda when they 
meet for a seventh round of talks at this village dec 15 
the progress came as a surprise because all past talks on the 
subject ended in deadlock with neither side willing to make major 
concessions the last meeting here on oct 13 broke up over basic 
and procedural matters 
the meeting thursday was the sixth session since midaugust on 
trying to set the terms for fullscale talks between the two 
nations parliaments on nonaggression economic and humanitarian 
negotiations 
the meeting made a headway when north korea surprisingly accepted 
most of earlier south korean proposals on the format of reduced main 
talks and other procedural matters 
at the start of the meeting the two sides quickly agreed the 
full legislatures of each side would attend the start of the 
negotiations in the north korean capital of pyongyang 
north korea proposed actual talks should be handled by 100 
delegates from each side while the south said 20 from each side 
would be more pradctical 
north korea revised its figure to 50 which south korea finally 
accepted the north koreans also made some procedural changes 
prompting south korean delegates to delcare that they would be able 
to travel to the northern capital next spring to begin main 
negotiations 
i am very much hopeful that we can go to pyongyang when the ice 
on the daedong river breaks said park the senior south korean 
delegate referring to the river that flows through pyongyang 
park also expressed optimism that the two koreas would be able to 
agree on an agenda at the next meeting a threepoint agenda 
proposed by south korea called for multilateral personnel and 
material exchanges the declaration of nonaggression and summit 
talks 
south korea originally had sought to sign a nonaggression pact 
but had to agree to a north korean proposal for a nonaggression 
declaration pyongyang maintains the two koreas cannot conclude a 
nonaggression pact because they are one nation not two separate 
states 
despite parks optimism his north korean counterpart told a news 
conference after the meeting that the nonaggression declaration 
should consider the removal of the 42000 us troops in south korea 
and nuclear weapons in their arsenal 
south korean officials suspect the communist north would try to 
use fullscale talks to gain withdrawal of us forces from the 
south south korea sees us troops as vital to its defense and the 
issue would stalemate any nonaggression talks 
the nations have hundreds of thousands of troops poised along 
their 150mile border they have clashed repeatedly since the korean 
war ended in 1953 they have no formal ties and the border is sealed 
talks between south and north korea have been on and off since 
the early 1970s but no significant progress has been made

benazir bhuttos populist party defeated 
the right wing in the first free election since a coup ousted her 
father 11 years ago and she expressed confidence thursday that she 
can form a majority coalition 
ms bhutto said her pakistan peoples party has emerged as the 
largest single party in the national assembly as a result of 
wednesdays parliamentary election 
given consultations with different groups and independent 
people we are confident that we can get a simple majority the 
35yearold political leader declared after arriving in this 
southern city for coalition talks she would be the first woman to 
lead a moslem nation 
her party captured 92 seats in the 237member assembly compared 
with 55 for the nineparty conservative islamic democratic alliance 
the alliance includes supporters of gen mohammed zia ulhaq the 
military president killed in a plane crash three months ago 
independents and minor parties got 57 seats results from 13 
districts were not available and 20 seats reserved for women will be 
filled later by vote of the assembly 
the last free national assembly election in 1977 was a landslide 
for prime minister zulfikar ali bhutto who founded the pakistan 
peoples party and gen zia overthrew him soon afterward bhutto 
was convicted of complicity in a political murder plot and hanged in 
1979 
in washington the state department praised pakistan a us 
ally for the elections spokesman charles redman said we 
congratulate the pakistani people and their leaders for this 
impressive and important step in strengthening democracy in 
pakistan 
at her family home in larkana earlier thursday ms bhutto urged 
president ghulam ishaq khan to give her party the mandate to form a 
government 
she said she wouild begin coalition talks friday but would not 
name parties on the list likely candidates are some of her 
leftleaning partners in the former opposition alliance called the 
movement for the restoration of democracy 
ms bhutto also is expected to consult a relatively new party of 
moslem immigrants from india called the mqm which carried the 
southern cities karachi and hyderabad 
her personal popularity was demonstrated by the fact that she ran 
for three national assembly seats and won them all two will have to 
be filled through byelections 
the constitution requires the president to designate a person to 
form a government who will be most likely to command the 
confidence of the majority of the national assembly which usually 
would mean the leader of the largest party 
ishaq khan was asked wednesday whether he would be reluctant to 
choose a woman in this maledominated society and he replied i 
think a woman prime minister might be a good change 
pakistans official news agency said the president sent 
congratulatory telegrams to election winners but it did not mention 
deliberations on the choice of a prime minister 
before ms bhutto left for karachi about 5000 supporters 
gathered outside the family villa in karkana dancing jubilantly and 
chanting benazir prime minister 
no major electionrelated violence or fraud was reported by 
officials through thursday but reports of three violent deaths 
appeared in newspapers 
thousands policemen and soldiers patrolled sind a southern 
province noted for ethnic violence on election day 
both ms bhutto and the conservative alliance have said they 
would continue pakistans friendship with the united states and its 
support of moslem guerrillas fighting the communist government of 
neighboring afghanistan 
although ms bhutto also said she would pursue zias program of 
increasing the influence of islam in the nations life she pledged 
not to let the religious policy interfere with the rights women and 
minorities 
mrs bhutto attended both harvard and oxford and is considered 
westernized she lived in europe for several years while zia was in 
power 
zia ruled by martial law for eight years after the coup then 
held national elections 1985 in which political parties were not 
permitted to enter candidates mrs bhuttos party and others in the 
opposition boycotted the elections 
the general dismissed the government and national assembly in may 
on grounds of corruption incompetence and delay in putting pakistan 
under islamic law zia called wednesdays election before the plane 
crash aug 17 in which he the us ambassador and 28 other people 
were killed

a judge ruled thursday that some 
leaders of the nations biggest antiapartheid group committed 
treason by inciting violence during township unrest in 1984 a crime 
punishable by death 
the judge did not say which of the 16 defendants were guilty of 
treason he acquitted three other defendants in the case south 
africas longestrunning political trial it began in june 1985 
supreme court justice kees van dijkhorsts decision was contained 
in a 1521page summary which the judge began reading three days 
ago verdicts against individuals may not be announced until next 
week 
the three bestknown defendants are senior leaders of the united 
democratic front who have been held 40 months without bail popo 
molefe 36 who was the coalitions national secretary terror 
lekota 40 who was its chief spokesman and moses chikane 40 a 
leader of its transvaal province branch 
those acquitted thursday were the rev geoff motselane 41 oupa 
hlomuka 35 and patrick baleka 29 
the united democratic front banned in february was formed in 
1983 to mobilize opposition to a new constitution that excluded the 
black majority from representation in parliament 
all 19 defendants pleaded innocent to charges of treason 
terrorism murder and subversion related to allegations the front 
and its affiliates incited violence when unrest broke out in black 
townships in 1984 
van dijkhorst said that because violence was an intended facet of 
the uprising in the townships the state had proved the crime of 
treason 
the charges of murder which also carry a possible death penalty 
relate to the mob killings of black town councilors during the vaal 
triangle rioting 
van dijkhorst said one of the defendants thomas manthatha urged 
residents in the area to kill councilors he also said the vaal 
civic association a front affiliate to which several defendants 
belonged encouraged confrontational protests that sparked rioting 
the front grew into the largest opposition group in south africa 
encompassing more than 600 affiliated groups with about 2 million 
members most of its leaders are in detention in hiding or barred 
from political activity 
van dijkhorst accepted the prosecutors allegation that the group 
was supported and guided by the african national congress the main 
antigovernment guerrilla movement front leaders maintained they 
endorsed the ancs political goals such as a oneperson onevote 
system but did not advocate the use of violence 
van dijkhorst has presided over the nonjury trial since its 
start and has sole responsibility for the verdict and sentencing 
there originally were 22 defendants in the trial conducted for 
many months in the town of delmas before being shifted to pretoria 
three men were acquitted in 1986

japans refusal to import us rice is the work of 
an evil empire of cooperatives manipulating its agricultural 
scene the head of the us rice millers association said thursday 
it is a fantastic example of economic distortion and it 
basically stinks said stephen gabbert president of the group of 
rice producers in six us states 
he said japan could start to ease much of what he sees as its 
social problems by liberaling its strictly controlled rice market 
in october the us government rejected a petition by the rice 
millers association complaining about japans ban on rice imports 
but it noted japans policy contravened trade agreements 
gabbert reserved his sharpest attack for the network of 
agricultural cooperatives that are powerful political lobbyists with 
huge economic resources 
japans rice policy gabbert said is tied to a cooperative 
framework which i would characterize as basically an evil empire 
the cooperative movement is supposed to help japanese farmers and 
consumers but it exploits farmers and gouges consumers he 
claimed 
he said the cooperatives had mounted an expensive lobbying effort 
in the united states against us rice exports resulting in what he 
saw as some jawdroppers in american news reports and editorials 
saying washington should not press japan to open its sacrosanct rice 
market 
after laborious negotiations earlier this year japan agreed to 
accept more us beef and oranges but firmly rejected calls to open 
its rice market rice is japans staple food and the government 
policy is to keep selfsufficiency in rice though it requires 
massive subsidies to farmers and retail prices more than triple 
those in the united states 
we shouldnt have any sacred or cultural cows in trade 
relationships gabbert said these kinds of sensitivities should 
not be reasons for avoiding confronting trade issues 
rice in japan costs 385 for 22 pounds compared with 1 in the 
united states 
japans 122 million people consume about 103 million tons of 
rice a year the government subsidy last year including some 
payments to keep paddy fields idle was 36 billion 
gabbert proposed a gradual opening of 25 percent a year of 
japans rice market over a fouryear period ten percent of japans 
rice market would be as much as american growers could produce he 
said 
gabbert said he was aiming for 300 million worth of the japanese 
rice market he said american farmers can deliver milled rice at 400 
dollars a ton versus 2500 a ton in japan 
if japan liberalizes its market he predicted that japanese 
farmers would become more efficient that land and housing prices 
would go down because some paddy land would be freed for housing 
and that japanese consumers could spend less on agricultural 
products and more on manufactured imports thus further helping the 
country reduce its huge trade surplus

complicity in the murder of 177 french jews sent to auschwitz a 
verdict that drew shouts of nazi murderer from victims 
relatives and spectators 
count modest korff was accused of ordering the deportations of 
jews from the chalonssurmarne region of northeastern france where 
he served as gestapo chief in 1942 and 1943 
state court judge martin lickfett said the fivemember panel 
decided there was insufficient evidence to tie korff to the deaths 
of 177 people he was accused of deporting 
the proceedings were interrupted by shouts of nazi murderer 
and this is a nazi court said a court spokeswoman eva marie 
zakosekruehling 
korff 79 left the courtroom after the verdict was read and 
could not immediately be reached for comment phone calls to his 
home in the bonn suburb of koenigswinter were not answered 
during the trial korff claimed he did not know about the 
extermination of jews when he served as gestapo chief in 
nazioccupied france the nazis killed an estimated 6 million jews 
during their rule from 1933 to 1945 
ms zakosekruehling said the defendant showed no emotion during 
announcement of the verdict or the outbursts from spectators who 
packed the small courtroom in central bonn the panel was composed 
of two jurors and three judges 
about 20 french relatives of nazi victims were among the 
spectators as well as french nazi hunter serge klarsfeld 
spectators said the french spectators included relatives of those 
whom korff was accused of deporting 
klarsfeld led prosecutors to korff 
klarsfeld and the others who had traveled from france stormed out 
of the courtroom to show their disapproval of the verdict ms 
zakosekruehling said in an interview with the associated press 
until his retirement in the early 1970s korff served as a 
ministerial adviser with the west german economics ministry he was 
free during the trial which began in september 1987 
the acquittal follows a period of extreme sensitivity over 
germanys nazi past after last weeks 50th anniversary of 
kristallnacht when nazi thugs destroyed jewish homes and businesses 
and beat up jews 
jewish community leaders were outraged by a speech in which 
parliament president philipp jenninger referred to the early nazi 
years as glorious in an attempt to explain hitlers initial 
appeal to the german public 
jenninger a member of chancellor helmut kohls christian 
democrat party was forced to resign the next day

presidentelect george bush today named new 
hampshire gov john sununu as his white house chief of staff and 
announced campaign manager lee atwater as his choice to head the 
republican national committee 
the selection of sununu prompted a decision by longtime aide 
craig fuller to leave bushs service fuller had served as the vice 
presidents chief of staff and made it clear he wanted the powerful 
white house post 
john sununu has the background and experience necessary to work 
not only with his former colleagues in the nations statehouses but 
also to build a constructive relationship with the us congress 
bush said 
he said the outgoing threeterm governors background as an 
engineer college professor small businessman and governor will 
bring a refreshing new perspective that in my view is critical he 
is the right man in the job 
im eager to take up the challenge it is going to be a very 
important few years the new chief of staff told reporters 
sununus selection appeared to fuel the departure of fuller 
in a telephone interview fuller said he told bush in october 
that i wanted to return to the private sector but he said he 
also told bush during that conversation that obviously i would be 
eager to serve as chief of staff often called the second most 
powerful position in the white house 
fuller who served as bushs vice presidential chief of staff 
since 1985 said he will resign when bushs transition is completed 
in january 
sununu credited with engineering bushs new hampshire primary 
win brings to the job a reputation as an aggressive handson 
manager 
his appointment cheered conservatives but worried some on 
capitol hill as well as jewish leaders he was the only one of 50 
governors who refused to back a statement denouncing a united 
nations resolution that equated zionism with racism 
he said he would remain governor through his term which ends 
jan 5 but he said he would continue to consult with bushs 
transition team 
as bushs choice atwater was certain to be elected to succeed 
frank fahrenkopf jr as chairman of the republican party fahrenkopf 
is a 48yearold reno lawyer whose seven years in the post make him 
the longestserving gop chief in this century 
i expect the party to move forward and grow i will strongly 
recommend to members of the national committee lee atwater to become 
the chairman said bush describing atwater as a master of 
grassroots politics 
hes a friend im proud of his accomplishments bush said of 
the man who helped orchestrate his presidential victory 
atwater 37 is a south carolina native who earlier served as an 
aide to president reagan and also worked for sen strom thurmond of 
south carolina after the 1984 election atwater became a partner in 
the lobbying firm of black manafort amp stone 
sununu was asked whether he would have trouble in washington 
given that he has never worked for the federal government and given 
his bluntspoken aggressive nature 
im a pussycat sununu said let me tell you about 
washington certainly i have a lot to learn in regard to the 
details i think im a quick learner i consider a great number of 
congressmen to be close friends both democratic and republican 
as to the criticism by jewish leaders for refusing to endorse the 
governors proclamation on the un resolution sununu who is 
partly of arab descent said 
im very sensitive to that issue the problem i had as a 
governor is that i felt it was inappropriate in terms of the issue 
i have no problem saying it should be repudiated 
sununu 49 had declined to run for a fourth term citing a need 
to return to the real world to get a real job sununu and his 
wife nancy have eight children he is credited with helping revive 
bushs candidacy with a win in the new hampshire primary last 
february after the vice president finished a poor third in iowas 
caucuses

a swiss representative of the international 
red cross was kidnapped thursday in sidon and police said his 
captors might intend to swap him for an aircaft hijacker held in 
switzerland 
the plo blamed the abduction on emenies trying to discredit its 
newly proclaimed state of palestine no organization claimed 
responsibility 
in geneva the international committee of the red cross appealed 
for the immediate release of peter winkler 32 and said the icrc 
cannot accomplish its mission unless it remains sheltered from all 
forms of pressure wherever their origin 
spokesman joerg bischof said other representatives had been 
kidnapped in lebanon but were released after a few hours 
fourteen other foreigners including nine americans are missing 
in lebanon most believed to be in the hands of shiite moslem 
extremists loyal to iran held longest is terry a anderson chief 
middle east correspondent of the associated press who was abducted 
march 16 1985 
police said winkler was taken from his car at 845 am in hisbeh 
square in sidon provincial capital of south lebanon they mentioned 
unconfirmed reports that winkler who had been in lebanon only a 
month was taken to the palestinian refugee camp ein elhilweh 
they also theorized the motive might be to trade winkler head of 
the red cross office in sidon for hussein hariri the lebanese 
shiite moslem hijacker held in switzerland 
hariri 22 commandeered an air afrique jetliner on a flight from 
rome to paris and forced it to land in geneva on july 24 1987 he 
killed a french passenger before the crew overpowered him 
hariris relatives in lebanon said at the time he belonged to the 
shiite fundamentalist hezbollah or party of god hezbollah is 
believed to be an umbrella group for most of the kidnappers holding 
foreigners 
plo and local militia officials said radical palestinians may 
have kidnapped winkler to pressure switzerland not to recognize the 
independent state proclaimed in the israelioccupied territories by 
the palestine national council which acts as the plo legislature 
hardline groups backed by syria opposed the declaration because 
it involved acceptance of un resolutions that implicitly recognize 
israel 
six hours after the thursdays kidnapping israeli warplanes made 
mock attacks on palestinian refugee camps on the southern fringe of 
sidon 
israeli jets have buzzed the sidon camps daily since yasser 
arafat chairman of the palestine liberation organization announced 
the new state tuesday at a council meeting in algiers 
police said an olivecolored car without license plates carrying 
three men passed and stopped winklers car at a main traffic circle 
two gunmen pulled winkler from the front passenger seat keeping 
their weapons pointed at his head they pushed him into the back 
seat of their car and the third assailant drove it away 
winkler did not resist and was not beaten said a police 
spokesman naji assaad winklers lebanese driver was left behind 
and reported the abduction 
panicky onlookers made no move to help the spokesman said 
the kidnapping was carried out in less than one minute there was 
no shooting 
assaad said none of the kidnappers was masked and the only one 
wearing a beard was blond with curly hair dressed in dark blue 
trousers and a black leather jacket 
the bearded one shouted out out quickly mr winkler obeyed 
it was a very rapid operation he said 
christophe girod chief international red cross representative in 
south lebanon held a 45minute meeting in sidon with a 
representative of fatahrevolutionary council the guerrilla group 
headed by palestinian terrorist abu nidal 
we discussed the abduction we hope he will released quickly 
girod said but would not elaborate 
representatives of the international red cross are assigned 
abroad to monitor compliance with the geneva conventions and help 
organize humanitarian relief swiss ambassador dino sciolli said 30 
work in lebanon 
a spokesman for the popular nasserite organization militia in 
sidon who would not let his name be used said it appears the 
abduction has been carried out by radical palestinians who regard 
the declaration of the state of palestine a capitulation a 
renunciation of the armed struggle against israel 
the militia a leftist sunni moslem group has controlled sidon 
since the outbreak of lebanons sectarian civil war in 1975 
arafats representative in lebanon issam salem said this is 
an action against the recent declaration of the state of palestine 
winkler is the fifth foreigner working for a humanitarian 
organization either kidnapped or missing in south lebanon in nine 
months 
a swede and a norwegian working for the un relief and works 
agency were kidnapped feb 5 and freed 25 days later a british 
charity worker seized march 3 was held six days and a belgian 
physician working for an aid committee disappeared may 21 but no 
group has claimed to have kidnapped him

the man whose tip led to the arrest of a woman 
suspected in the deaths of seven boardinghouse residents says hes 
not really glad to have put someone in jail but feels like im a 
good citizen 
charles willgues says he was befriended by the pleasant 
grayhaired woman whom he met in a bar but he became suspicious 
because of her interest in his disability checks and her suggestion 
that they live together 
dorothea montalvo puente was arrested late wednesday and was 
being held by police in sacramento for investigation of murdering 
seven tenants found buried in shallow graves outside the victorian 
boardinghouse she ran there 
police believe puente killed the tenants for their social 
security checks 
it was willgues 67 who lives alone in a downtown apartment here 
and draws social security and other disability checks who tipped a 
cbs editor and then police wednesday to puentes whereabouts in a 
motel near a bar where they had met earlier in the day 
he didnt immediately recognize her when he talked with her in 
the bar but he realized later that he had seen her face from a 
morning newscast on cbs 
im not really happy about putting somebody in jail willgues 
said in a telephone interview i am happy in a way though i 
believe in justice i feel like im a good citizen 
he said puente seemed pleasant when they met at the bar an 
outoftowner in need of a friend she told willgues she was from 
san francisco and was looking for a place to repair her shoes 
i took her shoes across the street to a shoe repair place and 
thats how the whole thing got started willgues said 
she told him she was an only child that her husband died a month 
ago and that the cab driver who took her to her motel stole her 
luggage willgues said 
she seemed nice and sincere he said 
but he said she had a strange interest in his disability checks 
and after only one meeting she started talking about living together 
i didnt exactly agree to that i said we should talk about it 
tomorrow we were going to go shopping he said 
when he got home the womans face wouldnt leave him i said 
to myself that i know this woman ive seen her before he said 
then he remembered and called the local cbs bureau and with the 
help of assignment editor gene silver willgues found out who his 
mystery woman was 
i wasnt just going for the scoop silver said later this 
woman could have been trying to prey on him he was disabled and 
drawing a pension it became more than just a story it became a 
concern for somebodys life 
silver went to willgues apartment and the two of them looked at 
a newspaper photo of the woman and watched a newscast of the story 
about the buried bodies they decided to call police said silver 
another elderly man who knew puentes said wednesday that he may 
have unwittingly helped dig the graves in the boardinghouse lawn 
i was just doing favors for dorothea she was always asking us 
to do things for her said homer myers 74 he said she told him 
the holes were for a tree or for garbage 
myers said he lived at montalvos boardinghouse for two years 
but moved out last week after refusing to sign over his checks to 
her 
i feel real lucky just to be here talking he said i guess 
i could have ended up in one of those holes i dug 
myers said boardinghouse tenants seldom exchanged more than a few 
words and assembled together only for meals twice a day sometimes 
boarders disappeared but folks were always coming and going he 
said nothing unusual about that

the state department on thursday announced the 
expulsion of an iraqi diplomat in retaliation for the 
unjustified ouster of an american diplomat in baghdad 
but spokesman charles e redman stressed the united states wanted 
to improve relations with the arab country there are mutual 
interests he said 
us relations with iraq were restored by president reagan in 
1984 after a 17year break some analysts detected a trend toward 
moderation in the ruling baath party 
the ousted american was identified thursday in baghdad as heywood 
rankin head of the us embassys political section who has since 
left the country diplomats in the iraqi capital said he had made an 
unauthorized trip to the north home of iraqs estimated 35 million 
kurds 
but a us official here who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said the trip had been approved by the iraqis 
the state department earlier this year criticized iraqs 
treatment of the nonarab minority and accused iraq of using 
chemical weapons against iran in the persian gulf war 
without identifying rankin redman said none of his activities 
have been incompatible in any way with his diplomatic status he 
declined to say whether the american had met with the kurds 
however redman said he did not know of any restrictions on us 
contacts the spokesman called the expulsion a serious matter 
and said in retaliation assistant secretary of state richard w 
murphy had informed the iraqi ambassador abdulamir alanbari that 
an iraqi diplomat assigned to the embassy in washington had been 
declared persona non grata 
this action was taken in response to the unjustified expulsion 
of a us diplomat in baghdad by the iraqi government the 
spokesman said 
redman declined to identify the iraqi or his job efforts to 
reach the embassy by telephone were unsuccessful 
about 60000 kurds fled across the northern border to turkey and 
thousands of others went into iran in august claiming iraq dropped 
chemical bombs on their villages the state department said it had 
substantiated the accusations 
militants among the 20 million kurds living in a region extending 
into turkey iran and iraq have fought for independence for the past 
century 
iraq attacked kurdish settlements on its northwestern border 
shortly after accepting an aug 20 ceasefire in its eightyear war 
with iran kurdish guerrillas received support from iran during the 
war 
congress considered imposing economic sanctions against iraq 
based on state department reports it was using chemical weapons 
against its kurdish minority iraq denied the use and the 
legislation was dropped in the rush to adjourn congress before the 
november us presidential election

earth to aliens earth to aliens are you 
listening 
ok get this youre welcome to visit new york maybe check out a 
basketball game or two but make sure you bring plenty of cash 
there are some great real estate deals you wouldnt want to miss 
that in part is what earthlings had to say to their 
extraterrestrial neighbors thursday when atampt gave people an 
opportunity to direct dial the rest of the universe 
the company set up a camera and microphone outside its manhattan 
headquarters and began recording about 30 hours of videotaped 
messages that will be beamed via satellite into outer space sometime 
between thanksgiving and new years passersby were encouraged to 
step up and sound off so long as they werent obscene 
the idea was to let those aliens if theyre out there if 
theyre intelligent and if they get good tv reception know were 
here 
the extraterrestrials might want to know for instance the news 
that 13yearold moises bermudez was anxious to communicate to the 
void i hope you saw the knicks versus the bullets because the 
knicks won 
or this message from 24yearold tom franz a madison avenue real 
estate agent i have this great real estate investment here but i 
need 25000 if youre interested give me a call 
alistair levy a 9yearold visitor from london was friendly 
life on earth is great here i hope you have a nice time invading 
us 
kiernan varas 13 an eighthgrade classmate of moises bermudez 
at manhattans clinton school was thoughtful i hope the quest 
for knowledge lasts forever 
and another classmate 13yearold lisette lazu was poignant 
hello my name is lisette im deaf but i would like to hear from 
you 
the search for extraterrestrial life is nothing new as atampt 
officials are quick to admit scientists have sent messages for 
aliens into space before and the national aeronautics and space 
administration funds a project the search for extraterrestrial 
intelligence that is devoted to hunting for signals from beyond 
furthermore normal radio and television signals are escaping 
into space all the time setting out on theoretically infinite 
voyages that could someday bring reruns of mr ed into living 
rooms in another galaxy 
given all that whats the point of adding to the intergalactic 
information glut 
former astronaut michael collins now a private consultant who 
was hired by atampt to appear at the space message promotion had an 
answer 
i think the fundamental problem of trying to communicate with 
other parts of the universe is that the universe is just so large 
and covers such a time span that any effort to send a message 
out is worthwhile he said any time you add to the sum total of 
information going out i think thats a worthwhile effort 
is there intelligent life out there 
i think the prospects are good collins said i think if 
you look out there and count the number of stars and then begin 
making the most pessimistic assumptions you still have to conclude 
that there are trillions and trillions of stars as suitable as our 
own for sustaining life i think its a form of cosmic conceit to 
think that were the only planet in the entire vast universe which 
has been successful in that regard 
in other words as 12yearold luis maldonado said theres a 
pretty good chance we cant tell if there is something else out 
there and we cant tell if theres not

it could be a dark christmas this year 
because the citys holiday decorations have been contaminated in 
storage by asbestos dust 
the pole decorations normally hung along carl albert parkway were 
stored in the old navy reserve center which the citys parks 
departments has used for storage 
an inspection this year revealed old insulation was releasing 
potentially hazardous asbestos particles into the air asbestos has 
been identified as a potential cancercausing substance when inhaled 
the building was closed and crews were able to remove and clean 
street signs in the building but mel priddy head of the parks and 
recreation department said cleaning the lights would require more 
labor than they are worth 
the city council offered to pay half of the 5000 replacement 
costs for new decorations but no one has offered to match the 
citys expense for the project priddy said 
i would say right now the city is looking toward next year 
not this one he said adding that even with the money there 
might not be time to buy decorations for this year 
richard francis mcalester schools director of maintenance is 
licensed to handle asbestos but he said the decorations may be a 
lost cause 
we had to have special permission from the department of labor 
to remove the other items and they have said no more he said

when attorney general edwin meese iii heard 
that donald regan had abruptly resigned as president reagans chief 
of staff he put in a quick telephone call to howard baker 
howard i think you better get over to the white house he 
told the former tennessee senator who was in line to succeed regan 
theres no one in charge 
the story told by former baker aide jim cannon speaks volumes 
about the key role played in the modern white house by an official 
unheard of a few decades ago 
attention is focused on the job again by presidentelect george 
bushs announcement thursday that he is naming outgoing new 
hampshire gov john sununu to the post 
the job of chief of staff requires the ability to lead to 
motivate to direct an important organization in the best interests 
of the country bush said in making the announcement 
sununu said my principal responsibilities will be to make sure 
that the new president gets the information and the tools that he 
needs to make the policies that dicate the programs that will go 
forth from the white house i am also very aware that once those 
policies are made i have a responsibility to try and get them 
implemented as effectively as they can 
sununu said the key to how he operates as chief of staff will be 
the way the vice president once he becomes president wants the 
white house run 
in dealing with domestic policy issues he said i have two 
responsibilities one is to be an honest broker and present the 
views on the various sides of the issue and after i fulfill that 
then i have the opportunity to indicate my recommendations 
sununu will be the second former governor to hold the position 
baker was a former senate majority leader regan was a former 
treasury secretary 
yet the post of chief of staff is not even mentioned in the 
constitution and no president had one until dwight eisenhower the 
former army general came to the white house growling do i have 
to be my own sergeant major 
most people would think that even without donald regan or howard 
baker or for that matter john sununu there is somebody in charge 
at the white house the president 
of course he is in charge said cannon who has observed the 
process both as an adviser to baker and as a senior aide to 
president ford 
however he added given the size and complexity of problems in 
washington now you cant run a good administration without a 
firstrate chief of staff 
does this make the staff chief a glorified clerk or possibly the 
second most powerful official in the government depends on how you 
look at it but closer to the second than the first 
constitutionally he is and has to be the presidents mere 
dogsbody to borrow a british term presidential scholar richard 
e neustadt of harvard university wrote in a 1986 study of the chief 
of staff 
the oxford english dictionary defines dogsbody as a junior 
person especially one to whom a variety of menial tasks is given 
dont kid yourself the white house chief of staff is nobodys 
dogsbody 
the chief of staff is system manager the boss of none but the 
quarterback of everything former white house aide bradley h 
patterson jr writes in a new book on the white house staff the 
ring of power 
he is anything but a pencil pusher said cannon 
if there is a tornado in oklahoma or a crisis in afghanistan 
word of it comes to the chief of staff who is on call at all hours 
of the day or night 
a chief of staffs power thus derives from his ability to 
schedule the presidents time allocate access to him and shape his 
agenda samuel l popkin of the university of california at san 
diego wrote in the 1986 study 
after regans abrupt resignation said cannon it would have 
been awkward if something very serious had happened somewhere in the 
country or the world and there was no chief of staff in the white 
house 
the role of the chief of staff varies however from 
administration to administration 
presidents kennedy and johnson chose not to have such 
functionaries although other aides filled much the same role nixon 
returned to having a chief of staff and ford followed suit carter 
first favored a spokes of the wheel approach in which various 
assistants reported directly to him but abandoned it and made 
hamilton jordan chief of staff 
discussing bushs staff chief cannon said i think probably he 
will have less power relatively than the present chief of staff 
because ronald reagans style was to turn over more decisions to the 
chief of staff my feeling is that bush will have more decisions 
in his own hands and less in the hands of the chief of staff 
and what of craig fuller the former white house aide who headed 
bushs staff through most of his second term as vice president 
he was in the running for white house chief of staff but was 
passed over and reportedly was being considered for a cabinet post 
instead 
he declined the consolation prize before it was offered 
announcing thursday that he would have been happy to be chief of 
staff but now plans to return to private life

the collapse of one of the worlds 
largest radiotelescopes will hinder astronomy over the long term and 
will even hamper an experiment planned for an upcoming space shuttle 
mission experts say 
the dishshaped radiotelescope at the national radio astronomy 
observatory at green bank which crashed tuesday night was as wide 
as a football field is long but built on a shoestring budget 26 
years ago it was capable of listening to objects 10 billion light 
years away 
its a major blow theres no way to deny that said george 
seielstad nraos assistant director at the green bank operations 
seielstad said the telescopes loss will affect a long list of 
research proposals including a future space shuttle project 
the gamma ray observatory is scheduled to be launched by nasa 
in 1990 from the space shuttle and one of the things they will look 
for will be pulse signals he said we were going to use this 
telescope to monitor 100 of the brightest pulsars in conjunction 
with the gamma ray observations 
he said no other telescope can take over such work 
were shocked said donald backer a university of 
californiaberkeley astronomer who is doing pulsar research at a 
sister observatory in arecibo puerto rico well miss it 
im sure a lot of operators of big dishes elsewhere across the 
world are going to go out next week or tomorrow morning and check 
what they never checked before 
backer who used green banks 300foot radiotelescope last year 
to search for pulsars said it long ago exceeded its expected 
lifespan it was built for 850000 in 1962 
engineers from the national science foundation which funds green 
bank for a consortium of nine universities flew to the site 
wednesday in an attempt to discover what caused the dish to topple 
seielstad said the telescopes 600 tons of metal dropped to the 
ground without warning tuesday night the twin steel towers upon 
which the structure moved were twisted and snapped white aluminum 
mesh panels that once made up the dish blanketed the rubble like an 
umbrella pushed insideout 
it looks so much like someone lifted a big bowl into the air 
and let it drop seielstad said 
the unidentified employee operating the radiotelescope said there 
was no warning seielstad said 
workers said the structure routinely snapped and popped 
especially as it cooled at night but that it had survived heavy 
snows thunderstorms and 75 mph winds weather was calm tuesday 
night when the scope tumbled to the ground workers said 
the radiotelescope was capable of intercepting naturally emitted 
radio signals from celestial bodies billions of light years away 
its most celebrated contribution to science came in 1968 when 
astronomers used it to discover a pulsar at the center of the crab 
nebula the find helped prove that pulsars are the dense remains of 
supernovae or exploded stars 
the observatory which opened in 1959 has eight smaller 
telescopes the smallest 40 feet in diameter green bank is located 
in the monongahela national forest about 10 miles from the virginia 
border

a panel of leading mexicans and americans 
recommended thursday that the united states give top priority to 
curbing us demand for drugs as part of a more balanced policy in 
dealing with that problem 
the recommendation was contained in a lengthy study by the 
bilateral commission on the future of united statesmexican 
relations on five areas of concern between the two countries 
the commission was cochaired by william d rogers who held two 
senior state department posts during the ford administration and 
hugo b margain a member of the mexican senate who is a former 
ambassador to the united states 
the 238page study said the united states has placed excessive 
emphasis on law enforcement to curb drug smuggling and that recent 
increases in funding levels to reduce demand for drugs will prove 
inadequate 
the commission urges the us to give top priority to learning 
how to reduce demand and to allocate sufficient resources to move 
rapidly in attacking this critical problem the report said 
a balanced strategy must also include a vigorous international 
effort in which drug control concerns are given high diplomatic 
priority it said 
it suggested that the us government subordinated the drug issue 
in its relations with panama and honduras because priority was given 
to security concerns 
such obviously selective application of its international 
narcotics control policy undermines us credibility with other 
countries and with the multilateral institutions pledged to combat 
drug abuse the report said 
release of the report was timed to coincide with the advent of 
new administrations in both mexico and the united states mexican 
presidentelect carlos salinas de gortari will be inaugurated on 
dec 1 seven weeks before his us counterpart george bush 
rogers told a news conference that mexico stands second only to 
the soviet union in its significance to the us copies of the 
report were delivered to secretary of state george p shultz and 
national security adviser colin powell 
the report also covered such issues as economics migration 
foreign policy and education following are excerpts 
debt for mexico debt service obligations in the future 
should be designed subject to its capacity to pay under conditions 
of growth without growth adjustment will not be sustained without 
growth resources for debt service will not be available 
trade both countries should continue to agree to generalized 
trade concessions they should move promptly to freetrade 
agreements in all sectors where benefits from free trade may exist 
especially industrial sectors 
migration both governments should undertake to reach a 
bilateral accord on migration which should consider a possible 
increase in the legal quotas of mexican migration to the us an 
agreement on the flow and treatment of seasonal agricultural 
workers the protection of migrants human and labor rights and the 
possibility of a longrun temporary worker program 
foreign policy a first step is to initiate a frank and open 
dialogue on the concept of regional security the commission 
believes that regional security involves not only militarystrategic 
concerns but must also encompass questions of socioeconomic 
development 
other commission members included former world bank president 
robert mcnamara san antonio mayor henry cisneros and colegio de 
mexico president mario ojeda

state and local government reliance on federal 
aid last year sank to its lowest level in more than 20 years the 
census bureau said thursday 
from a high of 187 cents per dollar of state and local 
government revenue in 1978 the federal contribution withered to 
136 cents in 1987 it was the lowest since 1966 when lyndon 
johnson was gearing up the great society programs and the federal 
contribution was 135 cents per dollar 
total federal aid actually has risen throughout the period from 
70 billion in 1978 to 113 billion in 1986 to 115 billion in 
1987 but it is increasing at a slower rate than other state and 
local government revenues 
while the federal contribution grew at an average of 57 percent 
a year from 1978 to 1987 the amount raised by state and local taxes 
grew an average of 85 percent a year 
last year state and local taxes grew 86 percent to 4051 
billion while federal aid increased only 17 percent revenue from 
all sources totaled 8426 billion 
henry wulf a census bureau analyst said the federal share 
likely will slip again in future years because state and local 
governments will be increasing spending to upgrade 
infrastructure items such as sewers and roads 
randolph arndt a spokesman for the national league of cities 
said the trend is disturbing because the bulk of state and local 
taxes based either on sales or real estate are more regressive 
than the federal sliding scale for income taxes 
also he said the significance of these reductions goes beyond 
the numbers in that the results have been felt most severely in 
those communities where needs are already the greatest 
the fact is when a region is distressed whether it is the oil 
patch now or the great lakes rust belt earlier in the decade it has 
much less capacity to generate revenues he said 
arndt said federal assistance began declining in the carter 
administration as part of an effort to fight inflation it continued 
to decline in administration of president reagan first as part of 
reagans new federalism shifting many government functions to 
the local level and second as part of the effort to reduce the 
federal budget deficit 
according to the census bureau state and local government 
spending grew 81 percent last year to 7753 billion up 579 
billion compared with a 91 percent rise a year earlier average 
growth in spending since 1978 has been 11 percent 
topping the spending list were education 227 billion 293 
cents per dollar spent public welfare 83 billion 107 cents 
publicly owned utilities 66 billion 85 cents and highways 52 
billion 67 cents 
salaries and wages accounted for 354 percent of state and local 
government spending but increased at a slightly slower rate 69 
percent than overall spending 
outstanding state debt also increased up 91 percent to 7187 
billion

the handwritten manuscript of franz kafkas the 
trial which was smuggled to safety during world war ii despite 
the authors dying wish that it be burned sold for a record 198 
million thursday 
the 316page text of the novel which came to symbolize 
20thcentury totalitarianism was bought at auction by the german 
state government of badenwuerttemberg for 11 million pounds 
kafka a czechoslovak jew completed the novel in 1920 and it was 
published in 1925 a year after he died from tuberculosis at age 41 
the novels hero joseph k who has done nothing wrong is 
arrested tried and executed without ever being told of what he is 
accused 
the novels terrifying account of ks entrapment in judicial 
bureaucracy gave the word kafkaesque to the language 
kafka gave his manuscripts in 1924 to max brod who ignored the 
writers orders to burn them and fled with the works to palestine 
the night the german army entered prague in 1938 brod kafkas 
literary executor died in 1968 
a spokesman for the state government in stuttgart said the 
manuscript would probably go to the german literature archives in 
marbach 
we want it in germany because kafka wrote it in german and 
because it is the most important novel of our century said the 
successful bidder antiquarian bookseller heribert tenschert from 
rotthalmunster near munich 
i would have bought it for myself and paid double what i did 
but our authorities contacted me to buy it i would have gone to 2 
or 3 million pounds tenschert told reporters outside sothebys 
saleroom 
the 40yearold bookseller a previous buyer of medieval 
manuscripts in london added it is definitely a very good deal a 
bargain for such a work one has to be prepared to pay 
i hope there will be a lot of happiness in germany about this 
purchase especially at this price 
the seller was not identified 
brod left his papers to his secretary and companion ester hoffe 
when tenschert was asked if ms hoffe was the seller he hesitated 
and then said he couldnt discuss that 
auctioneer roy davids started the bidding at 400000 pounds or 
720000 and ended it one minute later with tenschert and another 
person bidding in 90000 increments 
asked if he knew who the other bidder was tenschert said i 
wasnt interested in underbidders i was determined to get it i 
knew i would get it 
the final bid was exactly 1 million pounds but the auctioneers 
add a 10 percent commission 
the price was an auction record for any modern literary 
transcript auctioneers define modern as anything written since 
the middle ages a historians loose term for the 5th to 15th 
centuries 
the price eclipsed the 605000 paid in new york last year for 
kafkas letters to his fiancee felice bauer and the previous 
record for a purely literary work the 275000 pounds about 
370000 paid in july 1985 for a notebook of poetry and prose by 
irish writer william butler yeats 
what makes the trial even more valuable is that brod left his 
own manuscripts in prague to put kafkas in his suitcase 
tenschert said 
tenschert said he will pay for the manuscript when he returns to 
london on dec 6 the twoweek delay needed for british authorities 
to issue an export license 
poor old kafka he died broke commented a reporter 
yes said tenschert and my wife said if i bought the 
trial i should burn it because kafka wanted that 
well if it was my money buying it i would consider that but i 
cant because someone else is paying

a 30pound package carrying four 
experiments and 52 envelopes rocketed 14000 feet high and was 
recovered despite parachute failure thursday in what was touted as 
the first private commercial space flight 
a 10foot rocket not much bigger than those launched by weekend 
hobbyists burned for 44 seconds as it propelled the payload over a 
fiveminute course dropping it into the atlantic ocean two miles 
offshore 
officials of eprime aerospace co reported the main parachute 
did not open but that a smaller pilot chute did work and was 
sufficient to land the payload safely divers recovered it in good 
condition 
jim mizell eprime operations director said a flight monitoring 
experiment to measure acceleration and temperatures failed to 
operate during the flight but that the other experiments went well 
he reported slight water seepage into the payload section 
ken havekotte a space stamp enthusiast said some of the 
envelopes bearing covers commemorating the flight got damp but 
they were dried out and most were mailed to collectors 
eprime of nearby titusville hopes the success will lead to 
investor interest in the company so it eventually can buy bigger 
rockets capable to orbiting commercial space payloads stockholders 
and potential investors were among the 200 people who watched the 
liftoff from the beach half a mile from the launch pad 
in trying to attract investors eprime billed the flight as the 
first truly commercial space flight but by the companys own 
definition space starts 75 miles up and nasa has launched several 
commercial payloads for paying customers over the years 
however it was the first time a privately owned rocket had been 
launched from either air force or nasa facilities here 
the company paid the air force 24000 for use of of an old 
weather rocket launch pad and some support services it also had to 
buy 1 million in liability insurance to cover any damage to air 
force property 
mizell a former nasa engineer said the experiments on board the 
rocket were from paying customers he declined to say how much they 
had paid except that it was not enough to make the flight 
profitable a high school teacher whose class developed one of the 
experiments said they paid 5 
he estimated the total the fledgling company has spent so far at 
200000 
the socalled commercialization of space to bring the 
private sector into the launching of satellites and other space 
activity has been a major goal of the reagan administration 
mizell said his company has a long way to go before it can become 
a viable provider of commercial launch services for space payloads 
he noted that thursdays flight had been delayed a year while the 
company met the governments financial safety and techncial 
requirements 
he said eprime hopes to launch a second rocket of the same size 
early next year 
the flight thursday was called loft1 for launch operations 
flight test the rocket carried a biology experiment from a 
huntsville ala high school a thinfilm polymer experiment from 
morton thiokol inc and utah state university the flight monitoring 
system for measuring acceleration and temperature from qsi corp and 
weber state college in utah and a data collection and telemetry 
system from the university of alabama at huntsville 
jayne russell a teacher at jo johnson high school in 
huntsville said the biology experiment involved sending plant seeds 
into space they will be planted and their growth rates compared 
with those of other seeds

justice department panels set up in the wake of 
last years prison riots by mariel boatlift detainees have reviewed 
their first 28 cases and plan to send at least 15 of the prisoners 
back to their native cuba in the near future officials said 
thursday 
the announcement aroused the anger of many in the cuban community 
in miami and attorneys representing the prisoners flew to alabama 
seeking to halt the repatriation process 
the 15 cuban detainees are being held in a strict lockdown in 
a penitentiary in talladega ala no detainee will be scheduled for 
return to cuba earlier than 72 hours after the government officially 
notifies each of the 15 detainees the justice department said 
the 15 the department said should be repatriated have convictions 
ranging from petty larceny to seconddegree murder most of them 
have more than one conviction 
the threemember panels will undertake further consideration of 
the remaining 13 detainees in the initial review group to determine 
whether they should also be returned to cuba or be released 
the panels were set up at the justice department in the wake of 
last years prison riots by cuban detainees at atlanta and oakdale 
la the rioting occurred after a us agreement with cuban president 
fidel castro to resume sending many of the detainees back to the 
island deportations of mariel detainees from the united states to 
cuba were suspended by castro in may 1985 
the detainees are among 125000 people who came to the united 
states in 1980 in a boatlift from mariel cuba and the vast 
majority of them have become lawabiding us residents 
the reviews conducted by these panels go beyond anything thats 
required by law or by court order cary copeland a deputy 
associate attorney general told a news conference theyre 
designed to give the detainee and his representative every 
opportunity to tell the panels anything they feel appropriate in 
reaching their decisions 
two attorneys went to birmingham ala to challenge the justice 
departments action in federal court 
one of the attorneys leo ochoa said the expulsions violate the 
basic us guarantee of due process under the law 
in many cases ochoa said the prisoners were not permitted to 
meet with their attorneys to submit documents for the administrative 
appeals the government agreed to after last novembers riots 
were saying that many of these people are rehabilitated many 
of these people are not dangerous ochoa said but theyre going 
to be deported nevertheless because they couldnt meet their burden 
of proof 
copeland said right now i think weve got about 500 mariel 
detainees who will undergo justice department reviews to determine 
whether they would be repatriated to cuba copeland said there are 
another several hundred serving sentences in state and local 
jails who eventually will receive repatriation reviews 
according to information released by the justice department most 
of the 15 detainees have various relatives living in the united 
states but only a few have wives 
george calhoun the justice department official overseeing the 
mariel cuban review process said the panels decided that on 
balance they could not subject the society to the greater harm 
of releasing the detainee 
i think it is ironic that the us government chooses to 
continue on the unfortunate path of deporting people to a country 
that our own un ambassador has characterized as one of the 
worlds darkest dungeons said gary leshaw director of the 
nonprofit atlanta legal aid organization representing mariel 
detainees 
separate justice department parole review panels were also 
established in the wake of last years riots and those panels have 
reviewed 11 cases to date calhoun and copeland said the panels 
determined that six detainees should remain in the custody of the 
immigration and naturalization service the other five will receive 
further review to determine if they are suitable for parole 
the justice department reviews are in addition to reviews 
conducted by the immigration and naturalization service 
since june 1987 the ins has approved more than 2400 cuban 
detainees for parole another 400 detainees have been recommended 
for release

the new stealth bomber is unlikely to be able 
to carry out its wartime job of destroying mobile soviet 
nucleartipped missiles according to a report issued thursday 
the soviets probably will be able to counter the bomber meaning 
prospects for success in holding a significant fraction of soviet 
mobile targets at risk are very poor said the report by the union 
of concerned scientists 
the 19yearold private organization has been critical of other 
reagan administration national security policies particularly 
president reagans star wars antimissile research program 
the report was issued less than a week before the air force 
publicly unveils the bomber for the first time the plane known as 
the b2 uses composite materials and an unusual flying wing 
shape to hide it from soviet radars 
the air force is planning to buy 132 b2s at a cost of 688 
billion making it one of the most expensive weapons ever built 
the stealth would be one of the components along with the new 
b1 and older b52 of the bomber leg of americas threepronged 
nuclear force other components of that deterrent are landbased and 
submarinebased nuclear missiles 
according to the union of concerned scientists study the main 
mission of the stealth bomber would be to hunt down and destroy 
soviet mobile nuclear targets during a protracted nuclear conflict 
but that could cause arms control problems the study noted with 
both nations aiming to cut their arsenals of longrange atomic 
weapons by 50 percent through start negotiations under way in 
geneva the survivability of their remaining forces will be 
critical to stability it said 
for the landbased forces of both superpowers mobility will be 
a key means of satisfying this requirement the report said the 
b2 bomber is thus out of phase with the trend of arms control 
at a time when the united states should be tailoring its 
procurement of strategic forces to the poststart world and to the 
realities of a constant or declining defenses budget the b2 is a 
step in the wrong direction the report noted 
but capt jay defrank an air force spokesman said the b2 
may be at the heart of solving the mobile icbm intercontinental 
ballistic missile problem but the mobile missile issue is not the 
heart of the b2 requirement 
the b2s primary mission is deterrence across the spectrum of 
conflict defrank said the b2 will have the capability to 
penetrate the most sophisticated enemy defenses and threaten their 
most valued targets whatever they may be 
but there are other problems the study said for example the 
b2 would be vulnerable to future soviet defenses such as 
spacebased radar systems that could look down and spot the 
plane 
in addition the aerial refueling planes and necessary airfields 
needed to support b2 flights wouldnt survive a prolonged nuclear 
war the study contended

farmers could live with a spending freeze 
designed to erase red budget ink without new taxes if they were not 
singled out for sacrifice the leader of the nations largest farm 
group said thursday 
im not talking about eliminating federal programs or cutting 
current outlays dean kleckner president of the american farm 
bureau federation told a news conference 
im only suggesting a moratorium on spending increases 
kleckner said stop the increases just the increases and the 
budget would balance itself 
kleckner an iowa hog corn and soybean producer is a member of 
the national economic commission which is seeking ways to reduce 
the deficit he has been mentioned as a possible bush selection for 
secretary of agriculture 
kleckner said even a partial freeze with 30 billion to 40 
billion in new spending could reduce the deficit quickly because of 
projected increases in revenue over the next five years of 80 
billion to 90 billion annually 
bush has urged a flexible freeze to reduce the deficit while 
vowing not to attempt to balance the budget with a tax increase 
it remains unclear how a flexible freeze might effect politically 
popular farm payments programs which totaled 175 billion last 
year 
rebellion would not erupt in the farm belt over a freeze provided 
the agricultural sector did not come in for disproportionate cuts 
kleckner said 
im convinced that farmers wont object to a freeze as long 
as they understand that they are not alone he said 
but claimed that the idea behind the national economic commission 
was to recommend a politically unpalatable tax increase and in so 
doing allow politicians to shift the blame from their own shoulders 
lets be honest kleckner said the commission was created 
to provide cover for a tax increase 
kleckner said there has been a campaign in the news media and 
elsewhere to convince voters that there is no alternative to a tax 
increase 
the common conventional washington wisdom is that unless you 
people know that we need a tax increase to balance the budget you 
have your head in the sand and youre from sticksville kleckner 
said 
he said the bush victory was evidence that the bulk of american 
voters take exactly the opposite view of a tax hike 
i will make the case that the election was a referendum on that 
issue because the other issues werent that clear he said

the federal communications commission on 
thursday authorized construction of 13 domestic communications 
satellites and the launch of nine it also authorized construction 
and launch of 10 replacement satellites 
the action brings to 42 the number of authorized domestic 
satellites providing a variety of telecommunications services 
including video and data services 
the fcc said the newly authorized satellites set to be launched 
through 1994 will provide domestic satellite capacity through the 
end of the century 
the last group of satellites was authorized in 1985 of the 20 
spacecraft in the group only four are being constructed the 
remaining 16 were casualties for various reasons notably a slump in 
the satellite industry following the explosion of the space shuttle 
challenger in january 1986 which grounded the us space program 
and severely limited commercial satellite launch options said fern 
jarmulnek an fcc satellite official 
the commission said it granted all of the applications it 
received for the orbital slots 22300 miles above the equator the 
authorizations leave nine slots unassigned jarmulnek said 
in making assignments the fcc also changed the position of 
certain slots in the orbit as required by a recent agreement with 
canada and mexico expanding the orbital space assigned to those two 
countries in reassigning us satellites however the united 
states retains the same number of orbital slots for its satellites 
as a result of the agreement three us satellites that are in 
orbit will have to relocate this will be accomplished by firing 
small thruster rockets on the satellites that are used to finetune 
the spacecrafts position in orbit

president reagan signed legislation thursday 
prohibiting the construction of hydroelectric dams on stretches of 
the snake and salmon rivers in idaho 
the measure also was designed to prohibit the federal energy 
regulatory commission from granting a license for a hydroelectric 
facility on lake tobesofkee in georgia without approval of the 
governing body of bibb county 
the president said part of the bill was unconstitutional because 
it would have given local authorities power to perform significant 
authority pursuant to federal laws as a result he said he was 
signing the bill with the understanding that it simply forbids the 
licensing of hydroelectric dams on the lake 
sponsors of the bill said it was designed to prevent interference 
with the use of the manmade lake which has 345 private homes and a 
number of county beaches on its shores and to avoid interference 
with county revenues 
in idaho the bill will affect 33 miles of the snake river north 
of hells canyon and 112 miles of the salmon river upstream from its 
confluence with the snake 
some stretches of the two rivers already are protected from 
dambuilding because they are part of the wild and scenic rivers 
system and sponsors of the bill sought to extend this protection to 
the additional stretches even though they had not been designated 
part of the system

israeli soldiers wounded at least 27 
palestinians during street battles in the occupied lands thursday 
including a 9yearold boy and 14yearold girl who were in critical 
condition hospital officials reported 
the army eased curfews and other restrictions imposed in an 
effort to curtail violence and celebration connected with tuesdays 
proclamation by the plo of an independent palestinian state 
more than 7000 palestinians have been wounded since the uprising 
against israeli occupation began nearly a year ago in the west bank 
and gaza strip which israel captured from jordan and egypt in 1967 
eleven israelis and at least 313 palestinians have been killed 
hospital officials reported at least four people seriously 
wounded in confrontations in tamoun a west bank village and 
several areas of gaza including the shati and deir albalagh 
refugee camps 
the wounded included the 9yearold from the shati camp who was 
shot in the head and a 14yearold girl from tamoun who was hit in 
the spinal cord by a bullet the palestinian doctors said 
in arab east jerusalem a bomb exploded thursday as a police 
vehicle passed nearby israel television said no injuries were 
reported 
the attack followed a day of scattered clashes in jerusalem 
which israel considers its capital three policemen were injured by 
rocks and at least ten palestinians were detained 
islamic extremists circulated a new leaflet thursday urging 
residents of the territories to reject the declaration of an 
independent state by the palestine national council which acts as 
the legislature of the palestine liberation organization 
a fundamentalist group named hamas zeal called for a threeday 
strike beginning friday to protest the declaration which includes 
acceptance of un resolutions that implicitly recognize israel 
palestine extends from the jordan river to the mediterranean 
sea it said this independence is imaginary and does not exist 
in the world of reality 
the pncs acceptance of un resolutions 242 and 338 means 
putting the armed struggle aside and giving israel the right to 
palestine it said 
an army spokesman said troops raided tamoun village 15 miles 
northeast of nablus and soldiers opened fire on young palestinians 
who hurled rocks 
officials at al ittihad hospital in nablus said 13 palestinians 
were wounded three seriously the army confirmed four wounded and 
said it was checking the other reports 
residents said health officials had announced they would give 
polio vaccinations thursday and many of the 50 people wanted by the 
israeli authorities returned to tamoun from hideouts in the area 
soldiers arrived in nine vehicles and ordered the health

stung by an earlier failure to cope with the 
threat of tiny parasitic honey bee mites the agriculture department 
said thursday it plans to hold a special buzz session to design a 
more effective plan 
an advisory committee will try in two weeks to draft new federal 
regulations for preventing further spread of the destructive mites 
which have been reported in 18 states 
beekeeping is credited by usda with the pollination of many 
agricultural crops having an estimated annual value of around 20 
billion those include many fruits vegetables and hay crops 
james w glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said the 15member panel will 
include representatives of state departments of agriculture 
beekeeping organizations and related groups 
the committees first meeting will be held in washington nov 30 
through dec 2 he said 
although not known to be harmful to other creatures the mites 
varroa jacobsoni were first discovered in the united states in 
september 1987 in a wisconsin apiary 
the usda agency imposed a federal quarantine last april to 
restrict movement of bees and bee equipment from infested states but 
canceled it a month later when the regulations proved too complex 
to administer successfully 
glosser said the committee will employ negotiated rulemaking 
to form federal regulations acceptable to the various parts of the 
bee industry 
the varroa mite is an external parasite of adult bees and their 
developing larvae or brood department experts have described the 
female as about onetwentieth of an inch in diameter with the male 
somewhat smaller 
infestations can cause decreased brood numbers deformed bees and 
weakening of the colonys ability to pollinate plants and produce 
honey the mites can infest a colony so gradually that it may be 
unnoticed until serious damage has occurred 
besides wisconsin state where the mites have been found are 
florida georgia illinois indiana maine massachusetts michigan 
minnesota mississippi nebraska new york north dakota ohio 
pennsylvania south carolina south dakota and washington 
glosser said the public can submit written statements at the 
meeting or send them in advance to helene wright aphis usda room

the federal communications commission took a 
major step thursday toward making advanced telephone services such 
as voice mail and computer gateways available on a wide scale to 
average consumers 
the fcc also however reopened a thorny issue that earlier met 
vigorous opposition from the providers of these electronic 
information services who resisted an agency proposal to add hefty 
charges to their bills 
the commissions action moves toward opening the phone networks 
so that connections and circuits will be available on an equal basis 
to competing companies that want to provide advanced phone services 
competition the commission says will result in lower prices and 
more choices for consumers as long as the bell companies are not 
allowed to use their control of the local phone networks to 
disadvantage competitors 
open network architecture as the plan is called will pass 
along to average residential consumers the ability to patronize the 
fruits of the information age said fcc chairman dennis r patrick 
the three sitting commissioners voted unanimously to approve the 
bell companies plans in substantial part but to require revisions 
in specified areas in part to ensure greater uniformity among their 
separate plans the fcc also approved american telephone amp telegraph 
cos plan in total 
many of the enhanced services dealt with in the plans are already 
available on a limited scale from the phone companies open network 
architecture is expected to result in more competition which would 
bring the services to more consumers at lower prices the fcc said 
the fcc pointed to voice mail as an example of a service that it 
expects to become more widely available and attractive to average 
consumers this service permits callers to send and receive recorded 
messages in a manner similar to that now available with telephone 
answering machines 
however instead of having to buy an answering machine callers 
would need only a touchtone phone the messaging capabilities would 
be provided out of a centralized computer 
computer gateways allows easier access to electronic data bases 
computer users would have access to many different information 
services by dialing just one number 
most of the bell companies applauded the action but bellsouth 
said the fcc should have allowed its plan to charge information 
service providers based on their usage of the network instead of a 
flat rate as they are now 
attorney stephen bell who represents tymnet and has been a 
leading spokesman for the information providers said that while 
there was a lot of good news in the fccs action he was 
concerned about the issue of how these providers will be charged by 
phone companies 
the commission specifically noted that an existing exemption from 
network access charges would continue for information service 
providers although the fcc agreed to begin proceedings that could 
consider removing the exemption under certain circumstances 
this could have a dramatic and serious effect on the 
information services industry bell said promising to fight 
vigorously against removal of the exemption 
earlier this year after an outcry from the industry the fcc 
retreated from a proposal to lift the exemption without the 
exemption costs could more than double in some cases for computer 
users dialing into information data bases

political candidates who found themselves 
opposed by lee atwater would often wind up wishing they could hire 
him or else blaming him for alleged dirty tricks that damaged 
their campaigns 
now presidentelect george bush has handpicked the 37yearold 
atwater to work on behalf of all republicans who run for office 
bush selected his former campaign manager thursday to become 
chairman of the republican national committee a choice sure to be 
ratified probably unanimously when the committee meets jan 18 
two days before bushs inauguration 
hes a friend im proud of his accomplishments bush said of 
the man who helped orchestrate his victory nov 8 
atwater will succeed frank fahrenkopf jr a 48yearold reno 
nev lawyer whose seven years in the post make him the 
longestserving gop chief in this century 
atwaters friends say that while he likes having a toughguy 
image his reputation for stepping beyond the bounds of political 
propriety is undeserved 
atwater who described himself as a nuts and bolts 
politician will take control of a party that has been successful 
in electing five of the last six presidents but has not been able to 
gain control of congress politics has been his life hes been 
active since his college days 
i will be extremely campaignoriented atwater told 
reporters adding that he hoped to help republicans win elections 
from the courthouse to the state house to the white house he said 
he would launch special efforts to lure black and hispanic voters 
into republican ranks 
every political reporter in the country worth his salt has 
scoured lees background and havent found one dirty trick said 
christopher simpson press secretary to sen strom thurmond rsc 
atwater a south carolina native worked for thurmond as an intern 
in 1978 
i would say hes tough as nails simpson said i think 
people probably do confuse tough with dirty 
thurmond praised atwater as a superb choice for the rnc post 
hes got a toughguy image said south carolina gop chairman 
van hipp i think lee enjoys it to be honest with you 
at times in the 1988 race for the white house the image of 
atwater pulling strings seemed to drive some of bushs republican 
opponents to distraction 
early this year sen bob dole rkan accused atwater of being 
behind a series of disclosures about his wifes finances 
atwaters answer was to call dole a typical schoolyard bully 
he can dish it out but if someone hits him back he starts 
whining he also sent dole a 10page letter listing negative 
tactics that he said dole had used 
asked about that dole said i dont respond to lee atwater 
but he already had 
a day earlier dole confronted bush on the floor of the senate 
and demanded an apology 
simpson used brilliant to describe atwaters ability of 
drawing an opponents fire to himself and away from the candidate he 
serves 
thats what happened in the dolebush confrontation when dole 
complained heres the bush campaign maybe not the vice president 
himself but lee atwater and others out distributing things that 
they think might reflect on elizabeth dole for some reason 
television evangelist pat robertson at the time also a candidate 
for the gop presidential nomination accused atwater of being 
personally responsible for setting the date of the south carolina 
primary to give bush a boost just before the crucial oneday round 
of southern primaries in march 
robertson could not bring himself to utter atwaters name but 
his meaning was unmistakable i understand a campaign manager of 
an unnamed vice president is from south carolina and he has 
determined he would like to have his man have a bit of an edge by a 
big win here that would propel him to a better showing 
throughout the south 
hipp denied that atwater had anything to do with the timing of 
the south carolina primary 
new york rep jack kemp another of this years unsuccessful 
republican presidential candidates wanted to hire atwater to manage 
his campaign 
ive always been a fan of atwaters i think hes a sharp 
guy kemp said thursday i knew i couldnt hire him 
is he going to have enemies you bet kemp said i think 
people should let bygones be bygones what good is it to hold 
grudges in politics 
atwater signed on with bush whom he had helped defeat for the 
presidential nomination in 1980 at the time atwater was the manager 
of ronald reagans campaign in south carolina and was credited with 
unleashing a series of radio commercials attacking bush on gun 
control 
in 1984 atwater was the deputy manager of reagans reelection 
campaign and later he became a partner in the lobbying firm of 
black manafort amp stone whose 800000 contract to represent the 
bahamian government briefly became a campaign issue this year 
atwater became politically active when he went to college and 
became national director of the college republicans when bush was 
rnc chairman in 197374 
before that he was a professional musician playing the guitar 
for rock n roll singer percy sledge

the judge in the irancontra conspiracy case on 
thursday rejected oliver l norths charges of prosecutorial abuse 
by independent counsel lawrence e walsh saying the defense had 
indulged misinformation and hyperbole in a motion to dismiss the 
case 
north finds it appropriate to assert prosecutorial misdconduct 
in the harshest terms based solely on his selfserving suspicions 
us district judge gerhard a gesell said in turning back the 
motion 
this is not the mark of responsible advocacy gesell said 
chastising the former presidential aides defense lawyers 
this is a motion which by caption and text appears 
significant but which in substance is to a considerable extent 
based on misinformation and hyperbole the judge wrote in a 
fivepage opinion 
the defense contended that prosecutors had given grand jurors 
patently erroneous legal instructions and systematically 
excluded evidence that would show the retired marine lieutenant 
colonels innocence 
but gesell who has reviewed the grand jury transcript said 
these exaggerated statements are made in total disregard of the 
careful instructions and monitoring of the grand jury throughout its 
proceedings by the chief judge of this court 
moreover the statements concerning what occurred before the 
grand jury are largely based on inferences reached by counsel 
without any knowledge of what actually took place during the 
secret proceedings the judge said 
north a former national security council aide is charged with 
conspiring with former national security adviser john m poindexter 
and arms dealers albert hakim and richard v secord to illegally 
divert profits from usiran armssales to the nicaraguan rebels 
no date has been set for norths trial the first of four ordered 
by gesell 
the judge dismissed norths suggestion that prosecutors failed to 
tell the grand jury about whether the socalled boland amendments 
prohibiting direct us military aid to the contras applied to the 
national security council staff 
there is no requirement that the grand jury be instructed on 
every aspect of the law as north appears to suggest gesell said 
never have prosecutors had to present all possible legal 
defenses to a grand jury much less did the independent counsel have 
to introduce the ones suggested by north many of which are based on 
the most speculative of legal theories as this court has so ruled 
in dismissing several of his motions

the environmental protection agency on thursday 
unveiled 19 months late a massive draft revision of regulations 
that could give states and polluters more say in whether toxic waste 
sites are put into the superfund cleanup program 
the agency said it got what we wanted in a long battle with 
the office of management and budget over cleanup standards 
superfund provides money for cleanups only for sites that the 
program has placed on a national priority list currently 
containing 1175 sites out of 30013 possible such a listing also 
qualifies communities for federal health studies and grants to 
community groups and local governments to pay for their 
participation in site discussions 
states contribute 10 percent to cleanup costs direct many 
cleanups under epa oversight and sometimes clean up sites that 
never make the federal program at all companies responsible for 
disposal of the waste in the first place also are handling many 
cleanups 
epas proposed regulations would permit the agency not to list 
sites if a state petitions to handle the cleanup on its own 
epa recognizes that many more sites need to be addressed than 
present superfund resources can accommodate by deferring some 
problem sites to the states epa believes more overall response 
actions can be accomplished more quickly and epa can direct its 
resources to sites that would otherwise not be addressed the 
draft regulation said 
agreements with polluting companies to clean up sites and not put 
them on the priority list may facilitate epa efforts to 
expeditiously obtain such enforcement agreements it said 
epa still would specify the details of the cleanup if the agency 
agreed with a polluter to keep the site off the list it said 
a state might want to keep a site off the superfund priority list 
in the belief that it could get a cleanup finished much more quickly 
than epas cumbersome procedures would allow it wouldnt lose 
federal funds if the company responsible had agreed to pay for the 
cleanup 
a company has an obvious incentive to keep sites off the list 
avoidance of publicity 
j winston porter epas assistant administrator for solid waste 
and emergency response said he believed it would be difficult for a 
state to get full responsibility for a site if its cleanup standards 
were not as strict as epas 
in new york david strait superfund specialist for the natural 
resources defense council said its just outrageous for epa to 
propose ways to give polluters more control over cleanups and leave 
local communities without financial assistance by keeping sites off 
the priority list 
the document also proposes extensive revisions to the numerical 
system by which epa assesses the seriousness of toxic waste sites 
the changes would permit threats to the environment chronic health 
threats and potential threats such as accumulation of a contaminant 
in the food chain to be considered 
epa was required by 1986 amendments to the superfund law to 
publish new final regulations by april 1988 which would have meant 
publishing a draft in april 1987 porter said 
the statutory requirement for having the draft out in six 
months made interesting reading but it just couldnt be done 
porter said 
the 769page fourpound document will attract tons of 
comment and will be adopted in about a year porter said the 
last revision took almost three years from publication to adoption 
from 1982 to 1985 
if there are no other applicable regulations on cancercausing 
chemicals at the site epa proposes to aim at cleanups that will 
leave nearby residents with no more than a one in 10 million to one 
in 10000 chance of getting cancer 
omb had sought to limit the lower end of this range to one in a 
million instead of one in 10 million some court decisions and other 
programs in epa and other agencies have used one in a million as the 
cutoff below which risks may be ignored 
porter said omb had a legitimate question but epa believed 
it would send a terrible message to adopt ombs position because 
the agency already was using the standard 
ombs dispute with epa lasted four months and rep john dingell 
dmich chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the house 
energy and commerce committee said in a statement that 
presidentelect george bush could show his commitment to 
environmental protection by preventing omb from interfering in the 
future 
an aide in ombs press office said she would ask if any officials 
wanted to reply to dingell but no one had responded by thursday 
evening

a us bankruptcy judge on thursday 
rejected two offers for the ptl ministry ordered bidding to start 
from scratch and said hed liquidate the evangelical empire if the 
sale is not completed by dec 13 
its either then or nothing judge rufus reynolds said 
the judge directed ptl bankruptcy trustee mc red benton to 
draft guidelines for prospective buyers that incorporate certain 
conditions he previously set forth 
the auction thursday between two canadian businessmen was 
expected to close the books on the ministry that jim and tammy 
bakker built before a sexandmoney scandal forced it to seek 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from its creditors 
the judge however said he had decided to turn all of them 
down and to start from scratch 
bidding in the december auction will begin at 50 million to 60 
million benton said adding he expected one or two more bidders to 
appear 
reynolds scheduled another auction for dec 12 and said he would 
approve a buyer the next day warning that if the case is not 
concluded by then i will not put up with this case any longer 
under chapter 11 i will move it to chapter 7 
under chapter 7 the doors would be closed and the court would 
proceed to a straight liquidation 
in either case the sale proceeds would be applied to the 
ministrys debts which could reach 130 million 
reynolds said he preferred chapter 11 because chapter 7 doesnt 
bring the most money to the most people 
some creditors have pushed for immediate liquidation citing the 
costs of keeping the facility running reynolds said ptl is losing 
300000 to 400000 a month 
vancouver real estate magnate peter thomas 50 opened the 
bidding thursday with a 70 million cash offer that allowed him to 
back out of the deal within a certain time after closing a 
provision reynolds objected to 
canadian businessman stephen mernick a 34yearold real estate 
developer who is an orthodox jew then bid 115 million with a 50 
million initial payment but reynolds objected that there were 
inadequate assurances that mernick would pay the remaining 65 
million 
both mernick and thomas said they would consider their 
alternatives before deciding whether to continue bidding 
ptl has been operating since last summer as a nonprofit 
corporation known as heritage ministries inc 
the remaining forprofit organization including the theme park 
hotel and shopping mall at the heritage usa complex at fort mill and 
1700 undeveloped acres nearby have been under the bankruptcy 
courts control pending its sale 
with the proposed sale of assets ptl as an entity would cease to 
exist leaving behind only heritage ministries inc 
australian businessman gavin morehu charlotte nc businessman 
george shinn and bakker all have said they wanted to buy the site 
then faded from view bakker fell from the bidding earlier this fall 
when he was unable to raise a 3 million down payment the bakkers 
now are trying to raise money for a new tv ministry 
the effort to sell ptl has dragged on since reynolds withdrew an 
earlier deadline of oct 1 at bentons request for more time 
ptl filed for bankruptcy protection in 1987 three months after 
bakker stepped aside over a sexual encounter with jessica hahn a 
church secretary 
donations to the ministry dwindled amid ensuing revelations about 
the luxurious lifestyle enjoyed by the bakkers

denied their basic human rights 
the estonian supreme soviet or parliament overwhelmingly passed 
a constitutional amendment wednesday requiring estonian approval of 
any new soviet law 
the parliament also approved a declaration of sovereignty 
asserting estonias independence in all areas except defense and 
foreign affairs 
on their way to moscow estonian leaders expressed satisfaction 
with a constitutional amendment reserving the right to review all 
new soviet laws and said they were prepared to argue the issue with 
the kremlin 
perestroika is a hope and democracy is a hope and every hope 
has a moment of unease the newly elected estonian premier indrek 
toome said during a flight from tallinn to moscow 
the dialogue has begun said igor grazin the estonian lawyer 
who wrote the amendment and will defend it before the federal 
supreme soviets presidium the highest executive body in the soviet 
union 
the estonian parliament made its challenge under the banner of 
the reform effort president mikhail s gorbachev calls perestroika 
the challenge illustrates gorbachevs continuing serious problems 
with rising ethnic feelings that if successful could spread to 
other areas 
moscows first reaction thursday was measured but deeply 
skeptical 
taking into consideration that the amendment and a number of 
other documents adopted by the estonian parliament are at variance 
with the provisions of the current constitution of the ussr the 
presidium of the ussr supreme soviet has decided to consider the 
abovementioned issue at its next meeting with representatives of 
the estonian republic to be invited the tass news agency reported 
the presidium is the soviet governments highest executive 
authority and gorbachev serves as its chairman 
tass said committees of the national supreme soviet were ordered 
to prepare an analysis of the issue which it said affects the 
initial principles of the building and unity of the soviet socialist 
federation 
it did not say when the meeting would take place but presumably 
it would be before the national parliament goes into session again 
nov 29 
residents of the westwardlooking baltic republics have been 
pushing for greater economic and cultural freedom from moscow under 
gorbachevs reform policy thousands of people in lithuania estonia 
and latvia have joined the grassroots peoples front organization 
some members say privately their ultimate goal is secession from the 
soviet union 
the baltics have been angered by amendments to the national 
constitution proposed by gorbachev saying they would shift the 
little power they have to moscow and eliminate their constitutional 
right to secede 
the three republics were independent countries between the world 
wars and were annexed by the soviet union in 1940 following a 1939 
pact between the soviets and the nazis 
there have been signs of kremlin impatience with the baltics 
politburo member alexander n yakovlev believed to be gorbachevs 
closest adviser said in an interview last month that they will not 
be allowed to take any major steps toward independence 
in another sign of the kremlins concern three politburo members 
were sent to the baltics last week to urge them to tone down their 
nationalism former kgb chief viktor m chebrikov criticized the 
estonian communist party for encouraging nationalism 
the lithuanian parliament met thursday in a session that will 
take up a declaration of lithuanian as the republics official 
language and other legislation following estonias example 
but alexander gelbaf deputy editor of the official newspaper 
sovietskaya litva said in a telephone interview that the parliament 
took up only budgetary matters 
he said the constitutional questions would be debated in a 
session beginning friday 
as in estonia the session was televised from start to finish 
thousands of lithuanians rallied wednesday night outside the 
supreme soviet building in vilnius the capital and hundreds more 
waited outside the parliament building throughout the day thursday 
said veleya terleckiene 
ms terleckiene daughter of anastas terleckas a leader of the 
separatist lithuanian liberty league said they carried flags of 
formerly independent lithuania and banners supporting lithuanian 
autonomy 
she said the entire republic including members of the communist 
party supported the intiatives of sajudis the lithuanian peoples 
front to be debated friday by the parliament

a robot named manny joined the 
us army on thursday to test soldiers clothing against agents used 
in chemical warfare 
the 28 million mansized mannequin capable of walking 
crouching breathing and perspiring is fitted with sensors to 
immediately detect penetration of up to onebillionth of an ounce of 
chemical agent through the clothing it wears 
this is the kind of information it has been extremely difficult 
to obtain in the past said dr lothar salomon scientific 
director at this sprawling army post in the western utah desert 
salomon who came up with the idea of using a robot in 1985 said 
such tests had been conducted primarily with simulants until now 
the answers from these tests are not the same as the answers 
you get from real chemical agents he said manny was 
definitely something we felt we had to have 
the 5foot11 robot was developed by battelles pacific northwest 
laboratories in richland wash which provided robotics for the 
department of energy for handling of radioactive materials 
salomon said the cost of the robot would likely ensure it will be 
one of a kind at least for the testing of protective clothing worn 
by all branches of the military which is performed at dugway 
the design is governmentowned but he said government approval 
of commercial sales would be a mere formality 
unable to balance itself the robot hangs from a mechanical arm 
located in the small of its back the robots work is performed 
within a hermetically sealed environment and is controlled by 
computers 
reporters were given a demonstration in which manny performed 
toetouches crouched walked duckwalked and kicked a ball dropped 
from his hand 
i hope you enjoyed my demonstration manny said with a 
farewell wave 
during tests he would perform similar exercises while wearing 
protective gear in an environment contaminated with chemical agents 
manny can walk at 3 mph movement is provided by rotary and 
linear hydraulic actuators placed at each of his 38 joints 
a clear plastic covers the skeleton giving the robot a human 
shape the plastic will be covered by a thick skin of butyl rubber 
which will carry the chemical agent detectors 
perspiration is simulated by injecting water through capillary 
tubes to the surface of the rubber skin breathing is simulated by 
the expansion and contraction of the chest at variable rates 
moist air is injected at the nose and mouth to simulate 
exhalation 
manny can be decontaminated after a test without anyone entering 
the controlled environment 
battelle borrowed ideas for mannys arm from the robotic michael 
jackson performing at disney world said david w bennett a 
battelle technical group leader for mechanical systems and robotics 
manny is the result of a general realization that chemical 
warfare is a continuing concern salomon said what we issue to 
the troops we have to have a high degree of confidence is the best 
available

presidentelect george bush on thursday named 
new hampshire gov john sununu as white house chief of staff and 
tapped wily campaign strategist lee atwater as chairman of the 
republican national committee 
bushs selection of sununu as his top white house adviser 
prompted craig l fuller to reveal that he would quit working for 
bush after the transition ends in january 
fuller said he informed bush last month he would accept no post 
other than chief of staff fuller told the associated press that 
bush had let him know on election day that he was giving that job to 
sununu 
bush said he would like fuller cochairman of the transition 
team and his chief of staff since 1985 to consider a role in his 
administration but that he chose sununu because he was the right 
man for the job 
john sununu has the background and experience necessary to work 
not only with his former colleagues in the nations statehouses but 
also to build a constructive relationship with the us congress 
he said 
sununu the first washington outsider to be named by bush will 
bring a refreshing new perspective to the job the 
presidentelect said 
atwater will succeed frank fahrenkopf jr who announced months 
ago that he would relinquish the gop chairmanship at the end of 
president reagans term and return to nevada to practice law 
bush said atwaters function will be winning elections while 
republicans have won the presidency in five of the last six 
elections they have been less successful at the congressional 
level where democrats hold comfortable majorities 
im a nutsandbolts politician atwater said i will be 
extremely campaign oriented 
the republican national committee will formally act on bushs 
choice in january 
bush made the announcements after meeting over breakfast with 
british prime minister margaret thatcher and his customary weekly 
lunch with reagan also on his schedule thursday was an evening 
centennial banquet of the national geographic society 
both sununu and atwater share reputations as adept players of 
political hardball 
atwater is considered a master of negative campaigning and was 
an architect of the strategy that helped bush wipe out a 17point 
poll lead by democrat michael dukakis and romp to a 40state victory 
in the presidential race 
sununu 49 an engineer by training and a former tufts university 
professor has no previous experience in washington he has a 
reputation for being a quick study highly intelligent and 
assertive some also regard him as arrogant and abrasive traits 
that could hurt him in working with congress 
sununu made light of that reputation thursday 
im a pussycat sununu said let me tell you about 
washington certainly i have a lot to learn in regard to the 
details i think im a quick learner i consider a great number of 
congressmen to be close friends both democratic and republican 
jewish lobbyists have criticized the new hampshire governor for 
being the only governor to refuse to endorse a proclamation 
attacking a 1975 un resolution that equated zionism with racism 
im very sensitive to that issue said sununu who is partly 
of arab descent 
the problem i had as a governor is that i felt it was 
inappropriate in terms of the issue i have no problem saying it 
should be repudiated 
he acknowledged that he was a considered a conservative 
republican governor and had no intention of changing his political 
philosophy but he promised to be a honest broker and consider 
both sides of an issue 
sununu had declined to run for a fourth term as governor citing 
a need to return to the real world to get a real job he and his 
wife nancy have eight children 
he is credited with helping revive bushs candidacy with a 
victory in the new hampshire primary last february after the vice 
president finished a poor third in iowas caucuses 
atwater 37 was a chief architect of bushs winning campaign a 
native of south carolina atwater was a white house aide to 
president reagan and also worked for sen strom thurmond of south 
carolina 
on other matters 
bush was asked about a report that he would meet with mexicos 
presidentelect carlos salinas if i were to have a meeting with 
the incoming president of mexico it would be to symbolize the 
importance i place on the relationship with mexico 
he said the cia would be an intelligence agency and would 
not be making policy 
after her meeting with bush mrs thatcher described him as a 
leader with a very very wide knowledge who needs no 
introduction to foreign affairs but she said she told him a fresh 
approach was needed in the middle east 
bush was scheduled to make a quick trip friday morning to 
charlottesville va for a private meeting with the executive 
committee of the national governors association sununu a past 
chairman of the association also will attend 
the presidentelect was then flying back immediately to 
washington reportedly for a luncheon date with house speaker jim 
wright 
bush has already named two longtime friends james a baker iii 
and nicholas f brady as the cornerstone members of his cabinet as 
secretaries of state and treasury respectively brady replaced 
baker at treasury after baker quit in august to become bushs 
campaign chairman

foreign minister shimon peres spearheading an 
israeli damage control drive accused the plo on thursday of 
deceiving the world by claiming it moderated its positions at the 
palestine national council meeting 
we feel very strongly that under the headline of moderation 
what really happened is a more extreme position taken by the pnc 
he told foreign reporters at a news conference 
the council which acts as the legislature of yasser arafats 
palestine liberation organization declared an independent 
palestinian state tuesday at the end of a fourday session in 
algiers capital of algeria 
as of thursday 25 nations had recognized the palestinian state 
president corazon aquino said in manila that the philippines was 
considering recognition 
delegates at algiers also implictly recognized israel and said 
the council would limit guerrilla operations to military targets in 
israelioccupied territories 
peres head of the leftleaning labor party said the councils 
declaration of a palestinian state further sabotaged the middle east 
peace process 
i see an attempt to throw a stone into a structure of glass 
the peace process so delicate so breakable peres said he 
said the final status of the occupied west bank and gaza strip must 
be negotiated in peace talks 
israeli ambassadors sought meetings with foreign ministers in 
various host countries to explain israels position and prevent 
recognition of the new state 
we are trying to have some damage control he said 
israel is also working out a joint strategy with the united 
states to keep the palestinian state from being accredited as an 
observer nation in the united nations peres said 
he said the outgoing israeli government deeply divided on peace 
issues stood united in its rejection of the plo positions isnt 
it your impression that we have the same position for a change 
peres said when asked if he was stating government policy 
he argued that the palestinians at algiers rejected the three 
conditions posed by america for talks with the plo recognition of 
israel renunciation of terror and acceptance of un security 
council resolutions 242 and 338 
resolution 338 in one major provision calls for negotiations 
between the parties for a just and durable peace in the middle 
east 
resolution 242 adopted earlier after the 1967 mideast war asks 
israel to withdraw from captured territory and declares the right of 
all states in the region to exist within secure borders 
in accepting 242 the algiers meeting coupled it with the right 
of the palestinian people to selfdetermination 
peres argued that by adding phrases the council perverted the 
meaning of the resolution 
he also discounted interpretations that the plo implicitly 
recognized israel by declaring a palestinian state based on the 1947 
un partition plan which calls for a jewish and an arab state side 
by side in palestine 
israel is not an implicit state you either recognize it or 
you dont peres said 
state department spokesman charles redman had said in washington 
wednesday that implicit recognition was insufficient recognition 
must be clear and unambiguous he said 
peres also claimed the plo had not renounced terrorism 
in a statement in reply to written questions submitted by 
reporters mrs aquino hailed a political declaration by the council 
on the un resolutions as a positive development not only for the 
philippines but for the whole world 
the philippines depends on the middle east for most of its oil 
needs and sends thousands of workers to arab countries each year 
nations which recognized the palestinian state are afghanistan 
algeria bahrain bangladesh india indonesia iraq jordan 
kuwait libya madagascar malaysia mauritania morocco nicaragua 
north yemen south yemen qatar pakistan saudi arabia sudan 
tunisia turkey the united arab emirates and yugoslavia 
the egyptian daily alahram said cuba zambia and somalia also 
recognized the palestinian state but cited no source

thursday the board had made its decision monday

the majority in the ruling

the general assembly passed its annual 
resolution thursday urging britain and argentina to open 
negotiations on the sovereignty of the falkland islands over which 
they fought a 74day war in 1982 
the vote in the 159member assembly was 1095 with 37 
abstentions last year it was 1145 with 36 abstentions 
britain which won the war by driving an argentine invasion force 
out of the south atlantic archipelago cast its customary vote 
against the resolution but the united states voted in favor 
sir crispen tickell the british ambassador declared during 
debate we are not ready to enter into negotiations on all aspects 
of the future of the falkland islands that would mean the beginning 
of negotiations which would represent the method by which argentina 
would recover sovereignty 
the british government will continue to uphold the right of the 
falkland islanders to self determination he said but that does 
not mean there is nothing else to talk about 
tickell cited fishing as a possible area of agreement with 
argentina which calls the islands the malvinas and claims to have 
inherited the archipelago from spain in 1810 britain has ruled the 
islands since 1833 
about 1000 men were lost on both sides in the war most of them 
when the british sank the argentine cruise general belgrano 
argentina has not yet declared a formal end to hostilities and 
diplomatic relations have not been restored 
about 2000 people live on the islands most are fishermen or 
raise sheep

many animal acts gebelwilliams now performs alone 
its the most difficult thing ive ever had to deal with 
feld said once in a lifetime theres a gunther gebelwilliams 
gebelwilliams was born in the german town of schweidnitz which 
is now a part of poland and was 12 years old when his widowed 
mother was hired by circus williams as a wardrobe seamstress

a chilean envoy on thursday 
attacked a human rights report that accuses his countrys military 
of burning two civilians with gasoline and questions chiles 
progress toward democracy 
the report by the interamerican human rights commission focuses 
on human rights abuses in latin america and also singles out cuba 
el salvador guatemala nicaragua and paraguay 
delegates of 31 nations in the organization of american states 
received the report during their meeting wednesday in san salvador 
the commission declared the chilean government of gen augusto 
pinochet responsible for the death of rodrigo rojas and grave 
injuries of carmen gloria quintana when they were burned by a 
military patrol in july 1986 
according to the report the soldiers doused the pair with 
gasoline set them on fire and left them at the roadside 
the military said the two were throwing firebombs but human 
rights groups and relatives of ms quintana and rojas said they were 
innocent bystanders the case has attracted international attention 
the report also said pinochets defeat in a yesorno 
presidential referendum on oct 5 represented a positive fact 
however it said the loss does not imply the installment of an 
authentic democratic system 
pinochet who came to power in a september 1973 coup lost his 
bid to extend his presidency until 1997 the opposition is calling 
for early elections to end military rule 
chiles oas ambassador javier illanes said the commission had 
not given chile credit for trying to end abuses 
it seems to us the commission was only interested in negative 
aspects and didnt give importance to the progress of democracy 
he said 
the report also criticized communistruled cuba where it said 
political prisoners received long sentences under harsh prison 
conditions there was no immediate reaction from cuban officials 
in el salvador the report found an increase in the activities 
of the socalled death squads that stalk victims for political 
ends 
however benjamin cestoni president of the salvadoran 
governments human rights commission said thursday the report was 
unfair because it failed to reflect the damage from terrorist 
groups 
el salvador has been using us support to fight a nineyear 
civil war against leftist guerrillas 
in nicaragua the commission reported advances although 
precarious stemming from a march ceasefire pact between the 
leftist sandinista government and usbacked rebels who fought for 
seven years 
but the commission criticized the sandinistas for repression of 
an opposition demonstration in july and serious violations of the 
rights of several opposition activists 
deputy foreign minister victor hugo tinoco of nicaragua said his 
government was satisfied because the report reflected the 
difficulties imposed by the civil war 
the oas general assembly will vote saturday on whether to accept 
the report 
sonia sgambatti president of the groups interamerican 
commission for the control of drug abuse also told delegates to the 
conference thursday that drugs are the biggest criminal problem in 
the history of the western hemisphere 
she credited several nations including the united states 
colombia bolivia and mexico for their antidrug efforts during the 
past year 
sgambatti also called for quicker extradition of drug suspects 
among member nations

prime minister brian mulroney desperately needs 
to sweep his native province of quebec to win a majority government 
monday and preserve the free trade agreement he signed with 
president reagan 
pressed hard by opposition allegations that he sold canada out 
mulroney has promoted the deal as the passport to prosperity an 
instrument of economic expansion 
he tells crowds the choice is a simple one between john the 
ripper liberal party leader john turner and brian the 
builder 
mulroney strives to portray turner as an antiamerican who 
opposes progress and points to the prosperity of his four years in 
office 
the cause of my life is to build a nation he says 
ed broadbent leader of the socialist new democratic party said 
reagans remarks thursday about the free trade agreement will hurt 
mulroney 
it will remind every canadian how close brian mulroney is to 
ronald reagan said broadbent whose party is expected to finish 
third it will remind every canadian the americans got virtually 
everything they wanted in this deal 
reagan said in a speech to the us chamber of commerce in 
washington as far as the united states is concerned the free 
trade agreement is an example of cooperation at its best it is a 
testament to the commitment of our two governments to the principles 
of the open market and to economic cooperation 
opponents of the agreement had said the reagan speech could be 
interpreted as interference in canadian affairs 
mulroneys progressive conservative party must win 148 of the 295 
seats to ensure the agreement takes effect jan 1 eliminating 
tariffs between the worlds two largest trading partners over a 
10year period 
it has been approved by congress but has yet to be considered by 
parliament 
quebec has 75 seats in the house of commons second only as a 
bloc to the 99 seats of ontario where opposition is stronger 
the free trade debate has dominated the campaign since mulroney 
dissolved parliament on oct 1 
at the time he appeared headed for an easy victory the 
liberals long a dominant force in canadian politics had sagged to 
what seemed to be a battle with the new democrats for runnerup 
status 
but in a matter of weeks turners persistent attacks on the free 
trade agreement as a threat to canadian sovereignty and identity 
have revived his chances polls indicate that more canadians oppose 
the agreement than support it 
the polls also put the liberals and progressive conservatives in 
a dead heat 
support for free trade has been strongest in frenchspeaking 
quebec secure in its cultural identity but turner has by no means 
conceded the province 
the opposition leader was in montreal on wednesday night and 
charged the prime minister is willing to sacrifice textile workers 
garment workers food workers and farmers on the altar of free 
trade 
at mulroneys major campaign rally wednesday night in a working 
class district of east montreal protesters signs read mulroney 
for governor of the 51st state and canada for the canadians 
the prime minister responded with the shout that the pact is 
good for quebec and it is good for canada 
mulroney is expected to do well throughout rural quebec because 
of its strong cultural identity there is little reason to fear the 
pact could bring in an overwhelming us presence 
the province also has a strong entrepreneurial bent that has 
helped fuel prosperity in the 1980s quebecs prime minister robert 
bourassa is a leading supporter of the free trade agreement even 
though he is a liberal 
but polls indicate montreal will be more hotly contested that the 
rest of the province 
during his campaign mulroney has spoken of the 175000 new jobs 
in montreal since his landslide victory in 1984 345000 new jobs in 
the province and 13 million new jobs across canada 
mulroney comes from a working class background in baiecomeau on 
quebecs north shore he is the first frenchspeaking quebecer to 
lead the conservative party and is greeted here with shouts of 
brian brian

diabetics who are able to control their 
bloodsugar levels well are much more likely to keep their eyesight 
than those whose levels are poorly controlled a study to be 
published friday suggests 
thousands of people with diabetes go blind each year because of a 
condition linked to the disease called retinopathy in which tiny 
blood vessels at the back of the eye break and bleed usually 
painlessly and over a period of years 
the condition afflicts both people who get diabetes as adults and 
those who get it at younger ages say researchers at the university 
of wisconsin who studied both groups over a fouryear interval 
more than 1800 diabetics participated in the study 
the researchers used blood sugarlevels to divide subjects into 
four categories and found that those in the highestlevel category 
developed signs of retinopathy almost twice as often as subjects in 
the lowest category 
this was true of all subjects taking insulin whether they got 
the disease before or after age 30 the researchers reported in 
fridays journal of the american medical association 
insulin usually administered by injection helps the body use 
sugar and other carbohydrates 
olderonset diabetics those developing the disease at or over 
age 30 who were not taking insulin showed an even greater 
disparity with retinopathy appearing four times as often among the 
highest bloodsugar category compared with the lowest the 
researchers found 
dr barbara ek klein professor of ophthalmology and a 
coauthor of the study said thursday it suggests that 
nonhospitalized people with higher levels are at higher risk 
but the study is too preliminary to use as a basis for changing 
the way people manage bloodsugar levels because tighter controls 
can lead to serious medical complications she said 
still the findings suggest that even a modest improvement of 
blood sugar control may reduce the incidence of proliferative 
advancing retinopathy signficantly they said 
for example the fouryear risk of developing advancing 
retinopathy among people with an 11 percent reading for glycosylated 
hemoglobin a bloodsugar test was estimated to be roughly double 
that of people with a reading of 9 percent they said 
regardless of bloodsugar levels 59 percent of the youngeronset 
diabetics developed some signs of retinopathy over the fouryear 
period the researchers said in the olderonset group taking 
insulin the rate was 474 percent in the olderonset group not 
taking insulin the rate was 344 percent the researchers said 
in an editorial accompanying the study drs michael p stern and 
steven m haffner of the university of texas health science center 
at san antonio said the new findings provide persuasive evidence 
that bloodsugar control is positively associated with the risk of 
developing initial or advancing retinopathy

a landlady suspected of killing seven 
elderly tenants at her boardinghouse to collect their social 
security money said thursday she had cashed some checks but was no 
killer 
dorothea montalvo puente who vanished saturday after police 
unearthed the first body buried in her yard was arraigned thursday 
but did not enter a plea 
clad in an orange jail jumpsuit puente listened quietly as the 
charge of one murder count was read and nodded her head to indicate 
she wanted a public defender to represent her 
assistant district attorney dan kinter said additional murder 
charges and special circumstances would be filed special 
circumstances mean the penalty upon conviction could be death or 
life in prison without possibility of parole 
the case was continued until dec 15 and she was ordered held in 
jail without bail 
puente 59 was arrested at a downtown los angeles motel late 
wednesday after a pensioner she had approached in a bar became 
suspicious 
assistant public defenders kevin clymo and peter vlautin 
surrounded by dozens of reporters outside the courtroom questioned 
the propriety of an interview puente gave kcratv while the jet 
leased by the station was taking her and police back to sacramento 
early thursday 
i have not killed anyone i told you that i have not killed 
anyone the checks i cashed yes puente told kcratv reporter 
mike boyd 
boyd said he didnt ask specific questions about the murders but 
only talked with puente about general subjects she also told boyd 
i used to be a very good person at one time 
its unheard of that a law enforcement agency would team up 
with a news organization to transport a person to jail vlautin 
said 
puente was put on the jet with detectives and the television crew 
with no opportunity to talk to anybody who had her interests in 
mind clymo said at this time i do not believe she was 
given an opportunity to talk to a lawyer before the flight 
our client denies killing anybody the true facts will come out 
in the courtroom said vlautin the sacramento police department 
has enlisted the aid of the media to create a circus atmosphere 
police chief john kearns said he did not learn about the jet 
arrangements until thursday morning 
the matronly exconvict walked away from her boarding house 
saturday morning after the first body was unearthed by officers 
at that time police said they didnt have enough evidence to 
detain her but after the other bodies were discovered a murder 
warrant was issued for puente and a search launched in california 
nevada and mexico 
police chief john kearns said she apparently went to west 
sacramento on saturday then took a cab to stockton where she 
boarded a bus for los angeles and has probably been there since 
that time 
puente was arrested after cbs television told los angeles police 
that a viewer called to report meeting her in a downtown bar she 
had given the man the name and room number of the motel where she 
was staying and police arrested her there a few minutes later 
the suspect had struck up a conversation with a male subject in 
a bar they had been talking about social security kearns said 
the two went to her nearby motel room and during the time he was 
talking to her he realized it was the murder suspect he had seen on 
television 
she was real cool real calm it looked like she almost 
expected it sgt paul von lutzow said 
the man charles willgues 67 said he became suspicious after 
puente who called herself donna johanson quizzed him about his 
social security benefits 
she seemed so nice and sincere she really was very 
believable willgues said she told me she needed her shoe 
fixed and if i knew where i could get that done thats how our 
conversation got started 
willgues who receives social security and other disability 
benefits because of two strokes and other ailments said puente 
asked him where he got his money and then suggested that they share 
an apartment 
she made a whole lot of talk about those checks willgues 
said 
i kept looking at the woman something just didnt seem right 
i felt like i had seen her before willgues added explaining why 
he called the television network 
los angeles police searched the motel room but found only three 
dresses said detective jim turner 
the arrest warrant charges puente only with the murder of alvaro 
montoya 52 a tenant missing from her boardinghouse but police 
sgt bob burns earlier called puente a suspect in the killing of all 
seven people buried in her yard none of the seven have been 
positively identified 
the disappearance of montoya a mentally disabled transient led 
a counselor with volunteers of america to contact police leading to 
the diggings 
police believe puente killed tenants of her eightbedroom 
boardinghouse for their social security benefits they have a list 
of two dozen people who are missing and who might have lived there 
at one time or another 
puente has a criminal record dating to a 1948 conviction for 
forging checks she served 2 years in state prison in the 1980s for 
drugging and robbing three men she met in a sacramento bar and she 
is still on parole for a separate federal forgery conviction

presidentelect george bush said thursday he 
will hold a preinaugural visit with mexicos incoming president and 
promised not to take unilateral actions on issues affecting that 
countrys wellbeing 
bush made the pledge in a letter he sent to the bilateral 
commission on the future of united statesmexican relations which 
issued a report containing a series of recommendations on solving 
crossborder problems 
bushs deputy national security adviser col sam watson 
presented the letter to commission members on receiving a copy of 
the 238page report the commission comprised of prominent mexican 
and us citizens spent two years preparing the report 
among other recommendations the report said unilateral measures 
must be avoided on issues affecting the two countries 
i fully agree that two new administrations taking office at 
about the same time gives us tremendous opportunities to work 
together bush said in the letter 
one hallmark of my administration will be close consultations 
and a bilateral approach to problemsolving your report will be of 
great use in the future the effort was well worth it 
at a news conference earlier bush appeared taken aback when 
asked about reports he will hold a getacquainted meeting tuesday in 
houston with his mexican counterpart carlos salinas de gortari who 
will take office dec 1 
he stopped short of confirming the encounter would take place but 
said that any such meeting would symbolize the importance he 
places on relations with our front yard neighbors 
but bush then quickly launched into an explanation of what he 
hopes to accomplish from such an early gettogether 
when and if such a meeting is announced i will address myself 
to the question bush told reporters but if i were to have a 
meeting with the incoming president of mexico before he is sworn in 
on dec 1 while i am still in transition it would be to symbolize 
the importance i place on the relationship with mexico 
bush added i know something about that relationship and i have 
met with his two predecessors 
if such a meeting takes place it will symbolize the 
importance of our front yard our neighbors he said 
the vice presidents office late thursday night confirmed that 
bush and salinas would meet and have lunch at the johnson space 
center in houston next week 
their meeting symbolizes the close relationship of our two 
countries and the vice presidents high respect for mexico it is 
intended to further develop a close consultative relationship and a 
bilateral approach to problem solving said bush spokesman steve 
hart 
salinas victory in the july 6 election was clouded only on 
wednesday did the main opposition party the conservative national 
action party end its fight to overturn the results 
the opposition still maintained that salinas party the ruling 
institutional revolutionary party won as a result of fraud the 
ruling party has not lost a presidential election since its founding 
in 1929 
bush made the comment during a meeting with reporters to announce 
his selection of john sununu as chief of staff he such a meeting 
with salinas would not be official 
i am not going to try to act like a president before jan 20th 
and take over the foreign affairs responsibilities from this 
president he said i dont want to do that 
but he added it would a simpler thing to work out such a 
meeting now before we are both sworn in salinas is to be begin 
his term dec 1 
bush will reportedly stop in point clear ark to speak at a 
republican governors meeting tuesday before heading to houston he 
is planning to depart from washington wednesday for a thanksgiving 
holiday stay at his oceanfront home in kennebunkport maine

more than 10000 people marched in 
subfreezing weather to protest the resignations thursday of the 
kosovo communist party president and another top official in this 
restive province 
it was believed to be the biggest protest in kosovo since bloody 
riots in 1981 
some estimates put the crowd at 20000 
kacusa jasari president of the kosovo communist party and azem 
vlasi her predecessor and a member of the powerful party presidium 
announced their resignations at a meeting of the provincial 
communist leadership thursday 
the presidium approved both resignations the state tanjug news 
agency reported it said remzi koljgeci also an ethnic albanian 
would act as president until the next session no date was given 
the two ethnic albanian leaders were the main target of 
resignation demands by slobodan milosevic communist party chief of 
the serbian republic in his drive to bring kosovo under tighter 
serbian control 
protesters marched through pristina kosovos capital chanting 
support for jasari and vlasi and bearing portraits of the late 
president jozip broz tito 
they chanted unity fraternity long live kacusa 
jasari we shall not yield azem vlasi and slogans against 
milosevic 
jasari and vlasi addressed protesters packed into a sports hall 
reassuring them the two would stay in the top leadership and 
appealing for peace 
jasari said she would step down as head of the 13member kosovo 
presidium but would remain a member of the body tanjug reported 
vlasi announced his resignation from the kosovo presidium in 
compliance with a recent decision of the federal party presidium 
prohibiting its central committee members from simultaneously 
holding membership in local party bodies tanjug said vlasi is on 
the national party central committee 
the resignations brought to seven the number of top kosovo party 
leaders who said they were stepping down after serbian and 
provincial communist leaders clashed at a meeting this month over 
serbian demands for a purge of kosovos ruling elite 
milosevic has been backed by rallies attended by hundreds of 
thousands of serbs in recent months 
slavs in kosovo claim they are being harassed and forced to 
emigrate by the ethnic albanian majority 
although administratively part of serbia kosovo enjoys wide 
autonomy under yugoslavias 1974 constitution which was adopted 
under tito and created a loose confederation of six republics and 
two provinces 
the constitution is seen by many as a main cause of yugoslavias 
present ethnic and economic woes since it leaves central power weak 
the march and a demonstration thursday by about 4000 miners 
indicated the kosovo party leadership enjoys wide support among 
ethnic albanians who make up about 90 percent of kosovos 
population the miners marched to pristina from the titova mitrovica 
lead mines 31 miles away to protest the resignations 
milosevics supporters have repeatedly claimed the kosovo party 
leadership lacks majority support 
they said the provincial leadership could not cope with albanian 
nationalism left simmering since 1981 when ethnic clashes left at 
least nine people dead 
according to tanjug windows were shattered at the offices of the 
belgradebased daily vecernje novosti but no other incidents were 
reported 
by about 10 pm most of the crowd had dispersed 
in another development thursday workers of the countrys major 
cotton yarn manufacturer djuro salaj of mostar in western 
yugoslavia walked out demanding a 60 percent pay increase tanjug 
reported 
the plant employs about 6000 workers average monthly salary for 
a worker is about 61

students at meadowdale high school thought a 
classmate was the crown prince of morocco until police learned that 
the sporty red car he drove was stolen and he didnt have his royal 
fathers telephone number to call for help 
michael w taylor 28 of louisville ky was in 
daytonmontgomery county jail after being charged wednesday in ohio 
with receiving stolen property a kentucky grand jury on thursday 
indicted him on two counts of theft by deception 
students say the flashy foreignexchange student they knew as 
17yearold prince sparkle shannon dressed in the latest fashions 
and wore gold jewelry around his neck and a diamond ring he spurned 
school buses in favor of a red 1988 dodge daytona car and reportedly 
once rented a chauffeured limousine to take him to a meadowdale 
football game 
i cant believe it said freshman shamika bohanon he could 
dress it seemed like he had on a different pair of shoes every 
day 
taylor was the subject of an article in the school newspaper and 
during a recent lecture for the student leadership club told 
students he would inherit the moroccan throne when king hassan ii 
died he also told students he had studied with the kgb in the 
soviet union last year school officials said 
but the royal act began to unravel monday when madison township 
police detective rick wright spotted taylors car which was bearing 
kentucky license plates in the school parking lot he ran a check 
and learned it had been stolen 
wright said he and other police officers waited until taylor got 
into the car with a female companion and then stopped the vehicle 
do you know who that is wright said the girl told the 
officers thats the prince of morocco 
wright said at that point school officials and security guards 
confronted them 
that kid is the prince of morocco wright quoted one school 
official as saying what are you going to do to him youre going 
to start an international incident right here in our parking lot 
wright said he took taylor into the school and found that he knew 
the capital of morocco the name of the prime minister and even the 
date of the countrys independence day but the officer said taylor 
had no passport or immigration card 
he was talking in a very middle eastern accent wright 
recalled he quoted taylor as telling school officials you mean 
to tell me you let murderers go free in this country and youre 
going to let them lock me up for this 
wright said he then asked taylor to call his father on the 
telephone 
the king taylor asked 
wright said he took taylor into custody after he said he left his 
fathers phone number at home 
montgomery county sheriffs detective bob weaver said taylor who 
stands about 5 feet 6 inches and weighs about 110 pounds told 
police his name was monlay rashid 
but weaver said everything changed when taylor discovered police 
knew his real identity 
he was confronted with that and basically he finally admitted 
to being michael taylor weaver said when we said more or 
less the games over thats when he finally lost his moroccan 
accent 
meadowdale principal ben kirby said taylor asked to enroll at the 
high school in september just days after classes had started 
taylor told school officials his father wanted him to go to school 
in ohio and that he liked dayton he was enrolled as a senior 
kirby said he became suspicious when the students high school 
transcripts never arrived the principal said taylor had said he had 
been staying with a host family by the name of flagg but he had no 
additional information 
louisville police detective ron schultz said he arrested taylor 
last may on charges of obtaining a car under false pretenses 
schultz said at that time taylor gave his name as nakita vandiest 
shepard 
hes nothing but a con artist all indication is that he is 
schultz said he expects taylor to face numerous additional charges 
in kentucky 
the charges taylor faces in dayton stem from the theft of a dodge 
daytona from a louisville car dealership last spring 
taylor could be sentenced to one to two years in prison and fined 
up to 5000 if convicted in vandalia municipal court on the charge 
of receiving stolen property he was being held in the dayton jail 
in lieu of 7500 cash bond 
he also could be sentenced to one to five years on each count of 
theft by deception

the general assembly on thursday 
overwhelmingly demanded that south africa grant independence to 
southwest africa regardless of the presence of 50000 cuban troops 
in neighboring angola 
the demand was part of a package of five resolutions that ask for 
sanctions to punish south africa for ruling southwest africa also 
known as namibia and a program to implement the sanctions and press 
for independence 
a procession of 71 speakers came to the podium in debate that ran 
from monday through thursday to castigate south africa for occupying 
southwest africa in defiance of un resolutions 
not one nation voted against any of the proposals although the 
united states western europe japan israel australia and new 
zealand abstained on some south africa was stripped of its voting 
rights in the united nations in 1974 
us ambassador vernon a walters said the united states 
abstained to maintain its neutrality while mediating peace talks 
among south africa cuba and angola 
south african cuban and angolan negotiators tentatively agreed 
this week during talks in geneva that the cubans will leave angola 
and south africa will allow the united nations to begin a oneyear 
independence plan for southwest africa 
if their governments ratify the accord the namibian idependence 
process could begin early in 1989 
cuban troops have been in angola since 1975 to defend that 
countrys marxist government from raids by the unita rebel movement 
the national union for the total independence of angola and its 
ally south africa 
south africa has ruled namibia for 73 years since germany lost 
the former colony during world war i the league of nations the 
united nations predecessor subsequently granted south africa a 
mandate to administer namibia 
in 1966 the united nations revoked the mandate in 1978 the 
security council passed resolution 435 a oneyear plan to set up a 
constituent assembly to adopt a constitution and organize an 
independent goverment 
the resolutions passed thursday call south africas occupation an 
act of aggression and demand prisonerofwar treatment for 
captured members of the southwest african peoples organization 
swapo the guerrilla group fighting for independence 
swapo is designated in the resolutions as the sole and 
authentic representative of the namibian people for years swapo 
has held nonvoting observer status in the united nations 
walters told the assembly that america objects to that 
characterization and said only free and democratic elections 
will provide the namibian people themselves the opportunity to 
choose whom they want as their representative 
the resolutions also call for mandantory economic sanctions 
against south africa a step that britain and the united states have 
blocked before in the security council by using their veto power

kohl told the north atlantic assembly that west germany acts as 
host to more than 400000 allied soldiers on its soil and will 
continue to fulfill its nato obligations 
but he added we should also not overtax one another and 
thereby conjure up the danger that acceptance of the alliance could 
be damaged 
kohl a staunch supporter of the united states has recently been 
emphasizing that west germans hesitate to accept greater financial 
burdens within nato 
on thursday he broadened that message to include other nations 
in the western european alliance 
his speech came amid growing sentiment in washington that nato 
allies in western europe should shoulder a greater defense burden 
west germans however argue that other kinds of national 
contributions to nato should be taken into account they say they 
should get credit for putting up with military hardware and soldiers 
on their territory 
the chancellor ruled out removing nato shortrange nuclear 
weapons deployed in west germany us officials worry pressure to 
scrap the weapons could mount among west germans who view the soviet 
union as a decreasing military threat

riot police swung clubs and fired tear gas 
thursday at hundreds of anarchists who hurled sticks and stones at 
them outside the us embassy witnesses said 
police said they made at least 10 arrests no injuries were 
reported 
the anarchists arrived at the embassy at the conclusion of a 
march by 20000 demonstrators who were marking the 15th anniversary 
of a student uprising against the 196774 military dictatorship in 
greece 
the peaceful march started at polytechnic university site of the 
nov 17 1973 rebellion which was crushed by troops and tanks it 
ended at the fenced embassy compound on vasillis sophias avenue a 
main boulevard where protesters shouted americans murderers of 
the people get out now 
after march participants left the embassy area the anarchists 
began to battle police 
more than 20 young people were killed in the 1973 student 
uprising which is credited with triggering the military regimes 
collapse 
the annual march to the us embassy reflects a widely held 
belief that us support enabled the colonels to remain in power 
the demonstrators chanted slogans urging premier andreas 
papandreous socialist government to remove four us military bases 
that have operated in greece since the early 1950s 
the polytechnic uprising anniversary is generally treated as a 
national holiday with politicans from all parties laying wreaths 
beside a sculpture dedicated to the slain youths 
but this year leading politicians including papandreou and 
constantinos mitsotakis leader of the main opposition new democracy 
party did not attend the commemorations

a car containing what authorities 
believed were the bodies of four young people missing since last 
weekend was found thursday on the bottom of a murky river police 
said 
a detour sign on the road incorrectly directs traffic to the dead 
end where the accident occurred a second sign warns of danger ahead 
the three women and one man ages 19 and 20 were last seen by 
their parents about 7 pm saturday when they left their hometown 
of east lyme for an evening in new haven 
autopsy reports were pending but police lt james sorrentino 
said it was likely the four victims were the missing young people 
the car approached an open swing bridge and went into the water 
over a barrier blocking the roadway sorrentino said others said 
the bridge which swings from side to side had been in an open 
position for several years 
several news reports quoting unnamed sources said no barriers 
were in place blocking the road on the night of the accident a 
service station owner said that a wooden barrier normally blocks the 
roadway which was cordoned off by police thursday 
i have no information either way sorrentino said ive 
been led to believe the barriers were always there 
a crane was used to pull the car from the water while some 
family members waited in a police van 
police have determined the four spent at least part of saturday 
night drinking illegally at a bar near yale university said state 
police detective andre trudelle an employee of the bar told 
authorities they left together about 3 am sunday trudelle said 
the legal drinking age in connecticut is 21 
they were good kids i cant picture them being drunk and 
driving said michelle funaioli who said she was at a new haven 
bar last thursday with michael gallo one of the missing 
the missing women were identified as jill sawyer 19 a student 
at the university of rhode island christy stevens 19 a student at 
mohegan community college in norwich and laura lagrotteria 19

police divers found the car submerged in about 15 feet of water 
in the mill river in a littletraveled old and industrial part of 
the city just north of the new haven harbor police said 
the bridge has been closed for several years because of roadwork 
in the area business owners said 
there were no skid marks at the scene and police said an 
investigation would determine if the car was speeding 
family and friends described the four former high school buddies 
as responsible adults unlikely to take off without telling anyone

military president augusto pinochet firmly 
rejected on thursday opposition calls for constitutional changes 
before chiles return to elected civilian rule in 1990 
he said the reforms urged by dissidents would undermine the 
basic structure of the constitution 
pinochets lameduck government had hinted this week at talks 
with the opposition that beat him in an oct 5 referendum on 
extending his rule until 1997 
in a speech at a luncheon with supporters in punta arenas 1550 
miles south of santiago pinochet said his rightwing government is 
prepared for a constructive exchange of ideas with the 
opposition but within the present legislation 
the opposition under the pretext of improving the 
constitution aims at the destruction of the new institutionality 
pinochet said referring to the 1980 militarywritten constitution 
the text of the speech was carried by the staterun news agency 
orbe 
under the constitution pinochets referendum defeat makes an 
open presidential election mandatory in december 1989 with pinochet 
handing power over to the winner in march 1990 
pinochet has rejected demands for his earlier departure from 
power 
he has ruled since leading a 1973 military coup toppled the 
elected government of marxist president salvador allende who died 
during the overthrow 
after their referendum victory opposition parties listed 
constitutional changes they said were needed for a fast smooth 
transitition to democracy 
the list included eliminating one article that bans marxist 
parties changing another that makes one third of the future 
36member senate appointed instead of elected and reforming the 
composition of a militarydominated national security council the 
opposition sees this council as a permanent threat to future 
civilian government 
the opposition also wants easier rules and lower quorums for 
changing the constitution in the future 
pinochet rejected all the demands one by one 
opening a space to communists in the political system means 
giving them the faculty to use democracy to destroy democracy 
pinochet said 
he warned he will be adamant in rejecting that because the 
freedom of chileans cannot be the subject of negotiations or 
compromise 
he said he cannot accept easing the procedures for future 
constitutional amendments because the fundamental charter which 
is the basis of democracy cannot be left exposed to occasional 
political majorities or temporary electoral pacts 
pinochet said that reducing the military presence in the security 
council would mean again isolating the armed forces from the 
rest of society 
the armed forces have a professional role but within the 
national reality not outside it pinochet said

a judge who heard almost as many versions of 
the us origins of chop suey as there are characters in the chinese 
alphabet sampled a a plate piled high with the stuff and on 
thursday issued his ruling 
san francisco of course 
municipal court judge george t choppelas presiding over a mock 
court of historical review and appeals ruled the vegetable meat 
and noodle dish described as chinese soul food and first made 
with anything that crawled or moved appeared on a gold rushera 
san francisco table about 1850 that was 30 years before it found 
its way to new yorks chinatown menus 
the tongueincheek court has decided other questions such as who 
invented spaghetti where the first martini was mixed and whether 
the panic instilled by orson welles 1938 broadcast about a martian 
invasion could happen today 
choppelas said his finding was supported by both oral history 
handed down through generations of chineseamerican families in 
northern california and a story of its origins with elements of 
lifeordeath necessity and cunning business wiles 
the story came from witness annie soo secretary of the san 
franciscobased chinese historical society of america she testified 
that according to family legend her husbands grandfather was 
working at a san francisco chinese boardinghouse around 1848 when a 
band of drunken hungry miners unable to find any restaurants open 
stormed the rooming house 
when the house owner said he didnt have any food left soo said 
one of the miners aimed a gun at his head and threatened him his 
imagination ignited the owner returned to the kitchen and hastily 
assembled a dish of vegetables and discarded meat entrails heaped 
on a bed of steaming rice the slapdash dish was served to an 
appreciative group 
that whole group enjoyed it very much soo said one of the 
miners asked what the dish was called the boardinghouse owner 
said oh chop suey 
choppelas said the quickthinking owner not only saved his own 
life but gained some loyal customers 
soos story was supported by alon yu of berkeley owner and 
partner in the china station restaurant and imperial palace and 
tommy toys in san francisco 
a fourthgeneration californian yu said his family came to 
northern california from china during the gold rush yu said many 
frugal chinese people working in mining towns survived on leftovers 
from mine owners and were forced to eat whatever crawled or 
moved 
chop suey what yu called chinese soul food is likely to 
have originated from these humble beginnings in california and not 
in new york where large numbers of chinese later immigrated he 
said 
disputing that theory was former new yorker and publicist ivan 
cutler who admitted that he and lawyer jeff brown had difficulty 
deciding if cutler was the suor or the suey in this culinary 
case 
chop suey came to new york in the 1850s cutler said when a 
visiting chinese dignitary dined with president grover cleveland at 
the waldorf astoria because of a sensitive stomach the dignitary 
declined the americanstyle feast and instead had his own chefs whip 
something up for him chop suey 
choppelas quipped that new yorkers like to claim everything good 
but noted they dont call it waldorf suey

troops half of them have been withdrawn under unmediated 
agreements signed in geneva 
the rest are to be pulled out by feb 15 although moscow has 
suspended its withdrawal because of increasing attacks by 
usbacked and pakistanbased rebels 
the report said in general there is greater improvement in 
the human rights situation in governmentcontrolled areas however 
allegations of torture and illtreatment of prisoners on remand 
awaiting trial and political prisoners are still being received 
he said afghan authorities reject the allegations 
ermacora said the number of political prisoners has fallen 
sharply as a result of anmnesty decress and other measures under the 
afghan government policy of national reconciliation conditions of 
detention in policharkhi prison a major center have improved it 
said 
but the investigator also said that after the signing of the 
geneva agreements which afghan rebels rejected acts of terrorism 
have caused many deaths among innocent civilians 
terrorism in afghanistan and pakistan has multipled since 
his report last year he said 
the report cited government reports of rebel violence from april 
to last august it said heavy artillery and groundtoground 
missiles were used against towns and villages charitable 
institutions and mosques the report cited 4154 cases of missile 
firings and 24 explosions killing 945 civilians and wounding 1895

it said a rocket attack on kabul airport killed nine civilians on 
sept 1 and wounded 20 on sept27 a rocket attack on a kabul 
neighborhood reportedly killed 35 civilians 
afghan refugees in pakistan it said still are afraid to return 
home largely because of rebelplanted mines

rights violations and it cited reports of soviet bombing and 
bombardment of civilian areas 
on march 7 it said soviet artillery bombarded residential areas 
in the suburbs of herat at the end of april migrating nomads were 
attacked by soviet and afghan troops and houses schools and mosques 
were damaged and destroyed in other soviet attacks 
many afghan villages and houses have been destroyed in the 
course of the soviet troop withdrawal and many civilians have been 
killed due to the fighting tactics of the oppostion movements and 
acts of retaliation the report said 
the un report said treatment of prisoners of war violates the 
1949 geneva conventions prisoners are used as a means of barganing 
and exchange it said 
the whereabouts of at least 313 soviet soldiers missing in action 
is still unknown it said the afghan government considers rebels to 
be terrorists and not combatants to be treated in accordance with 
international humanitarian law it said

convicted spy jonathan pollard says he deserved 
to be punished for giving us secrets to israel but claims in a 
television interview that his life sentence is unfair 
in an interview to be broadcast on cbs 60 minutes sunday 
pollard said there was no excuse for his passing classified 
information to israeli agents in 1985 when he was a civilian 
intelligence analyst for the navy 
but he said there was an explanation 
pollard said he acted for soft reasons having to do with a 
family that was destroyed in the holocaust having to do with the 
realization that this government in the 40s had abandoned the jewish 
people to its fate in europe 
the hard reason why i did what i did was that us policy 
was fundamentally to place israel in a position where she would be 
forced to make an unenviable choice between a ruinous war or 
shameful peace he said 
the interview took place at the us bureau of prisons maximum 
security penitentiary in marion ill in the presence of two us 
naval intelligence officials 
pollard was sentenced to life imprisonment in march 1987 after 
pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit espionage 
his wife anne hendersonpollard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to 
receive embezzled government property and being an accessory after 
the fact to the possession of national defense secrets she was 
sentenced to five years in prison 
pollard said he considered his sentence unfair because israel is 
an ally and he did not give it information damaging to us 
interests 
my sentence did not reflect proportional justice it reflected 
political vengeance plain and simple pollard said

the ability of women to perform certain tasks 
varies with the level of their sex hormones a study has found 
the research is believed to be the first linking human 
performance to sex hormones 
the study by dr doreen kimura of the university of western 
ontario in london ontario shows women perform significantly better 
in verbal fluency and finemotor muscular control when their 
estrogen and progesterone levels are high 
kimuras study also showed that womens ability to understand 
spatial concepts is enhanced by lower hormone levels 
the researcher said similar patterns probably occur in men whose 
sex hormone testosterone fluctuates daily 
kimura who spoke wednesday at a news briefing during the annual 
meeting of the society for neuroscience tested 200 women during 
their menstrual cycle and postmenopausal women on 
estrogenreplacement therapy 
she compared their spatial cognition and verbal and motor 
abilities during times of peak and low hormone levels 
the levels rise and fall during the course of a womans menstrual 
cycle the peak estrogen phase begins just before ovulation and 
extends until a week to 10 days before menstruation a drop in 
hormone levels occurs during menstruation 
spatial tasks which kimura tested involved identifying a shape in 
a complex pattern tonguetwisters tested verbal skills and 
finemotor tasks included rapid changing of hand postures 
men generally do better on such spatial problems but women on 
average score better on the verbal and finemotor tasks 
in the lowhormone phase it might take a woman three seconds 
longer to repeat a tonguetwister correctly than during her peak 
level the researcher said 
with motortasks women say gosh im really clumsy this 
week said kimura 
she said her study supports the idea that malefemale cognitive 
differences are influenced by sex hormones acting on the brain she 
said she is now studying how mens abilities might vary according to 
the level of testosterone 
its easier to identify these things in women but my guess is 
they can happen also in males said kimura 
she acknowledged that the study suggests there may be optimal 
times for women to perform certain tasks such as taking 
standardized academic examinations 
we really dont know enough yet she said it may be in a 
couple of years well know enough about it to say there are 
significant enough effects that these can be factors in test scores 
and performance 
kimura stressed that abilities vary greatly among individual men 
and women with some women better at tasks in which men generally 
excel 
theres an enormous overlap in the ability patterns between men 
and women she said 
you dont have to look at a persons genitals to decide whether 
theyre going to be a good air traffic controller you can give them 
a test of spatial ability

the justice department is investigating whether 
us attorney frank l mcnamara jr made false statements about his 
predecessor when he accused him of smoking marijuana sources said 
thursday 
the allegations were rejected by a federal inquiry 
mcnamara had told investigators he saw his predecessor william 
f weld smoking marijuana at a 1982 party in virginia but the 
report of a 1987 justice department probe released wednesday found 
no evidence whatsoever to support the claim 
weld later headed the justice departments criminal division 
mcnamara issued a twosentence statement responding to the 
report which was filed in federal appeals court in washington by 
attorney general richard thornburgh 
upon receiving the report released by the court i immediately 
requested that the department of justice conduct a prompt and 
thorough investigation to resolve any suggestion of impropriety by 
me raised in the report mcnamara said 
i will continue to cooperate with the department of justice in 
every way in order to resolve this matter as quickly as possible 
he said 
mcnamaras secretary said he was out of his office and 
unavailable for comment 
justice department spokesman john russell declined to comment on 
whether mcnamara was under investigation 
but federal law enforcement sources in washington speaking on 
condition of anonymity said the justice departments office of 
professional responsibility was investigating whether mcnamara made 
false statements about weld 
assistant us attorney john markham who was appointed by weld 
in boston in april 1985 said mcnamaras allegation about weld was 
just not possible 
everybody who has worked with him knows him to be completely 
apolitical as a prosecutor and a straightarrow markham said in 
an interview thursday 
president reagan nominated mcnamara to succeed weld in april 
1987 a few months after weld was appointed to head the justice 
departments criminal division in washington 
an internal justice department memo on which thornburghs court 
filing was based said that after he went to washington conflict 
developed between weld and the office of thendeputy attorney 
general arnold burns 
james byrnes a deputy assistant attorney general who was helping 
to shepherd mcnamaras nomination as us attorney in boston through 
the senate told investigators that burns requested him to call 
mcnamara to dig up some dirt on weld 
mcnamara who told investigators weld opposed his nomination and 
believed weld was trying to scuttle it then told byrnes that he had 
seen weld drunk on a couple of occasions and had seen him smoking a 
joint at a party after a wedding in virginia in 1982 
the memo said it is unclear whether byrnes who said he had no 
specific recollection of briefing burns reported back what mcnamara 
had said 
burns and weld resigned from the justice department on march 29 
to protest former attorney general edwin meese iiis continued 
tenure 
asked whether he believed burns had requested officials to dig 
up dirt weld said thursday ive spoken to arnie and theres no 
misunderstanding between us as to the events at the justice 
department 
weld said his relations with burns are good he declined further 
comment 
burns on wednesday labeled as categorically untrue the 
allegation that he told byrnes to call mcnamara about weld 
the justice department memo also said mcnamara told the fbi that 
he had smoked marijuana as recently as four years ago

estonias parliament struck an 
unprecedented blow for independence for the baltic republics by 
declaring sovereignty and the right to veto soviet laws lithuanians 
prepared to debate similar action 
the kremlin had no immediate reaction to wednesdays move by 
estonias supreme soviet 
estonias supreme soviet passed the declaration of sovereignty by 
a 2581 vote with five abstentions after a day of restrained debate 
legislators argued that too much soviet control has ruined the 
economy and environment and that estonia must control its own land 
factories and laws 
the declaration stopped short of complete independence but it 
called for a treaty with moscow that would determine the further 
status of estonia in the composition of the soviet union about 
twothirds of the republics 16 million people are ethnic estonians

social security benefits to people born before

congress should neither reduce benefits to those getting the

released wednesday by the nonpartisan national academy of social 
insurance 
i would strongly hope that this issue can be put to rest as a 
result of the report said suzanne dilk a former senior analyst 
with the social security administration and one of four experts on 
the study panel 
in a related development lawmakers and lobbyists reacted angrily 
to a draft government proposal that would make it harder for the

the author of one of the first novels to 
give americans a look into miamis cuban community laughs about the 
critical success of his work 
i think whats caught the attention probably is its the 
first book about cubanamericans the first novel in english that 
takes place in miami roberto g fernandez said in a recent 
interview in his office at florida state university where he 
teaches latin american literature 
fernandez 37 has three books to his credit the first in a 
mixture of spanish and english called spanglish the second in 
spanish and the third raining backwards in english 
one day i was writing and everything was coming out more or 
less in english he said and i said lets give it a try and 
see what happens 
what happened was a novel that reviewers have compared to the 
works of james joyce william burroughs and jorge borges 
sometimes you want to believe it and sometimes you say well 
is it true or what the author said 
he described raining backwards as a work that looks at how 
immigrants cope with their new reality and theres a lot of 
fantasy not fantasy mythcreation 
the title comes from a prediction made by one of the novels 
characters an elderly woman who wants to travel from south florida 
to cuba in a canoe so she can be buried in her homeland once she 
lands she plans to wave a white flag and grab a cab to the 
cemetery then she thinks it will begin to rain backwards 
you create myths to justify yourself in this new environment 
and the myths suddenly become i mean you start with a myth and 
then you dont know where reality is and where the myth is so life 
has become sort of chaotic and in a way i guess out of that chaos 
you make more myths to make sense fernandez said 
he thinks the themes of raining backwards are universal 
i think everybody fantasizes when you move from one place to 
another it doesnt have to be cuba it could be china it could be 
here from to i dont know to nebraska or something 
fernandez who came to florida when he was about 10 with his 
parents and older brother spends his summer vacations and holidays 
in south florida where many of his relatives live the bulk of 
raining backwards was written in miami last summer but the 
ideas came to him in tallahassee 
the book has a certain vitality to it the author said 
i think the book is alive has spark in it he said lately 
us literature has been a little dry i mean its perfect 
technically but theres something no spark there 
writing raining backwards was fun according to fernandez 
who writes in longhand on legal pads and later transfers his work 
to a word processor 
i was laughing he said as a matter of fact i was living 
in that world i wouldnt go out theyd say you like to go out 
no i want to go home and write 
fernandez who thinks he expresses himself better in writing can 
remember writing in school when he first came to the united states 
and he couldnt understand what the teacher was saying those early 
days were sad and bewildering ones for his family 
at the beginning we thought that it was going to be like we 
were going to be here for a couple of months and then it would be 
for a couple of years and then its been now like 26 years or 
something like that he said 
so at the beginning i mean we just i mean you didnt know 
what to expect it was sort of like more or less scared you know 
trying to keep a low profile kind of thing he recalled 
his books however are not autobiographical fernandez said 
they are a composite of different people that i have seen in 
different experiences and those characters are out there you know 
if you pay a little attention he said if you pay a little 
attention you hear a lot of outrageous things 
and fernandez doesnt consider himself an exile writer 
maybe you can say im an american writer of cuban extraction 
writing about the things he knows

a cultural gap almost kept maruschka detmers from 
playing a part for which she thought she was destined 
the dutchborn actress had read the script for hannas war a 
film based on the true story of a young hungarian who stood up to 
the nazis and considered herself perfect for the lead 
i recognized something that was meant for me detmers said 
i knew that i was going to do that i came there totally calm i 
didnt feel i had to convince anybody 
except the director menaham golan over the top the delta 
force who insisted that detmers test for the part 
i could see his point the actress said nobody knows me in 
the united states this project is something he wanted to do for a 
long long time in europe its not very usual for people to have a 
screen test unless youre just beginning here its very normal to 
ask for one 
but detmers didnt feel that way at the time she told golan 
there was no reason to audition and walked off the set 
it was not a tactic at all i went back to the hotel not even 
thinking about the consequences of what i had done i was already 
arranging for my ticket back to paris the actress said with a 
laugh 
and then in true hollywood fashion detmers got another chance 
golan called her and asked if he could stop by the director arrived 
with a script under his arm 
he said let me read for you detmers recalled hes a 
big man if you saw menaham you could imagine how touching it was 
from him to read a poem of hannahs when she was 16 years old he 
started reading and i said ok ill read the poem 
i read two lines and he said ok ok you dont have to go on 
its you its you 
it wasnt the first time that the 24yearold detmers had taken a 
chance at 18 she went to paris to pursue a career in theater two 
problems she couldnt speak french and had no acting experience 
it wasnt much of a risk she shrugged they chose me as 
the first one of 750 people in some kind of selection thing an 
agent signed me up when i didnt even know what an agent was i knew 
that it was logical i was never surprised 
detmers wasnt so nonchalant about her debut film prenom 
carmen directed by jean luc godard breathless band of 
outsiders who helped lead the french new wave explosion in 
the late 1950s 
i can either talk about him for three days without interruption 
or just say it was extremely confusing and difficult he was not 
nice at all after two weeks he was telling everybody how bad they 
were 
but she felt she understood what made godard so difficult to work 
with 
he is extremely sensitive to absolute things in life absolute 
whenever they happen nobody talks nobody writes nobody speaks 
nobody films as soon as you film something or write something you 
start the betrayal of the idea that something is absolute 
while detmers enjoyed an easier relationship with golan on the 
set of hannas war she still found the film an overwhelming 
experience 
i was just walking with this bubble around me sometimes people 
didnt dare approach me i just couldnt keep my mind on anything 
else wherever hanna went she had this incredible impact on people 
she was converted into some kind of spiritual center 
im sorry if i use pompous words but its the only way i can 
talk about her 
hanna senesh was born in budapest in 1921 and grew up in a 
welltodo family she showed an early talent for writing and hoped 
to study at the university of budapest 
but with the rise of hitler she fled to palestine when she was 
17 and became passionate about furthering the cause of a jewish 
homeland senesh returned to budapest in 1944 and joined the fight 
to defend jews against the nazis who now occupied the country 
i understood what was pushing her detmers said the force 
behind everything she did was neither a religious ideal nor a 
political conviction nor some kind of an opinion about something it 
was a life force itself 
people use the word courage when they talk about her i dont 
think courage ever came into her mind she was just doing what she 
had to do 
senesh was eventually convicted for treason by a military court 
in budapest and executed in her closing statement to the court she 
delivered a powerful denunciation of the nazis and their 
collaborators 
detmers took great pride in the filming of the courtroom scene 
it was so well constructed that speech she said it was 
exactly what she was about in filming i hardly ever feel anything 
joyous everything in the film seems to be made to keep the actors 
from doing what they have to accomplish but that speech was really 
nice to do

thailand has begun looking to its 
communistgoverned neighbors as trading partners after shunning them 
since the indochina war years 
calling for increased commerce with vietnam laos and cambodia 
thai businessmen voice fear they are being outdone by counterparts 
from japan and singapore which are drawing 200 million to 300 
million a year in a low profile but brisk trade 
as vietnam liberalizes its underdeveloped economy thai 
businessmen and some legislators worry that if they act too slowly 
japan and singapore along with hong kong taiwan or france will 
corner a market that thailand is in a favorable geographic position 
to penetrate 
prime minister chatichai choonhavan himself a businessman 
started talking about improving general relations with indochina as 
well as exploring economic opportunities shortly after taking office 
in august 
already thai businessmen are angling for fishing licenses in 
bountiful vietnamese waters and sending agricultural experts to laos 
to supervise an experimental farm while importing laotian timber 
laotians shop at a thairun department store in vientiane the 
laotian capital and a thai company recently entered into the first 
major joint venture project in laos the construction of a garment 
factory 
but officially thailand has thus far had no 
governmenttogovernment economic transactions with vietnam since 
its troops invaded neighboring cambodia and thai policy has been 
one of putting pressure on the vietnamese in all fields the thai 
government also offers no help to private entrepreneurs doing 
business with indochina but it generally turns a blind eye to the 
vast black market trade across its borders with cambodia and laos as 
well as burma 
we have lost time and lost out to countries that actively 
traded with indochina regardless of their governments strong 
opposition to vietnamese troops in cambodia said wongse 
polnikorn a former deputy foreign minister and currently chairman 
of a thai company that will import timber from laos and set up a 
cashcrop farm in vientiane 
prime minister chatichai has instructed that the number of goods 
officially banned for export to laos be halved to 30 according to 
government spokesman suvit yodmani 
since the 1975 communist victories in indochina periodic 
skirmishes as well as two major confrontations have erupted 
along the thailaotian border similar clashes have occurred between 
thais and vietnamese along the thaicambodian frontier 
last year twoway trade between laos and thailand topped 48 
million although the black market or unofficial trade is 
known to be far higher twoway trade with vietnam rose to 75 
million last year from 48 million in 1986 while thai exports to 
cambodia were 400000 in 1986 
but some in thailand which has traditionally been suspicious of 
vietnams longterm intentions in the region view a prosperous 
vietnam as potentially dangerous and expansionist 
if we can make vietnam prosperous ourselves prosperous thats 
great but what is there to guarantee that vietnam wont move into 
thailands northeast spokesman suvit said in an interview once 
its prosperous then it can afford to keep troops in cambodia 
surin pitsuwan a leading member of parliament suggested that 
thailand at first proceed cautiously in trading with laos a country 
with which it shares ethnic and cultural bonds and which poses no 
major security threat he also suggested more economic dealings with 
burma with which official twoway trade totaled 544 million in 
1987 
there are a lot of trade opportunities and untapped resources 
next door surin said if we dont hurry now the degree of 
their dependence on us will be reduced 
although thailand will be hard pressed to compete with japanese 
technology and funding businessmen say the thais could carve out a 
profitable indochina niche in such areas as agroindustry fishing 
forestry and smallerscale construction 
thailand where the economy is booming and consumer spending on 
an upward curve could also serve as a market for indochinese goods 
while war has largely wrecked economic infrastructure in indochina 
the three countries possess large untapped natural resources and an 
abundance of cheap labor 
we must go and explore ways we can do more and benefit from one 
another said kangwan tantiponganant a businessmen involved in 
laos given the political sensitivities other thai businessmen 
prefer to make lowkeyed trips to vietnam and laos emphasizing that 
their interests are in longterm business planning

in his pursuit of a bargain for taxpayers 
edward aleixo has flown into the mountains of virginia to retrieve 
an old pickup truck with bad tires and no rear lights driving it 
home to massachusetts 
he has wangled his way into government vaults and come out with 
an oriental rug henry kissinger couldnt use and procured shelving 
and two office cubicles discarded by the white house 
aleixo a retired air force colonel former narcotics agent and 
onetime school superintendent makes big deals too 
as director of the massachusetts state agency for surplus 
property aleixo is trying at the moment to get his hands on 12 used 
helicopters no longer wanted by the army in fort rucker ala so he 
can give them to state police and a flight school in boston 
note the word give 
alexio insists he doesnt sell a thing he brokers but for a 
relatively small price that covers the cost of his operation aleixo 
obtains surplus federal property and passes it on to state and 
municipal governments schools and nonprofit organizations such as 
nursing homes and halfway houses 
a relatively small price 
how does 150 sound for a 184056 medical centrifuge like new 
or 2500 for a used 200000 road grader 
the 9by12foot kissinger rug was a gift from algeria that the 
thensecretary of state couldnt accept it now warms the toes of 
some massachusetts government official a bargain at 150 
every state has a surplus agency under a law congress enacted 
after world war ii to make sure the states shared in the federal 
leftovers customers are restricted to government entities 
educational institutions and nonprofit health agencies there are 
1800 certified customers around the country 
in massachusetts theres a twiceyearly junkyard sale but 
otherwise aleixos warehouses are closed to the public his 
customers say access to the surplus stuff helps 
its tremendous said brian broderick who for 15 years has 
been buying surplus goods for the metropolitan district commission 
an agency that oversees highways sewers and other projects that 
cross juridictions in the boston area 
government surplus kept the commission rolling a decade ago while 
waiting for a bond issue to buy new vehicles for instance 
tractortrailers were supplied for a song 5000 apiece for a set 
of four that would have cost 65000 each new 
the metro police command bus a headquarters on wheels was once 
a nasa mobile tracking station we paid no more than 1000 for 
it a nice piece of equipment that would have cost us 55000 to 
60000 
this is the cheapest way the government has of getting rid of 
its property aleixo said most of the money goes back to the 
taxpayer 
customers pay about 3 cents on the original dollar cost to the 
government even so aleixos selfsupporting operation is in the 
red trying to cover its 450000 annual operating costs including a 
staff of 12 since the late 1970s federal agencies have become more 
economy minded 
that is good but theres a point where its more 
costeffective to buy something new rather than fix the old 
aleixo said 
he reckons the state government saves 1 million a year picking 
through his warehouse the assorted other customers save 5 million 
to 6 million 
rotund and low to the ground aleixo is an intense man with a 
sense of purpose and a oneliner to describe his work we get all 
the bang thats left in the buck 
even the warehouses storing the goods are handmedowns a pair 
of long gray metalclad buildings at the back of an industrial park 
they were erected in 1942 as an assembly point for soldiers shipping 
off to fight world war ii 
inside every truck electron microscope and box of bolts gets a 
number 
items that cost the government more than 5000 when new must be 
used by the receiver within a year if not the new owner doesnt 
get title to the object and it is considered stolen property items 
costing more than 10000 must be used within 36 months 
whats in the inventory 
dental file cabinets an oboe and half a piccolo tons of bolts 
for building bridges metal and wood desks in various stages of 
decrepitude from the internal revenue service a brass bedstead once 
belonging to a naval computer testing equipment computer circuit 
boards air conditioner filters 
also leftover pipe from a submarine ice skates map file 
drawers machine tool drills typewriters and calculators chairs 
an aircraft camera tool boxes an offset press and armygreen gas 
tanks among the takings when a government supplier came under 
criminal scrutiny and the relationship ended 
so what can agencies or schools do with say a jet engine 
container or 2000 feet of 2inch plastic tubing 
i advise them to send a creative person a person with a spirit 
of innovation who can see a new way to use something aleixo said 
the kids from mit theyre probably our biggest customers

when a character on nbcs empty nest was 
asked what to wear to an opera and replied how should i know im 
from arkansas at least one viewer wasnt laughing 
arkansas native linda bloodworththomason creator of cbs 
designing women says shes tired of television making fun of 
southerners 
designing women is about four smart southern women emphasis 
on smart who run a design store next season bloodworththomason 
gets another show to make her point tentatively titled 
arkansas the cbs show will tentatively star hal holbrook 
husband of designing women star dixie carter 
i sort of want to do that town thats in its a wonderful 
life you know where everybody knows everybody and everybodys 
still real good she said theres going to be people who talk 
like hicks and rednecks talking about glasnost and perestroika and 
they know whats going on in the world i think well make some 
points for our side with it 
i dont want to be humorless about it but i feel that negative 
stereotype is very damaging to children she said i think they 
are definitely affected i think they grow up thinking they have to 
move to new york to validate themselves i think susan harris 
creator of golden girls and empty nest is a beautiful 
writer but i found some of the jokes in the empty nest pilot 
objectionable 
she said she especially objected when laverne park overall a 
receptionist was asked what arkansans do on saturday night she 
replied you wash your hair until youre 14 then you marry your 
cousin 
bloodworththomason and her producerdirector husband harry 
thomason call their production company mozark since hes from 
neighboring missouri 
an nbc publicist for empty nest said that shows producers 
did not care to comment on bloodworththomasons remarks it is 
worth noting that on harris golden girls betty whites 
character pokes fun of minnesotans as boring and unsophisticated 
when other regions of the country are depicted their 
eccentricities are always sort of delightful said 
bloodworththomason like if theyre new englanders theyre 
stubborn and thrifty i mean excuse me for being overly sensitive 
but i would rather be called stubborn and thrifty than ignorant 
and incestuous 
it seems like a small thing and it seems like youre 
nitpicking but the truth is its gone on so long and it permeates 
the media to such an extent i think its a stereotype that hasnt 
begun to die

every day is thanksgiving day at the 
rainbow kitchen one of hundreds of american soup kitchens where 
hunger never takes a holiday 
these people need help yearround not just during the 
holidays kevin amos said as he stocked the rainbow kitchens 
pantry with canned goods 
this is one of those thousand points of light presidentelect 
george bush talks about said bob anderson a former steel 
worker but theres no reason this kind of charity should have to 
exist we just keep going because we dont want to see people turned 
away 
anderson opened the rainbow kitchen in 1984 after the sharp 
decline of steel and heavy manufacturing left thousands jobless in 
homestead a historic steel town adjacent to pittsburgh 
the rainbow kitchen is one cog amid all the soup lines food 
banks churches and senior citizen centers nationwide that make up 
an evergrowing mostly volunteer and imperfect machine that 
distributes millions of pounds of free food every year 
we never thought wed be in operation this long anderson 
said the number of people we serve just keeps growing and 
growing 
homesteads eighth avenue bustled when us steels sprawling 
homestead works was turning out giant steel slabs into the early 
1980s but the mill is cold and shuttered now and business on the 
avenue is slower 
at noon each day a quiet line forms outside the rainbow kitchen 
where hot lunches are served to an average of 185 people 
we get a mixture of people anderson said it used to be a 
lot more unemployed people i think now its more underemployed 
people i see more children than id like to see here we get whole 
families 
one recent chilly afternoon sharon fischer 25 expressed 
gratitude as she and two of her three young children munched on 
hamburger patties pasta and potato salad served on plastic plates 
im not ashamed im not rich she said this is decent 
they make sure youre full when you leave 
ms fischer single and unemployed said she has looked for work 
but they arent hiring she said she cant get by on food 
stamps so she eats at the kitchen several times a week 
anderson operates the rainbow kitchen on 125000 a year most of 
the money comes from small donations although rock star bruce 
springstein donated 10000 in 1985 
sometimes we run out of food and just hold up the line 
anderson said we open up some big cans of beans or something and 
just start making sandwiches like crazy 
every thursday the rainbow kitchen opens its pantry to about 700 
families who are given a bag or two of groceries 
since 1980 changes by congress and the reagan administration 
have narrowed eligibility for food stamps and therefore reduced the 
amount going out last year the federal government spent 1059 
billion for food stamps compared with 1198 billion in 1980 
according to census bureau figures adjusted for inflation in that 
time the number of people receiving food stamps declined by about 
900000 the census bureau said 
in roughly the same period from 1979 to the present the number 
of people living below the poverty line of 11600 annual income for 
a family of four has grown by 6 million the government reports 
many people eligible for food stamps either dont apply or are 
wrongly rejected according to robert fersh executive director of 
the nonprofit food research and action center in washington dc 
on average food stamp recipients each month get stamps worth 
about 54 cents per meal although fersh said some elderly 
individuals get as little as 10 a month its therefore no surprise 
many run out of money at months end and turn to pantries and soup 
kitchens for help he said 
the number of people needing food by the end of the month has 
risen fersh said the people who rely on the safety net not 
only have had food assistance cut but have to pay more for medical 
care and utilities 
annual surveys by the us conference of mayors reveal a steady 
increase in the need for emergency food said laura waxman 
assistant executive director of the group 
a survey of 26 cities found twothirds of those who needed food 
in 1987 were families with children she said 
you think of the traditional soup kitchen user as the single 
man or the single woman but we know there are more and more 
families ms waxman said 
the heart of the nations grassroots food distribution is the 
second harvest national food bank network which began in 1979 in 
phoenix 
last year second harvest now based in chicago distributed 
about 387 million pounds of food its 205 affiliated food banks 
served 38000 local charities including pantries soup kitchens 
shelters and daycare and senior citizen centers 
yet the need for more food is constant 
what i generally hear are stories of a food pantry that is so 
strapped for food and money that it is only able to supply three 
days supply of food per family per month regardless of the depth of 
the familys need said john arnold public policy manager for 
second harvest 
many of the nations food banks started in church basements with 
one vehicle to haul food but the average food bank today has 
several trucks and handles 3 million to 6 million pounds of food a 
year arnold said 
the greater pittsburgh community food bank boasts a 
160000squarefoot warehouse in nearby mckeesport that was bought 
after a fundraising drive led by two local banks in 1987 the food 
bank distributed about 73 million pounds of food to about 300 
affiliates including the rainbow kitchen said executive director 
joyce rothermal 
more than half the food banks supplies are donated by second 
harvest grocery stores and individuals some are bought with state 
money a small portion with federal money and the remainder with 
food bank money 
theres a group of people who are really bad off ms 
rothermal said its falling to the private sector to help them 
harry and marian halt of homestead who have a teenage son and 
daughter were among those crowded into the rainbow kitchen on a 
recent thursday waiting with paper bags and carts to pick up a slab 
of butter a carton of eggs and other groceries 
we usually make the food stretch but we sometimes get a little 
close said halt 47 he said heart problems forced him in 1986 to 
quit his job as a caseworker for the state department of welfare 
i dont know what wed do without these food banks halt said

facing the prospect of fresh declines in 
world oil prices opec chiefs gathering today in vienna are under 
pressure to fashion a new agreement that will control the cartels 
surging production and help bolster crude prices 
ministers from eight of the 13 nations that make up the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries were meeting for talks 
on bringing order to the chaotic oil market 
there is a feeling they have to come up with a new production 
agreement said one opec official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity 
they will work very hard at it because of the consequence of 
failurea collapse in prices he said 
the eight ministers are meeting in a joint session of two opec 
committees in talks that could run into the weekend on monday all 
13 ministers are to meet for the cartels winter meeting 
at issue is the thorny problem of how to address the cartels 
recently skyrocketing output which has added to an already glutted 
world market analysts say most opec members have exceeded their 
production quotas partly to press for position in advance of the 
vienna meetings 
as a result prices have slipped 4 or more below opecs 
benchmark price of 18 a barrel a barrel is equivalent to 42 
gallons 
on the new york mercantile exchange the december contract for 
west texas intermediate the benchmark grade of us crude oil fell 
23 cents wednesday to settle at 1367 a barrel after falling 37 
cents on tuesday 
the recent declines reflect how dramatically opec production has 
risen 
the international energy agency estimated in its monthly oil 
market report that opec production was nearly 211 million barrels a 
day in october the highest monthly output in more than five years 
opecs official total production quota under a december 1986 
arrangement is about 15 million barrels a day that excludes iraq 
which has ignored its limit 
nick antill oil analyst at the london brokerage county natwest 
estimated next years demand for opec oil at 187 million barrels a 
day 
joseph stanislaw managing director of cambridge energy research 
associates in paris speculated that a new accord might set total 
output at 19 million to 195 million barrels a day 
a key to a new quota agreement is bringing iraq back into the 
system 
saudi arabia the worlds largest oil exporter and opecs most 
influential member and kuwait have insisted that a fresh accord 
must include all members 
saudi arabia recently increased its production to more than 6 
million barrels a day well above its ceiling of 43 million 
barrels in an attempt to pressure other cartel members to obey 
their quotas 
iraq has refused to obey its daily ceiling of 15 million barrels 
because it wanted parity with war rival iran which has a quota of 
24 million barrels 
the two countries agreed to an august ceasefire in their 
8yearold war and both want to earn more oil revenue to pay for 
rebuilding their warravaged economies 
analysts estimated iraq has been producing at least 26 million 
barrels a day and could boost production to 37 million barrels 
next year with completion of a new pipeline through saudi arabia to 
the red sea 
under a new system iran and iraq might each get a quota of 26 
million barrels analysts predicted 
opec ministers also must deal with the united arab emirates 
refusal to stick to its quota of 948000 million barrels a day it 
independently has boosted its limit to 15 million barrels 
opecs price evolution committee meeting thursday with the 
longterm strategy panel is made up of algeria saudi arabia 
nigeria indonesia and venezuela the strategy committees members 
are iraq iran kuwait saudi arabia algeria and venezuela 
other opec members are ecuador gabon libya qatar and the

grand metropolitan plc says it is going to 
court to try and block pillsbury cos plan to spin off its burger 
king fastfood chain the key element in pillsburys attempt to 
thwart grand mets hostile 523 billion takeover bid 
the spinoff set for dec 2 is part of a defensive restructuring 
the food and restaurant company announced after rejecting grand 
mets 60 a share tender offer as inadequate on oct 17 
pillsbury contends its shareholders would be better off with the 
restructuring in which they would receive a special dividend and 
stock in the newly separate burger king which accounts for a huge 
chunk of pillsburys revenues but is slumping 
but grand met claims it would have to lower its buyout offer 
should the spinoff occur because the restructured company would 
present a huge tax liability for grand met 
grand met said wednesday it planned to ask for a temporary 
restraining order in delaware chancery court where chancellor 
william allen has said he would hold a hearing nov 28 
according to grand met allen also said he would set a hearing 
for dec 12 on grand mets renewed motion to invalidate pillsburys 
poison pill takeover defense the tender offer which has been 
extended three times is conditioned on the removal of the pill 
which would make a takeover prohibitively expensive 
dissident shareholders also have sued to have the pill 
invalidated but courts in delaware and minnesota have left it 
intact 
pillsbury stock closed at 56 wednesday down 2 a share in 
composite new york stock exchange trading 
in another matter documents from both companies filed with the 
securities and exchange commission indicate pillsbury chairman 
philip smith on tuesday rejected a telephone request from grand met 
chairman allen sheppard to meet in new york to discuss the tender 
offer 
sheppard on wednesday renewed his criticism of pillsburys stance 
we are amazed at the negative response to our overture given 
that almost 80 percent of the pillsbury shares had been tendered to 
grand met as of nov 14 sheppard said in a statement 
pillsbury had no comment in its sec filing pillsbury said smith 
told sheppard in their phone discussion that he saw no purpose in 
meeting 
mr smith notedthat if mr sheppard had anything additional 
for the board to consider he would report it to the board 
pillsburys sec document said 
in grand mets account of the telephone conversation smith said 
he was led to believe from media reports and company statements that 
grand met was firm on the price of its tender offer 
mr sheppard indicated that while he presently saw no reason to 
increase the offer price he had heard that mr smith was a very 
good salesman and was prepared to listen to any argument that mr 
smith might have regarding why grand met ought to pay more than 60 
a share grand met stated

japans refusal to import us rice is the work of 
an evil empire that manipulates the japanese agricultural 
business according to the head of the us rice millers 
association 
stephen gabbert president of the association that groups rice 
producers in six us states said thursday that japan could start 
easing some of its social problems such as high land housing and 
food prices by liberalizing its heavilycontrolled rice market 
the us government in late october rejected a petition by the 
rice millers association to proceed with a complaint against 
japans ban on rice imports but also said japans policy 
contravened trade agreements and the millers complaint could be 
reintroduced if there is no progress in easing the ban 
after laborious negotiations earlier this year japan agreed to 
accept more us beef and oranges but it firmly has rejected calls 
to open its rice market 
rice is japans staple food and the governments policy of 
selfsufficiency in rice it requires massive subsidies to farmers 
retail rice prices are at least triple us prices 
gabbert told a news conference with foreign journalists that 
japans rice policy is a fantastic example of economic distortion 
and it basically stinks 
he said bureaucrats in the agriculture ministry have no 
understanding of economic reality and sharply criticized the 
nations network of agricultural cooperatives which are powerful 
political lobbyists with huge economic resources 
japans rice policy gabbert said is tied to a cooperative 
framework which i would characterize as basically an evil empire 
the cooperative movement is supposed to help japanese farmers and 
consumers he said but it exploits farmers and gouges consumers 
gabbert proposed a 25 percent a year opening of japans rice 
market over a fouryear period ten percent of the rice market would 
be as much as american growers could produce he said noting that 
25 percent of us rice fields now are out of production 
if japan liberalizes its market he predicted japanese farmers 
would become more efficient that land and housing prices would go 
down because some paddy land would be freed for housing and that 
japanese consumers could spend less on agricultural products and 
more on manufactured imports thus further helping the country 
reduce its huge trade surplus 
gabbert was in japan which he said he had visited 20 times in 
the past 15 years to study his associations options as it decides 
what to do next in its drive to penetrate japans rice market

the dollar fell in european trading today reaching 
its lowest level against major foreign currencies in more than five 
months gold prices also fell 
the slight improvement in the us trade deficit in september 
announced on wednesday was not enough to reverse the downward 
pressure on the dollar foreign currency dealers said 
the us trade deficit narrowed to 1046 billion from 1218 
billion in august 
in tokyo where trading ends before europes business day begins 
the dollar fell to a 15year low against the japanese yen closing 
at 12152 yen despite reported central bank intervention 
later in london it was quoted at 12200 yen 
the bank of japan reportedly intervened in the market on a 
pretty big scale to prevent the dollars further decline said 
one dealer in tokyo 
the bank refused to comment on its activities but japanese 
finance minister kiichi miyazawa called for joint action by monetary 
authorities to prop up the sagging dollar a finance ministry 
official said on condition of anonymity 
other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late wednesdays 
prices included 17190 west german marks down from 17230 14425 
swiss francs down from 14465 58745 french francs down from 
58975 19399 dutch guilders down from 19575 128010 italian 
lire down from 129100 and 12323 canadian dollars up from 
12305 
in london one british pound cost 18325 1 cent more expensive 
for buyers than late wednesdays 18225 and the pounds highest 
level against the dollar since may 31 
londons five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price for 
gold of 42330 a troy ounce at midmorning today unchanged from the 
opening bid but down from 42550 bid late wednesday 
in zurich the bid price was also 42330 down from 42540 bid 
late wednesday 
bullion dealers in london said gold is languishing in narrow 
ranges despite the dollars weakness because the precious metal 
didnt have enough momentum to break through a strong resistance 
level at 426 on wednesday 
people just became frustrated and took some profits on long 
positions wednesday and theres not enough business in the european 
market today to warrant a good move in either direction one 
dealer said 
earlier in hong kong gold rose 65 cents to close at a bid 
42434 
silver was quoted in london at a bid price of 632 a troy ounce 
down from wednesdays 639

the dollar plummeted to a 15year low against the 
japanese yen today despite the bank of japans reported 
intervention but share prices rose on the tokyo stock exchange 
the dollar closed at 12152 yen down 202 yen from wednesdays 
close of 12354 yen opening at 12240 yen the currency ranged 
between 12130 and 12240 yen 
todays close was the lowest since the tokyo market began 
floating the exchange rate when the brettonwoods system was 
abandoned in february 1973 before then one dollar was fixed at 360 
yen 
the brettonwoods agreement at the end of world war ii 
established the international currency exchange system in which the 
dollars value was fixed at that of one ounce of gold and all other 
currency rates were pegged to the dollar 
dealers attributed the dollars dive today largely to investors 
pessimism over washingtons ability to reduce its trade deficit and 
the central banks failure to prop up the currency 
market sources said the central bank bought dollars 
intermittently throughout the day but failed to reverse the 
currencys decline because it bought only a small amount of dollar 
compared to the amount of money in the market said mitsuhiko 
kinugasa of daiwa bank 
the bank of japan does not comment on its activities 
on wednesday the us commerce department said the nations 
september trade deficit was 105 billion down from 1227 billion 
in august 
but the dollar will keep falling as long as the market 
sentiment for the weaker dollar continues said sumio fukushima of 
sumitomo bank 
despite the improved us trade deficit it is still large and 
the united states has not shown any signs to attempting to reduce 
its deficit further fukushima said 
a dealer with the bank of tokyo said neither central bank 
intervention nor dollarbuying by speculators could stop the 
currencys decline 
there are still so many people who want to get rid of the 
currency he said adding he doubted if the dollar ever could 
return to the 122yen level he also spoke anonymously 
meanwhile the 225issue nikkei stock average which closed 
wednesday at 2899612 added 8069 points or 028 percent to 
close above the 29000 level for the first time its finish at 
2907681 was its fifth straight record high 
share prices opened lower in tokyo following declines in overseas 
markets and the dollars plunge in new york but gradually rose 
toward the end of trading as dealers became interested in a wide 
varieties of issues said nikko securities yoshio shimoyama 
but many investors especially speculative ones were sitting 
on the sidelines to see what happens to the currency market he 
said 
in moderate trading with 850 shares traded on the first section 
electrical issues attracted participants

alan greenspan chairman of the federal reserve 
it is beguiling to contemplate the strong economy of recent years 
in the context of very large deficits and to conclude that the 
concerns about the adverse effects of the deficit have been 
misplaced 
but this argument is fanciful 
the deficit already has begun to eat away at the foundations of 
our economic strength and the need to deal with it is becoming ever 
more urgent to the extent that some of the negative effects of 
deficits have not as yet been felt they have been merely postponed 
not avoided moreover the scope for further such avoidance is 
shrinking

day in and day out the american public is subjected to another 
newspaper column or television news story stating as if it were 
fact that the federal budget deficit is so large and spending has 
been cut so much that no matter what the presidentelect might say 
taxes will have to go up or the economy will founder 
vice president bush never succumbed to this herd psychology and 
neither did voters throughout the presidential campaign the vice 
president spoke of a fair and flexible freeze to balance the budget 
without raising taxes 
many opinion leaders ridiculed this idea as void of substance and 
impractical in fact a fair and flexible freeze is imminently 
doable and goes right to the heart of the federal budget deficit 
problem the deficit persists not because revenues are growing too 
slowly but because federal spending has been increasing much too 
rapidly

charls e walker chairman american council for capital 
formation former deputy treasury secretary 
while spending restraint should be accorded first priority in 
deficit reduction it is an inescapable fact that a swing of 180 
billion per year in the federal budget is all but impossible without 
a significant tax increase 
the only alternatives are either decimation of the defense 
budget or sharp and politically undoable cuts in social security 
and medicare 
from a political standpoint a workable approach might be a 
fiveyear budget plan that would split the deficit reduction task 
evenly between spending restraint and tax increases or 90 billion 
per year for each 
spending goals would be met by slowing the rate of increase in 
federal spending relative to potential gnp gross national product 
on the tax side it is clear that new sources of revenue will have 
to be sought 
a broadbased consumption tax such as a value added tax vat 
has several advantages over other types of tax increases it is a 
powerful revenue raiser providing more than 10 billion per point 
per year if broadly applied surveys show that it is the least 
unpopular tax the tax people prefer to pay if they must pay more

alice m rivlin senior fellow at brookings institution former 
head of the congressional budget office 
solution to the deficit problem must be bipartisan not only 
because the voters have elected a republican president and a 
democratic majority in the congress but because all the possible 
solutions are painful ones 
would that it were possible to cut some large item in the budget 
labeled waste fraud and unnecessary spending some such 
dollars doubtless exist but they are buried in items that have 
strong support for good reasons 
the budget cannot be cut in sufficient amounts to eliminate the 
deficit except by reducing programs and benefits that some people 
feel they want and need or by raising revenues 
hence a strong bipartisan effort is needed to divide the pain 
to explain why it is necessary and to build a national willingness 
to accept some short run hardships in the interest of a healthier 
economy in the longer run

an investment group seeking to buy interco inc 
for 27 billion has abandoned its tender offer after the st 
louisbased retailer and manufacturer failed to meet the groups 
deadline to begin takeover negotiations 
cardinal acquisition corp the washingtonbased group controlled 
by mitchell and steven rales had said it would drop its 
74pershare cash offer at midnight wednesday and return all 
tendered shares if interco did not agree to give cardinal 
confidential corporate information or enter into buyout talks 
the raleses offer had attracted tenders for 92 percent of 
intercos 3556 million outstanding shares 
intercos stock price fell 187 a share to 6337 in composite 
new york stock exchange trading on wednesday as traders anticipated 
an end to the raleses bid 
an interco spokesman said the company would proceed with its 
plans for a 28 billion restructuring that was valued at 76 a 
share including a 3080 onetime cash and securities dividend to 
shareholders 
however the legal maneuvering resulting from the bid was not 
over 
the delaware supreme court is scheduled to consider on nov 30 an 
appeal of a lower court ruling that declared intercos poison 
pill takeover defense illegal 
interco shareholders also have filed suits against the company 
charging they were denied the full value of their stock by 
managements refusal to accept the raleses bid 
a spokesman for the raleses declined comment on their future 
plans 
however the wall street journal reported today there were 
indications the brothers might increase their holdings in interco 
lawyers for interco told the journal they had been notified the 
raleses were seeking federal clearance to acquire more shares in the 
company 
the raleses currently own 32 million or 87 percent of 
intercos stock 
interco has rebuffed the brothers overtures since their initial 
64ashare offer in july 
the restructuring plan which would put interco deeply into debt 
would result in the sale of its ethan allen furniture division and 
other assets 
other interco lines include florsheim shoes converse sneakers 
and london fog outerwear 
interco employs about 54000 people nationwide and had sales of 
334 billion last year

pernod ricard sa apparently won thursday a 
monthslong takeover battle for irish distillers group plc 
irelands biggest whiskey maker when britains panel on takeovers 
and mergers said the bidder had not breached any takeover rules 
that means pernods offer of 285 million irish punts or 450 
irish pence a share apparently prevails over grand metropolitan 
plcs higher offer of 322 million punts or 525 irish pence a share 
pernods bid is the equivalent of 442 million 
irish distillers shares fell 46 british pence to 378 pence on 
londons stock exchange following the announcement 
pernod is obviously pleased that the ruling has gone its way 
and looks forward to completing the offer said a pernod spokesman 
in london adding that the french liquor company currently holds 
more than 53 percent of irish distillers shares 
the spokesman who was not identified in accordance with british 
practice said he was confident pernod would obtain clearance from 
the irish ministry of industry and commerce which is investigating 
the offer on competitive public interest regional employment and 
other grounds 
the british takeover panel was ruling on whether pernod 
improperly obtained binding agreements from some irish distillers 
shareholders 
pernod has previously said it would release shareholders from 
these commitments if the panel ruled against the french company but 
the panel in a lengthy statement said pernod wouldnt be obliged 
to do so 
grand met spokesman tim halford said the british company had no 
intention of disposing of its 251 percent holding in irish 
distillers 
were actively buying shares at the moment to reaffirm our 
interest in irish distillers halford said 
analysts said grand mets next move as a minority shareholder 
likely would be an attempt to negotiate the purchase of one of irish 
distillers whiskey brands or even a joint venture agreement with 
pernod 
irish distillers brands include jamesons and paddy whiskeys 
grand met have said all along that they were interested in an 
internationally known whiskey brand said ron littleboy an 
analyst with nomura research institute in london

housing construction soared 72 percent in 
october the sharpest increase in eight months with all regions of 
the nation posting gains except the northeast the government said 
today 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 155 million units last 
month up from a 145 million rate in september 
the big gain followed a revised 08 percent decline in september 
and a 11 percent drop in august previously the department said 
housing starts increased 15 percent in september and fell 31 
percent in august 
the october jump the biggest since a 99 percent increase in 
february suprised analysts who were expecting a decline of about 1 
percent 
housing starts have been subject to a relatively large 
fluctuation in recent months white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said adding that the rebound last month puts the level 
of housing starts at 63 percent above the third quarter average 
starts in october still remain approximately 5 percent below last 
years average so on the whole its good news 
the housing start statistic is historically very volatile and 
early estimates are often sharply revised as the government collects 
more data 
the increase last month can be explained at least in part by 
mortgage interest rates which fell steadily from midaugust through 
early november but have since started to creep higher 
the federal home loan mortgage corp said 30year fixed rate 
mortgages averaged 1024 percent last week excluding special addon 
fees known as points that was down from a peak this year of 1071 
percent in august 
singlefamily homes in october were built at an annual rate of 
115 million units up 100 percent following a 33 percent decline 
a month earlier 
apartment construction was up a scant 02 percent to 408000 
units in october after rising 63 percent in september 
building permits a good indicator of future housing activity 
shot up 74 percent in october to an annual rate of 150 million 
units the highest since september 1987 permits had fallen 48 
percent a month earlier 
by region housing starts shot up 15 percent in the west to 
498000 units rose 76 percent in the midwest to 268000 units 
climbed 46 percent in the south to 586000 units and fell 24 
percent in the northeast to 202000 
for the first 10 months of the year housing starts were running 
96 percent behind the same period of 1987 the peak year for 
housing construction during the current economic expansion was 1986 
when 181 million units were started starts fell to 162 million 
last year are expected to hit 145 million this year and decline 
further next year

grain and soybean futures opened lower today on 
the chicago board of trade in continued selling that analysts said 
was linked to disappointment over the slow pace of grain sales for 
export 
prices of grain and soybean futures have been in a downtrend 
since last thursday one day after the agriculture department 
revised upward its 1988 production estimates for corn and soybeans 
the usda report signaled that prices would have to drop to 
encourage more foreign buying said cathy leow assistant vice 
president of grain futures trading with thomson mckinnon securities 
inc in new york 
it basically told anyone still friendly to the market no way 
buddy at least not in the short term demand has got to get a lot 
larger 
i think people are just basically giving up on a lot of 
positions theyve held for quite a while she said 
in early trading wheat was 2 cents lower to cent higher with 
the contract for delivery in december at 408 a bushel corn was 
1 cents to 2 cents lower with december at 261 a bushel oats

the epic takeover battle for rjr nabisco inc has 
been muddled further by forstmann little amp cos announcement that 
it will not submit a bid for the food and tobacco giant 
forstmann little a corporate buyout specialist stated wednesday 
that the investor group it led had decided that consistent with 
its investment criteria it will not submit a proposal 
the groups decision left two major known suitors for rjr 
nabisco which is accepting sealed bids from prospective buyers 
until friday and caused nabiscos stock to tumble on speculation 
that the bidding war may go no higher 
at the same time a possible new bid may emerge from a group 
consisting of first boston corp and resource holdings ltd a new 
york investment banking concern backed by the wealthy pritzker 
family of chicago and billionaire investor philip anschutz of 
denver the wall street journal reported today 
quoting unidentified sources the newspaper said the first boston 
group had advanced a vague proposal that called for payment at least 
partly in securities instead of cash no amount was disclosed and 
the proposal was given a dim chance of success the journal said 
officials at resource holdings declined comment first boston 
officials did not immediately return phone calls this morning 
there are 20 different scenarios on how this could shape up 
said mary english a food industry analyst with the investment firm 
of furman selz after forstmann littles announcement wednesday 
the takeover maneuvering was further complicated by a major 
lawsuit filed against rjr nabisco management today in new york by 
metropolitan life insurance co a big holder of the companys bonds 
the suit claims the buyout strategies pursued by management have 
devastated the value of those bonds because they raise the prospect 
of nearly quadrupling rjr nabiscos debt 
it was the second such court action filed in two days and 
reflected a growing rebellion of bondholders against debtfinanced 
takeovers on tuesday itt corp another big holder of rjr nabisco 
bonds sued the company on grounds its portfolio has been hurt rjr 
has declined comment on the suits 
before rjr nabiscos special committee of outside directors 
implemented bidding procedures on nov 7 two offers had been made 
public a 203 billion or 90ashare bid from the investment 
firm kohlberg kravis roberts inc and a 207 billion or 
92ashare offer by an investment group led by rjr nabiscos top 
managers 
although there are prospects that the two bidders could make a 
joint offer for the company previous attempts to do so have broken 
down 
and wednesdays announcement came as a disappointment to 
investors because that knocks out one of three that could have 
afforded something of this magnitude ms english said 
forstmann little had said any proposal it made would top the 
management and kohlberg kravis offers 
rjr nabisco stock dropped 450 a share to 84 in new york stock 
exchange composite trading wednesday 
forstmann littles announcement came three weeks after it held 
talks with the rjr nabisco management group and considered joining 
that bid for the company it then assembled a rival group consisting 
of procter amp gamble co ralston purina co castle amp cooke inc and 
goldman sachs amp co 
rjr nabiscos president f ross johnson who leads the managers 
trying to buy the company has the backing of the investment firms 
shearson lehman hutton inc and salomon brothers inc 
when the rjr nabisco board committee announced it would take 
sealed bids for the company it also said it was considering the 
possible sale of the firms food businesses in advance of any 
takeover 
the proceeds of any sale would be paid to shareholders before any 
acquisition of rjr nabisco the committee said 
the food businesses accounted for about 60 percent of the 
companys 158 billion in 1987 net sales industry analysts have 
estimated the businesses would bring a sale price ranging from 125 
billion to 155 billion 
atlantabased rjr nabisco makes such wellknown brands as winston 
and camel cigarettes oreo cookies and del monte vegetables 
if any bidder succeeded in buying the entire company it would be 
the biggest corporate acquisition ever the rjr nabisco management 
and kohlberg kravis bids already dwarf the 134 billion spent in 
the 1984 acquisition of gulf oil corp by what is now chevron corp

plessey co plc a giant electronics company which 
became the target of a hostile takeover bid on wednesday reported 
thursday its firsthalf earnings rose 6 percent constrained by 
recent acquisitions of its own 
general electric co plc and siemens ag launched a joint 17 
billionpound or 31 billion bid wednesday for plessey which 
emphatically rejected the offer 
separately in brussels thursday the european commission said 
european economic community antitrust officials would look into the 
proposed merger between the three european electronics giants 
a commission spokesman said the combination would be an 
operation of a european dimension and therefore of interest to the 
eec antitrust officials under the eec treaty the commission is 
empowered to probe whether mergers satisfy competition rules 
in its earnings statement which made no mention of the bid 
plessey said its earnings for the six months ended sept 30 came to 
473 million pounds compared with 446 million pounds in the same 
period a year earlier 
revenue climbed 148 percent to 6926 million pounds from 6034 
million pounds 
the results were at the bottom end of a range of analysts 
forecasts 
the important steps of the period under review give me 
encouragement to confirm my belief that we are back on the growth 
path said plessey chairman sir john clark 
i must emphasize however that much remains to be done in 
integrating our acquisitions he said 
a priority within the company is to accelerate the benefits of 
the acquisition program while at the same time reducing debt service 
cost 
recent plessey acquisitions have included usbased electronic 
systems division purchased from singer co for 310 million and 
hoskyns group plc a british computer services concern bought for 
164 million pounds 
these purchases have raised plesseys interest payments cutting 
into the companys profit it said

do regulatory and judicial limitations on insider 
trading include the activities of corporate officers who plot to 
take over the company for their own benefit rather than that of 
investors 
apparently not the lack of attention to such activities suggests 
to some critics that corporate insiders may have found the best deal 
for themselves since at least the early 1930s and maybe since the 
turn of the century 
executives are the ultimate insiders not only do they have 
access to secrets sales expectations new products longterm 
prospects they have the power to do things with those secrets 
in contrast most of those recently prosecuted as insiders have 
been relatively passive making money by investing and then waiting 
for others to put into motion the corporate changes that would make 
prices rise 
executive insiders have both the information and the means to 
make things happen and those two factors are involved in almost 
every instance when they make a leveraged buyout offer to their own 
shareholders 
the situation seems to be stirring more anger among bedazzled 
shareholders than among regulators and that stirring in letters 
to newspapers among investment groups in shareholder conversations 
may erupt in legal action 
among questions commonly being discussed 
were corporate officers managers paid by the shareholders 
looking after their own or the shareholders interests 
did they maneuver the companys activities for their own or 
shareholder interest 
were they direct in their communications with investors 
employees and their own boards of directors who are committed by 
law to the shareholders interests or did they purposely withold 
information on their intentions 
at the extreme is the question of whether managements have 
actively plotted to maintain corporate operations at a depressed 
level in order to obtain a low buyout price knowing they could 
improve operations at a later date 
individual shareholders have been weak in dealing with such 
matters over the years but in the past decade or so they have 
become better organized into effective forces 
more significant however has been the growth of institutions 
which now do most of the stock trading on organized exchanges and 
constitute enormous concentrations of funds for credit markets 
some of these institutions such as pension funds and college 
endowments have seen the value of their bond investments plumment 
after the management of companies in which they invested announced 
leveraged buyout plans 
the demoralizing impact on bond prices generally has not received 
the same publicity afforded the runup in stock prices but the bond 
market impact has been severe new debt needed to accomplish a 
leveraged buyout causes the value of existing bonds to decline 
badly affecting the bond portfolios of investors 
one such bondholder itt corp filed suit this week against rjr 
nabisco inc claiming rjr management failed to disclose it was 
considering a leveraged buyout when it sold rjr bonds to itt last 
april itt lost heavily 
while some buyouts and unfriendly takeovers can have beneficial 
effects for the company its shareholders employees and community 
a large percentage of them lead to fractured feelings portfolios 
and even the companies themselves 
while it might seem that laws and regulations on insider 
activities would apply events suggest it is a nomans land 
it might take a series of these events such as itts suit to 
clarify matters and provide rules and guidance where they seem not 
to exist

the battered dollar rebounded in early trading today bolstered 
by a wave of coordinated dollar purchases by central banks while 
the stock market struggled to its feet after a sharp drop on 
wednesday 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials which has fallen nearly 
89 points over the previous six sessions was up 747 points at 
204605 at noon on wall street 
the dollar was quoted at around 12268 japanese yen in new york 
trading up from 12224 yen late wednesday that had been the us 
currencys lowest close against the yen in new york trading since 
modern exchange rates were established in the late 1940s 
the government reported today that housing construction jumped 
72 percent in october the biggest increase in eight months 
the commerce department said new homes and apartments were built 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 155 million units last 
month up from a 145 million rate in september all regions of the 
nation except the northeast had posted gains it said 
the huge increase followed a revised 08 percent decline in 
september and a 11 percent drop in august previously the 
department said housing starts increased 15 percent in september 
and fell 31 percent in august 
the october jump was the biggest since a 99 percent increase in 
february analysts had been expecting a decline of about 1 percent 
in another report wednesday the commerce department said the 
us trade deficit narrowed by 17 percent in september to 105 
billion but the figures refused to calm jittery financial markets 
the dollar plunged wednesday bond prices slid and the stock 
market tumbled to a 2month low in response to the report which 
indicated a smaller decline in the deficit than was expected by many 
market participants and analysts 
the dollar registered its lowest close against the japanese yen 
in new york trading since modern exchange rates were established in 
the late 1940s falling nearly 1 percent to 12224 yen 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks dropped 3859 
points to 203858 its lowest close since it stood at 200231 on 
sept 1 
overall exports rose in september by 700 million to a record 
high 282 billion the commerce department said imports declined 
by 25 percent or 11 billion to 387 billion from a record high 
in august 
the 105 billion trade gap for september was down by 18 
billion from the revised august trade deficit figure of 123 
billion 
but neither change was big enough to stem a new selling wave of 
dollars by traders who were worried about inflation from an 
overheating economy and skeptical of presidentelect george bushs 
promise to reduce the federal budget deficit without any tax 
increases 
many analysts had expected the trade deficit to drop below 10 
billion in september as it did in may and july 
when it did not more general concerns over the federal 
budget deficit and the willingness of foreigners to keep financing 
us consumer habits triggered wednesdays selling spree on 
financial markets said david wyss chief financial economist for 
data resources inc of lexington mass 
exports were up imports were down the reaction should have 
been positive wyss said although the trade deficit has 
improved the improvement seems to have stalled out at about 11 
billion deficit a month add to that figures on growth that weve 
seen in the past couple of weeks and the market has good reason to 
be pessimistic 
in other economic developments wednesday 
the federal reserve board reported that the operating rate at 
us factories mines and utilities in october rose to the highest 
level in 8 years 
the commerce department said business inventories rose sharply 
relative to sales in september a sign of economic weakness 
analysts discounted the significance of the report noting that 
sales have picked up since then 
the value of us agricultural exports jumped 26 percent to a 
fouryear high of 352 billion in the fiscal year that ended sept 
30 the agriculture department reported

the us dollar ended slightly higher in hectic 
european trading thursday pushed up by reported intervention by 
us and european central banks 
gold prices fell 
the bank of japan intervened heavily during the tokyo trading 
day but the intervention was largely shrugged off by the market 
dealers said 
the us federal reserve began to buy dollars for yen in the new 
york morning and the dollarbuying spree was quickly bolstered by 
the entry of the deutsche bundesbank and then the british swiss 
french italian austrian and other central banks dealers said 
the bundesbanks participation added a lot of weight to the round 
of intervention since this is the first time the west german 
central bank has intervened in the dollars latest downward move 
dealers said 
the intervention appeared to be moderate but was spread widely 
among banks in order to have the biggest impact possible for the 
amount of money spent they said 
dealers said they had expected concerted intervention to 
materialize especially after so many warnings in recent days by top 
monetary officials who either reiterated their desire for exchange 
rate stability or said they werent in favor of a lower dollar 
but although the intervention was expected to keep the dollar 
steady for a while dealers say they will soon be looking for a 
chance to sell dollars again

in a unique 10year deal los angeles county 
is borrowing 100 million from two japanese lenders in what 
officials described as a first between a foreign nation and a local 
government entity 
the county will borrow 100 million in yen under the arrangement 
with the nippon life insurance co and the long term credit bank of 
japan ltd 
this is our first borrowing in a foreign market and the first 
state or local government borrowing of this nature county chief 
administrative officer richard b dixon said from tokyo on wednesday 
we have been shopping for opportunities in the taxable market 
and this is the first and best opportunity we have found said 
dixon 
the county will invest the funds in highgrade debt 
securities and use the profits to help reduce the unfunded 
liability in the employees retirement system dixon said 
dixon said a currency swap agreement will also allow the county 
to repay the loan in dollars rather than yen as a hedge against any 
risks if the foreign currency fluctuates 
because of the 1986 tax reform act the county has been seeking 
alternatives to the domestic market the law eliminated local 
governments ability to issue taxexempt pension bonds 
additionally interest rates are lower dixon said the loan will 
be repaid in dollars at the 10year us treasury note rate now 
901 percent plus 58 percent at todays rates these percentages 
are lower than the us prime rate of 10 percent

the decision by continental airlines and other 
us carriers to boost most of their lowest discount fares reflects 
current strength in passenger traffic analysts say 
several major airlines said wednesday and today that they were 
following continentals revamping of the popular fares used by most 
vacation travelers united airlines the nations largest carrier 
is matching continentals action throughout its route system said 
spokeswoman sara dornacker in chicago she said the average increase 
on the socalled maxsavers to be hiked would be around 15 each way 
other airlines matching the maxsaver changes through their entire 
systems include american airlines delta air lines and trans world 
airlines inc 
northwest airlines partially followed the action changing around 
30000 maxsaver fares between different cities said northwest 
spokesman red tyler in eagan minn he said the continental changes 
involve more than 100000 such fares 
we continue to review the others tyler said there is 
still indecision in the industry 
houstonbased continental notified travel agents on tuesday night 
and wednesday that it would revamp its maxsaver program to base 
fares on the length of a flight competition on individual routes 
not mileage had determined the fares in the past 
under the new formula due to take effect next wednesday 
maxsaver fares for longer flights generally would be raised while 
those for shorter hauls would mostly be reduced 
the changes apparently raised about roughly twothirds of 
continentals maxsaver fares and cut the remaining maxsavers 
they followed by a few days plans initiated by continental and 
matched by other big airlines to drop another category of discount 
air fares the junk fares available four to seven days before a 
flight and used mainly by business travelers 
like continental most of northwests fare changes were 
increases tyler said he said northwest so far has only matched 
continental in the markets where the two airlines compete directly 
in other markets northwest will wait to see whether the other 
carriers follow continentals lead tyler said 
the hikes in both advancepurchase maxsavers and lastminute junk 
fares reflect the recent trend toward higher air fares propelled by 
increasing passenger traffic 
consumers definitely are paying higher prices said andrew 
geller an airline analyst at provident national bank in 
philadelphia 
airline fares are up an average 8 percent from a year ago he 
said 
continental which customarily has been a pacesetter in cutting 
fares has started to enjoy stronger traffic allowing it to switch 
directions 
the airline used to slash fares to attract more passengers and 
its moves quickly were mimicked by the other big carriers in an 
effort to remain competitive now continentals improving traffic 
has made it a leader in fare hikes rather than cuts at least for 
the moment 
that has allowed continental to switch its emphasis from filling 
seats with cheap fares to offering better service said ned walker 
a spokesman for the airline 
service has the utmost attention at continental he said 
after safety the focus is on service 
walker cited monthly statistics compiled by the department of 
transportation showing recent improvements in continentals ontime 
performance and other aspects of its service 
continental may be trying to position itself in the 
priceservice array by getting closer to full fares suggested 
john pincavage who follows the industry for painewebber inc 
he said the big test of the airlines strength will come in 
january and february when passenger traffic is seasonally weak

soybean futures plunged to their lowest prices in 
more than six months thursday after cracking an important technical 
resistance point 
the grain markets followed soybeans lower with corn futures also 
posting steep losses 
soybean prices had opened modestly lower in a continuation of the 
downward trend that had characterized the market since late last 
week analysts linked the early selling to heavy showers overnight 
in soybeanproducing areas of south america and to the relatively 
slow pace of soybean sales for export 
but analysts said selling accelerated as soybeans for delivery in 
november approached 740 a bushel the low of the markets last 
significant bottom on july 28 and speculators pushed the price 
through that important barrier 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 6 cents lower with december 
at 409 a bushel corn was 2 cents to 4 cents lower with december 
at 259 a bushel oats were 2 cents lower to 1 cents higher with 
december at 203 a bushel and soybeans were 17 cents to 25 cents 
lower with november at 719 a bushel

a union leader was angered to learn that eastern 
airlines which must request rescheduling of 300 million in loans 
has made multimilliondollar payments to its nonunion sister 
carrier continental airlines 
were talking about 50 million more that is being upstreamed 
and yet they continue going out and telling the world this horror 
story about their financial problems charles e bryan told a 
meeting of labor leaders wednesday 
bryan is president of the machinists local at eastern the 
airlines largest union eastern and continental are both 
subsidiaries of texas air corp the nations biggest airline 
company 
easterns latest quarterly filing with the securities and 
exchange commission showed it paid continental 175 million in 
september for frequent flier redemptions it also paid 19 million 
to houstonbased continental for strike contingency services 
bryan also was critical of a 211 million loan from eastern to 
bar harbour airlines a commuter carrier that is another texas air 
subsidiary 
eastern spokesman robin matell called the 175 million frequent 
flier payment to continental a perfectly legitimate transaction 
under the two airlines joint frequent flier program because more 
eastern frequent fliers were redeeming their award certificates with 
continental than the other way around 
texas air announced recently that the strike contingency program 
is being discontinued because management doesnt consider an eastern 
strike likely easterns machinists and management have been in 
federal mediation over the unions contract since january 
bryan and other union leaders at eastern say texas air chairman 
frank lorenzo has been bleeding away easterns assets since he took 
control two years ago eastern has paid texas air tens of millions 
of dollars in management fees along with fees for use of the 
computerized reservations system that formerly belonged to eastern 
and is a separate texas air subsidiary 
bryan has urged lorenzo to sell eastern to an employeebacked 
group financier carl icahn the owner and chairman of trans world 
airlines inc recently expressed interest in buying eastern and met 
with representatives of the machinists and other eastern unions 
easterns sec report also said texas air paid 16 million in 
expenses to eastern left over from its 1986 takeover 
eastern awaiting government approval of a 365 million sale of 
its northeastern shuttle to new york developer donald trump said it 
must make such asset sales to stay alive unless it can reduce labor 
costs eastern has reported 233 million in net losses in the first 
three quarters of this year 
eastern officials plan to meet friday with french british and 
west german lenders to renegotiate the airlines debt payments to 
avoid a technical default that could result in lenders demanding 
quicker payments of the loans 
this situation has happened in the past said eastern 
spokeswoman karen ceremsak we dont expect it to be a problem

one of the most pronounced rounds of central bank 
intervention since spring helped stem the dollars slide thursday 
but some analysts said the currency would need more help before it 
stabilizes 
gold prices dipped republic national bank of new york said gold 
bullion was bid at 41975 an ounce at 4 pm est down from 42360 
late wednesday 
traders said the central banks stepped into the foreign exchange 
markets in force to buy up dollars a day after the us currency had 
sunk to near historic lows 
in tokyo where the trading day begins the dollar fell to 12152 
yen nearly a 40year low despite heavy intervention by the bank of 
japan 
later in london the dollar moved to 12265 yen and then in new 
york it settled at 122155 yen off slightly from late wednesdays 
12224 
the dollars lack of response against the yen was attributed to 
the frequency of the bank of japans recent intervention in the 
market buying by european central banks which intensified through 
the day was more unusual and helped the us currency move higher 
against most other major currencies in late new york trading 
the participation of the bundesbank was particularly important 
since it was the first time west germanys central bank had 
intervened in the dollars recent decline traders noted 
it was the most widespread intervention in the market since a big 
selloff of dollars last april in reaction to a bad monthly trade 
report 
although the trade deficit showed modest improvement in the 
latest report issued wednesday the dollar sustained heavy losses 
nonetheless wednesdays slide convinced some traders that 
intervention by the central banks was inevitable 
the market had been expecting it for some time said stephen 
leach currency analyst for chemical bank in new york the 
question was when 
leach noted the timing of the intervention also coincided with 
the treasurys auction of 9 billion in new 30year bonds thursday 
some analysts who follow the credit markets had feared that the 
dollars recent weakness would scare foreign investors away from the 
auction 
but analysts said more intervention would be necessary to 
stabilize the dollar the market is also looking for clear policy 
statements from presidentelect george bush on what his 
administration will do to cut the trade and budget deficits 
worries about the twin deficits have kept pressure on the dollar 
since the election was decided last week 
the dollar fell against the british pound in london where it 
cost 18227 to buy one pound more than late wednesdays 18225 
but the pound fetched 182875 in late new york trading less than 
183375 late wednesday

opec oil ministers gathered thursday to 
start a series of meetings considered crucial to capping the 
cartels runaway production and bolstering world crude prices 
but analysts and industry experts have expressed skepticism that 
the meetings would produce a substantive accord leading to immediate 
or longlasting output restraints 
doubts grew when ministers adjourned after an hour saying they 
would hold separate talks on friday and possibly reconvene again on 
saturday 
eight ministers from opecs price and strategy committees were 
faced with the tough problem of designing a new production agreement 
that would allot quotas under a formula acceptable to all members 
the committees recommendations are to be presented to a full 
meeting of the organization of petroleum exporting countries when 
oil ministers from all 13 nations gather on monday 
indonesian energy minister ginandjar kartasasmita told reporters 
he was optimistic the ministers would succeed in their task 
ginandjar who recently visited some of the other cartel 
countries said everybody expressed their concern for the 
level of prices which have hurt their economies 
he said he was hopeful that all parties will do their best to 
reach a solution adding there is ground for negotiation and 
for eventual agreement 
but he acknowledged the going would not be easy we have to 
work very hard he said 
industry experts however have said they doubt the meetings will 
produce results this time around 
opec remains in disarray and the likelihood of market stability 
at reasonable oil price levels appears less promising today than it 
did a year ago richard m morrow chairman of the american 
petroleum institute told a gathering of analyts and experts this 
week 
morrow said that even if opec reaches an agreement on new quotas 
the industry is skeptical it will last for more than a few months 
if that long 
adding to the skepticism were reports this week that some senior 
opec officials were already looking beyond the current talks to 
possible meetings next year to resolve the quota dispute between 
iran and iraq which is considered the main stumbling block to an 
accord 
a key problem facing the ministers is bringing iraq back into the 
quota system 
opec set production ceilings based on a december 1986 arrangement 
limiting total output at about 15 million barrels a day that 
excludes iraq which has ignored its quota because it was not given 
parity with iran its foe in an eightyear war that ended with a 
ceasefire in august 
analysts say most of the cartel members have exceeded their 
quotas in recent months adding to the glut in the world market 
prices have fallen to 4 or more below the cartels benchmark 
price of 18 per 42gallon barrel 
the international energy agency estimated in its monthly oil 
market report that the cartels production jumped to almost 211 
million barrels a day in october the highest monthly output in more 
than five years 
analysts differ on the amount that opec would have to reduce its 
output to eliminate the excess and boost oil prices with opinions 
ranging from 2 million to 4 million barrels a day 
iraq in refusing its quota of 15 million barrels a day said it 
wanted to have the same ceiling of 24 million barrels as iran 
since the ceasefire went into effect negotiations have been under 
way to bring iraq back into the quota system 
iraqi oil minister issam abdul raheem alchalabi told reporters 
before the closeddoor meeting began thursday its very clear our 
position hasnt changed 
iran had proposed that its quota reflect a higher domestic demand 
of some 1 million barrels a day iraqi internal demand is estimated 
at 300000 barrels a day the source said 
analysts estimate iraq has been producing at least 26 million 
barrels a day an amount that could hit 37 million barrels next 
year with completion of a new pipeline through saudi arabia to the 
red sea

than six months thursday after cracking an important resistance 
point 
on other markets grain cotton precious metals energy 
livestock meat and stockindex futures all were lower while copper 
futures advanced 
soybeans for delivery in november settled at 719 a bushel on 
the chicago board of trade a loss of 25 cents from wednesdays 
final price it was the lowest settlement price for a nearmonth 
soybean contract since may 13 when the may contract finished at 
719 
soybean prices had opened modestly lower in a continuation of the 
downward trend that has characterized the market since late last 
week analysts linked the early selling to heavy showers overnight 
in soybeanproducing areas of south america and to the relatively 
slow pace of soybean sales for export 
but selling accelerated as november soybeans approached 740 a 
bushel a price not seen since july 28 and speculators pushed the 
price through that important barrier 
when you hit that level you started seeing a lot of 
liquidation in the market said cathy leow an assistant vice 
president of thomson mckinnon securities inc in new york 
wheat settled 1 cents to 6 cents lower with the contract for 
delivery in december at 409 a bushel corn was 3 cents to 5 
cents lower with december at 259 a bushel oats were cents to 
1 cents lower with december at 204 a bushel and soybeans were 
17 cents to 25 cents lower with november at 719 a bushel

exchange in a technically inspired selloff

the fundamentals have been bearish for a long time he said 
weve got large crops throughout the world and we have a slower 
offtake from existing stocks than we had last season in spite of 
that the market has gone up and stayed up now its finally coming 
down he said 
cotton settled 15 cents to 175 cents lower with december at 
5320 cents a pound 
copper futures rebounded strongly on new yorks commodity 
exchange after falling for four of the five previous sessions 
analysts attributed the rise to renewed supply concerns prompted 
by reports of production problems at a stateowned mine in chile and 
the terrorist bombing of the peruvian mine owners association 
offices in lima peru 
copper settled 15 cents to 53 cents higher with december at 
1333 a pound

silver settled 11 cents to 118 cents lower with december at 
619 a troy ounce gold was 4 to 450 lower with december at 
42110 a troy ounce

meetings on capping their runaway production

cattle futures fell sharply late in the session on the chicago 
mercantile exchange pressured by aggressive speculative selling on

expectations of a seasonal decline in demand for beef also 
contributed to the selloff 
a surge of lastminute selling drove hog futures to a sharply 
lower close while weakening cash markets weighed on both the hogs 
and the pork bellies analysts said 
live cattle settled 50 cent to 117 cents lower with december at 
7267 cents a pound feeder cattle were 02 cent to 75 cent lower 
with november at 8167 cents a pound live hogs were 38 cent to

the united states and its major economic allies 
successfully intervened thursday to halt a slide in the value of the 
dollar but economists predicted that the federal reserve will be 
forced to boost us interest rates in a further defense of the 
beleaguered us greenback 
the coordinated intervention in the currency markets by the 
united states japan west germany england france italy and 
canada was the most widespread dollar rescue effort since last april 
when the markets were stampeded into a dollar selloff following a 
bad monthly trade report 
despite the success of thursdays rescue effort many traders 
foresaw renewed selling pressure in the months ahead because of 
fears that presidentelect george bush and the new congress will be 
unable to reach agreement on ways to trim the budget deficit 
investors are concerned that the enlarged democratic majorities 
in congress and bushs tough notax stance guarantee further 
budgetary gridlock 
for this reason many economists predicted the federal reserve 
will be forced in coming weeks to begin pushing interest rates 
higher in the united states some analysts said they would not rule 
out an increase in the discount rate the interest the fed charges 
to make loans to member banks 
a boost in the discount rate is the most dramatic signal the fed 
can send of its intention of driving interest rates higher 
higher interest rates make dollardenominated investments more 
attractive to foreigners and help relieve the pressure to sell off 
such assets higher interest rates also dampen inflationary 
pressures brought on by a weaker currency 
intervention is the process by which the federal reserve or other 
countries central banks buy and sell currencies in an attempt to 
influence the market price 
the intervention thursday was begun by the bank of japan which 
started buying dollars after the us currency fell to near 40year 
lows in trading in tokyo 
after the initial purchases by the bank of japan currency 
traders reported that the central banks of the major european allies 
of the united states bought dollars followed by buying by the us 
central bank 
the concerted dollarbuying helped to push the us currency up 
to 122155 yen at the close of trading in new york off slightly 
from wednesdays close of 12354 yen it had closed at 12152 yen in 
tokyo after having dropped as low as 12130 during the tokyo 
trading day 
but traders said they doubted the joint intervention effort would 
have more than a temporary restaining effect on the downward 
pressure on the dollar 
this will only provide temporary relief said william hand a 
trader at first pennsylvania bank in philadelphia the market 
wants to see some concrete kind of plan on how the budget deficit is 
going to be solved 
robert hormats an economist with goldman sachs predicted that 
the currency markets and the stock and bond markets would continue 
to be in turmoil between now and bushs inauguration on jan 20 
i think the market has confidence in the economic team bush is 
putting together but the market is impatient because the budget and 
trade imbalances are so big he said 
market unrest already has prompted bush and treasury secretary 
nicholas brady who will stay on in the bush administration to 
issue reassuring statements that the new administration considers 
cutting the budget deficit to be a top priority 
on wednesday federal reserve chairman alan greenspan added the 
strongest voice yet to calls for urgent action on the deficit 
telling the national economic commission that the deficit which 
climbed to 1551 billion in the last fiscal year already has 
begun to eat away at the foundations of our economic strength 
however bush spokeswoman sheila tate asked about greenspans 
warning said economists never agree on anything for every 
economist you cite we can trot out one who is diametrically in 
opposition 
david wyss chief financial economist for data resources inc 
called tates remarks on abctvs good morning america 
surprising given the need for the new administration to present a 
united front with the central bank to reassure jittery markets 
the market right now is looking for some reassurance that 
something is going to be done about the federal budget deficit and 
about the trade deficit wyss said they are afraid that the 
bush administration is more willing to solve the deficit by letting 
the dollar fall than by cutting the budget deficit 
while a weaker dollar makes us goods less expensive on overseas 
markets and imports more expensive for americans bush has insisted 
that he does not plan to abandon the twoyear reagan effort to 
stabilize the dollars value 
wyss said that with the uncertainty in currency markets the fed 
soon will start pushing interest rates higher 
i think the fed will have to let interest rates edge upward 
he said predicting that tighter monetary policy could trigger an 
increase in banks prime lending rate by next month 
lyle gramley a former member of the fed board and now chief 
economist of the mortgage bankers association said the central bank 
was likely to make behindthescenes moves to nudge rates higher in 
coming weeks but would wait until january for something as dramatic 
as a boost in the discount rate unless the dollar threatened to 
tumble into a freefall 
they would like to wait before tightening further but the 
exchange markets may force the feds hand he said

bond prices fell thursday pressured by the 
weaker dollar and growing concerns about inflation 
the treasurys closely watched 30year bond declined 2132 point 
or about 650 for every 1000 of face value 
its yield which moves inversely to its price and is a key 
indicator of interest rate trends rose to 917 percent from 911 
percent late wednesday 
analysts said bond prices continued to weaken in the face of a 
declining us currency 
the bond market took its cue from the dollar said irwin l 
kellner chief economist at manufacturers hanover trust co 
also contributing to weaker bond prices was a government report 
that housing construction in october posted the biggest increase in 
eight months the commerce department said new construction rose 72 
percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 155 
million units from its september level 
both a weaker dollar and stronger housing statistics suggest 
stronger inflationary pressures inflation erodes the value of bonds 
meanwhile the treasury sold 9 billion in 30year bonds at an 
average yield of 910 percent down from 917 percent at the last 
30year auction on may 12 it was the lowest rate since 30year 
bonds averaged 851 percent at the feb 4 auction 
the 30year bond auction was postponed for a week because the 
treasury previously had sold nearly as many of the bonds as congress 
had authorized 
but tax legislation signed by president reagan on nov 11 lifted 
the limits paving the way for thursdays auction 
in the secondary market for treasury bonds prices of shortterm 
government issues were 332 to 732 point lower intermediate 
maturities slipped between point and 1532 point and 20year 
issues lost point according to figures provided by telerate inc 
a financial information service 
the movement of a point is equivalent to a change of 10 in the 
price of a bond with a 1000 face value 
the shearson lehman daily treasury bond index which measures 
price movements on all outstanding treasury issues with maturities 
of a year or longer declined 347 to 113425 
corporate bonds fell moodys investment grade corporate bond 
index which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with 
maturities of five years or longer had edged down 064 to 29360 
municipal bonds held steady the bond buyers municipal bond 
index which measures the prices on 40 longterm bonds was 
unchanged thursday from wednesdays late level 
yields on threemonth treasury bills meanwhile rose to 818 
percent as the discount increased 2 basis points to 792 percent 
yields on sixmonth bills advanced to 840 percent as the discount 
rose 1 basis point to 796 percent yields on oneyear bills rose to 
855 percent as the discount rose 3 basis points to 796 percent 
a basis point is onehundredth of a percentage point the yield 
is the annualized return on an investment in a treasury bill the 
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face 
value which is paid at maturity 
the federal funds rate the interest on overnight loans between 
banks was quoted at 8 percent up from 8 percent late wednesday

there were 28 mergers and acquisitions worth 
1 billion or more through the first three quarters of the year 
indicating 1988 will see a record number of such megadeals 
according figures released thursday by mergers amp acquisitions 
magazine 
the annual record of 31 deals of 1 billion or more was set in 
1986 the magazine stated 
martin sikora editor of the philadelphiabased bimonthly 
journal said the increasing number and magnitude of the deals makes 
it likely they also will beat the annual dollar record of 2064 
billion set two years ago 
the 65 billion acquisition of federated department stores by 
campeau corp was the largest deal completed so far this year 
but with such transactions as the 131 billion acquisition of 
kraft inc by philip morris cos inc and the proposed sale of rjr 
nabisco inc for more than 20 billion in the works the 
campeaufederated deal may not be the largest completed by years 
end 
in the third quarter of this year mampa recorded 791 completed 
mergers acquisitions and divestitures the worth of the 402 deals 
with reported prices totaled 44 billion 
last year during the same period mampa recorded 904 completions 
with a value of 47 billion in the second quarter this year 775 
transactions were recorded with a value of 554 billion 
for the first nine months of this year completed deals totaled 
2493 with a value of 1378 billion for 1225 transactions 
revealing price for the same span of 1987 there were 2797 
transactions and a recorded value of 1258 billion 
one reason for the reduction in the number of transactions is 
that the market is extremely competitive with attractive businesses 
drawing multiple bids sikora said 
this condition has driven up prices forcing some buyers 
temporarily to the sidelines and also has consumed time that active 
buyers may have devoted to more acquisitions he said 
however acquisition interest among all potential buyers 
remains strong and the growth in megadeals points up the abundance 
of financing available to acquirers he said 
foreign acquisitions in the united states totaled 91 with a value 
of 12 billion in the third quarter against 95 worth 119 billion 
in the second quarter and 84 worth 128 billion in the third 
quarter of 1987 
the leveraged buyout market posted 65 thirdquarter completions 
with known value of 76 billion against 61 with a 157 billion 
value in the second quarter leveraged buyouts totaled 62 with a 
97 billion value in the third quarter of 1987
