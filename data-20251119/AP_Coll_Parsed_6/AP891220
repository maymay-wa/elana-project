instead of collapsing when the united 
states threw its military might against gen manuel antonio 
noriega his defense forces stubbornly resisted 
the elusive general the bush administration had hoped to put 
before a federal judge in florida on drug charges remains at large 
and in hiding despite an attack wednesday by thousands of american 
troops 
many in panama had thought the defense forces would simply 
throw down their guns as soon as an american helicopter appeared 
over the barracks as a noriega opponent once put it 
in interviews prior to the attack us military leaders had 
claimed defense forces troops would refuse to shed their blood for 
noriega part of their evidence stemmed from the fact that disloyal 
officers mounted two coups against him 
but the general who sometimes seemed to escape by magic 
apparently retained enough loyalty for his men to put up a fight 
when the us stroke came from defense forces posts all over 
panama came reports of stubborn fighting that lasted for hours 
with their garrisons destroyed or under siege many panamanian 
officers left and joined small paramilitary groups in urban 
guerrilla warfare 
while us forces had heavy artillery and air power to use 
against installations and sent their armored personnel carriers 
rolling over fences and cars panamanian armed groups fought a 
delaying action 
we are acting as urban guerrillas although we have lost some 
positions some garrisons said enrique thompson the second in 
command in the paramilitary groups known as dignity battalions 
thompson spoke with an associated press reporter as the five men 
with him took up positions in the bushes with sovietmade ak47 
rifles near the tinajitas garrison taken over wednesday morning by 
the americans 
the people are joining the struggle for national 
sovereignty he said 
the noriega forces marshalled resistance with appeals over the 
national radio broadcasting in a national network 
announcers called on panamanians to organize neighborhood armed 
resistance and guerrilla war the station played panamanian 
patriotic songs that taunt americans officers even used it to 
broadcast instructions to troops and messages to each other often 
in code 
us forces finally did slowly close down the radio stations 
that made up the chain but it was a slow process 
incredible said a sweaty us army sergeant as he listened 
to the exhortations that was the first thing we should have 
silenced 
unlike the armed forces in other parts of latin america the 
defense forces officer corps is made up largely of men from poor 
backgrounds and became the vehicle dictator omar torrijos used in 
the late 1960s to topple the ruling oligarchy 
noriega a torrijos disciple once observed that the upperclass 
had only itself to blame when they complained about the defense 
forces dominance because they preferred to make money 
he openly mocked the upperclass and his supporters frequently 
refer to the opposition election victory on may 7 as an effort by 
the oligarchy to return to power 
noriega promoted officers with poor backgrounds often from 
discriminatedagainst black and chinese minorities and worked hard 
to retain their loyalty with lucrative slices of the corruption pie 
in panama 
but when that loyalty slipped it did in coup attempts in 1988 
and 1989 he reacted brutally and reports that he personally beat 
or shot coup instigators circulated 
accused of domestic repression by the us government he 
whipped up nationalistic feelings showing himself as a panamanian 
wrongly accused by the large country that wanted to renege on the 
the panama canal treaties 
the invasion was a slap in the face to panamanians who have 
considered themselves friends and allies of the americans since the 
two countries joined hands in the construction of the panama canal 
at the beginning of the century 
as the armored personnel carriers rolled out of fort clayton 
after midnight wednesday past the panamanian town of diablo 
heights some men and women watching them cursed them or cried 
whey are they doing this a housewife asked a reporter 
are they going to kill our people just for one man 
the americans have no control of the situation said dr 
leonardo diaz of the santo tomas hospital their strength is in 
their personnel carriers and their cobras helicopters but the 
people are angry

this first installment of a threepart christmas 
series about the relatives of jesus deals with his ancestral roots 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
everyone is a special sum of ancestry to enhance or diminish 
through a lifetime that was so for the child of christmas the 
product of a heritage 
some biblical passages cloak his origins in utter mystery 
before time itself but others accord him a thoroughly natural 
family tree 
he was in the beginning with god says one account a 
word or logos a vitalizing wisdom inherent in the creator 
before the world began yet other passages say he was made like 
his brethren in every respect 
son of man he usually called himself but also son of 
god 
he combined universality with particularity the divine 
and human model writes church historian jaroslav pelican in his 
book jesus through the centuries it says a key question put to 
him was where do you come from 
although seldom noted he had a long string of forebears as well 
as contemporary relatives who gave him both problems and help his 
lineage ran deep into jewish history 
as with most people if their descent is traced back far enough 
he had a checkered ancestry good and bad the lowly and great 
kings betrayers heroes adulterers warriors and prostitutes 
it was an odd assortment like humanity itself alien gentiles 
and fellow jews the weak and strong upright and corrupt the fact 
that he shared these common roots is considered theologically basic 
to his purpose becoming identified with all humankind 
they were all members of jesus family his greatgreatgreat 
grandaddies and grandmamas in the faith wrote church scholar 
william h willimon for all their weaknesses and shortcomings 
this motley but richly human crew were indeed his people 
two genealogies of jesus are recorded one in the first chapter 
of the book of matthew the other in the third chapter of the book 
of luke they vary in some detail and some interpreters debatably 
assume luke gives the line of his mother mary and that matthew 
gives that of joseph legally the father 
it is possible that the original genealogy did interpret 
joseph as the father of jesus that is that it had been formulated 
before the understanding of jesus as the divinely generated son of 
god writes new testament scholar henrikus boers in his book 
who was jesus 
some progenitors are on both lists including olden patriarchs 
of judaism and israels great king david along with other lesser 
figures of sundry character 
matthew lists 41 ancestors starting back at the time of 
abraham ancient father of israel and other early patriarchs 
isaac and jacob 
luke lists 77 progenitors in reverse order starting with joseph 
and enumerating others going back to the first man adam and 
finally to his creator god 
other figures out of dim antiquity also are included such as 
noah and that legend of longevity methuselah who lived 969 
years all designated ancestors of jesus 
in the mostly male lists four women are named and theyre a 
mixed group a soldiers beautiful wife bathsheba seduced by 
king david the harlot of jericho rahab the sexually maneuvering 
cananite tamar and the loyal mohabite ruth 
tamar was the daugherinlaw of judah son of the patriarch 
jacob her husband died and after prolonged widowhood she 
disguised herself as a prostitute and enticed her fatherinlaw to 
lie with her she bore twins one named perez also among jesus 
forbears 
rahab was a harlot who sheltered two scouts sent by the 
israelite warriorleader joshua to spy out jericho before taking 
it she hid them from searchers in flax stalks on her rooftop 
she later helped the pair escape lowering them on a rope from a 
window in her house which was built into the city wall by 
agreement with the two her clan was spared when jericho was 
destroyed her house marked by a scarlet cord hung from a window 
the devoted woman of moab ruth widowed by her hebrew husband 
insisted on returning with her motherinlaw naomi to israel 
with these memorable words for where you go i will go your 
people will be my people and your god my god 
on naomis advice ruth worked in the harvest sleeping at the 
feet of the owner boaz thus winning him as her husband they were 
parents of obed father of jesse who fathered king david 
his philandering with bathsheba the gorgeous wife of an absent 
military officer uriah produced sons nathan and future king 
solomon alternatively listed in jesus line of descent 
other men on the lists also displayed foibles such as jacobs 
deceiving his father to gain an inheritance and even abraham 
fearfully palming off his lovely wife sarah as his sister to 
placate the ruling pharaoh while temporarily in egypt 
nevertheless those honored patriarchs also displayed courage 
initiative and devotion in their covenant with god to lead a people 
that would be a promised light to the nations 
the great israelite military commander joshua successor to 
moses also is listed along with a long succession of kings 
decent and debauched in addition to charming psalmsinging david 
and wise solomon credited with the book of proverbs and builder of 
jerusalems first temple 
other kings include rehoboam whose oppressions idolatrous 
rites and immoralities stirred a revolt that divided the kingdom 
uzziah stricken with leprosy in a prosperous reign and hezekiah 
who led reforms under guidance of the prophet micah 
also listed is manasseh described as the most wicked king of 
judah whose religious deviations included baalism exaltation of 
the idol astarte wizardry and molech worship that involved forcing 
children through fire 
tradition has it that manasseh had the great prophet isaiah 
sawed asunder 
one king listed josiah took the throne at age 8 when his 
father amon was murdered but josiah had a long just reign 
ousting corrupt priests and recovering the lost book of law in 
repairing the temple 
of many others named some are clouded uncertain figures while 
others are notable in jewish annals such as judah founder of a 
main israelite tribe and the prophet nathan who rebuked david for 
his illicit affair 
the mixed lot of people with their sundry faults and strengths 
were all part of the promise fulfilled by the christ child 
willimon writes they for all their weaknesses were 
instruments of the promise 
on the other hand jesus descent also is traced directly to the 
godhead adding an unfathomable engima to his humanity 
in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and 
the word was god says the distinctively interpretative gospel of 
john and the word became flesh and dwelt among us full of grace 
and truth 
he is fully god and fully man classic christian doctrine 
says his conception by the virgin mary is ascribed by the gospels 
to divine intervention st paul calls him the image of the 
invisible god 
jesus himself though he was generally elusive about it and 
though he identified closely with common folk sometimes laid it 
out plainly as related by johns gospel 
truly truly i say to you before abraham was i am he 
said i and the father are one the father is in me and i am 
in the father

a soldier who led a failed 
coup attempt in one of south africas nominally independent black 
homelands has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for high treason 
warrant officer timothy phiri was the last of 142 soldiers to be 
sentenced for their roles in a february 1988 coup attempt in 
bophuthatswana one of four tribal homelands designated independent 
by south africa but not recognized abroad 
the other defendants convicted last month of treason or 
terrorism were sentenced monday and tuesday to prison terms 
ranging from 2 to 10 years 
the coup was crushed by south african commandos who freed 
homeland president lucas mangope from captivity at a soccer stadium 
and arrested the rebels all members of the homeland army 
bophuthatswana supreme court justice mw friedman said phiri 
was a danger to society who had allowed mangope to be 
illtreated during the coup attempt and had ordered his rebels to 
fire on the homes of homeland cabinet ministers

robert robinson the alderman and lawyer 
assassinated by a mail bomb is being remembered as an easygoing 
generous man whose community affairs work made people believe 
they can make a difference 
robinson whom even new acquaintances called robbie died 
monday when a package containing an explosive and nails blew up at 
his law office 
robinson and mayor john rousakis had planned to attend a meeting 
that evening at the lawyers church to discuss how blacks could 
fight drugs in their neighborhoods robinson was black 
the 42yearold attorney was the second victim in a rash of mail 
bombs in the south a package bomb killed 11th us circuit court 
of appeals judge robert s vance on saturday a mail bomb found at 
the federal courthouse in atlanta was disarmed monday a parcel 
bomb mailed to the naacps jacksonville fla office was disarmed 
tuesday 
on tuesday savannahs legislative offices were closed in 
mourning 
rousakis said robinson was a warm kind person always with a 
smile on his face and a hand out to help 
he meant the future to savannah he gave to the community in 
such a selfless way that he made people just believe they can make 
a difference said alderman willie brown 
at a news conference city leaders said they believed robinsons 
involvement with the national association for the advancement of 
colored people which he represented in a school desegregation 
case was related to his death 
rousakis said robinson was an active member of his church and 
was worked to help the homeless 
friends said robinsons political activity was not the kind that 
would be expected to generate murderous enemies 
ive known him a very long time and he is not the kind of guy 
i would think would be a target of such an action said superior 
court judge eugene gadsden he was easygoing and went about his 
business 
longtime friend al rivers said robinson took part in civil 
rights protests until he went off to college then he came back 
got into politics and his time began to get tight 
rousakis said robinson had been a city councilman for eight 
years but had served on other government and community boards his 
entire adult life 
as city transit authority chairman 10 years ago robinson led a 
move to provide transportation for the poor and the elderly 
robinson one of the first black students to attend savannah 
high school in the 1960s represented the naacp in the longrunning 
savannah schools desegregation case 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals ruled in october that the 
citys magnetschool plan was appropriate for desegregation 
neither city nor school officials knew whether the naacp was 
planning to appeal and naccp head curtis cooper could not be 
reached for comment 
robinson is survived by his wife ann and three daughters 
alderman floyd adams jr said city officials would start a fund for 
robinsons family 
rousakis said a local business allamerican builders had 
already donated a 1000 reward for information in the case 
we are sure the savannah police department will not quit until 
they come to some conclusion alderman brown said meanwhile 
the fund gives people a way to prove their love for robbie

in contrast to the largely peaceful 
changes in other eastern european countries president nicolae 
ceausescu of romania appears determined to use force to defend his 
hardline regime 
ceausescu 71 the most senior soviet bloc leader after 24 years 
in power has said reformminded communists elsewhere have betrayed 
their people by refusing to defend marxist orthodoxy 
ceausescus refusal to embrace change has isolated him from all 
his warsaw pact allies some analysts say he is seeking stronger 
ties with rigid communist systems similarly opposed to political 
reform particularly north korea cuba and china 
his leadership is based on a family dynasty with some 40 
relatives reportedly placed in key state and party jobs his wife 
elena virtual secondincommand in romania is a politburo member 
and first vice premier 
one of ceausescus brothers ilie is an army general and deputy 
defense minister another brother nicolae andruta is a police 
general and deputy interior minister and another brother ion is 
in charge of economic planning 
his youngest son nicu 39 is a politburo candidate member and 
party chief of sibiu region in southern transylvania 
romania is a showcase for any repressive totalitarian state 
the harsher the repression the more violent the public upheaval it 
brings about and the greater the desire to take revenge on 
leaders ion ratiu chairman of the londonbased world union of 
free romanians said monday 
since he became party leader in 1965 ceausescu has exercised 
absolute power and carried out a foreign policy independent of the 
soviet union 
while that maverick stance won him praise and credits from the 
west ceausescu kept romanians under ironfisted control now with 
reform ascendent in the rest of the warsaw pact the harsh romanian 
stand draws condemnation from abroad 
about 30000 coal miners went on strike in the jiu valley in 
1977 and 10000 workers demonstrated in the city of brasov in 1987 
demanding freedom better living conditions and ceausescus ouster 
police arrested hundreds of demonstrators and their leaders 
disappeared 
an extensive secret police force keeps strict control on 
religious and political expression and dissent is quickly crushed 
making chances for peaceful change in romania seem remote 
but poverty and despair engendered by economic problems and 
political repressions could cause people to risk direct 
confrontations with armed forces as in timisoara now 
unlike recent protests in prague and east germany witnessed and 
reported by the western media demonstrations in romania have taken 
place well outside the public eye 
the western reporters permitted into the country in recent years 
have been kept under close watch and police have detained 
journalists and even diplomats attempting to visit the countrys 
few dissidents 
romania has closed its borders and barred most foreigners from 
entering the country in an apparent attempt to prevent the spread 
of news about the timisoara protest the largest demonstration 
against ceausescus policies since the brasov riots 
romania has little tradition of democratic rule after five 
centuries under the ottoman turks romania won independence in 
1877 becoming first a monarchy then during the second world war 
an ally of the nazis 
the last monarch king michael was forced to abdicate in 
december 1947 under threat of civil war and pressure from the 
kremlin and its romanian communist allies

place which has become more international

secretary of state james a baker iii says he 
regrets possibly misleading the american public about a secret trip 
to china taken by two highlevel bush administration officials 
baker said through a spokeswoman tuesday night he felt 
obligated to protect the secrecy of a mission the president wished 
to have classified 
speaking for baker spokeswoman margaret d tutwiler added he 
regrets that he may have misled some 
it was the first acknowledgement of error since the white house 
announced on dec 9 that national security adviser brent scowcroft 
and deputy secretary of state lawrence eagleburger were visiting 
beijing 
their trip was roundly condemned in congress as a friendly 
gesture to china and a cancellation of the ban president bush 
imposed on highlevel exchanges after prodemocracy students were 
massacred in early june in tiananmen square 
another sanction crumbled tuesday night when bush moved to end a 
ban that prevented the us exportimport bank from providing 
financial aid to companies doing business in china 
also the white house announced that bush had approved the 
export of three communications satellites expected to be launched 
by china saying the deal was in the national interest 
sen albert gore dtenn called bushs approval of the 
satellite export licenses a true outrage and another effort 
to curry favor with the hardliners in beijing and an insult to the 
memory of those who died for democracy in tiananmen square 
criticism also mounted on capitol hill against this months 
visit by scowcroft and eagleburger to beijing as well as an 
earlier one in july 
to have sent two of our highest level officials to beijing 
only weeks after announcing a ban on such exchanges makes the 
president look like a wimp in beijing and a hypocrite in 
washington said rep stephen solarz dny a leading 
congressional spokesman on asia issues 
in defense of bushs actions white house spokesman marlin 
fitzwater said it is not misleading to not tell you about 
everything hes doing the presidents up there in the oval office 
doing things all day long that you dont know and wont know about 
and thats not misleading 
baker appearing on abctv on dec 10 called the trip taken in 
early december to beijing by scowcroft and eagleburger the first 
time weve had highlevel us officials go to the peoples 
republic of china 
on monday however the white house disclosed scowcroft and 
eagleburger also had made a secret trip to china in july 
asked about the apparent discrepancy state department 
spokeswoman tutwiler said baker had explicitly acknowledged the 
december trip by scowcroft and eagleburger was not the first time 
we had highlevel contacts with china since the crackdown 
she noted that baker mentioned on abc his own meeting in august 
with chinese foreign minister qian qichen at a conference on 
cambodia in paris 
he specifically referred to his own contacts ms tutwiler 
said but he felt obligated to protect the secrecy of a mission 
that the president wished to have classified 
he regrets that he may have misled some but he felt that by 
acknowledging his own direct involvement it was sufficient to make 
the point that this was not the first case of highlevel contact 
gore sponsored the legislation that forbids the launch of 
usmanufacturered satellites on chinese rockets unless the 
president declares it to be in the us national interest as bush 
has done 
the hughes aircraft co is selling the satellites to firms in 
australia and hong kong for launching on a chinese rocket 
approval of these licences is in keeping with the presidents 
policy not to disrupt normal commercial relations with china a 
white house statement added 
these satellites are intended for civil use and represent 
significant investments for the firms based in australia and hong 
kong the statement said it is in the national interest of the 
united states to approve export licenses for the three satellites 
currently being prepared for launch in china 
the white house also cited national interest in waiving 
restrictions on the exportimport banks financing of us business 
activities within china 
the white house said the waiver preserves a level playing 
field for us business additional business activity with china 
will be considered on a casebycase basis as part of a continuing 
review process 
one of the few on capitol hill who has supported bushs 
overtures rep jim leach riowa said sending scowcroft and 
eagleburger to underscore human rights concerns was exactly in 
conformity with the congressional position which reflected the 
views of the american people 
but rep lee hamilton dind a senior member of the house 
foreign affairs committee said the administration did what it 
told us they were not doing 
surely the chinese would see it that way if we send the 
national security adviser to the president there is no sanction 
from the standpoint of china i dont buy that distinction at 
all hamilton said

bassam z shakhashiri is ushering in the 
christmas season with a bang 
several hundred children squealed with delight tuesday night 
when a loud boom and burst of flames from an exploding hydrogen 
balloon signaled the start of the lebaneseborn professors 20th 
annual christmas science show 
its called once upon a christmas cheery in the lab of 
shakhashiri and hes taking his popular chemistry lecture this 
season to madison wis washington and boston 
standing on the stage of the national academy of sciences 
auditorium shakhashiri doffed his tuxedo jacket black bow tie and 
ruffled shirt and set to work wearing a science is fun tshirt 
for the next hour he captivated his audience of more than 600 
kids and their parents with a demonstration of the beauty the 
magic and the adventure of science often using ordinary 
household chemicals found in vinegar laundry detergent and 
disposable diapers 
as shakhashiri performed his scientific sleight of hand bottles 
popped their corks a metal can collapsed a phony dollar bill 
vanished in a puff a dishpan overflowed with fog clear liquids 
turned into yuletide greens and reds or glowed in the dark and a 
gooey yellow stuff kept oozing out of its glass jar like a yogurt 
machine gone haywire 
while a visiting santa claus applauded from the front row 
shakhashiri delivered his showstopping finale shaking a flask 
containing silver nitrate ammonia sugar and other ingredients to 
produce a giant shiny christmas tree ornament then he made his 
pitch to the wideeyed youngsters 
have fun and work hard in school he said and think about a 
career in science or mathematics because our country needs you 
shakhashiri whose first name rhymes with shazam and means 
smiley in his native beirut emigrated to the united states 
with his parents in 1957 he is a chemistry professor at the 
university of wisconsin at madison on leave as assistant director 
of the national science foundation an independent federal agency 
that awards grants to colleges and public schools for scientific 
education and research 
it was at the wisconsin campus that shakhashiri delivered his 
first christmas lecture for kids of all ages in 1970 he 
borrowed the idea from michael faraday the great english chemist 
and physicist whose christmas science lectures for children were 
popular in the 1840s 
im trying to share the excitement and joy of doing handson 
science shakhashiri said in an interview i dont try to snow 
anybody with technical details my idea is to capture their 
interest and not allow them to extinguish their flame of 
curiosity 
shakhashiri is disturbed by a foundation estimate that the 
united states faces a cumulative shortfall of 450000 nativeborn 
college graduates with bachelors degrees in science math and 
engineering by the year 2000 and a projected shortage of 8000 
scientists with doctorates by 2004 
its very very alarming he says the nation desperately 
needs highly trained scientists to tackle such challenges as the 
superconducting super collider space stations human genetic 
mapping and the aids epidemic he says 
whats at stake is the preeminence of the united states in 
science and technology and the global economy and the quality of 
life not only in the united states but on earth shakhashiri said

the aflcio says it will host a nearly 
monthlong visit to the united states by 10 soviet miners seeking 
to form independent unions and promises to support the miners even 
if it has to defy the soviet government 
lane kirkland president of the 141 millionmember labor 
federation announced tuesday that the delegation would arrive in 
the united states on dec 29 for a nearly monthlong stay 
the visit will begin in new york and bring the miners to 
washington on jan 3 a more detailed itinerary was not available 
but the delegation plans to visit some us mines to study mining 
and safety practices kirkland said 
the miners will be the guests of the aflcio but their trip is 
being paid for by through a us information agency exchange 
program 
the aflcio has repeatedly refused torecognize visits by members 
of governmentsanctioned soviet unions arguing those are little 
more than puppet organizations 
the miners requested the aflcios support last month and 
kirkland likening their struggle to that of solidarity organizers 
in poland in the early 1980s promised american unions would 
deliver 
if necessary was kirklands response when asked if the 
aflcio would take the same steps it took to support solidarity 
which included the smuggling of printing and other communications 
equipment into poland during the period in which solidarity was 
outlawed in all the federation gave about 5 million worth of 
equipment and other assistance to solidarity 
although it refused to allow the federation delegation into the 
soviet union kirkland noted that the soviet government had allowed 
two trade union activists to attend the aflcios recent convention 
and had granted exit visas to the miners all members of strike 
committees which have been at loggerheads with the kremlin 
because of those steps kirkland said it was clear there is a 
measure of glasnost in kremlin policy toward independent union 
activity and said that made it unclear whether the soviet 
government would move to block aflcio support of the miners 
im interested in testing its limits kirkland said of the 
soviet government 
the soviet miners scheduled to visit were among the leaders of 
strikes by thousands of soviet miners beginning last summer soviet 
leader mikhail s gorbachev was critical of the strikers accusing 
them of undermining his efforts to revive the soviet economy

housing and urban development secretary jack 
kemp says he is moving quickly to correct problems that caused a 
congressional study to say hud has an extremely weak ethics 
review system 
kemps pledge came tuesday following the release of a general 
accounting office study that said hud was failing to make sure 
consultants filed financial disclosure forms and was not reviewing 
the ones filed by employees 
we found that huds system for obtaining and reviewing 
disclosure statements is extremely weak for its own employees as 
well as for experts and consultants gao said 
the fact that the problems we are reporting have existed for 
so long demonstrates to us that the hud secretary has not held the 
ethics officials sufficiently accountable for developing and 
administering an effective financial disclosure system 
gao said there have been three hud workers who have filled in as 
the agencys chief ethics officer since kemp took over early this 
year and said there has not been a staff and resource commitment 
to policing for conflicts of interest 
it appears that to a large extent it is business as usual at 
the department of housing and urban development said sen david 
pryor dark who requested and released the report i am 
faulting secretary kemp 
kemp through hud general counsel francis keating acknowledged 
the problems 
keating said kemp would hire a new chief ethics officer by 
years end and would soon fully staff an expanded ethics department 
a new ethics manual also will be published by the end of the 
year and all hud employees are being required to attend ethics 
seminars keating said 
there are still things that need to be done but they are being 
done keating said no one is having to make a convert at this 
department on the subject of ethics 
the gao said it reviewed the files of 62 consultants hired by 
hud from 1986 to 1989 and that 52 had not filed required financial 
disclosure forms 
the agency the investigative arm of congress also said that 
hud received 62 disclosure reports from employees who are required 
to file them but that the agency had not reviewed any of them more 
than 100 days later ethics law requires that the reports designed 
to uncover possible conflicts of interest be reviewed within60 
days 
keating said most have since been reviewed and the rest would be 
scrutinized by jan 15 
gao said the problems date back at least seven years and persist 
despite kemps promises to rid the agency of mismanagement 
political influence and other problems blamed for a number of 
agency scandals during the reagan administration 
it is the second time kemps administration has come under some 
criticism in a study of agency management the departments 
inspector general issued an earlier report praising kemps plans to 
reform the oversight of agents hud contracts to sell properties but 
said the departments regional offices were slow in implementing 
the changes

democrats are attacking sen phil gramm for 
handpicking candidates to challenge texas democratic congressmen 
next year but they say the senators record of choosing republican 
losers gives them little to worry about 
calling those who complain wacko gramm says the democrats 
are running scared because 1990 doesnt look like a good year for 
them 
gramm a firstterm republican is running for reelection next 
year and is not believed to be currently facing a serious 
challenge his only announced opponent is democratic state sen 
hugh parmer a former mayor of fort worth the filing deadline is 
jan 2 
while gramms people say the senator is concentrating on his own 
race howard schloss spokesman for the democratic congressional 
campaign committee claims gramm has handpicked challengers to 
reps jim chapman of sulphur springs greg laughlin of west 
columbia and bill sarpalius of amarillo 
hes going into the district handpicking the candidate 
forcing him down the throat of the local republican party then the 
candidate loses and everybody has hard feelings schloss says 
hes being a real lone ranger causing problems in his own 
party 
gramm intervened this summer in a special election to fill the 
fort worth seat vacated by former house speaker jim wright when he 
released a name recognition poll conducted by dr bob lanier 
signaling to local republicans they should rally behind the 
physician 
lanier lost a close race to democrat pete geren 
in 1985 gramm helped create a congressional opening by 
recommending democratic rep sam b hall jr for a federal 
judgeship gramm backed republican candidate edd hargett who lost 
the election despite outspending chapman 31 
gramm however says hes not handpicking candidates merely 
talking to people who are interested in running for office state 
gop chairman fred meyer and gary koops a spokesman for the 
national republican congressional committee agree and say the 
senator is a tireless worker for the party 
ive talked to 200 people about running for governor 
lieutenant governor attorney general congress state senate 
state representative county commission county sheriff people who 
are interested in running for office talk to me gramm said 
but several texas democrats say gramms intervention damages the 
congressional delegations bipartisan unity 
it creates schisms and divisions that we dont need as well 
as bitterness theres no way better way to alienate a person than 
to go out and solicit someone to run against him its one of the 
most personally offensive things anybody could possible do 
wright says i wish he would reconsider and consider the effect 
on the delegation 
countered gramm wright was elected running against a 
longtime entrenched incumbent did that tear up the delegation i 
think whats happening is that the democrats are getting scared 
with the delegations clout at low ebb from wrights resignation 
and other setbacks democratic rep john bryant says gramms 
interference is particularly unwelcome as texans fight to preserve 
federal funding for several state projects 
its very difficult to work with a guy who spends all of his 
time trying to create political problems for you bryant says 
he does it every two years the opponents he recruits always 
lose but it creates an enormous amount of illwill in the 
congressional delegation hes hard to work with anyway a 
shameless headline seeker and this just makes it worse

federal safety investigators are blaming the 
boat accident deaths of four people in oregon last year on the 
coast guards failure to require lifeboats and a signal beacon on 
the vessel that carried them 
the national transportation safety board has tried for years to 
get the coast guard to toughen requirements for an estimated 4700 
small commercial vessels that are equipped to carry 300000 
passengers 
there has been a long documented absence of regulatory 
action said board member jim burnett 
the ntsbs 30 decision tuesday was the first time it has said 
the services lack of regulations contributed to deaths in an ocean 
accident the sept 15 1988 incident off the coast of oregon 
involved the sinking of the cougar a 46foot vessel used to carry 
passengers on a fishing trip 
after the boat took on water and sank passengers and crew were 
left in the cold pacific ocean clinging to float devices and 
debris for 18 hours as searchers tried to locate them the 
captain a deckhand and two passengers died a ships mate and four 
other passengers survived 
the last victim drowned 15 minutes before a helicopter rescued 
the others about 35 miles out into the ocean west of depoe bay 
investigators said 
the board also blamed the coast guard for failing during 
inspections to confirm the watertightness of hatchcovers on boats 
deck 
its report said the probable cause of the accident was the 
captains failure to ensure that his hatchcovers were watertight 
that the bilge pump was operating properly and that rubber flaps 
designed to let water flow off the deck were correctly installed 
the captain was not identified in the report 
the flaps were on the wrong side preventing water from flowing 
off the deck investigators said the ship sank in moderately heavy 
seas while returning from a fishing trip after its crew and 
passengers tried for 90 minutes to remove water with buckets 
the board for years has recommended that the coast guard require 
all passenger boats to carry lifeboats that will keep all 
passengers and crew out of the water if the ship sinks and that 
emergency position indicating radio beacons or epribs be carried 
on all vessels so they can be quickly located by searchers 
in the last five years the board has investigated five 
passenger vessel accidents including two collisions one fire one 
capsizing and one grounding in each case coast guard survival 
craft requirements were found inadequate but there has been no 
change in the regulations 
the board recommended that the coast guard require that within 
five years all flotation devices and buoyant apparatus be replaced 
by lifeboats life rafts or inflatable devices that can keep people 
out of the water 
passengers using flotation devices remain in the water where 
they can suffer from a rapid loss of body heat or hypothermia 
the board also advised the coast guard to improve its testing 
rules and procedures and require all passenger vessel operators to 
file sailing plans before they set out

has a critical situation with the united states we think the 
level of aggression and intimidation will increase he told the 
associated press 
there are helicopters flying during the night over our 
installations he said 
at the state department in washington spokeswoman margaret 
tutwiler said noriegas declaration last week that a state of war 
existed with the united states followed by indiscriminate and 
unprovoked violence against americans clearly increases tensions 
in panma 
ms tutwiler would not say what contingencies or options were

social security commissioner gwendolyn king is 
supporting a plan under which the government early next year would 
mail monthly refunds to millions of elderly people overcharged for 
medicare premiums 
if the plan goes through social security beneficiaries who 
unavoidably will be overcharged by about 530 a month for their 
medicare coverage early in 1990 will be simultaneously issued 
monthly refund checks 
the overcharges are the result of congress late action in 
repealing medicares catastrophic healthcare program social 
security contends its computers cant be adjusted by january to 
halt withholding of the extra medicare premium for catastrophic 
coverage 
as a result nearly 27 million social security beneficiaries who 
have medicare premiums deducted directly from their benefit checks 
are expected to be overcharged from january through may 
social security commissioner gwendolyn king said tuesday a panel 
of experts convened by the agency to study the problem suggested 
issuing monthly or bimonthly refund checks to offset the 
overcharges or sending out lumpsum refunds late in the spring 
mrs king said the treasury department which actually issues 
social security checks reported that lumpsum refunds were the 
most feasible option and that monthly refund checks would be much 
worse than the other two scenarios 
however mrs king said treasury did not expressly rule out the 
possibility of mailing monthly refunds so she will send back a 
signal that that would be our preferred option she said she 
would ask treasury to advise her on whether it can provide monthly 
checks 
that option appears to be the best way to get money back 
as quickly as possible mrs king said in an interview my 
purpose has been to try to make the beneficiaries whole they 
should not have to pay for this problem the question is how can we 
get them this money 
andy montgomery a spokesman for treasurys bureau of financial 
management services said the agency has been meeting with social 
security to identify the most expeditious way to achieve the 
refunds at this particular point nothing has been decided 
social security initially had said it probably would issue the 
refunds in lump sums late in the spring mrs kings statement that 
she would push for monthly refunds came on the same day that two 
congressmen sent president bush a letter asking him to support that 
option 
reps david bonior dmich and robert wise dwva said 
retirees should not have to pay even temporarily for a program 
that wont exist next year 
for seniors this isnt just a matter of principle its a 
matter of meeting rent payments buying food and paying 
utilities bonior said 
bonior said the general accounting office estimated the cost of 
issuing monthly refunds at 25 million to 30 million and said the 
first refund checks could be in the mail by february 
mrs king said each extra monthly mailing would cost about 10 
million

many long distance telephone rates to points 
in the united states and abroad will be going down after the first 
of the year the three major long distance companies say 
american telephone and telegraph co filed reductions with the 
federal communications commission tuesday mci communications corp 
and us sprint said they will take action to remain competitive 
atampt says it has about 70 percent of the long distance market 
as measured by interstate and intrastate revenues mci is no 2 
with more than 10 percent us sprint claims 7 to 8 percent 
the atampt reductions will take effect jan 1 barring an unusual 
action by the fcc to block them 
the company said the reductions were taken in line with an fcc 
price cap which has been reduced because local telephone companies 
are charging long distance companies less for access to customers 
lines 
atampts submission to the fcc called for 300 million a year in 
reductions on interstate and international long distance services 
used primarily by residential and small business customers other 
categories of service used by businesses such as private lines and 
800 and 900 numbers are not affected 
mci spokesman john hauser said the no 2 long distance company 
also will reduce its rates to pass on the savings in local 
telephone company charges we will remain competitive with 
them he said i dont know how much our total cost savings 
will be 
hausers counterpart at us sprint robin pence said we are 
reviewing the filing and we intend to remain competitive 
the company said price reductions will apply to its reach out 
america and optional long distance plans as well as to basic long 
distance service 
a 10minute call during daytime hours on a weekday to anywhere 
in the united states will cost 250 or less a decrease of 13 
percent on the average the company said some of the increases 
would be greater for example a 10minute daytime call from 
washington to new york which now costs 230 would decline to 
220 daytime hours are 8 am to 5 pm local time monday through 
friday 
in the evening the rate for a call to anywhere in the united 
states will drop by an average of 2 percent the company said an 
evening call from washington to san francisco los angeles or 
dallas which now costs 167 for 10 minutes would be 158 the 
evening period is 5 pm to 11 pm sunday through friday 
weekend rates are in effect all day saturday and until 5 pm on 
sunday and the same rates apply from 11 pm to 8 am sunday 
through friday these rates will not change the maximum for such a 
call is 132 for 10 minutes within the united states the company 
said 
discounts for subscribers to the reach out america 24hour plan 
will be increased from 5 percent to 10 percent on weekday calls and 
from 20 to 25 percent on evening calls under reach out america 
the evening period is 5 pm to 10 pm sunday through friday 
international calls from the us mainland to 25 of the most 
frequently called countries and overseas areas will be slashed by 
104 million the reductions will vary from country to country and 
the countries will include canada mexico japan the united 
kingdom france italy israel brazil australia the philippines 
taiwan and korea 
a fiveminute call from anywhere in the united states to japan 
between 2 and 8 pm now 872 at the standard rate prevailing in 
those hours will drop to 807 a similar call to britain between 
1 and 6 pm when discount rates are in effect for such calls 
will decline from 421 to 399 calls to mexico will decline from 
2 to 20 percent depending on the time and the city from which the 
call is placed a fiveminute call from new york to cancun now 
790 at the standard rate will drop to 590 five minutes from 
los angeles to mexico city now 615 will cost 555 
atampt said the reduction will be the companys 10th since 1984 
and would bring total rate decreases to 40 percent in the six years 
since the breakup of the bell system

president bushs secret dealings with the 
repressive government in beijing suggest a double standard in the 
way the administration views china and the rest of the world in 
terms of human rights and aspirations for democracy 
with the soviet union for example the united states demands 
that human rights stand as a centerpiece of the superpower 
relationship 
yet with china bush is moving to resume business with its 
aging hardline leaders even though they remain doggedly 
unrepentant about the june massacre of prodemocracy demonstrators 
and continue to suppress their citizens 
on tuesday bush approved the export of three communications 
satellites expected to be launched by china and he moved to end a 
ban that kept the us exportimport bank from aiding companies 
doing business with china 
winston lord the us ambassador to china until last april 
says the united states would not have reversed course so swiftly if 
the killings had occurred in eastern europe 
breaking with the administration because of its secret 
diplomatic missions to beijing lord said the us overtures were a 
sign of cultural if not racial bias 
bush has been an outspoken champion of democratic reforms that 
are toppling hardline communist regimes from power in eastern 
europe 
along those lines the white house on tuesday denounced the 
systematic denial of human rights in romania and called on its 
government to cease the brutal repression that some witnesses 
say has left hundreds dead 
it is a message that could be aimed just as easily at china 
however bush has muted his criticism of beijing and he only 
reluctantly accepted sanctions imposed by congress against china 
an old china hand bush has taken the position he knows better 
than his critics its hard to judge exactly what bush is doing 
since he refuses to talk about it publicly 
you see bush explained to reporters i still believe that 
sometimes to effect change you talk in confidence to people 
he insists his secret dealings do not amount to condoning the 
repression in china that is not a good rap and it is not true 
bush said 
as for the secrecy of bushs actions white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater says the presidents conduct of foreign 
relations will from time to time involve him in making trips 
making contacts talking to people and keeping it secret 
the administrations actions have sharpened tensions between the 
white house and congress on foreign policy and are sure to be an 
issue of contention when lawmakers return to washington 
there probably will be congressional hearings on us policy 
toward china 
the flash point of dispute is the two secret missions to china 
by presidential emissaries brent scowcroft bushs national 
security adviser and lawrence eagleburger his deputy secretary of 
state 
reluctantly the white house revealed that scowcroft and 
eagleburger had traveled to beijing barely a month after the 
crackdown the purpose fitzwater said was to tell chinese leaders 
face to face that the united states found their conduct 
unacceptable 
the news provided fresh ammunition for opponents of bushs 
policies 
to have sent two of our highest level officials to beijing 
only weeks after announcing a ban on such exchanges makes the 
president look like a wimp in beijing and a hypocrite in 
washington said rep stephen solarz dny 
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine demanded that 
the administration make a full disclosure of its contact with china 
even before disclosure of the july trip democrats were up in 
arms about an announced visit by scowcroft and eagleburger to china 
in december 
toasting chinese leaders with words approved by bush scowcroft 
said the united states wanted to bring new impetus and vigor to 
the relationship 
in language soothing to the chinese government scowcroft said 
in both our societies there are voices of those who seek to 
redirect or frustrate our cooperation we both must take bold 
measures to overcome these negative forces 
fitzwater asked to identify the negative forces in the united 
states said tuesday i dont know he suggested that the 
question should be directed to scowcroft

restrictions on oliver l norths testimony 
will make it more difficult to prosecute john poindexter says a 
former chief counsel to the congressional irancontra committees 
us district court judge harold greene ruled tuesday that 
norths statements at his own trial are offlimits for use in the 
poindexter case 
north testified in april that he saw the former national 
security adviser tear up a presidential finding retroactively 
legalizing cia assistance for a november 1985 shipment of hawk 
missiles to iran 
but north testified last week that his recollection on that and 
other matters was influenced by poindexters immunized appearance 
on capitol hill in 1987 therefore said greene norths trial 
testimony as it relates to poindexter may not be used unless it 
was a subject which poindexter didnt address in his immunized 
testimony 
the courts obligations require it to err on the side of 
protecting poindexters constitutional right not to be convicted 
with the use of his own testimony said the judge 
prosecutors may only elicit evidence from north based on his 
statements prior to july 15 1987 the day poindexter began 
testifying on capitol hill said the judge 
by saying he was tainted north has snaked his way around 
the issue of having to testify about the finding being torn up 
said john nields former chief counsel to the house majority staff 
in the congressional irancontra hearings 
since north did not tell the congressional committees in 1987 
that he saw poindexter destroy the finding he wont be able to 
testify to it at the poindexter trial and i dont think the 
government has any other proof of it said nields 
the government still could elicit information about the 
findings being torn up if poindexter decides to testify in his own 
behalf at his trial which is scheduled to begin jan 22 
the destruction of the finding relates to four of the criminal 
charges against the former national security adviser he is accused 
of conspiracy two counts of obstructing congress and two counts of 
making false statements 
poindexter destroyed the december 1985 finding on nov 21 1986 
the same day he allegedly told congress that no one in the us 
government knew until early 1986 that the shipment had carried hawk 
missiles 
the prosecution says the finding which poindexter destroyed is 
the most critical document in proving the falsity of another 
document a chronology which is an essential part of the 
governments case against poindexter the chronology contains the 
same false information which poindexter allegedly gave to congress 
that no one in the government knew about the hawk shipment until 
1986 
paul thompson the national security councils legal counsel 
was present when poindexter tore up the finding 
but thompson said in a deposition to congress in august 1987 
that he didnt realize at the time it was the finding that 
poindexter was destroying 
one document we came to he ripped up saying this is no 
longer necessary or this has no future thompson recalled in 
his deposition to congress that document turns out to have been 
the finding thompson said he learned it was the finding when he 
saw poindexter admit it on television in his immunized testimony 
north was convicted in may of three felonies in the irancontra 
affair he is appealing the convictions on charges of altering and 
destroying documents accepting an illegal gratuity and aiding and 
abetting an obstruction of congress 
the obstruction charge was related to a november 1985 shipment 
of hawks to iran which also forms the basis of some of the charges 
in the poindexter case

socialist luis inacio lula da silva 
conceded defeat in the presidential election but he accused 
conservative victor fernando collor de mello of deception and 
pledged to build an opposition shadow government 
election officials announced tuesday that collor de mello a 
champion of freemarket policies had won sundays balloting 
fernando collor de mello is the winner and that must be 
respected but brazil was the big loser in the election gained 
through lies and falsehoods da silva told a news conference in 
sao paulo 
he will govern in favor of big business the armed forces and 
the international monetary fund de silva said the workers 
party and its allies will form a shadow government to prevent 
collor de mello from committing abuses 
with 967 percent of the ballots tallied collor de mello of the 
national reconstruction party had 33898190 votes or 427 
percent compared with 30546337 or 385 percent for da silva of 
the workers party the rest of the votes were abstentions or 
nullified ballots 
jose francisco rezek president of the superior electoral court 
that was supervising the tally said collor de mello would be 
declared the winner wednesday but an official announcement would 
only be made dec 29 
the election was the first direct vote for president in 29 
years current president jose sarney was selected in an electoral 
college vote strongly influenced by the rightwing military 
government that ran the country between 1964 and 1985 
collor de mello has been secluded in his brasilia mansion aides 
say he will only address the nation after election officials 
proclaim him the winner 
tv globo the nations largest television network ran a 
previously taped interview with the presidentelect tuesday night 
in which collor de mello promised a government with dignity 
austerity and character 
the new presidents first challenge will be harnassing inflation 
racing at over 1500 percent this year amid growing poverty 
collor de mellos campaign advisers have told the press he will 
seek to heal the wounds from the electoral campaign and call for a 
government of national unity 
however the wounds run deep 
in the campaigns final week collor de mellos campaign made 
vicious personal attacks on da silva and said his party wanted to 
impose a communist dictatorship in brazil 
i would never sit at the same table with collor de mello the 
low blows he used caused me to lose all respect for him da silva 
said at the tuesday press conference 
he said collor de mello scheduled to take office on march 15 
will face strong opposition from labor unions and six leftist 
parties 
during the electoral campaign collor de mello promised to end 
inflation privatize staterun firms reduce the size of 
government and sell cabinet ministers mansions to reduce the 
public deficit 
he also won the vote of a great part of the uneducated rural 
poor by pledging to increase spending for housing education and 
health care 
to realize these promises collor de mello must seek allies in 
the countrys national congress the new presidents party has 24 
senators and representatives only 3 percent of those in congress 
da silva said his party would back collor de mello if he 
sincerely attempted to carry out social reforms in this polarized 
society where the richest 1 percent receives almost half the 
national income 
but im afraid his call for national unity is nothing more 
than a trick to keep the working class quiet he said

three days of hearings on president bushs 
nominee to head nuclear weapons production have sharply divided the 
senate panel weighing the nomination but yielded few signs of 
whether hell be confirmed 
victor stello jr nominated as assistant energy secretary for 
defense programs last july 24 urged the senate armed services 
committee on tuesday to act as soon as possible but the panel is 
not expected to vote until january or february 
stello appeared before the committee in a first round of 
hearings nov 15 and 16 
three of the 11 democratic members of the committee sens john 
glenn of ohio edward kennedy of massachusetts and timothy wirth of 
colorado are strongly opposed to stello but most of their 
colleagues have not publicly taken a position 
among the nine republican members sen john mccain of arizona 
and others have charged that the democrats are trying to kill the 
nomination by stalling and raising what they say are irrelevant and 
unsubstantiated charges about stellos professional background 
stello worked for the nuclear regulatory commission and its 
predecessor the atomic energy commission for 26 years before 
going to the energy department last summer as a special adviser on 
the savannah river nuclear weapons plant 
in a separate development tuesday the energy department 
released a report showing that the new operator at savannah river 
the westinghouse savannah river co was given 39 million in 
federal award fees this year despite serious safety lapses 
including two instances of reactor workers sleeping on the job 
westinghouse was applauded for making some important 
improvements at the plant since it took over last april but the 
department cited numerous anomalies including cases of 
radiation alarms being deliberately disabled by workers 
stello in a final statement to the armed services committee 
said it is our country that is suffering because of a 
leadership vacuum in the weapons program he described the weapons 
production complex as being in a state of disarray 
sen strom thurmound rsc said stello is well suited for the 
job and that the real issue is whether opponents of nuclear 
weapons will allow confirmation of a man capable of rebuilding the 
production complex key production plants are shut down for safety 
upgrades and many private groups contend the facilities no longer 
are needed for national security 
wirth however said stello should be rejected because his 
record as a staff member of the nuclear regulatory commission was 
spotted with evidence that he sometimes put nuclear industry 
interests ahead of assuring public safety 
the department has been without a confirmed head of weapons 
production for more than a year 
of five former members of the nuclear regulatory commission wo 
testified tuesday three strongly endorsed stellos nomination and 
two raised serious doubts about his suitability 
joseph hendrie a former chairman of the nrc and currently a 
consultant to nuclear utilities said he has known stello for 17 
years and considers him a good manager and a natural leader i 
recommend him to you in the strongest terms 
james asselstine a commission member from 198287 said he has 
very mixed feelings about stello he called stello technically 
qualified for the energy department job but said stello at the nrc 
sometimes was too easy on those he regulated 
asselstine cited as an example a case in which stello ordered 
his staff to rewrite proposed changes in fire protection standards 
for nuclear plants to satisfy objections from utilities stello 
later denied this allegation

steam locomotives built in the philadelphia 
area were exported to railroads around the world years ago now 
two companies are importing from china 83ton locomotives based on 
a 1918 american design 
two brandnew steam engines were unloaded from a freighter 
sunday at the beckett street terminal in camden nj for the knox 
amp kane railroad in northwestern pennsylvania and the valley 
railroad in essex conn 
new steam locomotives havent been seen in this port since the 
1950s when the old baldwin locomotive works went out of business 
its been decades since efficient diesel locomotives made steam 
power obsolete on us railroads but steam engines have survived 
on short lines hauling tourists 
thousands of people visiting scenic and historic sites line up 
each year to ride on oldtime trains but even something as 
heavyduty as a locomotive eventually wears out 
the repairs we found necessary on our existing locomotives got 
the railroads thinking about new locomotives said j david 
conrad of the valley railroad as he waited for the new steam 
engine at the marine terminal 
the last place in the world that still makes steam engines is 
the tangshan locomotive amp rolling stock works about 140 miles east 
of beijing the chinese still rely on steam locomotives because of 
their sturdiness and because china has plenty of manpower and coal 
required by the old locomotives 
conrad went to the chinese in 1986 to arrange a sale and soon 
afterward the knox amp kane followed suit 
sloan cornell the knox amp kane general manager said the new 
engine would haul tourists through part of the allegheny national 
forest 
the main attraction of the knox amp kane is the 300foothigh 
2053footlong kinzua bridge the highest in the world when it was 
built about 17000 people rode the knox amp kane in 1988 
the valley railroad carries about 130000 passengers a year on 
its sixmile trip along the west shore of the connecticut river 
from essex to chester conn 
valley railroad president lynn parrott said the 300000 price 
for the new locomotive was worth it 
a delegation from valley visited three locomotive factories in 
china and decided on the class sy from tangshan sy stands for 
shang you chinese characters meaning aiming high according to 
valley 
similar engines built in the united states for export to japan 
early this century were nicknamed mikados 
conrad said valley preferred the smaller model over a larger 
locomotive from a plant in datong he and his assistants also 
preferred tangshans construction methods and the willingness of 
the tangshan engineering staff to american boiler codes and 
railroad guidelines 
when the new chinese locomotive finally arrives in connecticut 
ms parrott said it will be their primary engine she doubted that 
passengers would mind the locomotive was not an antique 
the majority of people who come here just like to ride behind 
a steam engine she said besides the engine being new and 
coming from china may arouse some curiosity 
after clearing customs the locomotives are to be towed or 
hauled on flatcars by conrail to their new owners

responding to congressional unrest over us 
policy toward el salvador bush administration officials say 
american aid to that country is yielding substantial benefits in 
battlefield performance and in protection of human rights 
a senior administration official who briefed reporters on 
tuesday said leftist rebels were sadly mistaken when they 
assumed that the uprising they launched six weeks ago would produce 
a popular uprising 
in addition the official said the armed forces are showing an 
increasing sensitivity to human rights concerns and contrary to 
popular wisdom there has not been a resurgence of rightist death 
squad activity 
but sen edward m kennedy expressing skepticism about the 
wisdom of us policy asked the general accounting office on 
tuesday to determine if us military aid has been used effectively 
in el salvadors long battle against the rebels 
kennedy dmass said the results of the gao investigation will 
form the background of a congressional review early next year of 
us policy toward el salvador 
the effectiveness of the large and continuing us aid program 
is called into question by the strong rebel offensive mounted 
against salvadoran government forces last month kennedy said 
the united states has provided el salvador with well over 3 
billion in economic and military aid over the past decade 
kennedy said he also wants to know if us military personnel 
inside el salvador have any knowledge of the activities of 
rightwing death squads and whether they are required to disclose 
such information 
a report issued over the weekend by americas watch a new 
yorkbased human rights organization said rights violations in el 
salvador have been occurring at a breathtaking pace since the 
rebel offensive began the report documents abuses by both 
government and rebel forces 
the us official who briefed reporters on the condition that 
he not be identified said the number of unexplained deaths after 
a dramatic decline in the early 1980s is still marginally 
down despite occasional blips 
he said there is no hard evidence of a resurgence of death squad 
activities either as the result of the victory by the rightist 
party last march or of the offensive begun last month by the fmln 
rebels 
the offensive is falling apart the official said asserting 
that the rebels now are facing food and medicine shortages 
he estimated that perhaps half of the rebel force of about 8000 
has been lost as a result of death wounding capture or desertions 
the official said there is no conclusive evidence implicating 
either the military or leftist forces in the unsolved murder of six 
jesuit priests in el salvador last month 
but rep joe moakley dmass a member of a special house panel 
investigating the murders said tuesday there is circumstantial 
evidence to implicate the salvadoran military 
moakley said this is the case despite the fact that during a 
week of questioning by the fbi a salvadoran woman mrs lucia 
barrera de cerna withdrew her story that the night of the murders 
she saw armed men in military uniform near the priests residence 
heard their voices and heard heavy gunfire 
this change in the womans testimony did not justify claims by 
salvadoran officials that mrs barreras testimony has been 
discredited thus proving that salvadoran armed forces were not 
involved in the murders moakley said 
there is other circumstantial evidence to implicate the 
military moakley said 
he said mrs barrera repeated her original story to members of 
the special committee declaring she had felt pressured to say 
she had actually seen nothing that night after her fbi 
interrogators made it evident they did not believe her 
she did change her story at that time but told us that she did 
so only to end the questioning of her moakley said 
the state department has denied absolutely and unequivocally 
allegations that she was mistreated during her interrogation

defense planners are suggesting a possible

proposed drastic cuts in us troop strength in the pacific the 
washington post reported today 
the options for troop cuts were presented to defense secretary 
dick cheney and gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of 
staff in a meeting monday at the pentagon the post reported 
citing unidentified sources 
no decisions have been made on the proposals the newspaper said 
maj david super a spokesman for the pentagon said he knew 
nothing about the meeting reported by the newspaper 
overall in the pacific the maximum amount of cuts contemplated 
in the pentagon briefing paper given to cheney would mean a 
reduction of 80000 people from the army and air force by the end 
of the 1994 fiscal year for a savings of 36 billion the 
newspaper reported 
currently the army has 32052 people stationed in south korea

the us government is being paid 327 
million by 99 japanese companies to settle bidrigging charges that 
officials say raised construction costs of a us navy base by 25 
percent 
the cartel of 140 companies had bid on construction of the base 
at yokosuka the justice department said tuesday 
japans fair trade commission which administers that countrys 
antitrust laws earlier had fined 69 companies 15 percent of the 
value of each companys contract for a total of 22 million and 
had warned 70 unsuccessful bidders not to continue in the 
bidrigging arrangement 
some companies offered to negotiate a settlement as a result of 
threats of a us government lawsuit in the japanese courts and 
also in the us courts against 26 companies also doing business in 
the united states the department said the settlement which 
involved 99 firms was negotiated in november the agency said 
japanese construction companies frequently collaborate on bids 
in a system called dango where the bidders decide who gets the 
winning bid the 140 companies bidding for us navy contracts at 
yokosuka formed an association in 1984 that called itself 
seiyukai or friends of the stars a reference to the 
american flag 
the association dissolved in 1987 when the companies became 
aware that they were under investigation by the navy 
stuart m gerson assistant attorney general in charge of the 
civil division of the department said the us government would 
pursue available remedies including possible lawsuits in 
japan the united states or both countries against construction 
companies that did not join the settlement 
we are pleased to have been able to reach a just result 
through the japanese legal process gerson said

the unrest in romania may be the beginning of 
the end for strongman nicolae ceausescu who was hailed 24 years 
ago as a soviet bloc maverick but is increasingly denounced for his 
repressive policies 
we are definitely in the twilight of the ceausescu era said 
f stephen larabee vice president of the institute for eastwest 
security studies in new york 
the soviet foreign minister and the white house both condemned 
ceausescus use of violence to crush demonstrations in the romanian 
city of timisoara where according to some reports as many as 400 
people died 
but ceausescu who has ruled romania with an iron hand since 
1965 is going to be a harder nut to crack than communist 
leaders swept from power in the soviet bloc nations of poland east 
germany hungary czechoslovakia and bulgaria said james brown a 
specialist in east european affairs at the rand corp in los 
angeles 
romania has been a maverick in the soviet camp for decades 
boycotting warsaw pact exercises trading with the west against 
kremlin wishes and most recently balking at the democratic reforms 
of mikhail s gorbachev 
although ceausescu may be able to survive in the short term his 
days seem numbered said larabee brown and other analysts 
this incident or some other might open up an explosion of 
popular dissent or some group in the leadership such as the 
military may decide to get rid of him sometime or another 
something has to give said raymond garthoff a former us 
ambassador to bulgaria and now a senior scholar at the brookings 
institution in washington 
the current unrest in romania began as a reaction to repressions 
against the hungarian minority in the nearby cities of timisoara 
and arad along with the more distant city of brasov but reports 
indicate that ethnic romanians may have joined the demonstrations 
experts say that is bad news for ceausescu 
ceausescu was once a favorite of us leaders because he refused 
to allow romanian troops to join warsaw pact military maneuvers 
was the only soviet bloc leader to maintain full relations with 
israel and traded with western nations against the wishes of 
moscow in 1969 thenpresident richard nixon went to romania in 
the first us state visit to a soviet bloc nation 
ceausesus widely reported human rights abuses chilled 
usromanian relations however and the united states last year 
withdrew trade favors from romania costing that nation as much as 
250 million annually 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater harshly criticized 
romania on tuesday 
the united states condemns the brutal use of police force by 
the romanian government against protesters in timisoara and other 
cities fitzwater told reporters 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze said that if the 
reports of bloodshed were true i can only express my very 
profound regret we are categorically opposed to the use of force 
romania has been a maverick since the late 1950s when 
ceausescus predecessor rejected a kremlin plan to more closely 
integrate the romanian economy into soviet bloc by selling moscow 
and its allies oil and other natural resources instead the 
romanians sold their oil to the west and used the money to 
industrialize 
ceausescu became party leader in 1965 and refused to allow 
romanian forces to take part in warsaw pact exercises 
he was the only warsaw pact leader to refuse to take part in the 
1968 sovietled invasion of czechoslovakia he denounced the soviet 
invasion of afghanistan in 1979 and refused to join the soviet bloc 
boycott of the 1984 olympic games in los angeles 
throughout that period the romanians took advantage of the 
sinosoviet dispute playing moscow off against beijing as reforms 
have swept eastern europe ceausescu has kept close ties with 
conservatives in beijing and counts as his closest allies hardline 
communist leaders in china north korea and cuba brown said

gen manuel antonio noriega who once called 
his opponents bullets kisses has been a shrewd and ruthless 
survivor who reveled in power and in thumbing his nose at what he 
called the colossus of the north 
at about midnight tuesday us forces bent on toppling the 
military strongman engaged panamanian troops less than a week after 
his rubberstamp assembly named him head of state and declared a 
state of war with the united states 
noriega had eliminated political opposition nullified the may 7 
elections when they were going against him and repeatedly defied 
the united states which indicted him on drug trafficking charges 
in february 1988 
it had long been known that tony noriega enjoyed a crisis 
and it was widely said that he would prefer death to losing power 
noriega who comes from el chorrillo the panama city district 
where defense forces headquarters is located has survived and 
created a mystique that won him the nickname the man the 
english word his initials spell 
noriega wrapped himself in nationalism saying it was part of 
the historic mission of his generation to take control of the 
panama canal under an accord with the united states panama is to 
take over the canal by the year 2000 
noriega claimed his enemies were plotting to abrogate the canal 
pact 
on oct 3 elements of the 15000man defense forces he 
commanded rebelled and claimed they had deposed him but troops 
loyal to him suppressed the rebellion and he personally accepted 
the rebels surrender 
during his last crisis in may after the opposition swamped his 
candidate the annulled presidential elections noriega was seen 
standing alone before the tomb of his patron gen omar torrijos 
the epitaph on the tomb is i dont want to enter heaven i 
just want to enter the canal zone 
torrijos who seized power in a 1968 signed the 1977 accord 
with former president carter to turn over the canal torrijos died 
in a plane crash in 1981 and noriega became commander of the 
defense forces in 1983 giving him de facto control of the 
government 
noriega was raised by foster parents and joined the defense 
forces in 1962 his ascent began when he caught the attention of 
torrijos then an ambitious young officer 
in his climb to the top he dealt with everyone from the cia to 
colombian cocaine cartels 
less than a year after torrijos took power in 1968 coup he made 
noriega then an obscure major chief of intelligence with the rank 
of lieutenant colonel 
it was like having the keys to the city noriega immediately 
began compiling dossiers on everyone who counted in panama the job 
also gave him close contact with us intelligence agencies and he 
formed powerful alliances 
one us official who dealt with noriega at the time on drug 
enforcement efforts said noriega was polite but when it came to 
something he wanted he was the coldest man i ever met 
after noriega became the defense forces commander he acquired a 
fleet of expensive cars and a home in an exclusive neighborhood 
his financial interests reportedly included a vast array of 
businesses including hotels casinos a television station radio 
stations maritime services dutyfree liquor stores and 
prostitution 
rumors about his personal life were plentiful but there were 
few facts even his age was disputed the general has said he is 
51 but the date in his high school yearbook would make him 54 
he is married and has a daughter who lives in the dominican 
republic 
although his private life is that of a rich man he worked hard 
to develop a populist image modeled on the revered torrijos 
spending weekends meeting with residents of towns and villages in 
this nation of 22 million 
noriega often speaks of his humble origins and characterizes his 
domestic opponents as rich and white the humble the poor and 
the blacks they are the utmost authority of the people he once 
said 
as the standoff with the united states dragged on noriega 
enjoyed underlining what he termed washingtons helplessness 
despite the 12000 troops it has stationed in panama 
noriega exercised power with ruthless assurance he closed 
newspapers for months at a time and presidents served at his 
pleasure 
rumors of opposition inside the defense forces were met with 
purges and reorganizations kisses was how he described the 
bullets fired in an attempted coup in march 1988 
the united states long his ally began to distance itself after 
the headless body of one of his opponents hugo spadadora was 
found in a us mailbag in costa rica in 1985 
a full break came in february 1988 when two federal grand 
juries in florida indicted noriega on drugtrafficking and 
moneylaundering charges 
the domestic opposition began to intensify its campaign against 
noriega and washington imposed crippling economic sanctions 
noriega didnt budge 
noriega through his control of the defense forces was named 
chief of government on dec 15 by a rubberstamp assembly it said 
his leadership was needed to confront a state of war caused by 
us economic sanctions and other efforts to oust the general 
he claims washington wants to oust him to make it easier for the 
united states to renege on the panama canal treaties 
shortly after the indictments in floria noriega delivered a 
speech he brandished a machete above his head then brought it 
crashing down on the podium 
not one step back he shouted

the national highway traffic safety 
administration says its upgrading an investigation of a possible 
steering deficiency in the 1988 chevrolet beretta

explosions in the heating systems of coachmen industries 
recreational vehicles and of cruise control failures in the ford 
taurus and mercury sable 
the agency said it was stepping up its beretta probe from a 
preliminary evaluation which involves mostly paperwork to an 
engineering analysis in which the possibly defective parts are 
examined 
such investigations can lead to recalls or can be dismissed if 
engineers decide there is no widespread safety problem

q has noriega been captured yet 
a this operation began at 1 oclock the situation on the 
ground is such that we are not at liberty a this point to comment 
on the military undertaking 
the operation is ongoing we dont know how long it will take 
but that is our ultimate objective it has not happened at this 
time 
q on what legal basis was this operation undertaken 
a the legal basis was first of all the presidents 
responsibility and duty to protect the lives of american citizens 
we have laid out in the past the number of threats to american 
citizens and to us servicemen there have been literally hundreds 
of cases of harassment of abuse and of situations that have caused 
us to believe very greatly that there is a threat to american 
citizens there is a threat to our rights under the canal treaty 
and the president has acted on that basis 
q was the president acting under intelligence reports that this 
operation has a guarantee or a certainty of success 
a the certainty of an undertaking like this is something that 
we obviously have confidence in we would not undertake a military 
action that we did not believe was well planned and had a high 
degree and high chance of success 
q is this being done in conjunction with any of the panamanian 
defense forces are any of the noriega forces joining in the us 
effort to oust noriega 
a as i indicated this operation began just less than a half an 
hour ago there are no indications of those kinds of changes in the 
conflict that i can report at this time 
q was there any planning in conjunction with the panamanian 
defense forces or is this solely a us operation 
a i cant comment on those kind of planning operations 
q the organization of american states is urging the president 
not to do this he has gone ahead and done it have you talked to 
the oasorganization of american states have you had any change 
of heart from the oas any indications of how theyre going to feel 
about this 
a the oas as you will recall considered this matter 
considerably following the may elections in panama those 
elections as you also know were thwarted by gen noriega all of 
america saw the bloody shirt and body of billy ford and the others 
who were beaten by gen noriega in the aftermath of that election 
and the oas was very forceful in their consideration of this issue 
and they sent a mission to panama to try to urge the termination of 
the noriega regime and they passed a resolution urging that it be 
ended by sept 1 this evening president bush vice president 
quayle and secretary of state baker are calling various leaders of 
latin american countries members of the oas as well as allied 
leaders and others we believe we do have support of the oas and 
the latin american countries

q is the fact that a step toward handing over the canal to the 
panamanians is scheduled to occur on jan 1 have anything to do 
with the timing of this operation now 
a i dont think is has to do with the timing but it certainly 
has to do with the substance we do have a responsibilty under the 
panama canal treaty for its safety and security and we do believe 
there have been threats that jeopardize the security of the treaty 
and that is one of the aspects of our purpose here 
q can you give us any details of a how its going b what the 
size of the us force that was amassed for this was and how long 
you think this operation might take 
a i really cant answer any of those questions in any great 
detail the united states is committing forces we believe are 
adequate to the task it is a major undertaking there are numbers 
of troops and equipment that have been dedicated to this task but 
i just want to wait until some later point to give any kind of 
logistical characterization of the size 
the president has been considering this matter for several days 
as you all know he was quite disturbed by the events of last 
weekend involving the killing of the united states marine and the 
harassment and threats to the naval officer and his wife the 
president reviewed this issue with his national security adivsers 
on sunday afternoon they considered options developed a plan and 
the president made the basic decision to proceed with this action 
since then there have been any number of meetings i will not go 
into details of when and how they were conducted but the president 
has been reviewing this matter on a continual basis since sunday 
and there really has not been any question about our willingness or 
our readiness to proceed since that time 
q what are the troops orders with regard to noriega were they 
ordered to try to take him alive and if they do what do you want 
them to do with him 
a their orders are to apprhenend gen noriega and our purpose 
is to return him to the united states for prosecution under our 
laws regarding drug trafficking gen noriega was indicted in the 
southern district of florida in miami and the northern district in 
tampa for drug trafficking and we want to bring him to the united 
states for prosecution under that indictment 
q who swore in endara under what legal authority and where is 
he now 
a i dont know who swore him in the legal authority of course 
was that they are the freely and openly elected leaders in the may 
elections and they are assuming office on that basis

q where are they now 
a i dont have their exact location 
q since this is a declaration of war why didnt the president 
come out and announce it himself 
a the declaration of war was set by panama not by the united 
states so dont get that confused the president is acting here to 
safeguard american lives to protect the panama canal treaty to 
secure the person who is under indictment for drug trafficking but 
the only declaration of war has been on the side of the panamanians 
q casualties 
a i have no information 
q whats the legal basis here in terms of a declaration of war 
and how had congress been informed 
a we are basing this on the actions outlined in this statement 
which is a pattern of agression in recent days which we think is 
quite threatening to american citizens in panama there are some 
35000 americans there as i recall roughly 35000 americans in 
panama in a pattern of harassment and threats going back almost a 
year that involves literally hundreds of cases ill try to provide 
you some details on that later and on the presidents strong 
feeling that we need to uphold the indictment and to move in this 
fashion 
q how has congress been informed 
a the president has telephoned earlier this evening the 
leadership of the congress michel foley mitchell dole other 
members of the armed services committee foreign affairs committee 
intelligence committees are being called this evening and they are 
all receiving briefings and information on the actions being taken 
q what is their reaction 
a their initial reaction has been supportive the president has 
talked to them briefly but did outline our purposes in much the 
same words that i have used here and we have only heard support 
q any final ultimatum directly or indirectly to noriega in 
the last few hours 
a our ultimatum is as stated that we are there to apprehend 
him and bring him back to america for prosecution 
q any attempt to communicate with him or warn him whats going 
to happen if you dont quit 
a no 
q where is the president monitoring the events and who is with 
him now 
q the president is in the oval office and also in his study 
which is right off the oval office governor sununu has been with 
him much of the evening general scowcroft has been there much of 
the evening secretary baker was there for a short time robert 
gates the deputy national security adviser has convened the 
deputies group he did that earlier this evening they are meeting

q do we know the whereabouts now of noriega and are us forces 
under strict orders not to shoot him or to injure him in any way 
a i just cant comment on the location of general noriega or 
what we do know about him that would jeopardize the mission i 
just could not offer any comment 
q what about the question of whether there are strict orders 
not to shoot him or injure him to make sure that he is apprehended 
alive 
a the orders are to apprehend general noriega i would not go 
beyond that 
q is president endara in this country or in panama 
a hes in panama 
q while the panamanian defense forces perhaps may not measure 
up to us forces nevertheless theyre 6500strong theyre not 
necessarily a pushover by any means yet you said tonight that 
there was pretty much assurance on the part of the administration 
that this mission would be successful that indicates that there 
may have been some communications with pdf forces to either 
participate or perhaps not resist was there any kind of 
communication with pdf forces beforehand 
a i did not use the word assurance i said that we would 
not undertake such a mission if we did not feel confident that we 
could carry it out successfully im not aware of any 
communications directly with the pdf 
q you said the us forces will be withdrawn as quickly as 
possible they will not be withdrawn until we have captured noriega 
a we are not willing to specify how long or in what 
circumstances they would be remain there 
q whos got operational control 
a operational control is in the pentagon 
let me just do one last thing on briefings that i would expect 
the next detailed briefing to be operationally oriented and related 
to logistics and that will come from the pentagon we do not have a 
time yet i would not anticipate it soon probably later in the 
morning i dont think theres any need for you all to stay here 
the rest of the night but you might want to hang around for a 
while anyway one final question 
q youre sending massively troops in to get one man 
a there are four objectives to this getting general noriega 
out is certainly one of the main ones it certainly is an 
objective yes thank you very much

calif were mobilized tuesday night for transport to an 
unannounced location while fort bragg nc units were on placed 
on alert army officials said 
soldiers of the 7th infantry division light which in some 
deployments includes artillery and aviation units were ordered to 
report to the fort ord army base for an emergency deployment 
readiness training exercise army spokesman jim davis said 
he said he could not comment on the number of soldiers their 
destination or time of departure 
spokesmen for the 82nd airborne division and 18th airborne corps 
early wednesday stood by a statement issued monday that the 
exercise at fort bragg was strictly routine 
periodically the army exercises the readiness of selected 
units said sgt 1st class dana jackson an 82nd division

air force base in fairfield calif late tuesday according to 
kcratv in sacramento but a base spokesman said he could not say 
where the soldiers came from or where they were going 
we cannot comment on any military operations at this time 
said sgt jerry taranto we cant comment on anything on the 
operation 
travis 90 miles north of fort ord was enveloped in heavy fog 
and no planes had taken off by late tuesday according to kcratv 
last year several thousand soldiers from the 7th infantry 
division were dispatched to panama for a prolonged training 
exercise the move was interpreted as an attempt to demonstrate 
us military might during the burgeoning dispute with panamas 
leader gen manuel noriega 
during last years mobilization troops from fort ord were bused 
to travis where they were airlifted to howard air force base in 
panama 
the united states has tried to extradict noriega who controls 
the panamanian military and the country since he was indicted on 
federal drug trafficking charges in february 1988 
about 12000 american soldiers are stationed along the panama 
canal 
us troops in panama have been on maximum alert and restricted

q is the fact that a step toward handing over the canal to the 
panamanians is scheduled to occur on jan 1 have anything to do 
with the timing of this operation now 
a i dont think is has to do with the timing but it certainly 
has to do with the substance we do have a responsibilty under the 
panama canal treaty for its safety and security and we do believe 
there have been threats that jeopardize the security of the treaty 
and that is one of the aspects of our purpose here 
q can you give us any details of a how its going b what the 
size of the us force that was amassed for this was and how long 
you think this operation might take 
a i really cant answer any of those questions in any great 
detail the united states is committing forces we believe are 
adequate to the task it is a major undertaking there are numbers 
of troops and equipment that have been dedicated to this task but 
i just want to wait until some later point to give any kind of 
logistical characterization of the size 
the president has been considering this matter for several days 
as you all know he was quite disturbed by the events of last 
weekend involving the killing of the united states marine and the 
harassment and threats to the naval officer and his wife the 
president reviewed this issue with his national security adivsers 
on sunday afternoon they considered options developed a plan and 
the president made the basic decision to proceed with this action 
since then there have been any number of meetings i will not go 
into details of when and how they were conducted but the president 
has been reviewing this matter on a continual basis since sunday 
and there really has not been any question about our willingness or 
our readiness to proceed since that time 
q what are the troops orders with regard to noriega were they 
ordered to try to take him alive and if they do what do you want 
them to do with him 
a their orders are to apprhenend gen noriega and our purpose 
is to return him to the united states for prosecution under our 
laws regarding drug trafficking gen noriega was indicted in the 
southern district of florida in miami and the northern district in 
tampa for drug trafficking and we want to bring him to the united 
states for prosecution under that indictment 
q who swore in endara under what legal authority and where is 
he now 
a i dont know who swore him in the legal authority of course 
was that they are the freely and openly elected leaders in the may 
elections and they are assuming office on that basis

nancy gephart dons a blue hospital gown once a 
week and does for strangers children what she used to do for her 
son she feeds them talks to them sings to them and holds them 
she is one of a growing number of hospital cuddlers who try 
to provide emotional support and a healing touch to sick children 
whose parents either cannot or will not do so 
nearly three decades ago gephart spent as much time as she 
could at her sons bedside at mount washington pediatric hospital 
as he lay suffering from rheumatic fever 
in those days visiting hours were very restricted but now 
parents are allowed to visit day or night but some of them 
dont gephart said some of the parents just cant face the 
severity of a childs medical problems 
susan kolodner the hospitals director of volunteers 
characterized the children as medically fragile adding 
this is their home for several months or even years and their 
parents cant be here all the time thats where the cuddlers come 
in to provide an extra pair of hands for the nurses and to 
provide the children with extra attention and love 
when mount washington began its cuddler program in 1986 
hospital officials were looking for the grandmother type 
kolodner said 
the first cuddlers came from a retirement home up the street 
at first i said i cant do that i dont have time said 
edith dobbs a retired nurse who lives at that home but i was so 
impressed with their orientation program and with the nurses 
when i left i was signed up for tuesday mornings and ive been 
here every tuesday morning for the last three years 
the program has since expanded to include volunteers of all 
ages the 60 current cuddlers range from early 20s to 84 kolodner 
said 
once mount washingtons cuddler program was established other 
area hospitals were swamped with calls asking about similar 
volunteer programs said debbie bangledorf volunteer programs 
coordinator for johns hopkins hospital and hopkins childrens 
center 
we kept getting requests from people saying do you have a 
cuddler program so we sat down and said hey lets do it 
bangledorf said its been an overwhelming success 
other hospitals have started similar programs in part to deal 
with the growing number of children born to drugdependent mothers 
addicted at birth the children require extra attention and 
nurturing to calm them 
sometimes it will take two hours just to get a baby to drink a 
few ounces of formula said gephart the nurses each have to 
take care of up to four patients they just dont have the time to 
sit for two hours with one baby 
michele jacobs a nurse at mount washington said the babies 
quickly learn to associate their nurses with the sometimes painful 
treatments they administer 
but they get to know the cuddlers and you can see their faces 
light up when a cuddler comes in jacobs said they dont 
associate the cuddlers with pain they associate them with loving 
and playing and cuddling the cuddlers are a major major help to 
the babies 
they know when they see us that were not anybody whos going 
to act on them said cuddler rochelle savetman we never hold 
them while theyre getting shots or medicine were just 
company for them 
jacobs said parents also are grateful for the cuddlers services 
they feel better knowing that if they cant be here there is 
someone who will watch over their children and give them comfort 
she said 
people say this is one of the most giving things you can do 
gephart said but its definitely a twoway street i get so much 
out of it just to see a child who has been unresponsive smile or 
to get a child to eat something or to sleep i get as much out of 
it as they do

new yorks highest court ruled the states 
harassment law unconstitutional saying speech that may be abusive 
is still protected by the first amendment 
the decision may spark challenges against such laws in other 
states attorneys said 
civil rights advocates applauded the decision and said it would 
prevent police officers from arresting people especially 
demonstrators for using language that could be considered 
offensive 
i think its clear now that you cant prosecute someone for 
cursing someone out on the street said norman siegel executive 
director of the new york civil liberties union 
the case involved a dispute in which a woman called a neighbor a 
bitch and her son a dog as they passed by her door the woman 
jackie dietze of raymondville also allegedly threatened to beat 
the crap out of the woman 
dietze 19 was sentenced to 15 days in jail and fined 50 
on tuesday the state court of appeals in a 70 decision threw 
out her conviction it ruled 52 that the law was unconstitutional 
the court said the harassment statute prohibits a substantial 
amount of constitutionally protected expression 
judge stewart hancock jr said the law needed to be undone 
because its continued existence presents a significant risk of 
prosecution for the mere exercise of free speech 
casual conversation may well be abusive and intended to annoy 
so too may be lighthearted banter or the earnest expression of 
personal opinion or emotion hancock said but unless speech 
presents a clear and present danger of some serious substantial 
evil it may neither be forbidden nor penalized 
most states have antiharassment statutes similar in intent to 
new yorks william e hellerstein a professor at the brooklyn law 
school and a specialist on the first amendment said the decision 
was bound to spur challenges in other states 
the us supreme court has not addressed the issue of whether 
words unless representing a direct threat to safety can 
constitute harassment hellerstein said 
this should be a victory for all of us in protecting 
liberty said douglas lasdon executive director of the legal 
action center for the homeless of tuesdays decision we dont 
want to become a society where people get intimidated for being 
creative or eccentric 
i guess the standard now is fighting words said nancy 
connell spokeswoman for state attorney general robert abrams who 
was on the losing end of the case you cannot say something that 
is going to incite someone to an immediate act of violence 
dietzes words drew tears from her neighbor shelly lazore 
dietze denied using the language cited in the court case and 
said that the incident with lazore stemmed from a feud over a 
boyfriend dietze said she was relieved that the case was over 
dietzes lawyer robert ballan said that while the decision may 
expand freedom of speech it could also have another impact 
there are people who are quite obnoxious and are in the habit 
of using foul language ballan said these people are going to 
feel like they can be as obnoxious as they wish 
but those are the effects of freedom he said 
st lawrence county district attorney charles gardner did not 
return telephone calls prosecutors had maintained that dietze 
stepped over the line of acceptable behavior and that the 
constitution doesnt apply to abusive language

as first word circulated concerning the 
american military against panamas manuel noriega senate 
republican leader robert dole said early wednesday he expects 
bipartisan support for president bushs commitment of troops in 
panama city 
we need to see how it plays out said dole in a telephone 
interview with the associated press i would guess there would be 
widespread bipartisan support for the president 
said sen jesse helms rnc ranking republican on the senate 
foreign relations committee the majority of the senate will feel 
good by this turn of events certainly i feel a lot better 
i called to tell the president my complements to the 
chef he said in a telephone interview from his home in raleigh 
nc he said he had been briefed on the operation just prior to the 
white house news conference announcing the military mission 
immediate congressional reaction was limited because congress is 
in recess and the white house announced its action at 1 am 
dole said bush called him shortly before the early morning white 
house news conference announcing the military mission 
he said the white house also was trying to reach senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine who was in mexico meeting with 
president carlos salinas de gortari but dole did not know if 
theyd gotten to him before the public announcment 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the senate foreign 
relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere also was briefed 
about the operation 
we dont believe it would be appropriate to comment at this 
point he said through his aide jason isaacson 
issacson said dodd spoke to secretary of state james baker and 
is monitoring these events very closely he is also making calls 
to other people in the region 
dodd has been generally supportive of president bush actions 
concerning noriega 
dole said he met with the elected panamanian officials dec 10 
and they were in effect pleading with us to do something about 
noriega 
helms said he has confidence in the leaders of panama sworn in 
tuesday night under american auspices and said he has no plans to 
bring up measures in the senate calling for the abdication of the 
canal treaties negotiated by former president jimmy carter even 
though he contines to oppose the treaties 
i believe them to be sensible rational people and some of my 
concern about the united states surrendering the canal has been 
diminished said helms

president bush made up his mind sunday to 
launch the us military strike against panamas manuel antonio 
noriega barely 24 hours after the slaying of an american marine 
officer outside noriegas military headquarters in panama city the 
white house said 
bush administration officials kept their plans secret until 
tuesday evening when news organizations began reporting heavy us 
military flights into panama where the united states has 12000 
troops based to protect the panama canal 
even as the pentagon was preparing the effort to capture noriega 
and allow panamanian opposition leaders to take over the 
government bush went as planned tuesday evening to a white house 
christmas party for 300 friends administration officials white 
house staff and reporters 
the president maintained silence sunday when asked for his 
reaction to the killing of the unarmed marine lieutenant who was 
trying to escape a panamanian defense force checkpoint after a 
wrong turn brought him and three other us soldiers close to 
noriegas headquarters 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater in an early morning 
briefing today announcing the move against noriega said bush has 
been considering this matter for several days he said the 
president was quite disturbed by the killing of the marine 
officer and harassment of a naval officer and his wife by 
panamanian soldiers at the same checkpoint 
the president reviewed this issue with his national security 
advisers on sunday afternoon they considered options developed a 
plan and the president made the basic decision to proceed with this 
action fitzwater said 
he added that there had been any number of meetings since 
sunday but emphasized there really has not been any question 
about our willingness or our readiness to proceed since that time 
the white house on sunday deplored the killing of the marine and 
said the incident was a consequence of the outlaw noriega 
regime imposed on panama against the will of the panamanian 
people who voted in may to elect opposition leader guillermo 
endara to the presidency 
noriega panamas military commander and de facto ruler 
nullified those elections on friday a legislature of noriega 
cronies declared the country in a state of war against the united 
states and named noriega its maximum leader 
bush in an interview monday with the associated press and other 
wire services expressed enormous frustration that the 
democratic system that was voted on in panama was totally put down 
by force 
he called the killing of the marine an enormous outrage and 
pointedly refused to rule out a military response 
bush had no public events on his schedule tuesday except the 
christmas party where he and wife barbara gaily posed with each 
guest for pictures in front of an enormous tree decorated with 
dolls from childrens stories and fables

deployments includes artillery and aviation units were ordered to

redoubt volcanos eruption subsided 
allowing scientists to get their closest look yet and holiday 
travelers got off the ground as fears eased that volcanic ash would 
clog jet engines 
the alaska volcano observatory said no more ash reached 
anchorage after a plume consisting mostly of gas gushed from the 
volcano early tuesday 
the plume appears to be moving primarily toward the southwest 
and west observatory geologist steve brantley said 
he said the volcano about 115 miles from anchorage sent forth 
little ash 
redoubt erupted thursday after 23 years the fallout brought 
anchorage air traffic to a virtual halt saturday as the hectic 
christmas travel season opened 
geologists made a research flight over redoubt on tuesday but 
clouds obscured the top of the 10197foot volcano and 
observations were limited brantley said he said earthquake 
activity beneath the volcano appeared to slacken early in the 
afternoon 
its too early to tell whether this indicates a significant 
change in the volcanos behavior or whether its just a shortterm 
fluctuation brantley said 
the main carrier serving the anchorageseattle route resumed 
regular operations tuesday and added flights to deal with a backlog 
of about 1200 passengers in anchorage 
were moving them alaska airlines spokesman lou cancelmi 
said we are also moving post office mail and weve got 
additional freighters scheduled its going pretty well 
at anchorage international aiport the operations office said 
crowds awaiting flights thinned as airlines began flying although 
some interstate carriers with relatively light alaska schedules did 
not resume service 
carriers serving alaska points from anchorage were back in the 
sky but some international lines continued to divert flights to 
airports elsewhere airport officials said 
about 70 of 240 passengers with tickets for korean airlines 
flight 25 remained in anchorage on tuesday for what they said were 
safety reasons said lee steiner kals customer relations manager 
in los angeles the others left aboard a koreabound flight early 
in the day 
last week a boeing 747 operated by klm royal dutch airlines 
fell about two miles after it passed through volcanic ash and lost 
power to all four engines the engines were restarted and the plane 
made an emergency landing at the anchorage airport 
steiner said the kal passengers who stayed behind would be put 
aboard the next available plane to korea but we dont know when 
that will be at this point it depends on the climatic conditions 
aside from passengers the us postal service continued to 
charter aircraft to haul the usual upsurge in holiday mail between 
anchorage and seattle 
by tuesday morning 60000 pounds of mail waited to be flown 
from anchorage some of it left from monday and the rest deposited 
overnight at the airports 24hour post office the postal service 
said 
about 90000 pounds awaited transportation north from seattle 
officials expected the backlogs to be cleared up by today

the four children of ecclesia leader 
eldridge broussard jr are returning to their fathers care for the 
first time since their 8yearold sister was beaten to death by 
four of his followers 
i want them home in time for christmas judge robert j 
morgan said in setting today as a deadline for the children to be 
released to their parents 
it will be good to get my children back broussard told 
reporters at the conclusion of the fourday custody hearing 
a clackamas county circuit court judge agreed last month to 
allow custodial visits to resume between broussard his wife and 
their surviving children 
the broussard children ages 5 to 11 have been in state care 
since the sensational child abuse case erupted thirtythree 
ecclesia children remain in foster homes according to the state 
childrens services division 
on oct 14 1988 the body of dayna broussard was taken to a 
rural fire station by members of the ecclesia athletic association 
a religious and athletic training group founded by broussard in the 
watts section of los angeles 
the next day state juvenile authorities were dispatched to 
ecclesias farmhouse east of portland where they found 55 hungry 
abused children crammed into four bedrooms the youngsters were 
loaded onto buses and turned over to the childrens services 
division 
broussard who was in california at the time of the beating 
defended the four ecclesia staff members charged with firstdegree 
manslaughter 
he denied that he was a cult leader and that the ecclesia 
children had been mistreated but during the trial four of the 
children testified how they had witnessed young daynas punishment 
for taking food from another childs plate they said they were 
forced to watch and count the blows more than 800 
in may three men and a woman were convicted in the killing and 
they were sentenced to maximum 20year prison terms in june later 
a fifth member was convicted of criminal mistreatment for beating 
other children 
by that time the ecclesia athletic association had disbanded 
and broussard who once defended his group on oprah winfreys 
television show had begun to fade from the public eye 
on the anniversary of the beating death 40 of the children 
remained in foster homes childrens services division officials 
said their parents had refused to admit past abuses or to promise 
they would be safe from abuse 
the following week there was a turning point in the case when 
broussard appeared at a custody hearing for his 3yearold nephew 
for the first time he acknowledged that ecclesia members had been 
culpable in his daughters death 
the response was immediate from morgan who ruled the boy could 
be returned to his parents by years end 
the following month broussard and his wife returned to court to 
request custody of their own children 
broussard broke into tears while defending his assertion that 
adult ecclesia members put group concerns ahead of the childrens 
needs 
morgan told broussard he was moved by his show of emotion 
maybe its says something that hasnt been said before said 
morgan everyone is sorry it happened its now history we must 
look ahead 
on nov 16 the broussards custody request was granted 
the parents were given a list of 11 conditions to meet among 
them that corporal punishment would be forbidden and that the 
children must attend public schools and undergo regular mental 
health counseling 
state childrens services division spokesman bart wilson 
confirmed tuesday that the broussards were give the final goahead 
on dec 13 but he declined to reveal further details of the 
familys plans

the woman who won control of seven 
frozen human embryos in an unprecedented custody dispute has 
remarried and lawyers for her exhusband say that could help them 
when the case is appealed 
mary sue davis who has been living in florida since the august 
divorce trial married james stowe in cape canaveral last week 
attorneys janet mayfield and charles clifford said the 
remarriage could bolster their case of junior lewis davis before 
the state court of appeals 
the lawyers said the remarriage renders moot two of mrs davis 
contentions during the trial that the seven embryos created by her 
and davis at a knoxville fertility clinic last year might represent 
her last chance to become pregnant and that fertilization clinics 
would not take her as a client if she were single 
my client always maintained this wasnt her last chance ms 
mayfield said if the court of appeals adopts the reasoning well 
ask them to to balance the interests of the two adults then i 
think the remarriage would affect the balance 
that was not however the reasoning adopted by the trial judge 
w dale young of blount county circuit court 
young ruled that the embryos are essentially unborn human beings 
with rights of their own and decided the case based on what he 
felt was best for the embryos 
based on that ruling this doesnt affect his reasoning at 
all ms mayfield said 
but she said she believes mrs davis remarriage makes a 
psychological difference to the court 
she said it will be the spring before the appeals court hears 
the case

jacqueline onassis dispute with the wampanoag 
indians over a prime beachfront property that the indians say 
contain the graves of a chief and his wife may soon be resolved 
lawyers for both sides say 
wampanoag lore holds that chief moshup and his wife squant are 
buried on the disputed marthas vineyard land moshup according to 
the oral tradition threw his children into the sea when he saw the 
white man approaching 
mrs onassis bought a 17 percent interest in the gay head beach 
property in 1980 from a wampanoag family that has owned the 
property since the state surveyed and divided up gay head in 1870 
a hearing expected to settle the matter of the 264foot stretch 
of coastal property was set for feb 2 onassis attorney brian 
hurley said tuesday 
there have been negotiations but were not quite there yet 
he said the beach is held in undivided interest by more than 25 
individuals including mrs onassis but since she purchased her 
part of the beach the widow of president kennedy has fought the 
matter in court her private 380acre retreat surrounds the beach 
paul sulla a boston attorney and gay head resident representing 
the indians said a settlement was close he declined to discuss 
the terms 
the wampanoag are descendants of the islands first settlers 
mrs onassis bought the acreage for her home in the mid1970s 
and since then has brought a series of legal actions in an attempt 
to clear the title on the adjoining land 
in turn the wampanoag sued mrs onassis to retain access to the 
property

prime minister margaret thatcher on wednesday 
hailed as courageous the us invasion of panama and declared the 
rule of democracy must be upheld 
mrs thatcher spoke to reporters on the steps of her downing 
street office after president bush telephoned her at 7 am 2 am 
est to tell her he had sent in us troops to seize panamanian 
gen manuel antonio noriega wanted on us drug charges 
i said we would fully support him in the action he was taking 
to bring an end to this rule of terror said mrs thatcher i 
believe he was right to do so i believe this is what friends are 
for to give support at this time it was a courageous decision 
mrs thatcher called on other world leaders to declare support 
for bush saying every action has a risk and it is important that 
it be successful 
gen noriega is wanted on drugs allegations in the united 
states we are fighting terror and the battle against drugs as 
well the rule of democracy should be upheld she added 
a government spokesman said bush told mrs thatcher she was the 
first foreign head of the government he had called with the news 
they talked for 10 minutes 
mrs thatchers warm response contrasted with her public 
criticism of the usled invasion of grenada in 1983 to overthrow 
a leftist administration that had seized power in the caribbean 
island grenada is a former british colony that regards britains 
queen elizabeth ii as its titular head of state 
britains opposition labor party criticized the panama invasion 
saying it had nothing to do with democracy in panama and 
everything to do with protecting the american interests in the 
canal zone 
i think everyone agrees that noriega is a nasty dictator but 
thats not the reason for the intervention labors foreign 
affairs spokesman george foulkes said in a british broadcasting 
corp radio interview 
the main reason is that the americans have got a key interest 
in the panama canal zone they have therefore decided to take 
the law into their own hands

government with arrests and corruption charges on july 27 besides 
the 11 indicted usry and two others were arrested in the sweep 
that culminated an eightmonth investigation 
usry 67 was led away from his home by police in a roundup of 
suspects authorities said 6000 in cash was found in his home 
but the mayors attorney said the money was a contribution from a 
businessman that usry was to relay to a childrens charity

one of the most prominent black republican officials in the nation 
including usry who was elected as a reformer four of 
atlantic citys last seven mayors have been arrested

end truth will win out

car wash 
dorn was accused in the indictment of taking a 7500 cash bribe

my head was clobbered each time 
i was collecting tickets and then all hell broke loose said 
conductor gary burke i wound up flying into the next car

is shylock the infamous moneylender of william 
shakespeares the merchant of venice victim or villain 
dustin hoffman opts for mildmannered victim in peter halls 
straightforward ungimmicky production of the play which opened 
tuesday at broadways 46th street theater hoffman was the reason 
this problematic comedy was a hot ticket in london last summer and 
why it was brought to broadway for what looks like a soldout 
12week run 
the stars fans wont be disappointed but his almost genial 
approach robs the play of much of its emotional depth and shylock 
of his complexity dressed in a flowing robe his long hair pulled 
back tightly under a skullcap the bearded hoffman jokes and grins 
in a manner that would not be out of place in the current lincoln 
center revival of paddy chayefskys the tenth man 
his voice flavored with an appropriate jewish accent is strong 
and projects well shylocks impassioned speech defending his 
jewishness is delivered quietly with a somber dignity that is 
hoffmans best moment in the play 
his shylock is an accommodating man especially when he agrees 
to lend money to antonio in exchange for a pound of flesh if the 
borrower defaults shylock meekly suffers humiliation if revenge 
is on his mind he doesnt let anyone know at least until he 
thinks he can win 
hall clearly sees shylock as a survivor of persecution in a 
society where antisemitism was rampant the venetian christians are 
the real villains of the piece louts who spit in the jews face 
steal his daughter and even force him to become a christian before 
the final curtain 
if shylocks plight is heavily underlined in halls production 
his tragedy is never fully explored or realized by the star the 
loss of his daughter to lorenzo a christian and even the 
forfeiture of his own faith dont seem like the devastating blows 
they should be theres no sense of tragedy when the defeated 
shylock walks out of the courtroom to the jeers and harassment of 
the crowd 
at the same time his villainy during the famous courtroom scene 
seems unemotional almost perfunctory hoffman earns laughs rather 
than hisses when he sharpens his knife to collect the pound of 
flesh and cheers on the judge when he appears to be winning his 
case 
hall has better success with the lighter more romantic aspects 
of the play the scenes in which the three suitors must pick the 
right casket if they are to win the fair portia are staged as 
pageants complete with a stage full of extras strange music 
exotic costumes 
geraldine james in the plays real star role is a radiant 
portia witty as well as intelligent and with a charming 
competitiveness that would endear her to the most ardent feminist 
her interpretation of the quality of mercy speech one of 
the best known in the shakespeare is a revelation and the heart 
of the play she speaks these lines as if shes giving a bit of 
sensible advice rather than commanding the stage for a star turn 
leigh lawson is a sobersided but not morose antonio the 
merchant whose life is nearly lost for friendship most of the 
younger performers in the large cast perfectly capture the gaiety 
of what are some of shakespeares best romantic scenes nathaniel 
parker is properly impassioned as the lovestruck bassanio while 
michael siberry is a terrific gratiano turning the usually 
longwinded boor into a funny wellmeaning best friend 
chris dyers setting is impressively adaptable a series of 
reddishbrown pillars that can turn quickly from a venetian street 
scene to idyllic belmont to the dukes palace by the dropping of a 
curtain or the unfurling of a long red carpet 
the merchant of venice makes a lot of modern audiences 
uncomfortable with its episodes of virulent prejudice alternating 
with a love story that seems almost like a fairy tale this 
production captures the lighter sunnier hues of shakespeares 
romance but the darker shadows of the play elude both hoffman and 
hall 
the play opened to general praise from broadway critics for 
halls production and also for hoffman all said james gives the 
best performance 
clive barnes of the new york post said hoffman triumphed a 
deliberately modest triumph but his own he also praised halls 
production for being refreshingly simple making shakespeare a 
pleasure 
linda winer of new york newsday questioned halls production 
saying it was difficult to understand the balance between tragedy 
and comedy but she said hoffman was the best thing about the 
play 
the daily news howard kissel was the only critic to flatly 
criticize hoffman he said if hoffman were an unknown actor he 
would not have won the part he also faulted halls production 
calling it abrasive 
frank rich of the new york times said the production is 
unexpected because romance and comedy are restored making it 
highly watchable he said halls shylock does not dominate as would 
be normal in the play but hoffmans performance is a character 
actors polished gem

swimming pool right about the same time i heard gunfire 
it was about midnight and the us assault had started 
i made for the hotels main building with several other 
reporters when a man with an assault rifle appeared and said hit 
the floor 
he herded us over into the lobby which was full of people 
the gunmen took peoples passports they searched my bag 
about a dozen of the men took charge of me and 11 other 
foreigners including two other correspondents 
i never saw more than 20 armed men in the hotel 
they told us they had surrounded the building were being 
invaded so were taking hostages the man who appeared to be 
their leader said 
they did not threaten me personally but they made it clear that 
they could kill us all there were about eight americans in our 
group 
gruson and i tried to persuade the men to let us call our 
offices to tell the story of the invasion 
we saw them herding the guests and staff into the grand 
ballroom a man in a silk bathrobe kept saying to the captors 
im chilean im chilean 
the armed men eventually let me retrieve my bag and notebook 
my money had been taken and they let me remain in the lobby 
gruson went upstairs where he said he was threatened by one of 
the gunmen who kept pointing his assault rifle at him at one 
point the gunman put the muzzle of his weapon against grusons 
mouth he told me later 
about 145 am a few other hostages and i were herded into a 
red van at gunpoint and driven to a private home in the wealthy 
neighborhood where the panmanian leader gen manuel antonio 
noriega lives we were ordered into the service area off the 
kitchen and made to sit on the floor 
our captors let us have water and smoke cigarettes 
we were there until 4 am i kept hearing aircraft passing low 
overhead sporadic gunfire from automatic weapons things were 
tapering off 
between 330 am and 4 am the phone rang three times 
more hostagetakers showed up then a man who appeared to be 
their leader said were going to let you go we dont want to 
kill you tell the truth about panama were not killers 
there are hundreds of dead in the central barracks 
the men seemed very sad one was crying 
they put us back into a van and let us out in the street i

a man who felt he was a failure committed 
suicide outside a hospital in an effort to save a brother with 
heart disease but the body was found too late and his heart could 
not be used for a transplant 
gerald olson 46 drove his van monday evening to university 
community hospital in tamarac and parked outside the emergency 
room authorities said tuesday then he put a gun into his mouth 
and pulled the trigger 
ten minutes passed before a nurse on her way home noticed olson 
slumped over the steering wheel an emergency medical crew 
administered heart massage but he died less than an hour later 
police found suicide notes in the van in which olson complained 
of too many downs and no ups for me on this roller coaster ride 
of life olson wrote that he wanted his heart donated to his 
56yearold brother bob olson who has been on a waiting list for 
a heart transplant for nearly three years 
his main purpose for committing suicide at the hospital was 
to make his heart available for his brother said sheriffs 
detective steve wiley unfortunately he failed 
it made me feel like someone special bob olson said from 
his home in belvedere ill he thought of me in his last 
thoughts he wanted somebody benefiting from his death 
i love my brother olson added sobbing im going to miss 
him 
the elder olson who was diagnosed as having cardiomyopathy 
which causes an enlarged heart and other relatives said they 
recognized jerry olson did not succeed in life as he might have 
wished but they said they had no idea he might be suicidal

do if hed only gone and done it said roland olson 58 who 
lives in rockford said of his younger brother 
instead jerry olson worked in lounges and sold bar supplies he 
was unemployed in recent months jerry moved to tamarac about eight 
years ago to help a sister after her husband died of a heart 
attack roland said 
but three weeks ago she asked her brother to move out 
according to wiley she thought it was time for him to stand on 
his own two feet the detective said since then jerry olson had 
lived in his van wiley said 
on sunday jerry olson recorded a tape an elvis presley fan who 
named his daughter lisa marie same as the singers daughter he 
sang ill be home for christmas and in two letters asked that 
the song be played at his funeral

come to this honey but lately theres been too many downs and no 
ups for me on this roller coaster ride of life

art buchwald amused court spectators with his 
wry humor but said there was nothing funny about what he called 
paramount pictures theft of his idea for the film coming to 
america 
its very hard for a humorist to be taken seriously in 
something like this the pulitzer prizewinning columnist 
testified tuesday in his 5 million lawsuit against paramount i 
feel this is a very serious matter i feel my property has been 
stolen raped whatever you want to call it 
paramount contends there are no similarities between buchwalds 
idea and the hit movie starring eddie murphy the trial was to 
continue today 
asked by paramount attorney robert draper if the studios 
chairman martin davis is a good friend of buchwald the humorist 
said he used to be 
buchwald said davis did not seem to know about the 
breachofcontract suit until the two encountered each other at a 
party last year 
the next thing i know a bottle of dom perignon arrives at my 
desk with a copy of a recording called sue me buchwald 
recalled i sent him back a note that said anyone who sends a 
bottle of dom perignon is guilty 
buchwald said paramount optioned his story its a crude 
crude world in 1982 then changed its title to king for a day 
and spent nearly 500000 trying to develop it as a movie for 
murphy 
paramount abruptly dropped its option in 1985 and buchwald and 
his coplaintiff producer alain bernheim took the idea to warner 
bros buchwald told superior court judge harvey schneider on 
tuesday his second day of testimony in the nonjury trial 
but buchwald said that warner bros dropped the idea in 1987 
when word spread that paramount was producing a similar story 
draper said he has decided against calling murphy as a witness 
in the case because of the circus atmosphere that accompanied 
the appearance monday of latenight talk show host arsenio hall 
hall testified that he and murphy conceived the idea for 
coming to america in which hall also starred murphy testified 
likewise in a deposition 
buchwalds 2page script idea and coming to america were

for the second time in seven months 
guillermo endara has been declared president of panama and once 
again it comes amid violent clashes between his supporters and 
those who back gen manuel antonio noriega 
endara a portly affable lawyer and former law professor was 
sworn in as president today after us troops in a bid to oust 
noriega launched an assault on the country 
his opposition activities date back more than two decades to 
when he served in the national assembly under arnulfo arias madrid 
panamas grand old man of the opposition 
endara was arias spokesman in panama until arias died in miami 
in 1988 in selfimposed exile he used to speak amost dreamily of 
the day when arias would return as a sign of providence to lead 
the country 
in may endara himself was chosen to lead the country in a 
presidential election exit polls showed endara and his two 
vicepresidential candidates with an edge of about 31 but noriega 
nullified the results ignoring the outcry at home and abroad 
three days after the vote men wearing tshirts of noriegas 
dignity battalions battered endara and his two 
vicepresidential candidates in a bloody street scene captured by 
foreign cameras 
endara spent his 53rd birthday in a hospital bed recovering 
from the attack 
they were not battalions and they have no dignity endara 
said in a hospital interview as supporters held up his bloodied 
guayabera a short sleeved smocktype shirt favored by many 
latins 
he staged a hunger strike to press noriega to accept his victory 
and urged his supporters not to accept the military man as their 
leader 
endara a veteran member of the panamanista party ran very much 
in the shadow of arias 
endara lost control of the party in december to hildebrando 
nicosia who ran as a thirdparty candidate in may and finished 
third 
the opposition liberal authentic party adopted endara and the 
coalition democratic opposition alliance ran him for president 
endara served twice in the national assembly and was arias 
minister of planning and economic policy in 1968 when arias was 
thrown out of office for the third time after only serving 11 days 
as president 
endara went into hiding was jailed for a time and eventually 
fled to exile 
when arias reorganized his party as the authentic panamanist 
party in 1983 after a long ban on political activity in panama 
endara helped 
endara who studied at the university of panama in argentina 
and in new york lacked arias charisma and spent most of his time 
behind the scenes of the oppositions seemingly endless attempts to 
replace the de facto military power that began its ironfisted rule 
21 years ago 
in a preelection interview he put faith in the hope that the 
democratic process in panama would prevail electoral fraud or not 
he said if he won noriega would be given a chance to leave 
gracefully and be fired if he refused 
 
noriega hired and fired presidents pretty much at will after 
taking over the military in 1983 
his last victim was eric delvalle who tried to fire noriega 
after the general was indicted on drug charges last year in the 
united states even so endara said he trusted the democratic 
process 
remember delvalle was in very different circumstances he 
said he was a puppet of the military by the fraud of 1984 
thats the price you pay for not being a democratically elected 
person you are subject to the decisions of the military 
he and his wife marcella have one daughter also named 
marcella

president ramaswamy venkataraman 
outlining the policies of indias new government said today there 
would be no compromises in tackling seccessionist campaigns by sikh 
and moslem militants 
in a speech prepared by prime minister vp singhs government 
venkataraman told a joint session of parliament that new efforts 
must be made to halt religious strife and corruption 
the president whose post is largely ceremonial also said india 
would retain friendly ties with the soviet union and united states 
seek to solve a border dispute with china and strengthen economic 
ties with japan 
singh whose centrist national front alliance took office after 
forging a coalition with hindu rightwingers and secular 
communists listened attentively in the front row of the central 
hall of parliament 
rajiv gandhi whose fiveyear tenure as prime minister ended in 
the november election debacle for his congress party took notes 
venkataraman noting that voters had given a clear verdict in 
favor of change said the new government would strive to meet the 
challenges ahead 
the punjab problem has defied solution so far he said 
referring to the sikh separatist movement that has claimed more 
than 7000 lives in the past six years and triggered the 1984 
assassination of gandhis mother prime minister indira gandhi 
there will be no compromise with separatism and no yielding to 
extremists but there is admittedly a compelling need for a 
national endeavor to resolve the problem the whitehaired 
president said 
he said singhs government would broaden the discussions it has 
already initiated on finding a political solution for punjab 
indias most prosperous farming state 
the nationally televised 15minute speech set out a course of 
action for government but gave few specifics it was delivered in 
the same parliament hall where indias independence was proclaimed 
at midnight on aug 14 1947 
turning to kashmir where propakistan moslems seek to secede 
from india venkataraman vowed there will be no compromise on 
the countrys unity sovereignty and integrity 
the 2weekold government of singh has already had its first 
serious challenge from kashmiri militants on dec 8 militants 
kidnapped the daughter of home minister mufti mohammad sayeed also 
a kashmiri moslem 
the young woman a hospital intern was released unharmed after 
six days when the government freed five moslem extremists 
in a reference to hindumoslem riots that claimed more than 300 
lives this fall in other states the president said violence has 
no place in the land of mahatma gandhi the apostle of 
nonviolence 
he was referring to indian independence leader mohandas k 
gandhi 
venkataraman said that under singh whose chief campaign pledge 
was to eradicate government corruption legislation would be 
introduced to appoint an ombudsman or watchdog whose jurisdiction 
would include the prime minister

opposition leader guillermo endara winner of may elections the 
noriegacontrolled government nullified was sworn in as president 
and given immediate us backing 
president bush in a nationwide broadcast in the united states 
said noriega was in hiding and the action is not over yet 
tragically some americans have lost their lives in defense of 
their fellow citizens in defense of democray he said we also 
regret and mourn the loss of innocent panamanians 
the invasion by american troops is the violent climax of 
washingtons long battle with the cagey military leader who had 
set up a succession of puppet presidents while running a military 
empire that purportedly trafficked in colombian cocaine 
the bellicose noriega survived two coup attempts a losing 
election and tough us economic sanctions while brashly flouting 
washingtons futile attempts to break his grip on power 
the panama canal where about 30 ships cross the isthmus daily 
was closed at 1 am because of the fighting according to panama 
canal commission spokesman franklin castrellon he said landslides 
had caused the only previous canal closings 
the capitals sky was bright with the light of gunfire for 
hours blackedout planes and helicopters roared overhead under a 
full moon 
the us assault began about midnight as forces dispatched from 
us bases attacked panamanian military headquarters which 
witnesses in nearby apartments said was in flames at 1240 am and 
virtually destroyed by 2 am 
american troops from bases in the united states were airlifted 
in on tuesday to augment the 12000 soldiers based in panama 
powell said another 9500 troops from us bases were sent to 
augment the force 
bush said noriegas reckless behavior had created an 
imminent danger to the 35000 american citizens living in panama 
fighting also was reported at a panamanian cavalry unit about 
seven miles east of the defense forces headquarters and at the 
panamanian base fort cimarron about 20 miles from the capital 
noriegas main bodyguard lt asuncion gaitan spoke on the 
national radio network after dawn to say that noriega was well 
and in a safe place 
dont anyone give up your positions in the provinces prepare 
to resist the attacks are going to continue when they find we are 
not going to cede he said 
gaitan who is wellknown as noriegas prime bodyguard and is 
with noriega whenever the general is seen in public then gave a 
series of messages using code names and instructions the codes 
mentioned names like alex omar or said alex take the man 
to the hangar and yeyo 
others were more comprehensible one was a reference to the 
socalled civilian dignity battalions of noriega loyalists 
dignity battalions operate in small operations during the day 
or look for positions and mix with the people who support you and 
at night move and act against the enemy positions in the periphery 
of the city ran one 
meanwhile casualty reports were climbing dr marcel pena of 
the santo tomas hospital in panama city said wounded had been 
coming in all night and the number increased with daybreak 
there are many more than 50 dead and an enormous number of 
wounded he said earlier doctors had said there were at least 
50 dead at the hospital 
hospitals were short of blood surgical materials and other 
supplies and were issuing international appeals for help he said 
fighting after dawn was still continuing in old panama just 
east of the marriott and in san miguelito a poor district hill 
district northeast of the city center where some of the strongest 
dignity battalions are based us forces were apparently trying to 
take the panama defense forces barracks at san miguelito and 
helicopters were buzzing the area 
on friday noriegas rubberstamp declared that the country was 
in a state of war with the united states and named the general 
head of state to deal with the threat a day later a us military 
officer was shot to death by panamanians in what american officials 
called an unprovoked attack

thirtyeight latin american stablehands seized at 
a racetrack a year ago have taken the fifth amendment challenging 
the government to prove they are illegal aliens the government 
says it doesnt have to to deport them 
while illegal immigrants often dont know their rights and 
prefer to go home rather than fight to stay the boston cases are 
being regarded as a test of aliens rights 
the immigration and naturalization service is saying the 
government doesnt have to come up with any evidence at all said 
attorney susan akram who is orchestrating the aliens defense 
the ins has never brought a shred of evidence 
its a test of what the government burden is said akram 
head of the political asylum immigration representation project 
can the government haul anybody in off the streets and deport 
them if they refuse to answer questions based on their 
constitutional right not to do so this is ridiculous 
the defendants were among 83 salvadoran mexican brazilian and 
cuban stablehands rounded up oct 21 1988 at suffolk downs during 
a dawn workout 
of the 83 people six were found to be in the united states 
lawfully some went home while others admitted their illegal 
status and applied for asylum 
the rest invoked their fifth amendment guarantee against 
selfincrimination at their deportation hearings they want the 
government to prove they are here illegally 
that isnt happening instead ins attorneys are using an 
argument allowed in civil cases that silence alone is ground for 
deportation 
charles wheeler director of the national center for immigrants 
rights in los angeles called this development alarming 
its disturbing if the immigration judge is making an 
inference from their silence that a person is an alien he said 
it reverses the whole idea that you are innocent until proven 
guilty 
but an ins official says the government is following precedent 
wellestablished in civil cases 
the government doesnt have to do any more said michael 
creppy acting deputy counsel for the ins in washington this is 
nothing new the law is pretty clear in this matter to me its 
just a tactic to be able to stay here 
among the 38 aliens who invoked the fifth amendment was 
21yearold salvadoran his story is typical said akram who 
requested the man be identified only as jay 
one of 10 children in a farming family jay is from the 
mountains of el salvador where the army and the antigovernment 
guerrillas have been waging war he said both sides terrorize the 
inhabitants 
jay told his attorney that by age 19 he was forced to act four 
times as a lookout on a guerrilla patrol he knew better than to 
object after seeing a friends face shot off for refusing to act as 
a guerrilla informant 
last year jay fled taking a bus to mexico from there he 
crossed the us border undetected and made his way from california 
to massachusetts 
two months ago jay had his day in immigration court the 
attorney for the ins questioned him about where he came from and 
how he got here 
jay replied in spanish i refuse to answer under the 
protection of the fifth amendment of the united states because my 
answer could incriminate me the ins lawyer then asked the judge 
to deport him 
jays case is on appeal before the board of immigration appeals 
wheeler said the use of the fifth amendment in deportation cases 
is rare but crucial 
its an important defense and it would be a tragic betrayal if 
this was taken away from aliens he said 
the ins creppy said the agency feels it will win 
when you weigh the public interest versus the aliens 
interest this is a case that is clear he said

opposition politicians said they 
hoped the us invasion of panama would bring democracy to the 
country but supporters of gen manuel antonio noriega called it 
genocide against panama 
the us decision to remove the obstacle of the dictatorship 
was serious news but we grasp it with hope said ricardo arias 
calderon who was sworn in as first vice president shortly after 
the us effort began 
arias who spoke on the radio was a vice presidential candidate 
in the may 7 elections that were voided when results showed noriega 
opponents winning 
guillermo endara was sworn in as president and guillermo ford 
was sworn in as vice president along with arias 
tomorrow we will have the opportunity to celebrate the era of 
democracy with justice and freedom endara said he urged the 
noriegas defense forces dont resist accept instead the peace 
that they offer 
ford said the military action grieves us because it involves 
mourning and pain but we pray to god that it will be the new 
awakening of this nation we love so much 
arias said he hoped with this action we can achieve the 
panamanian objectives among them to immediately establish 
democracy with full respect for the will of the people 
noriegas democratic revolutionary party held an emergency 
meeting at an undisclosed site said the government national radio 
broadcasting as the national resistance network 
carlos duque noriegas presidential candidate in the may 7 
elections called on all nationalist parties to join in the 
struggle 
the united states has just committed the biggest error and is 
going to pay for that he said 
rigoberto paredes another party leader called the us action 
an infamous invasion he asked latin american countries to tell 
the united states to stop this genocide against panama 
we are not going to surrender he said 
not all those outraged by the invasion were noriega backers 
a woman in diablo just south of the us army base at fort 
clayton said this is humiliating i feel completely impotent 
my blood is boiling she said she does not support noriega but 
also does not support the idea of a us invasion 
as she spoke us trucks passed on a nearby road and fighting 
raged near defense forces headquarters 
they are not going to enjoy it she said

here is the text of statements at the pentagon 
wednesday by defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and questions they fielded 
at a news conference 
 
cheney 
i think all of you have seen the presidents statement 
explaining the action that he ordered and explaining the background 
and the rationale for it obviously weve tried for more than two 
years to resolve by peaceful means the difficult relationship that 
had developed with the government of panama 
this past week it came to a head with the declaration of manuel 
noriega as a maximum leader and his statement that a state of war 
existed between panama and the united states 
that was of course followed by the shooting death of an 
unarmed american offduty marine officer on saturday and the brutal 
treatment of other us military personnel and dependents 
on sunday the president made the decision to order us forces 
to panama specifically as he indicated earlier with the mission 
of protecting american lives of protecting american interests in 
connection with our responsibilities under the panama canal treaty 
with the effort being made also to restore democracy and to bring 
gen noriega to justice should we capture him 
the order went out late on sunday to implement a plan that had 
been in existence for some time it was one of the first items i 
was briefed on when i became secretary of defense last spring 
the plan was developed to deal with various contingencies that 
might arise in panama we have always been concerned for several 
months by virtue of the fact that there are large numbers of 
americans in panama not only those that are there because theyve 
been assigned there because of their military role and 
responsibilities but also american civilians who live in the area 
the operation is continuing at this time some of the reporting 
we have obviously is still fragmentary its our intention this 
morning in this briefing to give you as much information as we 
reasonably can given the fact that the operation continues 
at this point of course gen noriega is still at large he is 
no longer the maximum leader in panama a democratic government has 
been reestablished with the duly elected officials selected by the 
people of panama last may he is at this point a fugitive 
as secretary i want to thank all of those individuals who 
participated in the operation it has been carried out in an 
extremely professional manner i think they have performed superbly 
in carrying out their duties and their responsibilities 
and at this point id like to turn the briefing over to the 
chairman of the joint chiefs gen powell 
 
powell 
thank you mr secretary let me add my own caution that the 
operation is only seven hours old and it is still ongoing and may 
be continuing for some time to come so were going to give you as 
much as we possibly can but please understand that there will be 
details that i cannot get into for purposes of operational security 
as you know at the direction of the president united states 
armed forces undertook operations in combat in panama just prior to 
0100 hours this morning or roughly just before 1 am this morning 
the participating units include inplace forces in panama the 
193rd infantry brigade which in recent months had been reinforced 
by marine units by a battalion from the 7th infantry division at 
fort ord calif by a mechanized battalion from the 5th infantry 
division at fort polk la as well as additional supporting forces 
to include military police 
in the course of the evening additional forces have been added 
and ill describe how they have been added those additional forces 
include a brigade of the 82nd airborne division two ranger 
battalions selected special operating units 
all of this of course was supported superbly by the united 
states air force and the united states navy and there are 
additional reinforcing units that will assist in stability 
operations coming from the 7th infantry division at fort ord 
calif as well as from the 16th mp brigade at fort bragg nc as 
you know our purpose as stated by the president is to protect 
americans to protect the integrity of our treaty to restore 
democracy in panama and bring to justice the fugitive mr noriega 
we conducted operations this morning beginning just before 1 
am in three general areas that gen kelly will point out on the 
map 
first in the central panama canal zone area to the east of 
that near the international airfield and to the west down by rio 
hato 
let me now turn to the larger map and discuss each one of these 
pieces in turn 
lets start up on the atlantic caribbean side with task force 
atlantic task force atlantic consisted of a battalion from the 7th 
infantry division and a battalion from the 82nd airborne division 
which was in the jungle operations training center in panama 
their mission was to secure several critical sites in the 
southern portion of task force atlantic ao the prison at gamboa 
which was secured in the course of the morning and within which 
there are some pdf personnel who had been put in jail as a result 
of the coup attempt earlier in the fall and we now have some 47 
48 very happy prisoners who have been released the electrical 
distribution center at sierra tigre is now secure and madden dam 
a critical facility is also secure 
other elements of task force atlantic also ensured the security 
of our installations in the colon area and they neutralized the 
8th infantry company of the pdf which did not take too active a 
role in this operation as well as neutralizing the naval infantry 
unit located up toward the north 
there is still some sporadic firing up there the situation 
isnt completely resolved but for the most part task force 
atlantic has completed its assigned missions

communist party chief karel 
urbanek today said the party leadership had made mistakes marked by 
negligence and irresponsibility that led the organization into 
its worst crisis 
speaking to 1500 delegates at a special party congress urbanek 
also admitted his own guilt as a member of the ruling politburo in 
allowing hated hardliners to remain in the party leadership 
the party was expected to purge its ranks of many discredited 
party leaders during the twoday meeting 
the communists have been rocked by two shakeups in the 
leadership to remove hardliners and the loss of thousands of 
members since the countrys peaceful prodemocracy movement began 
four weeks ago changing the political orientation of the country 
the congress called to determine the partys future in the wake 
of a revolution that swept a government led by noncommunist into 
office scrapped all its party statutes which could pave the way 
for a comprehensive organizational reform 
party spokesman josef hora told reporters the congress also 
decided to divide the leadership duties between a general secretary 
and a party chairman 
former premier ladislav adamec who resigned earlier this month 
after failing to reach agreement with the opposition on a new 
government was thought to be a contender for one of the posts 
according to congress observers who spoke on condition of anonymity 
on nov 24 the party ousted hardline leader milos jakes and 
others responsible for the crackdown on the prague spring 
reforms of 1968 and urbanek replaced jakes as party chief 
the much despised prague party boss miroslav stepan was ousted 
two days later in a further leadership reshuffle that brought 
unknown communists to the top stepans ouster was demanded by 
massive protest rallies 
both jakes and stepan were later expelled from the party for 
serious political mistakes they had refuted assertions by a 
parliamentary commission that they were politically responsible for 
a nov 17 police crackdown on peaceful student demonstrators that 
ignited the ensuing democratic revolution 
urbanek said the party leadership manifested negligence and 
irresponsibility worthy of punishment 
with selfcriticism i admit my part of the guilt in leaving 
stepan on the poliburo urbanek said adding that the decision was 
an extraordinary politically serious mistake 
outlining the crisis now faced by the party urbanek noted that 
it had lost 66290 of its 17 million members in the last month 
urbanek also revealed that the party faces bankruptcy 
disclosing that party dues were used to build recreation facilities 
for the top brass about which the rankandfile only learned 
today 
the speech confirmed the total disarray in which the party finds 
itself following the triumphs of the prodemocracy movement 
the most recent victory came on tuesday as the 
communistdominated parliament gave the new reform government a 
vote of confidence and endorsed opposition leader vaclav havel for 
president 
there is no doubt that the congress delegates have the duty 
to take the party out of its deepest crisis ever the 
communist party daily rude pravo said in a frontpage editorial 
today 
havel a former dissident who emobdies the democracy movement 
said on the eve of the party congress that the party should become 
a modern political party which would participate as an equal 
among equals in the pluralistic system 
urbanek told prague congress delegates tuesday night that new 
elections to the politburo are not expected but suggested it could 
be replaced by a 21member political executive committee 
among the nonvoting guests at the congress are former party 
members expelled after the soviet invasion of 1968 that crushed the 
prague spring communistled reforms 
there are also 40 delegates from the new reformist communist 
democratic forum a potential splinter group challenging urbaneks 
leadership which submitted a seven point list of demands 
earlier this week the democratic forum spokesman rudolf 
prevratil said the congress will show whether the movment can 
live within the party 
the party was also likely to discuss the presidential elections 
communist premier marian calfa who left for moscow today and was 
therefore not attending the party congress gave an unprecedented 
endorsement to havels candidacy 
the parliaments presidium voted late tuesday to reconvene the 
house dec 29 at the presidential hradcany castle to cast a public 
vote for president havel is essentially the only candidate

let me turn now to task force semper fidelis which is 
essentially a marine rifle company and a light armored infantry 
company marine as well as some additional mps assigned to task 
force semper fidelis 
their principal mission was to secure the bridge of the 
americas insure the security of howard air force base and environs 
around howard air force base task force semper fi has completed 
their mission successfully 
let me turn now to task force red which is off to the west down 
by rio hato for those of you who were here on the third of 
october youll recall that that was the location from which the 
7th company launched their operation to come to the assistance of 
gen noriega during the coup attempt in october 
because of the criticality of that facility as well as two 
companies located there a ranger battalion parachute assaulted 
onto that location at hhour just about 1 am 
all the things im describing so far all took place 
simultaneously about hhour 1 am in the course of their 
activities there they succeeded in neutralizing rio hato it is 
under our control some of the members of the 6th and 7th company 
have dispersed away from rio hato but we also took a number of 
prisoners so it is neutralized and task force red has accomplished 
its mission and is sweeping up in the area 
if i could now turn into the task force bayonet area in the 
central section the narrowest zone there task force bayonet 
consisted of a mechanized battalion the force of the 6th 
mechanized it also was supported by a platoon of light tanks as 
well as the 5th battalion of the 87th infantry 
and the mission of task force bayonet was twofold really to 
provide security for our major facilities in the task force bayonet 
area of operations and the principal combat mission performed by 
the mechanized battalion was to seize the comandancia the 
headquarters of the pdf gen noriegas headquarters and that was 
also done beginning at about one in the morning 
they have accomplished that mission the headquarters has been 
reduced there has been considerable burning im not quite sure 
how much of it has been burned out but there has been quite a bit 
of fire down there but they for the most part most part have 
accomplished their mission 
there is sporadic firing that continues in the area and some of 
the pdf members who were in the comandancia have now slipped out 
and are mixing in with the general population and so there will 
still be a need for mopping up and stability operations in support 
of the new government 
the forces that were opposing them in the vicinity of the 
comandancia are shown under the comandancia listing first public 
order company second public order company and elements of the 
sixth and seventh infantry which i mentioned were out at rio hato 
then we also mentioned that as part of task force bayonet 
another unit was flown across the entrance of the canal in order to 
block the fifth infantry company which is at fort amador and at 
the moment there is continuing work down there to completely 
neutralize the fifth infantry company 
but for the most part task force bayonet has accomplished its 
mission and is undertaking stability and sweepup operations 
let me turn now to the east to task force red task force red 
consisted of another ranger battalion which parachutists assaulted 
in at hhour their mission was to take over the international 
airfield get it ready for followon forces coming from the 82nd 
airborne and begin to block access for battalion 2000 which as 
you know also played an instrumental role in the events of oct 3 
the rangers landed on the ground quickly seized the airport 
began to put out patrols to the east they were assisted and i 
might add that throughout the area of operations the special 
forces group elements belonging to southern command have been 
performing reconnaissance and surveillance and some of those 
reconnaissance and surveillance efforts cut out to the pacora river 
bridge early and blocked that 
here was some fighting out there but no main elements of pdf 
units came down the road in the direction of the city and the 
rangers are now out in that location as well 
beginning 55 minutes after hhour or about 155 this morning 
the first element of the 82 airborne division ready brigade 
arrived 10 c141s and they conducted a parachute assault onto the 
international airfield in that vicinity 
ten c141s arrived several hours later and at 0515 the second 
half of the 82 airborne division parachuted in and their mission 
is sort of depicted by the arrows they will move one arrow going 
out to make sure battalion 2000 stays where it is two other arrows 
coming back into the direction of the city to assist with stability 
operations and make sure the first infantry company and the cavalry 
squadron you see depicted remain neutralized 
in order to continue our stability operations and to make sure 
we really accomplish our mission of protecting americans and 
assisting the newly inaugurated government additional forces are 
being brought down from fort ord calif the 7th infantry 
division a brigade and as i mentioned earlier the 16th mp 
brigade will be sending additional elements down 
in the process of these operations we also took special actions 
to immobilize the pdf navy they have a small fleet of boats which 
were immobilized and we also took actions to immobilize aircraft 
that could have been used for escape purposes 
all of these actions that i have mentioned were marvelously 
supported by air force and army gunships magnificent support from 
the military airlift command tactical air command and refueling 
tankers from the strategic air command special operations units as 
well as special forces reconnaissance and surveillance units 
let me mention a few specific events that i know are of interest 
to you there are reports of hostages we are chasing these 
reports in some cases hostages were taken and then released 
and i dont want to go into any numbers or details because this 
is an ongoing operation except to let you know that we are looking 
into every one of these and we believe we have adequate resources 
in the area to deal with that situation

president bush sensing an opening brought 
about by a series of events last weekend in panama moved to end 
almost two years of frustration by sending in the marines to oust 
gen manuel antonio noreiga from power 
the operation may answer critics who ridiculed the decision to 
stay off to the side during the failed october coup attempt but 
the early hours of fighting showed the attack was fraught with 
military and diplomatic risk 
bushs initial concern is that noriega be found by us forces 
quickly with minimal loss of life and brought to florida for 
trial on drug trafficking charges 
in the early going noriega was elusive and american soldiers 
at least nine of them died some 7000 soldiers and marines were 
sent overnight into panama to bolster the 12000 americans already 
stationed there 
substantial bloodshed could turn political and public opinion 
against the panama operation especially if noriega was to remain 
at large it wasnt clear from the initial reaction whether 
congress or the american public would support an operation that 
involved extensive bloodshed and drags on inconclusively for days 
or even longer 
if the operation seems more like vietnam than grenada bush is 
in trouble 
most of the initial congressional reaction was supportive but 
sen claiborne pell a rhode island democrat and chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee said personally unless very 
clear evidence emerges of a direct threat against the panama canal 
or against american people or installations i would not have 
engaged in such unilateral or such goitalone action without the 
support of other central american nations 
the administration braced for criticism from many in latin 
america given the aversion throughout the hemisphere to us 
unilateral action officials believed some would argue the 
operation was a direct violation of the united nations and 
organization of american states charters both of which stress the 
importance of noninterference in a countrys internal affairs 
in bushs view noriega had to go and nothing else had worked 
the united states had used an impressive array of weapons 
diplomatic economic political against noriega for almost two 
years but he seemed to be able to laugh off everything washington 
tried 
unlike chinese leaders noriega was held in such ill repute that 
he never was a candidate for a wecandobusinesstogether visit 
from national security adviser brent scowcroft 
noriega seemed entrenched surviving repudiation by neighbors 
and growing economic deprivation among his countyrmen he called an 
election then threw out the returns when the results didnt please 
him when rebel officers had him in their clutches last october 
during a coup attempt noriega managed to talk his way out of it 
since february 1988 washington had been saying noriega must 
go but he wouldnt and didnt 
one key question mark is the degree to which president guillermo 
endara is perceived as the legitimate leader of panama 
his strength is that he is seen as the winner of the may 
elections but his burden is that he was sworn in as president an 
hour before the us military operations began in earnest this 
morning 
another potential risk is that the 35000 americans living in 
panama including us servicemen may be the targets of resentment 
or worse from panamanians who believe the invasion was uncalled 
for 
is it possible the outrage among some panamanians will be such 
that acts of sabotage will be carried out against the panama canal 
the irony of todays action is that when the bush administration 
took office there seemed to be a greater disposition to try to 
work in concert with other latin american countries to solve the 
noriega problem 
a usbacked oas mediation effort begun last spring with the 
aim of achieving a democratic transfer of power collapsed in august 
the impetus for direct us action seemed to gain in october 
when bush was widely criticized for not acting more assertively in 
support of the rebel insurrection against noriega 
if bush was looking for an excuse to act a series of events 
starting last friday gave him his opening one was a panamanian 
government declaration of a state of war with the united states 
another contributing factor was the tense situation which 
ensued marked by the death of one us serviceman and the 
harassment of a us navy couple in both cases members of the 
panamanian military were involved 
bush had had enough and the stage was set for the most 
controversial decision of the bush presidency

gen manuel antonio noriegas capture would enable us 
authorities to bring him to trial on drug trafficking charges 
brought against him in miami and tampa fla 
the indictments against the panamanian leader were unsealed feb 
5 1988 and marked the first time federal charges were filed 
against a foreign leader who was not in the united states 
fifteen other people also face charges in the case 
noriega could receive up to 145 years in prison and more than 
11 million in fines if convicted

the soviet union today swiftly condemned the us 
military assault to seize panamanian leader manuel antonio noriega 
while british prime minister margaret thatcher praised it as a 
courageous decision 
someone has to uphold democracy mrs thatcher said 
reactions contrasted sharply as news flashed around the world 
that president bush had ordered troops to capture gen noriega who 
was indicted on cocaine trafficking charges in the united states in 
1988 
among other western allies dutch foreign minister han van den 
broek said in a radio interview that he sympathized partly because 
us troops had been endangered recently in the panama canal zone 
tensions had been rising in panama between us and panamanian 
forces after panamanians killed a us marine lieutenant on 
saturday in what american officials called an unprovoked attack 
foreign ministers of argentina brazil mexico uruguay peru 
venezuela and colombia conferred by telephone on the situation 
then agreed to meet in bogota tonight to discuss the developments 
in panama and issue a declaration the colombian foreign ministry 
announced 
panama was part of the so called latin american group of eight 
but was excluded after noriega ousted panamanian president eric 
delvalle in 1988 
the group has condemned noriegas regime but it has also 
advanced a consistent rejection of any direct intervention of the 
us in panama 
canada expressed regret today about the use of force by the 
united states in panama but was sympathetic to the american action 
under the circumstances 
a statement from external affairs minister joe clark also said 
that intervention by force is a dangerous precedent adding 
that canada notes that the united states relied on force as a last 
resort after failing to resolve the situation in panama peacefully 
foreign minister francisco fernandez ordonez of spain said he 
deeply lamented the us action he said the spanish 
government which always has been opposed to foreign military 
intervention expresses its hope that the panamanian people can 
decide their future in freedom 
foreign minister taro nakayama of japan said he hoped the 
confrontation would end soon 
japan has long been expressing its hope to see a democratic 
government established in panama that reflects the will of the 
panamanian people the kyodo news service quoted nakayama as 
telling japanese reporters we hope this takes place as soon as 
possible 
in moscow foreign ministry spokesman vadim p perfiliev said 
these actions a violation of the un charter and generally 
recognized rules of state relations should be condemned by the 
international community the united states must immediately stop 
its armed intervention in panama 
perfiliev quoted by the official tass news agency said the 
us action whatever its motivation has provoked a feeling of 
serious concern in the soviet union 
staterun radio moscow accused the united states of invading 
panama in what in called an act of aggression 
yugoslavia also said the us action was unacceptable 
yugoslavia has always considered as unacceptable any foreign 
and especially a military intervention under any excuse as it 
represents a crude violation of sovereignty a yugoslav foreign 
ministry statement said 
mrs thatcher spoke to reporters on the steps of her 10 downing 
street office after bush telephoned at 7 am 2 am est to tell 
her the military assault was under way they spoke for 10 minutes 
i said we would fully support him in the action he was taking 
to bring an end to this rule of terror mrs thatcher said i 
believe he was right to do so i believe this is what friends are 
for to give support at this time it was a courageous decision 
mrs thatcher called on other world leaders to declare support 
for bush saying every action has a risk and it is important 
that it be successful 
gen noriega is wanted on drugs allegations in the united 
states we are fighting terror and the battle against drugs as 
well the rule of democracy should be upheld she added 
mrs thatchers warm response contrasted with her sharp 
criticism of the usled invasion of grenada in 1983 to topple a 
leftist administration in the caribbean island grenada is a former 
british colony that regards britains queen elizabeth ii as its 
titular head of state 
britains opposition labor party criticized the us action 
saying it had nothing to do with democracy in panama and 
everything to do with protecting the american interests in the 
canal zone

with respect to general noriega as you know were only seven 
hours into this operation we have not yet located the general he 
has a habit of changing locations in normal times four or five 
times a night 
but we will continue our efforts to locate him but as a 
practical matter we have decapitated him from the dictatorship of 
this country and he is now a fugitive and will be treated as such 
with respect to the embassy the american embassy did take some 
fire in the course of the evening nobody was injured there was 
some minor damage to the embassy and we have us forces in strength 
at the embassy to secure it 
as you know there is a new government in place and i will talk 
briefly about the casualty figures as you know this is 
preliminary and i want to reemphasize that the numbers im about 
to give you are preliminary and are subject to change as we move in 
the course of the morning and get better information 
at the moment the figures i have from the southern command 
provide the information that nine americans were killed in action 
thirtynine americans were wounded in action one american is 
missing 
several aircraft were damaged they include several c130s and 
some helicopters and i have no information that im comfortable 
with pdf casualties to provide at this time 
that concludes my briefing 
 
q gen powell do you see the need to send further 
reinforcements or are we seeing all of the forces that are going to 
be necessary 
powell the forces i mentioned that are being sent in now for 
reinforcement the seventh division and the mps i think thatll do 
it i think thatll bring it up to around 24000 and thats really 
not for sustained combat but for stability operations to make sure 
that we are truly controlling the situation 
q 240000 youre sending in or does that include 
powell no thats total including those that were there to 
begin with 
q so that includes the ones that are in now gen powell 
powell yes total 
q or the ones that will be in 
powell that includes all that we are planning including those 
that are in the reinforcement package coming and that is as you 
know a number that can float around as we adjust our plans in the 
course of the day 
q how many have been sent in so far 
powell there were 13000 to begin with 
cheney who were already there 
powell who were already there as part of southern command 
assets before the operation began overnight and so far we have 
introduced close to another 7000 and we have roughly 2500 i 
believe on the way from the seventh division and the 16th mp 
brigade 
q gen powell what about members of the 82nd airborne and some 
of the army rangers who were brought in i know you say you want to 
get them out as quickly as possible when can we expect that they 
will be sent home 
powell well the primary mission right now is to make sure the 
situation is under control and we have satisfied our objectives and 
then as soon as that is as we would like it to be and were sure 
that things are settled down we will start to retrograde those 
soldiers as quickly as possible but i dont have a specific 
timeline yet 
q gen powell do you have any evidence that noriega was 
about to threaten the operations of the canal 
powell i have heard those reports he has been saying this for 
years and years so those reports would not surprise me but i dont 
know that i want to get into specific reports 
q inaudible 
powell nothing that came to my attention that caused me great 
concern we had deployed our forces in a way that provided i 
believe adequate protection of the canal 
q gen powell can you tell us where president endara was sworn 
in who did it i mean tell us a little bit about that scenario 
can you 
powell he was sworn in shortly before the operation i dont 
have the details and i think id better i need to refer you to 
the state department for those kinds of answers it was a 
panamanian he was sworn in by a panamanian justice of some kind 
and it was done an hour before but with respect to 
q at an american base 
powell yes but i really need to refer you to state department 
because it was handled by the state department 
q gen powell what assurances do you have that noriega isnt 
going to escape into the countryside and organize some kind of 
guerrilla operations to keep harassing us forces down there 
powell oh he can do that and we will chase them and we will 
find him 
q do you know that hes still in the country 
powell no i dont know that we he is a very canny 
individual hes demonstrated incredible ability to survive 
catastrophe and well see over time whether he survives this 
catastrophe 
q general now wouldnt he make life miserable for the us 
forces down there 
powell i doubt it no i dont think one its been some years 
since general mr noriega the fugitive has been seen in the 
jungle living in the jungle hes used to a different kind of 
lifestyle and im not quite sure he would be up to being chased 
around the countryside by army rangers special forces and light 
infantry units of the joint operations training center but you 
might i cant rule that out but i think thats rather far 
fetched

lithuanian communists overwhelmingly 
approved a resolution today calling for an end to their 
subordination to the soviet communist party 
a final vote on formally establishing a fully independent 
lithuanian communist party was delayed by several hours of debate 
on procedural questions 
by a vote of 838142 the lithuanian communist party congress 
meeting in the capital vilnius approved a resolution calling for 
relations of equal partnership with the soviet communist party 
other progressive parties public organizations and movements 
lithuanian communists who supported a legislative move dec 7 
to strike the leading role of the party from the baltic republics 
constitution are spurred by the need to compete with the 
grassroots political movement sajudis and other newly formed 
parties in local elections feb 24 
president mikhail s gorbachev general secretary of the soviet 
communist party has appealed to lithuanian communists not to break 
away saying a split will damage his reform efforts 
a formal break would run counter to more than 80 years of 
communist party practice and policy since before the 1917 russian 
revolution vladimir i lenin demanded a unified party covering the 
entire territory of the czarist empire in 1921 the party outlawed 
the existence of factions 
sajudis observers say local communist parties in other republics 
such as latvia estonia georgia and armenia could follow 
lithuanias example soon and present gorbachev with a splintered 
party when he convenes the 28th national party congress in the fall 
delegates also approved on a vote of 850139 a separate 
declaration saying lithuanias communist partys relations with the 
national party must be based on mutual understanding 
restructuring of the soviet communist party and the results of the 
28th soviet party congress

q well when you went into grenada you had we had support 
right at the outset the people were brought in to say they 
supported this action but here youre not able to say that at 
this point 
cheney well this was a different situation 
q why 
cheney i mean theres always a tendency to want to compare 
this operation with the last operation and obviously both are 
military operations but in the case of grenada there were no us 
forces present on the island we were invited by the governments of 
the eastern caribbean to come in and provide support in the case 
of panama there is a major us presence there we are in panama 
with significant military force because we have a right to be under 
the panama canal treaties its just a different set of 
circumstances in this case the president felt very strongly and 
this was the basic justification for undertaking the operation 
that it was necessary in order to safeguard american lives and at 
the same time to restore democracy to panama 
q will this hurt us though with other central american 
countries once again uncle sam imposing his will 
cheney well i would hope not i would hope that other central 
american countries would recognize that what we have done is to 
participate in the removal of a drug trafficker a man who was a 
dictator a selfdescribed maximum leader of panama a man who had 
brutally treated not only americans but also panamanian citizens a 
man who had annulled the last election and defied the will of the 
people of panama to be governed by mr endara and that our action 
is justified and will produce a democratic government in panama i 
think thats a the way for it to be viewed and i would hope that 
other governments in the hemisphere recognize the reasons why the 
president took the action and the result that will come from it 
q mr secretary following the failed coup in panama you came 
into this room and you made a number of arguments justifying our 
decision not to get more heavily involved you pointed to the risk 
of inserting american forces in panama city and you said it wasnt 
up to the united states i think as you put it to the 
willynilly around the world knocking off governments this was 
something the panamanians would have to do for themselves why is 
your earlier assessment which you made in this room two months ago 
not valid anymore 
cheney no i am not sure id agree with your assessment of my 
earlier assessment but i think that there were significant changes 
as a result of the actions of the past week and that what was 
different was that on saturday for example an unarmed american 
officer was shot and killed by the pdf that this came about after 
gen noriega had had himself declared maximum leader and then 
indicated that a state of war existed between panama and the 
government of the united states i think we as a government bent 
over backwards to avoid having to take military action i think the 
record is replete with the patience and forbearance of the united 
states government in this instance when it reached the point 
however when it was clear that american lives were at risk when 
it reached the point where it was clear that gen noriega had 
created an environment in which his troops felt free to terrorize 
and brutalize americans who had every legitimate and lawful right 
to be in panama that was a fundamentally different set of 
circumstances 
q mr secretary what sort of threat do the dignity 
battalions now pose for these operations 
cheney id defer to the general on that 
powell well were watching them carefully its not clear 
its not clear how many of them are real battalions and how many 
are just thugs and rabble rousers that would simply melt away they 
have not caused us any difficulty yet but they have the potential 
of sniping and things like that 
q isnt the fact that there are so many there are 23000 us 
citizens in panama some dependents some of military personnel 
living there there do you think this is a particularly dangerous 
operation and what was done to protect them

investigators looking into what happened to 1 
million paid out of a police department undercover operations fund 
said important documents on a former deputy chief suspected of 
stealing from the account have vanished 
the missing documents detail kenneth weiners involvement with 
the fund executive deputy chief james bannon said tuesday 
hes gone the records are gone he was last known to be 
the custodian of most of the documents bannon said 
police chief william hart has said weiner a former civilian 
deputy police chief stole from the fund which finances undercover 
operations of the narcotics division 
weiner was in charge of sensitive security work for the police 
from 1980 to 1986 he resigned in 1986 after an investigation into 
a preciousmetals investments deal in which several detroitarea 
investors lost several thousand dollars 
weiner has not been seen or heard from publicly since the 
federal and city investigations began several weeks ago the fbi 
has refused to discuss the scope or any other details of its 
investigation into the fund 
the fbi and us attorneys office are trying to determine 
whether weiner diverted hundreds of thousands of dollars from the 
fund for personal use 
bannon said a substantial number of documents were gone 
including some subpoenaed under federal and city orders he said a 
theft report was filed 
the city council subpoenaed financial records from 1985 to 1987 
and city auditors began examining documents tuesday 
release of the records averted a court battle between mayor 
coleman young and the council which had issued a subpoena 
demanding a chance to review the records 
the mayors concern all along was to protect the integrity of 
the grand jury process and the integrity of the secret service 
fund said spokesman bob berg 
young who initially said he never would give the documents to 
city auditors and the council refused to say why he changed his 
mind

a lawyer for gen manuel antonio noriega said today 
the panamanian leader would die rather than surrender to us 
forces sent to bring him to this country to face drug charges 
panamanian exiles here celebrated the us attack 
noriega was indicted on federal drug charges in miami and in 
tampa in 1988 attorney raymond takiff said he talked with the 
general monday evening 
we discussed various things including this very real 
possibility of us military action the miami lawyer said in a 
telephone interview 
the attorney said he had planned to fly to panama city this 
evening to meet with noriega this morning he spoke with members 
of the generals staff who didnt know his whereabouts 
hes a fighter takiff said i feel unhappily secure in my 
belief that he will be killed he will not be captured should that 
occur the truth will never come out 
takiff questioned news accounts that noriega had declared war on 
the united states which he described as just some more 
propaganda thats come across again out of context 
us district judge william m hoeveler assigned as the trial 
judge in the miami indictment said today if general noriega is 
apprehended and brought here for trial he would be given the same 
treatment as any other person accused of a crime no more no 
less all his rights will be protected 
also closely following events were members of miamis panamanian 
exile community including luis endara cousin of guillermo endara 
who won the countrys may election but was blocked by noriega from 
taking power guillermo endara declared himself president shortly 
after the us military action began 
i can assure you 9999 percent of all panamanians are up i 
know of at least five parties going on in miami luis endara 
said in an earlymorning telephone interview 
he added that he had been in telephone contact with panama 
many of the oppositions key people have taken refuge in safe 
places since we had reports way back from before the elections of 
may that the dignity brigades armed citizens who support noriega 
had lists of key opposition people to attack should something like 
this happen he said 
convinced the military action would be a success luis endara 
predicted many panamanians living in this country would return to 
their homeland afterward 
exiles will probably return to panama once everything is back 
to normality he said we will probably see for the first time 
an emigration back to a country that has been liberated 
another panamanian in miami said that if noriega is captured he 
will have to face all the things that he has done to the 
panamanian people 
i think he owes to the panamanians many things and this is the 
first thing we have to face said aurelio barria founder of the 
national civic crusade in panama we would like to find the truth 
of all the cases pending and try him in panama

cheney well i think a key part of the plan that gen powell 
may want to address was to wrap up the pdf as quickly as possible 
if you will and to provide security for the americans living in 
the area we reached the judgment that in the long run americans 
were going to be more secure that their safety was likely to be 
greater the risk likely to be reduced if we acted now rather than 
if we waited and let the situation continue to spiral out of 
control 
q mr cheney do you think there will be additional 
casualties as the mopping up continues 
cheney i dont have any way to know that i dont have any way 
to know 
q what are the last pockets of resistance can you run over 
that colin and tell us 
powell oh there is a little bit at the comandancia just some 
sniping coming out and we still have a slight problem down on fort 
amador area with the 5th infantry company but thats pretty much 
it theres a little bit of firing out by the pacora river bridge 
but its really not 
q the mo has basically been for resistance and then they sort 
of break up and fade off into the neighborhoods is that 
powell thats what we have seen 
q how do you deal with that in the days or hours ahead here 
if you have a lot of armed people who at least formerly were 
pronoriega 
powell what we have to find out is whether or not they are an 
armed resistance force or just individuals who now are just 
criminals and thugs running around the countryside well just have 
to wait and see how it plays out 
q do you have large numbers of pdf now willing to work with 
you have you begun the liaison 
powell well still sorting out the pieces we have a fairly 
significant number of detainees ill call them for the moment and 
well sort that over time sort that out over time youve just 
got to bear with us were only a few hours into this 
q gen powell youve said several times that noriega mr 
noriega personally is a fugitive yet panamanian broadcasts suggest 
that hes still running the show militarily what have you got to 
indicate that he is in fact a fugitive on the run 
powell because he is a fugitive were looking for him hes 
not running anything because we own all of the bases he owned 
eight hours ago 
q how convinced are you that you will get noriega and will you 
call this operation a success if you dont 
powell im not a fortune teller as to whether we will get him 
or when we will get him i think the operation is a success already 
because we cut off the head of that government and there is a new 
government that was elected by the panamanian people waiting 
willing and ready to take over and i hope thats what will happen 
i hope what we will do is assist them in standing up and taking 
over and i think the people of panama will rally to this 
government 
q general would you say that the operation has lasted more 
than what you expected did you intend it to be a more a surgical 
strike or do you think 
powell i had no set timelines in mind i really wasnt sure it 
could have been over quickly it could linger for days or weeks i 
just dont know and id just be wildly speculating with you at 
this time ill know better later in the day i think 
q does that mean the operation the operation isnt over and 
we need to get inaudible 
q have we communicated with the soviet union and did they 
protest 
cheney ill direct you to the state department 
q thank you all very much 
powell could i just say that i hope you recognize how 
complicated an operation this was and how competently it was 
carried out by the armed force of the united states we all the 
secretary and i all of our associates deeply regret the loss of 
american life but thats sometimes necessary in pursuit of our 
national interests and in the fight for democracy 
thank you

john bushnell the highestranking 
us official in panama said today that there will be fear among 
panamanians until gen manuel noriega is captured or otherwise 
removed from the scene 
having him loose does raise the potential that he might raise 
more mischief said bushnell the us charge daffaires i 
have the concern that until he is in custody there is still going 
to be a great deal of concern and fear among the panamanians 
bushnell made his comments to a group of reporters at a heavily 
guarded fort on the outskirts of the city 
noriega may take to the hills and be very hard to find 
but he wouldnt have a significant force to actually do 
anything bushnell said he will get very little support from 
the people 
the news group from washington was shuttled to the fort by 
helicopter from howard air force base only 10000 yards from where 
the briefing was held because the military considered it unsafe to 
drive 
the reporters were given six copies of a videotape of the 
swearingin of panamas newly elected leadership 
the officials themselves were in hiding because it was still too 
risky for them to appear anywhere in public bushnell said he 
would not disclose their whereabouts 
the three panamanian leaders considered by the united states 
to have won an election last may met with bushnell on monday 
evening and were told of the us military plan they approved of 
it in a letter to president bush bushnell said 
the officials president guillermo endara and vice presidents 
ricardo arias calderon and guillermo ford were sworn in at an 
undisclosed site early wednesday as the military action was getting 
under way 
the oath was witnessed by two officials of panamas human rights 
association because no panamanian government official could be 
enlisted to participate 
bushnell raised the possibility that noriega could slip into 
nicaragua or cuba he may be in the embassies right now 
hiding he said 
the us embassy was hit by one or possibly two rounds believed 
from a rocketpropelled grenade launcher in wednesdays fighting 
the new panamanian government was hoping to go soon to the 
presidential house once the fighting is over the leaders were 
welcoming us help they had eschewed earlier because of the 
experience and aftermath of the oct 3 coup attempt against noriega 
there werent too many panamanians left with guns who were 
willing to do it bushnell said when noriega is captured 
there will be an immense sigh of relief

the leftist sandinista government put 
its armed forces on maximum alert today mobilized troops and tanks 
and called the us invasion of panama a serious threat to 
nicaragua 
large howitzers were set up in the center of downtown managua 
and red beret special forces in camouflage uniforms were posted at 
the international airport 
president daniel orgega declared a state of national alert 
and asked for an urgent meeting of the un security council in 
new york the security council agreed to meet in emergency session 
today 
ortega also sent messages to the nonaligned movement and pope 
john paul ii saying he was deeply concerned by the invasion of 
panama 
in addition to constituting a flagrant trampling of the 
sovereignty and territorial integrity of panama it is a threat to 
the peace and security of all latin america central america and 
especially constitutes a serious threat to nicaragua ortega said 
in a communique read on voice of nicaragua radio 
the army was put on a state of combative general alert the 
communique said that implied immediate deployment of land sea and 
air combat units reserves and civilian militia also were called up

here is the text of president bushs address 
to the nation wednesday on us military action in panama 
 
fellow citizens last night i ordered us military forces to 
panama no president takes such action lightly this morning i 
want to tell you what i did and why i did it 
for nearly two years the united states nations of latin 
america and the caribbean have worked together to resolve the 
crisis in panama the goals of the united states have been to 
safeguard the lives of americans to defend democracy in panama to 
combat drug trafficking and to protect the integrity of the panama 
canal treaty 
many attempts have been made to resolve this crisis through 
diplomacy and negotiations all were rejected by the dictator of 
panama general manuel noriega an indicted drug trafficker 
last friday noriega declared his military dictatorship to be in 
a state of war with the united states and publicly threatened the 
lives of americans in panama the very next day forces under his 
command shot and killed an unarmed american serviceman wounded 
another arrested and brutally beat a third american serviceman and 
then brutally interrogated his wife threatening her with sexual 
abuse that was enough 
general noriegas reckless threats and attacks upon americans in 
panama created an immminent danger to the 35000 american citizens 
in panama as president i have no higher obligation than to 
safeguard the lives of american citizens and that is why i 
directed our armed forces to protect the lives of american citizens 
in panama and to bring general noriega to justice in the united 
states 
i contacted the bipartisan leadership of congress last night and 
informed them of this decision and after taking this action i 
also talked with leaders in latin america the caribbean and those 
of other us allies 
at this moment us forces including forces deployed from the 
united states last night are engaged in action in panama the 
united states intends to withdraw the forces newly deployed to 
panama as quickly as possible 
all forces have conducted themselves courageously and 
selflessly and as commanderinchief i salute every one of them 
and thank them on behalf of our country 
tragically some americans have lost their lives in defense of 
their fellow citizens in defense of democracy and my heart goes 
out to their families we also regret and mourn the loss of 
innocent panamanians 
the brave panamanians elected by the people of panama in the 
elections last may president guillermo endara and vice presidents 
calderon and ford have assumed the rightful leadership of their 
country 
you remember those horrible pictures of newlyelected vice 
president ford covered head to toe with blood beaten mercilessly 
by socalled dignity battalions 
well the united states today recognizes the democratically 
elected government of president endara i will send our ambassador 
back to panama immediately 
key military objectives have been achieved most organized 
resistance has been eliminated but the operation is not over yet 
general noriega is in hiding and nevertheless yesterday a 
dictator ruled panama and today constitutionallyelected govern 
elected leaders govern 
i have today directed the secretary of the treasury and the 
secretary of state to lift the economic sanctions with respect to 
the democratically elected government of panama and in cooperation 
with that government to take steps to effect an orderly unblocking 
of panamanian government assets in the united states 
i am fully committed to implement the panama canal treaties and 
turn over the canal to panama in the year 2000 the actions we have 
taken and the cooperation of a new democratic government in pamana 
will permit us to honor these commitments 
as soon as the new government recommends a qualified candidate 
panamanian to be administrator of the canal as called for in the 
treaties i will submit this nominee to the senate for expedited 
consideration 
i am committed to strengthening our relationship with the 
democratic nations in this hemisphere i will continue to seek 
solutions to the problems of this region through dialogue and 
multilateral diplomacy 
i took this action only after reaching the conclusion that every 
other avenue was closed and the lives of american citizens were in 
grave danger 
i hope that the people of panama will put this dark chapter of 
dictatorship behind them and move forward together as citizens of a 
democratic panama with this government that they themselves have 
elected 
the united states is eager to work with the panamanian people in 
partnership and friendship to rebuild their economy the panamanian 
people want democracy peace and the chance for a better life in 
dignity and freedom the people of the united states seek only to 
support them in pursuit of these noble goals 
thank you very much

chancellor helmut kohl of west 
germany tried to reassure opponents of german reunification today 
and said their fears of an evil german empire based on past horrors 
are absurd 
kohl during a news conference closing a triumphant twoday 
visit also said he expects a treaty expanding east and west german 
ties to be completed by may 
kohl met with communist premier hans modrow on tuesday and the 
two later announced plans for the treaty and a number of other 
changes 
the famed brandenburg gate isolated in east berlin since the 
berlin wall was built in 1961 will be reopened by christmas 
germans will be allowed to travel without visas between the two 
states beginning christmas eve 
east germany will free all political prisoners with many to be 
released before christmas 
kohl pledged to take into account the concerns of other european 
countries as the two german states created after world war ii 
move closer together 
its the most natural thing that germans want to live 
together kohl said 
kohl pledged to avoid destabilization a reference to the 
power vacuum in east germany that has followed the virtual collapse 
of communist party control here since a popular revolution began in 
the fall 
kohl added fears based in the past are understandable but 
there is nothing to be feared from the future its absurd to talk 
about a fourth reich 
east german communists and other opponents of reunification have 
said joining the two states could create a fourth reich and 
have reminded people of the atrocities of nazi dictator adolf 
hitlers third reich 
in meeting with several opposition groups including new forum 
democratic awakening and others kohl said he heard none of them 
voice opposition to eventual reunification 
new forum representative arnold vaatz told the official news 
agency adn he found broad agreement with kohl and that his 
group was thankful for the results of the summit 
earlier today kohl met with the roman catholic bishops of 
dresden and berlin joachim reinelt and georg sterzinsky 
sterzinsky said he and reinelt explained their views on future 
cooperation with west germany in the meeting with kohl 
sterzinsky said he expects west germany to treat us as a 
partner and help with our renewal he viewed the visit by kohl a 
conservative christian democrat as entirely positive the 
official news agency adn reported 
west germanys bild newspaper quoted unidentified officials in 
dresden as saying berlins brandenburg gate will be open to 
pedestrians friday the newspaper said its report would appear in 
thursdays editions it was sent in advance to other news media 
today 
the brandenburg gate is a symbol of german unity to millions and 
was a centerpiece of a major berlin thoroughfare before the wall 
was built 28 years ago 
under the pressure of massive prodemocracy demonstrations 
starting in october openings have been made in the wall two sets 
of communist leaders have been ousted and free elections are 
scheduled in may at the same time west germany has warmly 
accepted all east german refugees and offered to help revive its 
neighbors struggling economy 
at a joint news conference after their summit kohl and modrow 
said their talks had made progress toward what the two nations 
refer to as a treaty community such an arrangement would 
safeguard the sovereignty of both states 
talks leading up to the planned bilateral treaty could focus on 
improving traffic connections telecommunications and pollution 
problems kohl said 
both leaders agreed to meet again in late january or early 
february in west germany 
while kohl stressed the right of selfdetermination for 
citizens in both germany on the issue of reunification modrow 
called for the continued existence of two german states 
kohl joined his host in counseling caution and patience 
later kohl received an emotional welcome from a crowd of about 
20000 at an outdoor evening rally 
people repeatedly burst into wild cheers applause and chants of 
unity unity as kohl addressed them as his countrymen 
many waved west german flags outnumbering those carrying signs 
insisting on east german sovereignty or attacking kohl

president bush told the american people today 
that he sent american forces into a surprise overnight assault in 
panama to end a dark chapter of dictatorship by manuel antonio 
noriega and forestall a grave danger to the 35000 americans 
living there 
bush ordered american forces to apprehend noriega so he could be 
put on trial in the united states on charges of drug trafficking 
but he acknowledged that noreiga remained at large 
we will chase him and we will find him vowed the nations 
top military officer gen colin powell he said reinforcements 
flown to panama and those on the way would bring the us force 
there to 24000 
powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said nine 
americans were killed in action 39 were wounded and one was 
missing he said he did not know how many panamanians had died 
the pentagon codenamed the mission operation just cause 
in a nationally televised oval office speech at 720 am est a 
somber bush said i took this action only after reaching the 
conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of 
american citizens were in grave danger bush said 
the white house said the decision had been reached sunday after 
an american marine officer was shot and killed outside noriegas 
military headquarters 
bush offered this explanation 
general noriegas reckless threats and attacks upon americans 
in panama created an imminent danger to the 35000 american 
citizens in panama as president i have no higher obligation than 
to safeguard the lives of american citizens and that is why i 
directed our armed forces to protect the lives of american citizens 
in panama and to bring general noriega to justice in the united 
states 
but while key military objectives had been achieved and most 
organized resistance eliminated bush said the operation is not 
over yet gen noriega is in hiding 
nevertheless yesterday a dictator ruled panama and today 
constitutionally elected leaders govern the president said 
one intelligence source on capitol hill said there had been 
reports in recent months of a deterioration in noriegas mental 
state including increased paranoia and constant drinking but the 
source cautioned that the reports were not based on hard evidence 
and he discounted their importance as a factor in the launching of 
todays military action 
us officials noted that leaders of a failed coup attempt last 
october had said noriega had been drinking heavily and powell said 
he had heard reports that noriega had been threatening operations 
of the canal 
after his speech bush signed an order lifting us economic 
sanctions against panama and directing an orderly unblocking of 
panamanian government assets in the united states 
separately bush issued a memo to the pentagon specifically 
authorizing us forces to apprehend noriega and any other 
persons in panama currently under indictment in the united states 
for drugrelated offenses and to turn them over to us law 
enforcement officials 
however his declaration that noriega had so far eludd the grasp 
of american forces left the overall success of the military mission 
in question 
bush said guillermo endara who won last mays election in 
results that noriega refused to accept was hastily sworn in as 
president of panama and he said he was committed to implement the 
panama canal treaties and surrender control of the canal to panama 
in the year 2000 
bushs swift action stood in contrast to his inaction last 
october when he kept us forces on the sidelines while some 
panamanian generals sought to oust noriega in a coup bush drew 
heavy congressional criticism at that time 
as evidence bush noted that noriega last week declared his 
military dictatorship to be in a state of war with the united 
states he also recited a series of events in panama over the 
past few days including the fatal shooting of an american military 
officer 
tragically some americans have lost their lives in defense of 
their fellow citizens in defense of democracy the president 
said he expressed his condolences to their families and said he 
regretted that some innocent panamanians also had been killed 
bush said the forces flown overnight to panama would be 
withdrawn as quickly as possible powell said nearly 7000 
additional soliders and paratroopers had arrived from stateside 
bases and 2500 were en route this morning to supplement those 
troops based in panama 
bush said he informed congressional leaders and us allies 
about his decision 
sen jesse helm rnc predicted the majority of the senate 
will feel good by this turn of events senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine said bushs action was made necessary 
by the reckless actions of gen noriega 
but sen claiborne pell chairman of the senate foreign 
relations committee said i would not have engaged in such 
unilateral or such goitalone action without the support of 
other central american nations 
at an emergency meeting of the organization of american states 
called at the request of noriegas envoy endara issued a statement 
asking the organization to recognize lawrence chewning fabrega as 
its ambassador to the oas the statement was faxed to the oas from 
the us army south headquarters in panama according to the 
signoff 
noriegas representative jose maria cabrera stayed in the 
chair designated for his country i am the representative of the 
republic of panama and i denounce this criminal aggression he 
told a reporter 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the administration 
sent a cable to soviet officials informing them of the action the 
soviets swiftly condemned the move as a violation of the united 
nations charter 
bush said the united states had tried repeatedly but 
unsuccessfully to use diplomacy and negotiation to remove noriega 
and that it was now recognizing the democratically elected 
government 
the president spoke after only a few hours of sleep he had 
stayed in the oval office until a few minutes after 4 am to 
monitor developments in panama and was in time for his speech that 
began shortly after 7 am 
vice president dan quayle secretary of state james a baker iii 
and other top aides also were at the white house for much of the 
night 
defense secretary dick cheney and powell were in the pentagons 
military command center 
beginning with bush the administration did what it could to 
preserve secrecy of the operation before fitzwaters dramatic 
announcement about the military action the president hosted a 
white house christmas party attended by reporters but gave no hint 
of the impending action 
us military intervention in central america is a tradition of 
long standing including president reagans decision to invade 
grenada in 1983 and overthrow a leftist government 
bush had hinted at military action earlier in the week when he 
told interviewers i think a president all presidents have 
options but they dont discuss what they might be 
first reagan and then bush have been trying to force noriegas 
ouster since 1988 when the panamanian leader was indicted in this 
country on federal drug trafficking charges the united states 
imposed stiff economic sanctions against panama in hopes of 
dislodging him from power 
the situation in panama had been jumpy for days tuesday 
afternoon the pentagon spokesman said a us soldier used an 
unauthorized weapon when he shot a panamanian police officer 
monday he called the incident very regrettable but said it had 
to be considered in the context of a deteriorating situation

atampt bell laboratories says it has 
developed an integrated circuit that can turn a computer chips 
singlelane processing of information into a busy freeway 
the photonic integrated circuit opens the way to vastly more 
powerful computers the company said tuesday 
it will enable scientists to build optical computer systems 
which would use light pulses as well as electricity to transmit 
information atampt said from its solid state technology center near 
allentown 
the results may be very important to everyone once they start 
happening within a few year to a decade said leo chirovsky a 
research scientist at bell labs in murray hill nj he cited 
weather forecasting as a possible application 
the device has 2048 elements each of which can switch on or 
off in less than onebillionth of a second when illuminated by a 
lowpower light beam 
if one thinks of a computer chip as a city computers until now 
have been designed on the premise that information comes in and 
goes out on narrow roads chirovsky said 
this is the equivalent of providing a huge multilane highway 
on a chip that will promote a whole new way of looking at 
computing he said

defense secretary dick cheney said today that 
plans for a us military invasion of panama carried out today in 
the predawn operation just cause had been in the works since 
before he took office last spring 
cheney and other administration officials called the 1 am est 
invasion a success even though its initial attempts to capture 
panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega had failed 
the pentagon on president bushs orders sent 7000 
paratroopers and other soldiers from us bases to panama in a bid 
to oust noriega and bring him to this country to face 
drugtrafficking charges 
nine american servicemen were killed 39 injured and one 
reported missing in the operation which pulled together more than 
20000 us infantrymen paratroopers marines airmen and sailors 
i think this operation was a success already because we cut 
off the head of that government and there is a new government that 
was elected by the panamanian people waiting willing and ready to 
take over said gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff 
he added that he believed the people of panama will rally to 
support the new leaders installed under us auspices 
we have not located the general but as a practical matter he 
is a fugitive and will be treated as such powell told reporters 
at the pentagon this reign of terror is over 
cheney said the order went out late on sunday to implement a 
plan that had been in existence for some time it was one of the 
first items i was briefed on when i became secretary of defense 
last spring 
we hope to be wrapping up general noreiga in the future 
cheney said as the president has said we have achieved the bulk 
of our objective 
powell the nations top military officer said sporadic sniping 
continued from noriegas former headquarters and that there was a 
slight problem near fort amador where the panamanian 5th infantry 
was located most of the remaining action consisted of putting down 
the remaining forces loyal to noriega 
were into mopping up and chasing down those who have not 
yet decided to give it up the general said 
powell said the us forces were determining whether the firing 
was coming from an armed resistance force or just individuals 
who are now just criminals and thugs running around the 
countryside 
in a nationally broadcast address from the white house shortly 
before the pentagon briefing president bush said he had ordered 
the invasion to protect american lives and install an elected 
government in place of noriega who faces drugtrafficking 
indictments in the united states 
powell said 7000 troops had been sent from the united states 
overnight to augment the 13000 us troops based near the panama 
canal and that 2500 more were arriving later in the day some 
forces parachuted into action 
the general said the invasion dubbed operation just cause 
simultaneously used airborne rangers paratroopers infantrymen 
marines and light tank units to attack the central headquarters of 
the panamanian defense forces as well as several other military 
bases and airports 
the bulk of the forces came from the 82nd airborne division from 
fort bragg nc and the 7th light infantry division from fort 
ord calif 
they were transported in south by huge air force c141 transport 
planes which had been landing in panama throughout the night 
powell said the us forces encountered opposition from local 
forces throughout the area of operations but that the invasion 
went smoothly 
i hope you recognize how complicated an operation this was and 
how competently it was carried out he told reporters 
asked whether noriega would become a fugitive leader of 
rebellious troops that would harass us forces powell said 
he can do that and we will chase him and we will find him he 
is a very canny individual hes demonstrated incredible ability to 
survive catastrophe and well see over time whether he survives 
this catastrophe 
its been some years since general mister noriega the 
fugitive has been seen in the jungle hes used to a different 
kind of lifestyle im not quite sure he would be up to being 
chased around the countryside by army rangers special forces and 
light infantry units powell said 
the general said the american deaths came as a result of 
firefighting but could offer no further detail he said us 
officials deeply regret the loss of american life 
powell said he did not have a reliable number for the number of 
panamanian troops killed in the overnight invasion he said that in 
addition to the american casualties some us cargo planes and 
helicopters were damaged 
the general said there had been reports that some american 
civilians had been taken hostage and that us forces were looking 
into each incident but that he had no numbers or details to 
provide about them 
powell detailed the parachute drops and assaults that resulted 
in american forces occupying all the bases that had been manned 
by the panamanian military 
cheney and powell met with reporters after a nightlong vigil in 
the pentagon

a team of fbi and drug enforcement 
administration agents was dispatched to panama today to help 
american forces round up fugitives wanted on us criminal charges 
the justice department said 
in addition to gen manuel antonio noriega there are a number 
of other fugitives from us law said justice department spokesman 
david runkel 
we will round up as many people as we can who are wanted in 
this country on charges many of them drugrelated runkel told 
reporters 
a team of more than 10 fbi and dea agents was being sent to 
panama to help us military authorities make the arrests runkel 
said 
noriega and 16 associates were named in two 1988 federal 
drugtrafficking indictments returned by grand juries in miami and 
tampa fla 
runkel said noreiga is accused of making 10 million by shipping 
cocaine and marijuana from colombia through panama to the united 
states 
if noriega is captured runkel said the justice department 
would try him first on the miami charges the miami indictment 
returned feb 4 1988 accuses noriega of receiving more than 46 
million to protect cocaine shipments from medellin colombia that 
were shipped to this country through panama 
under an opinion issued last month by the justice departments 
office of legal counsel us military forces overseas have the 
power to arrest and detain criminal suspects 
the opinion which runkel said was not issued in response to 
preparations for a panama invasion will empower us forces to 
help round up criminal suspects such as noriega 
runkel meanwhile offered a legal justification for the us 
invasion in panama saying attorney general dick thornburgh 
believes there is a legal basis for this action being taken under 
us law 
the attorney general met with president bush on tuesday to 
discuss the operation and give his legal advice runkel said 
runkel cited the inherent right of selfdefense in article 
51 of the united nations charter and the right of the us 
government to protect its citizens military installations and 
institutions under article 21 of the organization of american 
states treaty 
the panama canal treaty also empowers the united states to 
protect and defend the canal and its availability to all nations 
runkel said 
the spokesman said that the democratically elected government 
of panama was consulted prior to and welcomed the action taken by 
the united states

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers 
throughout the country 
dec 18 
fort worth texas startelegram on military cuts 
as the defense department budget shrinks in response to the 
improving climate of superpower relations and the unravelling of 
the soviet unions satellite system in eastern europe intense 
internecine warfare already has erupted among the different 
branches of the us military over the available bucks 
that is evidenced in the reaction of marine corps planners to 
army plans to trim down and tailor its forces the marine corps 
contends that the army would be trespassing upon its mission and 
attempting to do something that the marine corps can do better 
by 1995 army personnel would be reduced from 764000 to 
630000 about 70000 of the 220000 troops now stationed in europe 
would be brought home more emphasis would be placed on airborne 
air assault and light infantry divisions effectively transforming 
the army into a contingency force capable of being deployed 
worldwide 
far beit from mere civilians to decide which point of view is 
the more correct militarily but it doesnt take a general to 
figure out that the real quarrel is about how the reduced defense 
department pie will be sliced 
over the years interservice rivalry has bedeviled defense 
budgeting with the cutbacks that are coming however the separate 
branches may be forced to take a more comprehensive view of 
national security needs and learn to fit their plans into the big 
picture

almost 30 years after american pilot gary powers was brought

the soviet union nato at us urging is prepared to allow 
overflights by warsaw pact aircraft this could be a major break in 
eastwest tensions provided that the proposal works both ways 
it was president dwight d eisenhower who proposed a policy of 
open skies but the soviets mired in their traditional 
paranoia rejected the idea today while nothing seems out of the 
question it still will require a major attitude adjustment by the 
soviets if overflights are to become routine military activity

informal gettogethers has eased the frictions that are inevitable 
even between allies 
but sometimes bush puts too much stock in such methods such is 
the case with china 
bush was the envoy to beijing for a while in the 1970s and he 
believes that he and chinas leaders are personal friends 
bushs eagerness to overlook the bloodshed under the nose of 
deng xiaoping is pathetic 
bush is all too eager to forget about this springs violence in 
tiananmen square at the behest of the chinese government he 
vetoed a bill that would allow chinese students already in the 
united states to stay even though most of them face a dangerous 
future should they return home today 
bush wants business as usual with china the problem is that as 
long as deng and his cohorts run the show business as usual comes 
down to death and repression we can do better than that

the couriertribune asheboro nc on uschina relations 
last june when the chinese authorities brutally quashed 
students peaceful protest for democracy in tiananmen square 
americans were horrified 
when president bush sent three diplomatic officals to meet 
with the chinese authorities we were incredulous 
acting under unfortunate aplomb bush saw a need for our country 
to inform chna on the happenings of the malta summit and 
apparently that need eclipsed the memory of junes massacre bushs 
move comes off as a slap in the face of the student protesters who 
lost their lives on june 4 and in countless executions since 
america cannot continue to cry democratic wolf as a nation we 
support and defend democracy and human rights around the world in 
the philippines central america and eastern europe 
yet our top officials also take tea with toplevel chinese 
officials a move that sends a worldwide message that all is well 
on the chineseamerican front 
the president cannot undo his diplomatic lapse of reason but 
america can try to temper the negative ramifications of this visit 
we can continue economic sanctions begun last june against china 
congress can override bushs veto of a bill that would have allowed 
chinese students fearful of returning home to stay in america and 
bush can keep his diplomatic officials out of chinese conference 
rooms 
otherwise whats to prevent the rest of the world particularly 
as the nations of eastern europe cut their democratic teeth from 
doubting the sincerity of our support

a new church chime that rings and plays 
hymns during the day frightens dogs and birds and wakes small 
children from their naps says a neighborhood group that wants the 
electronic bells silenced 
its like having a grandfather clock with monster speakers put 
in the middle of your home without your permission said vaughan 
pritchett who lives two doors away 
pritchett said monday the three couples who sued tried to 
negotiate with bellshire united methodist church for two months but 
could not reach a compromise he said he regrets the holiday timing 
of the suit but he wants the christmas hymns and other melodies 
toned down 
the carillon was installed in september with 7700 donated by a 
former church member in memory of her son said the rev stephen 
smith pastor at bellshire 
the bells are played from four speakers each day until early 
evening they strike the hour six times a day and play hymns three 
times 
we have half a dozen people who live as close to the church as 
these people do who love the carillon he said 
we could raise the volume a lot higher but were respecting 
the neighbors smith said we did respect the neighbor who goes 
to bed early and we quit striking the hour at 7 pm 
a letter filed with the lawsuit from walter h collins a public 
health environmentalist said a test in september showed the bells 
were louder than a typical freight train heard from a distance of 
100 feet 
a court hearing was scheduled for jan 3

the pittsburgh press on personal saving habits 
one discouraging aspect of the remarkable us economic boom of 
the 1980s was the decline of personal saving among wage earners 
fortunately that trend is slowly being reversed 
as a percentage of gross national product the personal savings 
rate in the united states has risen from less than 4 percent in the 
mid1980s to 54 percent this year 
but americans still lag behind other industrialized nations in 
their saving habits during the presidential campaign george bush 
promised to encourage saving and now his administration is 
considering a number of proposals to fulfill the pledge they may 
be onto something 
the proposal currently floating around the white house and 
treasury department for inclusion in the 1991 budget is 
tentatively called the family savings account it would allow 
people of all incomes to contribute as much as 5000 a year to 
their account after 10 years the interest and dividends would be 
taxexempt although the money could be withdrawn 
the plan should be attractive to policymakers because 
exemptions wouldnt begin for 10 years loss of revenues to the 
government would be incremental and more easily predictable the 
5000 ceiling would draw more money into the savings pool than 
other plans including the ira which sets a 2000 limit per year 
and unlike iras in which savings arent released until retirement 
the family accounts would allow acxcess to savings much sooner 
if the plan has a fault its that it doesnt go far enough 
we know how washington hates to lose money but if greater 
personal saving is the goal and its a good one bolder ideas 
may be in order

speaking before a senate committee president reagans former 
press secretary who was shot and permanently injured during john 
hinckleys 1981 assassination attempt on reagan charged that 
congress is cowed by the national rifle association from passing 
reasonable gun control laws 
one proposal which is named after brady would require a 
nationwide sevenday waiting period and a police background check 
for all handgun purchases to make sure the buyer had no criminal 
record or was not mentally ill a weeks delay in picking up a 
handgun is not unreasonable 
the nra and its allies on capitol hill argue that such a law 
would victimize innocent sports people nonsense the 
inconvenience would be minimal and the benefit could be the saving

the greenville sc news on the philippines 
the serious domestic problems in the philippines have raised 
questions about continued american support for president corazon 
aquino in the midst of the coup the bush administration provided 
limited military support for her beleaguered government since then 
questions have been raised about whether its wise for the united 
states to strongly ally itself with aquinos troubled 
administration 
it should be noted that there is a difference between support 
for aquino and support for democracy the point of american aid to 
the aquino government is that it backs a popularly elected 
government in the face of an attempt to overthrow it by military 
force 
if democracy survives in the philippines the people will have 
an opportunity to turn out corazon aquino and her government at the 
polls american policy is quite properly based on helping to ensure 
the philippine people have that chance 
after decades of repression under the dictatorship of ferdinand 
marcos freedom in the philippines is especially fragile the 
united states in keeping with its long and close relationship with 
the philippines has an obligation to aid the continued development 
of democracy in that country

argus leader sioux falls sd on leona helmsley 
as newsweek magazine once told the story after leona helmsleys 
only son died she sued his poor widow to get a ring returned 
reportedly the billionaire hotel queen also would secretly drop 
bread crumbs on the dining room floor of her mansion to test the 
efficiency of the cleaning staff and she would fire other workers 
with little provocation or sympathy 
most notoriously of all she once told an employee we dont 
pay taxes only little people pay taxes 
its easy to see why the selfanointed hotel queen of new york 
has developed into such a despised person across the united states 
last week in new york she finally got what she deserved us 
district judge john walker sentenced helmsley to four years in 
prison and to 750 hours of communited their blood ties yet spontaneously 
saw something else in 
him calling him lamb of god who atones for human wrongs 
although protesting his unworthiness for it john baptized 
jesus who insisted on it 
as he emerged dripping from the water a heavenly glow like a 
dove descended on him the account says and a voice sounded 
this is my beloved son with whom i am well pleased 
eventually as jesus ministry began agents of galilees king 
herod antipas seized john the baptist imprisoned him in a dungeon 
and finally beheaded him at the coaxing of the kings dancing 
stepdaughter 
gospel accounts say the imprisonment resulted from johns 
attacks on herod switching wives in a bigamous marriage but 
ancient jewish historian josephus says john also was suspected of 
inciting insurrection 
while in prison john had begun to wonder about jesus ministry 
and sent followers to ask are you he who is to come or shall we 
look for another 
jesus responded go and tell john what you hear and see the 
blind receive their sight and the lame walk lepers are cleansed 
and the deaf hear and the poor have good news preached to them 
and blessed is he who takes no offense at me 
this hinted at possible rivalry between them but jesus went on 
to extol the baptizer 
while christianity generally has minimized john as simply a 
forerunner of jesus the record shows lingering ties between them 
johns influence lasted long afterward in many places as related by 
the missionaryapostle paul 
jesus in his preaching often referred to john asking 
challenging questions about him to stump critics some 
contemporaries saw jesus as johns successor thinking jesus was 
the baptizer raised from the dead 
indicating the bracketing of their work jesus apostles once 
asked lord teach us to pray as john taught his disciples 
jesus then recited under pressure of johns example that 
famous prayer known to all christianity as the lords prayer 
yet there was a poignant note as john watched his own star 
fading and that of jesus brightening he must increase but i 
must decrease john told his followers yet this joy of mine in 
now full 
grasping the historical solidarity between john and jesus 
writes new testament scholar wr farmer has become an essential 
first step toward an understanding of the mission and message of 
jesus 
the baptizer says the fourth gospel was not the light but 
came to bear witness to the light

about 650000 workers staged a brief 
warning strike wednesday after the serbian republic rejected a 
package of reforms proposed by the countrys reformist government 
headed by premier ante markovic 
laborers in belgrade which is both the national and the serbian 
capital stopped working for half an hour to protest the 
governments austerity measures the state tanjug news agency said 
drivers store assistants and others gathered at their 
workplaces to read a demand by belgrade trade unions for easing new 
austerity measures 
the unions said the strike was designed to warn the federal 
government to pay more attention to impoverished people who 
may find their low standards of living dip even lower with the 
proposed reforms 
markovics program calls for a sixmonth wage freeze and 
creation of a convertible dinar along with other unprecedented 
sweeping economic and political reforms designed to pull yugoslavia 
out of its economic slump 
the program which requires approval by the legislature at its 
current session slated to end later wednesday also calls for an 
end to state subsidies to moneylosing companies which may result 
in laying off of at least 150000 workers according to official 
government sources 
serbias officially controlled media unanimously condemned the 
proposed reforms 
filip grujic serbias vice premier told the serbian parliament 
tuesday the program will drastically imperil the position of the 
most impoverished people in the entire country 
all five other constituent republics however gave green light 
to markovics proposed reforms and plans for political pluralism in 
the country 
serbia is calling for shortterm measures to curb inflation 
such as price freezes such price freezes have previously succeeded 
in holding down consumer costs but when the restrictions were 
lifted inflation soared to record levels 
a prolonged dispute between the leaderships of yugoslavias 
constituent republics over the countrys political and economic 
future came to a head in november when the conservative serbian 
government broke off all business and political ties with liberal 
slovenia

followers of panamanian leader gen manuel antonio noriega

consecutive year to a record 248 million vehicles next year

the department of defense activated a news 
media pool that arrived in panama today alongside us troops 
dispatched by president bush the pool was developed after the 
controversy over secrecy surrounding the 1982 american military 
operation in grenada 
the purpose of the pool is to be there at the beginning of the 
operation said a pentagon official who spoke on condition that 
he not be further identified he said pentagon pools are usually 
disbanded after the first several days as other reporters arrive on 
the scene 
notifying and assembling the pool takes place under terms of 
secrecy that are unusual for the press the pentagon requires that 
pool members not tell others about their assignment 
we ask them to tell their families that they have been called 
to work that is not that unusual late at night for journalists we 
ask them not to have their spouses drive them to andrews air force 
base but to drive themselves or find some other way of getting 
there said the pentagon source 
the pentagon pool in panama is made up of journalists from the 
following news organizations the associated press united press 
international reuters time magazine abc radio nbc television 
houston chronicle houston post and dallas morning news 
the initial writers report was received at midmorning 
wednesday but news organizations were still waiting for 
photography from the pool well after noon 
news executives receive short notice when a pool is being 
activated and assign the staff members who provide coverage their 
material is made available to other media organizations that do not 
take part participation in the pool is rotated several times a 
year 
news executives notified that the pool has been activated are 
also sworn to secrecy 
the first pool was formed in april 1985 and they have been 
assembled on average of twice a year since then officials said 
one pool accompanied us navy warships escorting oil tankers 
through the persian gulf in july 1987 but most times reporters 
receiving the midnight summons have watched military maneuvers 
the most recent previous pool also went to panama in may 1989 
a 12member group that accompanied the first extra detachment of 
marines sent there in operation nimrod dancer that pool was not 
kept secret because president bush announced the operation earlier 
in the day

thee more people were killed 
in factional fighting in natal province police said wednesday and 
a parliament member said natals biggest hospital for blacks should 
be declared a disaster area 
carole charlewood who represents a natal district for the 
antiapartheid democratic party said in a letter to the health 
ministry that the escalation of violence around the port city of 
durban has aggravated already critical problems at king edward viii 
hospital 
she said the hospital staff is treating 20 to 30 gunshot victims 
a day and patients were exposed to squalor overcrowding and 
humiliation 
the pressures on operating theaters and staff means that 
other patients requiring surgery must be bypassed which has 
resulted in many unnecessary deaths mrs charlewood wrote 
patients also are dying because the intensive care unit 
facilities are hopelessly inadequate 
the health ministry said health minister rina venter was aware 
of the problems at king edward and giving them appropriate 
attention 
scores of blacks have been killed in and around the durbanarea 
township of inanda this month one of the worst surges of violence 
during a threeyear power struggle in natal between members of the 
relatively conservative zulu organization inkatha and supporters of 
militant antiapartheid groups about 2500 people have been killed 
in the feud 
the police unrest report wednesday gave few details about the 
latest killings saying one man was shot to death in the 
durbanarea township of molweni and two killed in their home by 
attackers near the town of richmond 
on tuesday law and order minister adriaan vlok toured 
battlescarred sections of inanda he was accompanied by mangosuthu 
buthelezi leader of inkatha and chief minister of the 
semiautonomous black homeland of kwazulu 
vlok told reporters that poverty high unemployment and 
appalling living conditions were a major factor behind the 
inanda violence but he said peace was unlikely unless there is a 
change of heart away from hating one another 
buthelezi says he is as firmly opposed to apartheid as more 
militant groups aligned to the outlawed african national congress 
but he opposes the ancs use of violence and its advocacy of 
confrontational tactics such as strikes sanctions and 
demonstrations

people who climb mount everest and other lofty 
peaks may suffer oxygen deprivation that damages their brains and 
results in temporary memory trouble according to a study 
the research on 35 mountaineers found mild impairments of 
longterm memory as well as difficulty spelling and following 
simple commands while the problems showed up on psychological 
tests most were too modest to hinder the climbers daily lives 
while the research suggests the impairment eventually eases the 
researchers were unsure whether it always goes away 
when you go to extremely high altititudes you are getting 
close to the threshhold of oxygen lack that can cause an impairment 
of brain function said dr thomas f hornbein it looks like 
most of it is transient in most people but some are more 
susceptible than others 
hornbein an anesthesiologist at the university of washington 
outlined the results in thursdays new england journal of medicine 
the study was based on tests administered to 34 men and one 
woman before and after trips to mount everest or tirich mir from 
1981 to 1984 
reports of memory loss and other apparent brain damage among 
mountaineers first surfaced following british journeys to mount 
everest in the 1920s and 1930s 
there is a lot of individual variability said hornbein 
one would expect that repeated exposure will produce greater and 
longerlasting impairment but there are probably people who can go 
high and not have any problem whatsoever 
he noted that the brain has tremendous capacity to recover from 
injury and is probably able to compensate for most of the death of 
brain cells that apparently results from temporary oxygen 
deprivation 
hornbein who climbed mount everest in 1963 said the 
possibility of temporary brain damage should be kept in 
perspective considering all the hazards of mountaineering 
most climbers would consider this a pretty trivial risk in 
comparison with all the others he said

members of congress in both parties today 
supported president bushs assault against panamas manuel antonio 
noriega although one democrat said bush should have consulted with 
allies in advance and another called him triggerhappy 
i support the presidents decision senate majority leader 
george mitchell dmaine said in a brief statement from mexico 
city where he was meeting with government officials it was made 
necessary by the reckless actions of gen noriega 
i hope that the restoration of democracy to panama will occur 
as soon as possible mitchell said i deeply regret the loss of 
life which resulted 
house speaker thomas s foley dwash also offered his 
support i think under the circumstances the decision is 
justified he said bush asked him for his support in a telephone 
call at about 10 pm tuesday 
when there is the engagement of us forces in the field it 
behooves all of us to giver that support foley told reporters 
my immediate reaction is at last said rep les aspin 
dwis chairman of the house armed services committee after the 
failed coup of october the administration faced two choices stow 
its antinoriega rhetoric and leave itself to the whims of events 
or take the initiative and intervene the latter was the better 
choice 
and sen sam nunn dga chairman of the senate armed services 
committee said he hoped the rest of the world would take note of 
the unique circumstances that faced bush it is unfortunate 
that the united states has been required to take these steps in 
panama when it is asking for restraint on the part of the soviet 
union and china he said 
i called to tell the president my compliments to the 
chef said sen jesse helms of north carolina the ranking 
republican on the foreign relations committee 
the majority of the senate will feel good by this turn of 
events helms predicted in a phone call he placed to the 
associated press 
however sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the senate 
foreign relations committee said bush should not have sent us 
soldiers into action in panama without the support and aid of other 
central american nations 
personally unless very clear evidence emerges of a direct 
threat against the panama canal or against american people or 
installations i would not have engaged in such unilateral or such 
goitalone action said pell 
but pell said he would support the administration until the 
attack aimed at unseating noriega was completed and he hoped for 
as few deaths as possible to soldiers 
rep don edwards dcalif issued a harshly critical statement 
calling bushs action a triggerhappy act of gunboat diplomacy 
that continues our mindless 100year abuse of small central 
american nations 
edwards chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on the 
constitution said bush had violated the provision which requires 
congress consent to go to war there was no danger to our 
national security from this weak small country nor was the panama 
canal in real peril he said 
and rep ted weiss dny interviewed on cable news network 
said it seems to me that what the president is doing is trying 
to correct for his failure to back up the insurgent forces in the 
panamanian defense forces back in october and i think he was wrong 
on both occasions he didnt provide sufficient support last time 
and hes doing overkill this time 
sen richard lugar of indiana a senior republican on the 
foreign relations committee called the action an overwhelming 
success because democracy has now been inaugurated and installed in 
panama 
the canal is safe americans are safe lugar said adding 
that the operation was a very important moment in the presidency 
of george bush it is a time when the president asserted his own 
leadership and did so effectively 
sen carl levin dmich a member of the senate armed services 
committee endorsed bushs decision and praised the action as a 
blow against the international drug trade 
we need to see how it plays out said senate republican 
leader robert dole in a telephone interview with the ap i would 
guess there would be widespread bipartisan support for the 
president 
bush ordered the us troops to panama city to apprehend noriega 
and bring him to the united states to stand trial on drugsmuggling 
charges said white house spokesman marlin fitzwater the move also 
was intended to protect american lives as well as the panama canal 
he said 
i think the president has done the right thing and i suspect 
hell have pretty widespread support in congress sen slade 
gorton rwash said in an interview with seattlebased kirotv 
white house officials said top congressional leaders had been 
briefed on the mission to seize noriega by force 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the senate foreign 
relations subcommittee on the western hemisphere also was briefed 
about the operation he said on cbs this morning that members 
of congress he had talked to are standing by president bush on 
this decision 
gorton called noriega and his followers simply lawless bandits 
who broke up a free election and are ruling as nothing more or less 
than a drug cartel and have constantly escalated their 
provocations against americans and the security of the panama 
canal 
sen pete wilson rcalif called noriega a murderous thug 
who should be brought to trial in the united states for 
drugsmuggling noriega has been indicted on narcotics smuggling 
charges by grand juries in miami and tampa fla 
president bush was requested to intervene with armed force by 
the duly elected president of panama president guillermo endara 
whose administration was denied from taking office by noriegas 
thugs after being elected wilson said in a statement his office 
delivered to the aps los angeles bureau 
dole said he met with endara and other elected panamanian 
officials dec 10 and they were in effect pleading with us to do 
something about noriega 
rep henry hyde rill interviewed on wbbmam radio in 
chicago said im satisfied and gratified that the operation is 
under way after the earlier failed coup attempt in panama he 
said we looked impotent we looked like lilliputians

although japanese is the most rapidly growing 
foreign language course on american college campuses a major 
national program is needed to offer noneuropean languages to more 
students said a study released wednesday 
the study conducted by johns hopkins university foreign 
language specialist richard d lambert for the american council on 
education said traditional west european languages are still the 
heavy favorites among university students 
the study showed 204 percent of college students were studying 
spanish 168 percent french and 71 percent german in 1986 at 13 
institutions surveyed italian was the choice of 24 percent and 
russian the choice of 18 percent of university students surveyed 
japanese was picked by 22 percent of the students at 11 
universities that offered it but has tripled in the last three or 
four years lambert told a news conference 
i was surprised by the spread of the less commonly studied 
languages particularly japanese chinese russian and a little bit 
of arabic he said 
mandarin chinese was being studied by 21 percent of students at 
10 universities arabic was the choice of onehalf of one percent 
of the students at five universities offering it 
while you still get the bulk of students coming in and 
continuing in french german and spanish you are getting some 
diffusion in the colleges and in high schools he said maybe 
300 high schools teach japanese and more teach russian and 
chinese 
one of the problems lambert said is that students take 
language in the 9th and 10th grades and then it goes fallow in the 
11th and 12th grades and is not built upon at the college level 
you have got a lot of students getting a little bit of 
language he said 
what is clearly needed for collegiate level foreign language 
teaching is a major national effort dedicated to introducing major 
change and upgrading the system 
federal funds for foreign language instruction he said go 
almost exclusively for programs to teach defense department 
personnel and other government employes 
it is high time the nation invested the necessary private and 
public resources needed to advance foreign language instruction at 
the collegiate level lambert wrote in the study 
the american council on education is a cluster of educational 
organizations and institutions the study was funded by grants from 
the ford foundation the exxon educational foundation and the pew 
charitable trusts

condemnation of brutal repression of protesters in romania and 
prominent britons demanded that hardline president nicolae 
ceausescu be stripped of a knighthood that was bestowed on him 
with deep pain we have all heard the news of dead and wounded 
in some romanian cities the pope said 
his comment on the violence in which up thousands may have been 
killed came at the end of his regular weekly audience john paul 
said he was praying that human rights and religious liberty would 
prevail in romania which is controlled by the last stalinist 
regime in the soviet bloc 
ceausescu who has ruled romania for 24 years was given the 
knight grand cross of the order of the bath the highest honor for

vance ruled in favor of the jacksonville naacp on sept 15 in a 
school desegregation case 
the letter received in jackson bore an atlanta postmark dated 
aug 21 the day before a teargas cannister exploded in that 
citys naacp office injuring eight people jones declined to 
describe the postmarks on the other letters except to say they 
were sent in late august 
all four letters were examined by the fbi laboratory in 
washington but yielded no further physical clues such as 
fingerprints jones said us marshals in the various 
jurisdictions were told of the threatening letters jones 
the letter attacking the 11th circuit threatened poison gas 
attacks on large cities to force the court to adopt fair and 
impartial treatment of all 
entitled declaration of war the letter said the 11th 
circuit does deliberately and wrongfully refuse to fulfill its 
obligation to protect the innocent 
the courts failure to render impartial and equitable 
judgments is due to rank bias and the mistaken belief its victims 
cannot effectively retaliate the letter said 
the jackson television station said it immediately turned the 
letter over to the fbi 
three weeks after the letter surfaced the 11th circuit 
published vances opinion for the unanimous threejudge panel in 
the jacksonville school case it reversed a lowercourt ruling that 
jacksonville schools could stop busing to achieve racial 
integration 
on saturday vance was killed in his mountain brook ala home 
after opening a parcel mailed to him 
on monday a similar bomb was found at the 11th circuit 
courthouse in atlanta and removed without incident hours later 
robinson was fatally injured in his savannah law office when he 
opened the parcel mailed to him 
on tuesday authorities found a similar bomb at the office of 
the jacksonville naacp which brought the school case 
fbi director william sessions told reporters tuesday he would 
not be surprised if the vance murder was related to cases he had 
worked on as a federal appellate judge 
sessions said vances court docket would be carefully studied to 
determine if his rulings may have sparked a racially motivated 
murder 
sessions implied that the bureau did not have a suspect and 
indicated there might be more than one perpetrator 
as far as i know theres been no claimant of responsibility at 
all sessions said at a news conference at the justice department 
sessions said investigators found no similarities between the 
bomb incidents and the actions of extremist white groups but it 
is something you cannot rule out 
we would hope the patterns of these types of groups when 
studied carefully and compared will yield fruit sessions said 
asked about racial motivation sessions said when the naacp 
headquarters receives a suspicious package an alderman is killed 
you have to have that in the back of your mind 
the package containing the bomb that killed vance bore the 
return address of another 11th circuit judge lewis f morgan a 
government source said in washington 
morgan who had previously sent packages to vance is not a 
suspect but the evidence suggests that the killer was familiar with 
the two judges friendship said the source who spoke on condition 
of anonymity 
thornburgh called the incidents an affront to our nations 
commitment to the rule of law and said he had assured civil 
rights leaders the case would be thoroughly investigated

ten years ago guerrilla chieftain 
robert mugabe put pen to paper in london to end a bloody sevenyear 
war for control of his homeland britains last colonial outpost in 
africa known as rhodesia 
that allparty peace pact signed on dec 21 1979 silenced the 
guns and led to the birth of blackgoverned zimbabwe four months 
later 
a decade later as president of zimbabwe mugabe is on the 
receiving end of offensives across the eastern border by rebels 
based in mozambique 
while mugabe was able to lead rhodesia to peace as zimbabwe 
through talks he is opposed to similar direct negotiations with 
the insurgents who have threatened to bring their war into 
zimbabwe 
alfonso dhlakamas mozambique national resistance seeks to 
undermine mozambique president joaquim chissanos socialist 
government 
the 12yearold war has left an estimated 500000 to 700000 
dead and created about 1 million mozambican refugees almost half 
of mozambiques 15 million people require some food aid 
the guerrillas also sabotage roads and railways vital to 
landlocked zimbabwes economy and mugabe has stationed 12000 
troops in mozambique at a crippling cost of 450000 a day 
dhlakamas rebels now routinely cross the scrubstudded plains 
and pinecarpeted mountains into zimbabwe to raid tea and coffee 
plantations native villages and state schools 
hundreds of zimbabweans have been slain or abducted in these 
forays and tens of thousands have been herded into stateguarded 
villages upsetting life all along the 800mile frontier 
the rhodesians forced many people into socalled protected 
villages when they were fighting mugabes guerrillas said a 
roman catholic missionary who spoke on condition of anonymity 
so there are villagers today who are suspicious that theyre 
being placed in similar settlements by the government they 
support 
but missionaries back the governments contention that 
zimbabweans are better off behind wire and under guard because of 
the rebels 
the guerrillas known also by their portuguese acronym renamo 
have been accused of widespread atrocities including the killing 
of children mutilating of victims rape and destruction of entire 
communities 
the rebels were founded in 1977 by former rhodesian prime 
minister ian d smith to hound mugabes guerrillas in their 
mozambican bases 
mugabe ended aid for renamo when he came to power and no 
government currently acknowledges assistance 
mugabe and kenyan president daniel arap moi have been acting as 
intermediaries in indirect talks in kenya between the rebels and 
the mozambique government there have been no breakthroughs since 
the talks began in july 
mugabe has long said he opposes direct formal peace talks for 
mozambique insisting renamo disavow violence and lay down its arms 
first 
renamo in turn demands zimbabwe withdraw its troops from 
mozambique before facetoface negotiations can be considered 
renamo also demands that mozambiques government allow it to 
take part in elections as a legal party 
the mozambican government says it will not accept a second party 
but is considering a proposal that would allow people who are not 
in the ruling party to run for parliament

</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the united states and panama will administer the canal jointly 
until the expiration of the treaty on dec 31 1999 at that time 
control management and maintenance of the canal go to the 
panamanian government 
the us president was to appoint a panamanian nominated by his 
government as administrator to take charge of the canal on jan 1 
1990 but the united states refuses to recognize the government of 
gen manuel antonio noriega and has spurned his choice for the 
post 
president george bush announced dec 5 he asked the canals 
deputy administrator panamanian fernando manfredo to take over as 
acting administrator manfedo accepted 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for the duration of the treaty the united states has primary 
responsibility for the defense of the canal a board of us and 
panamanian military officers was established to consult on defense 
matters and every five years reviews military resources made 
available by both countries during the life of the treaty the 
united states decides on its own how and when to reduce its forces 
in the canal zone and schedule the closing of its bases 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
the united states pays panama 50 million to 60 million from 
canal revenue and an additional 10 million a year for the canals 
operation panama also received 50 million in military assistance 
over a 10year period 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
about 70 percent of the 500squaremile canal zone reverted to 
panama after the treaty was ratified the united states retained 
temporary control over the rest including areas considered vital 
to running the canal 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
three years after ratification american civilian employees in 
the canal zone became subject to panamanian law instead of american 
law panama took responsibility for public and social services 
including schools the canal zone police force and postal service 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
under a separate treaty the two countries agreed to a guarantee 
that the canal would remain open to ships of all nations and that 
the canals neutrality would be respected in times of war as in 
times of peace american and panamanian warships and other 
vessels were given priority to use the canal

the us economy grew at a faster rate in the 
third quarter than previously estimated the government said 
wednesday but analysts say it is fast running out of steam and 
some suggest it is flirting with a recession 
the commerce department said the gross national product the 
broadest measure of economic health grew at an annual rate of 3 
percent in the julyseptember period up from a 25 percent rate 
reported in october and the subsequent revision to 27 percent last 
month 
however analysts said the economic growth in the third quarter 
borrowed its strength from the current quarter when many see a 
growth rate of less than 1 percent and possibly an end to the 
unprecedented seven years of peacetime expansion 
the administration is forecasting a 27 percent growth rate for 
all of 1989 and the fourthquarter gnp would have to advance 16 
percent to meet that goal the gnp grew by 37 percent in the first 
quarter and 25 percent in the second 
the bottom line is that we borrowed from the future to produce 
3 percent growth and that source of strength is gone now said 
allen sinai chief economist for the boston co 
sinai and others said much of the thirdquarter growth resulted 
from robust earlierthannormal sales of automobiles and light 
trucks in the third quarter that were driven by incentives 
but the incentives were dropped with the introduction of 
higherpriced 1990 models in october and sales immediately slumped 
only this month have automakers begun to restore rebates and lower 
interest rates that chief economist david berson of the federal 
national mortgage association said could boost sales early next 
year 
many analysts had suggested the federal reserve would have to 
ease credit further to stimulate the economy and the central bank 
late tuesday added money to the banking system in a signal that it 
might lower interest rates 
as a result the key federal funds rate the interest banks 
charge each other for overnight loans dropped to 8 716 percent 
from about 8 percent late tuesday analysts said they expected a 
target of 8 percent for the rate the first drop since late 
november 
samuel d kahan chief financial economist at kleinwort benson 
government securities inc in chicago forecast fourthquarter 
growth of 1 percent with continued weakness in the first quarter of 
1990 
i think a lot will depend on monetary policy kahan said 
if the fed continues to drag its heels it could continue to get 
weakness and could turn this into a recession 
but even with further easing by the central bank kahan said he 
expects a somewhat lackluster first quarter returning to 2 
percent to 25 percent growth later in the year 
sinai on the other hands says that while economic data does 
not support his view i think were in some sort of recession 
now 
the sluggish fourthquarter growth is a result of fed efforts to 
contain inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit inflation 
appeared to begin moderating earlier this year and since june the 
central bank has eased some shortterm interest rates 
its policymaking arm the federal open market committee met 
secretly monday and tuesday but as usual gave no indication of 
any decisions 
the gnp report contained favorable inflation news however a 
price index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 29 percent 
unchanged from earlier estimates but down from the 5 percent jump 
in the apriljune quarter 
the revision in the latest report was due in large part to new 
data that showed exports rose 39 percent rather than 16 percent 
as reported earlier at the same time imports fell from a 95 
percent gain first reported to 74 percent in the latest report 
consumer spending however dropped to a 56 percent increase 
rather than the 62 percent advance reported last month consumer 
spending represents twothirds of the nations economic activity 
business capital spending posted a 52 percent gain compared 
with 46 percent in last months report possibly reflecting an 
improvement in the decline of corporate profits 
in that report the commerce department said aftertax profits 
of us corporations fell 54 percent rather than the 72 percent 
decline reported in november 
housing construction hit by high mortgage interest rates during 
much of the year fell 92 percent in the third quarter it was 
reported to be off 84 percent a month ago 
government purchases were down 24 percent 03 percentage point 
below the november estimate 
the various changes left the gnp expanding in the third quarter 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 416 trillion

marriott hotels president bill tiesel were trying to get through 
to the hotel but having little success conner said 
but the hotel officials had been in touch with the us 
government from marriotts standpoint we are taking every 
effort to have the us military troops secure the hotel so that 
guests can be protected he said 
the hotel the panama marriott caesar park is owned by aoki 
construction inc a japanese company but it is managed by 
marriott opened in 1982 the hotel is adjacent to the atlapa

four young brothers upset by a sears 
roebuck and co christmas catalog toy that features an exploding 
rocket booster have taken on the giant retailer and apparently won 
sabotage the rocket booster is how the holiday wishbook 
promotes an exploding toy rocket part of a series called building 
blasters 
angry over the association with the fatal january 1986 explosion 
of the space shuttle challenger the sanders boys fired off letters 
in september to sears executives and president bush 
we feel this is very sick humor wrote jared 13 and seth 
9 we dont want children learning to blow up space shuttles 
there are plenty of terrorists in the world already 
younger brothers spencer 5 and cody 3 also signed the 
letters 
rita guttke a sears customer relations official in chicago 
recently wrote the boys your concern is valid i doubt that this 
product will be offered in future catalogs 
the catalog distributed over the summer invited customers to 
build a rocket pad and detonate the accompanying rocket upon 
launch 
its pretty disgusting from both a parent and a schoolteacher 
point of view barbara morgan who was nasas backup teacher in 
space said tuesday 
mrs morgan of mccall witnessed the challenger explosion that 
killed all seven astronauts aboard including new hampshire teacher 
christa mcauliffe 
nasas james funkhouser a public services division director in 
the office of communications said he wrote a letter of complaint 
to sears a week ago after learning of the sanders protest but has 
not received a response 
the boys mother said sears reply to her sons was not enough 
theres no guarantee the toys are going to be off their 
shelves christa sanders said tuesday 
however the manufacturer kenner products inc said 
manufacturing and shipping of the toy have been discontinued due to 
poor sales 
john bohach vice president of advertising and marketing 
services at kenners cincinnati headquarters said the company had 
no intention of equating the toy with the challenger he said the 
company found that kids like to build things and like to knock 
them down 
the building blasters series includes an oil rig a fuel depot 
a suspension bridge and a communications tower 
in her letter to the sanders boys ms guttke said the 
possibility of encouraging terrorism never surfaced while the toy 
was being childtested 
sears spokesman gordon jones and kenners bohach both said the 
sanders childrens complaint was the only one they had heard

the us attack in panama city early today left many civilians 
dead in the streets and touched off a fire that leveled a slum area 
around a panamanian defense forces stronghold witnesses said 
us troops in helicopters warned townspeople in panamas 
capital of the impending attack assuring them by loudspeaker that 
the soldiers didnt have a problem with the government said 
one witness 
the witnesses spoke to reporters in boston by telephone 
they burned everything down manuel backalt said in an 
interview from a salvation army office near the defense forces 
headquarters where he fled with his wife and three children i 
see plenty people dead in the street 
he said the bodies he did not know how many were mainly 
members of the dignity battalions civilian paramilitary groups 
loyal to noriega 
speaking through an interpreter rolando diaz 32 who also took 
refuge in the salvation army office said there were warnings in 
the night of the coming attack 
before they started to bomb they warned those in the area of 
panamanian defense forces headquarters to come out he said 
they were shouting down over the pa system saying they didnt 
have a problem with the government 
at that point residents of the slum area surrounding the 
headquarters a section of mostly wooden homes headed into the

santa claus weighs too much probably has high 
cholesterol eats too many cookies on christmas eve and should 
exercise more than once a year but health experts are impressed by 
his longevity 
as far as physicians can determine saint nick is about 1700 
years old 
he must be doing something right to have lived this long 
kathy gonzalez a dietician at pittsburghs st margaret memorial 
hospital said 
health experts worry he inhales too much soot scurrying up and 
down chimneys and spends too much time in the cold 
he is clearly overweight and probably has a cardiac problem 
said eleanor streiff chief of disease control for the allegheny 
county health department he probably also has pulmonary problems 
from going down chimneys and getting all that dirt in his lungs 
also driving instructors and physicians wonder how a 
17centuryold man has managed to keep a license to operate an 
airborne vehicle even one powered by eight tiny reindeer 
santas unhealthy habits go back at least 180 years when 
washington irving described him as fat and was puffing a 
longstemmed pipe 
santa would certainly be at increased risk of cancer of the 
lip or mouth dr ronald heberman director of the pittsburgh 
cancer institute said 
the psychological impact of santa spending months of unending 
darkness at the north pole worries dr trevor price chairman of 
allegheny general hospitals psychiatry department 
price suggested santas toygiving spree is his way of coping 
with his generally gloomy winter mood 
but there is good news about santas health 
children are leaving glasses of lowfat milk and plates of 
highfiber cookies and muffins for him and that may help fend off 
the effects of the other risk factors said sharon sclabassi

then as now the invasion was launched in the 
predawn hours then as now the declared goal was to protect 
american citizens 
but the similarities between the american landing on the 
caribbean island of grenada on oct 25 1983 the last time us 
troops were sent on an invasion and wednesdays american 
intervention in panama are mostly superficial 
both were described as preemptive operations but logistically 
and strategically they are largely different 
the invasion of grenada spearheaded by 1900 marines and army 
rangers was undertaken with the stated purpose of protecting the 
lives of more than 600 american medical students from a marxist 
government that had taken the islands government by force oct 19 
president bush too said he had ordered us troops into panama 
to protect the lives of americans this time an estimated 35000 
many of them soldiers 
the presidential statements justifying the invasions was similar 
said reagan in 1983 
the united states objectives are clear to protect our own 
citizens to facilitate the evacuation of those who want to leave 
and to help in the restoration of democratic institutions in 
grenada 
said bush on wednesday 
the panamanian people want democracy peace and the chance 
for a better life in dignity and freedom the people of the united 
states seek only to support them in pursuit of these noble goals 
in panama us forces were under orders to capture manuel 
antonio noriega the countrys ruler who is under indictment in 
florida on drugtrafficking charges 
while both presidents said they were acting to restore 
democratic governments the grenada operation had broader regional 
implications 
reagan had grown increasingly concerned since 1981 about what he 
perceived as a cuban and soviet military buildup on grenada 
the us invasion was lent legitimacy by a request from six tiny 
eastern caribbean nations for us help to stop the military 
buildup which they believed could endanger their democratic 
governments 
indeed the us force was accompanied by 300 police officers 
and defense forces from four of grenadas caribbean neighbors 
although plans for both operations were long in the making the 
grenada invasion replicated a 1981 exercise the landing on 
grenada was much more of a surprise to the world many people 
didnt even know how to pronounce the name of the nutmegproducing 
island and its new leader bernard coard while years of us 
clashes with the defiant and provocative noriega have become almost 
legend 
the surprise six years ago was compounded by a lack of 
information about the operation in grenada because of a complete 
defense department news blackout reporters were given access to 
the island only on the fifth day 
the fighting in panama was closely covered from the start by the 
resident news corps and hours after the fighting began by a pool 
of us reporters flown there by the pentagon 
in panama the us invasion was supported and prepared by some 
13000 troops already stationed at american bases there in 
grenada there were no us military personnel on hand before the 
invasion 
the logistics of getting there were much harder said 
langhorne a motley who served as assistant secretary of state for 
interamerican affairs at the time of the grenada invasion 
the handkerchiefsize grenada 8 by 18 miles with a population 
of less than 100000 was a less complicated target than panama 
with its 30000 square miles and population of 23 million 
panama is a much messier place to operate with americans 
scattered around the country and a professional ustrained 
military motley said 
in grenada the us force which at the height of the invasion 
numbered about 7000 encountered a military force of several 
thousand sovietarmed troops aided by about 600 armed cubans there 
to construct a 9500foot airport runway that the united states 
said had no civilian use 
nineteen americans were killed in grenada several of them in 
accidents as well as 24 grenadans most of them when us planes 
mistakenly bombed a mental hospital also killed were 24 cubans 
the actual fighting for control of the island lasted about 36 
hours said otto reich a diplomat who headed the state department 
campaign to enlist public support for the grenada operation us 
troops stayed about seven weeks to defend the interim government 
and clean up pockets of cuban resistance 
but there was no real urban warfare unlike panama said 
reich

us troops smashed the regime of 
gen manuel antonio noriega on wednesday and installed a new 
government but the military ruler who antagonized a superpower 
fled into hiding and his loyalists seized some americans 
more than 20000 troops backed by warplanes began their invasion 
shortly after midnight tuesday under a full moon pounding 
panamanian military installations in and around the capital with 
mortar cannon and machinegun fire 
in the early afternoon smoke rose from the shattered 
headquarters of noriegas defense forces and sporadic gunfire was 
heard in the distance widespread looting broke out 
in the san miguelito neighborhood to the northeast attack jets 
bombed and helicopters strafed a defense forces barracks atop a 
hill 
more than 50 bodies were counted by one hospital early in the 
fighting but more bodies flooded in after daybreak officials in 
washington said nine american servicemen were among the dead 
hundreds of people were wounded 
president bush said he ordered the invasion after noriega said 
panama was in a state of war with the united states and after the 
shooting death last week of a us marine lieutenant 
he said the attack was a mission to capture noriega and bring 
him trial in the united states for allegedly trafficking in 
colombian cocaine 
gen noriegas reckless threats and attacks upon americans in 
panama created an imminent danger to the 35000 american citizens 
in panama bush said in speech to the nation 
secretary of state james a baker iii said the action was 
ordered after the administration received unconfirmed reports that 
noriega intended to attack a us residential neighborhood in 
panama 
pamanas national radio reported about 40 americans had been 
detained while cable news network said at least 10 americans 
were held hostage troops loyal to noriega were seen taking at 
least two americans away from panama citys marriott hotel 
opposition leader guillermo endara winner of the may 7 
elections that were voided by the noriegacontrolled government 
was sworn in as president and given immediate us backing 
bush later ordered that economic and political sanctions be 
lifted and authorized federal drug agents to pursue arrests in 
panama 
but provisional president francisco rodriguez and foreign 
minsiter leonardo kam both installed by noriega held a news 
conference at the foreign ministry office in the capital and 
declared they still governed 
the government controls the situation in the country and its 
institutions rodriguez said we are prepared to resist 
it was clear however that us troops controlled the capital 
the huge assault by marines infantrymen sailors airmen and 
paratroopers was the bloody pinnacle of washingtons long war with 
noriega a bellicose career soldier who had a strong core of 
support among working class people and who seemed to delight in 
defying the mighty united states 
noriega survived two coup attempts from within the panamanian 
defense forces that he headed including one october insurrection 
in which he was briefly captured he survived washingtons best 
nonmilitary efforts to oust him including harsh economic 
sanctions that severely depressed the economy 
there was strong evidence in the two previous coup attempts of 
dissatisfaction within the military with noriega and it was 
unclear how much of his support was holding after the us attack 
in his address bush said he intends to turn over the panama 
canal as required under existing treaties 
noriega has denied the drug charges and claims the united states 
wanted him out so it could renege on 1977 treaties that cede 
control of the panama canal by the year 2000 
at the fort clayton us base outside the capital us charge 
daffaires john bushnell said noriega may take to the hills and 
be very hard to find but he wouldnt have a significant force 
to actually do anything 
we will chase him and we will find him gen colin powell 
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said in washington 
powell said that nine american servicemen were killed 39 were 
wounded and one was missing 
rodriguez said more than 60 panamanians died in the fighting 
and several hundred were wounded mostly civilians he said us 
troops in the chorillo area where the fighting was heaviest did 
not allow the red cross to enter the area 
a man indentified only as major caballero said on national radio 
that 40 americans have been detained but that figure could not 
be confirmed 
two paramilitary panamanian troops arrived at the capitals 
marriott hotel at about 9 am and took away three americans the 
soldiers then asked the front desk for a list of guests and where 
they were staying the desk said it did not give it to them 
pentagon spokesman pete williams said us forces in panama were 
aware of hostages taken from the marriott we will make efforts 
to take care of that said williams declining to elaborate 
williams said he did not know how many americans were being held 
earlier in the invasion panamanian troops held 12 foreigners at 
the marriott including eight americans for about two hours

the soviet union condemned the us attack as gunboat 
diplomacy while britain offered support peru expressed outrage 
and recalled its washington ambassador 
venezeula summed up many reactions by saying it opposed 
noriegas regime but condemned the us military intervention 
the un security council was considering nicaraguas request 
for an emergency meeting to consider the us intervention at the 
un meeting panama will demand that the united states withdraw 
its invading troops immediately rodriguez said 
the us assault began about midnight tuesday as forces attacked 
panamanian military headquarters which witnesses said was 
destroyed 
fighting also was reported at a panamanian cavalry unit about 
seven miles east of the defense forces headquarters and at the 
panamanian base fort cimarron about 20 miles from the capital 
about 9500 american troops from bases in the united states were 
flown in to augment the 12000 soldiers based in panama 
panamas defense forces has 15000 men noriega also has armed 
citizen dignity battalions 
noriegas main bodyguard lt asuncion gaitan spoke on national 
radio after dawn to say that noriega was well and in a safe 
place 
dont anyone give up your positions he said gaitan then 
gave a series of messages using code names and instructions 
fighting continued after dawn in old panama just east of the 
marriott and in san miguelito a poor district northeast of the 
city center 
the panama canal was closed at 1 am because of the fighting 
said panama canal commission spokesman franklin castrellon he said 
landslides had caused the only previous closings in the waterways 
75year history 
panamanian forces attacked the us embassy causing light 
damage and the area was secured by us military personnel and 
vehicles about 430 am said a us embassy spokesman speaking on 
condition of anonymity 
the only tv channels operating were the us military network 
and a panamanian station that displayed a department of defense 
shield radio nacional claimed that defense forces had shot down a 
us helicopter 
the united states has tried to oust noriega with economic and 
political pressure since he was indicted on federal drug 
trafficking charges in february 1988 
bush was criticized for not ordering us troops to help the 
mutineers during the october coup attempt american soldiers 
blocked some routes to defense forces headquarters but not all 
and noriega loyalists rescued him 
on friday noriegas rubberstamp government declared the 
country was in a state of war with the united states and named 
the general head of state to deal with the threat a day later a 
us marine lieutenant was shot to death by panamanians in what 
american officials called an unprovoked attack 
american troops in panama had been on maximum alert and 
restricted to base since the lieutenant was killed saturday and an 
american navy couple was held and the woman threatened sexually 
on monday a us army officer wounded a panamanian policeman 
because he thought the man was about to draw a weapon according to 
the us southern command

after being extradited from austria on charges of running a major 
marijuana smuggling ring 
less than 24 hours after their extradition linda leary and 
richard and paul heilbrunn appeared in shackles tuesday before a 
us magistrate and were then jailed for a hearing friday on 
whether to free them on bail before trial feb 13 
the evidence well present will likely keep them detained 
us attorney deborah said 
a 1987 indictment named them among 34 people charged with 
operating an 11state ring that moved at least 250000 pounds of 
marijuana one of the biggest such drug operations ever uncovered

president of the indianapolis league of women voters and the local 
chapter of the national council of jewish women 
paul heilbrunn 35 was a commodities broker and columnist for a 
local business journal richard heilbrunn 38 lived with his wife 
and two children on a farm outside indianapolis 
this is a major milestone daniels said though we had 
felt confident that they would be home by the end of the year its 
good to see that process complete 
daniels and her staff waited for months while justice department 
officials in washington processed hundreds of pages of documents 
translated them into german and moved them through the state 
department to austria

the consumer product safety commission staff 
on wednesday recommended that the agency require childresistant 
containers for two cosmetic products that pose a risk of poisoning 
for young children who might accidentally swallow the preparations 
they can cause severe toxic effects in humans and pose a risk 
of serious injury or death to young children said virginia 
white a project manager in the cpscs chemical hazards program in 
testimony at a commission hearing 
white recommended the agency require special packaging for 
artificial fingernail glue removers containing acetonitrile and 
home permanent hairwave neutralizers with sodium or potassium 
bromate 
childresistant packaging is readily available and the 
costs for complying with a special packaging regulation are 
estimated to be low relative to the potential benefits she added 
the commission deferred voting on the package requirements but 
white said the procedural nature of commissioners questions 
indicated they would follow the staff recommendations and require 
the childproof containers 
acetonitrile is used as a solvent in liquids used by manicurists 
to remove artificial sculptured fingernails hobbyists in model 
building and as a general household glue remover 
material compiled by the agencys staff said a 16monthold 
california boy died in 1987 after swallowing up to two tablespoons 
of sculptured nail remover three other children under the age of 
five also were seriously injured after ingesting similar products 
containing acetonitrile the report said 
staff researchers found 17 cases one involving the death of a 
17monthold child and one that resulted in permanent hearing loss 
and kidney damage to a 16monthold of accidential ingestion of 
bromate neutralizers since 1947 
neutralizers are used to stop the action of chemicals used in 
permanent hairwave products 
preparations with sodium and potassium bromates were commonly 
used during the 1940s and 1950s but had virtually disappeared from 
the market after being replaced by products with alternative 
ingredients white said recently however several smaller 
manufacturers have again begun adding the bromates to neutralizers 
she said 
white said it would cost manufacturers of both types of products 
2 to 7 cents per package to add the containers child resistant 
more than 5 million in glue removers are sold for cosmetic and 
hobby use annually the staff materials said sales of permanent 
wave products including those containing bromates were put at 
1076 million in 1987 
the staff recommendation would require that any product 
containing acetonitrile be in a childresistant container 
both products are sold in supermarkets drug stores and retail 
and wholesale beauty supply outlets 
the american association of poison control centers inc had 
asked to commission to require the childresistant packaging the 
petition was supported by the cosmetic toiletry and fragrance 
association and the california department of health services 
wednesdays hearing was the first on product safety since 
jacqueline jonessmith became chairman of the panel last month the 
commission has been without a quorum for most of 1989 and could not 
meet to conduct official business

death rates for medicare patients were higher 
in 1988 than federal projections at 34 percent of the nations 
nearly 6000 hospitals the government said wednesday 
thirtytwo hospitals including six public hospitals in puerto 
rico have had higherthanprojected rates for three consecutive 
years four had fewer deaths than projected during the same period 
officials said 
however federal health officials cautioned that the report is 
not a direct measure of the quality of care and should not be 
used to judge hospitals as good or bad 
the report said 196 hospitals or 34 percent of us hospitals 
had higherthanexpected death rates in 1988 
that compares with 194 such hospitals in 1987 and 187 in 1986 
according to revised figures data for those years were recomputed 
to account for different risk factors added to the calculations of 
the 1988 projections 
at the other end of the scale 51 hospitals or 09 percent 
were found to have medicare death rates lower than projected 
applying the revised calculations such hospitals numbered 48 in 
1987 and 40 in 1986 
although the statistics were based solely on admissions of 
medicare patients officials said they believe the rates are 
reflective of the general population 
the information in the third annual report on medicare hospital 
patient death rates was compiled by the health care financing 
administration 
thomas morford director of the agencys health standards and 
quality bureau said it would be unfair and inaccurate to label the 
facilities whose death rates were outside the projected ranges as 
the nations best or worst hospitals 
this is not a onetoone measure of quality of care he said 
rather the information is intended to be one indicator of 
quality of care and consumers should use it to ask more informed 
questions when assessing a hospitals strengths and weaknesses he 
said 
the names of the 32 hospitals with repeatedly 
higherthanexpected death rates were released with the caveat that 
it does not necessarily mean that the care at these hospitals was 
substandard nor that these hospitals are the poorest performing 
acute care hospitals in the united states 
twenty of the hospitals are public facilities five are private 
nonprofit hospitals three are private forprofit and four are run 
by churches 
the four hospitals with repeatedly lower rates included two 
public hospitals and two private facilities one forprofit and one 
nonprofit 
asked about the significance that six puerto rican hospitals 
more than any one state have had repeatedly higher rates morford 
said at this point im not drawing anything from anything 
obviously we are going to make some inquiries as to the care at 
all 32 hospitals 
morford said martin luther king jr general hospital in los 
angeles is an example of a hospital that consistently exceeded 
projected death rates for medicare patients but recently improved 
conditions remarkably the hospital was told last year that it 
would no longer receive medicare reimbursement unless improvements 
were made 
though the los angeles hospital is on the list of 32 over the 
past three months they have done extraordinary things to bring 
themselves into compliance morford said 
in comments included in the report some hospitals took 
exception to the agencys projected ranges some noted data errors 
and others said the ranges dont adequately reflect that many of 
their patients are sicker when they arrive at the hospital and more 
likely to die 
for some hospitals death rates were less than 1 percentage 
point over the upper bound of the projected range 
the financing agency a unit of the department of health and 
human services said one of the studies it conducted using the 
reports data indicates that large urban hospitals and publicly 
owned hospitals are more likely to have quality problems and higher 
death rates than other hospitals 
as another measure of quality officials said a study by agency 
staff and researchers at the medical colleges of wisconsin shows 
that hospitals with a larger percentage of boardcertified 
physicians registered nurses higher payroll expenses and more 
access to hightechnology facilities are more likely to have lower 
mortality rates 
the hospital mortality report calculates the rates for all 
causes of medicare deaths as well as for each of 16 diagnostic 
categories including cancer heart disease and stroke it provides 
such general information as the number of beds interns residents 
and registered nurses as well as the types of specialty services 
offered 
medicare pays hospital and doctor bills for about 33 million 
americans who are over 65 blind or disabled

us ambassador thomas r pickering said 
wednesday the united states acted in selfdefense when it sent its 
military forces to panama to oust military leader gen manuel 
antonio noriega from power 
alejandro serrano caldera the ambassador of nicaragua which 
called for an emergency security council meeting retorted that 
the united states has no legal or ethical right to intervene in 
other countries affairs 
speaking outside the council chambers serrano caldera said the 
panamanian people have the right to selfdetermination this 
action by the united states violated the sovereignty of the 
panamanian people 
we want the council to call for an immediate withdrawal of the 
us troops serrano caldera said speaking in spanish 
nicaraguas un mission announced the sandinista government had 
declared a national alert and mobilized troops against what 
president daniel ortega said was washingtons serious threat 
against nicaragua 
security council ambassadors met individually in the morning and 
scheduled private consultations for the rest of the day it was 
unclear whether a formal public meeting would be held 
pickering said the united states had the right to intervene 
under article 51 of the un charter which provides for the use 
of armed force to defend a country to defend our interests and our 
people its the socalled selfdefense article 
panamanian soldiers shot and killed a us marine officer at a 
roadblock on saturday night 
panamas declaration last week that a state of war existed 
with the united states and the attacks on our citizens over the 
weekend are several of the things which the president has cited 
which required us to move in selfdefense pickering said 
article 51 of the charter permits the use of individual or 
collective selfdefense if an armed attack occurs against a member 
of the united nations until the security council has taken 
measures necessary to maintain international peace and security 
pickering said he was talking with council members and favored 
more consultations before any public meeting is held 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said president bush 
ordered us troops to seize noriega and bring him to the united 
states for trial on drug trafficking charges 
secretary of state james a baker iii informed secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar of the military moves at 2 am wednesday 
said the un chiefs spokesman francois giuliani 
perez de cuellar is extremely concerned about the crisis 
giuliani said 
panama repeatedly has come before the security council to 
complain of allegedly provocative us military maneuvers it said 
were intended to lay the groundwork for an invasion to topple the 
government 
in august panamanian foreign minister jorge ritter asked the 
council to send military observers to his country to prevent the 
us army from goading confrontations as a pretext for armed 
intervention 
un military observers said ritter will insure that the 
reality of the situation cannot be hidden and it will be recorded 
in the annals of history as a crime 
however panama did not have any nation on the council introduce 
a resolution to send observers a necessary step toward sending a 
mission 
panama said in april and august that the united states is trying 
to provoke confrontations in order to keep control of the panama 
canal under a 1977 treaty the united states is to turn over 
control of the canal to panama at the end of 1999

a group of 52 soviet teenagers who were 
exposed to radiation during the chernobyl nuclear accident arrived 
in israel on wednesday for a threeweek holiday 
the children guests of israels united kibbutz movement came 
under an agreement on youth exchanges signed by israels 
agriculture minister abraham katzoz in moscow this month 
katzoz and vice premier shimon peres were waiting at the ben 
gurion airport near tel aviv for the excited children brought by a 
special soviet aeroflot airlines flight from moscow 
we know what you have suffered and we all hope the warm sun of 
this country will be of benefit to you peres said what we 
the older people have lost you the young ones can regain by 
bringing understanding between our two peoples 
we shall pray that you should gain complete freedom you pray 
for us that we should achieve complete peace and we both shall 
pray for better understanding between our countries he said 
the soviet children aged 14 to 16 were also greeted by israeli 
youths of their own age from five kibbutzim or collective farms 
in the southern negev desert 
the young guests will spend several days in the negev and will 
also visit negevs capital of beersheba and the galilee 
agriculture ministry spokesman naftali yaniv said 
the soviet children are not suffering from any radiationrelated 
diseases following the april 1986 accident at chernobyl the worst 
ever involving a nuclear reactor but they will be under medical 
observation by local doctors and some may undergo closer checkups 
in israeli hospitals 
another group of 50 children from the chernobyl area is due to 
arrive in israel next year the exchange program would encompass 
1000 youths aged 15 to 17 from both countries 
this is only one of the agreements signed by katzoz yaniv 
said we hope that next week we can start to implement the second 
agreement on the supply of fresh israeli agricultural products to 
moscow region 
katzoz the first israeli minister to travel to moscow in at 
least 22 years was invited there by the soviet academy of sciences 
the 30 million agricultural agreement stipulates export of 
90000 tons of fresh fruits and vegetables to the moscow region 
which consumes 25 million tons a year a third party in return 
would sell soviet goods for hard currency and transfer the money to 
israel 
the soviet union cut diplomatic ties with israel following the 
1967 middle east war the countries exchanged lowlevel diplomatic 
missions in 198788 and are developing cultural and economic ties

lithuanian communists voted 
overwhelmingly wednesday to form an independent party breaking 
moscows iron political unity for the first time in soviet history 
the lithuanian partys congress of 1038 delegates voted to 
declare themselves an equal partner rather than a subordinate 
of the soviet communist party 
delegates at the vilnius opera and ballet theater stood for a 
sustained ovation after the vote result was announced 855 voted 
for independence with 160 for retaining subordination to the 
moscow party 
party chief algirdas brazauskas congratulated the congress and 
expressed the hope and wish that our party will always be 
resolute rejuvinated and ready for new battles 
the party declared in a resolution it would maintain relations 
of equal partnership with the soviet communist party other 
progressive parties public organizations and movements 
the major goals of the lithuanian communist party are an 
independent democratic lithuanian state implementation of the 
ideals of humanistic socialism liberty and social justice 
creation of adequate living conditions for the lithuanian people 
and all the inhabitants of lithuania the resolution said 
the break runs counter to more than 80 years of communist party 
practice and polcy since before the 1917 russian revolution 
vladimir i lenin demanded a unified party covering the entire 
territory of the czarist empire in 1921 the party formally 
outlawed the existence of factions 
the vote came after two days of tough exchanges between the 
majority seeking a break with moscow and the minority mostly 
ethnic slavs who opposed it 
i believe that the formation of this kind of independent party 
leads practically to its annihilation said stefanya 
serzhantovich a tractor driver from rural vilnius who is a 
congress delegate 
but brazauskas and other party leaders said such a split 
including drafting a separate party program was necessary for 
lithuanian communists to compete in feb 24 elections 
the communists who supported a legislative move dec 7 to 
strike the leading role of the party from the baltic republics 
constitution will have to compete with the grassroots political 
movement sajudis and other newly formed parties in the local 
elections 
president mikhail s gorbachev had appealed to the lithuanians 
most recently through party ideology chief vadim a medvedev not 
to split saying doing so would hurt his reform effort 
yegor k ligachev a conservative member of the ruling 
politburo said in moscow the lithuanian partys action is great 
trouble for the people and for the communists 
he said the lithuanians just do not realize yet what grief 
will descend 
lithuanian party documents set a goal of restoring the 
republics complete political independence something gorbachev has 
warned could upset the balance of a rapidly changing era 
lithuanias action was the latest in a series of radical steps 
taken by communist parties in eastern europe which have ended 
their monopoly on political power and allowed other parties to form 
writer raimondas kasauskas told the delegates that an 
independent lithuania was no danger to the soviet union just 
like the existence of a peaceful finland or denmark is not bad 
just like the changes in hungary dont mean anything bad 
it would be a disaster if the results of the voting would not 
meet the aspirations of the people he said 
arvydas matulionis of lithuanias institute of society 
philosophy and law told delegates 56 percent of local residents 
polled nov 30 approved of a separate communist party 
he said 61 percent of the party members polled approved of the 
idea 
sajudis observers say local communist parties in other republics 
such as latvia estonia georgia and armenia could follow 
lithuanias example soon and present gorbachev with a splintered 
party when he convenes the 28th national party congress next fall 
ethnic lithuanians make up about 80 percent of its 37 million 
people russians make up about 10 percent and there are smaller 
populations of poles and other ethnic groups

a jury today began deliberating whether 
larry mahoney is guilty of murder for each of the 27 people killed 
in a fiery 1987 collision between his pickup and a church bus 
the jury received the case after mahoneys lawyers contended in 
closing arguments that the bus was unsafe and that the factory 
worker is not responsible for the deaths prosecutor paul 
richwalsky countered that bus safety was not the issue adding 
the apologies are too late now its time to pay 
mahoney is charged with 27 counts of murder 12 of assault 42 
of wanton endangerment and one of drunkendriving in what 
authorities have called the nations deadliest alcoholrelated 
traffic accident 
twentyfour youngsters and three adults from a church group died 
in the fire that engulfed the former school bus after mahoneys 
pickup rammed it on interstate 71 five miles south of carrollton 
on may 14 1988 
the chassis of the 1977 school bus was made by ford motor co 
mahoneys attorneys argued during his murder trial that the bus was 
unsafe because of a vulnerable gas tank and combustible interior 
materials 
somebody should pay for it said jack hildebrand one of 
mahoneys three attorneys but larry mahoney should not have to 
pay for something ford motor company did 
hildebrand and another defense attorney william summers told 
the jury that mahoney was intoxicated and was driving on the wrong 
side of the interstate that caused the collision but not the fiery 
deaths they said 
larry has the rest of his life every waking minute to 
remember this summers said no one can do anything to punish 
him worse 
the prosecutor argued that mahoneys attorneys mounted an attack 
on the safety of the school bus out of desperation because no one 
could deny that mahoney caused the crash 
school buses dont have anything to do with it richwalsky 
said the elements of the alleged crime would be the same if 
mahoney had collided with a motorcycle or a family car 
the jury received instructions from judge charles satterwhite on 
tuesday 
satterwhite gave the jury two alternatives to the 27 murder 
charges seconddegree manslaughter punishable by five to 10 
years in prison and reckless homicide punishable by one to five 
years murder is punishable by 20 years to life 
to convict the 36yearold mahoney of murder the jury would 
have to find that he had acted with extreme indifference to the 
value of human life satterwhite told the panel 
richwalsky contended that mahoneys actions driving drunk and 
on the wrong side of a highway fit that description 
the defense has claimed that mahoney did not intentionally get 
drunk and that the former school bus manufactured by ford and 
shellerglobe corp was unsafe autopsies showed the fire not the 
crash killed the victims 
satterwhite told jurors they would be sequestered spending 
nights in a motel under sheriffs guard until reaching a verdict 
once sequestered jurors could not be released even for christmas 
the prosecutor said

secretary of state james a baker iii notified 
congress today that the us embassy in moscow will be torn down 
and a new one erected in its place 
the decision pending for months was based on us intelligence 
conclusions that the soviets had implanted sophisticated listening 
devices in the structure 
rep olympia snowe of maine said she was extremely pleased 
by the decision the ranking republican member of the house 
operations subcommittee she had concluded after inspecting the 
embassy in april 1987 that tearing it down was the best solution 
another option weighed by the state department was saving part 
of the building after demolishing areas thought to be infiltrated 
kirk walder spokesman for ms snowe said baker told her 
construction of a new embassy would be undertaken under stringent 
security safeguards and in full cooperation with intelligence 
agencies

in another time another president said he 
would not see the united states made into a pitiful helpless 
giant the phrase echoed as president bush ordered american 
troops to crush and capture gen manuel antonio noriega whose 
panamanian regime had withstood an arsenal of american sanctions 
short of force 
part of the mission was reported accomplished within eight hours 
on wednesday with the pentagon declaring that noriega had been 
decapitated as the strongarm leader of panama 
but he escaped and supporters claimed he was still directing his 
loyalist forces the united states called him a fugitive and said 
he would be tracked and taken to stand trial on us drug 
trafficking indictments 
for more than two years noriega had taunted and incited the 
giant while his foes at home and in washington tried futilely to 
dislodge his grip on power bush whose watchword is prudence said 
it was an enormous frustration but he took it for nearly a year 
for lack of an acceptable alternative 
then he took a risk and went to war fellow citizens last 
night i ordered us military forces to panama he told the 
nation wednesday i took this action only after reaching the 
conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of 
american citizens were in grave danger 
bush gained prompt and predictable support at home from 
democrats as well as republicans he had briefed congressional 
leaders just before us forces went into combat against noriegas 
loyalists in the panama defense forces 
presidents seldom face much political dissent when american 
forces are in combat especially with the kind of provocations 
noriega provided his puppet assembly had declared a state of war 
with the united states and an offduty american officer was shot 
and killed by his forces on saturday 
bush recounted the killing the wounding of another american 
serviceman the capture and beating of a third and threats against 
his wife 
that was enough the president said 
gen noriegas reckless threats and attacks upon americans in 
panama created an eminent danger to the 35000 american citizens in 
panama bush said and that is why i directed our armed 
forces to protect the lives of american citizens in panama and to 
bring gen noriega to justice in the united states 
bush had repeatedly encouraged noriegas opponents to kick him 
out of power he had said that noriega was the problem that the 
united states quarrel was with the general not with the panama 
defense forces and that his ouster would instantly restore normal 
diplomatic and economic relations 
yet when dissident pdf officers attempted a coup on oct 3 and 
briefly held noriega american forces stood by inactive us 
forces had blocked two roads and had conferred with coup leaders 
but the administration decided against intervention 
that drew protests from left and right although some 
republicans complained that dovish democrats who opposed 
intervention in other crises were endorsing it retroactively in 
panama 
secretary of state james a baker iii said us commanders had 
been told they could offer support for the coup if there were an 
opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and significant 
loss of american life and to do so without open military 
involvement 
those instructions ring with irony now that us forces have 
been sent into open combat 
on wednesday baker recalled his october testimony and the 
administration explanation of us inaction at the time of the coup 
attempt 
i said if this administration chose to use force it would 
make its own decisions he told a news conference it would not 
act based on some unknown coup plotters strategy or rationale 
at least 11 american soldiers were killed in action early 
wednesday others wounded 
that is the price of using military power it was richard m 
nixon who spoke of the price of shrinking from its use 19 years 
ago if when the chips are down the worlds most powerful 
nation the united states of america acts like a pitiful helpless 
giant the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free 
nations and free institutions throughout the world he said 
announcing he had sent forces to attack communist north vietnamese 
sanctuaries in cambodia 
bush ordered about 7000 troops into panama to join some 12000 
already stationed there as the panama canal garrison another 2500 
reinforcements were being deployed wednesday 
later there are sure to be toldyouso comments from those who 
argued the administration should have sent forces to join the 
october coup 
and noriegas purge of dissident pdf officers after that coup 
could make it more difficult for the united states to quickly 
complete operations and withdraw the additional troops which bush 
said he wants to do as quickly as possible 
the newlyinstalled government of panama led by guillermo 
endara thought to have won the may election noriega annulled 
will need reliable new leaders to take control of the military in 
place of his henchmen 
stability under an elected government will be the real test of 
success whatever happens to noriega the administration has been 
wagering all along that his support was thin and brittle american 
intervention puts that to the tes if the theory is correct and he 
is powerless noriega is irrelevant 
but if noriega or his lieutenants are capable of holding out and 
running continuing operations against us forces and the endara 
government the administration will have a major problem on its 
hands 
when president ronald reagan ordered american forces into action 
in the 1983 invasion of grenada and the 1986 air raid on libya the 
operations were swift and brief the bush administration wants 
intervention in panama to be a mission accomplished and quickly 
ended prolonged involvement would stir political opposition at 
home and intensify the inevitable latin american resentment against 
yankee intervention no matter the cause 
bush sought to ease that backlash by saying he wants to get out 
swiftly by lifting economic sanctions against panama under the new 
endara government and by promising anew that the united states 
will turn the canal over to panama at the end of the century

bombsniffing dogs and dozens of 
police provided security today at the funeral of a federal judge 
killed by a parcel bomb in a wave of attacks that may have been 
carried out by white racists 
more than 700 mourners including attorney general dick 
thornburgh and fbi director william s sessions filled a suburban 
church for the service in memory of us circuit judge robert vance 
vance was a man who stood up for the underdog and the 
oppressed his friend us bankruptcy judge clifford fulford of 
birmingham told mourners no wonder his assassins could not stand 
such a man in their presence 
the 58yearold vance was killed by a package bomb saturday fbi 
agents say the bomb and three others including the one that killed 
savannah ga lawyer robert robinson 42 on monday all bore 
georgia return addresses or postmarks 
links to naacp school desegregation efforts have been 
established in all four cases leading investigators to speculate 
that a white racist group may be responsible after police defused 
a bomb at an naacp office in jacksonville fla tuesday the 
organization placed all its offices on alert 
four anonymous letters mailed in august to declare war on 
various federal appeals courts are being examined for clues to the 
bombings fbi spokesman greg jones said today in washington 
st lukes episcopal church in a quiet area of this wooded 
exclusive suburb of birmingham was surrounded by police barriers 
as part of security precautions that included bomb searches and 
guards 
among those attending was supreme court justice anthony kennedy 
who oversees vances appellate circuit vances wife helen 
remained hospitalized from wounds received in the bombing 
family friends said vances body had been cremated and his ashes 
will be placed in the church 
in baltimore today naacp executive director benjamin hooks said 
the attacks will not prevent the naacp from moving forward full 
speed ahead on the job of trying to make america a place of equal 
justice for all 
i think its the work of white supremacists without any 
question i think it reveals the derangement demented criminally 
stupid minds hooks said 
hooks said he had been assured by sessions and thornburgh that 
the bombings were being given the highest priority 
william hinshaw agent in charge of the atlanta fbi office told 
the birmingham news in an interview published today that the deadly 
package addressed to vance was mailed thursday from newnan a town 
of about 11500 people 30 miles southwest of atlanta 
the bomb that killed robinson on monday is believed to have been 
mailed friday from macon 82 miles southeast of atlanta hinshaw 
said but the postmark was destroyed in the blast 
the atlanta constitution quoted unidentified sources as saying 
it bore a return address in warner robins a town near macon 
the bomb found tuesday in jacksonville also was mailed friday 
from macon hinshaw said a jacksonville naacp official lloyd n 
pearson told the macon telegraph and news the package bore the 
return address of a warner robins lawyer 
another device was mailed saturday from the atlanta area to the 
11th us circuit court of appeals clerks office in atlanta 
hinshaw said and the constitution reported it bore the return 
address of an atlanta lawyer the court on which vance served 
handled appeals of federal cases from georgia alabama and florida 
that bomb was removed safely all four bombs reportedly were 
designed to hurl nails or shrapnel 
sessions told reporters that some organized group could be 
responsible for the bombs he said a pattern of racist attacks 
has to be one of the factors in the back of all our minds 
common sense would tell you the number of incidents in 
three different states all part of the 11th circuit its quite 
possible there is more than one person responsible sessions 
said 
benjamin hooks executive director of the national association 
for the advancement of colored people said he believed an 
organized group was behind the attacks he instructed the civil 
rights groups 1800 offices to take precautions in handling mail 
hooks also said he fears the bombings were the beginning of a 
wave of attacks the thing has come to the place where everyone 
may be in jeopardy from the president on down 
one possible link between the cases was the naacps efforts to 
desegregate southern schools authorities said evidence included 
vance wrote the 11th circuits unanimous opinion three months 
ago that ruled in favor of the naacp in a desegregation suit 
against the jacksonville fla schools 
robinson a black city alderman represented the naacp in 
another desegregation case involving savannah area schools on 
sept 29 an 11th circuit panel that didnt include vance upheld a 
desegregation plan opposed by the naacp 
the jacksonsville naacp chapter talked with robinson about its 
desegregation case but robinson did not represent them he gave 
us some advice said the rev fred newbill pastor of the first 
timothy baptist church 
vance and robinson shared a moderatetoprogressive political 
stance and an interest in civil rights but friends of the two 
believed they had never met

national parks need special protection from 
air pollution that the environmental protection agency has failed 
to provide an oregon lawmaker said wednesday in calling for a 
special amendment to the clean air act 
manmade pollution is creeping into our parks and wildernesses 
robbing us of what makes them special rep ron wyden dore 
said at a news conference he was joined by former arizona gov 
bruce babbitt 
the problem is especially acute in the open spaces of the west 
which scientists believe are particularly vulnerable to sulfur 
dioxide and other pollutants he said 
the problem has gotten so bad he said later in an interview 
that polluted air has become as much a health problem as a 
visibility problem he said it is affecting visibility at airports 
observatories on isolated peaks and military testing grounds 
federal officials have a choice either clean up our parks or 
adopt rules to warn americans of health problems they may face from 
visiting polluted parks he said 
the 1977 clean air act contains a provision to protect the 
national park system against visual pollution but wyden said epa 
has concentrated only on the simple problem of plume blight 
pollution from a few distinct sources near the park 
wyden said he would try to amend the act in the energy and 
commerce committee early next year the senate will be taking up 
its version of the bill as its top priority in 1990 
wydens proposal would require epa to identify sources of 
emissions provide for federal implementation of controls if states 
do not act broaden the categories of areas protected and give 
federal park and wilderness officials earlier notice of permit 
applications

an appeals court wednesday reviewed 
evidence against a palestinian suspect in the pan am flight 103 
bombing amid heightened security for the first anniversary of the 
disaster 
another court in uppsala will announce its verdict thursday 
against the palestinian mohammed abu talb on separate charges of 
murder and attempted murder for bombs directed against us and 
jewish targets in northern europe in 1985 and 1986 
abu talb faces a maximum life sentence which in sweden means 20 
years or less if convicted he still could be extradited to stand 
trial in a foreign country on charges related to the dec 21 1988 
explosion over lockerbie scotland legal experts said 
scottish detectives questioned abu talb in the flight 103 case 
tuesday but the swedish news agency tt reported that he refused to 
cooperate 
abu talb was charged on one count of murder in the death of a 
passerby from a bomb outside the northwest orient airline office in 
copenhagen in 1985 he was accused in other bombings in amsterdam 
and stockholm 
the 35yearold former egyptian army soldier and member of the 
palestine popular struggle front has lived in sweden for six years 
as friends and relatives of the 270 people killed on flight 103 
gathered in lockerbie for the anniversary of the bombing 
antiterrorism experts in sweden warned of possible attacks 
thursday to mark the occasion 
they said a guilty verdict by the uppsala court could increase 
the risk of a vengeance attack tougher security checks were being 
imposed in airports around sweden tt said 
foreign minister sten andersson who has been active in middle 
east diplomacy for the last two years took a charter plane for his 
travels in europe and was assigned extra bodyguards the 
aftonbladet newspaper reported 
suspicion of a link to the flight 103 case arose when it was 
established that abu talb visited malta before the bombing he is 
believed to possess clothing from the same store to which 
detectives traced clothes from the bombrigged suitcase 
according to one theory the bomb was brought from malta to 
frankfurt where it was loaded onto flight 103 
the stockholm appeals court was reviewing the legality of the 
seizure of clothing nov 27 from abu talbs home in uppsala a 
university town north of stockholm 
an uppsala court had approved the removal of 15 bags of clothing 
and authorized the scottish police to take the evidence to britain 
for analysis abu talbs lawyer appealed the decision 
tt said the court was weighing whether the suspicions against 
abu talb justified upholding the lower courts ruling

the invasion of panama by american troops is 
the latest in nearly 20 episodes over the past 150 years in which 
the united states has used its military might in latin america and 
the caribbean 
prior to the action in panama the most recent outright use of 
us force in the region was six years ago on oct 25 1983 when 
us forces led an invasion of the island of grenada 
thenpresident reagan said his aim was to rescue american students 
and to end cuban use of the caribbean nation as a training ground 
for terrorists 
in april 1965 president johnson sent us troops to the 
dominican republic after rebels tried to seize power johnson said 
he was acting to protect us citizens and to prevent communists 
from taking power some members of the organization of american 
states also sent troops a truce was signed a month after the us 
forces arrived and all were withdrawn by september 1966 
us marines also had occupied the dominican republic from 
19161924 to keep order among rival political factions 
short of combat troops in recent years were stationed at the 
panama canal and military advisers were sent to honduras and el 
salvador to train the military forces of friendly central american 
governments the united states has also supported the contra rebels 
seeking to oust the sandinista government in nicaragua 
support for the contras is the latest phase in a long saga of 
us involvement in nicaragua about 2500 marines were sent in 
1912 to protect the government and about 100 of them remained for 
13 years 
the united states also sent gunboats and troops to nicaragua in 
1926 to help the government during a rebellion led by gen augusto 
cesar sandino us planes bombed guerilla strongholds eventually 
forcing sandino to flee to mexico the us troops withdrew in 
early 1933 
further back in history two episodes helped make the 
reputations of future us presidents gen zachary taylors 
capture of buena vista in the mexican war and theodore roosevelts 
charge up san juan hill in the spanishamerican war in 1961 
president john f kennedys administration would be shaken after 
us failure to deliver military backing to cuban exiles seeking to 
foster revolution in their homeland 
it was more than 80 years ago when us troops first landed in 
panama 
then the troops were deployed to support a fledgling panamanian 
government that had revolted against colombian rule in late 1903 
the united states had failed to convince colombia to support the 
panama canal project but the new panamanian government endorsed it 
beginning the us presence in the southernmost country of central 
america 
that first use of american military power in panama came nearly 
50 years after us troops ventured onto latin american soil in a 
war with mexico 
a decade after texans revolted against the mexican government 
us soldiers crossed into mexico in 1846 beginning a war that 
gave the united states land that is now california nevada utah 
and parts of arizona and new mexico 
americans ultimately occupied much of mexico and the war brought 
fame to zachary taylor whose forces won the battle of buena vista 
in 1847 that victory catapulted taylor to the presidency and the 
war ended in 1848 
it would be 67 years before us troops again invaded mexico 
this time to seize the shipping port veracruz after us sailors 
were arrested in tampico president woodrow wilson ordered the 1914 
seizure to block arms shipments to mexican forces 
in 1916 gen john j pershing was sent into mexico in an 
unsuccessful bid to capture revolutionary leader francisco pancho 
villa blamed for the deaths of 16 americans during an incursion 
into columbus nm 
wilson also set us marines to quell political unrest in haiti 
in 1915 they remained until 1934 
it was the spanishamerican war of 1898 that brought us forces 
to cuba and puerto rico 
the us battleship maine was off the coast of cuba when it 
mysteriously exploded in february 1898 president william mckinley 
who had sent the ship there to protect us interests in cuba 
during an uprising against spanish rule blamed spain for the 
explosion and declared war 
five months later us troops landed in puerto rico then 
controlled by spain theodore roosevelts exploits at san juan hill 
helped set him on the road to the presidency 
puerto rico would later become a us commonwealth cuba would 
experience a period of turmoil that intermittently involved us 
forces 
most american troops left cuba in 1902 after elections and an 
agreement with the cuban government for a lease for a us naval 
base at guantanamo bay the us forces would return four years 
later because opposition to the elected government had turned into 
open rebellion 
american troops left cuba again in 1909 after a new government 
was elected but returned in 1917 to protect american companies and 
citizens during yet another uprising 
cubas turmoil would continue through dictatorships and the rise 
to power of fidel castro in january 1959 
two years later president john f kennedy refused to commit 
us assistance to a group of cuban exiles seeking to oust castro 
by invading at the bay of pigs on cubas south coast the exiles 
had been promised us assistance and the episode proved a major 
embarrassment for the kennedy administration 
nineteen months later kennedy imposed a naval blockade of cuba 
during the 1962 missile crisis stationing us vessels off cuba 
until the soviet union agreed to withdraw its missiles from cuba

us helicopter gunships and fighter 
jets thundered through the hot moonlit night toward the caldron of 
light surrounding gen manuel antonio noriegas headquarters 
they whined overhead before diving toward the strongmans 
compound two miles east of the diablo heights promontory 
overlooking the panama canal 
armored personnel carriers and truckloads of soldiers roared out 
of us army bases on the roads below surrounding the compound 
with the crackle of machine guns the cough of mortars and the 
heavy thump of cannon 
the sky blazed with tracer fire and eventually glowed with the 
light of a giant fire 
daybreak revealed the compound reduced to rubble with only 
scattered shots still being fired a pall of acrid smoke spread 
slowly over the city as scores of dazed survivors fled their homes 
in surrounding residential neighborhoods 
hundreds of refugees men women and children could be seen 
in the street walking in the tropical morning to churches 
hospitals and schools in search of safety 
during the day the city turned into a scene of chaos armed 
toughs who support noriega took to the streets some of them 
commandeering cars one resident said her car was stolen when a man 
put a gun to her head and demanded the keys 
shortly before noon the looting began even though sporadic 
shooting continued all over the panamanian capital there were 
dozens of people breaking into supermarkets and stores and making 
off with whatever they could lay their hands on 
most of the looters were just poor people from the slums off 
they went with stacks of food cameras home appliances tv sets 
mattresses and clothes 
although a few scattered shots could be heard here and there a 
festive atmosphere reigned as people walked away with food tires 
even refrigerators and stoves carried by four or five people at a 
time 
the major afternoon fighting however came in the san miguelito 
neighborhood to the northeast a stronghold of the civilian 
dignity battalions that noriega had set up to help enforce his 
rule 
attack jets bombed and helicopters strafed a defense forces 
barracks on top of san miguelito and once again came the refugees 
fleeing on foot or in their cars if they could 
at dozens of us army checkpoints those who wanted to pass had 
to get out of their cars and drop to their knees while the vehicle 
was thoroughly searched 
us soldiers herded together about 300 panamanian prisoners in 
a field near albrook air base at the foot of diablo heights 
relatives and friends of the captives waited across the street 
many of the prisoners had been taken in raids on houses in 
diablo heights a panamanian neighborhood jeeps with mounted 
machine guns had swept through the neighborhood during the night 
stopping at certain houses and taking the men prisoner 
in one house where four reporters were hiding along with the 
residents the owner said he had nothing to fear until his wife 
noticed an 8by10 color photo of her husband as a student shaking 
hands with none other than cuban president fidel castro 
she swiftly hid the photo potentially offensive to american 
eyes in their bedroom

journalists confidential sources and 
information they gathered must be highly material and relevant 
and unavailable from elsewhere before reporters can be compelled 
to reveal them the state supreme court has ruled 
the 50 ruling released wednesday overturned contempt citations 
against two west virginia reporters 
in september circuit judge patrick g henry iii held in 
contempt reporters ron hudok of the evening journal of martinsburg 
and natasha singh of wxvafm in charles town they had refused to 
testify at a hearing about circuit judge thomas steptoe jrs 
decision to fire an employee 
in this case the information sought to be obtained was 
tenuous at best to the main purpose of the hearing which was to 
provide the employee a hearing on her discharge the supreme 
court said 
eight news media groups including the associated press and the 
west virginia broadcasters association had filed a legal brief in 
support of the newspaper and radio station 
the decision is really a victory for the people of west 
virginia because it allows reporters for all media to write the 
comments and viewpoints of the people who live in this state 
said page burdette editor of the evening journal 
burdette said he hopes the issue will prompt lawmakers to pass 
west virginias first shield laws for reporters such 
legislation would help journalists protect news sources to whom 
theyve promised anonymity in return for information 
singh said she was relieved im just glad i get to eat turkey 
at christmas and i dont have to be in jail she said 
the opinion written by justice thomas miller said there could 
be cases when reporters information is pertinent to a legal 
proceeding in the case of hudok and singh however first 
amendment privilege should prevail the opinion said 
the case stemmed from steptoes decision to fire magistrate 
clerk linda butner in june the judge said she publicly injected 
herself into a criminal matter pending before magistrate court by 
talking to reporters 
steptoe had sought to force the reporters to testify about their 
conversations with butner who henry said is bound by judicial

then broadcast warnings to soldiers at a nearby military 
headquarters to leave the building

had no problem with them they just wanted noriega he said in a 
telephone interview from panama through an interpreter 
then the shooting began in panama city fires triggered by the 
battle leveled turnofthe century wooden homes in a threeblock 
area diaz who escaped with 11 members of his extended family 
said he counted six bodies of those loyal to noriega lying dead in 
the streets as he and others fled the immediate area 
many ended up at the nearby salvation army office 
they were carrying tvs and their belongings on their heads 
marjorie wiltshire whose husband heads the office said in a

the salvation army offered refugees from the fighting cookies 
and punch the only food available then began cooking lentils 
and rice for a midday meal thats all we have we cant get out 
to get to a store mrs wiltshire said 
diaz and his family were escorted by us soldiers to a church 
where they took shelter for about five hours until the church was 
hit by an incendiary device

a senior red cross official flew to geneva 
on wednesday after failing to arrange an immediate swap of ailing 
and wounded prisoners held by iran and iraq more than a year after 
their ceasefire 
angelo gnadinger the middle east chief of the genevabased 
international committee of the red cross ended his visit after 
five days of talks in the iraqi capital 
he held similar meetings last week in tehran with iranian 
officials seeking the repatriation of 1000 wounded and ailing 
prisoners held by both sides 
gnadinger refused to comment to reporters on the outcome of his 
visit before his departure 
but andreas wigger the chief red cross delegate in baghdad 
said i may say nothing concrete has been achieved this is a 
long process which needs more effort 
gnadinger had hoped for an immediate release of the sick and 
wounded as a first step toward settling the issue of the iranian 
and iraqi prisoners of war under article 118 of the third geneva 
convention the article calls for repatriation of pows immediately 
after hostilities cease 
the red cross has registered some 50000 prisoners held by iran 
and more than 19500 in iraqi camps many of the pows have been 
held since the early stages of the war that broke out in september 
1980 
however diplomats and united nations officials say the two 
sides hold 100000 pows between them 
last year iran and iraq released about 400 sick and wounded 
prisoners but the operation was stopped when both sides accused 
the other of falsifying the number of captives seeking asylum 
earlier this week hopes were raised that an agreement for a 
prisoner swap was imminent akram alwitri chief of the legal 
department at the iraqi foreign ministry said baghdad had 
responded positively to a red cross call to this effect 
but iranian foreign minister ali akbar velayati quickly 
reiterated the iranian position undermining the effort tehran has 
insisted it will not agree to swap the prisoners or implement any 
other peace move with iraq until iraqi troops withdraw from land 
they occupied in the final weeks of the war 
a unsponsored ceasefire halted hostilities on aug 20 1988 
but peace talks have been deadlocked mainly over the withdrawal 
issue and iraqs demand for a border demarcation accord that gives 
it sovereignty over the entire shattalarab waterway 
the channel a confluence of the great tigris and euphrates 
rivers is iraqs sole gateway to the gulf before the war the 
border ran down the middle of shattalarab

members of congress in both parties rallied 
behind the presidents decision to invade panama with most saying 
he had little choice though there were scattered objections 
i support the presidents decision said senate majority 
leader george mitchell dmaine who has been among bushs harshest 
critics on other foreign policy matters it was made necessary by 
the reckless actions of general manuel antonio noriega 
there was a small core of harsh dissent with one lawmaker 
calling bushs action a triggerhappy act of gunboat diplomacy 
and saying the move rested on shaky legal ground but for the most 
part members of congress welcomed the restoration of a democratic 
government and said all other possibilities had been exhausted 
its an action the president determined and i think under the 
circumstances congress will support his position said house 
speaker thomas s foley dwash american troops are in the field 
and casualties are being taken under these circumstances its not 
the proper time for a lot of complicated debate 
foley said he expressed some concerns when bush called about 
10 pm tuesday to inform him of the impending operation but 
foley added the concerns dont qualify my support for the 
presidents action 
the white house informed the top four leaders of the house and 
senate of the planned assault just before it was launched late 
tuesday and contacted other key members of congress once the 
operation was under way 
sen richard lugar rind a senior foreign relations committee 
member called the action an overwhelming success because 
democracy has now been inaugurated and installed in panama 
lugar also called the operation a very important moment in the 
presidency of george bush it is a time when the president asserted 
his own leadership and did so effectively 
rep lee hamilton dind said the action was justified 
weve had a long period of provocation by noriega hamilton 
said you can only go so long with this provocation this 
pushing this harassment he crossed over the line it backfired on 
him i think hes a cornered tiger 
a rare dissent came from the chairman of the foreign relations 
committee sen claiborne pell dri who said the threat to the 
canal was less than clear and bush did not adequately inform us 
allies in central america 
personally unless very clear evidence emerges of a direct 
threat against the panama canal or against american people or 
installations i would not have engaged in such unilateral or such 
goitalone action pell said 
but he said he would support the administration until the 
operation was completed and hoped for as few deaths as possible 
among us forces 
rep don edwards dcalif harshly criticized bushs action 
calling it a triggerhappy act of gunboat diplomacy that 
continues our mindless 100year abuse of small central american 
nations 
edwards chairman of the house judiciary subcommittee on the 
constitution said bush had violated the provision that requires 
congress consent to go to war 
there was no danger to our national security from this weak 
small country nor was the panama canal in real peril he said 
however the consensus on capitol hill was that bush had 
exhausted diplomatic efforts and economic pressure and was left 
with little alternative after noriegas public declaration of war 
against the united states last week 
sen christopher dodd dconn chairman of the foreign 
relations western hemisphere subcommittee said the lack of 
immediate criticism from latin american governments was testimony 
to bushs earlier diplomatic efforts through the organization of 
american states and other groups 
the reaction is one of silence and that would have to be 
interpreted as benign support at this point dodd said if we 
end up having to be the security blanket for the new government and 
you have a divided panamanian public then i think that support 
would turn into criticism 
senate republican leader bob dole of kansas said the panama 
operation erases criticism by democrats that bush has been overly 
timid in dealing with panama and other critical foreign policy 
issues 
i think what it says politically is that george bush keeps his 
own counsel and makes his own decisions dole told reporters 
sen carl levin dmich a member of the senate armed services 
committee endorsed bushs decision and praised the action as a 
blow against the international drug trade 
manuel noriega had explicitly declared war on us and on his 
own people he killed an unarmed us citizen and had brutalized 
others levin said the president has protected american lives 
in panama and has struck a blow against the international drug 
trade 
some lawmakers expressed concern about whether the panamanian 
military could be purged of those who aided noriega in drug 
trafficking and won over to support the new government 
rep david obey dwis said the united states should try to 
freeze the millions of dollars noriega has reportedly accumulated 
as a result of his drug involvement 
noriega was like a cancer said rep bill richardson 
dnm a member of the house intelligence committee he was 
making us a laughingstock he was baiting us he was threatening 
american lives we had no choice

air traffic controllers at 14 facilities near 
the east and west coasts give their operations the lowest marks for 
safety and other concerns a congressional report said wednesday 
the report by the general accounting office ranked controller 
operations around the country according to responses from federal 
aviation administration controllers to an extensive 1988 survey 
the survey showed widespread concern over operations of the system 
that guides all aircraft over the united states 
a significant number of the 5000 faa controllers who responded 
anonymously saw problems eightyfive percent perceived a shortage 
of fully qualified controllers 65 percent said they handled too 
much traffic in peak hours a majority were concerned about the 
quality of training and 43 percent said their morale was low 
the aggregate results of the survey had been previously 
released but the new report ranked 84 facilities according to the 
percentage of employees giving negative responses on each of 
several key questions 
it says boston and washington faa centers had the most negative 
responses on key questions of workload facility staffing 
overtime training safety and morale while centers in 
albuquerque houston and minneapolis had the fewest 
twelve airport facilities with the most negative responses were 
baltimorewashington boston burbank calif kennedy tower ny 
miami new york traffic control center oakland calif ontario 
calif traffic control center orlando fla philadelphia 
phoenix traffic control center and washington national 
those with the fewest negative responses were cleveland hebron 
ky jacksonville fla lubbock texas milwaukee minneapolis 
phoenix airport sacramento calif st louis traffic control 
center tampa fla and west palm beach fla 
all other surveyed facilities fell into a middle category with 
a mix of negative and positive responses to the six key questions 
the faa should be asking people at the lowestrated centers 
why they think their center is performing so poorly said rep 
guy molinari rny who released the gao rankings 
molinari who is leaving congress at the end of the year to 
become borough president in staten island ny said controllerss 
views should be key to resolving the chronic problems in the air 
traffic control system 
he said highranking centers and terminals also should be 
studied to see why employees rate them so well 
kenneth mead gao director for transportation issues said the 
report has been well received by the faa and should be a useful 
tool in improving operations 
in response to the report the faa said its system is safe and 
improvements have been made since the survey was taken including 
an increase in the number of controllers by about 400 to 14822 as 
of nov 30 
the gao data is not fully consistent with results of our own 
surveys which show continuing improvements in job satisfaction 
areas spokesman john leyden said the faa surveyed employees in 
1984 1986 and 1988 he said 
leyden said however the agency would use the gao data to see 
if theres any new information here to help us improve the system

tennessees secretary of state whose 
office has been at the center of a bingo and political corruption 
scandal died today more than a week after shooting himself in the 
head 
gentry crowell 57 died at vanderbilt university medical 
center said hospital spokesman wayne hood the onetime 
legislative power broker shot himself dec 12 in a suicide attempt 
on the front porch of his lebanon home 
as secretary of state he was in charge of regulating bingo and 
spending by lobbyists and political campaigns all of which were 
involved in a federalstate investigation that has resulted in 22 
people being indicted or pleading guilty since january 
crowell testified in september and november before federal grand 
juries investigating bingo corruption in tennessee he said he was 
told by federal agents that he was not a target of the 
investigation 
last week however the nashville banner quoted unidentified 
sources as saying that federal investigaors were focusing on how 
crowell solicited campaign money from architects engineers and 
bingo operators 
as a result of the probe one former crowell aide former chief 
bingo inspector wd donnie walker has gone to federal prison 
for offenses incliding including extorting payoffs from bingo 
operators his longtime administrative assistant and secretary 
mary sue wright has been named an unindicted coconspirator she 
admitted taking thousands of dollars from a campaign fund 
controversy much of it growing out of crowells passionate 
devotion to the democratic party followed him during most of his 
18 years in state government 
he was once known as the godfather on capitol hill because of 
his absolute partisan control over legislation in the dual roles 
of chairman of the house democratic caucus and house calendar 
committee 
the secretary of states office had regulated charitable bingo 
since it was legalized for charity fundraising in 1971 in 1989 
the state supreme court ruled bingo unconstitutional

britain said wednesday it will give special 
residence rights to an estimated 225000 hong kong chinese to 
prevent a crippling brain drain in the colony before it reverts to 
china in 1997 
rightwing legislators in the governing conservative party 
threatened a parliamentary rebellion against what one called an 
appalling wave of immigration the opposition labor party condemned 
the plan 
foreign secretary douglas hurd told the house of commons that a 
maximum of 50000 key people in hong kongs public and private 
sector would be given full british citizenship along with their 
families he estimated the total at 225000 people 
giving key people in government business and the professions 
the right to live in britain was essential to persuade them to 
remain in hong kong and ensure that it passes successfully 
through the final eight years of british rule he said 
the confidence of hong kongs 6 million residents was at a low 
ebb and the hemorrhage of talent was increasing putting the 
competitiveness of its economy at risk hurd said this year 
42000 people left and 55000 are expected to leave next year 
many of those who are leaving would not do so if they could 
obtain the assurance of right of abode in the united kingdom he 
said 
britain therefore decided to offer full british citizenship to a 
maximum 50000 key people from many walks of life who will be 
selected on a points system hurd said an estimated 1500 
families of indian descent will be included 
the decisive criteria will be the value of the individuals 
service to hong kong and the extent to which people in their 
category of employment are emigrating hurd said 
he said long service with british institutions and knowledge of 
english would be taken into account 
about 325 million hong kong chinese have british passports but 
no residence rights 
hurd said giving all of them the right to live in britain would 
create unacceptable strains here while giving residency to just 
a few wouldnt solve hong kongs problem and might make it worse 
in hong kong the government welcomed the package though 
governor sir david wilson several legislators said they would have 
preferred full passports for all british nationals wilson said the 
package was not solely for the elite and would help create the 
stability the colony needed 
but former conservative party chairman norman tebbit the 
ringleader of an estimated 50 tory rebels icily told the foreign 
secretary he disagreed with almost everything you said 
he demanded does the pledge that we have given for the last 
four general elections that there would be no further large scale 
immigration still stand or not 
hurd retorted the aim was to persuade key people to stay in hong 
kong but even if many of them did emigrate britain would gain 
professional talent and expertise from one of the worlds most 
successful societies 
this is the last main chapter in the story of this countrys 
empire i am rather keen and im sure you are rather keen that 
the last chapter should not end in a shabby way he said 
conservative lawmaker terry dicks called the decision 
appalling and a guaranteed voteloser in the next election 
which must be held by june 1992 
fellow conservative tony marlow said many people would never 
forgive the government for opening the door to further immigration 
in overcrowded britain 
they feel a deep resentment after a generation that imposed 
immigration into this country i believe you will not be 
forgiven he said 
labor lawmaker diane abbott the first black woman elected to 
parliament accused marlow of holding views similar to former 
conservative legislator enoch powell who opposed black immigration 
speaking in mr marlows words as an imposed immigrant and an 
mp she noted that people outside the house have listened with 
mounting incredulity while elements in the tory backbenches have 
outbid each other with subpowellite rhetoric on this subject 
she said britain must withdraw from hong kong with honor and 
not in the shabby and shameful way some members are trying to 
create an issue of an imminent yellow peril 
labors foreign affairs spokesman gerald kaufman called the plan 
unreasonable unworkable invidious and divisive 
laborite keith vaz said the plan represented one law for the 
rich and another for the poor

the bush administration carried out secret 
contacts with a lawyer for panamas gen manuel antonio noriega as 
recently as last month in hope of persuading noriega to step down 
the state department said wednesday 
the contacts were disclosed in a state department fact sheet 
outlining us diplomatic efforts to resolve panamas political 
crisis 
the lawyer who was not identified told bush administration 
officials in october he was authorized to discuss noriegas 
departure after the us officials ask for a specific proposal 
the attorney promised to consult with noriega and return in a week 
but last month noriegas lawyer advised the us officials 
that he had been unsuccessful in obtaining any flexibility from 
noriega and said he was under instructions to have no further 
contacts with the administration according to the fact sheet 
in early 1988 after noriega was indicted on drug trafficking 
charges the state department had attempted to negotiate his 
departure from panama but he suspended the talks at the last moment 
just when it seemed an agreement was within reach 
that proposal called for noriega to leave panama in august 1988 
and for steps toward the restoration of democratic rule

urban hunger and homelessness rose most 
rapidly this year among families with children the nations mayors 
said wednesday with boston mayor ray flynn telling reporters that 
increasingly the face of hunger is the face of the young child 
he released a survey of 27 cities by the us conference of 
mayors that said many cities had so many requests for help that 
they had to turn away families and others seeking shelter 
requests for emergency shelter were up 25 percent requests for 
food were up 19 percent 
one in four homeless people was a child almost twothirds of 
those seeking food were children or their parents 
the organization of bigcity mayors based its report on a survey 
of officials in 27 cities who reported on public and private 
relief efforts the cities ranged from the nations largest new 
york and los angeles to charleston sc with a population of 
81000 
the report found a shifting composition of the nations urban 
homeless toward families with children 
families made up 36 percent of the survey cities homeless in 
1989 up from 34 percent a year ago and 27 percent in 1985 the 
percentage of homeless who are single men continued to fall from 
60 percent in 1985 to 46 percent in 1989 
democrats cited the report released annually by the 
organization of bigcity mayors as evidence of neglect of the poor 
by the republican white house 
rep tony hall dohio chairman of the house select committee 
on hunger said the repoort demonstrated a tragic ending for the 
decade and an embarrassing legacy for the present and previous 
administrations 
flynn a democrat said increased urban misery was a consequence 
of congressional inattention as well as reagan and bush 
administration policies 
it has not been the politically fashionable thing up on 
capitol hill to help poor people said flynn who heads the 
mayors task force on hunger and homelessness i dont see how 
they can turn their backs and walk away any longer 
the conference which has reported rising hunger and 
homelessness annually for five years said there was a sharp 
increase in the percentage of the homeless population that abused 
drugs and alcohol these accounted from 44 percent of the homeless 
population up from 34 percent last year 
the increased requests for help were found in nearly all the 
cities surveyed 
the number of families with children requesting emergency food 
assistance increased an average 14 percent and was up in nine of 
10 cities nearly twothirds of the requests for food were from 
children or their parents 
the lack of affordable housing was cited as a leading cause of 
both hunger and homelessness 
flynn said that the poor who have homes paying increasingly 
large portions of their incomes for housing often have less money 
left for food and other necessities 
the survey said that threefourths of the cities could not meet 
all the demands for food and had to turn people away an average 
of 17 percent of their requests 
while theres a lot of things going on at the local level 
shelters soup kitchens the problem continues to grow and 
grow and grow flynn said 
onequarter of the requests for shelter by homeless families go 
unmet the survey found three out of four of the cities said 
shelters must turn away homeless families because of the lack of 
resources 
on average the study said the composition of the cities 
homeless population is 46 percent single men 36 percent families 
with children 14 percent single women and 4 percent young people 
on their own blacks made up 51 percent whites 35 percent 
a quarter of the homeless were veterans and a quarter were 
severely mentally ill 
the cities surveyed were alexandria va boston charleston 
sc charlotte nc chicago cleveland denver kansas city 
mo los angeles louisville ky minneapolis nashville tenn 
new orleans new york norfolk va philadelphia phoenix ariz 
portland ore providence ri st paul minn san antonio 
texas san diego san francisco santa monica calif seattle

left the court 
israel radio reported a palestinian prisoner in the custody of 
the shin bet secret service was found dead tuesday night in his 
cell arab reporters identified him as khaled kamel alsheikh ali 
27 of gaza city and said he was taken for questioning dec 7 
as a new step against the uprising the army spokesmans office 
said the army would begin confiscating property of palestinian 
parents who failed to cover the bail and fines of their children 
in bethlehem in the occupied west bank a leaflet signed by the 
plobacked uprising leadership called for a general strike on dec 
24 to mourn the deaths of the 631 palestinians killed by israeli 
soldiers and civilians in the revolt 
fortythree israelis also have been slain and 161 other 
palestinians have been killed by fellow arabs as alleged 
collaborators with israel 
on wednesday 14 palestinians were shot and wounded in scattered 
stonethrowing clashes with israeli soldiers in the occupied gaza 
strip arab hospital officials said 
monsignor michel sabbah the roman catholic patriarch called 
for peace in the holy land in his traditional christmas message 
peace on earth is possible only when all people and all states 
concerned recognize the legitimate rights of all individuals and 
nations to freedom and selfdetermination 
the study on the uprising in the jaffee centers annual middle 
east military balance was based on army figures and conducted by 
aryeh shalev a retired army brigadier general who served as 
military governor of the west bank in 197678 
what i discovered is there was no reduction in the number of 
incidents shalev told a news conference it means to my mind 
that such measures didnt have a serious effect on the strength 
of the intefadeh uprising in arabic 
since the uprising began in december 1987 army figures show 244 
houses have been destroyed and 116 sealed but shalev said they led 
to no decrease in violence as claimed by army commanders 
we found no correlation whatsoever between the number of 
houses demolisehd and the number of violent incidents recorded or 
the number of israeli casualties or even the number of petrol 
bombs thrown in the following month shalev wrote 
in fact his study showed the number of incidents increased 
after the heaviest periods of house demolitions for example 24 
houses were destroyed in november 1988 and incidents of stone 
throwing barricade building and rioting rose by 1195 or about 74 
percent to 2790 in the following month 
deportation of palestinian activists has been considered the 
most severe measure against the uprising but shalev said it proved 
impotent as a deterrent and actually inflamed the situation 
there is a clear correlation between the number of residents 
deported and an ensuing increase in the number of violent 
incidents and israeli casualties he said 
in april 1988 16 palestinians were deported the largest number 
in a single month but the number of violent incidents rose by 210 
he said adding there was a similar rise after 13 deportations in 
january 1989 
in all 60 palestinians were deported in the past two years 
shalev said closing schools initially appeared to have a 
restraining effect on violence in early 1988 but he said 
subsequent closures failed to have an effect and by early 1989 
seemed to accelerate incidents 
universities have been closed since the start of the uprising 
elementary junior and high schools were closed in the west bank 
for eights months in 1988 and throughout the first half of 1989 
i dont think it is possible to stop the intefadeh uprising 
by using these or other means shalev told a news conference 
here adding the only solution was a negotiated political 
settlement 
shalev suggested mass deportations and demolitions might reduce 
violence but said such practice would not be possible because of 
legal and moral restaints

the soviet union on wednesday branded the us 
military attack in panama gunboat diplomacy and a violation of 
international law it called for an immediate end to the operation 
however a soviet official played down any impact the us 
action might have on improved superpower relations and the 
kremlins rhetoric was far milder than its denunciations of the 
1983 us invasion of grenada 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim p perfiliev told a news 
briefing the sending of us troops to panama whatever its 
motivation has provoked a feeling of serious concern in the soviet 
union 
he said the us action violated the un charter and recognized 
rules of international relations and should be condemned by the 
international community the united states he said must 
immediately stop its armed intervention in panama 
millions of soviets saw dramatic footage of the attack on the 
nightly tv newscast vremya 
commentator igor fyesunenko again the world hears the loud 
voice of gunboat diplomacy and understands perfectly well that 
the anger of washington is caused not by the american concern about 
panama but by the wish to disrupt the process of transferrence of 
the ownership rights of the panama canal and to preserve the 
complex of american military bases on the territory of this 
country he said 
tass said none of the arguments put forth by president bush to 
justify the military operation stands up to scrutiny 
this action is an example of notorious gunboat diplomacy 
which has been used for decades by the united states in an attempt 
to turn latin american and caribbean nations into its backyard 
the official news agency said 
bush said the troops were sent to protect us lives and 
apprehend gen manuel antonio noriega who stands accused by 
washington of setting up a succession of puppet regimes while 
running a military empire that purportedly trafficked in colombian 
cocaine 
perfiliev dismissed the allegations of drug trafficking as a 
pretext to intervene in panamanian affairs 
the soviet union is steadfastly against international drug 
trafficking he said reflecting the soviets greater attention 
under leader mikhail s gorbachev to global problems that were once 
dismissed as symptoms of capitalist decay 
we have something else here perfiliev said we are 
commenting on the intervention of the united states in a sovereign 
state no matter what the motivation this is something we are very 
concerned about 
despite soviet concern perfiliev indicated the us action 
would not reverse the direction of improved sovietus relations 
we are now in a situation where an event in the east or in the 
west is not perceived is not evaluated in terms of confrontation 
between east and west the soviet spokesman said 
but he said i think both the soviet union and the united 
states would stand to gain if a situation could be achieved where 
there is not interference in the affairs of others 
tass however said sending us troops to panama did not 
involve just another regional conflict it is a dangerous 
encroachment on the unsteady equilibrium that has been achieved in 
the world arena it said 
the united states it said has challenged the entire 
international community and is acting against universal human 
interests 
official soviet reaction to the us actions in panama was 
markedly more restrained than when former president ronald reagan 
ordered the invasion of grenada in 1983 
at that time the government newspaper izvestia accused the 
united states of carrying out a stinking show it also said 
reagan was obsessed with the ideas of world domination 
perfiliev said all countries would benefit from policies of 
noninterference which the soviet leadership under gorbachev has 
repeatedly professed to be its policy 
all states would stand to gain when all peoples of all 
countries decide their own destinies perfiliev said

us sen dave durenberger said wednesday his 
financial dealings did not violate senate rules but he apologized 
for mistakes he made and said he would work to restore public 
confidence 
in retrospect it is clear that i made mistakes and had lapses 
in judgment on these matters he said at the first of four news 
conferences planned throughout the state wednesday i apologize 
this morning to the people of minnesota 
durenberger a republican said he did not intend to circumvent 
senate rules on outside income when he signed a book deal with a 
minneapolis publisher which resulted in his earning 100000 in 
outside income over two years 
the senate ethics committee is trying to determine whether 
durenberger used the book deal to circumvent limits on senators 
income from speaking fees the limit in 1985 was about 22500 in 
1986 it was about 30000 
durenberger earlier said his appearances were to promote his two 
books neither madmen nor messiahs and prescription for 
change and that he cleared his activity with the federal 
election commission which ruled it was allowable compensation 
the book deal was one of three plans durenberger had for 
boosting his income when he was having financial difficulties two 
of the arrangements are being looked at by the ethics committee 
the book matter and allegations that he scheduled speeches in 1985 
and 1986 to coincide with appointments he and his wife had with a 
marriage counselor in boston 
in addition the senate rules committee is looking into 
durenberger charging the senate for rent at a minneapolis 
condominium in which he had a financial interest committee aides 
have said their tentative conclusion was that the matter belonged 
before the ethics committee 
durenberger charged the senate for rent whenever he stayed at 
the condo and collected at least 9947 in expense payments from 
the senate for time he spent in minnesota from july 1983 to june 
1987 
durenberger said wednesday he relied on advice from legal 
counsel and tax experts but said he should have paid more 
attention to the details 
the senator also said he has no intention of resigning from the 
senate and pledged to work to restore public confidence in him

irans foreign ministry on wednesday 
denied a us report that israel bought oil from tehran in a bid to 
free three military men believed held by proiranian militants in 
lebanon iranian tv reported 
the broadcast monitored in cyprus quoted a foreign ministry 
statement as saying that not even one barrel of oil had been 
sold to israel one of revolutionary irans main regional foes 
according to irrevocable declared principles of the islamic 
republic the oil ministry has imposed a ban on the sale of oil and 
oilrelated products to israel and the racist south african 
regime the statement said 
tehran has vowed never to establish relations with israel and 
south africa 
the statement added that no oil has been sold to those countries 
since irans 1979 islamic revolution which toppled shah mohammed 
reza pahlavi 
the us state department on tuesday confirmed an nbctv report 
monday that israel bought 2 million barrels of oil worth 36 
million from iran in november to help free the three israelis held 
in lebanon 
israeli representatives also have discussed the possibility of 
selling iran spare parts for its usmade military hardware nbc 
said citing unidentified sources in us and israeli intelligence 
in addition to winning irans help in releasing the israelis 
the oil purchases and the potential spare parts deal were intended 
to bolster irans position against iraq their common enemy nbc 
said 
spokesmen for israels energy foreign and defense ministries 
refused to comment on the report 
nbc reported that the us government had backed the oil deal in 
hopes that it could help the release of eight american hostages in 
lebanon 
they are among 18 westerners held in lebanon by extremist 
groups most are captives of iranianbacked shiite factions 
irans leaders are avowedly antiisraeli but the iranian 
economy battered by 10 years of poor management and 8 years of war 
against iraq badly needs foreign exchange for postwar 
reconstruction 
president hashemi rafsanjani was closely involved in clandestine 
armsforhostages dealings with the united states and israel in 
198586 
three american hostages held in lebanon were freed in exchange 
for deliveries of usmade antiaircraft and antitank missile 
parts 
rafsanjani leader of tehrans socalle pragmatists is seeking 
to rebuild irans links with the west to end 10 years of isolation 
and seek badly needed investment 
he generally is considered to be in favor of freeing the 
hostages held in lebanon but has limited room to maneuver because 
of opposition by hardliners led by former interior minister ali 
akbar mohtashemi who has close ties with the lebanese militants

romance cant be used to avoid repaying 
loans to a former lover the iowa supreme court said wednesday 
the loans were not accumulated property of cohabiting 
parties the court said 
the practical effect of denying recovery under the facts of 
this case would be to permit a person to escape payment of a debt 
by simply entering into a romantic relationship with the 
creditor the court said 
in a black hawk county case the supreme court reversed a lower 
court order and ordered terry goro to repay money lent to him by 
his former lover jerri shold it sent the case back to the lower 
court to determine precisely how much money is owed 
court records said the case began in 1977 when ms shold was a 
student at the university of northern iowa and goro one of her 
teachers they began an affair though both were married to others 
at the time 
by 1980 ms shold was divorced and court records said goro was 
anxious to obtain a divorce but pleaded financial difficulties 
jerri agreed to help the court said each month terry 
would let jerri know the amount of his financial needs and she 
would give him a check for that amount 
the relationship continued for years and included moves together 
to minneapolis and california and back to cedar falls the court 
noted 
finally goro was transferred to detroit in 1986 and the 
relationship ended the court said 
at that point ms shold sought repayment of the loans 
jerri acknowledges that there was no specific agreement as to 
when the money would be repaid because they did not know how long 
terry would need the money the court noted 
simply because the two had a longterm relationship doesnt 
erase the responsibility to repay a loan the court said 
jerris claim does not arise out of the relationship of the 
parties but from loans made to terry the court said although 
the loans were intended to foster the relationship and perhaps to 
eventually encourage a more permanent arrangement they retained 
their character as loans 
they were clearly not the accumulated property of cohabiting 
parties

a jury began deliberating the fate of 
larry mahoney on wednesday after a prosecutor said its time to 
pay for the 27 deaths he allegedly caused in an alcoholrelated 
headon collision with a crowded bus 
mahoneys lawyers said he will forever be tormented by last 
years fiery disaster on interstate 71 but argued that the real 
culprit was the builder of the bus in which victims died of a fire 
rather than the crash itself 
special prosecutor paul richwalsky said mahoney must be held to 
account for his decision to drink and drive 
i know that mahoney regrets it but thats got nothing to do 
with this case richwalsky said in closing arguments in carroll 
circuit court 
the apologies are too late now its time to pay 
defense attorneys jack hildebrand and william summers said ford 
motor co manufactured a bus with a vulnerable fuel tank that made 
it a rolling bomb 
mahoney sobbed at times while his attorneys appealed to the jury 
to free him from 82 criminal charges 27 counts of murder 12 of 
firstdegree assault 42 of wanton endangerment and one of drunken 
driving 
mahoney 36 could be sentenced to 20 years to life in prison if 
convicted of murder the jury was given options of seconddegree 
manslaughter five to 10 years or reckless homicide one to five 
years on those counts conviction of firstdegree assault carries 
a penalty of 10 to 20 years and the term is one to five years for 
wanton endangerment 
hildebrand said mahoney admittedly was drunk and driving on the 
wrong side of i71 when his pickup collided with the former school 
bus owned by the radcliff first assembly of god church in hardin 
county 
twentyfour children and three adults died in the explosion and 
fire that followed the collision of the 40 who escaped 12 
suffered severe burns 
the crash occurred on may 14 1988 a saturday when a church 
youth group was returning home from a cincinnati amusement park 
hildebrand repeated the defenses claim that mahoney after a 
day of casual beer drinking was tricked that night into drinking 
vodka then allowed by supposed friends to drive away 
mahoney could not have made a conscious decision to drive north 
in the southbound lanes of i71 exhibiting the extreme 
indifference to human life that a jury must find to support a 
murder or firstdegree assault charge hildebrand said 
nor was it mahoneys fault that the bus its chassis built by 
ford its body by shellerglobe corp was susceptible to fire in 
a collision hildebrand said 
should larry mahoney have known he was going to hit a 
bomb hildebrand said he caused the collision but larry did 
not cause the fire the explosion the deaths the injuries 
hildebrand said 
richwalsky said the defense theory of involuntary intoxication 
and a dangerous bus was an attempt to mask and cover mahoneys 
responsibility 
do you think if you drink all day and pour yourself behind the 
wheel or your vehicle that something bad isnt going to happen 
richwalsky said 
this was a predictable disaster he said drunk drivers 
going the wrong way happen every day this time he hit a bus 
richwalsky pressed the jurors for a conviction on each murder 
count 
these 27 people are just as dead as if they had been shot or 
stabbed theyre just as dead from his conduct he said 
summers in an emotional closing argument said no one can do 
anything to punish him worse than mahoney already punishes 
himself 
larry has the rest of his life every waking minute to 
remember this he said the punishment in his heart will never 
never go away 
but richwalsky said mahoney sought to blame others ford motor 
co and his drinking buddies 
richwalsky then showed the jury the identification picture on 
mahoneys driver license 
in the picture mahoney wore a cap with a fourword slogan 
ride hard die hard and added on that saturday night 
he rode hard those people died hard

pentagon officials said wednesday they were 
not actively considering a major military withdrawal from east 
asia although planners recently drafted a memorandum outlining 
such a possibility 
the asahi shimbun and washington post reported this week that 
pentagon officials were considering closing us bases in the 
philippines and withdrawing forces from south korea and japan 
that policy was outlined in a paper discussed at a meeting 
monday involving defense secretary dick cheney and gen colin 
powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff but many other 
options also were discussed said two pentagon officials 
there is no decision and no deadline for a decision said 
one of the sources both officials spoke on the condition he not be 
further identified 
another source said that no such withdrawal was being considered 
for the next two or three years 
our security in the pacific is based on a robust presence 
based on agreements with as many nations as possible and 
therefore the united states is unlikely to close any east asian 
bases in the near future said another official 
the meeting among the top pentagon brass concerned the future 
of us security interests in the pacific we are looking at a 
number of longterm possibilities said one source 
consideration of reducing the us military presence in the 
pacific was prompted by changes in eastern europe and budgetary 
restraints 
there has been a change in the soviet bloc the threat is 
reduced said the source 
us pacific forces include 222238 personnel 50000 in japan 
45000 in hawaii 32000 in south korea and 34000 at sea 
according to pentagon statistics additionally the united states 
operates two important bases in the philippines

an agriculture department report wednesday 
showed that farmers didnt make as much money the last few years as 
agency economists had been reporting 
the economic research service the professional usda agency that 
keeps the financial books on agriculture issued revised estimates 
reflecting higher expenses than had been used in the earlier 
computations 
one of the effects was to reduce the net cash income of farmers 
the money left over after deducting cash expenses from gross cash 
proceeds during the calendar year it includes government payments 
and proceeds from crops grown in earlier years 
the revisions based on 1987 figures from the federal census of 
agriculture showed that net cash income in 1987 was 545 billion 
instead of the 577 billion reported as recently as a month ago 
in 1988 according to te revisions net cash income of farmers 
rose to 572 billion not the 599 billion stated previously 
this year according to the agencys new report the net cash 
income of farmers may be in the range of 52 billion to 57 
billion that is unchanged from the earlier forecast 
economist greg gajewski who oversees preparation of the monthly 
report said that the 1987 census benchmark now being used showed 
that farm expenses turn out about 3 percent higher than had been 
estimated earlier 
it suggests farmers did a little less well than we thought 
they were doing gajewski said in a telephone interview 
but he noted that despite the downward revisions the new income 
numbers for those years are still records and that the rebound 
from the financial crisis is still very real 
the revised figures also prompted changes in another method of 
farm accounting used by the agency that involves net farm 
income which measures the value of production including federal 
payments in a specific year changes in the value of crop and 
livestock inventories are part of the annual accounting 
under this method net farm income in 1987 was 435 billion 
instead of the 471 billion reported previously in 1988 net farm 
income was revised to 427 billion from 457 billion 
this years estimate was pegged at 48 billion instead of in a 
range of 48 billion to 53 billion used a month ago

the security council delayed its debate on 
panama on wednesday while trying to decide which government is 
legitimate gen manuel antonio noriegas regime or the 
usinstalled administration 
the united states with the help of other western members 
stalled the council while pressing for recognition of a new un 
ambassador to be appointed by the fledgling panamanian government 
of guillermo endara 
endara was widely believed to have won the presidency in 
panamas national elections may 7 but noriega the military 
leader canceled the balloting before results were announced 
the overnight invasion by us military forces ousted noriega 
and installed endara as president 
endara was expected to appoint eduardo vallarino a panamanian 
businessman in selfimposed exile in the united states as its un 
ambassador said diplomats 
panama has no ambassador currently accredited at the united 
nations the previous permanent representative leonardo kam was 
promoted to foreign minister and no one had taken his place 
noriegas government is reportedly trying to have its ambassador 
to the european community merla bellavita accredited as its un 
ambassador 
the security council was originally to hold its emergency 
meeting wednesday morning said officials at the mission of 
colombia which currently chairs the council 
diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity said however that 
wrangles over which panamanian ambassador was representing the 
legitimate government delayed the meeting council members held 
meetings among themselves to decide how to proceed 
the security council is faced with having to decide which 
foreign minister represents panamas legitimate government 
noriegas appointee kam or whomever endara appoints 
in an afternoon news conference in washington secretary of 
state james a baker iii said endara is moving to appoint 
ambassadors to washington and the united nations 
us ambassador thomas r pickering said the united states acted 
in selfdefense when it sent its military forces to panama to oust 
noriega 
alejandro serrano caldera the ambassador of nicaragua which 
called for an emergency security council meeting retorted that 
the united states has no legal or ethical right to intervene in 
other countries affairs 
speaking in spanish through an interpreter serrano caldera said 
we want the council to call for an immediate withdrawal of the 
us troops 
pickering told reporters outside the council that the united 
states had the right to intervene under article 51 of the un 
charter which provides for the use of armed force to defend a 
country to defend our interests and our people its the socalled 
selfdefense article 
panamanian soldiers shot and killed a us marine officer at a 
roadblock on saturday night 
panamas declaration last week that a state of war existed 
with the united states and the attacks on our citizens over the 
weekend are several of the things which the president has cited 
which required us to move in selfdefense pickering said 
white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said president bush 
ordered us troops to seize noriega and bring him to the united 
states for trial on federal drug charges 
baker informed secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar of the 
military moves by telephone at 2 am wednesday said the un 
chiefs spokesman francois giuliani 
perez de cuellar is extremely concerned about the crisis 
said giuliani 
panama has repeatedly come before the security council to 
complain of allegedly provocative us military maneuvers that it 
said were intended to lay the groundwork for an invasion to topple 
the government 
panama claimed during council debates in april and august that 
the united states is trying to provoke confrontations in order to 
keep control of the panama canal 
under a 1977 treaty the united states is to turn over control 
of the canal to panama at the end of 1999

czechoslovakia and the soviet 
union agreed wednesday to begin reviewing the presence of 80000 
soviet troops stationed here since the prague spring reforms 
were crushed in 1968 
foreign minister jiri dienstbier and premier marian calfa told 
reporters after returning from a oneday visit to moscow that a 
joint commission will be set up in the first half of january 
the commission composed of civilian and military experts also 
will reexamine the political and historical events that led up to 
the soviet invasion and its consequences dienstbier said at an 
airport news conference 
dienstbier who has said he hopes an agreement can be reached 
soon on the withdrawal of soviet troops told reporters the 
commission would deal with all aspects of the soviet military 
presence in czechoslovakia 
calfa was asked if there would soon be a timetable for a pullout 
of the troops which have been stationed in czechoslovakia on a 
temporary basis for 21 years 
i dont know but i think we will have results in this area 
that will satisfy the nation calfa replied without elaboration 
in moscow the official news agency tass announced that the 
soviet union had agreed to negotiate its troop presence in 
czechoslovakia tass said dienstbier and his soviet counterpart 
eduard a shevardnadze agreed to begin the talks in the first two 
weeks of next month

withdrawal of its troops but the czechoslovak state news agency 
ctk has said the east bloc country would begin preliminary 
negotiations for the pullout of soviet troops 
dienstbier said he met with shevardnadze for more than an hour 
wednesday calfa met with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov 
calfa said he left moscow with the feeling that there was

the sovietled warsaw pact invasion in august 1968 signed the 
initial document allowing the troops presence after tense 
negotiations in the kremlin where he was flown right after the 
invasion 
since the ouster of hardline communist leaders the last month 
the new czechoslovak leadership has said the agreement was invalid 
because it was signed under duress

policies of the past and for abusing its opponents after the 1968 
crackdown 
earlier this month the soviet union condemned the invasion as a 
mistake under gorbachev the kremlin has vowed not to interfere in 
the affairs of its warsaw pact allies 
poland east germany hungary and bulgaria also have apologized 
for their roles in the invasion 
dienstbier sai before the visit that any troop withdrawals must 
run parallel with eastwest talks on conventional weapons 
reductions under way in vienna where a preliminary accord is 
expected next year 
faced with a peaceful revolution czechoslovakias hardline

opposition to president nicolae ceausescu 
is centered in ethnically diverse transylvania and in the northern 
part of moldavia both of which have stronger historical links to 
the west than the romanian heartland that is ceausescus home 
periodic outbreaks of unrest have shaken romania over the years 
triggered by harsh living conditions in the balkan nation 
in 1977 about 30000 coal miners went on strike in the jiu 
valley to protest ceausescus ironfisted domestic policies 
policies that put an early chill on any form of organized 
opposition 
the valley is romanias leading coal basin in rugged western 
transylvania 
the miners demanded pay raises more food on the shelves and 
improved working conditions 
faced with the first big wave of opposition since he became 
communist party leader in 1965 ceausescu gave in to the strikers 
demands 
police however subsequently arrested and harassed hundreds of 
people who took part in that work action 
protest leaders disappeared under mysterious circumstances in 
traffic accidents 
in november 1987 at least 10000 workers demonstrated in brasov 
in southern transylvania demanding freedom more food and 
ceausescus ouster the uprising was brutally put down by police 
and the army 
in the most dramatic protest faced by the 71yearold marxist 
autocrat hundreds perhaps thousands of demonstrators were 
reported to have died last weekend in unrest in timisoara also 
part of transylvania and 500 miles from the capital bucharest 
security forces randomly shot into crowds of protesters there 
scenic timisoara the city of flowers noted for its many parks 
and trees is the capital of the banat a region of mixed 
population containing romanians hungarians serbs and germans 
it was on timisoaras main liberty square that the protesters 
were killed by ceausescus security forces 
it was also on that square that gheorghe doja leader of a 
peasant uprising in 1514 and a national symbol against oppression 
died under torture 
like the peasants the protesters last weekend demanded freedom 
they shouted down with ceausescu down with the dictator 
and today in timisoara tomorrow in the whole country in 
allusion to the spreading revolt that apparently has gripped the 
country according to witnesses 
in the other corner of romania in iasi close to the soviet 
border people on wednesday were burning books by ceausescu mihai 
munteanu a member of the soviet congress of peoples deputies 
said in moscow 
ceausescus writings had been prominently displayed in bookstore 
windows there 
iasi is an old cultural and historical center french influence 
was dominant there starting in the 18th century many sons from 
welloff families traveled to paris to complete their education 
they gradually formed the nucleus of an intellectual class 
which favored french philosophy and thought and became receptive to 
the liberal ideas of the french revolution and later trends 
hundreds of romanian students marched in iasi in january 1987 
demanding better food and more heat in their cold dormitories 
industrial workers held several strikes there 
munteanu an ethnic romanian who lives in soviet moldavia a 
former romanian region annexed by moscow in 1940 said he spoke 
with acquaintances in romania and was told that prodemocracy 
demonstrations were going on in several cities 
southern romania historically known as walachia lived for five 
centuries under the ottoman turks and has little democratic 
tradition 
the historic development of transylvania was substantially 
different and more complex 
the province benefited from comparatively higher cultural and 
political standards under the austrohungarian empire until the 
empire collapsed in 1918 when transylvania was united with the 
romanian kingdom 
during its long experience under the hapsburgs and hungarians 
transylvania became intimately associated with the events in 
central and western europe 
opportunities for travel to vienna and cultural contacts that 
developed shaped the peoples political awareness 
as ceausescu stubbornly rejected reforms under way in the warsaw 
pact countries the opposition found it could now learn something 
from its marxist neighbors by way of special tv antennas it could 
pick up soviet hungarian and yugoslav programs 
even in bucharest about 35 miles north of the bulgarian border 
the 2 million residents can watch bulgarian television apparently 
unhindered 
you cant keep romanians isolated from the outside world as 
ceausescu would like a woman living in iasi six miles from the 
soviet border said its enough to have a tv or a radio set to 
be kept abreast of developments in the world 
the virus of freedom is spreading anyway she told the 
associated press

the hardline communist state have been chilly since solidarity 
took over the polish government in august

parliament approved a farm bill with only 
one dissenting vote wednesday indicating it will accept the entire 
government plan to transform polands centralized economy into a 
marketoriented system 
the vote of 2841 followed more than two days of sharp debate 
much of it critical of the governments agricultural policies and 
represented overall support for reform beyond party lines 
industry minister tadeusz syryjczyk and the head of the central 
planning office jerzy osiatynski said they felt the entire 
package would be approved a finance official said a letter of 
intent on an international monetary fund agreement would be signed 
with the imf soon 
the soviet blocs first noncommunist government led by 
solidarity is pushing economic reform in an effort to conquer 
annual inflation of 900 percent a burdensome 39 billion foreign 
debt and qualify for desperately needed western economic aid 
officials acknowledge the program which takes controls off 
prices ends most subsidies and limits wage increases and will be 
painful in the beginning it is expected to cause a 20 percent drop 
in real incomes and put 400000 people out of work in a nation 
unaccustomed to unemployment 
before wednesdays vote bronislaw geremek the solidarity 
leader in parliament said in urging support for the farm 
resolution we are convinced that polish farmers will be able 
to understand the interests of the state 
prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki and the architect of economic 
reform deputy premier leszek balcerowicz sat side by side in the 
chamber as the vote was taken 
by wednesday three days after balcerowicz presented the 
economic plan to parliament the government appeared increasingly 
confident of passage 
osiatynski head the planning office said i think it will be 
voted in before the first of january the difficulties will start 
only once it is voted in and once we start carrying it out 
janusz sawicki deputy finance minister said poland would sign 
a letter of intent with the imf within the upcoming few days 
after the letter is signed sawicki said he expects the imf to 
announce preliminary acceptance of polands economic reform program 
he said that would allow poland to get a 215 million bridge 
loan from the bank of international settlements in switzerland and 
release a 1 billion loan pledged by a group of western countries 
led by the united states and west germany to support turning the 
zloty into a convertible currency 
the imf is expected to ratify the agreement at the end of 
january or early february sawicki said in it poland agrees to 
continue a strict regimen of reform in exchange for a 700 million 
line of credit from the imf 
certification by the imf would open the way to money from other 
western lenders including a world bank loan of 300 million and 
rescheduling of polands 40 billion hardcurrency debt

romania declared a state of emergency 
wednesday in the western region around timisoara where security 
forces may have killed thousands of people in crushing 
antigovernment protests 
tens of thousands marched through the city to demand the bodies 
of protesters chanting give us our dead 
reports said protests of president nicolae ceausescus iron rule 
had spread to at least eight more cities since the bloody weekend 
at timisoara which is in transylvania only 30 miles from the 
yugoslav and hungarian borders and about 500 miles from the capital 
bucharest 
ceausescu the last autocrat in the soviet bloc declared the 
emergency hours after returning from a threeday state visit to 
iran romanian state radio reported 
it said an 11 pm curfew in the city of 350000 and surrounding 
region applied to everyone except workers on factory night shifts 
and banned gatherings of five or more people 
soldiers police and members of special militias were placed on 
alert the radio said without specifying what that meant 
in a broadcast speech earlier ceausescu ignored international 
condemnation and said fascists and foreigners were fomenting unrest 
in his stalinist land 
he said soldiers fired warning shots sunday in timisoara when 
threatened by hooligan elements but did not mention casualties 
the military units were compelled to defend themselves 
he said but were very patient and did not respond even when 
soldiers and officers were hit 
few foreigners and no journalists could get into romania 
reporters already there including those from allied nations were 
not allowed to travel freely 
eastern european reporters who tried to reach timisoara from 
bucharest were turned back 30 miles away the soviet yugoslav and 
east german news agencies reported 
timisoara remained inaccessible to foreign travelers and 
telephone callers wednesday it also was impossible to telephone 
bucharest from vienna 
a yugoslav trucker said he saw graffiti daubed on walls in a 
timisoara suburb early wednesday calling for an uprising 
against the ceausescu regime on dec 24 he reported sporadic 
gunfire and from the direction of downtown timisoara 
a pole who reached budapest hungary from timisoara on 
wednesday told the daily mai nap it was like a city under siege 
i saw them tossing dead into the river people told me over 1000 
people were killed 
dispatches from the yugoslav and hungarian news agencies said 
timisoara was full of police and soldiers wednesday but that 
50000 people went into the streets nonetheless western 
businessmen who crossed into yugoslavia said wednesdays protest 
began at a factory in the morning 
the businessmen said the people went to a stadium where they 
apparently believed authorities were keeping the bodies chanting 
give us our dead 
no police intervention was reported by the businessmen or the 
yugoslav news agency tanjug which quoted the yugoslav consul 
general in timisoara mti the hungarian news agency said some 
soldiers joined the demonstrators in chanting slogans against 
ceausescu 
in a dispatch quoting romanians working in east germany the 
official east german agency adn said unrest had spread to at least 
eight other romanian cities and the death toll in timisoara could 
reach 3000 or 4000 
casualty estimates have risen daily since sunday no independent 
confirmation is possible because of romanias isolation 
large numbers of soldiers and police were reported in the 
streets of bucharest and other major cities according to a 
hungarian who telephoned five cities and dispatches from eastern 
european journalists in the romanian capital 
mihnea berindei paris spokesman for a group called defense of 
human rights in romania said some policemen entered hospitals to 
arrest wounded protesters belgrade radio said police burst into 
the yugoslav consulate the only diplomatic building in timisoara 
and seized demonstrators who took refuge there 
yugoslavias foreign ministry would not confirm or deny the 
incident which would be a violation of diplomatic conventions 
in a report from the yugoslav border with romania tanjug said 
there was no more room in timisoara hospitals 
the hungarian red cross appealed for international help in 
searching for victims of the crackdown 
ceausescu who has ruled romania since 1965 delivered a 
25minute broadcast address after his return home with his entire 
government and wife elena the second most powerful person in 
romania lined up behind him 
he sought to blame hungary which he has accused of wanting to 
reclaim transylvania where most of romanias 17 million ethnic 
hungarians live hungary ruled the region for centuries but it was 
given to romania in 1920 by the treaty of trianon 
foreign minister gyula horn said earlier that hungary was not 
involved in the unrest 
in his speech the 71yearold romanian leader blamed the 
trouble on fascists cooperating with reactionary imperialist 
circles and espionage centers 
the aim of these antinational provocative actions was to 
provoke disorder and to create the conditions for the territoral 
dismemberment of romania of its independence and sovereignty he 
declared 
ceausescu has governed with increasing harshness in recent 
years he has ignored international criticism of his human rights 
policies and enforcing industrialization and debt repayment 
programs that caused rationing and other hardships 
because none of his remarks dealt with those problems which 
have created widespread discontent it appears he will continue to 
rely on the army and legions of uniformed and secret police to 
perpetuate his regime 
tanjug reported from bucharest quoting unofficial sources that 
a state of full alert has been introduced across romania as 
protests and unrest continue in timisoara and other towns 
adn said unrest had spread to the other transylvanian cities of 
brasov scene of a large antigovernment protest in 1987 cluj and 
sibiu to the black sea port of constanta and at least four other 
cities

the former head of the us southern command 
in panama said wednesday that the military strike against panama 
was wellplanned and wellexecuted even though he has long 
opposed the use of force there 
retired gen fred woerner who left the southern command on 
sept 30 also said the operation would be judged a disaster an 
absolute catastrophe if gen manuel antonio noriega returns to 
power 
woerner had opposed military intervention in panama advocating 
diplomatic and other peaceful options to dislodge noriega the 
panamanian leader has been indicted on drug charges in the united 
states 
various us administrations failed to deal successfully with 
noriega ultimately pushing president bush into a corner where he 
could do nothing except send in the military woerner said 
bush had no other options it had reached a point where an 
american was killed he said 
woerner in a telephone interview from san jose calif said 
bush called for the military strike to protect the lives of 
americans and ensure freedom of movement in the panama canal 
although he did not have inside knowledge of the military 
operation woerner said it appeared from news reports that it was 
handled professionally and competently 
the military operation looked wellplanned and 
wellexecuted woerner said adding however that it apparently 
took longer than expected 
woerner described noriega as a clever clever guy the us 
operation wont be considered successful unless noriega is either 
captured or driven from panama and never returns woerner said 
he said he did not think bush would call off the operation until 
it was certain that noriega could never return to panama

bombsniffing dogs and squadrons of 
police provided tight security wednesday as a crowd of mourners 
paid their respects to a federal appeals judge killed by the first 
in a series of mail bombs 
st lukes episcopal church was filled to overflowing with more 
than 700 people who were asked to put aside their anger over the 
slaying long enough to remember the contributions of us circuit 
judge robert vance 
dogs searched the church before the service and dozens of 
officers kept watch during the 35minute program of scripture 
hymns and a eulogy 
vance a member of the 11th us circuit court and a former 
chairman of the alabama democratic party was killed instantly last 
saturday when the bomb exploded in his home propelling nails into 
his lower abdomen his wife helen was injured in the bombing and 
remained hospitalized wednesday 
a similar bomb two days later killed a civil rights lawyer in 
savannah ga city alderman robert robinson a package bomb was 
found in the atlanta courthouse including the 11th circuit on 
monday and a fourth mailed bomb was removed tuesday from the naacp 
headquarters in jacksonville fla 
all four targets can be linked to school desegregation efforts 
by the national association for the advancement of colored people 
leading investigators to speculate that a white racist group may be 
responsible 
four anonymous letters mailed in august to declare war on 
various federal appeals courts are being examined for clues to the 
bombings fbi spokesman greg jones said wednesday in washington 
the bombs and threats has prompted the naacp to boost security 
at its offices executive director benjamin hooks said wednesday at 
the organizations national headquarters in baltimore 
hooks said hes convinced the bombs were the work of white 
supremacists who feel threatened by recent victories for blacks in 
courtrooms and at the polls 
i think its the work of white supremacists without any 
question i think it reveals the derangement demented criminally 
stupid minds he said 
leaders of the ku klux klan are denying any involvement 
there aint nobody in any white supremacist group got sense 
enough to make a bomb said daniel b carver georgia grand 
dragon of the invisible empire knights of the ku klux klan im 
hoping if its one of those big drug dealers maybe theyll take 
credit for it and get the fbi off our backs 
carver was one of several defendants who had appealed a 950000 
jury verdict against two klan groups for pelting civil rights 
marchers with rocks and bottles in forsyth county the 11th circuit 
refused in october to rehear the defendants appeal 
at vances service us bankruptcy judge clifford fulford of 
birmingham a close friend of vance delivered the eulogy asking 
the mourners to put aside our outrage for awhile to honor vance 
the assassins were cheated if they thought that bob vance was 
afraid to die fulford said he described the 58yearold vance 
as a strong believer in the law and a man who stood up for the 
underdog and the oppressed 
no wonder his assassins could not stand such a man in their 
presence 
friends of the vance family said his remains have been cremated 
and his ashes will be placed in the church 
because of the rash of bombs and the attendance of public 
officials the church south of birmingham was surrounded by 
police barriers and cordoned off with yellow tape 
among those who attended the service were sessions attorney 
general dick thornburgh supreme court justice anthony kennedy the 
justice who oversees the operations of the 11th circuit which 
handles appeals from floria georgia and alabama

opportunity what i would like to do is show you what our forces in 
panama have done during the day the chairman briefed you this 
morning on the point at which we had arrived then operations have 
continued they have gone fairly well for us 
well start out here in rio hato where the two infantry 
companies were you might recall that the infantry companies were 
instrumental in putting down the coup on the third of october 
therefore they were considered to be very loyal the rangers went 
in took them out thats been completed they took their arms 
room they got 250 prisoners roughly the rest fled 
and thats a problem were having in a lot of areas in that 
much of the pdf panamanian defense forces is fleeing in the face 
of the us military units that presents us with a dilemma are 
they in point of fact going to go into the jungle or the woods 
and represent a force in the field or are they going to resolve on 
a life of crime and use their weapons to just raid the people are 
they going to lay their weapons down and go back and try and get a 
job and participate in the hoped for economic prosperity we dont 
know that thats one of the things weve got to be watching and 
one of the things we have to do 
over here in the task force semper fi area everything is pretty 
quiet all of the pdf resistance within that area has been reduced 
as you may recall there was never very much in the first place 
although i cant guarantee you again because this is a big open 
area with a lot of vegetation that there arent some people out 
there 
let me just sneak out here a little bit moves toward map 
up in the task force atlantic area everything up there has been 
reduced first the 8th company elected not to fight very much in 
the first place and the naval infantry company which did fight 
has been reduced therefore the situation is calm up there we 
used one battalion to do that and as you may recall another 
battalion came down into this area punta gamboa where theres a 
housing area and a prison and protected the housing area and 
unprotected the prison went to cerro tigre where theres an 
electrical distribution grid and secured it and went to madden 
dam possibly the most chief facility along the canal because as 
you know thats the water thats used to fill the locks that make 
the canal functional if we lost that and the dam had to be 
rebuilt ive seen estimates where it could take a year or longer 
to fill back up

q general can you try and talk into the microphones 
gen kelly yeah sure im sorry why dont you move that map 
back a little the map is my security symbol and my lesson plan 
of interest is that the canal is functional there has been no 
endeavor that weve uncovered to try to destroy it we have forces 
out along it and we intend to protect it it was actually worked 
somewhat today some ships were moved out and we are hoping as 
early as tomorrow well be moving other ships through the canal so 
thats a real plus for the effort to date 
i would say things up in the task force atlantic area are in 
pretty good shape 
well skip task force bayonet now and go out to what were 
calling task force pacific and thats the one thats built around 
the 82nd airborne brigade which jumped in last night they have 
gotten organized moved out they have attacked the cav squadron at 
panama viejo or engaged the cavalry squadron and reduced it 
there is no longer any resistance there they have engaged the 
infantry company at finajitas and reduced it there is no 
resistance there they have engaged the battalion 2000 another 
anticoup unit from the 3rd of october and found nothing when they 
got there 
actually an ramps team out along the bridge on the pacora river 
last night called in airplanes ac130s and they knocked out nine 
of their vehicles which i think is a pretty good portion of their 
vehicles and the rest fled 
and weve been seeing the pdf fleeing from our troops in most of 
the engagements with some exceptions the naval infantry up here 
at least initially the two companies at rio hato although 
eventually they fled so it looks like the organized resistance in 
these areas is pretty much a thing of the past 
the organized resistance in the task force bayonet area is also 
a thing of the past we were going into the comandancia this 
afternoon with a ranger company to go through it room by room and 
we found it empty we have completed sweeping all of the buildings 
at fort amador and fort amador is now secure although there is 
some shooting down in this area we have established a refugee 
collecting point at balboa and as of midafternoon had about 
1000 people in there and refugees are becoming a problem 
but i think its fair to say that the and our plan was to go 
after the organized combat forces of thepdf first in this area from 
rio hato on out to fort cimarron rio hato in the west fort 
cimarron in the east thats where the preponderance of them are 
thats where the preponderance of the power of the pdf is we 
went after them first we have reduced them and there is no 
organized resistance left in those areas although there are people 
left in those areas there are also a number of dignity battalions 
in those areas primarily in panama city and that has got to be 
our next priority to get in there and to begin to clean that out 
panama city as you know is a city of almost a million people 
urban operations are possibly the most difficult kind they might 
compete with the relief in place in the dark but theyre right up 
there in the degree of difficulty in terms of military operations 
its a large city to sweep through its going to take a lot of 
people thats why we are anxious to get the 7th infantry division 
brigade in tonight and anxious to get the 16th mp brigade 
headquarters and those two companies in 
two companies doesnt sound like much but that goes they go 
with the other mp companies already in panama i believe theres 
five of them so itll represent about a brigade of mps

people who march to a different 
philosophical drummer in mississippi can find liberal camaraderie 
to the beat of such old instruments as sacbuts lutes krummhorns 
cornettos and viola da gambas 
the mississippi academy of ancient music inc brings in groups 
reviving the old inmstruments and period music providing social 
gatherings for many who may not feel comfortable at traditional 
southern blacktie affairs academy president rich mcginnis says 
the academy formed in 1981 evolving from elaborate thanksgiving 
weekend birthday parties for the late civil rights activist ernst 
borinski 
it was kind of the one place where liberal jackson could 
meet said mcginnis a tougaloo college chemistry professor of 
the borinski parties 
borinski who died in 1983 was a polishgerman jew who fled 
from nazi germany to the united states in 1938 and had taught 
sociology at jacksons historically black tougaloo college since 
1947 
he is credited with initiating many academic forums across the 
state during the 1950s and 1960s where both blacks and whites met 
to discuss civil rights issues the former german judge also served 
as undergraduate mentor for a large number of black lawyers 
including reuben anderson mississippis only black supreme court 
justice since reconstruction and the first black to graduate from 
the university of mississippi law school 
borinski would always have a birthday party just after 
thanksgiving it was in a very european style mcginnis recalls 
he would have a little party for his friends from the college and 
so forth other friends from jackson in fact actually it was a 
lot of civil rights people 
one time he was at an aclu auction and he bought an evening of 
music from jean paul the st andrews episcopal choir master 
jean paul wanted to play shadow of your smile or something like 
that all night on the piano but heres a college professor so he 
figures hed better do something serious so he brought some music 
over that they were doing at st andrews 
borinski liked the very old music which jean paul played and a 
month before his next birthday he told mcginnis hed like to have 
a similar performance again mcginnis called on max garriott a 
tour guide and professional musician in vicksburg who is now vice 
president of the mississippi academy of ancient music 
i knew max had composed some baroquestyle music for parties 
so he wound up composing special birthday music for borinski some 
of it adapted from baroque music and some of it original 
mcginnis said 
the parties grew with 250 to 300 people at borinskis 80th 
birthday in 1981 he said 
the birthday parties were one of the crazy things that led 
into all this he said 
and it kind of kept that little group of people together who 
now support the ancient music academy 
mcginnis and garriott said their group is now funded by various 
grants from the national endowment for the arts the mississippi 
arts commission and other public and private sources it is host to 
performances by about four professional groups each year with 
audiences averaging about 200 
most of the performers come from europe because it is in the 
forefront of the growing revival of historically authentic 
performances on period instruments mcginnis said jackson is often 
the groups only southern stop on their american tours 
we present music from 1200 to 1800 600 years worth of music 
and if you go to one concert and dont like it or if you do like 
it it doesnt mean youll react the same way to the next one 
which may be completely different music mcginnis says

the communist party apologized 
wednesday for its hardline policies of the past and for its abuse 
of opponents after the 1968 crackdown on reform its leader said 
the once omnipotent party is nearly bankrupt 
at a key party congress the party also elected to leadership 
roles two men distinguished by their acceptance of the opposition 
including ladislav adamec who initiated official negotiations with 
opposition leader vaclav havel 
adamec the former premier was chosen party chairman vasil 
mohorita former chairman of the communist youth group and another 
main figure in talks with the opposition was elected first 
secretary 
the apology was the first of its kind to the czechoslovak 
people who in the last month have come together in a peaceful 
revolution that ended the communists monopoly on power 
the communist party of czechoslovakia apologizes to the 
czechoslovak people for its past policies said evzen prusa a 
top party official who spoke on national television on the first 
day of a the congress 
it also apologizes for the events following 1968 and for 
expelling and harassing the innocent prusa said 
all the leaders installed after the crushing of the 1968 
prague spring reforms have been ousted from power the past 
month and the party recently condemned the sovietled invasion 
that ended the prague spring 
the party now is maneuvering to try to make the best showing 
possible in free elections expected by july 
in his opening address to the congress party chief karel 
urbanek lashed out at former and present party leaders for 
serious political mistakes that he said caused the partys fall 
from power 
urbanek said that as a member of the ruling politburo he also 
was to blame for allowing hated hardliners to remain in the top 
ranks 
urbanek said the party leadership manifested negligence and 
irresponsibility worthy of punishment for not ousting officials 
such as former prague party boss miroslav stepan and others sooner 
stepan and former party boss milos jakes were accused of being 
politically responsible for a brutal police crackdown on peaceful 
student demonstrations nov 17 that ignited the popular revolution 
leaving stepan on the politburo was an extraordinary 
politically serious mistake urbanek said 
stepan and jakes have since been forced from power 
they denied accusations by a parliamentary commission that they 
were responsible for the november brutality 
urbanek said the party faces bankruptcy disclosing that party 
dues were used to build recreation facilties for top brass about 
which the rankandfile only learned today 
detailing the crisis facing the party urbanek noted that it had 
lost 66290 of its 17 million members in the last month 
about 1000 new members have joined including 143 people purged 
from the party after the 1968 invasion who were recently 
rehabilitated he said 
the speech confirmed the total disarray in which the party finds 
itself following the triumphs of the prodemocracy movement 
im aware things wont be easy in the future adamec told 
the delegates in his acceptance speech adding that he took the job 
out of a feeling of responsibility to correct past mistakes 
adamec resigned as premier this month after failing to form a 
government acceptable to the opposition 
as party chairman he is responsible for external party policy 
including dealing with other political forces mohorita the first 
secretary handles internal policy and administration 
lubos belka representing the reform communist democratic forum 
at the congress asked party leaders to renounce their privileges 
so communists can regain the lost trust of the nation 
communists must no longer work in velvet chairs but must 
return to where they came from he said 
it was not known how many delegates at the congress support the 
reform movement 
but a spokesman for democratic forum indicated during a news 
conference that the congress seemed about evenly split between 
hardliners and reformers 
about 40 delegates from the reformist group were invited to 
attend the congress as nonvoting guests 
democratic forum spokesman rudolf prevratil told the official 
ctk news agency his group was not allowed to participate in 
discussions and charged they had been invited to give the 
impression of democracy within the party 
also among the nonvoting guests were former party members 
expelled in the wake of the 1968 invasion

chancellor helmut kohl of west 
germany recommended wednesday that east germany become stronger 
economically before considering reunion with its rich and powerful 
neighbor 
at the end of an emotional visit to the east he also discounted 
fears of a fourth reich an increasingly used term that raises 
the specter of adolf hitler 
president francois mitterrand of france who arrived in east 
berlin for a threeday official visit hours after kohl returned to 
the west cautioned against changing borders in europe 
for the whole of europe it would not be good indeed it 
would be very dangerous to reopen the issue of the existing 
borders he said 
before returning to bonn kohl said the economic potential of 
the german democratic republic must be strengthened before 
reunification became a possibility he said he expected a treaty 
expanding relations to be completed before east germanys first 
free elections scheduled for may 6 
mitterrand in an interview with east german tv before leaving 
paris said relations between the two german states have very 
special characteristics 
he was the first head of state or government of the three 
western world war ii allies to visit east berlin aides said his 
trip should not be viewed as recognition of east berlin as the east 
german capital which the western allies reject 
the united states soviet union france and britain still have 
authority over berlin as a result of postwar occupation of hitlers 
third reich 
kohl who spent two days in east germany said at a final news 
conference his government would address the concerns of other 
european countries as the two germanys move closer together 
its the most natural thing that germans want to live 
together but we all know it cannot come immediately he said 
east germanys parliament scheduled a session for jan 1112 to 
debate a new travel law and legislation to promote joint ventures 
with western companies 
a draft law providing alternatives to military service for 
conscientious objectors also will be on the agenda the official 
news agency adn reported 
bild a west german newspaper said another passage through the 
berlin wall would be opened friday at the historic brandenburg 
gate a symbol of german unity 
kohl and premier hans modrow agreed at their summit tuesday that 
east germany woulds open a pedestrian crossing at the gate before 
christmas and would lift travel restrictions for west germans on 
christmas eve 
they also signed several agreements and pledged to negotiate a 
treaty bringing them closer together especially by expanding 
economic links 
in a commentary wednesday adn said the summit was a success 
but anyone who hoped kohl would arrive with a sack full of 
rhine gold rejoiced too early 
kohl told reporters intergerman issues that could be discussed 
soon included improving traffic connections and solving joint 
telecommunications and pollution problems 
we will have to work intensively on a common german 
currency he said and acknowledged that as one of the most 
difficult questions 
kohl said the aim of a common currency was to allow west germans 
to buy goods in east germany east germany restricts such purchases 
because state subsidies make many goods much cheaper than in west 
germany and shortages are feared 
in a sign of the rapidly increasing economic links east germany 
announced wednesday the first joint venture with a west german firm 
had been signed a compact disc manufacturing plant is to be built 
by the pilz company based outside munich and the east german 
state conglomerate robotron 
in bonn a working group of both nations on promoting tourism 
held its first meeting 
kohl said west germany will support reform in east germany and 
not only talk but act he pledged however to avoid 
destabilization an apparent reference to the power vacuum 
created by the collapse of communist party control over the past 
two months 
addressing the concerns of neighboring countries kohl said 
fears based in the past are understandable but there is nothing 
to be feared from the future its absurd to talk about a fourth 
reich

a twoday conference of foreign ministers of the 
european community and the arab league gets underway thursday 
despite misgivings discreetly expressed by the united states 
the initiative for the unprecedented meeting came from french 
president francois mitterrand current chairman of the 12nation 
european community to give a new impetus to the ecs exchanges 
with the arab world 
but the united states has taken a critical view of the idea 
conference sources reported because it would exaggerate the 
importance of the ec which is preparing to create a single 
european market among the 12 by 1992 
furthermore the americans dislike the idea of libya syria and 
the palestine liberation organization with which the united 
states has no trade relations participating fully and dealing on 
equal basis with the members of the european community said the 
sources who asked to remain anonymous 
they said britain and some arab countries close to the united 
states notably saudi arabia dragged their feet on taking part in 
the meeting because of the american misgivings 
but all 12 members of the community and the 22 members of the 
arab league finally decided to participate for fear of being 
isolated within their groups 
in washington the state department had no immediate comment on 
the conference said spokesman adam shubb 
libya was seen as the most reluctant arab participant because of 
frances military intervention on behalf of the government of chad 
against libyanbacked rebels as well as the french decision to 
renew the ban on shipment of frenchmade arms to libya 
the government of col moammar gadhafi decided to participate 
only at the urgent request of its arab brothers libyas 
official jana news agency said 
the first steps to creating an arabeuropean dialogue were 
taken in 1973 when the oil crisis had brought the arab states to 
the high point of their power the earlier attempt collapsed 
largely because of political problems including accusations of 
terrorism against libya and syria 
for the current conference the french government has reoriented 
the agenda more toward economic matters 
france is concentrating on a selected list of specific to avoid 
getting bogged down in political subjects such as the plos 
decision to challenge the export of citrus fruit from the 
israelioccupied territories to europe 
the agenda includes such items as agreements on trade in 
petrochemicals the exchange of consulting engineers an 
arabeuropean financial convention european aid to the north 
african railroad network and preparatory work for the proposed 
fixed link by tunnel or bridge across the strait of gibraltar

and then the commandandcontrol capability that the brigade 
headquarters gives us should give us an ability to thicken the 
forces in the vicinity of panama city and to get in there tomorrow 
and do some good work 
i would point out to you that most of the paratroopers and most 
of the soldiers and the rangers who went into panama have at this 
point been awake for three days and theyre pretty tired you 
know they marshal the troops a good 18 hours before they get on 
the airplane 
they fly down which is not a lot of fun because we tend to 
fully book the aircraft and then the most comfortable thing they 
do is to step out the back door and when they get on the ground 
of course theyre using up their adrenalin and theyre nervous 
and so theyre just flat tired we will be doing some work tonight 
and we will be doing some work every night every night but i think 
that the progress has been reasonable understanding that the 
operation has not been going on yet for a full day 
the command and control in my own opinion has been excellent 
the chain of command is short and effective from the secretary of 
defense through the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff to the 
commanderinchief in panama to the field commander who is also 
the commander of the 18th airborne corps and everybody in the 
country who carries a gun works for him 
id be happy to address some of your questions now 
q general how the rio hato situation how many troops in 
thats the montes de los machos 
gen kelly the men of the mountain are the 7th infantry company 
q yes how many of them escaped i mean what kind of forces 
gen kelly hard to say because we think only about a half of 
them were there in the first place they had some of these folks 
and teds the expert on that but they were at the comandancia 
they had a real mixed bag of people at the comandancia protecting 
it it seemed that noriega in his latter days as dictator liked 
to keep moving people around to keep them loose ted do you want 
to add to that 
adm sheafer half the 7th company was up at the comandancia 
q at the comandancia down at rio hato 
adm sheafer at the comandancia youve got 250 at rio hato 
is that right 
gen kelly 250 detainees yes and if that was half the 7th 
company excuse me most of the 6th company we got a pretty good 
slug of them i would think and i wouldnt think more than about 
75 
adm sheafer we havent had a chance to go through all of the 
detainees yet and get an order 
q good intelligence but you think you got a number of them at 
the comandancia 
adm sheafer yes 
q general what can you tell us about the hostage situations 
what can you tell us about the different hotels that house 
americans that apparently the troops have had trouble getting to 
what is the situation and why have the troops had trouble getting 
to these hotels 
gen kelly we now have a clear understanding of the importance 
of getting to the hotels we dont plan to tell you how were going 
to do that because we dont want to help those who are possibly 
around the hotels 
incidentally in some cases people are isolated in hotels but 
theyre not hostages because theyre not being held by anybody 
our original strategy was to attack the pdf and to break its 
structure down i think weve pretty much done that now well 
move in with much greater force into the builtup areas of panama 
city in order to be able to protect the americans and other people 
who are there 
incidentally we dont have an effective police force in panama 
city either a panamanian police force one of the things we 
would hope to get reestablished fairly quicky 
just let me add one thing we know of no americans whove been 
killed as the result of any of this 
q general 
q general can you tell us is there an ongoing hostage 
situation there are you aware of hostages how many do there 
appear to be how much of a problem is it for you 
gen kelly we have reports of hostages some of those reports 
seem credible none of those reports have been verified by our 
military and i think ill ask ted to add anything to that that you 
would choose

<TEXT>
q did you go to the 
q so you said that was where heavy fighting was so you think 
you got got rid of a lot of them there 
adm sheafer weve been trying to track each of the hostage 
reports and we have probably almost a dozen and we have great 
difficulty with the information we have in corroborating any of 
them they vary in numbers ranging from the lows of two or threes 
to the highs in the teens 
q but admiral there was a cbs news producer taken captive at 
one hotel with an abc producer and that abc producer has been 
released how can you say thats not a credible report 
adm sheafer if thats true im unaware of it 
q general do you have any information about 
q what role is the military playing playing in the search for 
general noriega 
gen kelly pardon 
q what role is the military playing in the search for general 
noriega and how is that going 
gen kelly every role we can we have every spigot turned on 
that we can turn on to find the fugitive mr noriega and we 
expect we eventually will 
i lets start with this gentleman 
q just following that up general if i might you said at the 
outset or at least we were told this morning one of the aims was 
to capture general noriega can you walk us through why that 
apparently failed at least in its initial stages were you in the 
right place was he in the wrong place 
gen kelly ahhh he was obviously in the right place hes a 
crafty devil as you know he grew up in a very tough academy so 
hes been used to this for many years he allegedly changes his 
place of residence about four times a night we had him spotted 
several times during the day we thought we had a pretty good idea 
where he was last night we went there and he wasnt there 
q where was that 
gen kelly i would id prefer not to say because he may go 
back there and we may want to go back there again but were 
looking for him very hard of course thats all contingent on 
intelligence and what i meant to say when we had all the spigots 
turned on is we are turning on all our looking listening and 
hearing devices to see if we cant pick him up 
q when you say excuse me for interrupting you general when 
you say that you spotted him several times today are you 
suggesting to us 
gen kelly not today i said yesterday 
q yesterday youre suggesting to us though that youre not 
far away from him that you expect to capture him can you make 
that kind of commitment 
gen kelly no i cant you would probably have to ask my boss 
for that kind of commitment but id just tell you were going to 
try as hard as we know how to try to help mr noriega get a plane 
ride up here 
q general 
q sir have you spotted him at all today since this attack 
began 
gen kelly have we spotted him today no we have not he has 
gone underground 
q general one of the other missions stated goals for this 
mission was to provide greater safety for americans in panama 
especially in view of what you just said you all dont where some 
of these pdf forces have gone off into the jungles or they may 
reemerge in urban areas how exactly has this operation improved 
safety for americans and what kind of safety are you going to 
provide on the streets of panama 
gen kelly first i had also said we know of no american yet 
who has been injured as a result of this operation with the 
exception of one american dependent which i think you know about 
who was killed yesterday 
second we said we have a concern that they have gone off into 
the jungle we dont know for a fact that thats what theyve done 
if they have gone off into the jungle i think theres every chance 
that well go off after them 
i think that by tomorrow youll begin to see a greater presence 
on the streets of panama city one of the main reasons that we went 
down with the size force were going down with and its very 
substantial is to protect life and property and our goals when 
we went to panama was to keep the canal open to protect american 
lives to protect american property and to prepare to help the 
panamanians reachieve democracy 
q do you think americans there now are safe today 
gen kelly in the main yes i do none of them have been hurt

a military court sentenced three palestinians 
to life prison terms wednesday for a firebomb attack on an israeli 
bus that killed a rabbis daughter her three children and an 
israeli soldier the army said 
after sentencing israeli soldiers tried to assault the 
prisoners and turned on journalists as they left the court israel 
radio reported no injuries were reported 
last week the court in ramallah found ahmad takruri 22 jumaa 
adam 20 and mahmud abu harbish 19 guilty of causing the deaths 
by throwing firebombs at the bus as it passed through the biblical 
town of jericho in the occupied west bank 
it found the attack to be premeditated and also convicted the 
men of preparing firebombs in three prior instances adam was given 
two years beyond life because of a twoyear suspended sentence for 
an earlier conviction 
the attack occurred on oct 30 1988 two days before national 
elections it was thought to have given a lastminute boost to 
rightist parties such as prime minister yitzhak shamirs likud 
bloc which urged tougher action against the palestinian uprising 
there had been expectations the three would be sentenced to 
death after military judge lt col yosef shapira said last week 
the court was not bound by the prosecutions request for life 
sentences 
the army prosecutor capt moshe bachar said at the time a 
request for the death sentence was rejected in consultations with 
highranking authorities 
the only person ever executed in israel was nazi war criminal 
adolf eichmann who was hanged in 1962 
chief of staff dan shomron said at the time of the attack that 
it was spontaneous and illplanned 
it was a group of guys who were sitting around at night 
playing cards and decided to throw a firebomb at a passing bus 
he said 
the three were said to have hidden in a banana grove and hurled 
firebombs through the open windows of the passenger bus traveling 
from tiberias to jerusalem 
rachel weiss a 27yearold school teacher and her sons 
netanel 3 rafael 2 and 9monthold efraim were burned to death 
david delarosa a soldier who tried to rescue the family suffered 
severe burns and died later 
on oct 30 a jerusalem court handed down the stiffest sentence 
of the 2yearold uprising against israeli rule giving a 
palestinian 16 life terms for forcing a passenger bus off a cliff 
and killing 16 people 
at least 631 palestinians have been killed by israelis during 
the revolt and 43 israelis have been slain another 161 
palestinians have been killed by their fellow arabs as suspected 
collaborators with israel

iran protested to britain on wednesday 
about british plans to deport two iranian students suspected of 
planning to kill indianborn salman rushdie author of the novel 
the satanic verses 
tehran television said irans foreign ministry sent an official 
protest to london through the swedish embassy which looks after 
iranian interests in britain 
tehran also condemned the arrest of two other iranians who were 
freed late tuesday 
iran cut ties with britain last february after britain protested 
a death sentence imposed on rushdie a british citizen by irans 
revolutionary leader the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
khomeini said the satanic verses blasphemed islam provoking a 
worldwide furor over the book 
the four iranians were arrested friday under the prevention of 
terrorism act which gives police the right to hold them for seven 
days without charge 
the home office said tuesday that engineering students karen 
abrinia 32 and mehrdad kokabi 33 were being deported for 
reasons of national security it did not elaborate 
irans official islamic republic news agency quoted the 
students lawyer zahir aziz as saying they believed they were 
arrested because they were suspected of planning to assassinate 
rushdie who remains in hiding 
the two freed iranians were identified as hussein gharibi and 
javad mousavi 40 a disabled father of four children 
both irna and tehran tv were monitored in nicosia

a regional humane society is 
investigating charges that a county dog pound has been burying 
alive unwanted dogs and cats officials said wednesday 
a number of people reported seeing animals squirming in the back 
of a pickup that was taking animals to a landfill for burial 
however franklin county officials are denying that the animals 
which were supposed to have been killed by carbon monoxide 
poisoning were alive when buried 
debbie allen who works at the landfill office said she was 
working tuesday when a truck filled with animals in plastic bags 
from the franklin county dog pound pulled up 
i saw movement in the back of the truck ms allen said 
at first i thought it was the wind but then i noticed it made a 
teepee effect like a paw reaching up 
the driver who was outside the truck to obtain papers from ms 
allens office swatted the bag with the back of his hand ms 
allen said then he pulled up two other trash bags as if he was 
trying to cover it up 
franklin county board member cliff cockrum said the animals were 
checked before they left the pound in benton the board oversees 
the pound 
when we destroyed animals yesterday tuesday morning we had a 
veterinarian to check each and every animal and he assured us that 
each one was dead before they left the pound cockrum said 
billy hammond sr of benton said he and his two sons examined 
four dogs they found at the landfill 
one of them my boy picked up and it gave out a pitiful whine 
and then it went limp in his arms he said wednesday the other 
three animals were warm and limp and appeared to have been dead 
only minutes hammond said 
cockrum called the reports by ms allen and hammond hearsay 
about 45 animals are destroyed every two weeks at the pound 
they are put in steel boxes linked to the exhaust pipe of a vehicle 
and are asphyxiated with carbon monoxide cockrum said 
the carcasses are dumped at the landfill within two hours of 
death including the 45minute ride from benton to carbondale 
cockrum said 28 animals were killed tuesday including eight or 
nine cats 
hammond said he found another dog barely alive in october and 
asked the state department of agriculture to perform an autopsy on 
the dog dr dk mann confirmed that he performed the procedure at 
the departments animal disease laboratory in centralia 
the autopsy found that the dog had been alive about three hours 
after it was buried hammond said it also found that the animals 
organs were severely burned from inhaling carbon monoxide hammond 
said 
frantz dantzler regional director for the humane society of the 
united states said asphyxiation with carbon monoxide is an 
extremely painful method of euthanasia the most humane and 
least painful method is lethal injection of barbiturates he said 
dantzler said his offers to the county for help in finding a 
more humane euthansia system were ignored 
the society plans to investigate the matter further dantzler 
said in a telephone interview from his home in south bend ind

in another time another president said he 
would not see the united states made into a pitiful helpless 
giant the phrase echoed as president bush ordered american 
troops to crush and capture gen manuel antonio noriega whose 
panamanian regime had withstood an arsenal of american sanctions 
short of force 
part of the mission was reported accomplished within eight hours 
on wednesday with the pentagon declaring that noriega had been 
removed as the strongarm leader of panama 
but he escaped and supporters claimed he was still directing his 
loyalist forces the united states called him a fugitive and said 
he would be tracked and taken to stand trial on us drug 
trafficking indictments 
for more than two years noriega had taunted and incited the 
giant while his foes at home and in washington tried futilely to 
dislodge his grip on power bush whose watchword is prudence said 
it was an enormous frustration but he took it for nearly a year 
for lack of an acceptable alternative 
then he took a risk and went to war fellow citizens last 
night i ordered us military forces to panama he told the 
nation wednesday i took this action only after reaching the 
conclusion that every other avenue was closed and the lives of 
american citizens were in grave danger 
bush gained prompt and predictable support at home from 
democrats as well as republicans he had briefed congressional 
leaders just before us forces went into combat against noriegas 
loyalists in the panama defense forces 
presidents seldom face much political dissent when american 
forces are in combat especially with the kind of provocations 
noriega provided his puppet assembly had declared a state of war 
with the united states and an offduty american officer was shot 
and killed by his forces on saturday 
bush recounted the killing the wounding of another american 
serviceman the capture and beating of a third and threats against 
that mans wife 
that was enough the president said 
gen noriegas reckless threats and attacks upon americans in 
panama created an imminent danger to the 35000 american citizens 
in panama bush said and that is why i directed our armed 
forces to protect the lives of american citizens in panama and to 
bring gen noriega to justice in the united states 
bush had repeatedly encouraged noriegas opponents to kick him 
out of power he had said that noriega was the problem that the 
united states quarrel was with the general alone and that his 
ouster would bring normal diplomatic and economic relations 
yet when dissident officers attempted a coup on oct 3 and 
briefly held noriega american forces stood by inactive us 
forces had blocked two roads and had conferred with coup leaders 
but the administration decided against intervention 
that drew protests from left and right although some 
republicans complained that dovish democrats who opposed 
intervention in other crises were endorsing it retroactively in 
panama 
secretary of state james a baker iii said us commanders had 
been told they could offer support for the coup if there were an 
opportunity to do this without risking bloodshed and significant 
loss of american life and to do so without open military 
involvement 
those instructions ring with irony now that us forces have 
been sent into open combat 
on wednesday baker recalled his october testimony and the 
administration explanation of us inaction at the time of the coup 
attempt 
i said if this administration chose to use force it would 
make its own decisions he told a news conference it would not 
act based on some unknown coup plotters strategy or rationale 
the toll of american soldiers killed in action early wednesday 
mounted into the teens and scores were wounded 
that is the price of using military power it was richard m 
nixon who spoke of the price of shrinking from its use 19 years 
ago if when the chips are down the worlds most powerful 
nation the united states of america acts like a pitiful helpless 
giant the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free 
nations and free institutions throughout the world he said 
announcing he had sent forces to attack communist north vietnamese 
sanctuaries in cambodia 
bush was sure to hear toldyouso comments from those who argued 
the administration should have sent forces to join the october coup 
and noriegas purge of dissident officers after that coup could 
make it more difficult for the united states to quickly complete 
operations and withdraw the additional troops which bush said he 
wants to do as quickly as possible 
the newly installed government of panama led by guillermo 
endara thought to have won the may election noriega annulled 
will need reliable new leaders to take control of the military in 
place of his henchmen 
stability under an elected government will be the real test of 
success whatever happens to noriega the administration has been 
wagering all along that his support was thin and brittle american 
intervention puts that to the test if the theory is correct and he 
is powerless noriega is irrelevant 
but if noriega or his lieutenants are capable of holding out and 
running continuing operations against us forces and the endara 
government the administration will have a major problem on its 
hands 
when president ronald reagan ordered american forces into action 
in the 1983 invasion of grenada and the 1986 air raid on libya the 
operations were swift and brief the bush administration wants 
intervention in panama to be a mission accomplished and quickly 
ended prolonged involvement would stir political opposition at 
home and intensify the inevitable latin american resentment against 
yankee intervention no matter the cause 
bush sought to ease that backlash by saying he wants to get out 
swiftly by lifting economic sanctions against panama under the new 
endara government and by promising anew that the united states 
will turn the canal over to panama at the end of the century

us officials made plans wednesday for the 
possible extradition of embattled gen manuel antonio noriega in 
the event he is captured but his attorneys said he would rather 
die than surrender 
noriega would be flown to a military base in south florida and 
transferred to a secure location to await trial in miami on federal 
drug charges said a us marshals service official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
but his attorneys said noriega who was in hiding wednesday as 
more than 20000 us troops stormed through panama may never be 
captured 
hes a fighter said miami attorney raymond takiff who said 
he talked with his client monday evening and remained in contact 
with the generals aides wednesday i feel unhappily secure in my 
belief that he will be killed he will not be captured should that 
occur the truth will never come out 
the justice department and the marshals service refused to 
release details about noriegas possible extradition or where he 
would be detained citing security concerns 
if general noriega is apprehended and brought here for trial 
he would be given the same treatment as any other person accused of 
a crime no more no less all his rights will be protected 
said us district judge william m hoeveler the trial judge in 
the miami indictment 
noriega and 16 associates face federal drugtrafficking 
indictments returned by grand juries in miami and tampa in 1988 he 
would be tried first on the miami charges justice department 
spokesman david runkel said 
another noriega attorney frank rubino echoed the sentiment 
that the general would never allow us forces to take him alive 
the general is alive well and somewhere in panama and he is 
on top of the situation as far as leading his forces said 
rubino who predicted the presence of us troops would lead to 
more bloodshed 
president bush cited noriegas declaration friday of a state of 
war as a reason for the invasion but takiff vehemently denied the 
general ever declared war on the united states 
noriegas us attorneys had agreed to publicly resign if he 
declared war and closely examined a copy of the text in which he 
apparently made the declaration takiff said 
what was said by noriega and by the national assembly was that 
because of events the country was living as if they were in a 
state of war he said we were satisfied that he had never 
declared war on the united states 
no one no matter how strained the context could consider 
that a declaration of war said takiff acknowledging that he did 
not know if noriega had departed from his prepared text in his 
speech to the assembly 
rubino said the drug charges against noriega were politically 
motivated 
before the united states used the cia in a covert way to 
topple governments now they are using indictment diplomacy 
rubino said 
former us attorney robert merkle who brought the tampa 
indictment against noriega and now practices law in clearwater 
said the military dictator is just another criminal 
the indictments were not instigated by the state department 
and they were not brought for any political purpose whatsoever 
merkle said all this yammering about indictment for political 
purposes is pure hogwash 
a trial is scheduled jan 8 in miami for two of noriegas 
codefendants but prosecutors had requested a continuance before 
wednesdays actions because they need more time to prepare their 
case 
the government will come to court with strong evidence against 
general noriega said richard gregorie the former chief 
assistant us attorney who presented the miami indictment to a 
grand jury in february 1988 
in the two indictments noriega is charged with accepting 10 
million in bribes from medellin cartel drug traffickers to protect 
smugglers and cocaine shipments launder cash and supply drug 
laboratories he faces up to 145 years in prison and more than 11 
million in fines if convicted 
if noriegas not rounded up soon he could probably go to cuba 
or nicaragua or he could start up a guerrilla movement with all 
the arms he has stashed away said luis endara a cousin of 
panamas new president guillermo endara

a legislator was convicted wednesday 
of spying for communist north korea and sentenced to 15 years in 
prison 
judge hong sukje dismissed rep suh kyungwons claims he was 
tortured to make false confessions that he was a spy for south 
koreas archenemy 
it was hard to find evidence to support the claims of torture 
considering the confessions signed by the defendant during an 
interrogation by prosecutors hong said 
the sentence had been expected to be heavier but the judge said 
the breakdown of the cold war was taken into consideration 
the defense counsel criticized the verdict as improper and said 
the ruling would be appealed the prosecution which had sought 
life imprisonment for suh also said it would appeal the maximum 
penalty for espionage is death 
suh had told the court that during a 50day investigation by the 
agency for national security planning the government intelligence 
organization he was forced to make false confessions that he had 
spied for north korea 
he said he had been denied contact with lawyers during the 
period and kept awake for many days government officials denied 
the charges 
also wednesday riot police firing tear gas stormed a university 
campus in seoul to break up a rally by hundreds of students 
demanding the release of im chongsuk a jailed radical student 
leader 
about 700 students throwing firebombs and rocks fought police 
for two hours in and around yonsei university in the third day of 
campus protests several students were taken away by police but no 
figures were available on arrests or injuries 
im was chairman of the national council of student 
representatives a nationwide antigovernment antius 
organization 
the spy case was generally considered the most serious in recent 
south korean history because it involved a national lawmaker with 
ongoing contact with communist north korea suh admitted he visited 
north korea but denied he was a spy 
suh a farmerturned politician was convicted of espionage and 
leaking state secrets to north korea 
the judge said overwhelming evidence indicated suh 52 secretly 
visited north korean leader kim il sung last year received 
120000 from communist agents and had ongoing contact and 
communications with the communist nation all in violation of the 
national security law 
the judge also ordered suh to forfeit 49000 in unspent funds 
allegedly from north korea 
the judge in handing down the sentence said it was taken 
into consideration that international trends have turned from the 
cold war era to an atmosphere of reconciliation since his suhs 
visit to the north and the seoul government has been pursuing an 
active northern policy aimed at easing tensions 
he said the state secrets leaked by suh to north korea were not 
sensitive but said suh contacted north korea before his 1988 
election to the national assembly as well as after 
after suhs arrest june 28 a dozen lawmakers businessmen and 
aides were questioned or jailed by national security agents 
twotime presidential candidate kim daejung leader of the 
leading opposition party for peace and democracy was indicted for 
allegedly failing to report suhs visit to north korea kim denied 
it and suh was expelled from the party 
suhs aide pang yangkyun was convicted of being an accessory 
wednesday and sentenced to seven years in prison six others were 
given suspended sentences ranging from 10 months to one year for 
failing to report suhs trip to north korea as is required by law

investigators probing mail bombs that killed a 
federal judge and a civil rights lawyer are examining anonymous 
letters mailed last summer that threatened the federal judiciary 
the fbi said thursday 
the letters which surfaced in jackson miss milwaukee 
minneapolis and an undisclosed location in california may be an 
important clue in the fbiled probe of the two fatal mailbombs in 
the south said fbi spokesman greg jones 
we are examining those letters to try to determine whether or 
not there is a link between those threats in august and the matters 
at hand today jones said 
the bombs killed judge robert s vance of the 11th us circuit 
court of appeals and robert e robinson a savannah ga alderman 
and civil rights lawyer other parcel bombs were found at the 11th 
circuit court in atlanta and the jacksonville fla naacp office 
the fbi says it believes all four similarly packaged bombs were 
mailed from locations in georgia the bombs were similarly 
constructed of nails and explosives authorities say 
television stations in jackson miss and milwaukee received 
letters bearing aug 21 atlanta postmarks that was the day before 
a teargas cannister was thrown into the naacp headquarters in 
atlanta injuring eight people 
jones refused to discuss the contents of the letters but he said 
they were similar in content 
the ones received by wapttv in jackson and witi in milwaukee 
were titled declaration of war against the 11th circuit court 
of appeals according to copies made available by the stations 
they threatened poison gas attacks on heavily populated areas 
until widespread terror forces the court to adopt the impartial 
and equitable treatment of all as its highest priority 
the justice department said tuesday that the investigation is 
concentrating on racial motivations for the killings and the bomb 
incidents 
fbi director william sessions said investigators are checking 
vances court docket the director said he wouldnt be surprised if 
a decision vance once made motivated the killing 
vance ruled in favor of the jacksonville naacp on sept 15 in a 
school desegregation case 
jones said all four letters were examined last summer by the fbi 
crime laboratory in washington but yielded no physical clues such 
as fingerprints us marshals in the various jurisdictions where 
the letters were received were told of the threats he said

moldavian delegates worried about their ethnic 
brethren in romania asked the soviet congress on wednesday to 
appeal for reason and order there 
ion drutse a wellknown moldavian poet said the stalinist 
regime of president nicolae ceausescu might embark on a new wave of 
repression against romanians seeking greater democracy 
it would cost him nothing to build his palace of the skulls of 
his subjects drutse told a reporter in the lobby of the 
kremlins palace of congresses 
antigovernment protests began last weekend in timisoara a city 
of 350000 people in transylvania western romania estimates of 
the number of people killed by ceausescus security forces reach 
the thousands 
soviet moldavia a small repubic of about 4 million people is 
on romanias eastern border moldavians are essentially ethnic 
romanians whose territory has gone back and forth last falling 
into the soviet sphere during world war ii the declaration 
proposed by the moldavian legislators expresses hope that all 
problems will be solved in the framework of reason and order and 
through dialogue between the romanian government and population 
drutse said 
moldavians said they asked the congress leadership to put the 
declaration up for a vote but it had not been done by wednesday 
evening 
drutse said he believed passing the declaration could help ease 
tension in romania because every tyrant is afraid of something 
the soviet union has made no move toward intervening in its 
allys affairs 
foreign ministry spokesman vadim perfiliev said wednesday a 
massive flow of information made it hard to judge what was 
happening in romania but if reports of loss of life were 
confirmed this is a reason for profound regret 
official media have taken a critical tone toward ceausescus 
stalinist regime

the bush adminstration argued wednesday that 
the us invasion of panama was legal under both domestic and 
international law but some lawyers who have tried warpowers cases 
disagreed 
secretary of state james baker cited article 51 of the united 
nations charter that gives nations the right to act in selfdefense 
and a similar provision of the organization of american states 
treaty as the legal basis for the invasion 
article 21 of the oas treaty gives the united states the right 
to protect its citizens installations and institutions the 
secretary said 
baker also cited the terms of the panama canal treaty that give 
the united states the right to exercise force to protect the canal 
to keep it operating 
attorney general dick thornburgh advised president bush about 
the legality of the operation before it was launched said justice 
department spokesman david runkel 
thornburgh believes there is a legal basis for this action 
being taken under us law runkel said it is my understanding 
there is clearly legal authority under both us law and 
international law 
but two attorneys for the center for constitutional rights a 
liberal new yorkbased civil liberties group disagree 
id say its clearly illegal under the un charter and the oas 
charter said attorney jules lobel who is also a law professor 
at the university of pittsburgh 
the united states doesnt have the right to unilaterally 
decide to overthrow another governent by the use of force lobel 
said nothing that the president said today or the secretary of 
state said would give the the united states such a right 
lobel said the united states must show it is acting in 
selfdefense for the invasion to be legal under the un charter and 
the oas treaty 
i dont think that can be based on some speculated threat that 
american citizens might be endangered lobel said baker had 
cited an intelligence report that panamanian gen manuel antonio 
noreiga was poised to attack americans 
if american citizens might be endangered the obvious thing to 
do is to protect them and evacuate them not overthrow the 
government lobel said 
both lobel and david cole another attorney for the center said 
the invasion also violated the warpowers provision of the 
constitution which requires congressional approval of the 
deployment of troops in this fashion 
i think the intent of the framers of the constitution is 
clear if the united states is going to offensively use military 
force abroad it must be approved by congress and not by four 
leaders in congress lobel said 
as a purely technical constitutional matter the president 
does not have the authority to do what he did cole said as a 
matter of legal and political reality if congress doesnt try to 
stop him i think its unlikely the courts would 
yale university law professor harold koh voiced caution about 
the invasion saying the rationale of protecting the securityof 
the canal must be limited to making sure there is no damage to the 
canal or some impairment of the security of the canal 
it cant be an allpurpose justification of wideranging 
actions to restructure the government koh said 
koh also expressed skepticism about justifying the invasion as 
an effort to arrest noriega as a matter of international law 
there is a danger in converting political action into socalled 
crime fighting action

civil rights leaders said wednesday 
theyve made progress in this northeast florida city but the 
mailing of a bomb to naacp headquarters recalls recent racial 
tensions that had begun to fade 
the bomb disarmed here tuesday was similar to devices which 
killed a federal appeals court judge and a savannah ga civil 
rights leader 
bombs mailed to the 11th circuit court of appeals in atlanta and 
to the jacksonville office of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people were disarmed without causing any 
damage or injuries 
possible links to naacp school desegregation efforts have been 
identified in all four cases leading to theories that a racist 
group may be responsible 
racial tensions were heightened here in september when three 
black city council members were ordered arrested after they walked 
out of a meeting to protest lack of funding for predominantly black 
areas in the city budget 
one of them attorney deitra micks was arrested in a city hall 
womens room and hauled back to the council meeting in handcuffs 
the arrests were ordered by city council president tillie fowler 
who is white so the council would have a quorum 
and all of a sudden this happened so it just brings up this 
whole issue of race again the rev john newman a black 
minister said wednesday jacksonville is sitting on a racial 
powder keg im sorry to report 
black leaders said they were angry about tuesdays discovery of 
the bomb but it will not deter them from their work 
we will go on with our business as usual we will not let this 
incident stop us from doing the job we have set out to do said 
willye dennis the local president of the naacp she received the 
explosive package monday but didnt have time to open it then 
she had a more optimistic view of racial tension in the city 
weve come a long way in jacksonville but we have a long way 
to go she said 
city council member terry wood who is white said he believes 
tensions have eased since the walkout but there are elements on 
both sides who can point to certain events and say improvements are 
superficial said wood 
newman pastor of the mount calvary baptist church said the 
organization has received criticism from both whites and blacks for 
its positions 
on one hand we have threats from whites perhaps racists who 
want to destroy us because of positions of ideology and on the 
other hand to try to stop drugs we have threats from blacks who 
happened to be drug dealers who want to blow us away newman said 
the fbi said wednesday that all four bombs had georgia postmarks 
or return addresses 
fbi agent william hinshaw in charge of the atlanta office said 
the first parcel bomb addressed to federal judge robert s vance 
was mailed last thursday from newnan ga to vances home in 
mountain brook ala a suburb of birmingham vance was killed and 
his wife was seriously injured 
the bomb that killed savannah ga alderman and attorney robert 
e robinson on monday is believed to have been mailed friday from

friday from macon he said 
another bomb was mailed saturday from the atlanta area to the 
11th us circuit court of appeals clerks office in atlanta 
hinshaw said 
the investigation is concentrating in part on possible links to 
naacp school desegregation efforts 
the 11th circuit hears federal appeals from georgia florida 
and alabama including desegregation cases 
vance an 11th circuit judge wrote the courts september 
ruling in favor of the jacksonville naacp in its desegregation suit 
against jacksonville schools 
robinson was the savannah naacps local counsel and helped 
with an naacp suit against the savannah schools the naacp lost 
that case at the 11th circuit and the threejudge panel did not 
include vance 
robinson also had advised the jacksonville naacp chapter in 
its desegregation case according to a jacksonville activist the

president bush said wednesday he ordered the 
military strike in panama to seize manuel antonio noriega and end 
reckless threats and attacks against americans noriega eluded 
capture and the administration put a 1 million bounty on his head 
even though noriega dropped out of sight the united states 
said as a practical matter we have decapitated him from the 
dictatorship 
the white house announced a 1 million reward for information 
leading to his capture in addition panamanians were offered 150 
for each firearm they surrendered 
pentagon officials declared the operation in panama a military 
success saying noriegas forces mostly had fled or were fleeing 
though some fighting continued 
reaction from congress both democratic and republican was 
mostly favorable 
bush hoping to break a nearly twoyear stalemate with noriega 
dispatched 9500 soldiers and marines to back up the 13000 us 
troops already in panama for a 1 am assault against army bases 
and the generals headquarters 
in a televised address from the oval office a somber bush told 
the nation i took this action only after reaching the conclusion 
that every other avenue was closed and the lives of american 
citizens were in grave danger 
in the fighting codenamed operation just cause by the 
pentagon 15 us military personnel were killed many more were 
wounded and one was missing in addition a woman dependent was 
killed the pentagon said 
four helicopters crashed believed to have been brought down by 
gunfire 
noting the loss of american lives bush said no president 
takes such action lightly 
lt gen tom kelly army deputy chief of staff said one dead 
american is too many but thank god the numbers dont appear too 
high right now he said it looks like the organized resistance 
is a thing of the past 
bush up much of the night monitored the fighting in panama he 
took a break wednesday evening to attend a white house christmas 
party 
some americans were reported taken hostage in the marriott hotel 
in panama city late in the day us marines arrived at the site 
and escorted many americans out of the building 
kelly called noriega a crafty devil and said he had not been 
spotted wednesday 
he said us forces had observed noriega several times on 
tuesday we thought we had a pretty good idea of where he was 
last night we went there and he wasnt there 
he has gone to ground kelly said even so he expressed 
confidence noriega would be located saying we have every spigot 
turned on to find him he said there was no indication noriega 
had left panama 
the general said much of the pdf panamanian defense forces 
is fleeing in the face of the us military units 
he added we have a concern that they have gone off into the 
jungle there is every chance that we will go off after them 
kelly said he expected the canal to reopen thursday 
bush said the united states would withdraw its force as soon as 
possible secretary of state james a baker iii said he could not 
speculate how long us troops would remain in action 
bush was roundly criticized when he kept us forces on the 
sidelines during an unsuccessful coup attempt against noriega on 
oct 3 
in contrast congressional leaders generally supported the 
presidents decision to use force 
when there is the engagement of us forces in the field it 
behooves all of us to give that support house speaker thomas 
foley said 
it was made necessary by the reckless actions of gen 
noriega said senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
but rep don edwards dcalif called bushs action a 
triggerhappy act of gunboat diplomacy which violates the 
constitution and sen claiborne pell dri chairman of the 
senate foreign relations committee said bush should not have acted 
without the support and aid of other central american nations 
william j bennett the director of national drug control 
policy said of noriega i think we can safely conclude that this 
ends his career as a drug trafficker hes not running drugs hes 
not running panama hes just running and thats good

the organization of american states met in emergency session at 
the request of panamanian ambassador jose maria cabrera a holdover 
from noriegas regime 
he told the gathering under no circumstances will we accept 
some supposed leaders who are puppets imposed by the united 
states referring to the provisional government headed by 
guillermo endara and recognized by the bush administration 
endara asked the oas in a letter to recognize lawrence chewning 
fabrega as his designated representative but the members decided to 
recognize cabrera instead 
peru withdrew its ambassador to the united states in protest 
until the invading troops withdraw according to a statement 
from the peruvian embassy 
bush laying out the reasons for the military action cited 
noriegas declaration last friday of a state of war the slaying of 
an american officer last saturday and the manhandling of an 
american serviceman and his wife 
gen noriegas reckless threats and attacks upon americans in 
panama created an imminent danger to the 35000 american citizens 
in panama bush said as president i have no higher obligation 
than to safeguard the lives of american citizens 
and that is why i directed our armed forces to protect the 
lives of american citizens in panama and bring gen noriega to 
justice in the united states 
with noriega on the run bush said the united states was lifting 
economic sanctions against panama and freeing panamanian assets 
frozen in us banks 
baker said bush decided sunday to use force against noriega 
after that decision was made baker said the united states 
received intelligence reports that noriega might launch a commando 
attack against americans in an urban residential neighborhood 
while saying it was unclear whether the report was reliable 
baker told reporters that if americans had been killed or 
terrorized you would be asking us today why didnt you act to 
prevent this kind of violence against our citizens 
the secretary added im not going to tell you that the crisis 
in panama has been totally resolved but manuel noriega who 
was yesterdays maximum leader is todays hunted fugitive 
ever since noriega was indicted in florida on drugtrafficking 
charges in february 1988 the united states has been trying to 
force him from power through economic sanctions and diplomatic 
pressure 
the soviet union condemned the action saying the united states 
must immediately stop its armed intervention british prime 
minister margaret thatcher praised it as a courageous decision 
and said someone has to uphold democracy 
former president ronald reagan who had unsuccessfully tried to 
force noriega from power said in los angeles there comes a time 
when a president must take action that time has come 
defense secretary dick cheney said the planning for a military 
strike had been in existence for some time it was one of the 
first items i was briefed on when he took office last spring 
gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff said 
of noriega as a practical matter we have decapitated him from 
the dictatorship of this country and he is now a fugitive and will 
be treated as such we will chase him and we will find him 
at bushs suggestion vice president dan quayle called the two 
newly installed panamanian vice presidents billy ford and ricardo 
arias calderon to congratulate them and say he looked forward to 
visiting them in a free and independent panama said a spokesman 
david beckwith 
quayle is considered likely to attend a presidential 
inauguration in honduras on jan 27 and sources said a visit to 
panama then is under consideration

and the people who were there who may harm them know that were 
present and were armed and well come after them 
q general do you plan to get dependents or other us 
personnel out of panama now 
gen kelly not immediately we have not implemented any plan 
along those lines 
q general with some of your goals accomplished are there any 
thought is there any thought being given now to withdrawing some 
us troops 
gen kelly my boss indicated i think this morning that there 
were no timelines that we were going to stay there long enough to 
get the job done i dont think i see this as a long longterm 
effort us troops in panama combat troops for months or years 
but i think that its going to take a little while to help the 
country get back on its feet youve got to realize theyve gone 
through an awful time over the last couple of years with noriega 
who has done a great deal to break down the social fabric of the 
country and weve got to try and help them rebuild it 
q general 
q can you give an update on casualties an update on casualty 
numbers 
gen kelly yeah i can okay weve lost so far four 
helicopters but three of those four will probably be and this is 
an assertion on my part repairable and the fourth one if we get 
it back its in the water may be and that was one apache and 
three observation helicopters we have had 11 military people one 
marine i believe the rest soldiers killed 59 wounded and one 
missing and i mentioned the one dependent who was dead you know 
one one dead american is too many but thank god the numbers 
dont appear too high right now 
q do you know how many of those were accidental general 
gen kelly to my knowledge none of them were accidental 
q general on a scale of one to ten how successful would you 
say this operation has been so far 
gen kelly oh ten and youre asking the wrong guy 
laughter i think that it is among the most professionally 
executed operations that i have seen in 33 years of military 
service recall that the that the socalled war status was 
declared on friday the marine was killed on saturday the family 
beating and harrassment occurred on saturday we made a decision 
and in almost no time at all we were putting our paratroopers and 
our rangers on airplanes and sending them down there i dont know 
that theres another country in the world that can do that i do 
know that im a pretty biased guy when it comes to the us 
military and i think that we have the finest leaders we have 
available running things in panama 
q general kelly following that if i could sir in the 
aftermath of grenada can you tell us do you have any reports yet 
of perhaps communications gear that couldnt communicate back and 
forth men dropped in the wrong place those kinds of problems 
repeating 
gen kelly we have indications that human beings in panama have 
made mistakes you know history is replete with that as far as 
major glitches are concerned ted and i have been on the in the 
nmcc on the communications there has never been a second that we 
havent had direct voice communications with the commander and his 
staff in panama theres never been a second that they havent 
been in communication with gen steiner the southern task force 
commander jtf south joint task force south and no we have not 
had those kind of glitches 
q did you have any problems with any kind of weather 
gen kelly no no we had weather problems of course up in 
fort bragg and pope air force base trying to get out yesterday we 
had an ice storm and we had one heck of a time getting the 
airplanes deiced and we had problems out of travis today with 
fog that slowed us down getting out 
q general on that point 
gen kelly but we still made the tots time over target 
q would you like to have started this operation sooner would 
you like to have had it conducted sooner than one this morning 
gen kelly if you could wave a magic wand and get the mac 
military airlift command aircraft together and do all those kinds 
of things i would like it to have started just the second the 
president said we could go we were in a position where we had to 
tell him that it takes so many hours to get that many airplanes 
together because theyre all around the world and we dont have 
an excess number of those aircraft 
q general 
q general on the amount of equipment weve thrown into this 
fight in the way of planes tanks helicopters what force in 
addition to manpower are we actually bringing to bear here 
gen kelly reasonable force i am a tanker we have four tanks 
in panama and theyre sheridans which as you may recall are 
light vehicles that have a 152mm gun and were originally designed 
primarily to fire a shillelagh missile they came out of the 82nd 
airborne division and thats the only toampe battalion in the army 
left with the sheridans because the m1 tanks are too heavy to be 
airdropped

<TEXT>
q were those flown down yesterday 
gen kelly no they went down sometime earlier we also had six 
apache helicopters in panama that is a modern daynight 
allweather helicopter that represented a real combat multiplier 
we had some gunships air force ac130 gunships and other 
capabilities down there all of which stood us in very good stead 
q general how many casualties from that air drop did we take 
any 
gen kelly i know of no casualties that occurred as a result of 
the air drop 
q thats a pretty hairy thing though to drop what 20 
planes worth of airborne at night 
gen kelly oh no there was a whole lot more than 20 we 
wouldnt want to give you the exact number no 20 aircraft came 
out of fort bragg a whole lot more came out of other places to 
carry the rangers only the airborne from the 82nd came out of 
bragg 
q well how well give us a little better idea of that 
landing zone and everything what happened there i mean this was 
did you light the area with the strips 
gen kelly yeah they landed right on tocumen airfield you 
know thats nice and wide and open and all that 
q general what kind of problems do the dignity battalions pose 
for you in panama city tonight 
gen kelly thats hard to say youre asking me to predict the 
future and thats really an intelligence question so ill turn it 
over to my colleague laughter 
q could we ask you sir 
adm sheafer weve had there is some about 18 dignity 
battalions they vary in size from as few as a couple of dozen 
people up to about 250 their military training is generally pretty 
inadequate 
q inadequate 
adm sheafer inadequate theyre great with people who are 
unarmed but when it comes to fighting uniformed soldiers that are 
well trained theyre not very good and they are throughout many 
parts of panama city at this time we have seen activity 
principally between the areas that general kelly mentioned rio 
hato in the west and fort cimarron in the east by about roughly 
nine of these 18 battalions and we have seen nothing out of the 
other nine 
q sir general kelly was telling us in the when he was 
outlining the other units that were outside and speaking of 
noriega forces that there was a great deal of fleeing in the face 
of the americans does your intelligence suggest that will happen 
in panama city or are you expecting to get into a rough 
streettostreet 
adm sheafer ill answer 
q inaudible which could lead to more casualties 
adm sheafer ill answer the question the same way he did 
youre asking me to predict the future and thats very difficult to 
do we simply dont know 
q like the rebellion for urban fighting when you said 
inaudible 
adm sheafer i mean you have to plan for the worst and hope 
for the best 
q are these guys armed arent these more unarmed rebels what 
kind of weapons 
adm sheafer they have in this case we have reports that some 
of the dignity batallions have been armed 
q what kind of weapons 
adm sheafer with rpgs and ak47s 
q can you give us an assessment of the difficulty it presents 
to you that noriega is still at large the difficulty in terms of 
stimulating the remaining pronoriega 
adm sheafer i dont think thats the right question the right 
question is the difficulty he has staying at large 
q but you dont feel that having him at large presents you with 
a different magnitude of problem because of what he represents i 
mean as you yourself have said hes a slippery fellow and 
gen kelly he is and right now mr noriega commands nothing 
he has no payroll he has no cronies except for possibly a small 
group of people who are loyal to him personally because he pays 
them he does not present us with a military problem his soldiers 
did not fight any more bravely over the past day because he was 
there or he wasnt there i think now that the structure of the pdf 
combat units has been reduced he is in deeper trouble i dont 
think hes deeply loved by the panamanian people i dont think i 
do think that if they they get an inkling of where he is theyre 
going to theyre going to let us know where he is or let the 
authorities in panama know where he is because recall that 
theyre the ones that did all the suffering while he was the 
dictator

guillermo endara sworn in wednesday 
as panamas president after a us invasion remains a gentle 
unassuming law professor despite his long struggle with his enemy 
gen manuel antonio noriega 
endaras eightparty opposition coalition united to oppose 
noriega in elections held on may 7 noriega supporters first tried 
to steal the election for his handpicked candidate carlos duque 
then annulled it 
when the vote count was halted endaras democratic opposition 
alliance ticket had a 31 lead over duque according to 
international observers who included former president jimmy carter 
our aspiration is justice democracy and liberty said 
endara in a wednesday broadcast on a clandestine radio network he 
said that president bush had promised us troops would be removed 
as early as possible 
opposition party officials persisted in calling endara mister 
presidentelect maintaining that the annulment was illegal 
after sept 1 when endara would have taken office he was referred 
to as mister president and us officials followed suit 
the staying power of panamas opposition has always been 
questioned noriega said they just wanted to make money in peace 
and would fold under serious challenge 
endara of the liberal authentic party and his two running 
mates ricardo arias calderon of the christian democratic party and 
guillermo ford of the national liberal republican movement formed 
an uneasy alliance whose only unifying theme was the defeat of 
noriega 
arias was by far the most popular in panama but he was also the 
most disliked by others he clearly felt he deserved the 
presidential domination but swallowed hard and took the first 
vicepresidential slot 
second vicepresidential candidate ford a businessman turned 
out to be the most charismatic of the three showing an earthy 
common touch despite his wealth as he developed a showmans style 
one problem the three will have to surmount is the way they took 
office many who disapproved of noriega will also disapprove of 
open massive united states intervention and critics say depending 
on big brother to solve all problems is a sign of weak 
character 
the three stayed out of sight all day wednesday their 
statements were broadcast on a radio network anchored by bosco 
ricardo vallarino from a strategic point in panama it was 
thought the point had to be on a us base because vallarino is a 
wellknown noriega opponent and faced censure from noriega 
supporters 
it was still uncertain how the tensions and compromises will 
work in practice but endara and his running mates established 
their willingness to sacrifice when men wearing noriegas dignity 
battalion tshirts beat them during a may 10 protest 
demonstration 
the spectacle of endara arias and ford being beaten bloody by 
pipewielding thugs flashed around the world in a scene that 
stamped noriega as the leader of a brutal regime endara spent his 
53rd birthday in a hospital bed 
they were not battalions and they have no dignity endara 
said in a hospital interview as supporters held up his bloodied 
guayabera a shortsleeved smocktype shirt favored by many latins 
he staged a hunger strike that occasioned brutal jests about 
diets from pronoriega newspapers because of his heft 
endaras opposition activities date back more than two decades 
to when he served in the national assembly under arnulfo arias 
madrid panamas grand old man of the opposition 
he was arias spokesman in panama until arias died in miami in 
1988 in selfimposed exile he used to speak almost dreamily of 
the day when arias would return as a sign of providence to lead 
the country 
endaras wife marcella died earlier this year they had a 
daughter also named marcella 
arias 52 is president of the christian democratic party he 
was a professor of philosophy at the university of panama he and 
his wife teresa have three children 
ford 53 and his wife dora have two children

two american women were held hostage 
at gunpoint in an airport terminal for more than six hours before 
they were freed by us soliders who bluffed the panamanian captors 
into believing that gen manuel noriega had been killed 
mary rebhan 24 of hollywood fla and tara king 25 of 
dallas told reporters they were used as shields to buy time for a 
group of noriega loyalists who holed up in a sweltering customs 
room at omar torrijos international airport when american forces 
moved in 
they had us in choke holds for most of the time said rebhan 
they made us kneel down and held guns to my back and to her 
head said king 
the two women said they had gone to the airport tuesday evening 
to pick up rebhans brother who was flying in for her wedding 
ceremony at the end of the month 
they were told his flight was delayed and went outside to wait 
in the car until about 1230 am wednesday when the bombs 
started to drop 
dashing inside the terminal the women were accosted by a group 
of about 30 armed men in civilian clothes when it was revealed the 
women were americans they were taken to a locked room 
a guy named sanchez was in charge rebhan said adding that 
two other men were addressed throughout the night as sarjinto 
or sergeant leading the women to believe they were members of the 
panamanian defense forces 
american troops began to arrive in force to take over the 
airport but the panamanians held them off with the women 
for six hours they made us keep shouting go away were 
americans theyre going to kill us and the children if you 
come rebhan said 
fake bombs were taped to their bodies one was a plastic bag 
stuffed with a pair of pants 
king said their captors turned the lights off in the room to 
confuse the americans rebhan said sanchez kept an uzi machine gun 
on her shoulder pointed at the door 
the woman who were both raised in the canal zone acted as 
translators between the americans and panamanians 
just before dawn the americans set a deadline of 630 for the 
men to surrender and told them they were surrounded and that gen 
noriega was already dead in fact noriegas whereabouts were not 
known 
the panamanians finally gave up leaving the room with the women 
held in front of them 
they were really afraid we could feel their hearts on our 
backs as they held us rebhan said 
but the women said they were at least equally frightened 
we were terrified king said i thought i was going to 
die 
rebhan speaking on the airport tarmac before hitching a ride 
with a pentagon press pool said she was acting calmly because it 
really hasnt hit me yet i just really want to get home 
rebhan whose father is the chief mechanical engineer for the 
panama canal said she planned to hold a church ceremony in panama 
on dec 30 she was married to jeff rebhan in a civil ceremony in 
warren ohio

youngsters calling santa claus over the past week 
may have been thinking of his sleigh and eight tiny reindeer but 
they got the people who keep 530mph fourengine military radar 
reconnaissance jets in the air 
and most of them will never know they got the wrong number 
the children got connected to technicians at boeings support 
center for specially equipped military aircraft 
this was quite a surprise when it started out said duane 
oberg developer with the airborne warning and control system or 
awacs fleet support system 
but after the first several calls we figured out what had 
happened and just started answering phones as if this was santas 
workshops 
hundreds of children got their lines crossed because of 
transposed numbers in a telephone listing in a national magazine 
boeing aerospace amp electronics spokesman elliot pulham said 
wednesday 
the aerospace branch of boeing specializes in missiles 
spacecraft and spy airplanes for some the ultimate toys 
he said the calls began about dec 13 and were winding down by 
the middle of this week after calls for santa were redirected 
the first youngsters might have been greeted with hi this is 
awacs fleet support central can i help you pulham said but the 
engineers lightened up and played along 
they were putting on their bonnets and would play santa 
whenever the children would call but they would give technical 
information when customers called he said 
the normal phone calls to the center are for technical 
assistance provided for those who fly service and repair the awacs 
aircraft which are loaded with sophisticated radar and other 
surveillance equipment 
there are only 60 such aircraft in operation built by boeing 
pulham said and the tollfree phone line is normally not busy 
the engineers didnt mind the distractions 
it was actually kind of fun oberg said definitely a 
break from what we normally do although i think some of our 
customers were a bit surprised when they called for radar or 
computer information and ended up talking to santas workshop 
pulham said the situation didnt get out of hand no matter what 
the children might have asked for 
we didnt promise anybody any cruise missiles or anything like 
that for christmas he said

for two days president bush masked his plan 
to oust panamas manuel antonio noriega with a studied show of 
businessasusual 
he gaily greeted guests at a white house christmas party just 
hours before the full scale military operation began 
outraged at the slaying of an american marine and concerned 
about quickly deteriorating conditions in panama city bush decided 
on sunday to mount the assault to topple noriegas regime 
administration officials said 
bush had been seriously mulling such a strike since the abortive 
oct 3 coup attempt against noriega officials said in fact the 
plan for a preemptive us move against noriega actually had been 
developed months earlier 
sources said one of the first to learn of the goahead was vice 
president dan quayle whom bush briefed at a brunch on sunday 
the president went over final plans for the assault at a tuesday 
afternoon session with quayle secretary of states james a baker 
iii defense secretary richard b cheney national security adviser 
brent scowcroft and colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
the oval office meeting in keeping with the secrecy shrouding 
the decision was billed by white house officials as a sssion 
between bush cheney and thornburgh on the role of the military 
in the war on drugs 
in keeping the decision so closely under wraps the onetime cia 
chief was following a familiar pattern of secrecy one also 
reflected in his sending clandestine highlevel missions to beijing 
and in keeping private for four months his plan for a mediterranean 
superpower summit 
bush attended white house christmas parties both monday and 
tuesday evenings buoyantly greeting guests and posing for 
photographs 
at tuesdays party scowcroft his deputy robert gates and white 
house chief of staff john sununu all put in brief appearances 
before returning to their offices to wait for the us military 
strike 
a day after he made the decision to use force in an attempt to 
topple noriega bush refused to rule out a military response in a 
monday interview with the associated press and other news agencies 
he expressed enormous frustration with noriegas continued 
strongarm tactics but otherwise he gave no hint at what was to 
come 
the businessasusual theme extended to other administration 
officials as well on tuesday public information officers at the 
pentagon went home at their regular quitting time 
and in the white house presidential press secretary marlin 
fitzwater was joined by a small group of reporters in his office to 
watch evening network news accounts of unannounced us troop 
movements to panama fitzwater said he knew nothing about the 
reports 
fitzwater on wednesday said the harrassment of americans in 
panama is what finally persuaded the president to use force 
the president was somber through the night tuesday night 
worried about the possiblity of casualties and anxious for any 
word of specific military progress 
bush watched fitzwaters announcement of the action on the 
television in his study near the oval office then made notes on a 
5inch by 7inch blue notepad as he talked to various world leaders 
by phone the spokesman said 
bush cancelled virtually all of his scheduled events and 
meetings on wednesday so he could concentrate on the action in 
panama receiving frequent military updates through the day and 
evening 
one event he did not cancel fitzwater said was yet another 
christmas party scheduled for wednesday evening 
at the pentagon secretary of defense cheney told reporters that 
the order went out late on sunday to implement a plan that had 
been in existence for some time it was one of the first items i 
was briefed on when i became secretary of defense last spring 
powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff suggested a 
concern that noriega might do something to jeopardize the panama 
canal in the absence of a us strike and a congressional 
intelligence source cited reports in recent months of a 
deterioration in noriegas mental health and heavy drinking 
in any event bush criticized in some quarters for being 
indecisive and timid in failing to capitalize on last octobers 
coup attempt apparently was determined not to let another 
opportunity pass 
bush informed congressional leaders by phone of his plan about 
an hour before the first shots were fired senate republican leader 
bob dole of kansas said bush phoned him at 1115 pm he said 
hed appreciate my support dole said he gave it to him 
bush stayed in the oval office until 405 am est spending 
much of the time phoning allied and central american leaders to let 
them know what he was doing before heading to his personal 
residence for a brief sleep before his 7 am address to the nation

it may be the newsbysatellite era but when 
the major networks began coverage of wednesdays us military 
strike in panama shortly after midnight the reports from their 
correspondents there came by phone 
the reason gunmen loyal to gen manuel antonio noriegia barred 
them from a satellite transmission network executives said no 
pictures of the us attacks results or street scenes in panama 
city were seen until after 9 am est and then they were on tape 
not live 
nbc got embroiled in a small war of its own complaints from 
wtn a londonbased tv news agency serving cbs abc and cnn that 
nbc had aired nearly four minutes of wtn footage without 
permission an nbc spokesman said that was inadvertent and that 
nbc anchor tom brokaw told viewers the same thing 
but wtn president kenneth a coyte in a letter to nbc news 
president michael gartner protested in the strongest possible 
terms nbcs action calling it a cynical breach of professional 
standards 
however nbc officials said all four us networks shortly 
afterwards agreed to pool their panama footage by midmorning the 
networks simultaneously were airing longdistance night shots of 
military buildings burning white tracer bullets shooting 
occasionally shooting skyward and shadowy gunmen on streets 
the networks also aired early daytime shots of army helicopters 
landing two air force c130 transports flying several thousand 
feet above panama citys marriott hotel and us paratroopers 
faces daubed in dark green camouflages taking positions near 
trees signs and parks 
at times the war on tv took on an aliceinwonderland quality 
brokaw interviewing a panama city resident by phone on the 
today show asked him what local broadcasters were reporting 
eloi benedetti said he was watching reports of the us strike 
on the us armed forces tv station which also carried cnn brokaw 
asked if the station was describing what was going on on the ground 
in panama 
well benedetti said theyre actually relaying the cnn 
broadcast 
it was a risky story for correspondents cnn used a stringer 
berta thayer and producers some among the crowd of journalists 
at the marriott hotel reported that gunmen waiting outside had 
threatened them made it too dangerous to leave the hotel 
four men thought to be noriega loyalists seized two network 
producers in the hotel lobby they later released one abcs robert 
campos several hours later abc said cbs said it was checking 
unconfirmed reports that the other producer jon meyersohn who 
worked for cbs also had been freed 
nbcs ed rabel reporting from the marriott fled to a nearby 
us military installation after gunwaving goons threatened 
his life according to nbc news senior vice president joseph 
angotti running nbcs operation here 
they said they didnt want him or any other gringos around 
that if they found him the next time they came around theyll kill 
him angotti said 
the us military operation against noriega was accompanied by a 
pentagon news pool that included nbcs fred francis pool reporter 
for the networks one of his reports shown on cnn included a 
discussion with cnn anchor bernard shaw of what hed seen 
the reporters were flown in on air force transports but not 
early enough one cbs executive said 
we stll dont have information why the pool didnt go in with 
an early wave of soldiers or why they were held back until 
pretty late in the game said don decesare cbs vice president 
for news coverage 
the pool system was developed after a controversy over the ban 
on reporters accompanying the initial phases of the us attack in 
grenada in 1982 this groups tv gear included a portable satellite 
ground station 
but even though reporters were flown around the battle areas in 
helicopters it appeared late wednesday afternoon that unexplained 
snags had developed and thered be no pool pictures from the 
transmitter decesare said 
they have the capacity to feed video reports he said 
however we still have yet to receive anything 
he and his nbc and abc counterparts were relieved when at about 
35 minutes before their networks first evening newscasts the 
pools videotape footage began coming in from panama some shots 
were taken over a the shoulder of a helicopter door gunner

the soviet union used language reminiscent of the 
cold war on wednesday to denounce the us military attack in 
panama leaders from europe and latin america generally opposed the 
us move but said it had to be done 
britains prime minister margaret thatcher was one of the few 
heads of state who fully supported president bushs attempt to 
capture gen manuel antonio noriega someone has to uphold 
democracy she said 
angry condemnation came from peru where president alan garcia 
announced he was withdrawing his ambassador from washington until 
us troops leave panama 
nicaragua called a military alert and asked for an emergency 
meeting of the un security council 
libyan leader col moammar gadhafi said the assault made nero 
and hitler look like angels he met the soviet ambassador and gave 
him a letter for president mikhail s gorbachev on the invasion 
asking moscow to live up to its international responsibilities 
libyas official news agency jana said 
in manila filipino congressional leaders on thursday asked 
president corazon aquino to recognize the democratically elected 
government in panama of guillermo endara who was sworn in as 
president after us troops went in on dec 1 us jets flew air 
cover to help the manila government fight off a coup attempt 
the official soviet news agency tass said of the invasion 
this action is an example of notorious gunboat diplomacy which 
has been used for decades by the united states in an attempt to 
turn latin american and caribbean nations into its back yard 
despite soviet anger foreign ministry spokesman vadim p 
perfiliev played down the impact on improved superpower relations 
we are now in a situation where an event in the east or the 
west is not perceived is not evaluated in terms of confrontation 
between east and west perfiliev said in moscow 
but perfiliev said the us action violated us charters and 
should be condemned by the international community and must 
immediately stop 
the 12european economic community did not issue a joint 
statement 
france is the current president of the community and a french 
foreign ministry spokesman said there were no plans for a statement 
the french government said it could not approve of the us 
recourse to force but that it nonetheless backed the fight 
against drugs and supported democratic movements everywhere 
in london mrs thatcher said she had spoken with bush on the 
phone and told him her government supported him 
someone has to uphold democracy there were terrible things 
happening in panama it was a tyranny mrs thatcher said 
it was a courageous decision to send in american troops she 
said 
the opposition labor party criticized the us move in angry 
exchanges later in the house of commons it accused mrs thatcher of 
humiliating britain by supporting the united states 
canada said the us action set a dangerous precedent but 
expressed sympathy 
what would you have us do asked canadian prime minister 
brian mulroney here youve got a drug runner and thug running 
the country he declares war on the united states he assassinates 
some innocent american citizens 
among other western allies the dutch government said it also 
sympathized with bush but spain which has close ties throughout 
latin america deeply lamented the us move 
venezuela summed up many reactions by saying it opposed the 
intervention but also opposed noriegas regime 
during a meeting of regional leaders in colombia venezuela 
blamed a lack of an effective and firm response by our 
countries in the past for the situation in panama 
the organization of american states which has tried to pressure 
noriega to step down convened an emergency meeting in washington 
at which the panamanian delegate jose maria cabrera called on the 
group to condemn the brutal and criminal aggression 
it is not possible while panamanian citizens are still being 
massacred without distinction of age sex or status for this 
organization to keep its arms crossed he said 
china made no overt comment its official xinhua news agency 
issued brief reports that said noriega was safe and would 
fight for the nations sovereignty 
japan was noncommittal foreign minister taro nakayama said in 
tokyo he hoped the confrontation would end soon and a democratic 
government take over in panama 
japans asahi shimbun newspaper said in an editorial prepared 
for thursdays editions it is highly questionable that the global 
community will buy the us explanation for its action 
the difference in strength between america and panama is like 
that between an elephant and an ant the united states should not 
be surprised if its advance into panama is regarded by the rest of 
the world as a blatant invasion of panamas independence and 
sovereignty 
in iran official tehran radio said the united states wanted to 
replace noriega with a government acceptable to itself so as to 
continue its domination over the panama canal and its arrogant 
hegemony over central and south america 
gadhafi who has been accused by official washington in the past 
of promoting international terrorism said of the us action i 
could not find any expression in the dictionary to describe the 
degree of anger toward the savagery of official terrorism and 
powermania 
he said the assault makes nero and hitler angels compared to 
the western mongols and nazis of the americans and their allies 
jana reported monitored in rome

thousands of lockheed aircraft corp 
employees watched an sr71 blackbird thunder overhead wednesday as 
the spy plane flew toward retirement after nearly 25 years of 
topsecret supersonic service 
among the lockheed workers watching the flybys near the burbank 
airport and a lockheed research and development facility near santa 
clarita was clarence kelly johnson 79 lockheeds legendary 
aircraft designer 
johnson who is in poor health has been living at an 
undisclosed hospital said richard stadler a lockheed spokesman 
the black deltawinged reconnaissance jet which is heading for 
retirement under pentagon cutbacks was first flown on dec 22 
1964 said bill spaniel a lockheed spokesman 
spaniel declined to give further details about the maiden 
flight saying that much information about the 
intelligencegathering aircraft remains classified 
it was the first time many people had seen the black 
sophisticated aircraft even among lockheed employees said 
stadler who watched three flybys in burbank from the roof of a 
lockheed building 
its amazing stadler said some of us get used to the 
fact of the aircraft being around and then you realize that a lot 
of people have never seen one before 
the sr71 was developed to succeed the u2 spy plane which came 
to symbolize the cold war after american pilot francis gary powers 
was shot down in 1960 during a reconnaissance flight high above the 
soviet union 
like the u2 the blackbird was conceived by engineers working 
at lockheeds advanced development projects a highly innovative 
program organized by johnson that gained renown as the skunk works 
blackbirds on reconnaissance flights were frequently targeted by 
groundtoair missiles and jet interceptors during the vietnam war 
lockheed officials said 
but attempts to shoot down blackbirds have all failed primarily 
because the jet was able to outrun its attackers at speeds three 
times faster than the speed of sound and was able to fly at 
altitudes higher than 85000 feet officials said 
while many of the sr71s exact capabilities have remained 
secret it has held several speed and altitude records for nearly a 
quarter century 
one public record held by a blackbird was a 15000mile flight 
completed in 10 hours which works out to a speed of about 1429 
mph background material provided by lockheed however says the 
twinengine jet is capable of speeds in excess of 2000 mph 
the capability of radar infrared cameras and other 
intelligencegathering sensors aboard the sr71 also is classified 
however officials have acknowledged that the pictures produced by 
such equipment are sharp enough that one can read the numbers on a 
license plate photographed from 15 miles away

q excuse me general what 
adm sheafer let me add one thing to what he said the comments 
he made about payday should not be taken lightly when you retire 
from the pdf after 26 years of service you retire on 100 percent 
of your salary 
q general i know you said you dont like making predictions 
but how long do you think this mopup operation will take and what 
role do you see the us military playing down in panama say 
over the next one to two weeks 
gen kelly i would say that the mopup is difficult to figure 
we had hoped to be able to have it done within about three days 
the role we will play is assisting the panamanians who are a 
sovereign state and have a president now who will begin to 
function im certain in maintaining order initially and 
recapturing control of their institutions like the police you 
know the panamanian police are no different now than they were 
before i think they have to get organized and get decent 
leadership but they can go back out and maintain order 
q excuse me if i can follow up will us soldiers be playing 
a police function down there after the mopup 
gen kelly thats conceivable we have some mps down there 
they have police training and we may have to assist the 
panamanians for as short a period of time as possible thats a 
policy decision thats not my decision and then and well get 
guidance on it 
q its always been presumed general kelly that the area 
outside the city of panama along the costa rican border has been 
the most friendly towards noriega and its always been speculated 
that if he got into trouble he would run into that area have you 
secured that area 
gen kelly we were not going to tell you everything that 
weve done but the preponderance of our forces right now in the 
areas that i laid out for you initially where the major combat 
elements of the pdf are i think that the the first thing we 
felt we had to do was take on the pdf regular units in the vicinity 
of the capital and to assist the panamanian people the vast 
majority of whom live there as you know in reestablishing their 
democracy and supporting the duly elected government of the 
country when thats done and hopefully that wont take too long 
well then have opportunities to do other things possibly 
q general is inaudible still going on at this point in 
the country 
gen kelly right now i just checked before we walked over 
here and not very much as i said in the airborne area and 
they got in late a little bit because of the bad weather they 
finished off their job this afternoon were going in late this 
afternoon up to fort cimarron to check on battalion 2000 and found 
they werent even there so in terms of major fighting going on 
right now there is none 
q general what about 
q general what general excuse me when were the two 
questions when were the shermans taken down to panama and the 
other question is the us representatives had contact with some 
of the noriega opposition people before the force went down was 
there any contact with pdf people thought to be sympathetic 
gen kelly to answer your first question first when was the 
shermans taken down some time ago but not a long time ago 
q a month or 
gen kelly maybe about that and the reason i dont give you 
specific data is because i dont remember it but its in that 
ballpark in terms of contacts with anybody he didnt i didnt 
and nobody i know did we had a mission to go down and thats what 
we did 
q well i mean the people in the embassy told the pool this 
morning that they had had contacts with some of the political 
opposition i guess monday 
gen kelly they they may well have but what i was told to do 
was get the 82nd and the rangers and the others ready to go and 
thats what thats what we did 
q general what about reports that noriega may be either in 
nicaragua or cuba or he may have fled the country and what would 
that do to your efforts to capture him 
gen kelly if hes gone to cuba or nicaragua itd obviously 
slow our efforts down a little bit i guess laughter it 
q can you tell me if hes in that hes in panama 
gen kelly we think he is 
adm sheafer we have no reason to believe that hes outside of 
panama 
gen kelly if noriegas left panama by the way hes utterly 
without influence you know former dictators are not the same as 
elder statesmen hes liable to sit on some beach until somebody 
stops by to say hello to him laughter 
q general are the apaches normally based in panama 
q inaudible tactical air command 
gen kelly sir 
q are the the apaches normally based in panama and could you 
describe how the other helicopters were brought down 
gen kelly well the apaches are not normally based in panama 
and the helicopters were all brought down in larger airplanes 
generally c5s 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO> AP891220-0231 </DOCNO>
<TEXT>
q when did that happen 
gen kelly the apaches went down oh two weeks ago 
q general 
q and how were the other aircraft shot down 
gen kelly which other aircraft 
q inaudible 
gen kelly groundfire mostly groundfire in one case one hit 
a wire i think the other three were groundfire werent they 
q small arms 
gen kelly pretty much yeah 
q small arms rockets 
adm sheafer small arms to the best of our knowledge 
q general you said at the beginning that you did not find any 
evidence that any attack was being planned on the canal had you 
expected to find some 
gen kelly we had to be prepared for that you know the canal 
is one of the major reasons that were in panama the treaty gives 
us the right to protect and defend the canal so thats a duty that 
we have incidentally all of my bosses understand clearly that 
were going to adhere meticulously to the provisions of that 
treaty and thats part of the basis that we went down so yeah we 
were very concerned about it and if you put the panama canal out 
of business for a couple of years that would represent an economic 
difficulty in the military 
q general 
q when will the reinforcements arrive 
gen kelly which reinforcements 
q the 2500 youre sending down of military police 
gen kelly the 7th infantry division should be completed 
sometime tonight the reason i say that is there is fog up at 
travis and when we can get them out is a little bit difficult to 
predict but right now weve got 31 airplanes for them 21 are in 
the air the mps left this morning starting at eight to the tune 
of one airplane per hour so there were 25 airplanes and i sat 
down and figured that out took a little while but about 25 
hours will put them in there sometime and i think well even beat 
that so say 715 tomorrow morning 
q general have you heard anything about costa rica offering 
sanctuary to noriega if he crosses over and lays down his arms 
gen kelly i have not 
q general did you have difficulty getting control of the radio 
station that was continually broadcasting for noriega 
gen kelly we didnt have difficulty getting control of it 
because we werent trying to get control of it we had difficulty 
getting it off the air we are still working on that and we expect 
to be successful very shortly 
q how are you doing that can you describe that 
gen kelly i cant tell you how we plan to do it but we plan 
to do it 
q could you give us a little better breakdown on the 
casualties we heard earlier firefights at the comandancia was it 
also at rio hato 
gen kelly firefights went on here at rio hato we sent our 
troops in wellarmed and superbly trained and i know that sounds 
like bragging but thats just the truth they were so theyre at 
an advantage with almost anybody else anywhere and the rangers of 
course went in at rio hato they had tacair assisting them right 
before they went in there wasnt 
q what kind of tacair 
gen kelly im not going to say but we had tacair there the 
marines didnt have major enemy forces in their area their vital 
and key job was to keep the bridge of the americas open which of 
course is the lifeline in panama the fighting up here in the 
airborne area turned out to be stiff in places but overall not all 
that difficult witness battalion 2000 not putting up much of a 
fight i dont think we had too much trouble down here with the 
cavalry squadron the panama vieja 
the fighting around the comandancia initially was probably as 
stiff as any that we ran into but when we finally went into it 
this afternoon it had been unoccupied they had left i think one 
of the reasons that the casualties were as low as they were was 
that we we had welltrained soldiers we had the helicopter 
gunships we had the ac130s which is an airforce gunship which is 
extremely accurate and we took advantage of the tools that we had 
in order to protect our soldiers and sailors and airmen and 
marines 
mr williams ladies and gentlemen thank you very much we need 
to get we need to get general kelly back to the command post let 
me just make two notes here first of all about your question about 
contacts with people obviously there were contacts with the people 
that have now been now taken over as the duly elected leaders of 
panama they were clearly contacted before the operation and said 
they supported it as secretary cheney and i think general powell 
said this morning they already answered the question about contact

obscurity 
a group of american relatives in lockerbie for the anniversary 
presented a memorial plaque to councilman hugh young at the town

there were times when we lost our faith in fellow man said 
joe horgan of philadelphia a board member of the victims of pan am

was devastated itself these people reached out in the midst of our 
own devastation and guided us said horgan whose brotherinlaw 
was on the flight 
another plaque made of three slabs of gray finnish granite 
inscribed with all 270 victims named will be dedicated thursday at

fly them to the services the airline is not sending an official 
representative to lockerbie but some employees were expected to

heads the group said some relatives planned to attend a public 
memorial service in washington on thursday while others would go 
into seclusion

that particular day he said in a british television documentary

jibril has denied involvement but acknowledged his group has 
used devices similar to the plastic explosives concealed in a 
radiocassette player that blew the jumbo jet apart

the us invasion of panama on wednesday 
upset the 12yearold pen pal to panamas deposed gen manuel 
noriega 
im really disappointed about what our two governments are 
doing and i feel for the safety of panamanian and united states 
soldiers sarah york said in an interview with marquette 
television station wluc 
the schoolgirl said she was worried about the safety of noriega 
who went into hiding when us troops attacked 
i hope that hes doing ok and nothing bad will happen to 
him she said hes very nice and intelligent and seems like 
the kind of person someone can trust he never let me down and i 
feel like i can trust him 
sarah struck up a correspondence with noriega following his 1988 
indictment on us drug charges she has visited the dictator 
twice first as his guest last year then in october on her own 
her parents criticized for allowing the visits condemned the 
invasion 
we are a family among the american people who support the 
panamanians in their struggle for selfdetermination and 
sovereignty pauline york said in a recorded telephone message at

the president and his military to end this invasion to the 
panamanian people todo por la patria which means all for the 
motherland the recording said 
sarahs father prison guard mitchell york questioned us 
motives for the invasion 
do you think its worth american lives to go after one man 
he asked do you think its worth alienating the entire 
hemisphere against us for political vanity 
during sarahs last visit nine days after the october coup 
attempt noriega called sarah a meritorious daughter of panama 
she said then she feared for noriega if he ever was brought to the 
united states 
they probably wont even listen to him on trial she said 
they will just put him in jail

political pressure since his february 1988 indictment us 
sanctions depressed the economy but did not budge noriega two 
attempts at coups failed

secretary of state gentry crowell who 
shot himself in the head last week as a corruption probe tightened 
around his office died wednesday after doctors declared him 
braindead 
crowell who was not implicated personally in the investigation 
had been in a coma since shooting himself once with a 38caliber 
revolver at his home dec 12 
his condition worsened tuesday night as tests showed a 
restricted blood flow to the brain final tests showed little blood 
flow and doctors decided wednesday to remove him from lifesupport 
systems said dr joseph c ross an associate vice chancellor at 
vanderbilt university medical center 
he essentially was found to have no brain function ross 
said it was comparable to an extensive or massive stroke 
crowell 57 never regained consciousness after the shooting he 
had remained in critical condition and was treated with intravenous 
injections of a drug designed to remove fluids from the brain and 
reduce swelling 
gov ned mcwherter issued a statement of condolence to crowells 
family who were at the hospital when he died at 119 pm 
this is a sad and unfortunate time for his wife terrijean 
and their children melissa chris and brooks mcwherter said 
james w simmons was appointed by mcwherter on tuesday to fill 
crowells role until the jan 9 convening of the legislature which 
can appoint a successor 
controversy much of it growing out of his passionate devotion 
to the democratic party followed crowell during most of his 18 
years in state government 
he was once known as the godfather on capitol hill because 
of his absolute partisan control over legislation in the dual 
roles of chairman of the house democratic caucus and the house 
calendar committee 
as secretary of state he was in charge of regulating bingo and 
spending by lobbyists and political campaigns all of which were 
involved in the federalstate investigation into public corruption 
he testified in september and november 1989 before federal grand 
juries in nashville and memphis investigating bingo corruption in 
tennessee he said he was told by federal agents that he was not a 
target of the investigation 
as a result of the probe one former crowell aide former chief 
bingo inspector wd donnie walker has gone to federal prison 
in alabama his longtime aide mary sue wright has been named an 
unindicted coconspirator and given immunity from prosecution 
ms wright kept the books on a campaign fund started by crowell 
and two other constitutional officers on behalf of democratic 
candidates for the legislature she admitted taking thousands of 
dollars from the fund and a federal grand jury in memphis has 
subpoenaed records from it 
the secretary of states office had regulated charitable bingo 
since it was legalized for charity fundraising in 1971 it did not 
become controversial however until 1979 when the legislature 
outlawed bingo on the final day of the session 
after protracted negotiations between the house and senate the 
game was made legal again in 1980 and the office of charitable 
solicitations was put in charge every year thereafter the 
legislature amended the bingo law in an effort to weed out 
professional gambling 
in october 1987 crowell revoked the bingo license for a 
kingsport amvets post on grounds the group gave little of its 
profits to charity the case was appealed up to the state supreme 
court which ruled bingo an unconstitutional lottery in february 
1989

only a few blips registered on financial markets wednesday as 
investors took the us invasion of panama in stride 
the dollar oil and many stocks moved higher on the news of the 
surprise us military operation but prices later receded amid the 
usual concerns about interest rates and the economy 
the initial reaction is one of a nonevent said dennis e 
jarrett a stock analyst with kidder peabody amp co in new york 
it might have an impact if it becomes a prolonged situation 
president bush ordered troops into panama following several days 
of tension triggered by the weekend shooting death of a us 
military officer by defense forces controlled by gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average a key 
barometer of financial reaction to outside events closed down 768 
points to the 268793 following an initial rise stocks advancing 
in price narrowly outnumbered declining issues on the new york 
stock exchange 
analysts said the panama confrontations economic effects were 
unclear but investors remain worried about the health of the us 
economy in general 
most experts did not view the panamanian situation as a reason 
for making big changes in their investment strategies 
weve been involved in limited engagements before this looks 
like a military engagement that will be over shortly said larry 
wachtel a vice president for prudentialbache securities inc in 
new york 
some analysts said they looked upon the assault as generally 
positive because it showed the bush administration meant business 
i think people are encouraged by the forceful action by our 
government said michael metz a technical analyst with new 
yorkbased oppenheimer amp co but theres a lot of anxieties on 
wall steet worries about the real estate market and a looming 
recession 
in another sign that the economy was dominating investor 
thinking some us treasury bond prices moved slightly higher in 
late new york trading after the federal reserve signaled it might 
lower interest rates the prospect of lower rates on government 
issues often spurs demand for existing bonds pushing prices higher 
speculation about lower rates also helped depress the dollar in 
foreign exchange trading 
the us currency initially rallied on the news of the panama 
action because in times of international tension investors buy 
dollars and precious metals as safe havens for their money 
the dollar closed sharply higher in tokyo but was mixed in 
europe and new york 
gabriele schmitt a trader with the bank of new york said the 
dollar still had room to rise because of the uncertainty in panama 
there are still a lot of question marks she said noriega 
still has a lot of support in his country i wouldnt rule him 
out entirely 
gold prices were not affected significantly by the panama news 
but managed to finish slightly higher in new york trading 
the oil futures market initially rallied but prices fell back 
later in the day 
on the new york mercantile exchange the february contract for 
west texas intermediate the leading grade of us crude oil was 
down 7 cents to settle at 2121 per 42gallon barrel 
the january home heating oil contract supported in recent days 
from a cold spell that hit parts of the nation was up 075 cent to 
settle at 7576 cents a gallon 
i think the reaction to the panama closure was totally 
irrational bob baker an energy analyst with prudentialbache 
said of the early rally 
prices jumped over concern that the closing of the panama canal 
might disrupt oil shipments but as most analysts noted only a 
small percentage of crude shipped to the united states passes 
through the panama canal

the panama canal a crowning 
achievement of us industry and energy has been a boon for world 
trade a symbol of achievement for americans and a source of dismay 
for many panamanians 
the canal has been good and bad for us said historian 
carlos bolivar pedreschi in an interview with the associated press 
earlier this year 
it helped us attain independence and created an efficient 
class of administrators but then the united states also created 
and supported a panamanian military class that claiming it must 
prepare to protect the canal has suppressed the democratic 
forces pedreschi said 
the canal was closed for the first time in many years on 
wednesday after the beginning of the us attack that ousted the 
most recent representative of that military class gen manuel 
antonio noriega 
it had been closed before but only because of landslides in the 
narrow gaillaird cut the canal commission headquartered at balboa 
heights above the southern end of the canal hoped to have the 
canal open for business on thursday but it wasnt clear if it 
would be safe 
the united states helped panama secede from colombia in 1903 
with president theodore roosevelt serving as godfather and paid 
the french who started work on the canal 40 million for rights 
and properties then spent 387 million and ten years building it 
linking the atlantic and pacific oceans and cutting sailing time 
around cape horn by more than half the waterway was a marvel of 
engineering from the start nearly 262 million cubic yards of dirt 
and rock were removed enough to fill a train circling earth four 
times 
since then dredges have dug out nearly 400 million more cubic 
yards to widen it and keep the 51milelong waterway in running 
condition 
an estimated 36000 workers were employed at the peak of the 
enterprise and they built dams and locks conquered yellow fever 
and malaria and sawed through gold hill now the peak of culebra 
cut also known as the gailliard cut for its chief engineer 
in order to negotiate the waterway ships are lifted 85 feet 
from one ocean and deposited again in the other through the locks 
whose level rises or descads depending on the ships direction 
the cuts the route from for example peru to the east coast by 
6200 miles and the cost is not exhorbitant 183 per cargo ton 
in 1989 146 per ton unloaded adventurer richard halliburton 
weighing 140 pounds paid 36 cents to swim it in the 1920s 
but adventure and commerce were not the only meaning of the 
canal it had quite another meaning to men like noriegas mentor 
the late dictator omar torrijos who made it their historic project 
to recover the canal zone 
the zone was an affluent little america 10 miles on each side 
of the waterway replete with manicured lawns its own courts 
police stamps stores and lifestyle 
the treaty that created the zone a 10mile wide domain of us 
sovereignty that cut panama in two was considered unfair even by 
john hay the us secretary of state who arranged it but it 
helped convince congress to spend the money to build the canal 
over the years highly paid american canal employees and 
military personnel living caused increasing resentment among poorly 
paid panamanians especially blacks who faced southernstyle 
segregation 
in 1964 riots over what flags should fly at balboa high school 
left four us soldiers and 22 panamanians dead 
the panama canal treaties signed in 1977 by president jimmy 
carter and torrijos eliminated the canal zone and called for the 
united states to give up all rights to the canal it built and 
maintained at noon on dec 31 1999 
when torrijos died in a plane accident in 1981 an obscure 
military intelligence officer whom he had befriended began to work 
himself up the ladder of power in 1983 he became head of the 
defense forces 
the treaty the canal and compliance became one of many bones of 
contention between the united states and panama during noriegas 
stint as leader of panama

washington am the soviet union is supporting democracy by 
not interfering in other countries while the united states this 
time is supporting democracy by sending troops into another 
country secretary of state james a baker iii noted wednesday 
in discussing the soviet criticism of the us attack on the 
forces of dictator gen manuel antonio noriega baker said 
let me say that i think both the united states and the soviet 
union today are supporting democracy at least thats what 
president gorbachev told president bush at malta when he said he 
had a little problem with the use of the word democratic i mean 
western values so we agreed that we would you use the term 
democratic values 
the difference is that the soviet union supports democracy by 
staying out of countries and thus permitting democracy to proceed 
in this one and very unique instance the united states did it by 
going in to assist a democratically elected government against a 
dictator 
there have been many reports from eastern europe crediting 
gorbachevs refusal to support local communist parties for the 
dramatic emergence of noncommunist governments in several capitals 
noriega overturned the results of an election this year in which 
panama citizens voted for guillermo endara for president on may 7

some americans called it necessary a professor in california 
said it was an overreaction and a panamanian dissident in 
pennsylvania said us military intervention in his homeland 
wednesday was a profound error 
in new york city about 200 people marched through midtown to 
protest the invasion chanting us out of panama and other 
slogans they were jeered by numerous passersby 
get out of here banker jay smith shouted at the protesters 
youre wrong 
about 200 protesters marched in downtown seattle and about 100 
gathered in freezing temperatures in boston 
panama is a sister caribbean country that has outrageous 
conditions of poverty military solutions bring nothing dessima 
williams a former ambassador to the organization of american 
states from grenada and a fellowship student at radcliffe college 
said at the boston rally 
you need a revolution here in the us she said to cheers 
from the crowdyou need a revolution in foreign policy 
while americans and others had mixed opinions about president 
bushs decision to use us troops in panama they expressed little 
support for panama leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
if i had a christmas wish itd be that dictators like that all 
die said karen romano a 26yearold sales assistant in chicago 
what were doing here is getting rid of a hooligan that is 
causing great turmoil in our hemisphere said jose garcia de 
lara national president of san antoniobased league of united 
latin american citizens which claims 12500 members nationwide 
i think its a good move manuel noriega is an international 
criminal and should be brought to justice said bernie morgan 
62 civil court manager in rochester ny 
i dont always agree with an eye for an eye but how much can 
you take said daniel epps 35 of randallstown md referring 
to the death of a us marine lieutenant in panama on saturday 
its not a war on panama its a war on drugs robert mauro 
a street vendor in new york city said in reference to drug charges 
against noriega in the united states the drugs are undermining 
our country 
criticism centered on the invasion early wednesday by american 
troops in search of noriega 
this was a profound error as a panamanian and an professor of 
international law i cant agree with the action the us has 
taken said miguel antonio bernal a fulbright professor at 
lehigh university in pennsylvania and editor of the panamanian 
opposition newspaper alternativa 
the us intervenes with thousands of people just to arrest 
one guy this isnt going to help in the long term of our 
relationship he said 
terry karl an assistant professor of political science at 
stanford university in california and latin american specialist 
said he thought the attack was an overreaction 
it is particularly unfortunate of the united states to rely on 
force to resolve issues at a time when the soviet union has 
renounced the use of force against countries on its borders karl 
said 
thomas w walker director of ohio universitys latin america 
studies program said latin america should solve its own problems 
we just like the soviets have to learn to be more relaxed in 
dealing with the countries that are essentially under our wing 
walker said in a statement 
the executive secretary of the quakers american friends service 
committee in philadelphia condemned the military action 
shorn of rhetoric this is another case of the us imposing 
its will on another country through direct military intervention a 
clear violation of international law said asia a bennett 
brian becker who helped organize the new york protest said the 
invasion violated the constitution only congress can declare 
war becker said 
another protester sharon ayling said the invasion was an 
attempt to regain control of the panama canal the united states 
has agreed to turn the canal over to panama by the year 2000 
condemnation also came from the family of sarah york a 
12yearold michigan girl who struck up a correspondence with 
noriega following his 1988 indictment on us drug charges and 
twice has visited the dictator 
the telephone at the familys home in the upper peninsula 
community of negaunee was answered by a recorded message from 
sarahs mother pauline york we join the people and the nations 
of the world in calling on the president and his military to end 
this invasion to the panamanian people todo por la patria 
which means all for the motherland 
others expressed reservations 
personally i dont think its a great idea the ussr 
isnt that happy about it and things were going good with them 
prior to this said kari schumann 23 a sales assistant from 
henrietta ny 
but support came from bushs predecessor and former public 
officials 
president bushs decision to use us military personnel to 
protect the lives of american citizens in panama and to restore 
democracy there was correct and deserves our full support former 
president reagan said in a statement issued from his office in los 
angeles 
he said the administration has tried to reach a negotiated 
settlement to the problems in panama but noriega rejected all 
diplomatic efforts 
there comes a time when a president must take action that 
time has come i join all americans in the hope that the people of 
panama will soon know the freedoms to which they are entitled and 
that those who have so abused their power there will be brought to 
justice reagan said 
former sen howard baker who was senate minority leader when 
the panama canal treaty was ratified in 1977 said the assault was 
the only logical response to the situation 
ambler moss jr former us ambassador to panama who negotiated 
the panama canal treaty said public criticism from democratically 
elected latin america leaders is likely 
what latin american leaders will say publicly and what they 
think privately are two different things but they frankly are very 
happy to see noriega fall moss said in coral gables fla 
we should have done it a long time ago said arnold hunter 
a greenville tenn retiree who served in world war ii and the 
korean war im sorry im too old to go i dont feel lives 
are lost when its for a good cause 
robert wesson hoover institution scholar and author of a series 
of books on latin america said the intervention could be a big 
plus for bushs popularity in the united states 
as long as the government is acting on behalf of democratic 
institutions getting rid of a pretty terrible dictator putting in 
power people who were elected and not putting claims on the 
country or the canal i dont think there will be serious 
criticism he said from hoover a think tank on the stanford 
campus

regular panamanian defense forces from their bases on wednesday and 
planned to begin clearing the streets of panama city on thursday of 
troops loyal to their fugitive leader gen manuel antonio noriega 
top pentagon officials said 
it looks like the organized resistance is a thing of the 
past said lt gen tom kelly the director of operations for the 
pentagons joint staff 
us troops reported seeing noriega several times on tuesday 
but on wednesday he and an undetermined number of loyal troops 
eluded capture kelly told a pentagon briefing

we have a concern that they have gone off into the jungle 
he told reporters there is every chance that we will go off 
after them 
the main operation on thursday will be moving military police 
and other units into panama city a city of 1 million where nine of 
noriegas 18 socalled dignity battalions were spotted wednesday 
said rear adm ted shaefer an intelligence specialist 
the dignity battalions which beat civilian candidates during 
elections last spring are poorly armed and organized and are not 
considered a major military threat said shaefer 
us officials expect ship traffic to resume thursday through 
the panama canal said kelly 
the canal is functioning there has been no endeavor that we 
have discovered to destroy it he said 
the more than 20000 american troops sent against panamanian 
military bases wednesday moved in relative secrecy and carried out 
simultaneous predawn attacks using paratroopers infantry and 
light tank units top pentagon officials say 
it is among the most professionally executed operations that i 
have seen in 33 years of military status kelly told a pentagon 
briefing but he said without elaborating that we have 
information that human beings in panama have made mistakes 
the identities of the dead and wounded had not been released by

base in san antonio texas 
the us forces failed initially to capture their prime target 
noriega hours after the 1 am invasion american troops continued 
to encounter sniper fire and pockets of resistance said defense 
secretary dick cheney 
nevertheless gen colin powell the chairman of the joint 
chiefs of staff proclaimed operation just cause a success 
this reign of terror is over he proclaimed 
powell in a breakfasthour briefing said noriega was not 
running anything because we own all of the bases he owned eight 
hours ago 
the us operations involving ranger paratroopers marine corps 
and army infantrymen and light tanks were launched simultaneously 
against panamanian military bases and noriegas heaquarters the 
commandencia 
i hope you recognize how complicated an operation this was 
and how competently it was carried out powell said 
in addition to the 13000 us troops stationed in panama the 
united states sent 7000 troops there overnight and was airlifting 
an additional 2500 over the course of the day for a total of 
22500 said powell

193rd infantry brigade reinforced with marine corps units a 
battalion from the 7th infantry division at fort ord calif a

center the madden dam and the gamboa prison where they liberated 
47 panamanian officers taken prisoner after the abortive oct 3

task force semper fidelis made up of marines and a light 
armored infantry company which attacked the area around the bridge

but others escapted he said 
task force bayonet made up of the 6th mechanized battalion 
light tanks and the 5th battalion of the 87th infantry which 
attacked noriegas headquarters the scene of the heaviest fighting 
asked whether noriega might form a guerrilla army powell said 
he can do that and we will chase him and we will find him he 
is a very canny individual hes demonstrated incredible ability to 
survive catastrophe and well see over time whether he survives 
this catastrophe 
its been some years since general mister noriega the 
fugitive has been seen in the jungle hes used to a different 
kind of lifestyle im not quite sure he would be up to being 
chased around the countryside by army rangers special forces and

us allies in latin america condemned the use 
of force by the united states in speeches wednesday before the 
organization of american states but bogged down in haggling over 
procedures to vote on a resolution 
many of the members spoke out against the us attacks in panama 
but they held fast to a rule requiring resolutions be submitted 24 
hours before a vote can take place they agreed to meet again 
thursday 
the resolution was suggested by panamanian ambassador jose maria 
cabrera a supporter of gen manuel antonio noreiga and was 
introduced by nicaragua cabrera called on the oas to condemn the 
brutal and criminal aggression against his country by the 
united states 
the united states asked members to rally around the decision 
to send american troops into panama 
we hope you will understand and support our action said 
us representative luigi einaudi 
in a separate action the mexican government condemned the us 
invasion although it also denounced noriega 
the fight against international crime is not sufficient reason 
to intervene in a sovereign nation the mexican government said 
in a statement issued through its embassy in washington in 
mexicos opinion dialogue and negotiation continue to offer the 
best alternative in finding a peaceful solution to the situation 
among the usual allies condemning the use of force at the oas 
meeting were brazil chile peru haiti uruguay and costa rica 
before the meeting began the members met behind closed doors to 
discuss a letter sent by panamas newly swornin president 
guillermo endara asking that the oas recognize lawrence chewning 
fabrega as his designated representative the letter was telefaxed 
from the us southern command 
the oas members decided to recognize cabrera they did not 
consider the issue of whether they recognized endara and his 
government 
the forces of the united states continue bombing cabrera 
told the oas ministers at an emergency session called by panama to 
denounce the us invasion in his country 
under no circumstances will we accept some supposed leaders 
who are puppets imposed by the united states he said referring 
to endaras government which is recognized by the bush 
administration 
the resolution before the oas asked members to condemn the use 
of force and demand a withdrawal of the troops 
one of the ambassadors who spoke on condition of anonymity 
said shortly before the meeting began that the oas has to condemn 
this act no matter how bad noriega is we cant condone violence 
president bush said wednesday that he ordered troops into panama 
to save american lives and bring noriega to the united states to be 
tried on drug trafficking charges 
bush said the united states would withdraw its invasion force as 
soon as possible 
the united states is very pleased that the outlaw regime 
manipulated by manuel antonio noriega has given way to a regime 
that reflects the democratic will of the people einaudi told oas 
members noriega increasingly acted in an unstable unpredictable 
and dangerous manner 
the nicaraguan representative victoria castillo sided with 
panama 
it is an aberration to speak of democracy and carry out 
aggression she said

a year into his vice presidency dan quayle is 
making the most of any favorable publicity that comes his way his 
wry smile an acknowledgement that it has been scarce there is no 
comparable shortage of advice he gets that all the time 
hes been told to raise his profile and to lower it to be more 
relaxed and to be more guarded against gaffes he has been advised 
to specialize on a few chosen trademark issues and to be a 
generalist so as to display a grasp on the whole catalogue of 
issues through it all quayle has one set answer he works for 
president bush and he will keep doing what the boss wants done 
his assignment in 1990 will include a heavy political campaign 
schedule a traditional vice presidential role in offyear 
elections for quayle that job could be a way to overcome old image 
problems and prove that hes not out of his depth perceptions that 
haunt him in the public opinion surveys 
vice presidents tend to be underemployed as nelson a 
rockefeller said in shunning the post he later filled they are 
standby equipment they usually get specialized assignments 
quayles include space issues and efforts to enhance us 
competitiveness in world markets but other officials have primary 
daytoday responsibility its always difficult for the no 2 man 
to put his own imprint on government actions or decisions as 
ronald reagans vice president bush headed a task force on 
regulatory reform a popular topic in the deregulation decade it 
looked like a promising role but not much happened 
thats not uncommon for understudies 
a vice president is a dependent his official standing depends 
entirely on the boss bush has helped on that score 
quayle sees bush every morning when both are in town and says 
he has full access to the president this has been a very 
comfortable important relationship that we have worked out in 
these early morning sessions quayle said this week in a cspan 
television interview 
that welladvertised access provides a sort of power 
when im on capitol hill senators congressmen say would 
you please give this to the president or tell the president 
this or i dont like this particular policy i want you to do 
something about it quayle said in the tv interview 
bush has publicly promised quayle renomination for a second term 
as vice president and top republicans consider the commitment to be 
absolute 
but neither job security nor presidential praise has done much 
for the performance ratings despite what quayle considers a good 
first year in office so he relished a dec 15 wall street journal 
column praising his performance 
after 12 months in this job i will take any favorable 
publicity i can possibly obtain and i will pocket it he said 
and i think ill take that editorial and make sure that its 
reprinted and perhaps sent out to some of my friends 
republican party leaders say that quayle can raise both his 
profile and his standing in 1990 in the offyear campaign role that 
has become traditional for vice presidents he already gets good 
ratings for his work for party candidates and causes the party 
counts about 7 million in proceeds from gop fundraising events 
featuring quayle 
bush will be out campaigning for chosen republican candidates 
next year as he has at fundraising events for two gop senate 
challengers but the heavy schedule of sustained campaigning is 
assigned to the vice president it was bushs role in the two 
offyear elections of his vice presidency and it will be quayles 
in 1990 
hell have help in january e spencer abraham the michigan 
republican chairman will become his deputy chief of staff 
concentrating on political liaison and supervising speech writing 
travel planning and the like 
the vice president says hed like to spend more time outside the 
washington beltway in the real america hell have ample 
opportunity in the coming campaign in a role that can help him 
shape a new image or cement the old one 
quayle said his sometimes shaky performance in the 1988 campaign 
was due in part to traveling consultants who overcoached him to 
the point of stifling him in 1990 he can do it his way

when producer woody fraser created abcs 
home show two years ago to help people live their lives he 
didnt know it was going to get so personal 
what the show is really about is to give people ideas and help 
them make decisions said fraser 
the morning show offers practical suggestions on health 
cooking home buying and remodeling automobiles and arts it has a 
number of regular experts including one who reviews movies and 
videos from the standpoint of families with small children 
home marks its 500th show on thursday and celebrates its second 
anniversary on jan 18 
but for fraser who established abcs good morning america 
the mike douglas show thats incredible and many other 
shows it got very personal seven months ago 
fraser 55 suffered a heart attack and underwent bypass 
surgery since then hes lost 47 pounds by changing his eating 
habits and exercising 
i cut out fats and dairy products from my diet and took up 
exercise he said i went from being a sedentary individual to 
a person whos active again i get more sleep i do yoga i found 
that doctors dont know anything about diet i read all the books 
that people sent me when i had my heart attack i picked out the 
things that worked for me 
he put his personal experiences on the air and made a rare 
appearance as a guest last july after he returned to work he 
devoted a week to a series called heart and soul the show was 
devoted to a study that showed yoga meditation and positive 
affirmation are helpful in preventing and recovering from heart 
attacks 
home also undergoes a change next tuesday gary collins 
takes over as host replacing robb weller collins has been host of 
the miss america pageant for the past five years and was the 
emmywinning host of hour magazine 
fraser said hes wanted to do home ever since he founded 
good morning america in 1975 
i wanted a show that would go later in the morning he said 
its purpose is to give women information that they can apply to 
their lives the key word here is information i said to abc give 
me 60 minutes and ill give you 30 ideas youve never heard of 
its a hard show to promote because we offer help for the home 
recently in the tv listings oprah had a show about women who 
had shot their husbands and still loved them geraldo had satanic 
babies donahue had crossdressing and we had a show about 
barbecuing 
we dont have a great come on but the people who watch our 
show come back thats why gary collins is taking over i want to 
add his marquee value to the show i think hell bring us viewers 
of all network shows on daytime television home has the 
largest audience among women 1834 fraser said home also puts 
out a newsletter that goes to two million subscribers 
a show on poisons in the home got 44000 responses to a 900 
number for 2 viewers got a newsletter information on poisons and 
6 in coupons the sponsor had expected only about 5000 responses 
since it began the show has expanded to an hour from 30 minutes 
and has gone to live telecast instead of tape the live telecast 
allows the show to have satellite remotes and to take instant polls 
home has also taken its name to heart and has purchased 
three houses and is about to purchase a fourth 
we take the viewer through every step of the purchase and 
financing said fraser then we go in and remodel and 
redecorate the house we started with a house that cost about 
160000 then we sold it and bought a house for 240000 each 
time we apply the profit to buying a more expensive house the last 
house we bought for 300000 but we havent been able to sell it 
because of the poor real estate market 
the last house is a duplex people had asked us to do 
something on apartments each side of the house is like an 
apartment so we were able to show people things to do with smaller 
space

federal engineers have upgraded an 
investigation of a possible steering deficiency in the 1988 
chevrolet beretta the government said 
the national highway traffic safety administration also said 
tuesday it was investigating reports of exploding heating systems 
in coachmen industries recreational vehicles and of cruise control 
failures in the ford taurus and its twin the mercury sable 
the agency said it was stepping up its beretta probe from a 
preliminary evaluation which involves mostly paperwork to an 
engineering analysis in which the possibly defective parts are 
examined 
such investigations can lead to recalls or can be dismissed if 
engineers decide there is no widespread safety problem 
there have been 39 complaints of loss of steering control in the 
1988 beretta agency spokesman tim hurd said twentyone accidents 
and 10 injuries have been blamed on the problem an estimated 
259000 of the vehicles are on the road 
the chevrolet corsica is similar to the beretta but the agency 
did not mention any steering problems with the corsica 
general motors corp spokesman tom pyden said the company would 
continue cooperating with the agency in its investigation 
an engineering analysis doesnt necessarily mean theres a 
defect with the vehicle pyden said 
the agency has begun a preliminary evaluation of coachmen 
industries recreational vehicles manufactured between 1981 and 
1985 there have been four reports of explosions in the vehicles 
furnaces which burn liquified petroleum gas hurd said no 
injuries or accidents have been reported 
an estimated 40000 of the vehicles were manufactured in the 
fiveyear period he said 
a spokeswoman for coachmen industries based in elkhart ind 
said she was not familiar with the report and could not comment 
the agency also launched a preliminary evaluation of the ford 
taurus and mercury sable manufactured between 1986 and 1988 there 
have been 15 reports of cruise controls failing to disengage hurd 
said no accidents or injuries have been reported 
the investigation covers an estimated 125 million vehicles 
ford spokeswoman joy stinson said 
a preliminary evalution was begun of reported fuel tank 
corrosion in large general motors pickup trucks manufactured 
between 1984 and 1988 there have been four complaints an 
estimated 17 million vehicles are on the road 
the agency also discontinued several investigations finding no 
evidence of a widespread problem among them

importers of grand marnier liqueur say the 
failure of about 10 percent of the 200000 motorized holiday 
advertisements they placed in the new yorker magazine earlier this 
month doesnt discourage them 
michel roux president of carillon importers ltd of teaneck 
nj called the failure rate normal when introducing new 
technology and said he remained committed to trying new 
approaches to magazine ads 
he estimated there have been about 500 complaints from readers 
who were disappointed that the highlytouted ad didnt work as they 
thought it should 
the ad shows two birds with opposite ends of a ribbon in their 
beaks the ribbon is draped around a liqueur bottle and as the 
birds alternately appear to fly higher the bottle beneath them 
swings as if it were a bell 
roux said monday in a telephone interview that reader surveys 
indicated 10 percent of the ads failed to operate as intended and 
that the company was distributing replacements to those who ask for 
them 
its not a serious problem we have mailed out 500 or so ads 
to people who said their ad didnt work he said 
he said the technology which made use of a battery and wire 
embedded beneath the pieces of cardboard used for the ad was 
sensitive and some systems were likely to get crushed in the 
binding and mailing processes 
some of the ads sent back were in working condition but the 
readers apparently didnt wait long enough for the motorized action 
to begin roux said he said a few people complained that the bell 
didnt ring but the ad was not designed to emit any sound and 
other ads simply didnt work 
from rouxs perspective getting a complaint isnt the worst 
thing that could happen it shows they were interested by the 
ad he said 
carillon spent about 750000 on producing and placing the ad in 
200000 issues of the dec 11 edition of the new yorker that were 
sent to subscribers in california and new york state 
the company has tried to make use of advances in technology for 
other magazine ads in the past including singing and talking 
microchips for another of its products absolut vodka 
steven florio president of the new yorker said the magazine 
got about a dozen calls about grand marnier ads that failed to 
move 
but he said he welcomed the attention that rouxs ads bring to 
the magazine we hope he does something as innovative next 
year florio said

the soft new england real estate market has made 
wall street jumpy in recent days but analysts say the slowdown has 
been coming for a long time and isnt likely to disappear soon 
the nervousness began friday when bank of new england corp 
announced it expected to report a substantial loss for the year 
because it had to boost reserves to cover bad real estate loans 
the bank the nations 15th largest also said it might rescind 
a stock dividend and would consider possible mergers and sales of 
assets 
the weekend seemed only to increase worries and on monday the 
stock market took its sharpest drop in five weeks with the dow 
jones industrial average falling 4202 points to 269753 
although the market stabilized tuesday brokers said investors 
remained uneasy about the outlook for real estate finance and 
regional banks 
its probably too early to say recession said mark lynch 
a banking industry analyst with bear stearns amp co but some of 
the banks are going to be disasters the fears in the market arent 
groundless 
the question on many minds was whether a regional real estate 
slump could precipitate a fullscale nationwide recession so far 
averted after seven years of economic growth 
economic factors feed on each other and its hard to say 
whether this leads to other declines said mas kakutani a 
director of bank analysts for moodys investors service inc a 
creditrating agency but along with real estate were seeing 
slowdowns in manufacturing and the service industries 
one real estate group said tuesday that talk of regional real 
estate problems having national economic implications was overblown 
many of these doom and gloom analyses are authored on the 
eastern seaboard where median home prices in some cities have 
declined over the past year said norman d flynn president of 
the national association of realtors at any given time some 
housing markets are hot some are not 
analysts said the real estate problem began when zealous 
regional banks courted too many deals during the construction boom 
of the mid1980s 
there was too much money chasing too few good deals said 
george fantini senior vice president of the boston financial 
group a real estate service company there was a lot of money in 
the hands of some inexperienced lending officers people who had 
made only 100000 loans were suddenly making 5 million loans 
the big money fueled competition and a herd mentality 
everyone got bullish on new england fantini said it was 
viewed as a wonderful market few people thought it would end 
the building continued but buying stopped the states 
hightech industry the juggernaut behind much of the 
massachusetts miracle sputtered today office buildings that 
computer firms thought they could fill lie empty along route 128 
west of boston 
kakutani of moodys said real estates dire straits could be 
traced back at least 18 to 20 months but banks are just starting 
to take it seriously he said 
theres no question the banks were slow to respond kakutani 
said but banks often reflect the perceptions of the market 
three months ago most banks would have said this was part of a 
periodic boomandbust cycle theyre not saying that anymore 
the only immediate solution for banks lynch said is to keep 
bad loans to a minimum and to cut costs layoffs in other words 
fantini admitted the situation was bad but said federal 
regulators were making it worse by forcing lending institutions to 
liquidate their real estate assets too quickly 
regulators say to banks sell your real estate assets i 
say to who fantini said theres no capital out there for 
liquidation 
to dig themselves out of their financial quagmire fantini 
suggested banks offer incentives like lowinterest mortgages to 
firsttime home buyers 
the only bright spot in new englands real estate market may be 
cheaper homes for some buyers optimists hope declining interest 
rates will support the real estate market via lower mortgage rates 
for buyers and refinancings at lower costs for some existing 
homeowners 
this will provide opportunities to buy condominiums or 
houses kakutani said it will make home buying a more viable 
option for some 
and the future in all likelihood housing demand will continue 
dropping if population figures are any indication 
harvard university economist gregory mankiw who has studied 
population trends said in the next decade there wont be many home 
buyers to replace the babyboomers who drove housing prices up in 
the 1970s and early 80s 
were coming into an unprecedented time in terms of low 
population growth mankiw said the 1990s will be a slow time 
for housing

three argentinian nationals have been 
found guilty of trying to extort 10 million from the du pont co 
for the return of stolen documents the company claimed contained 
trade secrets for the production of lycra 
lycra is du ponts trade name for spandex an elastic fiber used 
primarily in clothing such as swimming suits and leotards 
a federal jury deliberated about two hours tuesday before 
returning guilty verdicts for conspiracy and attempted extortion 
against bruno skerianz raul armando giordano and antonio ruben 
inigo 
they each face up to 20 years in prison and a 250000 fine 
us district judge joseph longobardi set sentencing for feb 26 
jose petrosino another defendant is fighting extradition from 
italy charges were dropped against maria i lorenzo de bianchini 
who agreed to testify for the federal government 
during the nineday trial the prosecution portrayed skerianz as 
the mastermind behind the extortion attempt 
the defense however claimed skerianz had not attempted 
extortion because he and the others had planned to manufacture 
spandex for radicci an italian textile manufacturer 
the defense argued that du pont initiated the contact with 
skerianz after mexican textile manufacturer isaac assa told the 
wilmingtonbased chemical giant that skerianz had the documents 
assa was a former employer of skerianz 
the prosecution argued du pont had been induced against its will 
to agree to pay 10 million for 1581 documents concerning lycra 
production that were stolen from its lycra manufacturing plant in 
mercedes argentina 
the prosecution said du pont was forced to enter into an 
agreement with skerianz and the others under the agreement 
skerianz and the others would not work in spandex production for 
five years in addition during that period du pont would agree to 
sell 20 tons of spandex yarn per month to a company chosen by 
skerianz 
the negotiations had been conducted between du pont officials 
and new york attorney marvin gersten who represented skerianz 
among the prosecution witnesses were skerianz two brothers 
both of whom work for du pont one brother ferre scheriase a du 
pont vice president for latin american operations testified that 
during a conversation with skerianz his brother said i am 
willing to talk with anybody in du pont if someone needs to know 
the value of this the documents it is worth 10 million to me 
skerianz had worked for du pont more than 20 years ago while 
the others had resigned from the mercedes plant in the fall of 1988 
the three defendants and lorenzo de bianchini were all arrested 
in february in geneva switzerland after an aborted attempt to 
return the documents and pick up the 10 million 
petrosino was arrested later 
last year du pont had lycra sales of more than 600 million 
the company said it plans to invest more than 1 billion over the 
next four years to expand its lycra capacity according to du pont 
the lycra demand has exceeded the supply 
du pont controls more than 50 percent of the spandex market 
worldwide according to company officials

creation of a north american common market 
consisting of the united states canada and mexico is an idea 
which appeals to a large majority of us residents according to a 
new poll 
the poll released this week was taken for a group of leading 
mexican business executives and an affiliated group in this country 
the groups the mexican council of businessmen and the us 
mexican development corporation say such a common market is needed 
to compete successfully with japan and the european economic 
community 
of the 1200 individuals polled throughout the us 85 
percent favored a north american common market to offset 
anticipated heavy competition when the eec countries drop their 
trade frontiers in 1992 said jeffrey peters president of the 
us mexican development corporation usdc 
francisco del cueto a spokesman for the mexican council of 
businessmen mcb also said 1992 would be a critical year for 
international trade 
his organization which includes owners chairmen and executive 
officers of mexicos top 36 industrial groups has long stressed 
usmexican cooperation 
nino noriega a usdc spokesman said no formal proposals for the 
creation of such a common market had been submitted to government 
officials in the three nations involved 
noriega however said there had been some preliminary talks 
with several us congressmen 
its an evolutionary thing that appears to be inevitable 
noriega said of the elimination of north american trade barriers 
its a matter of common sense 
you have mexico with vast natural resources and a large pool 
of less expensive labor the us with technological expertise and 
a highly developed economy and canada with a small population 
but a strong currency and credit power 
trade barriers have essentially been erased between the us 
and canada noriega said 
and we have proof that the same thing would work between the 
us and mexico through the maquiladora program whereby us 
manufacturers have goods finished in communities across the mexican 
border and reimported into this country 
noriega said some people worry about cheap mexican labor taking 
jobs away from us workers but that that wouldnt be the case if 
cooperation created jobs in mexico 
consider he said the resources in mexico and the 
potential mexican market for luxury goods the us market is 
already saturated with 
people think of the rio grande as being like the berlin wall 
most dont realize that if that wall came down the heavy traffic 
businesswise would be southbound 
the telephone poll taken during november for the mcb and usdc 
employed a sample similar to the us national averages by gender 
age ethnic background educationl level and political philosophy 
noriega said 
not surprisingly the poll found that people of hispanic 
background whether it be mexican puerto rican cuban or from 
another spanishspeaking region took a greater interest in mexican 
affairs than the general us population 
while only one third of the total respondents considered mexico 
a good place for american investment more than 55 percent of the 
hispanic respondents considered it so 
at the same time though 90 percent of the total respondents 
said it was important for the us to help mexico to move ahead 
economically 
the poll however also revealed that many nonhispanic 
americans have little knowledge of mexicos political institutions 
and recent history 
only about a third correctly identified mexico as a democratic 
country said del cueto a greater number almost 40 percent 
in fact believe it to be socialistic while more than 7 percent 
even termed it a communist nation

american businesses operating in panama 
scrambled today to assess the impact of the us military invasion 
closing some offices and checking whether the fighting endangered 
their employees 
the government estimates 35000 americans live in panama many 
of whom work for us corporations 
texaco inc said only that all the companys employees are safe 
thats all were prepared to say its just too preliminary to 
make any other comment he said 
texaco owns a large refinery in the colon area near the panama 
canal the refinery has a capacity to handle 100000 barrels of 
crude each day 
citicorp closed the six branches it operates in panama city 
today were still trying to find out whether anybodys 
affected said spokesman ken campbell 
merrrill lynch amp co one of a number of firms to leave panama 
following us sanctions against the country announced in 1988 
moved its operations to the cayman islands last year 
the panama canal where about 30 ships cross the isthmus daily 
was closed at 1 am because of the fighting according to panama 
canal commission spokesman franklin castrellon 
shipping analysts would not speculate on how long the canal 
could be closed and noted that alternate routes and other forms of 
transportation could help diminish the impact if the canal were 
closed for an extended period of time 
the amount of traffic going through the canal is probably not 
going to cause the economy to collapse said mark degenhart an 
analyst with argus research inc 
goods shipped in containers can be transshipped by railroads 
from the west coast to their east coast destinations he said 
companies with ships en route to the canal are proceeding as 
usual in hopes that the canal will be opened by the time their 
ships arrive

in trying to evaluate a mutual fund as a 
prospective investment for the 1990s anyone might naturally start 
by asking how has it done in the 80s 
steeped as they may be in the old doctrine that past performance 
is no guarantee of future results experienced investors 
nevertheless want to see what a funds managers have demonstrated 
they can accomplish 
tenyear periods furthermore provide a convenient reference 
point for people who are pursuing longterm financial goals any 
fund that can turn in good results over such a protracted span 
presumably has something going for it beyond luck or a fleeting hot 
streak 
conversely experts on the subject say a fund that couldnt 
flourish in the lush financial climate of the 1980s ought to have 
some explaining to do before you entrust your money to it for the 
years ahead 
but with all that some advisers say you can go astray by 
putting too much reliance on longterm past performance in the 
process of picking a fund 
for one thing notes sheldon jacobs publisher of the advisory 
letter the noload fund investor in hastingsonhudson ny if 
you insist on a 10year record these days you are going to 
eliminate a great many possibilities right off the bat 
among the 241 diversified stock funds he follows jacobs says 
more than half didnt start operating until 1980 or later and 
nearly a third have gone into the business since 1985 thats a 
lot of potentially outstanding funds to ignore he observes 
in the mutual fund game many analysts say young upandcomers 
often enjoy a special edge on their older competition 
while they are still small to mediumsized they tend to be lean 
operations that can enhance the results they achieve with a 
relatively small number of welltimed investments 
longestablished popular funds can become encumbered by their own 
sheer size 
in recognition of this problem several of the industrys stars 
closed their doors to new investors for lengthy intervals in the 
80s striving to keep their growth at a manageable pace 
some big funds that have kept on scoring top marks such as the 
eminently successful fidelity magellan fund have been widely 
publicized but industry commentators often cite them as the 
exception that proves the rule 
on top of that jacobs suggests the outstanding years in a 
funds past may have been the work of a manager or managers who 
have since moved on to other endeavors its not uncommon for old 
funds to have new managers he says the manager is the key 
not the fund 
in the universe of the funds he follows only one in five has 
been operating with the same people at the helm for 10 years or 
more 
for a final test of his argument jacobs checked actual 
performance records of new vs older funds for various periods in 
more recent times through the third quarter of this year 
on the list of the top 25 performers since the beginning of 
1986 56 percent were funds organized in 1980 or later for the 
period since the lows after the 1987 market crash the newcomers 
share swelled to 80 percent over the most recent 12 months it 
stood at 60 percent 
jacobss conclusion age discrimination is unwarranted when 
shopping for a mutual fund young funds are no problem he 
says as long as they are performing well

in one stroke american airlines has become a 
significant international carrier through the 471 million purchase 
of latin american and european routes and other assets from 
struggling eastern airlines and its parent texas air corp 
the longanticipated deal announced tuesday increases 
americans central and south american destinations from one city in 
venezuela to 20 in 15 countries it also gives american its second 
london route in two days and easterns unused route authority from 
miami to madrid spain 
american chairman robert l crandall said today the deal will 
allow american to fully realize our aspirations in latin 
america and eastern to gain badly needed cash as it tries to emerge 
from chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
in a news conference in miami today noted that the deal must be 
approved by the us department of transportation but added we 
certainly think it should be approved this is a very good 
transaction 
american besides being the no 1 domestic airline serves seven 
mexican destinations and about 20 in the caribbean plus has a 
growing presence in europe where it has 5 percent of the market 
and the pacific 
the agreement followed by one day americans 195 million 
purchase from trans world airlines inc of a chicagolondon route 
plus facilities at chicagos ohare international airport in 
addition american paid 400000 monday for braniffs landing 
rights at chicago and new york 
all the purchases require approval by various government 
agencies in addition the eastern transactions must be approved by 
a us bankruptcy court judge in new york 
american has been pursuing the expansion of its international 
operations from some time crandall said tuesday this 
transaction will allow our company to continue building its 
international network and it will make the united states a 
stronger competitor in central and south america by linking that 
region to americans extensive domestic route system 
the purchase includes gates at several us airports currently 
held by eastern and sister carrier continental airlines plus 
eastern facilities at us puerto rican and south american 
airports 
as part of the agreement continental will drop a 1 billion 
antitrust lawsuit against sabre the computer reservation system 
owned by americans parent amr corp of fort worth 
texas air based in houston said the deal would pump 349 
million into eastern which is struggling to emerge from bankruptcy 
court protection next year 
continental which is selling is miamilondon route will 
realize 1025 million system one texas airs computer 
reservations system will net 195 million through the sale of 
telecommunication and data processing systems needed to service the 
latin american routes 
the sale of these assets will enable eastern airlines to 
continue on its course of successfully rebuilding as a smaller and 
stronger airline for the future with its operations centered at 
its atlanta hub texas air said in a statement 
eastern also said it would sell the 14 lockheed1011s it uses on 
the latin american routes the planes which are an older smaller 
version of the widebody jet could bring in about 200 million 
according to analysts estimates 
american which has spent billions this year buying new aircraft 
to serve its expansion plans says it is not interested in the jets 
analysts generally applauded americans purchases of the routes 
they say the carriers expansion beyond us borders is necessary 
if it is to become a player internationally 
the deals also could have the pleasant side effect of making amr 
less attractive to a corporate raider by decreasing cash and 
depressing earnings 
these are good longterm moves and if they affect earnings in 
the short term they can deal with that said analyst mark 
daugherty at dean witter reynolds inc in new york 
analyst helane becker of shearson lehman hutton inc sounded a 
warning note however 
i really think that you dont necessarily want to take 500 
million or 200 million cash and give it to a competitor that would 
be out of business in a year she said referring to eastern and 
twa you sort of have to wonder if they could buy these assets 
out of bankruptcy at a cheaper price than theyre doing today 
amr shares closed tuesday at 60 up 275 in new york stock 
exchange trading 
american has been expanding vigorously this year buying 
airplanes to fly its newly acquired or soughtafter routes 
beginning work on a 400 million maintenance facility expanding 
domestic operations and fighting off a takeover from billionaire 
donald trump 
american has broadened its european service significantly this 
year and already has approval for more routes next year when it 
will reach about 165 flights weekly to 18 european cities 
six years ago it flew to none 
expansion also is under way in the pacific where american next 
year will begin flying to sydney australia and auckland new 
zealand the airline also is trying to add a second tokyo flight 
the growth has been financed through record profits although 
crandall has warned the performance wont continue this quarter or 
next year

the surprise attack by us forces in panama helped push the 
dollar higher today but other financial markets reacted only 
mildly to the military intervention 
on wall street the dow jones industrial average was up about 4 
points to the 2700 level by noon est but in the broader market 
declining stocks slightly outnumbered advances on the new york 
stock exchange 
us treasury bond prices were unchanged to slightly higher in 
midday trading in new york 
president bush ordered troops into action following several days 
of tension triggered by the weekend shooting death of a us 
military officer in panama by defense forces controlled by gen 
manuel antonio noriega 
currency dealers said the dollar rose sharply against other 
major currencies just after the military action became known early 
today 
in japan the dollar closed at 14423 yen up 043 yen from 
tuesday it started the trading day at 14392 yen and ranged 
between 1439014425 yen by midday in europe the dollar was up 
against all currencies except the yen while gold prices moved 
higher 
the dollar remained firm in early new york dealings 
in times of international tension investors often look for safe 
havens and usually turn to the dollar and precious metals 
gabriele schmitt a trader with the bank of new york said she 
expected the dollar to be stable in the near term because of the 
uncertainty in panama 
there are still a lot of question marks she said noriega 
still has a lot of support in his country i wouldnt rule him 
out entirely 
but stock analysts said most investors did not view the unrest 
in panama as a reason for making big changes in their strategies 
the initial reaction is one of a nonevent it might have an 
impact if it becomes a prolonged situation said dennis e 
jarrett a technical analyst with kidder peabody amp co 
larry wachtel a vice president for prudentialbache securities 
inc agreed weve been involved in limited military 
engagements before this looks like a military engagement that will 
be over shortly 
wachtel said oil and defense stocks were getting a boost from 
the panama invastion however

concern that the closure of the panama canal might disrupt oil 
shipments but prices fell back later in the trading session 
on the new york mercantile exchange the february contract for 
west texas intermediate the leading grade of us crude oil was 
down around 5 cents at 2121 per 42gallon barrel by midday today 
the january home heating oil contract strengthened in recent 
days from a cold spell that hit parts of the nation was up 054 
cent to 7685 cents a gallon after rising nearly 2 cents earlier 
in the trading session 
i think the reaction to the panama closure was totally 
irrational said bob baker an energy analyst with 
prudentialbache securities inc our crude oil supplies simply 
wont be disrupted 
baker said that only a small percentage of crude shipped to the 
united states passes through the panama canal and the tankers that 
travel through the canal could be rerouted around south america

state comptroller gerald lewis today 
began legal action to remove david l paul as chairman of centrust 
bank of miami claiming paul has used floridas largest savings and 
loan to support his opulent lifestyle 
lewis filed an administrative complaint that seeks removal of 
paul as chairman of the thrift paul has 21 days to either contest 
the complaint through a state hearing or comply with it 
centrust said it would oppose efforts to oust paul and called 
lewis action was selfserving 
this campaign is clearly aimed at generating favorable 
publicity for the comptroller and supporting his own reelection 
campaign whatever the cost to centrust its shareholders and its 
customers the company said in a statement 
the complaint charged that paul used centrust employees to 
perform personal services charged the savings and loan for 
thousands of dollars in personal bills and engaged in other 
questionable financial transactions 
paul maintained an opulent lifestyle largely at the expense of 
the association and generally treated a federally insured 
financial institution and public company as it if were his own 
public piggy bank lewis said in the complaint 
pauls actions were unsound and unsafe business practices that 
violated his duty as an officer of a financial institution the 
complaint charged 
the complaint was filed 11 days after federal regulators also 
citing centrusts lavish spending practices ordered the 
institution to stop squandering its assets on fine art sailboats 
excessive executive salaries and other personal expenses 
terence mcelroy spokesman for the comptrollers office said 
the action today was highly unusual 
but its a fairly unusual institution mcelroy said 
the complaint questioned pauls 48 million in salary between 
january 1988 and september of this year during a time when the 
thrift suffered operating losses of 76 million before taxes 
centrust also bought some 30 million in art in 1988 without 
lewis approval spent thousands of dollars on executives hotels 
bills and used highprices limousines to ferry the thrifts 
officers around miami the complaint charged 
the complaint also noted that 150000 in centrust assets 
including security equipment video cameras office supplies 
telephones and air conditioners were kept at pauls home on la 
gorce island in miami 
when federal regulators made their charges earlier this month 
paul issued a statement saying he had turned around a previously 
insolvent thrift and reduced its losses 
we have achieved that without one penny of federal assistance 
while investing millions of dollars in developing a firstrate 
institution with the financial strength in place to meet the need 
of our customers paul said at the time

the us economy grew at an annual rate of 3 
percent from july through september the government said today but 
analysts say it has slowed dramatically during the fourth quarter 
the economic deterioration has led many anlaysts to urge the 
federal reserve to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy 
the central bank did add money to the banking system late tuesday 
leading to the belief that it might permit interest rates to fall 
again 
in its final report on thirdquarter economic activity the 
commerce department said the gross national product was revised 
upward 03 percentage point from the 27 percent rate reported last 
month 
many economists had predicted no change from november in the 
figure released today 
the change was attributed to another upward revision in net 
exports and a downward revision in personal consumption 
the gnp is the nations total output of goods and services and 
its broadest measure of economic health 
the report bore good news for the feds goal of restraining 
inflation a price index tied to the gnp rose at an annual rate of 
29 percent during the julyseptember period unchanged from last 
months report 
it is the feds highinterest policy that is blamed in part 
for the fourthquarter sluggishness particularly in the automobile 
and other manufacturing industries 
the federal open market committee the central banks 
policymaking arm met privately monday and tuesday to consider 
monetary policy but as usual did not announce whether it would 
permit rates to continue to fall 
however the key federal funds rate the interest banks charge 
each other for overnight loans dropped to 8 716 percent from 
about 8 percent late tueday analysts said they expected a target 
of 8 percent for the rate 
besides manufacturing sluggishness other disruptions in 
fourthquarter growth are expected from the boeing aircraft strike 
the lingering effects of hurricane hugo and the san francisco 
bayarea earthquake 
in a companion report the commerce department said aftertax 
profits of us corporations fell 54 percent in the third quarter 
that was a revision from the 72 percent decline reported last 
month 
corporate profits have dropped for three consecutive quarters 
they were down 03 percent in the first quarter and 11 percent in 
the second 
consumer spending which accounts for twothirds of all economic 
activity was revised to show a 56 percent growth rate compared to 
the 62 percent gain reported last month 
the various changes left the gnp expanding in the third quarter 
at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 416 trillion 
todays report was the third on the julyseptember gnp in its 
initial estimate in october the commerce department said the 
thirdquarter economy would grow at a 25 percent annual rate 
last months initial revision was due mainly to 
betterthanexpected trade performance the september trade 
deficit which hit a fiveyear low was not available when the 
advance estimate was made in october 
todays revision reflects additional data that has become 
available 
while the economy surprised many analysts with its 3 percent 
growth durin the first nine months of the year it has declined 
significantly this quarter and some economists fear it will drop 
below 1 percent and perhaps even trip into a recession 
the administration is forecasting a 27 percent growth rate for 
all of 1989 the fourthquarter gnp would have to advance 16 
percent to meet that goal 
much of the growth in the third quarter was attributed to robust 
automobile sales that were driven by sales incentives automakers 
dropped the incentives with the introduction of 1990 models in 
october and sales plummeted 
but david berson chief economist for the federal national 
mortgage association noted that incentives are being restored and 
predicted a pickup in sales starting in january 
the feds highinterest policy is intended to curb inflation as 
inflation appeared to moderate the central bank has gradually 
eased interest rates since last june 
but many economists say rates still are too high and are 
stifling growth even threatening an end to an unprecedented seven 
years of peacetime growth 
fourthquarter growth is about 08 percent said donald 
ratajczak economic forecasting director at georgia state 
university he said growth in the first three months of 1990 will 
be about 1 percent 
but im expecting a couple of prime rate cuts and if we dont 
see them we might turn our forecast to the negative he said 
robert brusca chief financial economist for nikko securities 
co international inc also suggested the fed should consider 
further easing interest rates 
i think the fed will have to move to reduce interest rates in 
order to keep the economy going next year but i think theyre 
going to have to do it slowly he said

hillsborough holdings corp the parent 
company of jim walter corp said today it was prepared to file for 
chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if its bondholders did not agree 
to financial restructuring 
kohlberg kravis roberts amp co of new york acquired 
hillsborough holdings as part of its 24 billion acquisition of 
jim walter last year the tampabased building materials company is 
currently fighting a 3 billion asbestosrelated lawsuit 
the proposed bankruptcy move would be the first involving a 
large company acquired by kohlberg kravis the leader among 
leveraged buyout firms and could have an effect on the junk bond 
market that has financed many takeovers 
hillsborough officials said the bankruptcy filing was expected 
to be made dec 27 if an exchange offer for 624 million worth of 
the companys bonds were not accepted by at least 80 percent of the 
companys bondholders 
kohlberg kravis has apparently failed to persuade a group of 
hillsboroughs senior bondholders to accept a proposed financial 
restructuring of the company 
if the pending exchange offers are not consummated on their 
current terms and conditions hillsborough and certain of its 
subsidiaries may have no alternative but to file voluntary 
petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 said david 
townsend hillsborough holdings spokesman 
if the offer is not accepted hillsborough faces the prospect of 
having to repay its notes in full which it told bondholders at a 
meeting tuesday that it could not do 
hillsboroughs financial problems began last summer when it was 
named in the classaction lawsuit 
because of the suit kohlberg kravis has been unable to sell off 
jim walters assets and without the proceeds from the sales the 
company cannot meet its upcoming debt payments

we think the panama situation is very much a smoke screen 
and an excuse to buy dollars said one london dealer if the 
market was genuinely frightened from the news why didnt gold also

havens in times of turmoil

political instability and a staggering economy 
are threatening to bust beijings booming market for foreignoffice 
space 
dozens of highrise office buildings are opening in the capital 
this year and next at a time when many overseas companies are 
reducing operations in china or putting off new investment 
its going to be survival of the fittest said james r 
pitchon of richard ellis property consultant for the world trade 
center beijings biggest building project we have a baby market 
here and things have been made worse by the current economic 
situation 
pitchon estimated that by the end of 1990 there will be nearly 
double the amount of office space currently required by the 1100 
foreign companies with offices in beijing 
it will be a drastic turnaround from even a year ago when more 
than half of all foreigners were working out of chinese hotel rooms 
with peeling paint antiquated telephones and stalled elevators 
foreign companies began moving representatives into beijing 
around 1980 with the advent of deng xiaopings economic reforms and 
open door policy but it was not until 1985 with the opening of 
the 29story china international trust and investment corp citic 
building that a select few companies had their first access to 
modern office space 
in 1986 the holiday inn lido complex of hotel apartments and 
offices opened for businessmen and the next year the 23story noble 
tower a project marked by bitter disputes between its chinese and 
canadian partners began taking in tenants 
but that still provided only about 57000 square yards of office 
space by next year the figure will be five times as great 
heading the newcomers is the world trade center a joint venture 
with hong kongbased kerry industrial co that features a 38story 
tower with 61000 square yards of office space two 30story luxury 
apartment buildings and two hotels with more than 1000 rooms 
among the competition is the jing guang center a 51story 
officeapartmenthotel built with hong kong and japanese 
participation the 20story fortune building financed by japans 
nomura securities group the hua wei center a norwegianchinese 
apartmentbusiness project with 23000 square yards of office 
space and capital mansion a citic undertaking with a 52story 
officeapartment building 
their openings however are clouded by the june military 
crackdown on the prodemocracy movement and an austerity policy 
that has stalled the economy and left in doubt the future direction 
of chinas marketoriented reforms few companies have left china 
but many have trimmed expatriate staff or canceled plans for 
further investment 
many foreign businesses likely will wait one or two years before 
deciding the extent of their commitment to china some real estate 
experts say and investing in costly new office quarters will not 
be a top priority 
most of the projects are months behind schedule because of 
typical construction delays in china compounded by work stoppages 
during the political turmoil of this spring the world trade 
originally slated to cost 380 million now will require 450 
million due to expense overruns 
many projects such as the twotower asiapacific building 
financed partly by singaporean and japanese funds have asked for 
rescheduling of loans and extensions of joint venture contracts 
because of expected slow returns on investment 
the chinese partner in the world trade center the ministry of 
foreign economic relations and trade has already agreed to extend 
the life of the joint venture from 20 to 30 years 
at least one major project a planned 17story hotel and office 
building involving the japanese builder takenaka komuten 
mitsubishi bank and japan air lines halted construction after june 
we havent abandoned the project takenaka spokesman fujio 
takeuchi said in tokyo but he said the project team is waiting for 
the domestic situation in china to return to normal 
another project citics capital mansion has been hit by 
construction delays and financing problems and according to some 
foreign real estate experts is a white elephant 
capital mansion deputy general manager yang long said the 
building will not open until the end of 1990 he expressed 
confidence the project would succeed but said it isnt signing 
contracts yet and we face serious competition 
its a race against time said george p maier chief 
operations officer of the jing guang center those already taking 
in tenants have a big advantage he said 
the jing guang began filling its offices and apartments in 
december and the world trade center will have 115 tenants about 60 
percent occupancy by the end of january 
the fortune building promoted by its japanese managers as a 
hightechnology office complex with a satellite transmission 
network has about 40 mostly japanese tenants and foresees 
occupancy of about 65 percent next year 
the norwegian hua wei center which wont open until next 
summer has leased only 20 percent of its office space and like 
many others is offering flexible terms to attract customers 
the center is asking 35 per square yard a month but sales 
manager dorophy leung said this price is negotiable and we will 
offer discounts 
the world trade center has also cut its rates from near 40 to 
about 35 a square yard 
office buildings also may face competition from newly built 
hotels which face an even greater glut in the near future because 
of the postjune collapse of the tourist market the state 
councilowned capital hotel with an occupancy rate of 30 percent 
recently began advertising guest suites for use as offices 
according to one survey there will be about 24000 rooms in 
westernstyle hotels in beijing by 1991 double that of 1988 and 
seven times the figure in 1983 
developers said the oversupply problem should eventually work 
itself out but much depends on chinas political stability and 
economic health it could be a boom town said the world trade 
centers pitchon and it could be a ghost town

upjohn co said wednesday it would phase 
out production of industrial chemicals at a north haven conn 
plant and take a 200 million charge against fourthquarter 
earnings to reflect that and other restructuring steps 
upjohn would scale back production at the plant and planned to 
sell its industrial chemical product lines and technologies next 
year chairman theodore cooper said in a statement 
the industrial chemical business no longer fits our corporate 
strategy cooper said adding that the north haven plant had 
become unprofitable because of a number of factors including 
obsolescence competition and shrinking markets 
most of the 178 jobs at the plant would be phased out by the end 
of 1992 some through normal attrition and early retirement 
incentives the company said 
upjohn said 65 percent of the 200 million charge was 
attributable to the phaseout of the north haven plant while the 
other 35 percent was due to a previouslyannounced special 
retirement plan and other onetime expenses 
industrial chemicals include benzephonone used in soaps and 
perfumes dcna used in dyes and as an agricultural fungicide and 
dichlorobenzidine used in making yellow ink and dye pigments 
upjohn spokesman jp lambrechts said

on a conference room wall at nintendo of 
america incs headquarters hangs a 20footlong picture frame 
crammed with hundreds of snapshots and school photos of children 
theyre pictures kids just sent on their own says nintendo 
spokesman bill white usually with a note about how they did on a 
nintendo video game 
for a company that gets thousands of photos tens of thousands 
of letters and millions of phone calls from customers 1990 may 
pose a problem how to keep that loyalty 
with a nintendo entertainment system in one out of nearly four 
american households toy industry watchers wonder whether the 
market is getting saturated 
i look at nintendo as a fad that is moving into its fourth 
year says paul valentine an analyst at standard amp poors corp 
in new york if for no other reason he said that makes nintendo 
vulnerable to a slump 
weve certainly seen the predictions of the doomsayers that 
weve reached saturation says white that certainly hasnt 
been the case 
nevertheless gamesters and marketeers at nintendo are hustling 
to keep their topselling toy fresh among customers beyond 
scouting new and more detailed games ideas range from store 
within a store retail displays to marketing tieins with pepsi to 
a featurelength movie 
this christmas nintendo introduced its handheld game game 
boy which it hopes will sell 1 million units it forecasts 
selling 9 million of the entertainment system consoles this year 
by late 1990 nintendo plans to have its nes network 
running which will allow the machines to be used to trade 
securities and mutual funds through fidelity investments and for 
game players to compete in nationwide tournaments 
at nintendos us headquarters in this seattle suburb the 
bustling hallways jingling phones and jammed shipping docks during 
the christmas selling season testified to the prosperity of a 
company thats had the nations no1 toy the past three years 
the subsidiary of nintendo co ltd of japan projects more than 
27 billion in retail sales for 1989 1 billion more than last 
year and nearly nine times as much as in 1986 
this year nec home electronics usa inc and sega of 
america inc also subsidiaries of japanese companies brought out 
competing machines offering more computing power than nintendos 
atari corp also has introduced a competitor to game boy called 
lynx 
still nintendo claims a 79 percent share of a video game market 
it estimates at 34 billion its japanese parent may introduce a 
more highpowered system in japan next summer white said 
nintendo expects to have sold 20 million video game systems by 
the end of this year with the devices in 22 percent of all us 
households 
but valentine said he thinks sales will drop sharply in 1990 
toy crazes he says just dont last over three or four years 
i think when the fad goes well see a sharp contraction of 
sales anywhere from 40 to 70 percent over two years he said 
still he said that would leave video games as the largest 
category within the toy industry 
many toy makers are hoping nintendo crashes says larry carlat 
editor of toy and hobby world magazine it probably will be down 
but a lot of it is wishful thinking he said 
no company has been really able to hold onto a smash and be 
able to manage it in the past its always been a boom and bust 
cycle carlat said it doesnt look like that is going to 
happen with nintendo people in the toy business use the term soft 
landing 
nintendo introduced its game system in 1983 in japan and has 
sold it to 37 percent of households there the goal nintendo says 
is similar market penetration in north america and europe 
nintendo has been credited with reviving the video game 
industry which had all but vanished by the early 1980s because of 
poor quality software it did so by carefully contolling licensing 
and manufacture of the games that can be played on its system 
white says there are encouraging signs of market longevity in 
the united states two years ago he said 75 percent to 80 percent 
of the primary users of nintendo games were boys aged 6 to 14 the 
interest has broadened he said so that segment only represents 46 
percent of the main users today 
men 18 and older now make up 30 percent of the primary users 
while women and girls comprise a 24 percent share white said 
the biggest change has been the widespread adoption of the 
nintendo entertainment system as a true entertainment option to 
television video cassettes or stereos he said 
nintendo does its best to cultivate fan loyalty white says it 
has 400 game counselors at its us headquarters who handle 
140000 calls a week from stumped players 
its magazine nintendo power has 18 million subscribers the 
company gets 15000 letters a week and a roomful of writers 
responds to each personally 
youve got to bond with them white says 
so far nintendo has lent its name to 200 licensed products 
from sweatshirts to dolls bedsheets to breakfast cereal its also 
set up about 5000 world of nintendo store displays to sell the 
merchandise 
in addition there are two television series earlier this month 
a nintendothemed movie the wizard opened nationally 
while the licensing earns money it also is a powerful marketing 
tool for nintendo white said likewise he said a christmastime 
promotion with pepsi broadens nintendos advertising 
white however said the tieins and licensing deals still are 
secondary to the core of the industry the games 
nintendo has sold 101 million individual games and hopes for a 
new hit when it brings out super mario bros 3 next year a far 
more intricate version of this years bestselling game he said

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
lower wednesday on the chicago board of trade paced by moderate 
losses in the soybean market linked in part to the closing of the 
panama canal 
but anne frick senior oilseed analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc said the decline in soybean prices mostly 
represented a continuation of a seasonal trend 
trading activity was very light with many traders getting an 
early start on the holiday weekend 
the panama canal was closed to traffic wednesday as us armed 
forces launched a surprise assault in panama in an attempt to 
capture panamian leader manuel noriega 
shipments of us soybeans to japan pass through the panama 
canal but anne frick senior oilseed analyst with prudentialbache 
securities inc said the closing of the canal was a pretty minor 
factor in the markets decline 
it certainly is premature to think any serious or permanent 
export disruption would be caused by it she said 
soybean prices had slipped lower in the two previous trading 
sessions 
at the close wheat futures were unchanged to 1 cent lower with 
the contract for delivery in march at 413 a bushel corn was 
unchanged to 1 cents lower with march at 238 a bushel oats 
were cent to cent lower with march at 152 a bushel soybeans 
were 3 cents to 5 cents lower with january at 574 a bushel

billionaire donald trump reportedly is among 
bidders weighing a possible purchase of bloomingdales but the 
department store chains troubled owner campeau corp declined 
wednesday to confirm trumps interest 
campeau spokeswoman carol sanger said the company intends to 
maintain silence for the duration of the sale process the identity 
of the bidders will not be disclosed and all negotiations are 
confidential 
the only thing the company has been willing to say in the past 
is that no more than five or six parties would advance to the 
second stage of the bidding no word on who will acquire the 
17store upscale chain is expected until sometime in february 
campeau said on dec 8 the day the initial stage of the sale 
process was concluded 
susan heilbron a spokeswoman for the trump organization also 
declined to comment on a report wednesday in the wall street 
journal that said trump is one of the bidders who will advance to 
round 2 
trump is known primarily as a property developer included in 
his vast holdings are an airline and a stake in a new york 
department store chain alexanders 
alexanders announced on wednesday that at the urging of trump 
and another stockholder the retailer had hired the investment 
banking firm morgan stanley amp co to consider strategic 
alternatives to maximize stockholder value including the possible 
sale of the company 
the retailer said there was no assurance that any transaction 
would occur 
ms heilbron dismissed speculation that trump might favor a sale 
of alexanders to raise money to help pay for bloomingdales she 
said trump and steven roth who each own 272 percent of 
alexanders have been advocating changes for years in the way 
alexanders has been run 
she said she wouldnt rule out the possibility that trump might 
pursue a takeover of the share of alexanders he doesnt already 
control alexanders operates 11 stores in the new york 
metropolitan area 
besides trump the bidders for bloomingdales include shopping 
center owner jmb realty corp based in chicago japans tokyu 
department store co and a group led by joseph e brooks chairman 
of the ann taylor stores the journal said citing unidentified 
sources

traub also is among the contenders a spokeswoman for the chain 
katie locke said 
ira millstein an adviser to traub and a senior partner with the 
law firm weil gotshal amp manges told the journal that the traub 
group is trying to arrange financing for a possible bid he said 
the group is engaged in serious discussions with potential 
financial partners 
a sixth bidder possibly japanese also is believed to be 
involved in the bidding the journal said 
campeau a canadian real estate company with extensive retail 
holdings in the united states was forced to put bloomingdales up 
for sale in september as part of a plan to cope with a severe cash 
squeeze and an enormous debt load

to oust the head of floridas largest savings and loan claiming he 
used 45 million in depositors money to bankroll an art collection 
and extravagant lifestyle 
david l paul chairman and chief executive officer of centrust 
bank of miami has 21 days to resign or contest a complaint filed 
by comptroller gerald lewis a statement released by centrust said 
paul would vigorously oppose removal 
paul maintained an opulent lifestyle largely at the expense of 
the association and generally treated a federally insured financial 
institution and public company as it if were his own public piggy 
bank lewis said in the complaint 
the complaint claimed paul violated his duty as officer of a 
financial institution by using centrust employees to perform 
personal services charging the company for personal bills and 
buying luxuries

including 12 million paid for peter paul rudens portrait of a 
man as mars some of the paintings were kept at pauls miami 
beach home before state regulators ordered them sold 
the complaint also questioned pauls 48 million salary from 
january 1988 to september 1989 when the thrift suffered pretax 
operating losses of 76 million 
centrust said in a statement the charges were not justified and 
the thrift had improved net worth signficantly during pauls six 
years in charge and accused the comptroller of a campaign of 
harassment and disinformation 
centrust with 9 billion in assets is floridas largest thrift 
and the 22nd largest in the country it has 70 branches most in 
south florida 
but the thrift has steadily lost money for more than a year 
including 91 million in the quarter ended sept 30 
the comptrollers complaint was filed 12 days after federal 
regulators also citing centrusts lavish spending practices 
ordered the institution to stop squandering assets 
the us office of thrift supervision barred centrust from 
increasing executives salaries ordered it to sell a 233000 
sailboat and prohibited centrust from spending any more money on 
pauls yacht the grand cru 
other expenses questioned by lewis include 
a 61 million centrust loan to paul to buy and improve his 
house and property as well as payment by centrust of telephone 
garbage and lawn bills in 198687 
a 5 million executive retirement system begun in 1986 with 
deposits in an english bank lewis contends the system has 
insufficient documentation 
14 million a year to lease a corporate jet and hangar at 
miami international airport as well as 26000 a year for a 
mercedesbenz limousine 40000 to purchase a lincoln limousine 
kept in new york and 33000 in other car expenses 
363000 for security guard service at pauls home the past two 
years 
150000 in bank assets kept at pauls home including security 
equipment video cameras office supplies telephones and air 
conditioners 
47000 spent by paul in 1988 during a 35night stay at a new 
york hotel the average daily expense was 1186 
centrust has sought federal approval to sell 63 branches and 
their accounts to great western financial of beverly hills calif 
centrust also is planning to convert from a state charter to a 
federal charter

the energy futures market ended mixed in 
volatile trading wednesday erasing much of its earlier gains that 
stemmed from news of a sudden us military strike in panama 
prices for crude and refined petroleum products had been up 
sharply earlier in the trading day wednesday on fears that the 
closure of the panama canal following the surprise attack by 
american forces might disrupt oil shipments 
but analysts said the market had overreacted 
i think the reaction to the panama closure was totally 
irrational bob baker an energy analyst with prudentialbache 
said our crude oil supplies simply wont be disrupted 
analysts said that only a small percentage of crude shipped to 
the united states passes through the panama canal because the 
waterway is too small to handle large tankers 
on the new york mercantile exchange the february contract for 
west texas intermediate the leading grade of us crude oil was 
down 7 cents to settle at 2121 per 42gallon barrel the contract 
was up 11 cents on tuesday 
among refined petroleum products the january wholesale home 
heating oil contract supported in recent days from a cold spell 
that hit parts of the nation rose 075 cent to settle at 7576 
cents a gallon on tuesday the contract gained 035 cent 
january wholesale unleaded gasoline which lost 058 cent in the

the dollar finished mostly lower wednesday in 
foreign exchange trading in the united states after ending mixed 
overseas in what dealers called a muted response to the us 
military intervention in panama 
gold investors appeared to discard news of the military action 
as prices edged higher in new york after falling in europe and 
asia republic national bank in new york quoted a bid for a troy 
ounce of gold at 41305 as of 4 pm est up 130 from tuesdays 
late bid 
the dollar wound up lower against every major currency except 
the japanese yen and canadian dollar in new york in europe it 
rose against the yen canadian dollar and dutch guilder but fell 
against other major currencies 
dealers in europe said the dollar rose early in the trading day 
in reaction to news of the us military action in panama 
but the dollar reversed course midway through the us trading 
day when the federal reserve took steps to inject reserves into the 
financial system a move that was viewed as a sign that it may be 
encouraging lower interest rates 
falling interest rates reduce demand for dollars because the 
decline cuts the yields available to foreigners on their 
dollardenominated investments 
richard levine vice president for foreign exchange and precious 
metals at elders futures inc in new york said trading was 
relatively light all day 
you could tell there was no real conviction he said 
referring to the markets assessment of the impact of both the 
military action and the feds move to make more money available 
within the financial system 
he said the market viewed the us military action as a sign 
of strength but recognized the move was a limited regional 
action which was not likely to have global ramifications 
the subsequent decline in the dollar also came on low volume 
levine said because traders remember that they misinterpreted a 
similar move by the central bank a few weeks ago as an indication 
it was easing its credit policy 
he also noted that as the end of the year approaches banks that 
otherwise would be active in the currency markets are not trading 
most of the major banks have squared their banks for the year 
he said 
in tokyo the dollar rose to 14423 japanese yen from 14380 yen 
at tuesdays close later in london it was quoted at 14390 yen 
in new york the dollar edged up to 14393 yen from 14365 yen late

european food concern tlc beatrice international 
incs decision to scrap a public stock offering to raise up to 
194 million reflects a general weakness in the market for new 
issues analysts said wednesday 
the move also postponed what would have been two firsts the 
first former beatrice cos holding to go public since a 6 billion 
takeover in 1986 and the first blackowned company to be listed on 
the new york stock exchange 
tlc beatrice on tuesday canceled the offering of 185 million 
shares of stock priced from 9 to 1050 a share a successful 
offering would have raised between 167 million and 194 million 
the company controlled by investor reginald f lewis cited 
weak market conditions and a lack of interest from institutional 
investors in canceling the plan to offer a 35 percent interest to 
the public 
its not what i would call a hot new issues market said 
norman fosback president of the institute for econometric research 
in fort lauderdale fla which analyzes new stock issues 
offerings tend to be overpriced 
my sense is that there is very little demand for offerings 
from individual investors and institutions are dominating the 
market said fosback who did not recommend the tlc beatrice 
issue 
robert baumbach a new issues analyst for standard amp poors 
corp said in a report that the tlc beatrice shares were priced at 
about 20 times what he estimated the companys 1989 earnings would 
be if it already were public 
there have been 194 initial public offerings by companies this 
year through tuesday down from 222 in the same 1988 period and 516 
in the same 1987 period according to securities data co 
the value of ipos rose 43 percent from 1988 to 55 billion 
but dropped 566 percent from 128 billion in the 1987 period the 
figures showed 
a group of investors led by lewis bought beatrices 
international foods operations for 985 million in december 1987 
the entire company was taken private the previous year by kohlberg 
kravis roberts co the leader in debtfinanced takeovers known as 
leveraged buyouts 
tlc beatrice raised 875 million through asset sales to help pay 
off debt company officials said they said the remaining 34 
million in acquisition debt was retired this week but the company 
still has close to 170 million in longterm debt 
as of sept 30 the company had assets of 624 million 
including about 154 million in cash it expects 1989 operating 
profits of 75 million on sales of 11 billion 
the market for initial public equity offerings has tightened 
up in general tlc beatrice senior vice president everett grant 
said 
we thought it was an attractive window to access the public 
equity markets he said however the window did not appear as 
attractive as it might have been 
grant said the company has not ruled out issuing the stock at a 
later time 
tlc beatrice owns 15 companies including franprix a food 
wholesaler in the paris area tayto irelands largest snack food 
company and seven ice cream distributors in europe

american airlines chairman robert l crandall said 
wednesday his deal to buy foreign routes and other assets of 
eastern airlines should be approved by government regulators in 
the national interest 
failure to allow the deal would invite greater control of 
international air travel by foreign carriers crandall said a press 
conference called to discuss details of the 471 million purchase 
announced tuesday 
the complex deal with eastern parent texas air corp gives 
american control of easterns prized latin american routes and 
would greatly enhance americans presence in foreign markets 
the purchase is subject to review by the justice and 
transportation departments and the us bankruptcy court overseeing 
easterns chapter 11 reorganization 
we think it benefits consumers the citizens of miami 
americans shareholders and employees and benefits every us 
citizen crandall said 
some us officials including transportation secretary samuel 
skinner have expressed qualms about whether international route 
authorities granted by governments should be sold 
crandall said the deal gives eastern needed cash as it 
reorganizes into a carrier that is focusing on atlanta and would 
give the international routes to a carrier that can use them more 
effectively 
since foreign governments restrict the number of us carriers 
allowed to fly to their countries easterns financial difficulties 
presented american with a major opportunity to realize its 
ambitions to become a major international carrier american wants 
to expand in the pacific he added but japan remains very 
restrictive 
american is a fastgrowing company and we plan to continue 
that expansion through the 1990s crandall said 
the price of shares in americans parent amr corp lost 125 to 
5875 on the new york stock exchange wednesday 
the leader of easterns machinists union which began the 
crippling march 4 strike that led to easterns filing for chapter 
11 bankruptcy five days later said the proposed deal should be 
rejected 
quite honestly i dont look for this thing to get any quick 
approval charles e bryan said if theres any credibility 
with skinner and the department of justice people i would highly 
doubt that thing would be approved 
but bryan said it seems that texas air chairman frank 
lorenzo gets what he wants in washington he seems to have 
washington completely wired 
if government review results in approval of the deal american 
officials said americans daily departures out of miami will rise 
from the current 41 to about 80 in the second half of 1990 the 
increase would include 25 more daily domestic departures 
eastern which says it is dehubbing its home city is 
miamis no 1 carrier with 76 daily departures 
crandall said americans expansion in miami will add about 2000 
jobs there american plans to absorb some 2600 to 2700 employees 
in the latin american countries american will begin serving 
american officials said 
american spokesman ed martelle said the total includes all 
eastern employees in those countries employees of four south 
american ground handling companies in which eastern had interest 
and employees of the texas air computer reservations system system 
one 
peter dolara an american senior vice president said american 
would consider hiring some of the more than 2000 eastern pilots 
who were told the carrier had no jobs for them when they ended 
their strike last month dolara said though there was no 
commitment to hiring any eastern employees other than the ground 
personnel already working for eastern in the latin countries 
the deal increases americans central and south american 
destinations from one city in venezuela to 20 in 15 countries the 
package also includes a london route and easterns unused authority 
to fly from miami to madrid spain 
besides being the no 1 domestic airline american serves seven 
mexican destinations and about 20 in the caribbean it also has a 
growing presence in europe where it has 5 percent of the market 
and the pacific 
the purchase includes gates at several us airports currently 
held by eastern and sister carrier continental airlines plus 
eastern facilities at us puerto rican and south american 
airports 
as part of the agreement continental will drop a 1 billion 
antitrust lawsuit against sabre the computer reservation system 
owned by amr crandall said american paid full value for the texas 
air and eastern assets not extra money to settle the litigation 
texas air said the deal would pump 349 million into eastern 
continental which is selling the miamilondon route will realize 
1025 million system one will net 195 million through the sale 
of telecommunication and dataprocessing systems needed to service 
the latin american routes

jim walter corps parent company said 
wednesday it was prepared to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy 
protection in what would be a first among large firms taken private 
by buyout specialists kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
kohlberg kravis formed hillsborough holdings corp as part of 
its 24 billion takeover of the building materials company last 
year a bankruptcy court filing by the company could inject fresh 
jitters into the junkbond market that has financed such takeovers 
hillsborough officials said the bankruptcy filing was expected 
to be made dec 27 if an exchange offer for 624 million worth of 
the companys bonds was not accepted by at least 80 percent of the 
companys bondholders 
kohlberg kravis has apparently failed to persuade a group of 
hillsboroughs senior bondholders to accept a proposed financial 
restructuring of the company 
if the pending exchange offers are not consummated on their 
current terms and conditions hillsborough and certain of its 
subsidiaries may have no alternative but to file voluntary 
petitions for reorganization under chapter 11 said 
hillsboroughs spokesman david townsend 
if the offer is not accepted hillsborough faces the prospect of 
having to repay its notes in full which it told bondholders at a 
meeting tuesday that it could not do 
a chapter 11 filing would blemish the record of kohlberg kravis 
considered the dean of the leveraged buyout artists with the 25 
billion rjr nabisco deal to its credit but the hillsborough firm 
has some peculiar problems which are not necessarily symptomatic 
of widespread weakness among lbos experts said 
its not going to be that devastating said james grant 
publisher of a new york interest rate newsletter and a critic of 
leveraged buyouts hillsborough holdings had problems of its own 
that had nothing to do with the takeover 
the biggest problem grant said came last summer when jim 
walter was hit with a 3 billion asbestosrelated lawsuit because 
of the classaction suit kohlberg kravis has been unable to sell 
off jim walters assets and without the proceeds from the sales 
the company cannot meet its upcoming debt payments 
hillsborough is the third company owned by kohlberg kravis to 
encounter financial difficulties in recent months 
in august kohlberg kravis confirmed that seaman furniture co 
a leading furniture retailer could not meet its debt payments and 
might not be able to continue operating the companys debt 
payments were later rescheduled successfully 
sci television inc of which kohlberg kravis owns 45 percent 
is also involved in an exchange offer that is facing resistance 
from bondholders 
but neither of those kohlberg kravis holdings is as large as 
hillsborough

like other automakers ford provides incentives to dealers in

a federal judge wednesday put off a hearing 
on mobil oil corps request to keep under seal environmental 
documents filed in a lawsuit brought by a former executive who 
says he was fired for refusing to sanitize pollution reports 
us district judge harold a ackerman said he wanted to give 
mobils attorneys a chance to prepare arguments for their 
opposition to a request by the associated press to enter the case 
ackerman was to hear arguments wednesday on whether or not to 
make the documents public stephen wiley an attorney for the 
former employee said he favors unsealing the documents because 
they are directly relevant to a public proceeding 
an attorney for the ap richard eittreim said his arguments 
were similar to wileys but mobil attorney ron green said he 
wanted to respond to the aps legal papers which he received 
shortly before the hearing 
ackerman set a new date for friday and told the parties to 
submit more papers 
the former employee valcar bowman jr claims he was fired as 
mobil chemical cos environmental affairs manager for refusing to 
sanitize assessments of environmental problems at company 
plants nationwide he claims the companys legal office made 
changes to downplay pollution problems 
bowman 47 of riverdale ga worked at the princeton offices 
of mobil 
mobil denies the charge saying it had a right to fire bowman 
and did so as part of a legitimate economic cutback the company 
also denies altering the reports other than to make a few minor 
editing and typographical changes 
the parties dispute whether ackerman should unseal a series of

tlc beatrice international inc a food company 
controlled by investor reginald f lewis said tuesday it had 
scrapped plans to sell a 35 percent stake to the public 
the company cited unfavorable stock market conditions for 
abandoning the plan which was intended to raise as much as 194 
million 
lewis said the offer might have been poorly timed 
the time of the year and the market conditions right now were 
both factors he told the new york times also my sense is 
that there is now not much awareness in the institutional investor 
community about what is going on in europe or our company and how 
it fit into the picture in europe 
the underwriters of the proposed offering merrill lynch capital 
markets also advised tlc beatrice to withdraw the offer the 
company said 
the offering would have made tlc beatrice the first 
blackcontrolled company on the new york stock exchange it also 
would have left lewis with 58 percent of the shares he now has 55 
percent 
lewis created the company by acquiring the international 
operations of the former beatrice cos for 985 million in 1987
