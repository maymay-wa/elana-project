the odds the government is putting on an end 
to the drought over the next couple of months would likely be of 
little interest to even the most dedicated riverboat gambler 
the probability of getting enough rain to end the drought ranges 
from 1 in 500 for central iowa to 1 in 1000 for at least three 
other major drought regions the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration reports 
and looking back at history even that may be optimistic 
thats because never in the period that records have been kept 
has rainfall in august september and october in major 
droughtplagued areas been enough to end a shortage equivalent to 
todays 
in this weeks drought advisory the national climatic data 
center takes a look at four specific drought areas and what it 
finds isnt encouraging 
in central iowa for example the amount of rain needed by oct 
31 to end the drought totals 2242 inches that amount can be 
expected in the augustoctober period only once in 500 years the 
advisory said 
richard heim a meteorologist at the asheville nc data 
center said those were the best odds found in the four areas 
studied the other three all came out to one chance in 1000 of 
getting enough rain by the end of october to declare the drought 
broken 
those areas are northeastern montana near the north dakota 
border where 1036 inches of rain would be needed to end the 
drought the east slope of the cascades in washington where 1321 
inches would be needed and tennessee which would require 2198 
inches by oct 31 heim said 
only once in 1000 years can those regions expect that much rain 
in the months of august september and october he said 
in no prior year going back to 1895 did any of the four 
studied regions receive as much rain as they now need in the 
threemonth period according to records kept by the center 
the calculations are based on the detailed palmer drought index 
a system developed to allow scientists to measure shortages of 
moisture over the long term 
the system compares water available from precipitation and from 
stored soil moisture with water used by plants evaporation 
runoff people and to recharge lakes reservoirs and dry soil if 
incoming and outgoing water balance the reading is zero 
an index reading of minus 4 is termed severe drought and the 
drought is considered to have ended when the palmer reading gets 
back up to minus 05 since that is nearly a balance and indicates 
that much of the soil moisture has been replenished 
severe drought continues to afflict large areas of the nation 
despite some recent rains which provided shortterm moisture but 
did little to recharge depleted ground water supplies or to improve 
the conditions of many rivers and lakes palmer drought index 
readings range as high as minus 7 and minus 8 in some areas 
in addition to soil moisture problems restoring normal river 
and stream conditions in some regions could take years 
two to three years of above normal winter precipitation over 
the mountainous headwaters of the basin followed by above normal 
snowpack runoff for each of the years is needed to get the 
missouri river basin back to normal the national weather service 
hydrologic office reported 
for california the hydrologic office reports one year of 
normal winter precipitation followed by normal spring snowpack 
runoff would do the job 
the ohio and lower mississippi river basins the agency says 
could be restored to normal flows by a series of major low 
pressure systems producing at least 812 inches of rain over much 
of the ohio river basin over a twofour week period

regional disparities in personal incomes 
widened last year as strong economic growth continued for coastal 
states while states in americas heartland did not fare as well 
the government reports 
the commerce department said thursday that the current economic 
expansion is the first in 28 years in which regional differences in 
incomes have grown larger rather than narrowing 
the department said all 10 of the states with the highest 
average personal incomes last year were on the nations coasts 
eight along the atlantic and two california and alaska on the 
pacific 
connecticut ranked no 1 with residents earning 21266 for 
every man woman and child last year an increase of 88 percent 
over 1986 
for the entire nation incomes rose 6 percent to an average of 
15481 last year the best showing since a similar 6 percent 
increase in 1985 incomes had risen 51 percent in 1986 
the gain last year kept americans ahead of inflation which 
climbed 44 percent 
seven of the 10 states with the lowest incomes were in the 
south mississippi remained in last place with a per capita income 
of 10292 an increase of 65 percent over the previous year 
in contrast to most recovery periods regional economic 
differences have widened since the 198182 recession the report 
said 
the southwest and rocky mountain regions were farther behind the 
national income average in 1987 than they were in 1982 at the 
depths of the recession while new england and the midatlantic 
regions were farther ahead 
this has been a somewhat unusual economic expansion said 
rudolph depass a commerce department analyst regions like new 
england have benefited from rapid growth in hightech industries 
and relatively slow increases in population while the southwest 
and rocky mountain states have been hit by a slump in the oil 
industry 
new england was the topearning region in 1982 with incomes 9 
percent above the national average it increased that lead last 
year with incomes 20 percent above the national average the 
midatlantic region which had incomes 10 percent above the 
national average in 1982 had incomes 14 percent higher last year 
and the west had incomes 11 percent higher than the national 
average last year compared with 12 percent higher in 1982 
by contrast the southwest and rocky mountain regions saw their 
incomes fall to 12 percent below the national average in 1987 
compared with 4 percent or less in 1982 
this drop put these two regions close to the southeast which 
still came in last with incomes 13 percent below the national 
average the southeast had been 14 percent below in 1982 
the great lakes region was unchanged with incomes still 2 
percent below the national average in 1987 
the new figures are likely to supply ammunition for democratic 
charges that the reagan economic program while benefiting some 
sectors of the economy have left other areas far behind 
the democrats charge that the country has been turned into a 
bicoastal economy divided between healthy sections on both 
coasts and a problemplagued heartland afflicted by hard times in 
agriculture oil and declining smokestack industries 
new jersey with an average income of 20352 ranked second 
behind connecticut massachusetts was no 3 with an average income 
of 19142 followed by alaska 18230 and maryland 18124 
rounding out the top 10 were new york california new hampshire 
delaware and virginia 
in addition to mississippi states with the lowest incomes were 
west virginia with an average of 11020 followed by utah 
louisiana arkansas idaho new mexico alabama south carolina and 
kentucky 
thursdays report was based on revised figures that showed 
incomes overall grew at a stronger pace than estimated when the 
original report was released in april 
at that time the government said national per capita incomes 
rose 48 percent barely ahead of the 44 percent rise in consumer 
prices last year

the white house says it will not 
provide information sought by congressional investigators about 
alleged drug dealing by panamanian ruler manuel antonio noriega 
unless the scope of the investigation is reduced 
the announcement thursday by president reagans chief spokesman 
marlin fitzwater came as democratic presidential nominee michael 
dukakis accused the white house of stonewalling the probe by 
the general accounting office 
the inquiry could delve into republican presidential nominee 
george bushs knowledge of the noriega case 
bush who is promoting his role in administration antidrug 
efforts has denied having early knowledge of noriegas ties to the 
drug world or suppressing information about the matter for years 
noriega provided intelligence information to the cia which bush 
headed in the 1970s 
fitzwater in santa barbara while reagan vacations at his ranch 
north of here said administration officials had met with the gao 
in an effort to narrow the request which gao declined to do 
he said the gao request asks for a broad range of sensitive 
intelligence material information from open law enforcement files 
and material reflecting the deliberative decisionmaking process of 
the executive branch 
the administration told the gao on july 13 that it would need to 
complete a legal review before responding to the request fitzwater 
said 
the justice department has just completed that review and has 
concluded that the subject matter of the request is beyond gaos 
statutory authority he said the justice department has also 
concluded that even were the request within gaos legal authority 
there are statutory and constitutional objections to providing 
various specific categories of information requested 
based on this advice the white house spokesman said we 
cannot participate in the study as currently designed 
in miami dukakis said i think the white house does not want 
to cooperate because they are embarrassed by this they should be 
embarrassed by this 
nancy r kingsbury who is directing the study for the gao an 
investigative arm of congress said the agency has had disputes 
with the executive branch in the past over specific documents but 
it is unusual for the administration to refuse to answer any 
questions at all 
nicholas rostow legal adviser to the national security council 
said in a letter to ms kingsbury that the gao request raised 
important statutory and constitutional issues requiring 
analysis before the administration could reply 
the rostow letter was made public by rep bill alexander 
dark who requested the study along with sen john kerry dmass 
rostows letter was followed by one from state department 
comptroller roger b feldman saying the nsc counsel was acting as 
the administrations point of contact on this matter and adding 
all executive branch agencies have been instructed by the white 
house not to take any action on your request until various legal 
issues have been analyzed by the administration 
rostows office said he was not available to comment 
ms kingsbury said the study is part of a larger inquiry 
examining how information about drug trafficking by foreign 
officials has affected us foreign policy decisions 
noriega was indicted on drug trafficking charges earlier this 
year by two federal grand juries in florida the administration has 
sought without success to force noriega from power in panama since 
that time 
the gao is seeking information from the state department 
defense department drug enforcement administration and national 
security council

small agriculture operators who want a piece 
of the action in farm exports can get help from the agriculture 
departments foreign agricultural service the department says 
its a tricky game to compete with the corporate giants said 
dugger harris coordinator of the minority and small business 
program for fas 
the agency has a formal agreement with the small business 
administration to include small and minorityowned companies in 
usdas export market development programs 
most of the assistance offered under the programs is free or 
available at nominal costs harris said his office is providing 
services to about 250 companies and is looking for more 
we want small and minorityowned businesses to know that we 
will make available to them the same services the fas provides to 
large exporting businesses he said 
harris described the program in the forthcoming september issue 
of foreign agriculture magazine a monthly publication of the usda 
agency 
one of the best ways fas can help small businesses gain a 
foothold in exporting is through participation in international 
trade fairs and the business contacts that can be made through 
them he said 
there is a large demand for the limited exhibit space at trade 
fairs but harris said fas has reserved 10 percent of the us 
space for small and minorityowned businesses 
participation fees are covered by the agency and the small 
business administration for those small and minority companies that 
are selected to exhibit at the overseas fairs however the 
companies must bear the costs of travel lodging and other expenses 
a firm can qualify for consideration if it has an annual gross 
income of 5 million or less and not more than 25 fulltime 
employees 
jerry ravenell president of low country international inc of 
washington dc and mount pleasant sc was cited as an example 
of how the program works the company provides export services to 
small and mediumsize us companies ranging from crating and 
shipping to serving as overseas agents for us food products 
ravenell began four years ago working with fas and small 
business administration programs and now is gaining a reputation 
as a knowledgeable and experienced exporting enterprise the 
report said 
another example involves beef jerky made by the apache meat 
processing co apache okla owned by robert rowell a kiowa 
indian like ravenell rowell also exhibited at a 1984 food trade 
show in london his beef jerky attracted so much attention that 
rowell received an order from harrods the famous london 
department store 
for six months he supplied harrods with beef jerky made with a 
special patented sauce 
rowell even got a national minority business person of the year 
award from president reagan unfortunately rowells dream ran 
afoul of british suspicion of the water in oklahoma 
while my jerky met with us government health guidelines the 
english analyzed it and decided that oklahomas water which is 
used in making the jerky wasnt as pure as they would like 
rowell said 
but the report added that rowell is installing a water 
chlorinator at his processing plant and is hoping to get back into 
the british jerky market the japanese also are showing interest 
in our dried beef products he said 
the report said people interested in the usda program can 
contact dugger harris coordinator minority and small business

china has been given the goahead by the 
agriculture department to buy an additional 2 million metric tons 
of us wheat at subsidized prices 
acting undersecretary richard w goldberg said thursday the 
wheat will be sold to china at competitive world prices under the 
departments export enhancement program or eep 
under various authorizations or initiatives since jan 26 
1987 china has bought about 7 million tons of us wheat under the 
program the previous authorization was for 2 million tons on april 
5 of which only 10000 tons remain for use which is added to the 
latest authorization 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
under eep arrangements exporters can sell us commodities at 
reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition and then 
collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as 
bonuses or subsidies 
the soviet union also has been a big buyer of us wheat under 
eep with purchases totaling about 13 million tons since april 30 
1987

about 355 million bushels of surplus feed 
grains owned by the agriculture department have been set aside as a 
reserve to meet potential demand for emergency livestock use under

owned by the departments commodity credit corp and are being held 
in warehouses in 40 states the grains include 2504 million 
bushels of corn 797 million bushels of sorghum and 25 million 
bushels of barley 
myers said additional stocks of ccc feed grains can be made

housing authorities in boston on thursday investigated the 
deaths of five elderly people the homeless in tennessee sought 
shelter from the swelter and new york citys mayor decided water 
troughs make good horse sense 
things werent much better in other parts of the country as the 
nation sweats through one of the hottest summers on record but 
rain and lower temperatures helped a rural community in western 
pennsylvania save its water supply for now 
at fort bragg and pope air force base in north carolina the 
mercury climbed to 106 degrees thursday the highest reading in the 
steamy state raleigh tied its alltime high of july 23 1952 as 
the mercury climbed to 105 degrees the national weather service 
said 
also setting heat records for the date were charlotte nc 
where 101 degrees broke a 1956 record of 99 and lynchburg va 
where 98 broke a 97degree mark set in 1914 
but a front stretching central iowa across the ohio valley and 
into the appalachians brought relief and thunderstorms to many 
cities north of it with temperatures in the 70s 
a 75yearold boston woman died of heart failure monday 
bringing to five the number of residents at a housing project who 
have died during 10 days of high temperatures four of the 
residents lived on the same floor 
the woman earlier became ill in her room on the top floor of the 
eightstory building three other topfloor residents and a man who 
lived on the floor below have died since aug 4 a period in which 
temperatures soared into the 90s 
its quite obvious someone has to look at it and see why that 
floor must have been so hot said massachusetts medical examiner 
bryan blackbourne 
boston housing authority officials thursday found all systems 
functional at the 18yearold building said spokesman bill wright 
the 12 exhaust fans on the roof were working and temperatures in 
the halls on each floor were only a few degrees apart he said 
the heat in kentucky where it reached 103 degrees in paducah 
breaking the 1954 mark of 102 forced some school systems to put 
off the start of classes 
i think the heat index measuring the combined effects of heat 
and humidity is hotter than i can ever remember it said darvin 
estes school superintendent in bath county where opening day was 
postponed from wednesday to monday 
southern illinois also remained in the heat waves grip as the 
northern part of the state got relief from a cold front that 
brought thunderstorms and hail by 2 pm peoria reported the 
mercury had soared to 101 degrees in contrast chicago had a 
relatively mild 85 degrees 
two homeless shelters in nashville tenn where temperatures 
hovered around 100 degrees all week stayed open all day to provide 
a cool spot 
its a terrible problem theres really nowhere for these 
people to go said winnie mckenzie director of st patricks 
shelter ive been keeping our people in during the day i cant 
put them out with babies and all 
the nashville union rescue mission also opened its 
airconditioned chapel during the day 
in new york city the collapse earlier this week of a carriage 
horse working in 90degreeplus weather created a public furor and 
prompted mayor edward i koch to announce some changes 
koch said thursday the city will provide more watering holes in 
central park move a horse ambulance there and provide shade in hot 
weather he also called for review of a regulation that requires 
horses to return to the stable when the temperature hits 90 degrees 
the changes he said make good oldfashioned horse sense 
rain and lower temperatures enabled tidioute pa to save its 
public water supply 
we dont know how long its going to last another hot day and 
well be right back where we were said karen bajorek borough 
secretary 
workers installed a pump to draw water from a well that was 
drilled in 1985 but left unused because of high concentrations of 
minerals including iron that leaves rustcolored stains and sodium 
that has been linked to high blood pressure 
so people on a nosalt diet will not be able to drink it and 
because of the high iron content it might stain their sinks and 
their clothes ms bajorek said 
despite the misery some people have come up with creative ways 
of beating the heat 
hm hines who owns home ice and coal co in raleigh said it 
was hot enough that some people had asked him to dump blocks of ice 
into their swimming pools 
but its not a good idea hines saidsomebody jumps in and 
hits that 300pound block of ice its dangerous

the younger brother of the sovietbacked 
leader of afghanistan has defected to the united states in a move 
that state department officials say could tarnish najibullahs 
image 
the afghan ruler and his brother saddiqullah rahi were said to 
have been at odds for years saddiqullah was under death threat and 
was protected for months by an antigovernment faction that then 
spirited him out of afghanistan to pakistan said two us 
officials who spoke thursday on condition of anonymity 
the two brothers sometimes go by shorter names najibullah is 
also known as najib and saddiqullah as saddiq 
saddiqullah 37 his wife soraya and their two young sons 
reached the united states on wednesday from frankfurt west 
germany and have been given sanctuary the officials said 
he was accepted in this country as a refugee an official 
told the associated press no special deals were made but the 
processing was expedited elaborate security precautions have been 
taken 
saddiqullah who was described as an intellectual apparently 
joined the forces of ahmed shah massoud the rebel field commander 
who has led the fight against afghan troops and soviet forces in 
the strategic panjshir valley 
he also was believed to have joined the jamiatiislami party 
one of the largest opposition groups 
some years ago a us official said saddiqullah served as 
afghanistans banking representative in hamburg west germany he 
broke with his brother and claimed he was kidnapped taken to east 
germany and forced back to afghanistan the official said 
it certainly doesnt do anything for the image of the leader 
of afghanistan for his brother who had a privileged position to 
defect the official said 
meanwhile the state department expressing satisfaction with 
the pace of the soviet troop pullout from afghanistan urged moscow 
on thursday to withdraw all remaining soldiers by years end six 
weeks before the deadline set by the geneva accords 
we see no reason why the soviets cannot meet their 
oftenstated goal of completing the withdrawal by the end of 1988 
nine years to the month from their invasion the department said 
in a statement 
the soviet withdrawal is indispensable to the ability of the 
afghan people to determine their own future and of the afghan 
refugees to return home in safety and honor it said 
the geneva accords signed last april call for completing the 
soviet armys pullout by feb 15 half the troops were to have been 
removed by last monday a deadline the state department said the 
soviets met 
the vast majority of afghanistan is now free of soviet 
troops the statement said soviet combat units remain deployed 
in only two corridors in northern afghanistan the bulk of soviet 
troops remaining in that country are in the kabul area and along 
the road heading north from kabul to termez the soviet border 
town 
on wednesday after pakistani president mohammed zia ulhaq was 
killed in an air crash us and soviet diplomats held an 
unannounced meeting in washington zia had played a leading role in 
arranging the afghan troop withdrawal 
a us official who spoke only on condition that he not be 
identified said the soviets assured the americans that zias death 
would not affect the withdrawal

texas air corp has accused american and 
united airlines of gaining hundreds of millions of dollars through 
illegal use of their reservations systems 
texas air the nations largest airline group charged in a 
complaint filed thursday with the department of transportation that 
united and american were deliberately misleading travel agents 
using their computerized reservations systems 
by giving agents unreliable information about rivals flights 
american and united have discouraged the agents from booking 
passengers on airlines other than theirs the complaint said 
this is the first time anyone has documented how american and 
united use the power of technology to pick the pockets of 
consumers said bill diffenderffer vice president and general 
counsel of system one which runs texas airs computerized 
reservations system 
the complaint was made in the names of system one and texas 
airs two main carriers continental and eastern 
american and united both denied the charges saying past 
attempts by texas air to challenge the legality of their 
computerized reservations systems had failed 
this effort by texas air is unworthy of serious attention 
said charles novak a united spokesman in chicago he said texas 
air had been unsuccessful in past lawsuits against the united 
computerized reservations system 
novak accused texas air of trying to use the courts the 
congress and federal agencies to gain for itself business that 
united has secured through hard work large investments and 
innovation 
jim brown an american spokesman said texas airs charges were 
without foundation 
the inchthick texas air complaint said uniteds computerized 
reservations system called apollo and americans known as sabre 
are supposed to allow travel agents to make seat reservations and 
issue boarding passes reliably for flights on other airlines 
instead sabre and apollo are designed deliberately not to 
provide consistently reliable information about other carriers the 
texas air complaint said because of the unreliability travel 
agents are discouraged from booking flights on airlines other than 
american and united texas air contended 
the houstonbased texas air claimed united and american had 
violated section 411 of the federal aviation act which prohibits 
unfair or deceptive methods of airline competition 
the complaint includes a copy of what texas air called an 
internal american memo dated july 15 1980 expressing concern that 
uniteds sabre system might be giving united an edge 
the memo says that if american can determine that uniteds 
computerized system gives it greater market preferences than 
does americans system either through conscious bias or by 
making it inconvenient to book carriers other than united we must 
find a way to skew the usage rates of sabre in similar ways 
the complaint also accused united and american of preventing 
travel agents from obtaining competing computerized reservations 
systems such as texas airs system one 
texas air contends in a 20city survey included in the complaint 
that americans system diverted to american 71 million in 
additional passenger revenue from flights serving los angeles in 
may 1988 similarly united diverted 87 million on the same 
routes in that period the complaint alleges 
it said such diversions had totaled hundreds of millions of 
dollars in recent years but it gave no exact figures

satisfaction he told rolling stone i thought it was just 
filler 
richards said he wrote the guitar line in a motel in clearwater 
fla during the bands us tour in 1965 
like a rolling stone is dylans only recording in the top 
100 though his all along the watchtower ranked 65th in the 
version recorded by jimi hendrix and mr tambourine man 
covered by the byrds was no 86 
like a rolling stone broke through the threeminute format 
of most 45s and set the rock world on the road to freeform fm 
unlike richards dylan never suffered doubts about the quality 
of his song the first two lines which rhymed kiddin you with 
didnt you just about knocked me out and later on when i got to 
the jugglers and the chrome horse and the princess on the steeple 
it all just about got to be too much he said in a statement 
given to the magazine 
the beatles also appear at no 29 with hey jude no 48 with 
strawberry fields forever backed by penny lane and at no 
53 with help john lennons imagine is no 44 and his 
instant karma no 79 
the magazine which celebrated its 20th anniversary last year 
said it could easily have compiled a list of 100 great 45 rpm 
recordings from the 1950s however it chose to go back to 1963 as 
a time of revitalization and reinvention in rock n roll 
the highestrated song from 1963 is louie louie the 
unintelligble garagerock hit by the kingsmen of portland ore 
other 1963 hits are da doo ron ron by the crystals no 35 and 
be my baby by the ronettes no 38 both produced by phil 
spector

recent song in the rolling stone top 10 
the 25 rock critics including rolling stone editor and 
publisher jann wenner paid little homage to the king of rock n 
roll elvis presley putting his suspicious minds at no 47

republican delegates fretted thursday over 
dan quayles decision to join the national guard when the vietnam 
war was raging but many shrugged it off and some groused about a 
news media witch hunt 
several said they would have done the same themselves had they 
been eligible for the military draft during the conflict national 
guard units were rarely activated for vietnam duty 
rep helen delich bentley of maryland said i dont like the 
sound of it she said quayle george bushs choice as a running 
mate had denied wednesday that anyone used influence to help him 
get into the guard in 1969 
bentley at first suggested that quayle had only two choices 
either admit he was a liar or he can withdraw from the race 
but later she backed off saying the issue was dead and had 
been based on inaccurate news reports 
rep bob dornan a staunch conservative and cochairman of the 
bush campaign in california said it requires a checkerslike 
speech and he must do must do it quickly before this gets out 
of hand 
george walker bush jr the vice presidents eldest son called 
the flap ridiculous and said he joined the national guard too 
in 1968 
it was available and i went said bush 42 who was a pilot 
in the guard i thought it was service to my country and im 
proud of my time in the national guard 
utah sen orrin hatch said if dan can withstand the next two 
weeks which will be brutal hell be vice president of the united 
states 
whats the big deal said sen gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire he pulled some strings to serve his country he could 
have gone to canada 
the questions through the state delegation meetings thursday 
morning hours before the climactic night of the republican 
national convention 
samuel atkins 43 a watkinsville ga lawyer said the baby 
boomers will understand but the older generation may hold it 
against him 
gordon pederson of wall sd a retired us army lieutenant 
colonel said i was in three wars and a riot and see nothing 
wrong with that it was just a legal option it just burns me 
up because somebody is looking for headlines 
sen john mccain of arizona a navy fighter pilot who spent 5 
years in a hanoi prison said service in the national guard is 
an honorable profession 
if however there is clear evidence that the process may have 
been manipulated to give some kind of special preference then i 
think its a problem that needs to be resolved he said 
tj bailey of bailey ore the state gop chairman and a 
vietnam veteran said i truly do not resent dan quayle for not 
having gone it is a way a number of my lifelong friends opted we 
have to examine the sanity and wisdom of people who resent him for 
not being shot at 
noble cody a businessman from cookeville tenn said if i 
had a son that age and knowing what i do now about that war id do 
everything i could to keep him out of it 
bob naylor the california state gop chairman and a vietnam 
veteran said quayle did what anyone in his position would do at 
that time 
delegate tom adam of pierre sd said i think thats just a 
witch hunt 
retired army maj gen jerry curry a congressional candidate 
from virginia beach va who served two tours in vietnam said 
the idea that anybody who serves in the national guard or 
reserves should be called a draft dodger because their unit did not 
get activated and sent off to war is disgusting 
sen ted stevens of alaska said quayle should get his uniform 
pictures and put them out everywhere its a plus not a negative 
alabama gov guy hunt said suggesting that joining the national 
guard was almost the same as going to canada made him the 
fightingest mad that ive been in a long time 
jerry prevo of anchorage chairman of the alaska delegation 
said people make mistakes when theyre young 
tom cole chairman of the oklahoma republican party called it 
quaylebashing i think its kind of a cheap shot and a low 
blow

a state supreme court ruling that limits 
the ability of unmarried people to sue for emotional distress when 
a livein companion is killed shows the court is out of touch with 
the times says a lawyer in the case 
we all know that in this society no one frowns on people who 
are not married living together said michael robins a lawyer 
for richard elden who filed suit over a fatal 1982 crash in 
pasadena 
its a new world and the supreme court just hasnt caught up 
with it robins said 
in a 61 decision thursday the court cited the states 
interest in promoting marriage in saying that elden who saw his 
lover fatally injured in a car crash cannot sue the other driver 
for emotional distress and loss of companinship 
the ruling prevents a member of an unmarried couple whether 
heterosexual or homosexual from suing for emotional distress 
suffered from seeing the other partner injured such suits can be 
filed by a spouse a parent a child or other close relative 
justice stanley mosk writing for the majority said allowing a 
suit by a lover would impose a difficult burden on the courts 
which would have to decide whether the relationship was stable 
and significant and contained the emotional attachments of the 
family relationship 
such an inquiry would also threaten a massive intrusion into 
the private life of the partners mosk said 
the court also said a suit for loss of consortium which 
refers to love companionship emotional support and sexual 
relations denied by loss of a partner can be filed only by a 
spouse 
in dissent justice allen broussard said there was no legal or 
social reason to prevent one member of a couple living together to 
sue for emotional damage caused by seeing the other partner injured 
such emotional injuries are to be expected given the 
widespread reality and acceptance of unmarried cohabitation 
broussard said 
the ruling did not affect a 1976 palimony decision involving 
actor lee marvin in which the court led the nation in establishing 
property rights of married couples by allowing one member of an 
unmarried couple to bind the other to an implied promise of 
financial support 
patrick mesisca a lawyer for robert sheldon the other driver 
in the case said allowing a suit by a member of an unmarried 
couple could have opened up a pandoras box of litigation that 
could include people of the same sex could include roommates 
could include people who have close personal friendships 
elden was injured in a december 1982 crash in pasadena that 
killed linda ebeling the woman he lived with his suit said 
sheldon had run a red light and hit their car broadside 
elden settled the suit over his personal injuries but his 
attempt to collect damages from sheldon for emotional distress and 
loss of consortium was dismissed by los angeles superior court 
judge george xanthos a state appeals court upheld that decision 
those rulings and thursdays supreme court decision rejected 
rulings by a few appellate courts allowing suits by one member of a 
couple who claimed a stable significant relationship 
equivalent to marriage

oil remains in good supply but fresh 
water is running low in the six arab nations on the persian gulf 
united nations experts are concerned 
the dammam aquifer running like an umbilical cord under the six 
nations provides an estimated onethird of their overall water 
but with all six states sucking up the water faster than nature can 
put it back the experts predict a future far more arid than it is 
now 
man can live without food for two to three months but he 
would die without water for two to three days said ahmed adel 
orabi deputy director of the regional un environmental program 
which is based in bahrain a gulf island 
if extraction continues to exceed recharge the dammam aquifer 
can dry up within 10 to 50 years he said if wellexploited 
it can last forever 
water resources are a problem throughout the middle east riots 
broke out in sudan in july over fluctuations in the water supply 
libya is expecting to invest 25 billion in an underground river 
system some analysts see a danger of wars in the future over the 
areas water resources 
the dammam aquifer stretches the length of the western coastline 
of the persian gulf from kuwait in the north through saudi arabia 
bahrain qatar the united arab emirates and oman 
the reservoir used mostly for agriculture is the source of the 
artesian wells that allowed oases to flourish along the coast for 
hundreds of years 
but oil wealth brought new demands on the water supply as 
economies expanded 
saudi arabia has a daily desalinized water flow of 588 million 
gallons for a population of less than 12 million with its vast oil 
reserves it can afford it 
but states like bahrain still have to rely on nature and 
officials here view the depletion of the dammam aquifer with alarm 
bahrain gets 50 percent of its water from the underground system 
water has been stored in the reservoir over millions of years 
over the past 10 to 15 years it is being bled more than can be 
compensated said jamil al alawi bahrains assistant 
undersecretary for power and water affairs 
bahrains finances battered by soft oil prices have enabled it 
to build only two desalinization plants a third a gift from saudi 
arabia has been delayed 
desalinization plants make it unlikely that anyone in the area 
will go thirsty but the cost of the refined water is prohibitive 
for farm irrigation this means that water from the aquifer could 
be the key to agricultural and economic development 
desalinization plants complement the reservoir they are good 
for drinking purposes but it is the reservoir that helps vital 
development going said orabi there can be no food security 
without water security 
area leaders call for nationwide prayers when the rains do not 
come in the winter while newspaper and television campaigns skewer 
careless users 
television programs remind bahrainis that only 50 years ago 
water used to be hauled in from the kawkabs the sweetwater 
springs gushing from the sea 
water is our most precious source of life when its gone so 
are we said another tv program 
this years rains have been bountiful so much so that tomato 
growers on bahrain nearly lost their crops 
but rains are unpredictable 
the un environmental program hopes to come up with a 
comprehensive plan within two years for conserving the damman 
aquifer and an international agreement might have to be worked out 
to distribute the water among the six nations 
the un plan will also suggest alternative irrigation sources 
such as recycling sewer water it also will seek to reeducate 
farmers on cutting the amount of water used on their fields 
orabi said it is a false concept that land in desert areas 
requires more water for irrigation 
alalawi estimated that bahrains population was growing at the 
rate of 5 percent to 10 percent annually and coupled with a rising 
standard of living water consumption reached a peak of 61 million 
gallons a day last year it is expected to hit 65 million this 
summer its desalinization plants produce a little over half that 
until greater production and conservation redress the situation 
bahrain would have to pump 30 million gallons a day from the dammam 
aquifer to meet demand 
bahrain sits at the edge of the aquifer and drawing too much 
water too fast could allow seawater to seep in alalawi said too 
much salinity in artesian wells is irreversible 
this year and the coming years the situation is critical 
but i wont call it dangerous he said

delegates of south korea and north korea 
met friday for the first time in more than 2 years to discuss 
easing their bitter 40year rivalry but they disagreed on the 
norths demand to be a cohost of the summer olympics 
the two sides adjourned without reaching any agreement after 
talking for almost three hours on the format and agenda for 
fullscale parliamentary talks they agreed to a second meeting 
saturday 
the talks between five lawmakers from each side opened with 
chief north korean delegate chon kum chol insisting the communist 
north act as cohost at the games and calling for a nonaggression 
pact between the two koreas 
the olympics he said were a serious political problem which 
will decide the destiny of the korean people 
chief south korean delegate park joonkyu in his opening 
speech said the only solution was for the north to take part in 
the olympics in seoul which begin sept 17 he made no reference 
to cohosting the games with north korea 
the only way for the two sides to cooperate with each other in 
the cause of the 24th olympiad is for your athletes to take part in 
the seoul games together with our athletes he told north korean 
delegates 
the north is demanding to cohost the olympics to stave off what 
might be viewed as a major political defeat both sides claim to be 
the sole legitimate government of korea and the south sees its 
selection to host the olympics as international recognition of its 
claim 
park said the south would keep the door open until the last 
moment for the north to take part but he noted that the deadline 
for entries was sept 2 
how regretful it would be if our nation already suffering 
from the division of the homeland must see even the olympics cause 
a split between seoul and pyongyang he said 
north korea has said it will boycott the olympics if it is not 
allowed to cohost the games 
the international olympic committee has said repeatedly north 
korean cannot cohost because the games are awarded to a single 
city south korean authorities fear the north may use terrorism to 
try to disrupt the olympics 
the two koreas technically still at war are archenemies with 
hundreds of thousands of troops poised along the 150mile border in 
a state of constant tension 
the two sides have no relations the border is sealed and the 
two countries maintain no direct transportation or communications 
links except for a single hotline 
the korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by soviet and us 
forces that ended the japanese occupation at the end of world war 
ii separate republics were declared in 1948 north korea invaded 
the south in 1950 beginning the korean war that ended in stalemate 
three years later 
the south has evolved into a major economic power and started to 
move toward full democracy the north has remained one of the most 
isolated and authoritarian nations in the world 
fridays meeting at the truce city in panmunjom represented the 
first meeting between the two sides since the last peace talks 
collapsed in january 1986 
all the north korean delegates at fridays sesssion were drawn 
from the official rubberstamp supreme peoples assembly the south 
korean delegation consisted of two government party members of the 
national assembly and a legislator from each of the three main 
opposition parties 
while stressing the importance of the olympics the north korean 
delegation placed it second on its list of priorities putting the 
need for a nonaggression pact first 
south korean observers said it could be a sign the north 
realized it could not cohost the olympics and was already looking 
beyond the games 
the two sides also remained far apart on the agenda for later 
fullscale talks north korea wants to discuss a nonaggression 
pact and the olympics the south said it wants much broader talks 
covering a range of social political and economic issues 
the north also continued to insist on participation of the full 
parliaments of both sides in addition to representatives of social 
and cultural groups 
south korea insisted on smaller delegations 
chon said the first fullscale meeting should be held aug 26 in 
the north korean capital of pyongyang he said any final agreement 
would be put to a vote of the two assemblies

shifting wind abruptly fanned a weekold 
fire in the mountains on the outskirts of helena quadrupling the 
blaze to 20000 acres burning 10 houses and cabins and forcing 
dozens of residents to flee authorities said thursday 
when i saw that that wall of flame all i wanted to do was get 
out said carol williams one of at least 55 people ordered from 
their homes late wednesday night in a mountain area 15 miles south 
of helena 
authorities had warned an additional 400 to 500 people in the 
nearby saddle mountain subdivision where large wooded lots are 
several hundred yards from each other they might have to evacuate 
but thursdays winds turned the flames away from the area said art 
howell of the interagency fire dispatch center 
about 40 people living in the elkhorn mountains south of here 
remained out of their homes thursday afternoon 
the warm springs blaze began when a fourwheeldrive vehicle 
caught fire aug 9 wind changed the fires dirction wednesday 
evening from the east to the north and flames quickly burned a 
3milewide swath fire officials said four houses and six summer 
cabins were burned said fire information officer bob krepps 
the fire grew to 17000 acres by thursday morning up from about 
5000 acres the day before by thursday afternoon it was estimated 
at 20000 acres officials had no estimate of when the fire might 
be contained 
the fire burned heavily all through the night said anne 
jeffery a fire information officer 
you could hear the fire coming said barbara duffy whose 
cabin and herd of 30 cows were destroyed by flames 
it sounded like a train she said then when we came out 
of the garage we saw this fireball coming at us through the trees 
it was the strangest feeling 
gov ted schwinden flew in a helicopter over the fire and said 
he feared it would get worse the wind has come up the humidity 
is down the temperature is up and we still have a serious fire 
situation he said 
elsewhere in montana firefighters battled blazes covering more 
than 15000 acres while fires also continued at yellowstone park 
in wyoming and other parts of the west

even as he became the republican vice 
presidential nominee thursday dan quayle was mired in controversy 
after it was disclosed that a family connection helped him join the 
national guard at the height of the vietnam war 
top aides to presidential nominee george bush met during the day 
to discuss ways to quell the furor as campaign spokeswoman alixe 
glen declared not a single thought is being given to changing 
the ticket 
criticism heard outside the superdome was weighed against 
delegates enthusiastic demonstrations inside the hall quayle 
added several lines to his acceptance speech to make his defiant 
stand clear and the crowd erupted in applause 
as a young man i served six years in the national guard and 
like the millions of americans who have served in the guardi am 
proud of it quayle said 
im proud to have dan quayle at my side bush told the 
delegates as he accepted the top spot on the ticket 
what should have been a triumphant day for the secondterm 
indiana senator was instead full of hurried meetings and wild 
rumors as the story of his military service unfolded 
some republicans suggested quayles nomination might have been a 
mistake 
i dont like the fact that quayle denied yesterday that 
anybody had interceded on his behalf when apparently someone had 
said rep helen bentley chairman of the bush campaign in maryland 
quayle can do one of two things admit this and that he was a 
liar or he can withdraw from the race 
she backed off later however saying the issue was dead and 
based on inaccurate news reports 
rep tom tauke of iowa voiced similar views if appropriate 
information was sought and appropriate information wasnt 
forthcoming then if i were george bush id reserve the right to 
reconsider 
quayle refused to answer questions about the uproar 
i answered many questions last night quayle told reporters 
as he entered the convention hall im going to continue to 
answer questions you raise about me about issues about anything 
through this campaign 
tonight is george bushs night and in deference to george 
bush im not going to get into all the details ill be around 
tomorrow ill be around the next day to answer your questions 
he added 
bush aides met during the day to hash out the campaigns 
reaction to the controversy 
we have chased down every single rumor we havent been able 
to substantiate one single rumor bush press secretary sheila 
tate said after a threehour afternoon meeting 
asked if the campaign thought the matter had been put to rest 
tate said i believe so 
others agreed 
its ridiculous to talk of dropping him from the ticket over 
something like this said kansas gov mike hayden a vietnam 
veteran i know a lot of people whose families made calls to get 
them into the guard or the military dan quayle volunteered 
the indiana senator said wednesday that he didnt know whether 
family connections had been used to get him into the national guard 
and that suggestions that he joined to avoid the draft were a 
cheap shot a day later he said through a spokesman that calls 
may have been made 
the indianapolis news a newspaper owned by quayles family 
reported thursday that its former managing editor wendell c 
phillippi had interceded with guard officials on quayles behalf 
phillippi was a former commander of the indiana national guard and 
worked for quayles grandfather at the newspaper later phillippi 
said he made only one call on quayles behalf 
i did recommend danny quayle for the national guard 
phillippi said i just called the military department and said 
heres a good man you ought to take him it was just as i 
have done for many young men over many years i was just a peon 
calling the military department i had no power 
there was some disagreement over whether there were long waiting 
lists to get into the national guard in indiana as in other 
states 
john s anderson adjutant general prior to 1969 said one did 
exist but john n owens who followed anderson in the job said 
indiana units had vacancies galore 
quayle a hardliner on defense matters joined the national 
guard in 1969 when he had graduated from college and thus lost his 
student deferment from the draft quayle was a private first class 
in the guard serving as a writer in a public information unit 
until 1975 
few guard units were activated and sent to vietnam and many 
young men sought to join the guard to avoid being drafted and sent 
to vietnam of the more than 58000 american casualties in the 
vietnam war 97 were guardsmen in mobilized units 
phillippi said quayle inquired as to whether he might be sent to 
vietnam as part of a guard unit 
the issue of how he got into the guard was raised during the 
screening process run by the bush campaign on all possible running 
mates said bush aide robert teeter 
the question was i believe was there any pull or some 
influence in some way for him to get into the national guard my 
impression is the answer is absolutely not said teeter he at 
some point said i simply applied like anyone else said 
teeter 
while the bush campaign tried to play down the controversy 
other republicans said it could be a continuing problem for the gop 
ticket 
lets face it the question is whether a rich kids family got 
him into the guard when other people were getting drafted said 
john decamp a vietnam veteran and republican delegate some of 
them like me got shot at a lot and a great many of them just plain 
got shot and killed 
ed rollins former campaign manager for ronald reagan said if 
quayle misled the campaign bush would have a right to withdraw 
the nomination you cut your losses and do not bleed to death 
sen alan simpson of wyoming said questions about quayles 
military service were a bunch of crap there are about 10 million 
people in the national guard who should be offended by all of 
this 
but rep bob dornan of california a hardline conservative and 
longtime bush supporter said quayle must explain himself much as 
richard nixon did in 1952 to defuse reports of financial 
impropriety 
it requires a checkerslike speech and he must do it must 
do it quickly before this gets out of hand dornan said

elaborate bonding rituals tribal chants 
ceremonial plumage a center spread in last months national 
geographic 
no its an anthropologistseye view of the republican national 
convention 
in other societies you usually just get together and kill a 
lot of pigs says martha ward a professor at the university of 
new orleans 
in america men in dark suits and women in red white and blue 
dresses travel long distances to attend meetings discuss issues 
and give speeches 
but wait 
people also stage feasts wear costumes and extoll their 
virtues be they cooperation loyalty defense aggression or 
careful spending habits and they do this all over the world in 
the pacific in africa in the united states 
the convention was classic anthropological drama says ward 
who viewed the spectacle on tv she watched swaying figures in 
funny hats and saw elaborately costumed primitive dancers she 
listened to delegates shout usa usa and heard echoes of 
ancient tribal chants 
rituals of this kind transcend ordinary bureaucratic 
actions she says we could get together and just nominate the 
guy its been done already anyhow but its important to have 
rituals of connection ceremonies achieve many purposes and most 
of what happens is very predictable 
gerald fords presence ancestorworship says ward they 
have to pay homage to ancestors they may rehabilitate one every 
now and then and drag out his bones jimmy carter got rehabbed for 
the democrats gerald ford was brought out by the republicans 
stressing connections to the past serves a purpose it gives 
us a chance to discuss our values to say these values are still 
important theyve seen us through tough times in the past and 
theyre good values for the future 
opening and closing prayers theres always a mild 
supernatural element of worship regardless of whether it offends 
is constitutional or sectarian its going to be there its very 
important that god bless the endeavor that you make it known hes 
on your side 
campaign hats and buttons are just so many tribal tattoos 
when youre in a transitional period or celebrating something 
its customary to alter your appearance we do it for weddings for 
funerals for graduations similar costumes reinforce unity 
they want these people to move as a group 
the daily communal breakfasts lunches and dinners are integral 
to the proceedings nothing happens in human society without 
food 
while most convention speeches contain little besides rhetoric 
the speakers choice of imagery can speak volumes ward says this 
year brought less sports and battle imagery and more feminine 
themes home and hearth 
every person talked about their families and paraded them out 
at great length 
there was no shortage of tough talk directed at democrats 
however ward calls that chestbeating its lockerroom stuff 
theyre patting these delegates on the rear end and sending them 
out there to win its very contagious what happens in groups you 
cant do this to yourself at home 
what happened this week in new orleans has nothing to do with 
survival with eating or sleeping or feeding your kids or even 
with whether the country runs or not it was pageantry plain and 
simple its a colossal game thats why its held in the 
superdome 
if the convention was a winner the rituals will work their 
magic 
people will go home feeling involved and committed says 
ward theyll work hard for their leaders best of all theyll 
contribute money labor pigs seashells

dan quayles vice presidential nomination was 
supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young indiana senator 
but the dream faded overnight 
bushs surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to 
ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of 
inspiration but he quickly encountered questions over his military 
record and suggestions he could best serve the republicans by 
withdrawing from the ticket 
though he found himself in danger of fizzling thursday quayle 
managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about 
family generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a bush 
administration 
lets go on to victory quayle exhorted as the crowd 
erupted in cheers 
the 41yearold nominee delivered the speech with calm 
selfassurance sticking close to his text and avoiding his 
penchant for extemporaneous remarks perhaps another result of the 
unanticipated controversy 
bush who followed his running mate to the podium said he was 
proud to have dan quayle at my side the two will stress the 
unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend 
through indiana ohio and illinois 
but beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent 
that threatened quayles candidacy just as it was launched 
retired maj gen wendell c phillippi who worked for quayles 
grandfather eugene c pulliam as managing editor of the 
indianapolis news said he contacted the national guard on behalf 
of quayle when the young man applied in 1969 and recommended him 
very highly the news reported 
quayle a hardliner on defense matters has said he sought guard 
duty so he could attend law school a bush aide said the matter was 
discussed with the indiana senator during the process that led to 
his selection for the bush ticket and quayle had denied that he 
used influence to gain admittance to the guard 
bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping quayle 
from the ticket as some republicans suggested quayle was tense 
and refused to answer reporters questions about the topic during a 
brief walkthrough at the convention hall 
it was a daunting change for the senator whose youthful vigor 
rapid political rise striking good looks and wealth have been 
compared to those of john f kennedy 
quayle alluded to the national guard issue during his speech 
saying he was proud of the six years he served he also addressed 
his relative anonymity many this week have asked who is dan 
quayle the people of indiana know me and now the nation will 
those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out 
their ammunition sen bob dole of kansas who placed quayles name 
in nomination stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect 
concerns that he lacked experience for the job 
hes already spent 12 years as a congressman and senator 
that is 12 more years of national experience than michael dukakis 
and he is running for president dole said 
sen alan simpson of wyoming one of those who seconded the 
nomination said quayle would bring vim vigor and vitality to 
the party and would bring sparks and voltage to this campaign 
whether quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national 
ticket remains to be seen others notably democratic vice 
presidential nominee geraldine ferraro in 1984 found they could 
not 
but quayle ever upbeat was determined thursday night not to be 
daunted by the prospect miracles do happen he told his party

presidential nominees probably would prefer 
to run without having to share the ticket running mates can be 
such a burden sometimes 
george bushs day of acceptance dulled by the questions that 
surfaced about how sen dan quayle joined the national guard in 
1969 is only the latest problem to attach to a partys ticket 
but usually it takes a little longer 
after gen dwight d eisenhower chose young california senator 
richard nixon to run with him in 1952 the campaign was roiled by 
reports that a slush fund had been set up for him in california 
as the issue festered it seemed eisenhower would drop his 
running mate but nixon regained public support with a broadcast 
speech in which he denied the implications he said everything he 
owned could be stripped from his family except their dog 
checkers the address became known as the checkers speech 
it was nixons turn next to be embarrassed by his running mate 
in 1968 after choosing little known maryland gov spiro agnew the 
campaign was rocked by agnews greeting a reporter on the campaign 
as a fat jap 
agnew insisted that he had meant no offense to the reporter 
with whom he had been friends and the issue went away 
in 1972 the democratic convention chose sen george mcgovern of 
south dakota to run for president and sen thomas eagleton of 
missouri to share the ticket 
ten days later eagleton disclosed he had voluntarily entered 
hospitals three times between 1960 and 1966 for nervous 
exhaustion and fatigue although he supported eagleton after the 
disclosure mcgovern cooled on his running mate and the missouri 
senator withdrew the first time a major party candidate left a 
national ticket after a convention 
in 1984 democrat walter mondale announced his choice of rep 
geraldine ferraro of new york in the week before the convention 
she won nomination by acclamation but immediately questions 
were raised about the finances of her husband john zaccaro a real 
estate investor and about her financial disclosure forms filed 
with the congress 
to quiet the storm she released reams of financial documents 
and held a news conference in new york that allayed most questions 
but the affair distracted the democratic campaigners from issues 
they wanted to emphasize

it was the republicans richest fundraiser 
of the year and all the big names were there the bushes the 
quayles the doles jack kemp and a fistful of senators muhammad 
ali rosie grier leo nadeau 
leo nadeau 
youre wondering who the hell is leo nadeau the 
silverhaired man told 4500 mystified guests at the new orleans 
convention center most of whom paid 1000 to rub shoulders 
thursday with brighter luminaries 
the answer he was george bushs tailgunner 45 years ago when 
bush was a navy bomber pilot during world war ii and of all the 
speakers who paid bush tribute nadeau is the only one the vice 
president thanked with a hug 
we were just a couple of kids nadeau told the crowd as he 
introduced his old war buddy but we became men overnight 
they shared the stage thursday under more pleasant 
circumstances helping raise roughly 43 million for the 
republican national committees operating budget that was twice 
what the rnc collected at its 1984 convention gala 
the take amounted to the rncs best ever for a 1000perplate 
affair though the committee pulled in 58 million at a 
higherpriced dinnerdance in 1984 said spokeswoman katherine 
murray 
this event was done up in style staged on a road to victory 
theme with a strip of black carpet leading from a huge mockup of a 
riverboat to a huge mockup of the white house the wine bottles 
bore rnc gala labels the menu included chicken breasts with gop

bush and his running mate sen dan quayle of indiana arrived 
with their wives in an antique fire engine led by a marching band 
looking on were sen bob dole of kansas and rep kemp of new york 
who both ran against bush and lost 
and the real heavyweights former boxing champion ali who 
shared a table with sen orrin hatch of utah and former 
professional football player grier now a preacher grier gave the

said when you tell us to sit well sit 
they paid to in addition to the private and corporate donors 
who shelled out 1000 each nine companies underwrote the party 
with 100000 donations 
bush rewarded the crowd with a preview of his acceptance speech 
he also stressed his loyalty to quayle who was embroiled in a 
controversy over whether he used family connections to join the 
national guard and avoid the vietnam draft in 1969 
for his part nadeau spoke of his and bushs wartime experience 
there are millions of americans like me men and women whove 
seen the face of war he said when we elect our next 
commanderinchief we will have made sure he is someone who has 
the courage and experience we can depend on for our lives and our 
livelihoods 
bush took up the theme leo nadeau talked about a mission that 
he and i shared we had a mission we knew what we had to do 
and now i stand here as one of two people who will be president 
of the united states of america and i know that ive got a

theres nothing to this said a george 
bush campaign aide engaging in a classic exercise in political 
damage control to quell the controversy over republican vice 
presidential nominee dan quayles military service 
we have chased down every single rumor we havent been able 
to substantiate one single rumor bush press secretary sheila 
tate said thursday after a threehour afternoon meeting 
bush political aides were plunged into a wearying scramble by 
the unanticipated questions raised about the indiana senator 
questions that threatened to rob the campaign of the boost they 
counted on getting from their national convention 
they briefed the chairmen of state delegations to calm their 
concerns and to assure them the whole matter had been overblown 
during a series of meetings beginning wednesday night and 
continuing through thursday top bush aides confronted the fact 
that the quayle flap also was endangering their careful plans for a 
closing convention session that would have bush firmly in the 
spotlight as the new leader of the republican party 
they discussed issuing a detailed statement citing chapter and 
verse of how quayle entered the indiana national guard in 1969 
when many draftees were being sent to vietnam according to one 
campaign aide who insisted on anonymity 
among the questions raised was whether quayle a member of an 
influential publishing family had sought and received special 
treatment 
but the idea of issuing a statement was dropped because it was 
felt it would detract from bushs acceptance speech 
for the same reason a quayle news conference was vetoed 
its the vice presidents night why should sen quayle hold 
some big news conference said tate 
when he arrived at the hall quayle refused to discuss the 
matter with reporters 
but the controversy could not be ignored 
influential republicans were uneasy with the matter and 
demanding answers 
i dont like the fact that quayle denied yesterday that 
anybody had interceded on his behalf when apparently someone had 
said rep helen bentley chairman of the bush campaign in maryland 
quayle can do one of two things admit this and that he was a 
liar or he can withdraw from the race 
later she backed away from her comment claiming she had been 
responding to inaccurate news reports 
rep tom tauke of iowa said he was concerned that quayle may 
have misled bush campaign officials when they asked about his 
military service 
if appropriate information was sought and appropriate 
information wasnt forthcoming then if i were george bush id 
reserve the right to reconsider tauke said 
bush aides moved swiftly to generate a swell of comment 
downplaying the significance of the allegations 
campaign chairman james a baker iii went on cable news network 
to say theres no substantiation a lot of rumors no 
substantiation 
were in the midst of a national convention where youre 
going to get a whole lot of rumors swirling popping up every 
hour baker said but they pop up nothings produced and they 
die there hasnt been one thing if youve got something id like 
to hear about it 
during the closing convention session a document was circulated 
on the floor that cited news accounts quoting indiana national 
guard officials as saying that no one needed special influence to 
join in 1969 
we would take anyone we could get was a quote from former 
indiana adjutant general john n owens 
a second sheet that circulated was labeled fact sheet use of 
national guard 
when dan quayle joined the army national guard guard units 
were being called up and sent to vietnam said the material 
compiled by the national guard bureau 
republican party chairman frank j fahrenkopf jr echoed that 
view and also took another common approach suggesting that somehow 
the accounts were an insult to the national guard 
fahrenkopf said the debate over quayles service seemed based on 
the idea that somehow its not honorable to be in the guard or 
navy or army reserves and thats ridiculous 
one of the most effective parts of the damage control strategy 
was to have quayle refer to his service in his speech accepting the 
vice presidential nomination 
as a young man i served six years in the national guard and 
like millions of americans who have served in the guard and who 
serve today and i am proud of that he said to cheers

republican strategists urged sensitivity 
toward hispanic voters and party heavyweights spent much of their 
convention courting a group that could spell the difference in such 
key states as texas and california 
the week opened with muted grumbling from some minority groups 
about being excluded from the party but that didnt extend to 
hispanics where party leaders said the environment is changing 
and the gop must react 
whether it is welcome or unwelcome the fact is the key 
political factor in the southwest is going to be the hispanic vote 
before the turn of the century said arizona sen john mccain 
our republican party is learning that if were going to 
prevail if were going to play a major role in politics in the 
southwest we must have good hispanic candidates mccain told a 
group of hispanic teenagers thursday 
the 265 young people many of them yet too young to vote were 
brought to the convention from across the country for a lesson in 
nontextbook politics they heard speeches from various senators 
and members of the family of presidential nominee george bush 
we are teaching them about politics about the political 
process said sandy estrada a dallasbased political consultant 
when they come to conventions theyre not going to be 
intimidated 
both parties are targeting the hispanic vote in this election 
with texas looming large because of its significant hispanic 
population 
bush claims texas as his home while democratic nominee michael 
dukakis picked texas sen lloyd bentsen as his running mate 
there is little hard evidence of any progress by either party a 
cbs news poll last month showed twothirds of the blacks and 
hispanics polled backed dukakis mccain noted that president reagan 
got about 45 percent of the hispanic vote in his 1984 victory but 
conceded that figure is skewed because of his heavy support among 
cubans 
mccain conceded the gop has work to do before it can lure big 
numbers of hispanics 
why have the republicans not done as well as they should have 
done with the hispanic vote mccain said very frankly a lot 
of it has to do with concern and interest and sensitivity to issues 
that affect the hispanic community

if youre planning on watching the today 
show anytime soon dont expect to see cohost bryant gumbel 
interviewing david letterman or cher or james earl jones or 
garrison keillor or 
meeting celebrities has never been something that thrills me 
i cant believe what expletive some socalled stars can be 
gumbel says in an interview in the sept 5 issue of us magazine 
gumbel holds a grudge against letterman stemming from a 1984 
prank when the late night with david letterman host interrupted 
a today show taping by using a bullhorn to proclaim he was nbc 
boss grant tinker and not wearing any pants 
i still think hes an expletive and many people interviewed 
by him think so too he never apologized and i have nothing to say 
to him gumbel said before ripping into other performers 
on cher i have an aversion to professional celebrities who 
appear on the cover of people every six months and who run out 
and do every little cheap gym ad 
on james earl jones when an interview with him is going 
badly i feel no compulsion to make him look better 
on garrison keillor a real jerk the worst

an estimated 4000 former westinghouse 
electric corp employees denied severance pay because of their age 
could share 35 million in what is believed to be the largest 
settlement of a discrimination case 
we broke some new ground charles shanor general counsel of 
the equal employment opportunity commission said thursday 
eeocs negotiators were armed with a federal court ruling that 
westinghouse violated the age discrimination in employment act when 
it denied severance pay to employees who were eligible for pensions 
after their jobs were eliminated in plant closings that began in 
1980 
the eeoc sued westinghouse in new jersey and pennsylvania in the 
early 1980s the pennsylvania suit was expanded in 1984 to include 
westinghouse employees nationwide except those represented in the 
new jersey suit 
a federal judge in new jersey dismissed that suit and the eeoc 
appealed to the us 3rd circuit court of appeals in philadelphia 
in the pennsylvania suit however a federal district judge ruled 
in the agencys favor and westinghouse appealed that decision to 
the 3rd circuit 
the district court heldthat forcing a pensioneligible 
employee to choose between the pension and severance is unlawful 
shanor said in a telephone interview from washington 
the resolution of the suits if approved in federal court will 
probably be the largest cash settlement ever in a discrimination 
case if it is approved in federal court shanor said 
westinghouse believes 4000 former employees who were primarily 
bluecollar production workers should share the 35 million an 
estimate the eeoc will check 
if our checkingreveals a disparity then the settlement is 
off shanor said 
westinghouse said it agreed to deposit the money in escrow for 
distribution after various conditions are met 
first the 3rd circuit court must agree to suspend ruling on the 
case until a us district court in philadelphia rules on the 
fairness of the settlement the lower court is expected to convene 
a hearing where the former employees can comment said eeoc 
spokeswoman margaret fernandez 
other contingencies include an agreement between the company and 
the agency that a layoff policy being proposed by westinghouse is 
lawful she said 
among other large discrimination suit settlements pan am corp 
agreed earlier this year to pay 172 million and offer training to 
pilots it had barred from continuing to work as flight engineers 
once they reached age 60 mrs fernandez said 
shanor said he knew of at least two similar pending cases 
against other companies which he declined to identify

dan quayle spent his six years in the 
indiana national guard as a clerktypist in the 120th public 
information detachment helping to turn out a quarterly magazine 
the indiana national guardsman 
it wasnt difficult duty recalled one member of the 12member 
unit 
the magazine had a lot of mushy little feature stories in it 
that didnt require too much effort said james g newland jr a 
reporter for the indianapolis star 
we had some free time and it wasnt odd for us to drink some 
beer and play cards during an extended lunch break or after 
drill newland told the star we never failed to have a good 
time 
another member of the unit sam r graves iii former superviser 
of the detachment said quayle was patriotic promilitary and not 
a draftdodger 
politically we are at opposite ends of the scale said 
graves but when i think of him words like integrity come to 
mind enthusiasm patriotism 
quayle was nominated thursday night as the republican candidate 
for vice president and his membership in the guard has come under 
scrutiny following the disclosure that he may have used pull to get 
in at a time when his contemporaries were being drafted and sent to 
vietnam 
in washington pentagon records showed that service in the 
national guard was not likely to lead to duty in vietnam 
some 34 million servicemen and women were sent to southeast 
asia during the vietnam war only about 9000 were in mobilized 
army and air national guard units 
by the time the fighting ended there had been more than 58000 
american casualties of which 97 were guardsmen 
quayle had worked from 1965 to 1969 at his familys newspaper 
the huntington heraldpress while studying political science at 
depauw university in greencastle 
he joined the guard in may 1969 after his student deferment 
expired he started out as a clerktypist 
in 1973 quayle was reclassified as a journalist helping other 
members of the 120th produce the awardwinning magazine 
quayle met with the group at least one weekend a month and for 
15 days of active duty during the summer 
i do recall that on one occasion when he was there we had a 
hell of a good time said james a gillaspy another former 
member and now a reporter with the indianapolis star he did his 
job like the rest of us and when the job was done he partied like 
the rest of us 
graves objected to accounts that he said portrayed the group as 
composed of slackers 
it made the outfit look like all we did was sit around and 
drink beer and the kind of outfit in which you had to have 
connections to get in he said there were times when we were 
frenetic and other times when we had down time but that doesnt 
mean we were sitting around drinking all the time 
the same year he became a guard journalist quayle was attending 
law school in indianapolis and working at a fulltime job in the 
state government graves said he and others occasionally missed 
their guard obligations but would make up for the absences later 
in all those years in which i knew him i was never once led 
to believe that his family was moneyed or that he had any influence 
to peddle graves said he always did whatever he was told 
always with a certain amount of enthusiasm he never quibbled 
on thursday retired guard maj gen wendell c phillippi who 
was managing editor of the indianapolis news and worked for 
quayles grandfather publisher eugene c pulliam said he made a 
phone call to help quayle gain entry into the guard 
phillippi said quayle asked him whether guard units in indiana 
were likely to be sent to vietnam 
but capt cathi kiger a spokeswoman for the indiana guard said 
that across the board we were under strength so there were some 
openings in the state 
she said records show the guards authorized strength on july 
31 1969 was 10378 but that only 10218 positions were filled 
its anything but a cushy job said photographer bob jordan 
another former member of the group i think a lot of people 
thought it was 
you tried to promote the national guard and get as much ink 
like any other public relations outfit you would try to promote 
your own outfit in that case the indiana national guard 
quayle enlisted as a private e1 the lowest possible rank and 
rose to specialist 5

moments after the last bush 88 chant 
echoed through the cavernous superdome and the last red white and

began 
republican national convention delegates helped start the 
process late thursday by collecting home state signs and scavenging 
we love george and bushquayle placards as souvenirs 
standing at the ready beneath one of the network television 
booths 10 workers equipped with brooms and shovels waited for the 
last delegate to leave so they could sweep up every piece of 
refuse every bit of confetti 
we have to get started immediately after the session we 
really do said mary mead a spokeswoman for the convention we 
have to move fast 
construction of the podium stairways and wooden floors took 
500000 manhours it will take just 8000 manhours to rip down 
the 12 million pounds of scaffolding tear up the 150000 square 
feet of plywood and take out the 150000 nuts bolts and screws 
the transformation from convention hall to football stadium and 
special events center better be done on schedule according to ms 
mead 
theres a dual high school football game on friday the 26th 
we have to be completely out of here on the 25th she said 
and if that isnt enough incentive the new orleans saints host 
the pittsburgh steelers that weekend in a nationally televised game 
pete vicari whose general contracting company built the 
560000 podium had 20 of his employees stripping the rostrum 
pulling up the carpets and removing the light fixtures late 
thursday 
as of noon friday well just start demolishing and it will be 
all hauled off to the dump vicari said by saturday we should 
be cleared out of the dome 
fred nodier of south central bell had half his staff working a 
midnightto8 am shift tearing down the thousands of feet of 
cable installed for the convention 
the gop parley required 9000 lines of cable compared to the 
last major event a super bowl and its 1000 cable lines 
its monumental but we have a good team he said 
the convention staff had its employees packing their files 
together last weekend to ensure a speedy departure as soon as the 
gavel was pounded to end the last session 
its just like when you put it together you have to do it in

a jump in the syphilis rate to the highest level 
in 37 years shows that minorities and particularly heterosexuals 
have failed to heed the message about practicing safe sex despite 
the aids scare health officials say 
the national centers for disease control on thursday reported 
35241 cases of syphilis in the united states in 1987 the rate of 
146 per 100000 people was up from an estimated 114 a year 
earlier and equaled the 1982 rate as the highest since the rate of 
167 in 1950 
reported us cases of syphilis rose 30 percent in two years 
from 27143 or 115 per 100000 in 1985 the cdc said 
the increase was greatest for blacks and hispanics 
groups for which incidence rates were already high the cdc said 
in its weekly report 
the increases came during a period when sexually transmitted 
disease rates were falling among homosexual men the largest group 
at risk for aids the use of condoms and other safesex techniques 
lessen the likelihood of contracting all venereal diseases 
homosexual men have taken safe sex messages seriously 
said dr joel greenspan a cdc specialist in sexually transmitted 
diseases they have changed their behavior minority people and 
particularly heterosexuals have not gotten that message 
from 1986 to 1987 among americans 15 to 64 years old the 
syphilis rate for black males increased 36 percent from 106 per 
100000 people to 145 and the rate for black females shot up 43 
percent from 56 per 100000 to 79 
the rate for hispanic males rose 7 percent from 66 to 71 cases 
per 100000 while the rate for hispanic women rose 24 percent 
from 18 to 22 
in contrast the rate for white males dropped from 64 to 57 
cases per 100000 apparently due to a drop in syphilis among 
homosexual men the rate for white females rose but slightly from 
22 to 26 the cdc said 
the increase in syphilis appears to be concentrated in a few 
urban areas 57 percent of all us cases last year were reported 
in florida california and new york 
while the exact cause of the increase is not known the cdc 
speculated on some possible factors in january when it released its 
preliminary syphilis figures for 1987 including 
an increase in prostitution in which the crack or other drugs 
are exchanged for sex 
a decrease in the resources available for programs to control 
syphilis 
syphilis caused by a bacterium can lead to the degeneration of 
the bones heart nerve tissue and other parts of the body if left 
untreated the disease which produces chancre sores is treated 
with antibiotics 
in its report thursday the cdc suggested several steps to curb 
the increase in syphilis including a move to reemphasize the 
traditional methods of syphilis control interviews with venereal 
disease patients and sex partner notification 
the agency also suggested screening for sexually transmitted 
diseases in highrisk populations assuring better access to 
medical care through speedy service and evening hours and further 
surveillance efforts to monitor the problem

the government controlled by gen 
manuel antonio noriega shut down a private radio station that 
extensively covered the death and funeral of a former president who 
was a harsh critic of the regime 
radio noticias owner carlos fabregas said thursday that 
officials from the justice ministry arrived at the station 
wednesday night and read an order to employees closing it for 
inciting subversion 
fabregas spoke in a live interview over radio alegre another 
privately owned station ministry officials were not available for 
comment 
radio noticias closely reported the death last week and the 
funeral on monday of former president arnulfo arias madrid 
arias 86 who died in miami was three times elected president 
and three times overthrown by the military 
the funeral brought huge crowds into the streets of panama city 
in what became a protest procession against the government which 
noriega controls as head of the 15000member defense forces 
the authorities are alarmed by this demonstration fabregas 
said 
noriega is under us indictment on drug trafficking charges 
which he denies 
dissent against noriega and efforts by the reagan 
administration including economic sanctions have failed to force 
the general out of power 
days after noriega was indicted president eric arturo delvalle 
tried to fire him as military chief noriega had the national 
legislature oust delvalle 
delvalle went into hiding but the united states still 
recognizes him as panamas legitimate president 
since july 1987 the government has closed the opposition 
newspapers la prensa extra and el siglo and the radio stations 
mundial and continente they reopened briefly at one point but were 
closed again 
the government also closed quiubo a satirical magazine and 
gaceta financiera a financial weekly 
it closed channel 5 the television station owned by delvalle

in the heart of george bushs republican 
convention some republican rebels came to preach the gospel of 
minimalist government 
they were libertarians believers in the smallest government 
possible the fewest government restraints on personal liberty and 
freedom they call it being fiscally conservative socially 
tolerant 
from a booth in a hotel marketplace selling convention 
souvenirs the libertarian republican organizing committee passed 
out literature searched for converts and its officers said 
collected hundreds of names and addresses 
colin hunter owner of a computer software company in 
californias silicon valley is the organizations national 
chairman 
essentially hunter and the libertarians embrace most of the 
reagan administrations economic programs but contend they have 
fallen far short of perfection 
hunter and the libertarians would take the gop out of social 
issues almost entirely and they seek a noninterventionist foreign 
policy including deep cuts in defense budgets 
specifically they advocate 
fighting off a tax increase 
fighting against protectionist trade legislation 
making deep cuts in entitlement programs including phasing out 
social security and welfare 
turning many government agencies and services over to private 
enterprise 
opposing all attempts to legislate morality 
urging the legalization of drugs for adults 
advocating a prochoice policy on abortion 
the emphasis is on individual liberty against the power of the 
government hunter said in an interview 
ive been extremely gratified by the response he said 
adding that the most negative feedback his libertarian ideas 
received at the republican convention came from the supporters of 
television preacher pat robertson 
hunter calls robertson the ayatollah 
hunter says he founded his organization after coming to the 
conclusion that the ideas of libertarianism could best flourish 
inside the twoparty system he opposes the thirdparty strategy 
represented by the national libertarian party as essentially 
hopeless 
hunter contends that the republican party is not a monolith 
especially on social issues 
fifty percent of the delegates here are prochoice he 
asserted contending that the percentage among republican voters as 
a whole is higher than that 
other republicans are afraid well turn the country over to 
jerry falwell he declared 
the problem he contended is that the republican party has 
allowed the religious right to capture the reputation of being 
the font of ideas we think that the key ideological debate in 
america is happening within the republican party 
he was asked about the proposal to legalize drugs 
the parallels with prohibition are precise he replied 
there is now a massive crime wave there are extremely high 
profits involved to us its clear the evils of making it legal 
outweigh whatever it will still be a vice but not a crime 
he said aid to the contra rebels in nicaragua should end simply 
because it has not worked because the contras have not ignited a 
spark with the nicaraguan people 
we really have a giant welfare program for the contras he 
said 
hunter said he did endorse us aid to antisoviet insurgents in 
afghanistan in part because it they had the obvious support of the 
vast majority of the afghan people 
with all the changes his philosophy would impose hunter was 
asked what laws libertarians would repeal if they had majority 
vetoproof control of both houses of congress 
the only law we would have to repeal is the law imposing 
penalties for income tax evasion he replied 
an associate eric garris the organizations national director 
added we believe that taxation is theft 
what we would actually do is reduce the size and scope of 
government as quickly as possible given the political situation 
and given reality hunter said

the sandinista government said it will 
extend its unilateral ceasefire with contra rebels and is ready to 
resume peace talks immediately according to a us senator who met 
with president daniel ortega 
also thursday the government said that radio catolica can go 
back on the air but without news broadcasts 
monsignor bismarck carballo spokesman for the catholic 
archdiocese in the capital managua said radio catolica would 
resume broadcasting today 38 days after being ordered shut for 
news coverage that allegedly incited violence 
sen christopher dodd dconn who met thursday with ortega and 
his brother defense minister humberto ortega said the sandinistas 
are willing to resume peace talks immediately with the 
ussupported rebels known as contras 
there are no preconditions on talks with the rebels dodd 
said at augusto cesar sandino airport shortly before leaving 
nicaragua 
they said they would extend the ceasefire indefinitely 
said dodd a member of the senate foreign relations committee and 
chairman of the senate subcommittee on western hemisphere affairs 
the truce began march 21 two days before the government and 
rebels signed an agreement to negotiate a permanent end to the 
7yearold war highlevel peace talks broke off june 9 and a 
unilateral government extension of the ceasefire was set to expire 
aug 31 
ortega on thursday renewed his proposal to begin a new round of 
talks in managua on aug 26 the rebels citing restrictions on 
their freedom of movement said they would not return to the 
capital they also demanded that the president take part in any 
future discussions 
the interior ministry has authorized the roman catholic churchs 
radio station to resume broadcasting an interior ministry 
spokesman speaking on condition of anonymity said carballo sent a 
letter wednesday pledging the station will not broadcast news 
the leftist government closed radio catolica indefinitely on 
july 11 the same day it shut down la prensa the countrys only 
opposition newspaper for 15 days the orders came a day after 
police violently broke up a demonstration by opposition groups 
la prensa has since resumed publication 
the government said radio catolicas news program church 
news had incited violence disorder and lack of respect for the 
constitutional government 
dodd also said he discussed with the sandinistas the latest us 
senate package to provide humanitarian aid to the contras 
obviously they are not happy dodd said adding that the 
possibility of renewed us military aid to the rebels was very 
open and that the government should know about that 
us military aid for the rebels expired in february on aug 
10 the senate approved a 27 million humanitarian aid package for 
the rebels with a possible second vote on 163 million in 
stockpiled military aid later this year

the last night of the republican national 
convention presented the television networks two stories but 
little time to pursue them 
news has broken out gentlemen abcs brit hume proclaimed 
the big story was the controversy over sen dan quayles 
national guard enlistment and the related questions about what 
this possible blot on the gop vice presidential nominee said about 
the man at the top of the ticket 
the other story was how well vice president george bush would 
deliver his acceptance speech which was praised in advance by cbs 
anchor dan rather as an excellent speech as you read it on 
paper 
as nbc anchor tom brokaw noted bushs speech and quayles 
which preceded it took up a lot of time when the cameras were 
compelled to focus on quayle and bush in their own words with a 
partisan crowd cheering them on 
it was time when floor reporters could not raise new questions 
or variations of older questions about whether strings had been 
pulled to get quayle into the guard 
it was an advantage the bush campaign gratefully accepted 
quayle did talk briefly to reporters promising to answer all their 
questions about the controversy but not now 
well give him credit rather said praising quayle for 
facing the microphones even if he said nothing 
abcs reporters engaged in some selfexamination about the 
medias role in the quayle story which the networks george will 
called a journalistic feeding frenzy 
abcs david brinkley said the days big story was at least 
partly a function of the thousands of reporters on the scene 
if this had happened in the middle of the desert you would 
never have heard about it brinkley said it was the first new 
thing the first unexpected thing the first news weve had 
and the networks jeff greenfield said it had taken about 3 
seconds for a backlash against the media to appear on the 
convention floor recalling the watergate hearings greenfield 
suggested the key question for the bush brain trust was what did 
they know and when did they know it 
thus quayles acceptance speech was a test one which cbs 
commentator kevin phillips likened to richard nixons checkers 
speech in 1952 which saved his spot as dwight d eisenhowers 
running mate im not so sure he turned the corner phillips 
said of quayle 
on bushs speech however the networks were unanimous it was 
at least a good speech and many thought it the best speech of 
bushs career 
he looked presidential walter cronkite said on cbs 
a splendid piece of work well delivered and well written 
said nbcs john chancellor 
it was a george bush i hadnt seen before effective not 
eloquent he was studied he was poetic brinkley said he 
delivered a good speech very well 
abcs sam donaldson was alone in taking issue with some of what 
bush said accusing him of distorting the record of democratic 
nominee michael dukakis on guns the pledge of allegiance and 
whether the nation is in decline 
despite the outbreak of news all three networks showed a 
weakness for trivia 
cbs which went on an hour earlier than the competition was 
alone with murky longdistance pictures of quayles motorcade as 
it arrived at the superdome 
later both cbs and nbc jumped quickly on equally unedifying 
coverage of bushs motorcade while abc stayed with an interview 
with bush campaign chief james baker until it too succumbed to 
the majesty of a vicepresidential auto ride 
cbs again scored over the competition by having exclusive 
pictures of bush actually stepping out of his limousine 
no one could resist the balloon drop theyve gotta be 
handtied brokaw marveled 
rather at least put the balloons and the rest of the spectacle 
in some perspective by recalling the attitude of president reagans 
campaign advisers just put up our pictures and well take it 
and win the election 
perhaps with that in mind cbs was alone in refusing to carry 
bushs short campaign film instead it put up the same warm images 
with commentary by bill plante

government troops overran a rebel camp 
killing four men taking two prisoners and capturing a cache of 
arms and ammunition an army official said 
lt col godfrey bamwesigye said thursday that the battle 
occurred this week but he didnt say when he said the rebels were 
army deserters who had been members of the uganda federal 
democratic movement and the uganda freedom movement 
both movements fought alongside president yoweri musevenis 
national resistance army during a fiveyear guerilla war against 
former civilian president milton obote 
obote was overthrown in a july 1985 military coup museveni 
established a broadbased government that included several other 
former guerrilla groups including the uganda federal democratic 
movement and the uganda freedom movement 
since then museveni has had to fight at least eight guerrilla 
groups trying to bring down his government

the question of whether dan quayle pulled 
strings to get into the national guard during the vietnam war 
dominated the last day of the republican convention but by nights 
end many delegates had rallied behind their vice presidential 
nominee 
some delegates said they still want to hear a fuller explanation 
from the indiana senator but others called it small potatoes and 
predicted the issue would blow away quickly 
sen phil gramm of texas said if the worst thing dan quayles 
ever done in his life is that his dad helped him commit six years 
to america in the national guard hes almost eligible for 
sainthood he certainly isnt disqualified from being vice 
president 
gordon k durnil the head of the indiana delegation called it 
an anchorbooth generated story tomorrow it will be over and 
there will be something else 
william brock the former national gop party chairman and labor 
secretary said i think we had a 24hour problem 
john katopodis of birmingham ala a jefferson county 
commissioner said he had an uneasy feeling another shoe is going 
to drop he said he wished quayle had tackled the issue 
headon in his acceptance speech 
quayle 41 drew cheers when he said he was very proud of 
his six years in the national guard he made no further reference 
to the controversy by joining the guard he was almost certain of 
avoiding service in vietnam 
eddie mahe a republican strategist from washington said that 
15000 people got to experience that insidethebeltway feeling 
we live with all the time 
more than a few delegates said that if quayles aim was to stay 
out of vietnam in 1969 he had plenty of company 
in those days said gene ward the chairman of the hawaii 
delegation and a vietnam veteran everybody and their uncle was 
trying to get an angle about how to get out of the draft 
they used to say you were bad if you went to vietnam and now 
theyre saying if you didnt that youre somehow unpatriotic 
how times have changed said ward 
samuel atkins 43 a watkinsville ga lawyer said the baby 
boomers will understand but the older generation may hold it 
against him 
rep helen delich bentley of maryland who initially suggested 
quayle might have to withdraw said thursday night the issue was 
dead and had been based on inaccurate news reports 
whats the big deal asked sen gordon humphrey of new 
hampshire a staunch conservative he pulled some strings to 
serve his country he could have gone to canada 
rep bob dornan of california said it requires a 
checkerslike speech quickly before this gets out of hand a 
reference to the speech that richard m nixon delivered in 1952 
when he got caught up in a slush fund controversy nixon 
running mate to dwight d eisenhower said he would not give back 
one gift a dog named checkers 
george walker bush jr the vice presidents eldest son called 
the furor over quayles military service ridiculous and said he 
joined the national guard too in 1968 
it was available and i went said bush 42 who was a 
stateside pilot i thought it was service to my country and im 
proud of it 
sen john mccain of arizona a navy fighter pilot who spent 5 
years in a hanoi prison said serving in the guard is honorable 
if however there is clear evidence that the process may have 
been manipulated to give some kind of special preference then i 
think its a problem that needs to be resolved mccain said 
if quayle had gone to canada i would have been on the floor 
protesting said richard geist a state lawmaker from altoona pa 
tom burch a former green beret who is chairman of the 
250000member vietnam veterans coalition called it a tempest in 
a teapot 
there was nothing unusual about opting for the national 
guard and even if his family helped it wouldnt make any 
difference said burch a virginia delegate he didnt try to 
evade the military

a new elementary school in one of the nations 
most criticized school systems will reinvent the wheel its 
founder says by using corporatestyle management to boost learning 
like they do profits 
the school dedicated thursday has gained the blessing and the 
backing of such giants of capitalism as mcdonalds corp and united 
airlines 
its a compelling plan to educate young people not only in 
chicago but across the country mcdonalds spokeswoman stephanie 
skurdy said after the dedication of the corporatecommunity school 
on the citys west side 
the school will be run like a business meaning that if 
principal elaine c mosley a former elementary school principal in 
suburban oak park is unable to produce a superior product 
students she could be replaced said joe kellman the schools 
founder 
the tuitionfree school slated to begin classes sept 6 with 
150 students and seven teachers is being subsidized by almost 
three dozen sponsors 
sixteen of the corporations raised 2 million of the 3 million 
needed to run the school for three years officials said the 
annual cost is about 4100 per student about the same as the cost 
to educate public school students 
its a model project hopeful for urban reform in school 
programs said elaine younglove spokeswoman for another sponsor 
united airlines which has pledged 300000 in support over a 
threeyear period mcdonalds has given 75000 
we thought it was an opportunity theres a high dropout 
rate in chicago and thats one of our personal concerns getting 
that dropout rate down she said thursday night 
chicago schools last year were called the nations worst by us 
education secretary william j bennett who labeled the citys 
educational bureaucracy the blob and said the system was in 
educational meltdown 
nearly 45 percent of students who began school with the class of 
1985 dropped out before graduating and half of the citys public 
high schools ranked in the bottom 1 percent of us schools for 
student scores on the american college test statistics have shown 
the corporatecommunity school will try to start students out on 
a better foot 
were going to reinvent the wheel said kellman 68 head of 
the globe glass amp mirror co and founder of the better boys 
foundation were going to turn out inner city children with a 
great education 
the first wave of youngsters most of them black or hispanic 
were chosen randomly by computer from 2000 applications for the 
initial preschool through third grade program the seven teachers 
were selected from 200 applicants from around the nation said 
project director primus mootry 
classes are to be organized by skill level rather than age so 
slower students are not predisposed to an early image of failure 
organizers said the curriculum will emphasize basics of reading 
writing arithmetic and spelling as well as the development of 
social and reasoning skills 
mootry said one teacher and one teachers aid will be assigned 
to each class of 25 pupils and parental involvement will be 
encouraged 
the real challenge is to work without some of the constraints 
of the public school system which has 430000 students mootry 
said 
plans call for the school to be expanded over the next several 
years to a 300student facility with classes up to the eighth grade 
frank gardner chicago board of education president told 
reporters the citys public school system will be watching the new 
school carefully 
we applaud this and if we can transfer anything to our 
schools we will take advantage of it he said 
charles ruder a spokesman for corporate sponsor sears roebuck 
amp co said it is an experiment we thought we ought to be a part 
of communities that we do business in its important that 
they be viable and education is a key to that 
other sponsors include quaker oats co baxter international 
inc and walgreen drug stores

the new george bush looks sounds and acts a 
lot like the old one but he stands alone now with a scant three 
months to prove himself a leader who deserves the kind of loyalty 
he has been delivering 
his hour upon the stage at the republican national convention 
was a solid sendoff for the campaign against democratic 
presidential nominee michael dukakis even though bush imagemakers 
oversold the performance they had said it was going to a sort of 
debut an introduction to the american electorate 
bush himself said it was the most important speech of his 
career an unmatched opportunity to present himself and his goals 
but this was no transformation indeed if one were needed the 
vice president selfdescribed underdog to dukakis would be in far 
worse campaign trouble 
he needed no introduction he needed to blend the promise of 
continuity with a set of goals to call his own that is the task 
and the dilemma that makes running for president as vice president 
a daunting assignment 
bush also had to get his convention back on its script after a 
day of controversy over the military record of sen dan quayle of 
indiana his vice presidential nominee 
that issue remains a problem for quayle and therefore for bush 
but it barely intruded on the gop finale quayle was nominated 
without so much as a murmur of dissent and drew no louder cheers 
than when he said he was proud of his stint in the national guard 
the service that kept him out of the vietnam draft 
it was a distraction bush didnt need on a night he and his 
strategists considered crucial had bush stuck to his plan to name 
his running mate on thursday instead of moving it up two days he 
would have avoided the quayle flap questions about his military 
record and about stringpulling to get into the national guard 
surely would have arisen but they wouldnt have emerged in the 
hothouse atmosphere of a political convention where such things 
flourish 
nevertheless bush accomplished what he set out to do he said 
his piece with humor and style he played the cheering crowd 
effectively sometimes speaking over the din sometimes pausing to 
take the ovations 
neither dukakis nor bush ranks among the masters of political 
oratory both dukakis and bush rose to their occasions the 
democratic nominee in his atlanta acceptance speech and bush in his 
thursday night address 
bush said it was the night his campaign really began he spoke 
of the achievements of the reagan administration and claimed a 
piece of the credit but the pronoun changed from we to i 
as he dealt with the campaign ahead and with the measures he said 
he will take in the white house 
he said he had helped reagan for 7 12 years with candor and 
with loyalty but now you must see me for what i am the 
republican candidate for president of the united states the vice 
president said 
this election isnt about ideology its about competence 
dukakis had said in atlanta 
competence is the creed of the technocrat who makes sure the 
gears mesh but doesnt for a second understand the magic of the 
machine said bush the truth is this election is about the 
beliefs we share the values we honor the principles we hold 
dear 
debating dukakis joking about his lack of charisma and about 
putting his silver foot up to relax etching his own set of 
proposals for a new administration bush gave what republican 
cheerleaders called the speech of his life 
he had to said sen alfonse damato of new york he was 
like a man down to his last 10 in a poker game he had to win it 
otherwise hes out 
there are a good many hands to be played before the nov 8 
election decides who really is out

here are some comments on the presidential 
race as the republicans wound up their national convention in new 
orleans 
 
george bush accepting the presidential nomination of his party 
there are a lot of great stories in politics about the underdog 
winning and this is going to be one of them i mean to run hard 
to fight hard to stand on the issues and i mean to win 
 
dan quayle alluding to the controversy over his military 
service as a young man i served six years in the national 
guard and like millions of americans who have served in the guard 
and who serve today and i am proud of that 
 
rep bob dornan of california saying quayle must act swiftly to 
diffuse the controversy over his military service it requires a 
checkerslike speech and he must do must do it quickly before 
this gets out of hand

israel dealt a strong blow to the palestinian 
rebellion in the occupied lands outlawing arab popular committees 
and threatening their members and supporters with arrest and 
10year jail terms 
popular committees are grassroots organizations carrying out 
the directives of the uprisings underground leadership organizing 
demonstrations and patrols and supplying food and medical aid to 
the needy 
the decision to outlaw them came amid a twoday general strike 
launched in the west bank on thursday to protest israels policy of 
deporting arab activists the strike orders were passed around the 
west bank by masked youths many of whom shouted their message on 
loudspeakers 
palestinian protesters clashed with israeli troops throughout 
the occupied lands thursday leaving 11 arabs wounded red cross 
and hospital officials in the gaza strip said soldiers beat and 
clubbed more than 250 palestinians 
a threeday curfew in the gaza strip ended thursday but 180000 
arabs in 11 refugee camps and neighborhoods remained confined to 
their homes in addition 85000 west bank palestinians from nine 
villages and camps were under curfew 
defense minister yitzhak rabin said his decision to outlaw the 
popular committees would create legal means of dealing with the 
activists of the palestinian uprising 
but this is a formal judicial step that does not abolish the 
need to capture arrest put on trial or deport these people 
he said on israel radio 
the defense ministry said every palestinian who continues to be 
a member of the committees or assist them would be arrested and put 
on trial 
the committees stage underground classes in case of school 
closure by the israeli authorities they gather donations for 
families of the uprisings martyrs arab prisoners or those who 
who lost their jobs in israel during the 8monthold rebellion 
palestinians appeared enraged by rabins decision 
khanan ashrawi a lecturer at bir zeit university in the west 
bank said the step was only an excuse for further escalation 
the essence of the committees is that theyre popular they 
are trying to strike at all the palestinians in that case they 
will deport everybody its definitely a policy and its a ruthless 
policy she told the associated press 
meanwhile representatives of the european community lodged a 
protest with the foreign ministry expressing grave concern 
over the deportations ministry spokesman alon liel said delegates 
from spain greece and germany were told deportations were 
necessary to maintain law and order he said 
the foreign ministry also said it was checking allegations in a 
16page amnesty international report claiming israeli troops have 
beaten thousands of arabs since the uprising began in december the 
ministry said the londonbased human rights group conferred with 
biased sources

in 1939 arnold childs had everything a 
21yearold could ask for his health good friends an ivy league 
college degree and a promising job at nbc in new york city 
but the idealistic youth gave it up to cut wood dig potatoes 
and do maintenance on a vermont farm part of an depressionera 
experiment in communal living intended to show that citizenship 
means community service 
the camp in the tiny town of tunbridge population 200 at the 
time soon became a darling of eleanor roosevelt and the focus of 
nationwide media attention but it was closed after only three 
years when world war ii claimed many of the men who volunteered 
on thursday some of the work crew were reunited as dozens of 
people came to tunbridge to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 
birth of eugen rosenstockhuessy a dartmouth college professor who 
helped found camp william james and others like it in the 1930s he 
died in 1973 
rosenstockhuessys idea was to develop a service program in 
which young adults from across the country would live together and 
perform chores that would benefit the community 
the idea was to actually make some changes in the civilian 
conservation corps the new deal program established in 1933 to 
give jobs to unemployed youths said jack preiss who helped found 
the camp and wrote a book about it 
what we were trying to do is make the corps the work service 
a more democratic opportunity because it was confined to unemployed 
kids from the cities he said and we felt public service is 
something everyone should do from college students to youths in 
the slums to young adults in tunbridge 
the camp was founded on philosopher william james theory that 
work service is the moral equivalent of war that uniting 
people from all walks of life could foster peace camaraderie and 
the spirit of community 
we could never really have war if people are working face to 
face said rosenstockhuessys granddaughter margaret huessy 
i dont think anyone could actually kill anyone if they knew 
them 
childs 69 a columbus ohio native who now lives in eugene 
ore left his new york job when he heard about the camp from 
fellow dartmouth graduates i was getting a little tired of the 
city and i thought the project would be an adventure he said 
at first he and other participants lived in barracks at a ccc 
camp in the nearby central vermont town of sharon they harvested 
crops worked on machinery and cleared fire lanes 
i was milking 15 holsteins twice a day said preiss 68 now 
a sociology professor at duke university in durham nc 
to develop the experiment they solicited government funds and 
tried to gain community support by assisting residents with farm 
and other tasks 
the camp which moved to tunbridge when the workers acquired a 
farm was visited by mrs roosevelt in 1941 
it also caught the eye of journalist and poet dorothy thompson 
who presented president franklin roosevelt with citizen petitions 
asking him to support the camp she collected the papers in the 
tunbridge town hall basement where former campers and other 
students of rosenstockhuessy gathered for lunch thursday 
preiss and others said the spirit of the camp remained when it 
folded in 1942 and they returned to mainstream society the camp 
was cited when the peace corps was established in 1961 preiss said 
childs spent 1970 to 1980 overseas working for the united 
nations world food program i found that particularly working in 
countries like india and nepal the work i did on the farms and 
camp william james i can definitely see the connection between 
development work and work at the camp 
after lunch the former campers went outside to perform one last 
community service project they fanned out in tunbridges 
cemeteries to map veterans gravestones for memorial day ceremonies 
next year 
citizenship means giving something back to the community 
preiss said

indiana a young leader who has become a forceful voice in

and so tonight is for big things but ill try to be fair to the 
other side ill try to hold my charisma in check and 
applause 
i reject the temptation to engage in personal references my 
approach this evening is as sergeant joe friday used to say 
just the facts maam applause 
and after all after all the facts are on our side 
i seek the presidency for a single purpose a purpose that has 
motivated millions of americans across the years and the ocean 
voyages i seek the presidency to build a better america its that 
simple and that big 
im a man who sees life in terms of missions missions defined 
and missions completed 
and when i was a torpedo bomber pilot they defined the mission 
for us and before we took off we all understood that no matter 
what you try to reach the target and there have been other 
missions for me congress and china the cia but im here 
tonight and i am your candidate because the most important work 
of my life is to complete the mission we started in 1980 
applause 
and how and how do we complete it we build on it 
the stakes are high this year and the choice is crucial for the 
differences between the two candidates are as deep and wide as they 
have ever been in our long history 
not only two very different men but two very different ideas of 
the future will be voted on this election day 
and what it all comes down to is this my opponents view of the 
world sees a long slow decline for our country an inevitable fall 
mandated by impersonal historical forces 
but america is not in decline america is a rising nation 
he sees applause he sees america as another pleasant country 
on the un roll call somewhere between albania and zimbabwe and 
i see america as the leader a unique nation with a special role 
in the world 
and this has been called the american century because in it we 
were the dominant force for good in the world we saved europe 
cured polio went to the moon and lit the world with our culture 
and now we are on the verge of a new century and what countrys 
name will it bear i say it will be another american century 
our work is not done our force is not spent 
there are those there are those who say there isnt much of a 
difference this year but america dont let em fool ya

two parties this year ask for your support both will speak of 
growth and peace but only one has proved it can deliver two 
parties this year ask for your trust but only one has earned it 
eight years ago eight years ago i stood here with ronald 
reagan and we promised together to break with the past and return 
america to her greatness eight years later look at what the 
american people have produced the highest level of economic growth 
in our entire history and the lowest level of world tensions in 
more than 50 years 
you know some say this isnt an election about ideology but 
its an election about competence well its nice of them to want 
to play on our field but this election isnt only about 
competence for competence is a narrow ideal 
competence makes the trains run on time but doesnt know where 
theyre going applause competence competence is the creed of 
the technocrat who makes sure the gears mesh but doesnt for a 
second understand the magic of the machine 
the truth is applause the truth is this election is about 
the beliefs we share the values we honor and the principles we 
hold dear 
but but since someone brought up competence 
consider the size of our triumph a record number of americans 
at work a record high percentage of our people with jobs a record 
high of new businesses high rate of new businesses a record high 
rate of real personal income 
these are facts applause 
and one way and one way we know our opponents know the facts is 
that to attack our record they have to misrepresent it they call 
it a swiss cheese economy well thats the way it may look to the 
three blind mice applause 
but but when they were in charge it was all holes and no 
cheese applause 
inflation you know the litany inflation was 13 percent when 
we came in we got it down to four interest rates interest rates 
were more than 21 we cut them in half unemployment unemployment 
was up and climbing and now its the lowest in 14 years 
my friends eight years ago this economy was flat on its back 
intensive care and we came in and gave it emergency treatment got 
the temperature down by lowering regulation and got the blood 
pressure down when we lowered taxes and pretty soon the patient 
was up back on his feet and stronger than ever 
and now who do we hear knocking on the door but the same doctors 
who made him sick and theyre telling us to put them in charge of 
the case again my friends theyre lucky we dont hit em with a 
malpractice suit

weve created 17 million new jobs the past five years more 
than twice as many as europe and japan combined and theyre good 
jobs the majority of them created in the past six years paid an 
average average of more than 22000 a year and someone better 
take a message to michael tell him tell him that we have been 
creating good jobs at good wages the fact is they talk and we 
deliver applause 
they promise and we perform 
and there are millions of young americans in their 20s who 
barely remember applause who barely remember the days of gas 
lines and unemployment lines and now theyre marrying and starting 
careers to those young people i say you have the opportunity 
you deserve and im not going to let them take it away from you 
applause 
the leaders the leaders of the expansion have been the women of 
america who helped create the new jobs and filled two out of every 
three of them and to the women of america i say you know better 
than anyone that equality begins with economic empowerment youre 
gaining economic power and im not going to let them take it away 
from you applause 
there are millions there are millions of older americans who 
were brutalized by inflation we arrested it and were not going 
to let it out on furlough applause 
were going and were going to keep the social security trust 
fund sound and out of reach of the big spenders to americas 
elderly i say once again you have the security that is your 
right and im not going to let them take it away from you 
i know the liberal democrats are worried about the economy 
theyre worried its going to remain strong and theyre right it 
is with the right leadership it will remain strong 
but lets be frank things arent perfect in this country there 
are people who havent tasted the fruits of the expansion ive 
talked to farmers about the bills they cant pay and ive been to 
the factories that feel the strain of change and ive seen the 
urban children who play amidst the shattered glass and the 
shattered lives and you know there are the homeless and you 
know it doesnt do any good to debate endlessly which policy 
mistake of the 70s is responsible theyre there and we have to 
help them 
but what we must remember if were to be responsible and 
compassionate is that economic growth is the key to our endeavors 
i want growth that stays that broadens and that touches 
finally all americans from the hollows of kentucky to the sunlit 
streets of denver from the suburbs of chicago to the broad avenues 
of new york and from the oil fields of oklahoma to the farms of 
the great plains 
and can we do it of course we can we know how weve done it 
if we if we continue to grow at our current rate we will be able 
to produce 30 million jobs in the next eight years

and we will do it by maintaining our commitment to free and 
fair trade by keeping government spending down and by keeping 
taxes down 
our economic life is not the only test of our success one issue 
overwhelms all the others and that is the issue of peace 
look at the world on this bright august night the spirit of 
democracy is sweeping the pacific rim china feels the winds of 
change new democracies assert themselves in south america and one 
by one the unfree places fall not to the force of arms but to the 
force of an idea freedom works applause 
and we we have a new relationship with the soviet union the 
inf treaty the beginning of the soviet withdrawal from 
afghanistan the beginning of the end of the soviet proxy war in 
angola and with it the independence of namibia iran and iraq move 
toward peace 
its a watershed it is no accident 
it happened when we acted on the ancient knowledge that strength 
and clarity lead to peace weakness and ambivalence lead to war 
you see you see weakness tempts aggressors strength stops them 
i will not allow this country to be made weak again never 
the tremors in the soviet world continue the hard earth there 
has not yet settled perhaps what is happening will change our 
world forever and perhaps not a prudent skepticism is in order 
and so is hope 
but either way were in an unprecedented position to change the 
nature of our relationship not by preemptive concession but by 
keeping our strength not by yielding up defense systems with 
nothing won in return but by hard cool engagement in the tug and 
pull of diplomacy applause 
my life my life has been lived in the shadow of war i almost 
lost my life in one 
and i hate war love peace 
and we have peace 
and i am not going to let anyone take it away from us 
our economy is strong but not invulnerable and the peace is 
broad but can be broken and now we must decide we will surely 
have change this year but will it be change that moves us forward 
or change that risks retreat 
in 1940 when i was barely more than a boy franklin roosevelt 
said we shouldnt change horses in midstream

my friends these days the world moves even more quickly and 
now after two great terms a switch will be made but when you 
have to change horses in midstream doesnt it make sense to switch 
to one whos going the same way 
an election that is about ideas and values is also about 
philosophy and i have one 
at the bright center is the individual and radiating out from 
him or her is the family the essential unit of closeness and of 
love for it is the family that communicates to our children to 
the 21st century our culture our religious faith our traditions 
and history 
from the individual to the family to the community and then on 
out to the town the church and the school and still echoing out 
to the county the state and the nation each doing only what it 
does well and no more and i believe that power must always be 
kept close to the individual close to the hands that raise the 
family and run the home 
i am guided by certain traditions one is that there is a god 
and he is good and his love while free has a selfimposed cost 
we must be good to one another 
i believe in another tradition that is by now imbedded in the 
national soul it is that learning is good in and of itself you 
know the mothers of the jewish ghettoes of the east would pour 
honey on a book so the children would know that learning is sweet 
and the parents who settled hungry kansas would take their children 
in from the fields when a teacher came that is our history 
and there is another tradition and that is the idea of 
community a beautiful word with a big meaning though liberal 
democrats have an odd view of it they see community as a 
limited cluster of interest groups locked in odd conformity and 
in this view the country waits passive while washington sets the 
rules 
but thats not what community means not to me 
for we are a nation of communities of thousands and tens of 
thousands of ethnic religious social business labor union 
neighborhood regional and other organizations all of them 
varied voluntary and unique 
this is america the knights of columbus the grange hadassah 
the disabled american veterans the order of ahepa the business 
and professional women of america the union hall the bible study 
group lulac holy name a brilliant diversity spread like 
stars like a thousand points of light in a broad and peaceful sky

does government have a place yes government is part of the 
nation of communities not the whole just a part 
and i dont hate government a government that remembers that 
the people are its master is a good and needed thing 
i respect oldfashioned common sense and have no great love 
and i have no great love for the imaginings of the social planners 
you see i like whats been tested and found to be true 
for instance 
should public school teachers be required to lead our children 
in the pledge of allegiance my opponent says no and i say yes 
should society be allowed to impose the death penalty on those 
who commit crimes of extraordinary cruelty and violence my 
opponent says no but i say yes 
and should our children should our children have the right to 
say a voluntary prayer or even observe a moment of silence in the 
schools my opponent says no but i say yes 
and should free men and women have the right to own a gun to 
protect their home my opponent says no but i say yes 
and is it right to believe in the sanctity of life and protect 
the lives of innocent children my opponent says no but i say 
yes you see we must we must change weve got to change from 
abortion to adoption and let me tell you this barbara and i have 
an adopted granddaughter and the day of her christening we wept 
with joy i thank god that her parents chose life 
im the one who believes it is a scandal to give a weekend 
furlough to a hardened firstdegree killer who hasnt even served 
enough time to be eligible for parole 
im the one who says a drug dealer who is responsible for the 
death of a policeman should be subject to capital punishment 
and im the one who will not raise taxes my opponent now says 
my opponent now says hell raise them as a last resort or a third 
resort well when a politician talks like that you know thats 
one resort hell be checking into and my opponent wont rule out 
raising taxes but i will 
and the congress will push me to raise taxes and ill say no 
and theyll push and ill say no and theyll push again and ill 
say to them read my lips no new taxes 
let me tell you more crowd cheers and chants let me tell 
you more let me just tell you more about the mission 
on jobs my mission is 30 in 8 thirty million jobs in the next 
eight years

every one of our children deserves a firstrate school the 
liberal democrats want power in the hands of the federal 
government and i want power in the hands of the parents and i 
will crowd cheers and i will i will encourage merit schools 
i will give more kids a head start and ill make it easier to save 
for college 
i want a drugfree america and this will not be easy to 
achieve but i want to enlist the help of some people who are 
rarely included tonight i challenge the young people of our 
country to shut down the drug dealers around the world unite with 
us work with us 
zero tolerance isnt just a policy its an attitude tell 
them what you think of people who underwrite the dealers who put 
poison in our society and while youre doing that my 
administration will be telling the dealers whatever we have to do 
well do but your day is over youre history 
i am going to do whatever it takes to make sure the disabled are 
included in the mainstream for too long theyve been left out but 
theyre not going to be left out anymore 
and i am going to stop ocean dumping our beaches should not be 
garbage dumps and our harbors should not be cesspools 
and i am going to have the fbi trace the medical wastes and we 
are going to punish the people who dump those infected needles into 
our oceans lakes and rivers and we must clean the air we must 
reduce the harm done by acid rain 
and i will put incentives back into the domestic energy 
industry for i know from personal experience there is no security 
for the united states in further dependence on foreign oil 
in foreign affairs i will continue our policy of peace through 
strength i will move toward further cuts in strategic and 
conventional arsenals of both the united states and the soviet 
union and the eastern bloc and nato i will modernize and preserve 
our technological edge and that includes strategic defense 
and a priority a priority ban chemical and biological weapons 
from the face of the earth that will be a priority with me 
and i intend to speak for freedom stand for freedom be a 
patient friend to anyone east or west who will fight for freedom 
it seems to me the presidency provides an incomparable 
opportunity for gentle persuasion 
and i hope to stand for a new harmony a greater tolerance 
weve come far but i think we need a new harmony among the races 
in our country and were on a journey into a new century and 
weve got to leave that tired old baggage of bigotry behind 
some people who are enjoying our prosperity have forgotten what 
its for but they diminish our triumph when they act as if wealth 
is an end in itself

and there are those who have dropped their standards along the 
way as if ethics were too heavy and slowed their rise to the top 
theres graft in city hall and theres greed on wall street 
theres influence peddling in washington and the small corruptions 
of everyday ambition 
but you see i believe public service is honorable and every 
time i hear that someone has breached the public trust it breaks my 
heart 
and i wonder sometimes if we have forgotten who we are but 
were the people who sundered a nation rather than allow a sin 
called slavery and were the people who rose from the ghettoes 
and the deserts 
and we werent saints but we lived by standards we celebrated 
the individual but we werent selfcentered we were practical 
but we didnt live only for material things we believed in getting 
ahead but blind ambition wasnt our way 
the fact is prosperity has a purpose it is to allow us to 
pursue the better angels to give us time to think and grow 
prosperity with a purpose means taking your idealism and making it 
concrete by certain acts of goodness 
it means helping a child from an unhappy home learn how to read 
and i thank my wife barbara for all her work in helping people to 
read and all her work for literacy in this country 
it means teaching troubled children through your presence that 
there is such a thing as reliable love some would say its soft 
and insufficiently tough to care about these things but where is 
it written that we must act as if we do not care as if we are not 
moved 
well i am moved i want a kinder and gentler nation 
two men this year ask for your support and you must know us 
as for me i have held high office and done the work of 
democracy day by day yes my parents were prosperous and their 
children sure were lucky but there were lessons we had to learn 
about life 
john kennedy discovered poverty when he campaigned in west 
virginia there were children who had no milk and young teddy 
roosevelt met the new america when he roamed the immigrant streets 
of new york and i learned a few things about life in a place 
called texas 
and when i applause and when i was when i was working on 
this part of the speech barbara came in and asked what i was 
doing and i looked up and i said im working hard and she said 
oh dear dont worry relax sit back take off your shoes and 
put up your silver foot laughter applause 
now we moved to west texas 40 years ago 40 years ago this 
year the war was over and we wanted to get out and make it on our 
own those were exciting days we lived in a little shotgun house 
one room for the three of us worked in the oil business and then 
started my own 
and in time we had six children moved from the shotgun to a 
duplex apartment to a house and lived the dream high school 
football on friday nights little league neighborhood barbecue

people dont see their own experience as symbolic of an era 
but of course we were 
and so was everyone else who was taking a chance and pushing 
into unknown territory with kids and a dog and a car 
but the big thing i learned is the satisfaction of creating 
jobs which meant creating opportunity which meant happy families 
who in turn could do more to help others and enhance their own 
lives 
i learned that the good done by a single good job can be felt in 
ways you cant imagine 
its been said that im not the most compelling speaker and 
there are actually those who claim that i dont always communicate 
in the clearest most concise way but i dare them to keep it up 
go ahead make my 24hour time period laughter applause 
chanting 
well i as crowd chanting ending i may be may not be the 
most eloquent but i learned that early on that eloquence wont 
draw oil from the ground 
and i may sometimes be a little awkward but theres nothing 
selfconscious in my love of country 
and i am a quiet man but applause i am a quiet man but i 
hear the quiet people others dont the ones who raise the family 
pay the taxes meet the mortgage 
and i hear them and i am moved and their concerns are mine 
a president must be many things 
he must be a shrewd protector of americas interests and he 
must be an idealist who leads those who move for a freer and more 
democratic planet 
and he must see to it that government intrudes as little as

what crosses that big desk i have seen the unexpected crisis that 
arrives in a cable in a young aides hand and i have seen problems 
that simmer on for decades and suddenly demand resolution and i 
have seen modest decisions made with anguish and crucial decisions 
made with dispatch 
and so i know that what it all comes down to this election 
what it all comes down to after all the shouting and the cheers 
is the man at the desk and who should sit at that desk 
my friends i am that man

mr chairman mr chairman fellow republicans i accept your 
nomination for vice president of the united states of america 
just just think 82 days from now george bush and i are going 
to win one for you win one for americas future and yes win one 
for the gipper 
my friends i am standing here tonight because of the decision 
made by a great man and a great leader george bush 
two days ago he asked me if i would join him as his running 
mate i am deeply grateful for georges confidence in me and i am 
humbled by the task ahead 
i would like to add a very personal note i am also standing 
here tonight because of the decision my wife marilyn and i made 
nearly 16 years ago to be married marilyn and our children 
tucker benjamin and corinne are my strength my pride my joy my 
love they are and always will be my total life 
many this week have asked who is dan quayle 
the people of indiana know me and now the nation will 
since 1980 i have been a united states senator from indiana 
and very proud of it before that i was a member of the united 
states house of representatives and proud of it and as a young 
man i served six years in the national guard and like millions 
of americans who have served in the guard and who serve today and 
i am proud of that 
in indiana in indiana they call us hoosiers and if you saw the 
movie hoosiers you have a feeling of what life is like in small 
towns of our state 
my hometown of huntington is a little bigger than the town in 
the movie and the high school i graduated from is a little bigger 
than the one that fielded the basketball team in the film

still i identify with that movie hoosiers because it 
reflects the values i grew up with in our small town we believe 
very strongly in hard work in getting an education in offering an 
opportunity to our families yes we love basketball we love 
underdogs but most important we love our country 
so tonight so tonight i am one humble hoosier whose efforts 
to devote part of his life to public service have led him here 
i would have been quite happy spending my life in huntington in 
the newspaper business watching my kids grow seeing a community 
with plenty of opportunity to go around but i looked around me in 
the mid70s and i saw threats to the future of my family and to the 
values that could once be taken for granted in our country 
beyond my town there were communities torn by crime and drugs 
and there were neighborhoods where the very word opportunity 
didnt exist because there were no jobs 
i decided to try to change these things to make opportunity 
replace despair and to make the future just as good as the past 
for the families of the many huntingtons of great our land 
that was 1976 when i was first elected to the house of 
representatives but both houses of congress and the white house in 
the hands of liberal democrats it was a lot tougher than i ever 
imagined to turn my determination into reality 
in those jimmy carter years the people running things thought 
government was the answer instead of part of the problem they 
thought high taxes and big spending would solve anything i think 
you know the rest none of their policies worked and the american 
people knew it

in 1980 they voted for a bold new course for the country a 
course that brought us more jobs for working americans more 
security for a peaceloving people more respect from friends and 
foes around the globe more opportunity for women and minorities 
and a renewed belief that america is a land where you can make your 
dreams come true 
the reaganbush revolution has already been written on the pages 
of history now george bush and dan quayle are going to add 
several bold new chapters to the story of the greatest nation god 
ever put on this earth 
when i think when i think of america under the leadership of 
george bush three words come to mind freedom family and future 
freedom first because without it nothing else is possible 
when i was a boy my grandfather used to say to me and i say 
it to you here tonight that america is the greatest nation on 
earth because america is free this is true today and it will 
always be true 
next family george bush understands you understand i 
understand that the family has always been the very heart of 
civilization we know the importance of the family to a child 
growing up we know the help a family can be to a kid out of 
school out of hope out of luck and we know the importance of 
family where one generation helps take care of another young and 
old 
and then there is the future that word symbolizes hope and 
opportunity to make sure hope and opportunity are always there we 
need a strong economy so there will be good jobs for all who seek

we need an investment in our national defense that brings us 
longterm security in the world 
we do not need the future the democratic party sees the party 
of george mcgovern jimmy carter walter mondale crowd boos 
just wait it gets better ted kennedy and now his buddy 
michael dukakis that future has america in retreat that future 
has higher taxes and a guaranteed loss of job opportunities and 
that future has more government intervention in the lives of all of 
us 
the future under george bush means peace and economic 
opportunity for all 
and i can tell you you have george bushs track record to go 
on the tax cuts the republicans have brought america have resulted 
in 17 million new jobs being created 
let me tell you something george bush will not raise your 
taxes period 
and let me tell you something else michael dukakis will he has 
a track record too and that is what it tells us higher taxes 
as the new jobs opened up during our current economic expansion 
not everyone had the necessary skills for them some had lost their 
jobs and others could not find their first one 
in 1983 the job training partnership act became law i was the 
author of that legislation and i am proud of it it established a 
nationwide training program that has a partnership of government 
and the private sector today because of the job training 
partnership act hundreds of thousands of graduates of these 
programs have jobs with a future

officials at an art gallery say a 
sophisticated thief so carefully concealed the removal of 
500000 in small asian works during the asian art curators 
vacation that staffers didnt realize they were gone 
the curator hiram woodward discovered upon his return that 
some 87 works were stolen during the vacation july 22 to aug 13 
said walters art gallery director robert p bergman who announced 
the theft thursday 
some of the objects had greater historical value to the museum 
than monetary value estimated at 500000 bergman said 
please dont confuse the monetary value with what is important 
to us bergman said two of the pieces of porcelain were of 
such detail and beauty their thefts are crimes against our 
cultural heritage 
among the missing articles is the peach bloom vase an 
18inch porcelain vase dating to the 18th century bergman said 
the artifacts were taken from locked plexiglass cases on the 
fourth floor of a separate wing of the museum and the works that 
were left behind were rearranged to prevent detection of the theft 
bergman said staffers and patrons passed the displays without 
noticing anything amiss he added 
fortyseven major pieces of asian art primarily porcelain 
and 40 antique chinese snuff bottles were taken bergman said at a 
news conference 
it was a very sophisticated and well planned sort of thing it 
was not obvious except to anyone who knows the collection piece by 
piece museum spokesman howard white said 
woodward was walking around his galleries as curators will 
do when he noticed pieces missing that he hadnt removed 
bergman said he then checked with various departments who might 
have removed them when it was revealed that nobody had taken the 
objects he went back to the cases and it was evident that they had 
been tampered with 
fbi special agent rosemary vicini said investigators could not 
release any details of the investigation 
a 100000 reward has been offered by lloyds of london the 
underwriter for the museums collection for information that would 
solve the theft 
it was the first major theft at the gallery which was one of 
the greatest private art collections in the world when railroad 
magnate henry walters bequeathed it to the city upon his death in 
1931

gay rights activists who staged a 
demonstration to seek more federal money to fight aids were 
denounced by a small group of young republicans who chanted phrases 
such as please go quick youre all going to die 
the two sides traded slogans thursday during a demonstration 
outside the louisiana superdome where the republican national 
convention was held 
other protests on the last day of the convention included one 
aimed at vice presidential nominee dan quayle and another by 
palestinians denouncing israeli treatment 
about 40 gay rights activists lined up outside a superdome 
entrance as delegates and guests arrived to hear a speech by gop 
presidential nominee george bush 
the demonstrators many of them members of the new york 
citybased group act up carried signs bearing messages such as 
dont abandon people with aids and distributed leaflets 
a group of about 15 young republican men and women quickly 
gathered and began shouting slogans such as please go quick 
youre all going to die and no equal rights for sodomites 
about 15 police officers then lined up between the demonstrators 
and the counterprotesters as the gay rights activists shouted 
back act up fight back fight aids 
some conventioneers laughed as they passed by and many stopped 
to take photographs 
act up member neil broome of new york city said he held out hope 
there are republicans who care 
shortly before the aids protest four other demonstrators held 
up a 12footlong banner with the facetious message draft 
dodgers for quayle 
quayle was at the center of controversy thursday over reports 
that he used the influence of others to gain admittance to the 
national guard to avoid serving in vietnam 
if its ok for the vice president to buy his way out of duty 
then its ok for the poor to refuse to fight said john oswald 
31 of new orleans 
after the gay rights demonstration broke up about 10 people 
identifying themselves as palestinian students gathered outside the 
chainlink fence ringing the superdome 
a spokesman for the group who identified himself as ali ahmed 
a student at the university of houston said the united states 
needs to put pressure on the israelis to end their violent tactics 
on the occupied west bank and the gaza strip

kellogg co has announced a 25state 
recall of about 29000 boxes of frosted miniwheats biscuits cereal 
that may contain too much vitamin a and cause a burning sensation 
in the mouth 
the giant cereal maker also said thursday it had withdrawn an 
unspecified number of boxes of rice krispies cereal at distribution 
points because they may contain ten times more iron than normal 
the levels of vitamin a found in 16ounce and 20ounce boxes of 
frosted miniwheats coded bc117 and bc118 with the expiration date 
of aug 2 1989 may cause shortterm discomfort such as a burning 
tingling sensation in the mouth but will not cause any major 
health risks company spokesman joe stewart said 
the levels of iron found in rice krispies with the code dates 
june 2224 1989 and the letter m are at 100 percent of the 
us recommended daily allowance but would not produce any health 
threat stewart said the product normally contains 10 percent of 
the us rda of iron 
in both cases the cereals may not taste right stewart said 
stewart said he knew of three or four complaints to the company 
about the frosted miniwheats from michigan consumers since 
wednesday at least one consumer experienced a burning sensation 
after eating the cereal 
the cereal normally contains 25 percent of the us rda of 
vitamin a and some of the recalled boxes have contained as much as 
four times that amount stewart said 
the detroit district of the us food and drug administration 
said it had been advised of the recall and the withdrawal 
kellogg advised consumers with the affected frosted miniwheats 
not to eat any of the product and return the entire package top 
with the code dates to the company 
in the case of the rice krispies the company stopped 
distributing the affected product aug 10 but no consumer recall 
will be ordered stewart said he said any consumer dissatisfied 
with the product may follow the directions listed on the box for 
return of the product 
the states affected by the recall of the frosted miniwheats 
are arizona arkansas california indiana illinois iowa

floridas education commissioner says 
about 50 indian schoolchildren can continue to leave their 
reservation for public school in another county where their 
families feel they are more welcome 
the students on the brighton reservation should be able to 
choose education commissioner betty castor said thursday after 
signing a rule that ended a threemonth dispute between two rural 
districts hankering for the students 
the precedentsetting decision came from tallahassee the state 
capital because the school districts okeechobee and glades 
failed to reach an agreement the state has never been called in to 
settle a local territorial dispute castor said 
glades asked castor to issue a ruling earlier this month as the 
end of summer vacation approached both counties open schools 
monday 
ever since a dispute over what the seminole tribe said was the 
unfair disciplining of an indian boy at a glades county school 
seven years ago most families on the reservation have sent their 
children 28 miles to okeechobee countty 
they say they feel more welcome and get a better education than 
in glades county where the reservation is located 
glades county which has the smallest of floridas 67 school 
districts decided in may it wanted seminole children on the 
reservation to attend school there at least until the fourth 
grade enrollment in glades schools has declined in the last 
decade which means declining revenue 
castor said her decision was in the best interest of the 
students 
they have traditionally attended okeechobee schools and it 
is the clear choice of the students involved and of the seminole 
indian tribe she said 
about 140 schoolchildren from the reservation have attended 
okeechobee schools since 1981 while only 20 brighton youngsters 
choose to go to glades county schools 
jim shore an attorney for the florida seminole tribe said 
thursday he could not comment on castors ruling until the tribe 
got official notification

while nerve disorders and other serious effects 
of lead poisoning in children have become rare new research 
indicates that millions could face risks because of bloodlead 
levels previously believed safe 
lead poisoning is still a problem in kids in this country 
said dr frank mitchell a specialist with the centers for disease 
control 
the cdc on thursday said screening for lead in children in 
highrisk areas and reduction of lead in gasoline air and food 
have greatly reduced lead poisoning effects such as nerve disorders 
and kidney damage 
but the agency said longterm effects of lead exposure are 
increasingly being observed with lead levels much lower than 
previously believed harmful 
the numbers of children exposed to lead at these new lower 
levels of concern are estimated at several million the cdc 
said in its weekly report summarizing findings in a report to 
congress by the us agency for toxic substances and disease 
registry 
low levels of lead exposure have been linked to learning 
disabilities in children while exposure to greater amounts can 
lead to brain damage and death 
as late as 1985 federal health officials reported that a 
bloodlead level of anything less than 25 micrograms per deciliter 
was regarded as safe a 1985 screening program found that 15 
percent of the children checked had elevated bloodlead levels by 
that standard 
but in recent years many scientists have come to believe that 
even 15 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood can have harmful 
longterm effects mitchell said 
last december scientists reported that bloodlead levels of 12 
micrograms were linked to a slight hearing loss in children which 
could cause learning impairment 
the study by the environmental protection agency and the health 
effects research laboratory at north carolinas research triangle 
park also found that same bloodlead level could cause delays of 
up to three months in sitting walking and talking by young 
children 
children with immature bodies and a habit of getting into dust 
dirt and grime are at greatest risk for adverse effects from lead 
poisoning pregnant women also can transmit lead exposures to a 
fetus 
lead residue in soil and dust is still a major problem 
mitchell said thats the one we know less on how to go about 
cleaning it up you cant just pick up all the dirt and cart it 
somewhere 
lead paint in older housing units and lead in the dust and soil 
from past deposits and deterioration will be difficult and 
expensive to remedy the cdc said 
the environmental protection agency is investigating methods to 
remove lead from dust and soil mitchell said 
a threat also remains from walls painted with leadbased paint 
many years ago if they are not either specially sealed or properly 
stripped he said this must be done carefully by experts he added 
the worst thing you can do is just try to sand it off he 
said

chronic fatigue can be as disabling as a heart 
attack but it may stem more from depression and anxiety than from 
any physical cause a new study indicates 
in a report in todays journal of the american medical 
association dr kurt kroenke assistant chief of medicine at 
brooke army medical center at fort sam houston texas said many 
doctors dont take chronic fatigue seriously enough 
such fatigue which he compared to lower back pain can result 
in impairment in daytoday activities resembling that in people 
recovering from a heart attack or suffering from other serious 
diseases 
fatigue tends to be underestimated many times in the 
physicians mind as a minor complaint kroenke said thursday 
fatigue is a symptom that doesnt affect the patients lifespan 
but it causes a lot of disability 
kroenke and his colleagues said 24 percent of 1159 adults who 
answered questionnaires at base clinics in 1986 identified fatigue 
as a major problem 
he and his colleagues conducted further studies on 102 people 
who complained of fatigue lasting at least 30 days but had no 
identifiable illnesses 
fiftyseven of them showed evidence of depression on 
psychosocial and physical tests while 58 of them had scores 
suggesting abnormal levels of anxiety and a total of 82 people 
80 percent of the group had one or both 
in a comparison group of 26 people who had suffered no chronic 
fatigue only three people or 12 percent showed abnormal levels 
of anxiety or depression the researchers reported 
they said a causeandeffect relationship doesnt necessarily 
exist between fatigue and anxiety or depression because fatigue 
could result from an unrecognized illness but the consistent and 
powerful findings on psychological tests combined with an 
absence of significant differences in lab tests between fatigued 
and nonfatigued groups indicate that emotional factors play a 
role in chronic fatigue they said 
therapy for fatigue sufferers could include reassurance 
counseling psychoactive drugs and exercise they said 
the study did not explore the possible connection between 
tiredness and infection with the epsteinbarr virus which causes 
mononucleosis and has been suspected as a cause of chronic fatigue 
but another study in todays journal of the american medical 
association found a test for epsteinbarr virus not helpful in 
determining the cause of chronic tiredness said authors led by dr 
walter hellinger of the mayo clinics facility in jacksonville fla 
they found no significant differences between 30 fatigued 
patients who tested high for levels of a substance indicating the 
presence of epsteinbarr virus and 30 fatigued subjects who the 
test revealed had low levels of the same substance 
one coauthor dr robert van scoy of the mayo clinic in 
rochester minn noted the study did not deal with all tests for 
epsteinbarr but just with the test for the early antigen or 
indicator of the virus 
other researchers had reported in 1985 they found the 
earlyantigen test very useful in establishing the link between 
the virus and chronic fatigue

new jerseys 39yearold law banning 
motorists from pumping their own gas has been overturned by a 
superior court judge who said the safety considerations that led 
to the laws enactment are now invalid 
but judge martin l haines suspended his ruling for six months 
to give the legislature an opportunity to enact regulations 
complying with his decision 
oregon is the only other state that prohibits selfservice 
stations 
proponents of selfservice stations praised the decision which 
was announced thursday they said it could help drive down costs at 
the pump by decreasing labor expenses 
were obviously pleased said john f holtz associate 
director of the new jersey petroleum council which represents the 
states largest oil companies we see it as a victory for 
consumer freedom of choice 
but jerry ferrara executive director of the new jersey gasoline 
retailers association and allied trades inc which represents 
about 3000 service stations in new jersey said he was 
disappointed 
the trade group said such a decision would lead to service 
station layoffs and the closing of gas station repair bays 
the state department of labor has lobbied against changing the 
law citing the possibility of fewer gas station jobs 
other opponents said the change would increase profits of 
gasoline companies by lowering their labor costs 
in his sixpage opinion haines said the law violates the state 
constitution because it exceeds the police power of the legislature 
haines ruling came on a lawsuit filed by kirschner brothers oil 
co inc of haverford pa the company which owns about 20 service 
stations in new jersey claimed the law is antiquated and that 
customers ought to have a choice between self and fullservice 
the 1949 statute enacted primarily as a safety measure was 
affirmed by the state supreme court in 1952 legislators who passed 
the law were concerned that motorists would be in danger if they 
pumped their own gas 
opponents of selfservice stations cite newspaper reports of 
fires and other accidents that have injured or killed motorists who 
were trying to pump their own gas as evidence why the statute 
should remain 
haines ruled june 29 that he couldnt overturn a law affirmed by 
a higher court but kirschner asked that he reconsider and in his 
latest ruling haines agreed 
the principle is that a lower court is bound by precedent in 
this case it does not apply because the facts have changed the 
judge said 
haines decided that safety is no longer an issue and that that 
allows him to reverse his earlier ruling and overturn the state 
supreme courts affirmation 
the testimony before me revealed very different facts 
selfservice stations are at least as safe as fullservice 
stations haines said in a telephone interview 
the lawsuit was filed against the labor department which was 
represented by the attorney generals office becky taylor a 
spokeswoman for attorney general cary edwards said the office had 
not determined whether it would appeal

a jury sentenced a man infected with the aids 
virus to 99 years in prison for sexually assaulting an 8yearold 
girl and then stabbing her 
alphonso percival darden 27 said it was a setup as he was 
led from the harris county courtroom thursday he was watched by 
angry relatives and friends of the victim now 9 and her playmate 
now 10 who also was raped 
although darden was charged in both assaults he was tried only 
in the case involving the younger girl 
authorities revealed that although darden tested positive for 
aids antibodies the parents of the victims were not notified of 
the aids risk for eight months 
the girls testified that darden got into their apartment jan 29 
by posing as a security guard sexually assaulted each of them 
while forcing the other to watch and then stabbed them 
the victims said they escaped further injury by playing dead 
darden said in a statement to police that the girls allowed him 
to enter their apartment and then seduced him 
prosecutor pat kelley said the statement was so preposterous 
and harmful to the defense that he read it to the jury during 
closing arguments 
kelley asked for a life sentence saying it was necessary so 
little girls in the future will be safe 
darden was arrested three days after the attacks state district 
judge michael mcspadden ordered him to take the antibody test and 
said the results would be released to the parents 
a positive result in the aids antibody test means a person was 
exposed to the virus and may be infectious 
police said darden may have raped six other houston girls whose 
parents also dont know darden was infected with the deadly virus 
vague texas laws were blamed for the failure to notify the 
parents about dardens test result judges may order rape suspects 
to be tested for the aids virus but what action is taken 
concerning the results is not clearly defined

the leader of the guerrilla 
movement seeking independence for southwest africa says he 
believes south africa is sincerely committed to ending its rule 
over the territory 
sam nujoma president of the southwest african peoples 
organization made his comments in an interview with the argus news 
service published thursday in the south african companys 
newspapers 
swapo has been fighting since 1966 for independence in 
southwest africa also known as namibia south africa announced 
earlier this month that it would begin implementation of a un 
independence plan for namibia if agreement was reached on 
withdrawal of cuban troops from neighboring angola 
nujoma was quoted as saying his guerrillas will observe a 
ceasefire in namibia starting sept 1 and thereafter will fight 
only in selfdefense 
let us believe that this time the south african government is 
serious he reportedly said 
according to the report nujoma made a major concession by 
saying swapo would not delay the peace process by insisting that an 
independent namibia take possession of walvis bay a south african 
enclave which is only major port serving the territory 
nujoma also was quoted as saying he would not allow the african 
national congress the main guerrilla movement fighting for 
blackmajority rule in south africa to maintain bases in namibia 
swapo is widely considered the likely winner of independence 
elections envisioned under the un independence plan 
nujoma interviewed in zambia was quoted as saying a swapo 
government might adopt a oneparty socialist system if there was 
sufficient public backing but he reportedly said there would not 
be sweeping expropriation of private property 
south african president pw botha in a policy speech thursday 
endorsed the peace initiative but said his government would insist 
that the united nations prove its impartiality before independence 
elections could proceed in namibia

former president ferdinand marcos 
said today he will ask to come home to defend himself when a former 
government minister testifies against him about the awarding of 
allegedly questionable contracts 
on thursday an antigraft court ruled that the ousted president 
had the right to be present when former public works secretary 
baltazar aquino who is not related to president corazon aquino 
gives his deposition 
the hearing nov 7 is not a trial but a perpetuation 
proceeding to take testimony from aquino who court officials say 
is gravely ill 
aquino is to testify about allegedly questionable contracts 
granted to firms during marcos 20year reign under philippine 
law his testimony can be used against marcos at a future trial 
even if the former secretary is dead 
justice augusto amores said marcos could appear personally or be 
represented by counsel and would have the right to crossexamine 
aquino solicitorgeneral francisco chavez said his office believed 
that his marcos personal presence is not necessary during the 
hearing 
marcos told reporters by telephone from hawaii where he lives 
in exile that he had not been informed officially of the thursday 
ruling 
i directed my lawyer to seek the court order for me to come 
home and defend myself in the proceedings i want to represent 
myself said marcos who is a lawyer 
marcos has lived in hawaii since his ouster in a 1986 
civilianmilitary uprising mrs aquino has refused to let him 
return citing security concerns 
but a spokesman for mrs aquino quoted her as saying she would 
respect the decision of the court even if it meant allowing 
marcos to come home 
the court said marcos had the constitutional right to appear 
during the proceedings which cannot be denied to him in the 
absence of more cogent reasons 
marcos has never been formally charged with any criminal 
offense despite allegations of wrongdoing during his time in 
office marcos has previously warned he would dismiss his lawyer 
rafael recto and demand the right to represent himself if any 
criminal charges were filed 
in thursdays ruling the court authorized the philippine consul 
in honolulu to serve notice of the proceedings to marcos and to 
publish the announcement in newspapers there for three consecutive 
weeks 
marcos told manila reporters that his former minister had been 
pressured into agreeing to testify because of his poor health 
last may mrs aquino turned down a request by marcos to return 
here for the burial of his mother josefa who died may 4 
the body of marcos mother remains unburied as his supporters 
agitate for the former presidents return marcos said his mothers 
burial would be my first duty after his return

three soviet sailors said they were tortured while 
taiwan held them in prison for 34 years tass reported but a 
taiwanese official said the sailors requested political asylum and 
were not held in jail 
the official tass news agency said vladimir sablin boris 
pisanov and vladimir kniga returned to the soviet union on 
thursday they were crewmen of the tanker ship tuapse which tass 
said was captured by taiwan july 23 1954 while on its way to 
mainland china with a cargo of kerosene 
the news agency said 29 crew members were released in 1955 and 
five more the following year but that the three were held 
what the soviet seamen had to go through during that time can 
be epitomized only in one word horror tass said 
they were made to look for days at hot white electric bulbs 
wild dances of the prison guards on prostrate bodies of the 
prisoners whose feet and arm joints were squeezed tight tass 
said it gave no details on why the men were detained or what led 
to their release 
tass said the three men arrived at moscows sheremetyevo airport 
grayhaired with worry and grief and were conspicuous because 
of their old clothes and constrained manner 
in taiwan a foreign ministry official speaking on condition of 
anonymity said the three sailors did not spend their years in jail 
he said they requested political asylum in taiwan and were treated 
as refugees 
the official declined further comment 
taiwan newspapers quoting unidentified sources said the three 
sailors lived in a secluded compound guarded by security agents in 
ilan a fishing village 20 miles southwest of the capital taipei 
in april tsai chunghan a parliamentarian of the governing 
nationalist party asked the government to allow the seamen to 
return to the soviet union to visit their families after taiwan 
adopted a policy permitting restricted contacts with communist 
countries 
the late chinese nationalist leader chiang kaishek and his 
supporters fled the chinese mainland to the island of taiwan in 
1949 when communists led by mao tsetung took power the 
nationalists established a staunchly anticommunist government on 
taiwan taiwan has no diplomatic relations with the soviet union

an investigation into the deaths of five elderly boston 
residents during the heat wave found no problems with their 
buildings ventilation system while in illinois the summers 
torrid stranglehold claimed its 40th victim 
twentythree cities in nine states set or tied temperature 
records for the date thursday the national weather service 
reported but forecasters promised that a cooling trend was on the 
way in several areas as residents cast about sometimes 
desperately for ways to beat the heat 
hm hines who owns home ice and coal co in raleigh nc 
said the 105degree weather there was bad enough that some people 
had asked him to dump blocks of ice into their swimming pools 
but its not a good idea hines said somebody jumps in 
and hits that 300pound block of ice its dangerous 
the deaths in massachusetts occurred between aug 4 and monday 
a period when temperatures soared into the 90s state medical 
examiner bryan blackbourne said the clustering of the deaths in the 
same place and during a short time led him to conclude heat was a 
contributing factor four of the victims lived on the top floor of 
the eightstory building 
it was 90 degrees to 95 degrees outside and i would say easily 
100 degrees inside said frank frenna 72 who also lived on the 
top floor of the building but kept cool with a window air 
conditioner 
on thursday a boston housing authority investigation found the 
12 exhaust fans on the flattopped roof were operating properly and 
little variation in hallway temperatures from floor to floor said 
housing authority spokesman bill wright 
illinois authorities said an 85yearold danville man died of 
heat stroke and reported his body temperature was 105 degrees when 
he was found in his home they said he had no air conditioner and 
his doors and windows closed 
in chicago cook county officials said the countys death toll 
from the summer heat stood at 40 most of the victims were elderly 
in peoria meanwhile a daycare center was closed after state 
public health officials found 95degree temperatures indoors 
the prolonged heat and humidity also threatened wildlife 
especially birds on illinois endangered species list 
william e southern a professor of biological sciences at 
northern illinois university said dozens of marshes and wetlands 
in the state have dried up leaving waterfowl nowhere to nest 
breed or feed 
elsewhere the recordbreaking temperatures kept air 
conditioners at full cry and activity at a minimum 
the 105degree reading at raleighdurham international airport 
tied the previous alltime record high set on july 23 1952 
at normally cool grandfather mountain in north carolina the 
mercury hit 81 degrees breaking the old record of 76 set 20 years 
ago 
catherine morton news director for the mountain said the heat

a neighbor was out hiking and decided to take a dip in one of 
the local streams she said when she looked up there was a 
wild bear in the pond up above her everybodys looking to cool 
off 
about half of kentuckys 178 school districts had planned to 
open by weeks end but one school districts superintendent larry 
ryle said if temperatures remain as high ill declare a heat 
emergency and close them down

solidarity leader lech walesa today said 
workers at the lenin shipyard in gdansk will join striking coal 
miners and dockworkers unless the government legalizes the trade 
union a spokesman said 
the unions national executive commission later called on its 
members to support the strikers who have closed six mines in 
southwestern poland and shut down docks and public transportation 
in szczecin according to a labor leader 
they the strikers are fighting for our common cause said 
the commission statement read by jacek kuron a senior union 
adviser in warsaw experience teaches us that only wise social 
pressure can lead the authorities to the road of economic and 
social reconstruction 
the strikes which began tuesday are demanding solidaritys 
legalization higher pay and improved working conditions 
workers at a coal mine in the silesia region today joined the 
strike solidarity spokesman adam kowalczyk said about 1000 miners 
were occupying the 30th anniversary of the peoples poland mine 
other strikers occupied mines in andaluzja moszczenica morcinek 
and two plants near jastrzebie 
walesa told a rally in gdansk that shipyard workers there are 
prepared to stop work monday if the strikers demands are not met 
a union spokesman said 
a strike by workers at the shipyard eight years ago led to 
nationwide labor unrest that spawned solidarity the union existed 
legally for 15 months before being suppressed in a military 
crackdown in 1981 and outlawed the next year 
the gdansk shipyard workers also went on strike in may in 
support of steel workers who had shut down operations at a huge 
steel mill near krakow 
slawomir majewski a solidarity activist in gdansk said by 
telephone that walesas call for a sympathy strike was met with 
applause from 500 workers attending the rally 
majewski said they chanted there is no freedom without 
solidarity 
the strikes began tuesday when miners occupied the july 
manifesto mine near jastrzerbie in southwestern poland 
in szczecin polands second largest port transportation 
workers stopped work thursday joining dockworkers in the city 
the staterun pap news agency estimated that 70000 tons of coal 
had gone unmined as a result of the miners strikes resulting in a 
loss of more than 17 million it has denounced the strikes as 
illegal 
all the mines are in silesia the rich mining region of 
southwestern poland and are major producers of highgrade export 
coal together they employ more than 40000 workers 
solidarity activists estimated that 10100 miners joined the 
strikes they said 5000 strikers occupied the july manifesto mine 
a management spokesman put the july manifesto figure at 800900 
in szczecin 600 bus drivers and other employees of the 
municipal transport service walked off the job pap said the 
walkout stopped normal bus service and forced authorities to lease 
buses to aid stranded commuters 
about 2000 szczecin dockworkers were on strike said solidarity 
spokesman wojciech maziarski 
czeslaw czerwiec a spokesman for july manifesto strikers said 
security forces were hampering efforts by supporters and relatives 
to bring food into the mine 
witnesses described the scene as tense with police still 
holding positions around the mines entrances a regional leader of 
solidarity wladyslaw frasyniuk was picked up by police in wroclaw 
on thursday night union activists said 
miners are paid more than twice the national average but say 
polands 60 percent inflation and nationwide price increases of 40 
percent this year make it impossible to get by 
coal resources are crucial to the nations economy poland is 
the worlds fourthlargest exporter of coal and the mining 
operations are essential to its steel power and shipbuilding 
industries 
the strikes have surpassed the number of actions that broke out 
in april and may the worst labor unrest in the country since the 
1981 martiallaw crackdown however it appeared that a smaller 
number of workers were on strike than in april and may 
the spring strikes in which workers also demanded legalization 
of solidarity and wage increases ended inconclusively after police 
broke up one strike and striking shipyard workers gave up without a 
settlement

khattak told reporters that sabotage was a 1000 percent 
certainty as the cause of the military transport plane crash he 
did not elaborate 
but a government information officer speaking on condition of 
anonymity discounted all speculation on the cause including a 
newspaper report that a time bomb was hidden in a basket of mangoes 
aboard the plane nothing is known yet he said the 
investigators are still at the scene 
rumors about blast cause was the headline in the 
englishlanguage opposition daily the muslim all sorts of 
reports and rumors are circulating in the federal capital in the 
absence of an authentic official regarding the crash it wrote

frontpage headline who eliminated zia and why it said

college placement scores dropped sharply for 
calculus students at the school featured in stand and deliver 
as the youths apparently learned a different lesson real life is 
tougher than the movies 
fiftyfive of the 119 james a garfield high school students who 
took the rigorous mathematics exam in may received a passing score 
of three or higher on a scale of one to five according to college 
board figures which garfield principal maria elena tostado 
provided thursday that represents a passing rate of 46 percent 
down from 65 percent last year when 84 of 129 students passed 
the students celebrated instructor bolivianborn jaime 
escalante was visiting relatives and promoting the movie in his 
native land and could not be reached for comment on the test 
scores but ms tostado said he blamed the lower pass rate on the 
movie 
he said the kids saw the movie so many times they thought 
passing the test was going to be as easy as the movie made it out 
to be she explained he said they didnt know it was so much 
hard work 
in a recent interview with the los angeles times escalante said 
constant interruptions by visitors including vice president 
george bush and his wife barbara were distracting and that the 
kids are paying for it 
harlan hanson director of the advanced placement program for 
the college board said garfield students still did exceptionally 
well compared to students in other schools across the nation 
the school which serves a poor east los angeles community where 
few parents have college educations ranked sixth in the nation 
among all schools that had passing scores on the beginning calculus 
exam and 59th among schools that had passing marks on the advanced 
calculus test 
thats 59th out of several thousand hanson said that is 
by no means anything to be ashamed of what theyve got going is 
great 
the warner bros film starring edward james olmos as escalante 
told the story of the instructors success in teaching calculus to 
average students at garfield in 1982 and their triumph over 
accusations that they cheated on the advanced placement exam 
a passing score on the exam entitles a student to college credit 
at most universities

police said they recovered lostlong photographs 
and documents from the jack the ripper file but the evidence still 
doesnt allow authorities to identify the man who terrorized london 
a century ago 
nevertheless the documents released thursday have helped fill 
in historical gaps and included a chilling letter written in neat 
script and red ink said to be from the ripper according to police 
the rippers five victims all prostitutes fell prey to the 
murderers knife in the seamy east end of london during a nineweek 
period beginning aug 31 1888 most were disemboweled and 
mutilated 
were quite pleased that they are in our possession now 
metropolitan police deputy commissioner john dellow said of the 
photos and documents we cant say at this stage where or how 
they became detached or where theyve been since but they are of 
some interest to us 
they fill in the historical jigsaw of the ripper murders and 
one or two other things dellow told reporters at new scotland 
yard police headquarters but he did not think it brought anyone 
closer to knowing who the ripper was 
the yellowed ripper letter taunts the police for failing to 
catch him 
i keep hearing the police have caught me but they wont fix me 
just yet i have laughed when they look so clever and talk about 
being on the right track it said 
grand work the last job was i gave the lady no time to 
squeal how can they catch me i love my work and want to again you 
will soon hear of me with my funny little games 
dellow said part of the evidence a set of postmortem 
photographs of the rippers victims was given to police last year 
by the family of a deceased policeman it was not known how they 
came into his possession he said 
the second set of evidence appeared more mysteriously in a 
plain brown envelope mailed to police earlier this year 
besides the ripper letter whose contents have been known the 
envelope contained the announcement of a pardon for anyone with 
knowledge of the ripper original postmortem notes on the last 
victim mary kelly and documents about an 1889 crime thought 
possibly to have been the work of the ripper 
dellow said theres been a considerable amount of time spent 
on this to try and identify where documents might have been in the 
last few years but it remains a mystery 
donald rumbelow who has written two books on ripper crimes 
told the associated press the recovery of the evidence was 
important in the sense that a lot of police papers were 
scattered thrown away destroyed so anything which plugs gaps 
is actually doing us all a great service 
he said the documents would be given to the public records 
office where other police files were sent in 1951 
british broadcasting corp television previewed a tv documentary 
thursday that will be shown in september titled shadow of the 
ripper which examines social and historical reasons why the 
spate of crimes became so legendary 
the program is one of several by british and us television 
producers planned to coincide with the centenary other 
ripperinspired entertainment includes walking tours of london 
video games and tshirts

douglas and joan wolff know health care 
costs are skyrocketing but they found a 15543 bill for emergency 
room treatment of wolffs minor scrapes a little hard to swallow 
speaking of swallowing wolff was charged more than 3000 
apiece for the five tylenol capsules he was given 
mrs wolff said thursday that reading the computerized bill 
almost sent them both back to the emergency room 
at first we were shocked we couldnt believe it she said 
then we just had to laugh we knew it had to be a mistake because 
all he did was get cleaned up over there 
st marycorwin hospital administrators acknowledged the 
computer error and assured the wolffs an amended version of the 
bill would arrive soon 
the bill was not without a touch of heart 
the hospital offered the couple a 10 percent discount if the 
bill was paid within 20 days the discount of 1554 would bring 
the total due down to a mere 13989

george bush plunged into his campaign for 
president today proclaiming were going to win this election 
while embattled running mate dan quayle tried to fend off a 
controversy over his military record by making light of it 
appearing with bush at a gop breakfast quayle said i think i 
know howi am to introduce myself 
squaring his shoulders and standing ramrod straight he shouted 
in a clipped voice i stand at attention name dan quayle 
serial number 303 50 4096 indiana national guard six years and 
proud of it 
the audience responded with laughter and cheers 
quayle a conservative senator from indiana has been dogged by 
questions about whether he used family influence to get into the 
national guard at the height of the vietnam war virtually assuring 
he would avoid combat 
bush still buoyed by the rave reviews for his convention 
speech made no mention of the quayle controversy focusing instead 
on his own selfproclaimed underdog campaign for the white house 
now we start now comes the beginning of the end and last 
night there was a shifting of the gears bush said adding that 
he had received a congratulatory telephone call from president 
reagan last night after accepting the gop presidential nomination 
bush said he was convinced that with the party behind him we 
are going to win this election 
he and quayle appeared at a republican national committee affair 
before setting out for quayles hometown of huntington ind where 
a big welcoming rally awaited them 
bush told the republicans you have given us a tremendous 
sendoff i cant think of a better way to get out of town quayle 
got a warm reception at the breakfast receiving even more applause 
than bush 
from indiana bush will point his campaign toward big 
battlefield states for the november election visiting ohio 
illinois washington state oregon california and texas in a 
nonstop blitz through wednesday 
i know that what it all comes down to this election what it 
all comes down to after all the shouting and the cheers is the 
man at the desk in the oval office and who should sit at that 
desk bush told cheering delegates in a convention windup speech 
thursday night 
my friends i am that man bush said 
although speechmaking is not bushs strong suit he delivered 
his remarks with strength confidence and poise 
he hit it he hit it out of the park exulted sen alfonse 
damato rny for me it was a question of survival the 
speech of his life and he did it massachusetts delegate joyce 
hampers called it a grand slam 
nebraska gov kay orr said it was a sensitive speech because 
he was so strong and yet so sensitive he showed that he is attuned 
to the american people i believe he revealed a george bush people 
have not yet seen and had a chance to appreciate 
the main message here said florida gov bob martinez is 
america discovered george bush 
bushs wife barbara delighted the convention with a tribute to 
her husband youve nominated for the presidency a man who is as 
strong and caring and decent as america herself 
yet the controversy over quayle cast a cloud over the 
convention euphoria and the forging of a ticket to challenge 
democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis 
republicans fretted that the furor would undermine gop chances 
of renewing their eightyear lease on the white house 
its not going to help the ticket said illinois secretary 
of state jim edgar a republican i think well just have to wait 
a few days and see how this thing settles out 
lets face it the question is whether a rich kids family got 
him into the guard when other people were getting drafted said 
john decamp a vietnam veteran and gop delegate from nebraska 
some of them like me got shot at a lot and great many of them 
just got shot and killed 
quayle a member of an influential newspaper family refused to 
discuss the matter thursday on the grounds it would detract from 
bushs acceptance speech its the vice presidents night why 
should sen quayle hold some big news conference said press 
secretary sheila tate 
the democratic opposition campaign stepped around the 
controversy over quayle and the national guard but raised questions 
about his qualifications we leave it to the american people to 
judge who made the best decision who made the presidential 
decision said paul brountas chairman of michael dukakis 
presidential campaign the key question is did bush pick the 
person who is best qualified to serve 
quayle had an abundance of defenders most notably george bush 
im proud to have dan quayle at my side bush said giving 
delegates an unmistakable sign that he was not backing away from 
his running mate the declaration triggered roars of approval 
bush recently revived in the polls after a 17point deficit to 
dukakis said there are a lot of great stories in politics about 
the underdog winning and this is going to be one of them i mean 
to run hard to fight hard to stand on the issues and i mean to 
win 
striking back at the theme of dukakis speech in the democratic 
convention last month bush said some say this isnt an election 
about ideology its an election about competence 
but this election isnt only about competence for competence 
is a narrow idea bush said competence makes the trains run on 
time but doesnt know where theyre going 
quayle accepting the vice presidential nomination referred 
only indirectly to the flap surrounding him he mentioned his 
service in the national guard and said i am proud of it 
i am privileged to be the first person of my generation to be 
on a national ticket said the 41yearold babyboomer i dont 
presume to talk for everyone of my generation but i know that a 
great many will agree with me when i express thanks to george 
bushs generation for bringing us an era of peace and freedom and 
opportunity

maung maung an americaneducated 
intellectual and burmas first civilian leader in 26 years is seen 
as a figurehead for military powerbrokers but a leader who could 
calm violent antigovernment protests 
maung maung recently named the countrys attorneygeneral 
today was elected chairman of the ruling political party burmas 
most powerful post and the countrys president 
although maung maung has been closely associated with the 
military dominated political system that activists seek to 
dismantle some analysts say his civilian status and only indirect 
involvement in the recent ruthless suppression of dissent may serve 
to blunt the protest movement 
the 63yearold maung maung has been a journalist lawyer and 
author who joined senior government and party ranks following the 
1962 coup by ne win 
he is described by tzang yawnghwe an author and son of burmas 
first president as one of the few burmese intellectuals who 
sincerely and deeply admired gen ne win 
maung maung served as ne wins personal legal adviser wrote a 
flattering book burma and general ne win about the 
authoritarian leader and was one of the architects of the 
countrys 1974 constitution 
he was born jan 11 1925 and graduated from high school in 
mandalay the former royal capital he enrolled at mandalay 
universitys law school but his higher education was interrupted by 
the outbreak of world war ii and the fight for burmese independence 
from great britain 
maung maung joined the burma independence army a ragtag but 
fiery outfit organized by the leaders of the independence struggle 
known as the thirty comrades the army which included ne win 
in a key leadership role marched into burma from thailand in early 
1942 initially bent on fighting with the japanese against the 
british but later switching to the allied side 
rising from a private to second lieutentant maung maung wrote 
romantically of his army days in a 1974 autobiographical work 
called to a soldier son 
the army has remained my second home in all my wanderings over 
the years maung maung wrote in a passage reflecting his intimate 
relationship with burmas military rulers 
after burma gained independence in 1948 maung maung studied at 
rangoon university describing himself as an eternal student 
maung maung later received a doctorate in international law from 
utrecht university in the netherlands and a law degree from yale 
university where he spent two years as a visiting lecturer in the 
early 1960s 
following the 1962 coup he served as chief justice and in 1971 
became a member of the ruling revolutionary council he was also 
elected to the central committee of the burma socialist program 
party 
after the promulgation of the 1974 constitution which he helped 
write and the replacement of the council by a formal government 
apparatus maung maung became a member of the powerful council of 
state 
the constitution formalized ne wins burmese way to 
socialism an amalgam of socialism buddhist philosophy and 
centralized oneparty rule in its international relations burma 
took a strictly nonaligned stance 
maung maung was elected to the partys central executive 
committee at the third party congress in 1976 and was ranked fifth 
in the party hierarchy he resigned from this committee at the 
fifth congress in 1985 
following the resignation of ne win as chairman july 23 his 
replacement by sein lwin and the subsequent shakeups in both 
party and government ranks maung maung returned to the central 
executive committee 
he was also named attorneygeneral making him only one of two 
civilians among retired or active military officers in the top 
echelons of government the other is education minister kyaw sein 
hugh c macdougall a burma scholar and former us diplomat in 
rangoon said thursday that maung maung had a higher profile abroad 
than inside burma most burmese macdougall said realized a man 
like maung maung was of limited consequence yet from the outside he 
was seen as a unique species a rare civilian among military 
powerbrokers 
i dont see him as anyone likely to take over the real 
leadership macdougall said in an interview 
american burma scholar josef silverstein and several other burma 
experts contacted said they expect a transitional government that 
would try to calm political turbulence and institute some economic 
reforms 
silverstein said that whoever emerged as formal leader would 
probably be controlled by military figures 
but even as a mouthpiece maung maungs ability to deal with the 
current crisis and his appeal among student activists would be 
important 
youth is the time of ideals of anger of energy he wrote 
in the 1974 book how to turn those ideals anger and energy to 
happy and creative purposes is the challenge that society must meet 
all the time

more than 2 years after a flawed 
booster rocket joint doomed the challenger the redesigned part is 
the safest thing on the space shuttle and elated engineers say 
the craft is ready to launch 
meanwhile technicians at cape canaveral fla bolted a clamp 
over a gas leak on the discovery and applied a sealing compound 
today as they worked to clear one of the last remaining hurdles to 
liftoff 
nasa spokeswoman pat phillips said the compound would have to 
set for several hours then workers would run pressure checks over 
the weekend to determine how well the seal worked 
nasa and morton thiokol hailed thursdays performance of a 
deliberately flawed booster in the last in a series of five 
testfirings required before discovery can proceed with its 
scheduled flight this fall 
fantastic it looked really good this is it said john 
thirkill vice president of space operations for the company which 
designs the booster rockets 
were ready to go launch said allan mcdonald morton 
thiokols vice president of engineering after inspecting the 
126footlong booster following the twominute horizontal test 
the test culminated a 470 million effort to correct a faulty 
joint seal that on jan 28 1986 allowed a plume of fiery gas to 
escape triggering the explosion that killed challengers seven 
crew members 
its been a long 2 years we did what we said we were going 
to do and yet it seems like yesterday that it happened said 
mcdonald who had argued before the challenger launch that cold 
temperatures would imperil the craft 
investigators later found that freezing temperatures the night 
before contributed to the failure of one of the three joints used 
to hold the rockets cylindrical cases together 
i think the redesign program went far beyond what anybody 
anticipated it would do as a result of that failure 2 years 
ago mcdonald said we built in a joint that is clearly in my 
mind the safest thing on the space shuttle vehicle 
for thursdays booster test two of the three joints the 
casetonozzle joint and the ignitertocase joint were riddled 
with 14 intentional flaws intended to test them to their limits as 
the rocket burned 11 million pounds of propellant the third joint 
was left unflawed as a comparison 
among the defects were separations in the bonded adhesive 
insulation that helps hold the joints together and channels cut 
with a razor knife that would allow the fiery gas to reach the 
joints middle oring one of three designed to contain heat from 
the burning fuel 
the flaws were introduced to prove the new joints would contain 
the gas despite defects far more severe than any that could escape 
morton thiokols inspection process said company spokesman rocky 
raab 
after the test which sent clouds of dust and smoke billowing 
thousands of feet in the air and shook the ground at an observation 
station 9000 feet away some 300 nasa and company observers 
cheered 
engineers deemed the 20 million test a success after a 
preliminary inspection if the evaluation holds and nasa workers 
can plug the fuel leak in discovery nasa officials will be able to 
set a firm launch date in late september or early october said 
royce mitchell solid rocket motor program manager at the marshall 
space center in huntsville ala 
it looks like just an absolutely great test from top to 
bottom he said the end of september is still within our 
sights 
progress appeared to be made today in fixing the hardtoreach 
fuel leak 
with the discovery upright on its launch pad technicians 
squeezed into the ships cramped cargo bay to attach a 
clamshelllike clamp on a halfinch diameter line that was detected 
leaking nitrogen tetroxide gas more than a month ago 
once the 2inch device was in place the workers began filling 
it under pressure with a sealing compound 
morton thiokol and nasa engineers planned to begin disassembling 
the motor monday and expected final test results within two weeks 
raab said 
mcdonald said preliminary indications were that every safety 
feature intended to prevent leakage had worked and there was no 
immediate evidence of problems in any of four flawed joints 
the data says we got pressure where we wanted to get it and we 
didnt get any pressure where we didnt want to get it and thats 
extremely good news said mitchell 
with the motor testing and redesign which included scores of 
improvements to other components morton thiokol has run five or 
six times the number of tests that were done prior to the first 
shuttle launch and in half the time he said

democratic presidential candidate 
michael dukakis embarking on a whistlestop tour through three 
states declared today that the mission promised by george bush 
missed a page ignoring the federal budget and trade deficit 
threatening the nations economy 
last night we heard a lot of talk about missions dukakis 
said referring to bushs acceptance speech at the republican 
national convention 
he talked a lot about missions but i must have missed a 
page the democratic nominee told a trackside rally in this 
southern illinois town outside st louis we didnt hear a word 
from the republicans about the budget deficit or the trade deficit 
last night or this week and we know why they dont know how to 
deal with them 
dukakis recalled harry trumans love of whistlestop campaigning 
and looked on as his campaign train rolled into the belleville 
station at the end of the morning rally 
after the whistlestop tour through parts of illinois missouri 
and arkansas dukakis was flying late in the day to texas and a 
meeting with running mate lloyd bentsen dukakis planned to 
campaign in tennessee on saturday 
the train trip comes a day after dukakis visited the south to 
reaffirm his commitment to civil rights 
after eight long years this nation needs a president who 
understands that civil rights can never be a sometime thing 
dukakis told black voters at the sixth avenue baptist church in 
birmingham ala 
he all but conceded the black vote to jesse jackson during the 
primary season and held few campaign events designed for black 
audiences 
he also came in for criticism after he spoke at a philadelphia 
miss rally aug 4 on the anniversary of the slaying of three 
civil rights workers there in 1964 but made no mention of the 
episode 
at the birmingham rally he accused the reagan administration of 
ignoring the concerns of black americans he called for improved 
job training prenatal care drug education and housing 
opportunities for minorities 
he also paid tribute to four young girls killed in a 1963 
bombing at a nearby church 
we can turn our heads and wish that hate crimes never took 
place or we can provide the moral leadership we need to banish 
racial and religious violence forever from this country dukakis 
said and that leadership must begin in the white house it must 
begin at the top 
dukakis called civil rights activists true american heroes 
and promised to participate later this month in a march to mark the 
25th anniversary of martin luther king jrs march on washington 
it will be a day for america to march together as one 
community rich and poor young and old black brown and white a 
community of citizens that cares for each other and yes loves 
each other dukakis said former rival jesse jackson is scheduled 
to appear at the march with dukakis 
dukakis was introduced to the congregation by birmingham mayor 
richard arrington a jackson supporter in the primaries 
in mike dukakis we have a man that we can all be very proud 
of said arrington all we have to do is roll up our sleeves 
and go to work alabama is going to be in the democratic column

thousands of people were killed in the 
central african nation of burundi in ethnic clashes this week 
before the army restored order diplomats and opposition leaders 
said 
the government imposed emergency rules to prevent further 
clashes 
the fighting was between the hutu burundis majority tribe and 
the tutsi the minority tribe that controls the military and rules 
the country 
after an abortive coup attempt in 1972 in the former belgian 
colony the tutsi massacred 100000 hutu 
more than 7000 burudians fled into neighboring rwanda to escape 
the killing this week said western diplomats in rwanda the 
diplomats quoted refugees from both tribes as saying thousands were 
killed 
the governmentowned radio monitored in nairobi said today 
that the most recent trouble began sunday in the northern villages 
of marangara and ntega 
some inhabitants of northern burundi belonging to the minority 
tutsi tribe were killed in a selective manner the radio said 
without elaboration it said an overnight curfew was imposed 
throughout the country 
the emergency order also prohibits throughout the country 
meetings of more than five people without government permission it 
said the order was signed by maj pierre buyoya a tutsi who took 
power in a bloodless coup in september 
astere nzisabira burundis ambassador to belgium said in a 
radio and television interview thursday in brussels 
we suspect that some former hutu refugees infiltrated the 
country from some foreign countries they incited the hutu 
population and called on them to massacre the tutsi population 
in an attack on one area in northern burundia on sunday they 
massacred all the tutsis he said he did not provide figures or 
name the area 
the authorities then intervened in a peaceful manner 
nzisabira said but the following day the murders resumed in 
full swing at that stage the army had to intervene and restore 
peace to the country when asked if there were 400 victims he 
said the estimate was much too low 
the hutu people liberation party a movement of exiled 
government opponents accused the military of massacring hutus 
there are thousands of hutus corpses the victims of tutsi 
soldiers floating in lake tanganyika the opposition group said 
there was no way to confirm the claim independently 
burundi with nearly 5 million people crammed into an area about 
the size of maryland is one of africas most densely populated 
countries about 85 percent of its people belong to the hutu tribe 
while the rest are tutsis 
since independence from belgium in 1962 burundi has been 
wracked by protracted factional and ethnic struggles 
for generations the tall lanky tutsi held the short stocky 
hutu in feudal serfdom this led to one of the worst ethnic 
slaughters in independent africa 
in april 1972 the hutu tried to overthrow the government the 
coup was suppressed and the tutsi retailiated by systematically 
killing 100000 hutu including most of the tribes intelligentsia 
in 1976 col jeanbaptiste bagaza staged a bloodless coup 
ousting michel micombero who had sanctioned the hutu slaughter 
bagaza like micombero was a tutsi bagaza was overthrown sept 
4 1987 by buyoya who came to power vowing to end ethnic 
differences

george bushs acceptance speech for the 
republican presidential nomination was rated a home run today 
by republican national committee chairman frank fahrenkopf as the 
new gop ticket was given a warm sendoff by republican leaders 
bush in turn told a postconvention meeting of the republican 
national committee he appreciated the many plaudits he has received 
for the speech including one that came by phone thursday night 
from president reagan 
i just cant think of a better way to get out of town the 
vice president joked as he and his running mate sen dan quayle of 
indiana embarked on the tickets maiden campaign trip 
their first stop was to be quayles hometown of huntington 
ind for a rally the two will campaign in the midwest together 
through sunday when bush will go on alone for another three days 
of campaigning on the west coast 
the vice president gave what many republicans said was the best 
speech of his career thursday night he portrayed himself as not 
the most eloquent and confessed i may be sometimes a little 
awkward 
i am a quiet man but i hear the quiet people others dont 
bush told the final session of the republican national convention 
in a speech that probed a personality he previously had claimed was 
not in focus for the public 
you hit a home run mr vice president you hit a home run 
fahrenkopf told bush 
at todays meeting bush gained effective control over the 
national party for the fall campaign as the committee voted without 
dissent to install fred malek who had been bushs convention 
manager as deputy chairman 
fahrenkopf at bushs request will stay on as chairman but 
with reduced responsibilities as malek assumes command of 
electionrelated activities of the party 
bush told the panel that he received a call from reagan after 
his speechi told him i would do my level best to move forward 
along the lines we talked about last night were going to win 
this election 
now we start now comes the beginning of the end bush said 
last night there was a shifting of the gears 
but added bush im not going to give you the whole load 
after a long night 
in his speech bush talked about his family his values and 
what he called his desire for a kinder gentler nation drawing 
repeated applause from his convention audience 
just as democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis had done 
at his partys convention last month the vice president delivered 
a speech that was better received than even some supporters had 
expected 
a grand slam said massachusetts delegate joyce hampers 
i think he touched all the important bases he needed to 
touch said oklahoma delegate dick freeman 
and even though bushs day of triumph was clouded by questions 
surrounding quayles military service bush declared im proud 
to have dan quayle at my side 
in his acceptance speech which bush had carefully finetuned 
and practiced over the past two weeks with speechwriter peggy 
noonan the vice president sought to portray himself as an underdog 
in his race against dukakis 
there are a lot of great stories in politics about the 
underdog winning and this is going to be one of them bush said 
i mean to run hard to fight hard to stand on the issues 
and i mean to win 
bushs speech was calculated to help him emerge from the shadow 
of president reagan a man to whom bush said he had given absolute 
loyalty over the past seven years and to paint a portrait of 
himself as a man of sensitivity 
those of you who saw the presidents speech this week and 
listened to the simple truth of his words will understand my 
loyalty all these years but now you must see me for what i am the 
republican candidate for the president of the united states he 
said 
bush aides who beforehand had sought to lower expectations 
about the speech said they were delighted with the way it had been 
received 
there was not a single thing he was intending to set out to 
accomplish that wasnt accomplished said rich bond the 
political director of his campaign campaign manager lee atwater 
exclaimed the delegates on the floor were going wild he really 
outdid himself ive never seen him do better 
bush brought laughter from his audience when he joked that his 
wife barbara had found him tired recently while working on his 
speech and had implored him to relax and put up your silver 
foot 
it was a selfmocking reference to democratic keynoter ann 
richards taunt that bush with his privileged family background 
and his tendency to make verbal gaffes was born with a silver 
foot in his mouth 
republicans indicated that they found little evidence of a foot 
in his mouth silver or otherwise in his thursday night 
performance 
it was great said tennessee delegate shirley duer it was 
his finest hour he just couldnt hold back his charisma 
bush who like dukakis is often characterized as lacking a 
strong personality had joked at the start of his acceptance 
speech to be fair to the other side ill try to hold back my 
charisma

110 pounds of explosives in south beiruts neighborhood of 
maamoura the spokesman said 
beiruts independent daily annahar said parliament failed to 
muster the quorum for the expected election of suleiman franjieh on

a confrontational candidate 
the leftist assafir newspaper said the first round of 
presidential elections fell by the american knockout strike 
annahar in an editorial blamed differences between us and 
syrian officials calling the outcome in washingtons favor not 
because it opposes syrias role in lebanon but because it objects 
to the character of challenge that overwhelmed the elections 
process 
the united states expressed regret thursday at the failure to 
elect a president and attributed it to the lack of a consensus 
candidate 
hardline christians opposed to syrias role in lebanon headed 
off the expected election of franjieh a 78yearold maronite 
catholic by preventing the required quorum for the vote only 38 
representatives showed up for the session quorum for electing a

has vowed revenge syria is the main powerbroker in lebanon with 
40000 troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and 
south beirut

the lebanese forces said a paliament member speaking on

nonchristian leaders appealed to israel to intervene in the 
elections but israel said it would not the report quoted uri 
lubrani the defense ministry coordinator of israeli policy in

a bank robber fired the bullet that 
killed an 18yearold woman hostage one of three people who died 
in a 54hour crime spree across west germany and the netherlands 
officials said today 
west german media said if police had moved sooner they may have 
prevented the deaths two bank robbers and a woman accomplice who 
hijacked a bus at one point with 30 people aboard left a trail of 
terror across germany and the netherlands before police captured 
them thursday in a shootout near bonn 
hostage silke bischof 18 squeezed next to one of the gunmen 
with a pistol pointed at her head had spoken to reporters thursday 
while the getaway car was parked in downtown cologne she said she 
was being treated well but that she feared someone would be killed 
if police moved in to end the hostage crisis 
two hours later she was killed in the gun battle with police 
who set off flash bombs to stop the getaway car on a busy highway 
the other hostage in the car also a woman was injured 
one of the gunmen hansjuergen roesner 31 was shot in the 
thigh said reinhard schmidtkuentzel a spokesman for the north 
rhinewestphalia interior ministry the other gunman dieter 
degowski 32 and marion irma loeblich the accomplice were not 
injured he said all three were under arrest 
we are 99 percent certain that degowski fired the shot that 
killed silke bischof he said we know one of the two gunmen 
killed her 
earlier a 15yearold italian boy held hostage and a police 
officer died in the bizarre drama reports said the boy died trying 
to protect his sister 
did they have to die shouldnt the police have moved in much 
earlier the masscirculation bild newspaper asked in a 
frontpage editorial 
police gave the bank robbers two getaway cars and hundreds of 
thousands of dollars in efforts to persuade them to free their 
hostages and surrender the shooting sprees and car chases left at 
least five people injured 
police should have acted much more decisively and swiftly 
said heinz guenther a lawmaker with chancellor helmut kohls 
christian democratic party 
a random telephone poll by the respected wickert institute in 
tuebingen said 93 percent of the respondents could not understand 
why police did not act sooner to end the situation 
eightynine percent of the 1708 people questioned said they 
believed the top statelevel politicians responsible for law and 
order should resign because of the incident no percentage of error 
was given 
but law officials such as peter mueller police chief in the 
northern port of bremen defended their actions 
mueller rejected suggestions that sharpshooters should have been 
used to kill the bandits while the drama was being played out in 
his city 
there was not one moment when sharpshooters could have been 
used because the bandits never let themselves be exposed without 
others around them mueller said 
but the leftistleaning frankfurter rundschau daily newspaper 
noted no policemen were in sight when the gunmen hijacked the bus 
rarely have tv pictures shown a more helpless government than 
they did on this night in bremen the newspaper said in an 
editorial 
journalists were criticized for conducting onthescene 
interviews with the bandits giving the gunmen a nationwide public 
forum reporters crowded around one of the armed bandits as he gave 
interviews in bremen and cologne 
the bandits were able to find out through information obtained 
from journalists that they were being followed said herbert 
schnoor interior minister of north rhinewestphalia state schnoor 
did not elaborate 
he also blamed the news media for the bandits refusals to take 
up direct contact with police while using journalists to relay 
their demands instead 
the german journalists association urged reporters to never 
allow yourselves to become tools of criminals 
the crime spree began with a bank robbery tuesday in gladbeck 
50 miles north of cologne the gunmen escaped with two bank 
employees and 227000 in a car provided by authorities police 
provided the bulk of the money 162000 to try to ensure the 
hostages safety 
in bremen 135 miles northwest of gladbeck the bandits 
accompanied by the accomplice commandeered a bus with about 30 
hostages on wednesday police seized ms loeblich the accomplice 
at a rest stop 
the frankfurtbased abendpost newspaper today quoted police as 
saying a gunman then pulled 9yearold tatlana de giorgi off the 
bus and threatened to kill her it said her brother 15yearold 
emanuele de giorgi rushed to protect her and was shot to death 
police then let the woman go and she got on the bus which drove 
across the border into the netherlands 
authorities said an officer died in a crash pursuing the gunmen 
most of the hostages were set free near the dutch border town of 
oldenzaal authorities said the gunmen their companion and two 
women hostages got into a highpowered bmw sedan provided by police 
and raced back into west germany where they were ambushed

the sister of american hostage terry 
anderson protested new demands outlined by the captors of her 
brother and called them unreasonable in a statement published today 
also today the beirut weekly ashshiraa said the release of the 
british hostages was imminent but said the release of other 
hostages would take more time the report quoting an unidentified 
west beirut leader said two separate negotiations to free the 
hostages are under way 
the report in ashshiraa which broke the story of us secret 
arms sale to iran in november 1986 could not be independently 
verified many of its previous stories about the hostages have not 
been accurate 
it said the kidnappers sought money and and at the same time 
economic military and political conditions set by iran it did 
not elaborate 
peggy say andersons sister said i think it is grossly 
unjust for you to hold terry anderson for ransom that includes what 
amounts to a complete peace settlement in the entire region and the 
end of centuries old hostilities the text of mrs says message 
was published by beiruts two leading newspapers annahar and 
assafir 
in the past three and a half years i have tried my very best 
to pressure my government to negotiate for terrys release and the 
release of the other hostages mrs say wrote 
you have now presented new demands which are impossible for me 
to put forth to my government wrote mrs say who lives in 
kentucky 
anderson 40 is the chief middle east correspondent for the 
associated press and has been held longer than any of the 18 
foreign hostages in lebanon he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
the proiranian islamic jihad or islamic holy war which holds 
anderson and american hostage thomas sutherland released a 
statement thursday that set four demands for the release of the 
captives 
two of the demands were new the unconditional withdrawal of all 
the israeli forces and their christian militia allies from south 
lebanon and us compensation and aid for the reconstruction of 
warravaged south lebanon and beirut 
the group also demanded the release of all lebanese and 
palestinian mujahedeen or holy warriors from prisons in 
christian east beirut as well as in israel and israels 
selfdesignated security zone in lebanon israel and allied 
militiamen of the south lebanon army control a 10miledeep enclave 
in south lebanon to guard against crossborder guerrilla forays 
unlike many of its previous communications the shiite moslem 
faction did not specifically ask for the release of 17 suspects 
held in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies in 1983 
but the sweeping statement about prisoners seemed to incorporate 
this demand 
islamic jihad has admitted holding anderson and sutherland 56 
acting dean of agriculture at the american university of beirut 
sutherland of fort collins colo was abducted june 9 1985 
britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held by 
proiranian islamic fundamentalists anglican church envoy terry 
waite journalist john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan a belfast 
man with dual british and irish nationality whose release is also 
sought by the irish government 
the foreign office says it also seeks word on alec collett a

a woman was convicted of voluntary 
manslaughter for shooting to death her second husband 20 years 
after she admitted shooting to death her first husband 
a jury deliberated two hours wednesday before convicting hazel 
allison 47 in the jan 11 shotgun death of eddie boyd allison 
47 her husband of 17 years 
mrs allison of clover had testified that she had been abused 
by allison and shot him in selfdefense 
judge hubert long sentenced the woman to 30 years in prison the 
maximum sentence she must serve at least 10 years before becoming 
eligible for parole 
jurors who could have found mrs allison guilty of murder 
seemed stunned to learn after issuing their verdict that mrs 
allison had killed her first husband billy byers johnson in 1968 
we all had a feeling that something was being held back but 
we didnt know what it was the herald of rock hill quoted an 
unidentified juror as saying 
long explained that mrs allisons history was withheld during 
the trial because of state trial rules limiting the use of prior 
criminal records 
deputy solicitor larry grant said mrs allison pleaded guilty to 
manslaughter in the 1968 case she was sentenced to a twoyear 
suspended prison term and placed on probation for three years 
she claimed selfdefense that time also grant said in both 
cases she said she and her husband had begun arguing after the man 
returned home from hunting and that she then shot him 
in offering mitigating circumstances to justify a lower 
sentence assistant public defender roberta wright commented she 
is of course a widowshe also argued that mrs allison 
suffered a series of physical blows of physical abuse 
grant however argued that mrs allison gave no warning 
none didnt say a word just shot him and therefore was 
disqualified from a selfdefense acquittal

berlin philharmonic conducter herbert 
von karajan suffered blood circulation problems and was unable to 
conduct tonight at the annual salzburg cultural festival 
organizers said 
in a statement issued to news organizations festival organizers 
said extreme climatic conditions gave the 80yearold conductor 
a massive circulatory weakness of a dangerous extent 
festival spokesman hans widrich said von karajan was resting at 
his home in anif a salzburg suburb on doctors orders 
asked whether the maestro was conscious widrich said of 
course he asked that the press statement about the cancellation 
be read to him 
he cited the great heat which causes problems for many people 
above all for those who are not that young any more 
secondly it is very hot in the festival hall and there is no 
air conditioning in the orchestra pit it is for that reason that 
the doctor did not allow mr von karajan to conduct mozarts 
opera don giovanni tonight 
widrich said organizers were confident von karajan who ranks 
among the worlds top conductors would be able to direct scheduled 
concerts with the berlin philharmonic in salzburg aug 27 and 28 
he also expressed some hope that von karajan might conduct at 
least one of two other don giovanni performances scheduled for next 
week when the weather is expected to be cooler 
von karajan the director for life of the the berlin 
philharmonic and salzburgs second most famous son after mozart 
has conducted regularly at the salzburg festival since 1948 
he has been in frail health after years of illness he also has 
had trouble walking to the podium because of serious back problems 
organizers said von karajans longtime assistant bruno weil 
would direct the mozart opera at the salzburg festival house

blindly fulfilled inhumane instructions the communist party 
daily pravda reported today 
mikhail s solomentsev a member of the ruling 13member party 
politburo detailed some of the commissions work in a lengthy 
interview published on the newspapers front page 
the commission he heads was established at a party central 
committee meeting in october 1987 for further examination of 
materials connected with the repressions that took place in the 
1930s1940s and the early 1950s 
those dates refer to the 29year dictatorship of josef stalin 
accused by western historians of being responsible for the deaths 
of up to 20 million people 
many people are guilty of the abuses some of them were named 
some not solomentsev told pravda the measure of the guilt of 
every one of them will be determined 
after stalins death in 1953 soviet leader nikita s khrushchev 
launched the first review of the repressions but solomentsev said 
the work was not completed and did not cover abuses committed 
before 1934 
he said the commission has at its disposal all materials 
contained in the soviet archives and will complete a thorough 
review of the historical records that detail stalins actions he 
appealed to the public for information that might help the inquiry 
solomentsev said 636 people had already been cleared of crimes 
by the commission because accusations against them were unfounded 
and that many other cases are still under review 
we are equally interested in the fate of prominent leaders of 
the party and the soviet state and the rank and file citizens 
workers peasants office workers party government and economic 
functionaries intellectuals he said 
among stalins victims were hundreds of thousands of crimean 
tatars and ethnic germans who were accused during world war ii of 
collaborating with nazi occupiers 
stalin also led the brutal drive for collectivization of 
agriculture in the 1930s when peasants who refused to leave their 
land for state farms were shot as examples to others and hundreds 
of thousands perished in the famine years that followed 
the personal guilt of stalin and the people closest to him 
before the party and people for the mass repressions and 
lawlessness is dreadful solomentsev told pravda 
but the guilt of the leaders does not relieve of 
responsibility the voluntary executors those directly involved in 
the infringement of socialist law those who supported and blindly 
fulfilled inhumane instructions committed outrages he said 
solomentsev said the burial places of many of stalins victims 
may never be discovered a soviet newspaper however reported this 
week that the graves of 500 of the victims had been discovered near 
minsk the byelorussian capital 
among those whose names have been cleared this year of criminal 
charges made against them by stalins prosecutors are prominent 
bolsheviks nikolai bukharin grigory zinoviev and lev kamenev each 
was a major figure in the 1920s and a rival for the power that 
stalin took for himself 
they and many other prominent figures either were shot or died 
in prison camps during stalins purges of the 1930s 
solomentsev said an investigation also had been launched into 
the assassination in december 1934 of leningrad party leader sergei 
kirov 
kirov was a popular party figure who opposed stalins rule some 
western historians believe stalin was responsible for kirovs 
death but accused other opponents of the crime in an effort to 
destroy them 
western reference books say more than 100 people were executed 
after being accused of involvement in a plot to kill kirov

burmas attorney general maung maung 
today was named president and chairman of burmas ruling party the 
useducated lawyer the nations first civilian leader in 26 
years immediately called for reforms 
but student leaders rejected the choice of maung maung who is 
seen as a figurehead for the military and called for a nationwide 
strike to press for an end to oneparty rule said a western 
diplomat in rangoon the capital 
students led bloody street demonstrations on aug 812 that 
ended the 17day rule of maung maungs hardline predecessor sein 
lwin 
burmas official radio rangoon said maung maung 63 was 
selected during emergency meetings of the central committee of the 
burma socialist program party and of the peoples assembly burmas 
parliament the radio was monitored in bangkok 
in a radio speech maung maung later urged the party central 
committee to fulfill the peoples aspirations as soon as possible 
and as much as possible 
we need to review ourselves because the violent 
demonstrations showed that consultation with the people became 
weakened he said 
he said the severe storm of protests hit the nation while 
fundamental economic and political reforms were being debated 
maung maung said it has been almost a year since former party 
chairman ne win spoke of the need for economic reform he said some 
youths have been deprived of opportunities to study and that 
efforts are being made at educational reforms 
the western diplomat said by telephone from rangoon students 
have called for a nationwide strike on monday theyre agitating 
for abolition of oneparty rule the more militant student 
leaders are disappointed 
he said students called for the strike in leaflets circulated 
during a peaceful rally in front of rangoon general hospital 
japans kyodo news service reporting from rangoon said 15000 
people took part in the rally 
kyodo also said 100000 people marched in the northern city of 
mandalay the countrys secondlargest city in the second straight 
day of mass prodemocracy demonstrations kyodo said provincial 
government workers walked off of their jobs to join the 
demonstration the citys population is 600000 
maung maung is one of only two civilians in the top ranks of the 
government hierarchy 
his selection was a surprise most burma watchers had predicted 
the new party boss would be chosen from among the clique of active 
and retired top military officers who supported former leader ne 
wins system of rigid socialist economics strict military control 
and international isolation 
maung maung is considered a relative moderate and thought more 
acceptable than other figures to burmese who took to the streets in 
waves in the past two weeks to topple sein lwin and press demands 
for an end to a quartercentury of military dominated 
authoritarian rule 
the government said 95 people were killed last week in battles 
between security forces and antigovernment demonstrators but 
diplomats said hundreds may have been killed 
after burma gained independence in 1948 maung maung studied at 
rangoon university he later received a doctorate in international 
law from utrecht university in the netherlands and a law degree 
from yale university where he spent two years as a visiting 
lecturer in the early 1960s 
after the 1962 coup he served as ne wins legal adviser he was 
elected to the party central committee at the first party congress 
in 1972 and in 1974 became a member of the state council the 
highest state organ 
in a 1974 autobiography to a soldier son he wrote 
admiringly of the military but also praised the ideals of youthful 
activism he is seen as a figurehead for military powerbrokers but 
a leader who can calm the protests 
maung maung was elected to the partys central executive 
committee in 1977 and was considered the countrys fifthranked 
leader he resigned from that post in 1985 and later became 
attorney general 
the only other civilian in the militarydominated government is 
education minister kyaw sein 
a western diplomat in rangoon said the capital was calm but that 
military forces were deployed around the pyithu hluttaw the 
parliament building in northwestern rangoon 
sein lwin is a former army general criticized for his brutal 
suppression of dissidents he replaced ne win who took power in a 
1962 coup and ruled the country for 26 years until his resignation 
since sein lwins ouster various activist groups have 
circulated leaflets and posters presented formal statements to the 
government and held street rallies to demand greater democracy 
brang seng leader of the kachin guerrilla army and vice 
president of the national democratic front of 10 rebel groups told 
kyodo today that the front will join the students and citizens 
fighting in the movement for democracy to establish a provisional 
government for national reconciliation 
as long as the oneparty dictatorship continues we will 
continue our struggle against whoever is chosen as the next 
leader he was quoted as saying 
protesters demands include a multiparty system economic 
reforms release of political prisoners and restoration of student 
organizations 
under ne win burma was transformed from one of southeast asias 
wealthiest countries to one of its poorest rivaled only by 
communistruled laos and cambodia rampant inflation food 
shortages and other economic hardships fueled popular resentment 
against the government

democratic vice presidential nominee lloyd bentsen 
said today that republicans put on a convention for the far right 
in new orleans a mardi gras for the moral majority 
the hard right drove the republican agenda bentsen told a 
news conference as he neared the end of a nineday campaign trip to 
his home state where he planned to welcome running mate michael 
dukakis tonight to the texas hustings 
what we saw was the republicans putting on a convention for 
the far right bentsen said they had a mardi gras for the 
moral majority 
bentsen was asked about a report in todays washington post that 
his blind trust invested in his sons business after being steered 
there by the senator 
he said he reported the trusts investment in his sons company 
frankly i didnt have to report it bentsen said 
he said his wifes position as a trustee on a mutual fund 
affiliated with the manager of his trust in no way compromised the 
blind trust no not at all absolutely not he said 
he said his wife was one of the directors representing the 
stockholders and not the management its almost an adversarial 
relationship he said 
bentsen told reporters his blind trust was approved by the 
senate ethics committee 
earlier bentsens spokesman jack devore said the trust was 
handled properly and the senator did not know about the sons 
investment until after it was done 
bentsen began the day by contrasting his running mate with the 
opposition ticket of bush and dan quayle 
mike dukakis has reached out to the center and he is saying to 
democrats who voted for ronald reagan come home bentsen said 
in an interview on abctvs good morning america 
he said i thought george bush had a wellcrafted speech and 
that he did a good job delivering it but he said bush did not 
note that the national debt and the trade deficit have soared 
during the eight years of the reagan administration evidence of 
what bentsen called a creditcard mentality 
dukakis and bentsen arranged to meet here tonight for a 
fundraiser and then visit the lbj ranch and president johnsons 
widow lady bird on saturday the joint appearances were designed 
to underline the importance democrats place on the lone star state 
which bush also claims as home 
bentsen flew to texas a week ago and has been crisscrossing the 
state on behalf of dukakis selling the ticket to skeptical texans 
most of whom are more conservative than the massachusetts governor 
the texas senator planned to continue that effort today before 
supporters in wichita falls and during a visit to a texas 
instruments plant in sherman before returning at days end to 
dallas 
bentsen began thursday in tyler in east texas explaining to his 
longtime senate supporters why he was seeking both reelection to 
that seat and the vice presidency 
he met in kilgore with oilmen a conservative group and 
promised that he would continue to fight for them in washington as 
vice president with the same verve as he has in the senate 
he also spoke before the east texas regional development group 
an audience of more than 500 businessmen and women mostly 
republican 
they were attentive and they were polite i think we made some 
headway he said after the appearance to win texas 29 electoral 
votes bentsen says democrats who voted for reagan must come 
home to the democratic party 
when he flew to dallas at days end bentsen met the other end 
of the political spectrum one that might find him a tad too 
conservative both bentsen and the jesse jackson supporters he 
talked with said they were pleased with the encounter 
it went quite well bentsen said although problems 
remained in campaigns there are always those things we did 
very well 
john wiley price a dallas county commissioner and a jackson 
supporter who walked out of the democrats convention in atlanta 
said bentsen went a long way toward alleviating his concerns about 
black participation in the campaign and bringing him on the 
bandwagon 
sen bentsen agreed they cant win without jackson so he is 
going to make sure these needs are going to be discussed price 
said 
bentsen planned to leave texas on saturday flying to florida 
for a democratic party dinner before returning to washington

they were relegated to supporting roles but 
some lesser known republican faces were given convention exposure 
this week and can be counted among the partys leaders for the 
future 
names like phil gramm who described himself as doing the 
lords work in the devils city and olympia snowe who wielded 
the gavel with humor and aplomb and tom kean who scored the 
democrats for pastel patriotism 
political conventions are expected to make and end political 
careers and this one made dan quayle what george bush said he was 
one of the partys rising young stars 
unless that is he proves to be a shooting star 
if quayle meets the challenge of his lofty new role the young 
and conservative junior senator from indiana may pose a roadblock 
for some of the partys other aspirants to the mantle of ronald 
reagan 
but while quayle was battling to prove his worthiness against a 
barrage of questions about his military record and experience some 
republicans who were passed over for the vice presidential 
nomination can already be counted among the winners and losers of 
the convention 
gramm the texas senator who only five years ago was a democrat 
and is widely assumed to have presidential aspirations is a 
possible inheritor of leadership of the republicans right wing 
he was given a prominent spot at the convention delivering the 
speech that placed bushs name in nomination gramm did a credible 
job delivered some good lines and avoided the pitfall of 
democratic nominator bill clinton the arkansas governor who talked 
on and on in introducing michael dukakis 
kean the new jersey governor and convention keynoter had to 
contend with a minor protest by republican ideologues who objected 
to such a prominent role being given to someone who didnt share 
their opposition to abortion 
kean preaches what is called the politics of inclusion and 
bringing minorities into the party in republican party politics 
his future depends in part on the partys willingness to accept 
moderates 
i thought tom kean did a good job said dan casey executive 
director of the american conservative union a conservative 
organization there was no down side at all 
kean battles an image problem that results from an aristocrats 
accent but he told a superdome filled largely with affluent whites 
that the party of abraham lincoln must reach out to the 
illschooled illtrained or illhoused 
snowe the maine congresswoman was part of a parade of 
republicans afforded a moment on the platform she demonstrated 
that the party has a bench deep with potential leaders 
john mccain brought the convention crowd to its feet for the 
first standing ovation of the convention a firstterm senator from 
arizona who is solid with the partys conservative wing mccain 
recalled his 5 years spent in a north vietnamese prison 
pat robertson who as a candidate never lived up to the 
expectations some had for his religious right movement gave a 
hohum speech but he helped himself among the partys 
establishment by maintaining a low profile and playing the good 
soldier 
some who were passed over for the vice presidential nomination 
looked like winners just because they were considered sen pete 
dominici of new mexico who has pushed his party to deal with the 
deficit and sen alan simpson of wyoming whose selection likely 
would have angered conservatives 
the convention had its losers too 
jack kemp is the most obvious the new york congressman spent 
eight years running for president and lobbied hard to become bushs 
running mate now he is giving up his congressional seat 
we believe with all our hearts that there is a role to play 
for jack kemp and our ideas in the future of the republican 
party kemp said others arent so sure 
bill bennett former education secretary and a big draw on the 
gop fundraising circuit gave a flat speech in a monotone that the 
delegates barely listened to 
former un secretary jeane kirkpatrick who electrified the 
1984 gop convention by condemning the san francisco democrats 
stuck to her style but her words seemed to get lost in the 
cavernous superdome 
sen bob dole of kansas gave a crowdpleasing speech but his 
remarks about the vice presidential selection process while he 
was being selected out sounded sour dole complained that the 
selection process in which the bush campaign tried to heighten 
suspense by keeping the nominees name secret was demeaning 
the superdome where the convention was held itself was a 
loser all were delighted at the spacious accommodations until 
the convention began on television it was fine but inside 
delegates could hardly hear so much for conventions on football 
fields 
and there was another loser atlanta 
yes the republican convention was mostly dull but new orleans 
can throw a party that the democrats who met a month ago in 
georgia could only imagine

new orleans let the good times roll when the 
republican national convention came to town and it should reap the 
benefits of a week of national exposure for 20 years local 
officials said 
new orleans has never looked better louisiana has never 
looked brighter said jim bob moffett head o the fortune 500 
company freeportmcmoran and a key convention fundraiser 
the city public and private rolled out its plushest carpet 
for the gop visitors with sumptuous parties native cuisine 
riverboat rides and gov buddy roemer reminding everyone the state 
was polishing its tarnished image 
sooner or later the message was going to come across that new 
orleans is not strictly a party town or a place for good food and 
music said david jones president of the new orleans chamber of 
commerce we are starting to do the right things to make this a 
viable economic center 
local boosters raved about the success of the fourday 
convention which ended thursday and by most accounts the 
complaints were minimal 
but then new orleans handles mardi gras every year with 20 times 
as many visitors and a different type of crowd police said 
at mardi gras its a party crowd and there are a few more 
untoward incidents said new orleans police capt john hughes 
it was very good as far as were concerned 
suffocating humidity and 90degree temperatures made it too hot 
to misbehave hughes said 
new orleans subtropical weather and the sound system installed 
by the republicans in the giant louisiana superdome seemed to cause 
the most dissatisfaction 
technicians began adjusting the system after sen barry 
goldwater the gops 1964 presidential nominee said he couldnt 
hear a word of president reagans farewell speech monday 
the complaints diminished during the week but they didnt go 
away 
it is not the superdome system dome manager bob johnson was 
quick to point out of the special sound equipment installed by the 
republican convention team 
there was at least one report of hotel hell from the new 
york delegation who found parts of their ceiling on the floor and 
uncooperative sinks tubs and toilets 
im used to roughing it but when you cant flush the 
toilet said sen alfonse damato letting his sentence finish 
itself i just couldnt work without the basic needs being 
fulfilled 
and some of the more conservative delegates were not charmed by 
new orleans tolerance for the weird the drunk and the sexy 
now that we have visited sodom where is gomorrah one 
washington state delegate was reported asking 
but others were seduced by the history the easygoing attitude 
and the mighty mississippi 
even streetwise cab drivers were on their best behavior this 
week lots of pleases and thank yous complete with accurate meters 
and air conditioning systems that work the daily oklahoman noted 
our goal was to put together one of the most successful 
conventions in history said jones the chamber president 
lt gov paul hardy said he was hard pressed to find anyone who 
wasnt enamored of the french quarter the streetcars and the 
oaklined avenues 
i dont believe that we could have spent 1 billion in 
advertising and reaped the benefits equal to the fantastic free 
press the free media we are receiving hardy said 
it will probably have gains for louisiana for the next 20 
years said mervin trail a new orleans businessman and another 
key fundraiser

about six tons of magazines letters and 
free samples some more than three years old were found in the 
home of a mail carrier but his customers apparently never missed 
the missing mail officials said 
ive seen this type of thing before but never of this 
magnitude said postal investigator richard jordan right now 
were overwhelmed 
authorities responding to a tip from a neighbor raided the 
carriers home monday and found the undelivered mail some of it 
badly deteriorated and infested with bugs piled in the house 
packed into a storage shed and littering the surrounding woods 
it was believed to be one of the largest mail thefts in us 
history said a postal investigator who didnt want to be 
identified because he works undercover dean nichols a postal 
inspector in birmingham ala said he was unsure whether it was 
the largest because the postal service does not keep records of 
mail thefts 
investigators used a frontend loader to scoop up the mail 
hauling away several truckloads by thursday but authorities 
could give no precise estimate of how much had been seized except 
that it had filled 16 3by3by4feet deep postal bins 
postal bins hold about 250 pounds of mail meaning that roughly 
two tons had been hauled off 
jordan said about 32 bins full of mail or four tons remained 
to be collected today about 500 to 600 pieces of firstclass mail 
were among the items found 
we amazed ourselves when we found more today he said 
thursday after a trek in the woods surrounding the house examples 
of the bulk mail included sweepstakes envelopes and diaper samples 
the name of the mail carrier was not released but he works out 
of the pensacola office and lives in milton he has been placed on 
administrative leave pending charges officials said 
the pieces of firstclass mail are being retained as evidence 
investigators are sorting the remaining bulk mail and contacting 
each recipient to see if they still want it delivered the rest 
will be destroyed 
we hate to destroy it but some is just undeliverable its 
something i never thought id see jordan said 
pensacola postmaster ben jasek said he was surprised the 
carriers 500 rural customers didnt notice any mail missing the 
post office never received any complaints to tip them off he said 
this is a fluke all i can say is that rural carriers are kind 
of their own entity he said

sir frederick ashton one of the worlds greatest 
ballet choreographers died in his sleep the royal opera house 
said today he was 83 
ashton who received a knighthood in 1962 for his work died 
thursday night at his country house in the suffolk region 
northeast of london said margaret skeet spokeswoman for the opera 
house parent company to the royal ballet 
no cause of death was given 
we have lost one of the worlds greatest choreographers 
said sir john tooley outgoing director of the royal opera house 
he was nothing less than a genius and his contribution to the 
development of ballet in this country is beyond words 
ashtons creations ranged from the balletcomedy a wedding 
bouquet to cinderella in 1948 the first threeact ballet 
created for a british company he also created dances for operas 
films musical comedies and revues 
nobody could create a more touchingly tender love duet than 
he said a press release issued by the royal ballet with whom he 
worked for more than two decades including seven years as director 
ending in 1970 
but there is something shakespearian about the way he could 
move within a single work from sweet lyricism to knockabout comedy 
or delicately barbed wit it said 
as well as a knighthood ashton was awarded a companion of honor 
in 1970 the order of merit in 1977 and admission to the french 
legion of honor in 1962 
born in guayaquil ecuador in september 1904 to british 
parents he grew up in peru after seeing anna pavlova perform in 
lima in 1917 he fell in love with ballet and wanted to become a 
dancer 
but he wasnt able to begin studying the art until years later 
when he took up ballet classes against his familys wishes after 
his graduation from an english private school 
his first commission was for a small ballet called a tragedy 
of fashion created for a revue in 1926 
in 1931 he did his first work for dame ninette de valois 
beginning a longtime working relationship with her and the company 
she fostered which grew into the royal ballet 
they drew inspiration from english painters and music for a 
style marked by poise purity and freshness the royal 
ballet statement said 
his bestknown ballets include romeo and juliet ondine 
marguerite and armand and daphnis and chloe 
asked once what was the inspiration he told the times of 
london i dont know i am fairly religious i rather put 
myself in the hands of a superior power i am almost like a 
wireless radio 
he was unmarried and the ballet statement did not mention 
survivors 
no date for services was immediately announced

interest quayle voted with the losing side when the senate by a

senators generally are required to vote on each issue facing the 
senate although a member may asked to be excused however senate 
rule xii paragraph 3 states a member nothwithstanding any 
other provisons of this rule may decline to vote in committee or 
on the floor on any matter when he believes that his voting on 
such amatter would be a conflict of interest 
in the book senate procedure page 1137 under the newly 
amended rule xii relative to senators not having to vote when a 
conflict of interest is involved the senator from north carolina 
mr helms on a vote in 1980 on an anmendment involving 
broadcasting companies declined to vote since he owned stock in a 
broadcasting company 
quayles vote on the newspaper exemption occurred july 21 1987 
shortly before the senate passed a bill overhauling us trade laws 
sen tom daschle dsd offered an amendment exempting 
newspapers from the import fee that would be used to pay special 
unemployment benefits and other assistance to us workers and 
companies harmed by imports 
since 1913 newsprint has been dutyfree daschle told the 
senate to impose a duty at this time would be a terrible 
precedent they are dependent upon the importation of a 
significant amount of newspring it would have a devastating 
effect 
sen john heinz rpa called the proposed exemption clearly 
a specialinterest amendment and said the newspaper industrys 
case for such a break is no better than anyone elses if we 
exempt the publishers heinz added other industries will have 
to make up that lost revenue 
heinz disputed newspaper industry estimates that the new fee 
would cost newspapers 40 million a year he said a 4 million 
estimate would be much closer to reality since the trade bill 
limited the amount of trade adjustment assistance that could be 
paid and thus the amount of import tax that could be imposed 
quayle did not speak on the amendment sen bob packwood 
rore quickly moved to table it and the senate agreed by the 
6929 vote 
quayles democratic opponent for the vice presidency sen lloyd 
bentsen of texas also voted for the newspaper exemption but as 
far as can be determined bentsen has no financial interest in any 
newspaper 
the 1987 trade bill eventually was vetoed by president reagan 
for other reasons the revised version that congress recently sent 
to the president and still is awaiting his signature requires 
negotiations with trading partners leading to a small fee on 
imports 
the president would have two years to negotiate a fee agreeable 
to all trading partners if the negotiations fail the president 
would have to impose it unilaterally or tell congress why not 
congress then could pass legislation imposing the fee

the number of americans infected with the aids 
virus may be twice the federal estimates and infection among the 
heterosexual population may be three times as high according to a 
report released today by the hudson institute a privatelyfinanced 
research organization 
kevin r hopkins a hudson institute mathematician said a study 
using more sophisticated techniques than are used by the centers 
for disease control shows that as many as 3 million americans may 
be infected with the human immunodeficiency virus which causes aids 
the high estimate by the cdc which is the prime federal agency 
monitoring the spread of aids is that about 14 million are 
infected with the virus 
a best guess at the range of total infections as of yearend 
1987 was from 19 million to 3 million persons with the 
likeliest range between 22 million and 26 million people the 
hudson study reported 
over half of the cases are among homosexual men hopkins said 
but estimates the number of heterosexuals infected by the virus may 
be three times higher than the cdc estimate 
the institute estimates that 850000 to 14 million 
heterosexuals are infected with the hiv virus and that 200000 to 
500000 of this number are heterosexuals who dont use drugs 
there are vastly more heterosexuals infected today said 
hopkins a break out into the nonmonogamous population is 
unavoidable 
the cdc has estimated that the aids virus has infected only 
80000 to 165000 of the nondrugusing heterosexual population 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a 
virus that can be spread through sexual contact through the 
sharing of needles such as in drug abuse through infected blood 
transfusions or organ transplants and from birthing mother to 
child 
hopkins said the hudson institute aids estimates differ from 
those of cdc because different computer models were used and 
because more sophisticated statistical analysis techniques were 
applied to the model 
were all in a guessing game hopkins admitted cdc is 
trying to do its best the main conclusion is that we cannot be 
complacent about his disease 
as of aug 8 1988 aids had been diagnosed in 70208 americans 
of whom more than half or 39620 have died since june 1 1981 
according to the cdc no one is known to have recovered from aids 
the hudson study concentrated on the projections of those now 
infected with hiv but who have not progressed to aids which is 
the end stage of the infection aids is known to develop from three 
to eight years after infection persons infected with hiv are 
capable of spreading the virus before they actually develop aids 
for this reason experts are attempting to estimate the rate of 
infection in order to gauge the future size of the epidemic

singer john denver who has sought 
unsuccessfully to be a passenger on the us space shuttle has 
asked the soviet union for a ride aboard its mir space station an 
industry magazine reported friday 
aviation week amp space technology said denver had requested 
transportation to mir aboard one of the soyuz spaceships that 
regularly carry crews to and from the orbiting station 
the soviets the magazine said responded with two 
conditions they told denver they would charge him 10 million for 
the ride and that he had to get permission from the us government 
the state department took its customary cautious approach 
advising denver it was taking no position on the matter 
effectively putting it back into the hands of the soviets 
aviation week said 
the magazine quoted an unidentified american official as saying 
we very carefully did not endorse his going but at the same time 
we cant prevent us citizens from going to exotic places 
denver has been a guest of nasa at several space shuttle 
launches and has asked several times over the years for a shuttle 
ride saying he wanted to compose in orbit a song about space

wilmer grier is spending her days in court 
defending her client in a mobrelated drug and racketeering trial 
but shes spent the last few nights in a federal jail 
us district judge richard owen cited ms grier for contempt 
for refusing to appear in court wednesday when she was treated at 
a hospital for injuries suffered in a minor traffic accident 
according to court transcripts he ordered her to spend seven 
nights behind bars 
the judge said ms grier had been late to court repeatedly a 
claim she disputed and said he wanted to guarantee her presence 
at the trial of her client timothy smith smith and four other 
people are charged with racketeering and distributing heroin 
owens action was an insult ms grier 47 said thursday 
i didnt have any credibility with the judge maybe because im 
black 
ms grier said she was dragged briefly by a taxi wednesday when 
her backpack got caught in the door she went to a hospital and 
told the judge by telephone that she was not coming to court 
because she could not maneuver her crutches 
according to the transcript unsealed thursday owen also asked a 
nurse at the hospital about the lawyers condition ms grier then 
went home instead of to court us marshals took her to court 
owen known for strictness in his court stressed that ms grier 
had refused to adhere to an order to come to court he cited 
repeated lateness and ordered her detention so i know where you 
will be 
this has been a very difficult trial its i guess affected 
all of us owen said in court wednesday 
ms grier told owen on wednesday that she felt jinxed by the 
whole case everyday something is happening to me with this case 
and i cant get finished 
but the judge said he wondered whether this is some effort to 
get this jury to the point where it is going to give up whether 
this is something that is in your makeup that i dont understand 
the case is in summation

a county judge who had been barred from handling 
juvenile court cases because of improper contacts with delinquents 
was found dead in the courthouse of an apparently selfinflicted 
gunshot wound officials said today 
king county superior court judge gary m little knew that the 
seattle postintelligencer was publishing a frontpage story today 
reporting that little used his influence to have sexual relations 
with young men in the 1970s a friend of the judge said 
camden hall a lawyer and longtime friend of littles said the 
judge called him twice thursday threatening suicide hall said he 
tried to get help for little whose body was found by a janitor 
about 10 pm in an eighth floor hallway 
a 38caliber handgun and a note were found with the body said 
police sgt don cameron who declined to divulge the contents of 
the note the onepage handwritten note was found on a hallway 
bench and it gives intent said vaughn van zant an 
investigator with the county medical examiners office 
the cause of death was apparently a selfinflicted gunshot wound 
to the head said kevin gow a medical investigator in the 
examiners office an autopsy was to be performed later today 
little 49 a former assistant state attorney general announced 
last month he would not seek a third term on the bench 
acknowledging that innuendo about his work with teenage boys 
was the reason 
in 1982 the state commission on judicial conduct privately 
admonished little for improper contacts with youths who had 
appeared in his courtroom such as buying them clothing and books 
court rules bar such contacts the commissions action was not made 
public until 1985 little was reelected in 1984

after the first call threatening suicide hall called the county 
crisis center and was referred to mental health professionals he 
said the professionals told him the best thing to do was to try to 
have little committed

they arrived at the courthouse after the shooting 
he said he felt hed been hounded by the press and he just 
couldnt take it anymore hall said 
officials at lakeside school where little worked said he left in 
1973 on good terms and that they were unaware of any illicit

the death of president zia ulhaq 
the army general who governed this nation for 11 years has 
prompted muted mourning and uncertainty for the future 
in the modern capital of islamabad and the old adjoining city 
of rawalpindi there is little outward sense of mass bereavement 
our religion says that when any moslem dies all the people 
feel sorry said a grayhaired shopkeeper it is better not to 
say more the world goes on 
zia who seized power in a bloodless coup ruled as a military 
man although sometimes in conjunction with civilian governments 
and he inspired more respect than love 
many people when asked what his death meant to them seemed 
incapable of articulating emotions instead they responded with 
recitations that the president had been killed perhaps by a bomb 
as the countrys newspapers have speculated officially there has 
been no word on the cause of the inflight explosion that killed 
zia and 29 others wednesday 
life in islamabad and rawalpindi without zia conveys little more 
than a mood of propriety flags fly at halfstaff and police and 
soldiers line major streets and the route of saturdays funeral 
procession 
the sense of dignity without emotion fits neatly in the twin 
cities where street signs exhort people to smile give a 
child a book and in case of forest fire please ring 827227 
in the southern port city of karachi core of the political 
opposition led by benazir bhutto people handed out candy a 
traditional gesture of celebration in this islamic country 
most of the public tears seemed confined to a crowd of women who 
gathered outside zias residence in rawalpindi on thursday and to 
about 50 male relatives and associates who met the coffin that 
brought zias remains to islamabad airport thursday night 
but people often spoke of their late presidents strength 
zia was trying to make pakistan a very strong country high 
school student moin qazi said as he pushed his bicycle down a 
street in rawalpindi his death is a great loss 
moin the 17yearold son of an army general was scornful that 
any civilian opposition leaders would emerge to lead the country 
benazir bhutto is just a foolish woman he said 
at islamabads aabpara market nazir sheik presided over his 
familys photo shop gen zia was very expert in dealing with 
india the 22yearold man said referring to the neighbor that 
has fought three wars with pakistan since the two countries were 
partitioned upon gaining independence from britain in 1947 
an army captain watching security preparations at islamabads 
faisal mosque where zias funeral will be conducted saturday 
said it is difficult to imagine pakistan without zia he was 
such a strong man the bearded officer asked that his name not be 
used 
but there was a tinge of emotion at zias gravesite on the 
grassy lawn in front of the mosque 
i am digging this grave with my heart 23yearold abdul 
khalek said as he leaned on his shovel to rest for a few minutes

a forest and grass fire that killed cattle 
and destroyed 10 houses grew by 7000 acres overnight in the 
mountains southeast of helena despite the efforts of 1700 
firefighters 
it sounded like a train said barbara duffy whose cabin and 
30 cows were destroyed by flames when the warm springs creek fire 
quadrupled in size thursday when we came out of the garage we 
saw this fireball coming at us through the trees 
elsewhere helicopters today ferried firefighters into a wyoming 
wilderness area near yellowstone national park to fight an 800acre 
blaze and a helicopter involved in firefighting efforts in 
wyomings bighorn national forest crashed today killing one and 
injuring three others firefighters also battled fires in 
california idaho utah and other western states 
the warm springs creek fire in the elkhorn mountains grew to 
27000 acres during the night but on two fronts it took turns that 
could help suppress it said fire information officer bob krepps 
said today 
westerly wind blowing at about 20 mph late thursday pushed the 
fire back into itself on its western perimeter depriving it of 
new fuel and relieving a threat to the 500 or so residents of the 
saddle mountain subdivision about 10 miles southeast of helena 
krepps said they had been warned that they might have to evacuate 
on the fires eastern edge the flames moved out of the forested 
high country and onto grassland thats a real benefit to us 
also krepps said because of the lighter fuel 
although the flames advanced east to within about three miles of 
the tiny community of winston about 15 miles southeast of helena 
theres good fire line in over there krepps said i think 
theyre in pretty good shape this morning 
at least 40 people remained out of their homes while volunteer 
fire crews helped cut fire lines around houses and other structures 
west of winston and near montana city a small town a few miles 
south of helena authorities said 
fire officials said they were optimistic about a cooling trend 
predicted for the weekend 
krepps said four homes and six summer cabins were burned early 
thursday when the fastmoving warm springs creek took an unexpected 
turn toward the north 
before the fire ballooned wednesday night about 1700 
firefighters had it 95 percent contained the blaze began aug 9 
when a fourwheeldrive vehicle caught fire eighty percent of the 
fire has burned on the helena national forest 
hundreds of miles away in southeastern montana about 1000 
firefighters hoped to tighten the noose today around fires that 
have burned 13600 acres of timber and grassland near lame deer 
most of the three fires surrounding lame deer a town of about 
600 people on the north cheyenne indian reservation were contained 
by fire lines thursday night said fire information officer ron 
smith 
in northcentral montana nearly 950 firefighters were battling 
a 4800acre fire on the rocky boys indian reservation containment 
was predicted by saturday night 
in northwest wyoming yellowstone officials closed the norris 
campground on thursday as a precaution due to a 69000acre fire 
five miles to the south 
the fire also forced the closure again thursday of a 14mile

another park campground remained closed because of a nearby blaze 
while a third was shut to provide a campground for firefighters 
about 272000 acres of the nations oldest park have been 
damaged by flames in recent weeks 
in nearby teton wilderness today 200 firefighters ferried by 
helicopter battled an 800acre wildfire using pumps and hoses to 
suck water from streams and ponds to spray on the flames

children of migrant farmworkers who 
often lag behind schoolmates because of continual uprooting were 
given the satisfaction of seeing one class project through this 
summer training to be astronauts 
eighty children from grades five through seven spent six weeks 
on an imaginary space shuttle mission at greenfield community 
college using an elaborate imitation spaceship with a cockpit 
experiment station bunks galley and hygiene room all hooked 
up by computer to a ground control center 
these students had a goal for the first time in some of their 
lives said martha kelliher who teaches fifthgraders in the 
massachusetts migrant education program 
when i first explained it they were awed a lot of them had 
never worked with a computer some cant speak english there was a 
lot of hesitation and doubt in their eyes she said friday 
by the time the program ended this week however the children 
had learned enough astronaut lingo and computer tricks to take the 
imitation spaceship on fourhour flights conduct studies on acid 
rain from outer space radio an emergency message to mission 
control that their teacher needed her lunch and finish the job they 
had started 
the space shuttle simulator was built nearly 10 years ago by 
students at the twoyear state college to teach appreciation for 
living with limited food water and trash disposal and give 
students a better understanding of their role as global citizens 
said greg vouros who runs the orbiter program at greenfield 
vouros was looking for young wouldbe astronauts to train under 
a grant from the state department of education when he met with 
david almeida who runs the migrant education program in western 
massachusetts 
almeida said the programs aim is to give remedial help to 
youngsters after school and during summers school so they dont 
fall so far behind that dropping out of school and working as 
nonskilled laborers are their only options 
many of the children are plunked into one school system after 
another as their parents follow harvests up and down the east 
coast the children may change textbooks and friends several times 
a year almeida said 
the space shuttle project he said showed them the importance 
of goals and teamwork math and english and opened vistas of 
opportunity 
they realized if i cant read i cant follow the 
instructions on the screen and we may crash ms kelliher said 
they also learned that if one person didnt know his job the 
whole success and life of the team was at stake 
julio correa an 11yearold mission commander whose father 
works in connecticut tobacco fields said he learned respect for 
the nature and for other people and being a part of a team it was 
kind of fun 
ms kelliher said her class had prepared for the flight by 
borrowing library books on space listening to a nurse explain how 
to take temperatures blood pressure and pulse rates and inventing 
tools they might need on a flight 
vouros said children aged 9 through 13 are ideal for the 
simulator flights 
they are sophisticated enough to handle them and willing to 
lose themselves in the dramatic play he said when you get to 
the ninth grade youre too cool to play the role in an uninhibited 
fashion 
even though some children spoke little english other children 
would translate i never noticed that we had any problem in 
communication he said

the bus that stops in rushville five days a 
week is a lifeline for 72yearold evelyn trenkle 
but she and the other 1200 residents in the northwestern 
nebraska town face losing their bus service and joining the ranks 
of thousands of rural americans who live beyond the scope of 
scheduled bus rail and air service 
were just so isolated out here i dont know what wed 
without it said mrs trenkle 
rushville near the south dakota border is 400 miles from omaha 
and 30 miles from chadron the nearest community of any substance 
arrowblack hills stage lines runs the bus that stops in 
rushville two years ago the company announced it would 
discontinue the route from rapid city sd to omaha because of 
low ridership said jim maly schedule manager 
the bus is still running because towns along the route joined 
with the state and federal governments to work out a subsidy but 
the bus could be threatened again when the subsidy runs out maly 
said 
the isolation of rural america concerns not only residents but 
also the us department of agriculture 
too often if you live in a rural community the bus may no 
longer come to town nor may rail or air service be available 
said martin fitzpatrick jr administrator of the agriculture 
departments office of transportation 
many rural communities are now truly at the end of the line 
with limited access to any form of public transportation 
fitzpatrick said 
his office along with the us department of transportations 
urban mass transportation administration and the united bus owners 
of america have spent a year studying rural transportation 
problems 
that work will culminate with a threeday conference beginning 
monday in omaha to develop a plan to reconnect rural america 
among those scheduled to speak are gov kay orr sen larry 
pressler of south dakota and rep virginia smith of nebraska 
during the last year a new effort has begun to reconnect 
rural america we hope this national meeting will consolidate those 
efforts for the future fitzpatrick said 
weve learned that while service to rural communities indeed 
has been lost in many cases there are a variety of ways rural 
transportation needs can be met he said 
for example flexible pointtopoint routes tailored to 
particular passenger needs are beginning to take the place of 
traditional fixedroute systems also rural passenger needs 
sometimes can be dovetailed with the shipment of goods in sparsely 
populated areas 
steve sprague the united bus owners vice president for 
government affairs said the conference should provide a blueprint 
for both governmental agencies and transportation providers 
we want to try to pick and choose the most appropriate way 
communities and states can begin to build that intercity 
transportation service sprague said when we walk away from 
omaha we will know hopefully what are the best patterns to 
pursue 
while sprague concedes that many see the 1600 bus owners and 
operators represented by his group as part of the problem he says 
the associations participation in the yearlong study proves the 
group wants to be part of a solution 
federal local or state subsidies for private carriers serving 
rural america can help solve the problem he said 
there is a middle ground somewhere between full public and 
fully private transportation that has not been identified for rural 
communities he said 
but even with boosts like the subsidy provided to the rushville 
bus route service is far from guaranteed there the 200000 
subsidy is a fixed sum and arrowblack hills will have to 
reevaluate continuing the service when the money runs out maly 
said 
while many stranded by the loss of bus service stay home when 
theyre lonely or ill mrs trenkle says she would move to a town 
with bus or rail service 
i dont believe i would stay here i just couldnt she 
said i wouldnt be able to get anywhere there are a lot of 
people like me who are elderly and cant drive too far who need the 
bus service

the government put more police in 
the streets friday on the eve of the 20th anniversary of the 
sovietled invasion that crushed alexander dubceks liberal 
prague spring of 1968 
official media concentrated on criticizing the former communist 
party chief and other sponsors of reforms that resembled those now 
pursued by mikhail s gorbachev but did not please the kremlin of 
the time 
police ranks also were reinforced in the slovak capital of 
bratislava where dubcek lives the disgraced former leader now 
67 said he would spend the anniversary quietly with his 
grandchildren 
dubcek refused an interview earlier this week when asked by 
western reporters they will be angry with me he said of the 
authorities who gave him a minor forestry job in bratislava in 1970 
and have kept him under close watch 
whatever the police presence czechoslovakias dissident 
movement was at work 
leaflets stuffed in some city mailboxes urged citizens to gather 
in wenceslas square scene of protests 1968 on saturday night for 
a discussion of the invasion 
spokesmen for charter 77 the human rights group planned to 
deliver a statement to the soviet embassy at noon saturday 
demanding a full account of the invasion from the kremlin they 
also planned to lay flowers at the embassy in memory of 
czechoslovaks killed in the invasion and ensuing street violence 
most of the 155 million czechoslovaks fell silent after the 
invasion of aug 2021 1968 and few are expected to show their 
feelings openly this weekend about the events of a generation ago 
this anniversary is not being celebrated government 
spokesman miroslav pavel said we see no reasons to celebrate 
authorities expelled about 20 west europeans most of them 
italians who hung a banner across wenceslas square on thursday 
demanding freedom in czechoslovakia and withdrawal of soviet troops 
on thursday and friday state television broadcast a 90minute 
film showing dubcek and other former leaders expelled from the 
party with him in a purge of half a million members overseen by 
milos jakes the current party chief 
it reflected the line taken by staterun media in recent weeks 
that changes were needed in 1968 but dubcek and his allies were 
weak leaders who permitted events get out of control 
several academics and district party leaders were shown 
recalling the events of 1968 and blaming dubcek and other leaders 
who enjoyed enormous popularity for precipitating the invasion 
we hoped that a process of democratization would take place 
that would open room for positive changes writer miroslav hlatky 
said 
most people lived in the euphoria of those days and expected 
just a socialist communist system but all of a sudden the 
process of democratization was strangled by anticommunist forces 
and the human face of socialism they were wearing changed into a 
hard and evil mask 
hlatkys allusion was to dubceks stated wish to create 
socialism with a human face 
gorbachevs adoption of the phrase and his own zeal for reform 
have prompted speculation moscow would change its stance on the 
invasion whose official reason was to stop a counterrevolution 
that might take czechoslovakia out of the warsaw pact 
although soviet historians have made clear there is more 
official sympathy for dubcek than before kremlin spokesman gennady 
i gerasimov reiterated this week that the soviet party 
respects the official czechoslovak judgment that the invasion 
was necessary 
on friday the soviet news agency tass said the soviet unions 
intervention saved the country from irresponsible leadership and 
possible brutual repression of communists 
antisocialist forces taking advantage of political 
irresponsibilty and opportunism of a part of the leadership of the 
communist party of czechoslovakia of that time made an attempt 
to tear czechoslovakia away from the socialist community the 
tass commentary said the friends and allies of socialist 
czechoslovakia could not remain indifferent 
czechoslovak media repeated that official view for the past 
month but milan matous a party theorist wellknown for justifying 
the invasion conceded in two articles that a deeper and more 
critical evaluation might be made 
pavel the government spokesman indicated to reporters thursday 
a commission of soviet and czechoslovak historians might be formed 
in an interview friday with the associated press however he said 
that was just a private idea it is not under discussion 
cautious economic reforms have been made since jakes assumed the 
leadership last december but political change seems distant

west lanes bowling center gave rick l 
gibbons a check for 100 when he rolled a perfect game last 
september but now gibbons is suing west lanes because of the way 
it takes care of its lanes 
gibbons of council bluffs iowa filed suit thursday in douglas 
county district court alleging that a maintenance mistake kept him 
from receiving certification of a perfect score from the american 
bowling congress 
the bowling centers owner said hes befuddled by the lawsuit 
which seeks unspecified damages and court costs 
i just think its wild said coowner bud simmonds i 
really didnt think hed go so far as to file a suit 
gibbons bowled a perfect score of 300 during league play on 
sept 8 then applied for recognition by the american bowling 
congress but his application was denied after a certified 
inspector from the omaha mens bowling association found that west 
lanes had dressed its lanes in violation of national 
regulations the lawsuit says 
dressing is the daily application of mineral oil to bowling 
lanes which can affect the path a ball takes down the lane 
west lanes used the shortdistance dressing method in which oil 
is applied along the first 24 feet of the 60foot lane 
but the inspector found that oil had been applied on too much of 
the lane 
somehow the machine that hae massine and then with marie 
rambert who encouraged him to try choreography and helped him win 
his first commission a small ballet called a tragedy of 
fashion created for a revue in 1926 
in retirement ashton continued to remain active as a consultant 
and visitor to both the royal ballet and its touring sister 
company the sadlers wells royal ballet 
he never really stopped said mary clarke editor of the 
monthly the dancing times he could always come up with a pas de 
deux or a party piece for a special occasion he was adored by 
everyone 
asked once what was the inspiration for his inventions ashton 
replied i dont know thats fairly difficult to say i am 
fairly religious i rather put myself in the hands of a superior 
power i am almost like a wireless radio 
ashton was unmarried and the royal ballet said it did not know 
if there were any survivors no funeral arrangements were announced

new york citys schools chancellor is telling 
schools to consider getting rid of time clocks that many teachers 
cite as hated symbols of their lack of professional status 
chancellor richard green has drafted a memorandum directing the 
principals and staffs of each of the citys 974 public schools to 
submit plans by dec 1 for keeping track of teachers hours without 
time clocks he said in an interview thursday 
im very pleased said sandra feldman president of the 
united federation of teachers the union representing the citys 
61000 teachers 
i have called around the country i dont know of any other 
school district that has them said feldman 
new york city teachers have been punching clocks since the early 
1900s when reformers thought schools should operate on a factory 
model for the sake of efficiency she said 
the citys teachers are required to be in school at least six 
hours 20 minutes the length of a school day 
greens predecessor former chancellor nathan quinones had sent 
out two more weakly worded memorandums at the unions urging to 
persuade schools to end time clocks 
but more than 800 city schools still have them according to 
feldman 
weve had teachers docked for being a minute late and the 
time teachers spend after school doesnt count she said 
greens directive differs from earlier ones in imposing a 
definite deadline it also orders principals to collaborate with 
teachers 
green said he was asking principals to work with their staffs 
to determine how they can account for attendance in the absence of 
time clocks or whether they want to sustain them they will make 
the decision building by building and no one will ever be able to 
say they didnt have a chance to participate in a workrelated 
issue that i think is symbolic 
alternatives to time clocks include signout sheets and time 
cards

the pentagon today acknowledged that the crew 
of the uss vincennes made several mistakes in shooting down an 
iranian airliner but concluded that the ships captain based on 
what he had been told did what his nation expected of him 
the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff adm william crowe 
said that an investigation of the july 3 tragedy found that capt 
will c rogers iii and his crew were acting under severe stress as 
the airliner approached them during a surface engagement with 
iranian gunboats 
the vincennes mistook iran air flight 655 for an f14 fighter 
and shot it down killing 290 people 
the commanding officer never received te clear evidence that 
he thought he needed to establish that the iranian aircraft had not 
come to participate in the ongoing surface action crowe told a 
news conference 
defense secretary frank c carlucci told reporters he had 
decided to withdraw a letter of censure proposed for lt cmdr 
scott lustig the operations officer who was faulted for not 
adequately verifying information he was passing to the captain 
carlucci said that president reagan had received the report and 
concurred in its findings reagans spokesman marlin fitzwater 
who was with the vacationing president in california said in a 
statement that this tragic accident was ultimately the result of 
the conflict between iran and iraq which we now hope is on the 
verge of settlement 
crowe cited these mistakes 
a conclusion that the civilian airbus was descending rather 
than ascending as it approached the vincennes 
a report that the jetliner was transmitting a signal 
identifying it as a military aircraft 
a report that the plane was outside a commercial air corridor 
crossing the persian gulf 
crowe said that taken individually the mistakes were not 
crucial to the decision to fire two standard missiles at the 
airbus 
even cumulatively they do not change the picture in a 
decisive way said crowe 
our past experience in the gulf the intelligence available to 
the ship and the rules of engagement all supported such a 
judgment by the ships captain crowe said 
i believe that given the operating environment capt rogers 
acted reasonably and did what his nation expected of him in defense 
of his ship and crew crowe said 
the main recommendation of the investigation was that no 
disciplinary action should be taken against any us naval 
personnel associated with this incident said crowe 
despite some shifts the findings of the final report were 
largely consistent with the pentagon statements on july 3 in 
emphasizing the stressful combat environment in which rogers and 
his crew operated 
the report offered a wealth of new detail the officers in the 
command and control center could hear gunfire from the surface 
battle outside including the noise of bullets pinging off the 
metal hull the ship was heeling at a 32degree angle as the 
airliner approached making it difficult for the men to stand 
causing objects to fall off flat surfaces and lights to flicker 
i dare say that it would be hard to even have this press 
conference under those conditions much less reach critical 
decisions on a number of targets during a very short timeframe 
said carlucci 
in all crowe said rogers faced a series of problems he could 
not control or discount in the seven minutes between the planes 
departure from an iranian field and the destruction of the airbus 
crowe laid much of the blame for the tragedy on iran 
an examination of the events on 3 july leads quickly to the 
conclusion that iran must share responsibility for the tragedy and 
the investigation so found he said 
by any measure it was unconscionable to ignore the repeated 
warnings of the united states and permit an airliner to take off 
from a joint militarycivilian airfield and fly directly into the 
midst of a surface action in the strait of hormuz which the 
iranians themselves had initiated he said 
the report exonerated the sophisticated aegis radar and tracking 
system aboard the vincennes one of the navys much lauded 
ticonderogaclass guided missile cruisers 
carlucci said a number of changes have been proposed as a result 
of the investigation including modifying video displays to display 
an approaching objects distance and altitude revising the process 
by which an object is designated as a fighter aircraft and 
subjecting the operators of the aegis system to psychological 
testing to ensure they are ready for combat 
much of the controversy surrounding the tragedy has centered on 
discrepancies between pentagon statements on the day of the 
incident and bits of information that surfaced as rear adm william 
fogarty conducted his investigation 
our earlier washington briefings on the accident were based on 
information received from the ship shortly after the action some 
of which were found by the investigation to be incorrect crowe 
said 
adm fogartys investigation also revealed that mistakes were 
made on board vincennes that day that in itself is not surprising 
to anyone who understands the stress of hostile action in a life or 
death situation said crowe 
one mistake involved transmissions by a device aboard the 
airliner known as the identification friend or foe iff 
transponder which pentagon officials earlier said sent signals in 
what is known as mode 3 used by military and civilian aircraft as 
well as in mode 2 reserved for warplanes 
the iff emission from flight 655 was mode 3 which a 
commercial aircraft normally uses the vincennes also detected a 
contradictory mode 2 military squawk and mistakenly concluded that 
it came from flight 655 that detection did lead the vincennes 
officers to declare the contact an f14 much as been made of 
that error said crowe 
but he added it was not a crucial element in capt rogers 
decision to fire military aircraft in an attack run can disguise 
their identify using civilian iff signals or on ocassion no iff 
signal at all 
significantly iranian f4s operating against us units on 18 
april were squawking only mode 3 the civilian code he said 
crowe also noted that questions have been raised about the 
ships initial report that the aircraft was outside the air 
corridor the report was wrong 
but crowe said that whether or not an aircraft is in a 
commercial air corridor is a peripheral point to a commanding 
officer engaged in a hostile action particularly when the corridor 
covers the engagement area the persian gulf is blanketed by 
commerical air routes they cover over 50 percent of the gulf 
rogers told investigators that he concentrated on the position 
of the airliner threetofour miles off the median and 
interpreted that as unusual said crowe 
perhaps the most puzzling mistake was the ultimate call of 
flight 655 as descending instead of climbing said crowe 
that too was wrong said crowe but it is impossible to 
say how it affected rogers decision because he received his last 
altitude reading after he had already received permission to fire 
and 20 to 30 seconds before he actually did so

president reagan is planning a 
white house meeting with american indian leaders who protested his 
remark at the moscow summit that the united states perhaps should 
not have humored the indians the white house said friday 
the american indian action group said presidential spokesman 
marlin fitzwater indicated thursday that reagan would make good 
on his offer to meet with american indian people 
deputy white house press secretary bob hall confirmed friday 
that fitzwater told the group that the presidents staff had been 
told to meet with the indians to determine a date and time for the 
meeting 
the indian group which had previously announced plans to rally 
and walk to reagans mountaintop ranch north of here saturday said 
in a statement it had made a commitment to the demonstration 
and would proceed with it 
hall said the stafflevel meeting probably would be held in 
santa barbara while reagan is vacationing at the ranch the meeting 
in washington will take place some time after reagan returns to the 
white house on sept 6 he said 
on may 31 during his moscow summit talks with soviet leader 
mikhail s gorbachev reagan told moscow university students 
maybe we made a mistake in trying to maintain indian cultures 
maybe we should not have humored them in wanting to stay in that 
kind of primitive lifestyle maybe we should have said no come 
join us be citizens along with the rest of us 
congress granted american indians full citizenship in 1924 it 
was not until 1948 that a court decision gave them full voting 
rights in arizona and new mexico in local and state elections 
reagans remarks outraged indian leaders the president invited 
them to meet with him at any time but the american indian 
action group said he failed to respond to letters and telephone 
calls from indian leaders 
during his administration reagan has never met with indian 
leaders the group said the remarks he made in moscow were his 
first reference to american indians in eight years 
the group said about 200 indians were expected to gather at 
refugio state beach on saturday and walk to the ranch 
the white house described weather at the ranch as sunny and warm 
and said the president was continuing with his usual routine of 
paperwork wood chopping and horseback riding 
he plans to travel to los angeles on tuesday for a fiveday 
stay stopping en route at the marine operations building of the 
port of long beach to sign legislation intended to reduce us 
trade deficits 
he also plans to attend a fundraising lunch in irvine calif 
for republican sen pete wilsons reelection campaign

new york legally prohibited a child prodigy who 
graduated from a florida law school at age 16 from taking the bar 
exam and practicing law in the state until he is 21 a federal 
judge has ruled 
however in the case brought by stephen a baccus now a 
19yearold lawyer in miami us district judge gerard l goettel 
declared unconstitutional a state provision requiring an aspiring 
attorney to be 18 before entering law school 
simply put we think the prospective mozarts of the legal 
profession deserve better the judge wrote in a ruling made 
public friday mozart was composing music by age 5 
while their entrance to the legal profession may be legitimately 
delayed by an age requirement prodigies should not be punished 
because they by virtue of their precociousness were able to 
pursue those rigors at an early age goettel wrote 
baccus said by telephone from miami that he was pleased with the 
ruling affirming his education but disappointed that the provision 
keeping him from taking the bar exam was upheld ive already 
been practicing law for two years so why are they keeping me from 
joining the bar 
baccus said he and his 26yearold law partner still planned to 
open an office in new york to specialize in computer and 
entertainment law as soon as they could afford it 
he said he had not decided if he would appeal the decision but 
would seek an exemption that would allow him to take the state bar 
exam in february 
in 1983 when he was 14 baccus earned a bachelors degree in 
computer science and mathematics from the university of miami the 
following september he entered the universitys law school 
graduated in 1986 and was admitted to the florida bar 
during the year he established residency in new york and in 
january 1987 applied to take the state bar exam but because he 
wasnt 21 and had entered law school before age 18 his application 
was rejected the court papers said he appeared otherwise qualified

michael dukakis took his promise of 
economic opportunity to rural illinois missouri and arkansas on 
friday and said george bush and republicans were ignoring ominous 
trade and budget deficits because they dont know how to deal 
with it 
dukakis the democratic presidential nominee also took another 
indirect shot at bush and his running mate indiana sen dan 
quayle who is embroiled in a controversy over using family 
influence to get into the national guard at the height of the 
vietman war 
the test of strong presidential leadership is strength the 
quality of the people you select to serve with you dukakis told 
an early afternoon rally at the train depot in bismarck the crowd 
appeared to outnumber the towns population of 1600 people 
in belleville ill at the start of his day dukakis recalled 
harry trumans love of whistlestop campaigning and then boarded a 
train of his own the duke express to travel the day after 
bush accepted the republican presidential nomination 
today we are going to begin a journey into the future 
dukakis said while the vice president and the republicans took a 
trip down memory lane last night were looking to the future 
the democratic nominee said bushs convention address wasnt a 
bad speech actually but he attacked the vice president for 
failing to say how he would deal with the red ink on the budget and 
trade ledgers 
he talked a lot about missions but i must have missed a 
page said dukakis who did not watch bushs speech but reviewed 
its text there was nothing in there about the two biggest 
economic challenges we face in this country he said 
we didnt hear a word from the republicans on the budget 
deficit or the trade deficit last night or this week and we know 
why they dont know how to deal with it they dont know what to 
do with it thats why were going to have a democratic president 
and vice president 
the massachusetts governor at his rallies here and in 
belleville mentioned his states unemployment rate has been about 
3 percent for several years while the jobless rates in the illinois 
and missouri towns hover near 10 percent dukakis blamed reagan 
administration policies he said fueled prosperity in some regions 
but ingored and exacerbated economic distress in others 
they may be satisfied but we arent dukakis said we can 
do a lot better this january we americans are going to take 
charge of our economic future 
at both rallies he mentioned the deficits a lack of affordable 
housing the pentagon procurement scandal and the stewardship of 
former attorney general edwin meese iii saying republicans ducked 
those issues at their convention 
dukakis led the crowds in the refrain not a single word from 
the republicans after mentioning each of those issues 
dukakis boarded his 11car amtrak train in belleville and headed 
across the missouri river through st louis and down the 
mississippi river to bismarck a mining town where he visited a 
depotarea diner and was joined by a former rival missouri rep 
richard gephardt then it was all aboard for poplar bluff in 
southeastern missouri and walnut ridge in the farmlands of 
northeast arkansas the total distance of the trip was 239 miles 
from there dukakis was flying to texas to campaign saturday with 
his running mate sen lloyd bentsen 
the controversy over bushs selection of the 41yearold quayle 
as the gop vice presidential nominee and quayles use of family 
influece to get into the guard has prompted a revision of dukakis 
stump speech 
he has not criticized quayle directly but for the past three 
days has delivered a variation of this line at virtually every 
campaign stop nobody has ever questioned the qualifications of 
lloyd bentsento be vice president or the president 
dukakis drew laughs from reporters in bismarck when he joked 
about criticism from republicans that dukakis and his wife kitty 
show too much public affection 
its true that democrats sleep in double beds and republicans 
prefer twins he said thats why there are more democrats

leaders of local committee 
said friday they will defy israeli attempts to stamp out the 
informal system of selfrule that has sprung up during the 
8monthold palestinian uprising 
defense minister yitzhak rabin declared the popular 
committees illegal on thursday and threatened to deport prominent 
activists 
on friday prime minister yitzhak shamir said these 
committees incited disturbances and brought a lot of suffering upon 
the arab population we had to stop their activities 
palestinian intellectuals said the grassroots organization is 
far too extensive to be broken 
its a way of life now said saeb erakat a professor at an 
najah university in nablus which has been closed i dont think 
rabin with all the military might at his disposal can do anything 
about it except cause more suffering 
hundreds of committees have been formed in villages and towns of 
the occupied west bank and gaza strip and on almost every city 
block 
organizing began last spring in response to leaflets issued by 
the clandestine united national leadership of the uprising which 
is linked to yasser arafats palestine liberation organization 
in the mainly christian town of beit sahur organizers said 
groups of 40 to 70 families sent one representative each to 
neighborhood centers about 12000 palestinians live in the town 
near shepherds field where the bible says the first word of 
christs birth was announced 
neighborhood representatives elected committees of seven or 
eight members but israeli authorities arrested eight prominent 
palestinians who tried to form an independent town council 
the local committees provide an alternative authority to 
occupation and their ultimate aim is to cut ties between the 
people and israels military government said a 50yearold 
teacher who has been jailed several times for political activism 
he demanded anonymity to avoid arrest 
support for local committees appears strong in beit sahur it is 
fed by anger at israeli soldiers who are blamed for the death of a 
17yearold boy killed by a falling rock and the arrests of 120 
residents 
townspeople turned in their identity cards in protest after 
soldiers broke into living rooms to confiscate television sets and 
took cars from driveways in raids against delinquent taxpayers 
strikes and refusing to pay taxes are two of the main 
nonviolent ways to join the rebellion in which at least 248 
palestinians have been killed since dec 8 four israelis also have 
been slain 
soldiers shot and wounded at least two palestinians in the west 
bank on friday 
a commercial strike was only partially successful friday in the 
west bank and was ignored in the gaza strip the army delayed the 
opening of west bank schools and universities which it considers 
rallying points for violence until at least oct 1 
committees in beit sahur following a pattern in the occupied 
lands has mobilized palestinians for such nonviolent activities 
as 
planting gardens to reduce dependence on israeli markets and 
to raise money for other activities 
organizing underground schools after israel closed five 
universities and 1500 elementary and secondary schools 
giving money and food to families who have quit jobs in israel 
or whose breadwinners are in jail 
guarding neighborhoods from thieves after activists forced 
palestinian policemen to quit their jobs 
providing medical care for injured protesters 
a 45yearold professional who heads a committee said the army 
arrested volunteers who obeyed leaflets ordering a cleanup in the 
absence of city garbage collection which was suspended for lack of 
tax revenues 
its ridiculous he said is it political for me to want 
to plant vegetables teach my son or clean the street 
a defense ministry announcement said every person who 
continues to be a member of popular committees and every person who 
assists these committees will face arrest and trial 
moshe negbi of israels civil rights association said that meant 
anyone carrying a leaflet attending a meeting performing a 
service or contributing money to a committee could be jailed for 10 
years 
answers to rabin appeared in graffiti near beit sahurs 
nowinactive city hall increased violence will only increase our 
resistance and form more popular committees 
the committee leader said local groups would have to be a bit 
more cautious even go underground but we are not going to 
stop cooperating with each other people dont fear the 
soldiers any more we got rid of our fear 
other grassroots groups called strike forces paint slogans 
on walls and distribute leaflets telling residents when to strike 
and when to open stores 
masked teenagers threaten or punish people who pay israeli 
taxes or go to work during a strike 
a beit sahur doctors car was burned because he paid an israeli 
license fee so he could use it to visit patients a community 
leader said he disagreed with the arson but his committee was not 
consulted

sen dan quayle said today he broke no 
rules to get into the indiana national guard during the vietnam war 
and would do the same thing again 
at an outdoor news conference at his hometown quayle 
acknowledged that a family friend who was an employee of his 
grandfathers newspaper and a former commander of the indiana 
national guard probably interceded on his behalf 
the indianapolis news had reported thursday that its former 
managing editor wendell c phillippi had been asked about 
entering the guard by quayle 
wendell phillippi knew that i wanted to get into the national 
guard and i hope that he helped me and i think he did quayle 
told reporters today i would hope that he helped me and i expect 
that 
quayle said he initially called his parents to discuss his 
desire to enter the national guard when he was about to lose his 
colleage student deferment 
asked why he did not just go down and fill out papers if his 
entry into the guard was as routine as he suggested it was quayle 
said 
i do what any normal person would do at that age you call 
home you call home to mother and father and say id like to get 
in the national guard 
he said he also talked briefly to phillippi i told him i 
wanted to get into the national guard i would assume calls would 
be made i talked to mr phillippi very briefly i hope that he 
helped me and i thihnk he did 
quayle said he saw nothing wrong with what he did 
i got into the national guard fairly he said i did not 
ask anyone to break the rules and so far as i know no one did 
asked to assess the way he proceeded as a 22yearold he said 
i would not have done anything differently if he had known he 
would be running for vice president one day 
earlier today in new orleans quayle had poked fun at the 
controversy over his entry into the national guard during the 
vietnam war by introducing himself to party leaders in mock 
military fashion as if addressing a superior 
quayle who appeared with george bush at a republican national 
committee meeting the morning after the gop national convention 
unamimously ratified him as the vice presidential nominee said 
jokingly that he had learned how to introduce himself on the 
campaign trail 
then quayle snapped to attention and in loud staccatolike 
military diction said i stand at attention name dan quayle 
serial number 303 50 4096 indiana national guard six years and 
proud of it the audience applauded 
quayle proceeded to praise bush the presidential nominee 
before the two men headed out on the campaign trail traveling 
first to indiana quayles home state 
the indiana senator promised answers today to questions over 
what influence his family used to secure his entry into the 
national guard the issue tarnished quayle selection as the no 2 
on the gop ticket even before he was nominated thursday night 
aides to bush spent much of the day debating a response to the 
furor and denying any thought of replacing quayle on the ticket 
theres nothing we feel sen quayle misled us on bush 
campaign official rich bond said today on nbctv 
but critics were harsher 
lets face it the question is whether a rich kids family got 
him into the guard when other people were getting drafted said 
john decamp a vietnam veteran and republican delegate from 
nebraska some of them like me got shot at a lot and a great many 
of them just plain got shot and killed 
rep bob dornan of california every bit a conservative said 
it requires a checkerslike speech and he must do must do it 
quickly before this gets out of hand 
dornan referred to a televised speech during the 1952 campaign 
in which thengop vice presidential nominee richard m nixon 
successfully responded to allegations he had a slush fund while 
serving in the senate from california the speech in which he said 
his family and dog checkers were more important anything else 
kept nixon on dwight eisenhowers ticket 
i dont like the fact that quayle denied yesterday that 
anybody had interceded on his behalf when apparently someone had 
said rep helen bentley chairman of the bush campaign in maryland 
quayle can do one of two things admit this and that he was a 
liar or he can withdraw from the race 
but later thursday she backed off her strong criticism saying 
the issue was dead and had been based on inaccurate news 
reports 
quayle drew many defenders as well and at the end of the day 
it was certain he had the most important supporter of all 
im proud to have dan quayle at my side bush told the 
delegates 
for his part quayle said the focus should be on bush in the 
convention hall and refused on thursday to answer questions about 
how he got into the indiana national guard 
im going to continue to answer questions you raise about me 
about issues about anything through this campaign he said 
entering the superdome tonight is george bushs night and in 
deference to george bush im not going to get into all the details 
ill be around to answer your questions he added 
during his acceptance speech inside the hall the secondterm 
senator added a reference to show an unbending stand 
as a young man i served six years in the national guard and 
like the millions of americans who have served in the guard i 
am proud of it quayle said 
questions were first raised about his military service on 
wednesday when he and bush faced reporters for the first time 
together quayle called suggestions that his choice of the national 
guard was a method to avoid the draft and service in vietnam 
a cheap shot 
later wednesday he said he was not aware of any efforts by his 
family or friends to win him a spot in the guard 
he joined the national guard in 1969 days after he was 
graduated from college and thus lost his student deferment from the 
draft quayle was a private first class in the guard serving as a 
writer in a public information unit until 1975 
during the height of the draft and the vietnam war waiting 
lists were long to get into the guard in many states which 
exempted young men from the draft and carried only a small chance 
of being sent to the combat zone of southeast asia 
of the more than 58000 american casualties in the vietnam war 
97 were guardsmen in mobilized units about entering the guard by 
quayle 
phillippi who worked for quayles grandfather at the 
indianapolis newspaper said quayle inquired as to whether he might 
be sent to vietnam as part of a guard unit he wondered if it was 
subject to call phillippi said 
i just called the military department and said heres a good 
man you ought to take him phillippi said it was just as i 
have done for many young men over many years i was just a peon 
calling the military department i had no power 
some guard units were activated and sent to vietnam including 
at least one from indiana

a week after suggesting to a newspaper 
columnist that a 12yearold boy who was sexually molested might 
have enjoyed it a judge has removed himself from major criminal 
cases 
extensive controversy can impair the judicial process in 
criminal cases superior judge seymour hendel said as he 
announced his decision thursday in a statement to the day of new 
london whose columnist steven slosberg disclosed the judges 
remarks about two child molestation cases 
william r evans 39 had confessed to using money to lure the 
12yearold boy into sex acts in the other case edwin diaz 22 
admitted raping two girls ages 7 and 9 
in each case a prosecutor reduced multiple sexual assault 
charges to a single count of risk of injury to a minor hendel 
ordered both men to undergo sex offender treatment as a condition 
of probation 
in slosbergs aug 11 column hendel was quoted as saying the 
case involving the 12yearold boy was not a grave case while 
the sexual assault of the girls was a very bad case 
speaking about the evans case hendel was quoted as saying 
there was no force used if it wasnt for the disparity in 
age we might not have heard about it for all i know the kid 
might have enjoyed it 
hendel also was quoted in the column as saying the diaz case 
was seconddegree sexual assault there was no force 
the remarks drew criticism from the national organization for 
women and the new london womens center 
hendel said in the letter to the newspaper thursday that he has 
been open with the media in his 10 years on the bench 
the recent controversy is a direct result of my openness he 
wrote the content of the column does not represent my position 
and views in sexual abuse cases and in no way reflects my concerns 
and attitudes in these very serious and complex cases 
i deeply regret that as a result of this telephone 
conversation and the ensuing column families and victims who have 
been involved in sexual abuse cases may have been caused additional 
anguish 
slosberg said the judge never denied the accuracy of the quotes 
but said they were taken out of context 
judge aaron ment connecticuts chief court administrator said 
hendels decision wouldnt affect the flow of cases 
hendels comments were not a matter of review for his office 
but would be handled by the judicial review council ment said the 
chairman and the executive director of the council were on vacation 
friday according to secretaries at their offices another council 
member michael j daly of fairfield said he had not heard of the 
matter

police officials say a need to shed more light on 
their operations prompted them to make public the departments 
deadly force policy for the first time 
the policy is an amended simplified version of a plan that has 
been in effect since 1984 according to police spokesman ed 
spencer the revised version takes effect monday 
the policy states deadly force can be used only as a last 
resort and only when other reasonable alternatives are 
impractical or fail it prohibits the use of deadly force to 
protect property and forbids officers from firing warning shots 
dallas police have drawn criticism from minority group leaders 
in the past year for being too quick to shoot at suspects last 
summer a congressional subcommittee conducted a hearing into the 
departments deadly force policy prompted by two white officers 
slayings of two elderly blacks in unrelated cases the department

the head of a politburo commission studying the 
bloody history of josef stalins purges pledged in an interview 
published friday to root out those who blindly carried out the 
dictators wishes 
mikhail s solomentsev told the communist party newspaper pravda 
that since it began its work last october the commission had 
cleared the names of 636 people who were shot or imprisoned by 
stalin 
he also revealed that an investigation was under way into the 
murder in december 1934 of sergei kirov the popular leningrad 
party leader who opposed stalins absolute power some western 
historians believe stalin was responsible for the murder but 
accused his political opponents in order to destroy them 
many people are guilty of abuses some of them were named 
some not solomentsev said the measure of the guilt of every 
one of them will be determined 
the personal guilt of stalin and the people closest to him 
before the party and people for the mass repressions and 
lawlessness is dreadful he said but the guilt of the leaders 
does not relieve of responsibility the voluntary executors those 
directly involved in the infringement of socialist law those who 
supported and blindly fulfilled inhumane instructions committed 
outrages 
stalin ruled the soviet union from 192453 and some estimates 
say he was responsible for as many as 20 million deaths although 
the senior officials who helped him are nearly all dead other 
officials who started their careers in stalins last years are in 
positions of responsibility throughout the country 
the issue of clearing the names of those who were repressed by 
stalin and politically rehabilitating them is one of deep 
significance for soviets 
for many of them it means clearing a close relative 
clearing stalins victims also gives soviets an indication of 
what direction the leadership of mikhail s gorbachev wants to take 
the country 
soviets watch their leaderships evaluation of history closely 
because it very often is an indication of the partys goals 
gorbachev has said he wants to clear those purged by stalin to show 
soviets they have nothing to fear from speaking their minds 
solomentsev 74 is head of the party control commission which 
reviews charges of misconduct within party ranks 
at a communist party conference in moscow at the end of june 
former moscow party chief boris n yeltsin accused him of 
tolerating corruption among party workers and another speaker 
suggested he should retire 
after stalins death soviet leader nikita s khrushchev 
launched the first review of the repression but solomentsev said 
the work was not completed and did not cover abuses committed 
before 1934 
he said the commission is reviewing soviet archives and appealed 
to the public for information to help complete a thorough review of 
the terror it already has received 3000 letters and applications 
from members of the public he said 
we are equally interested in the fate of prominent leaders of 
the party and the soviet state and the rankandfile citizens 
workers peasants office workers party government and economic 
functionaries intellectuals he said 
solomentsev said the commission had already cleared 636 people 
and that many other cases were still under review 
among those whose names have been cleared this year of the 
criminal charges made against them by stalins prosecutors are 
prominent bolsheviks nikolai bukharin grigory zinoviev and lev 
kamenev each was a rival for the power that stalin took for 
himself 
they and many other prominent figures were shot or died in 
prison camps during stalins purges of the 1930s 
sixtyeight people have been readmitted to party rolls 
including bukharin whose economic polices serve as a model for 
some of gorbachevs reforms 
restoration of party membership is the final act of 
rehabilitating those repressed by stalin because it establishes not 
only that they were not guilty of criminal actions but that their 
political views were acceptable within the party 
among stalins victims were hundreds of thousands of balts 
crimean tatars and ethnic germans accused during world war ii of 
collaborating with nazi occupiers 
stalin also ordered the brutal drive for collectivization of 
agriculture in the 1930s when peasants who refused to leave their 
land for state farms were shot as examples to others and hundreds 
of thousands starved to death 
the commission is reviewing requests of relatives to compensate 
them for the suffering of their families by giving them better 
apartments benefits and returning confiscated property he said

stand and deliver celebrated on film 
the success of a real innercity high school calculus teacher and 
his students but in an ironic twist the film apparently led to a 
drop in the latest test scores 
the dip in the james a garfield high school scores wasnt 
dramatic but bore out instructor jaime escalantes concerns 
according to his principal 
he said the kids saw the movie so many times they thought 
passing the test was going to be as easy as the movie made it out 
to be principal maria elena tostado said thursday he said 
they didnt know it was so much hard work 
the warner bros film starring edward james olmos as escalante 
told the story of the instructors phenomenal success in teaching 
calculus to average students at garfield in 1982 and their triumph 
over accusations that they cheated on the advanced placement exam 
according to college board results 55 of the 119 garfield 
students who took the rigorous mathematics exam in may got a 
passing score of 3 or higher on a scale of 1 to 5 
that represents a passing rate of 46 percent down from 65 
percent last year 
this years percentage was the lowest in the nine years the test 
has been offered at garfield however more students took the test 
this year than in any previous year except 1987 
we went a little down but thats ok considering all the 
confusion and activity we had all year long ms tostado said 
in interviews after the movie opened escalante said constant 
interruptions by visitors including vice president george bush 
were distracting and that the kids are paying for it 
the school which serves a poor community where few parents have 
college educations ranked sixth in the nation among all schools 
that had passing scores on the beginning calculus exam and 59th 
among schools that had passing marks on the advanced calculus test

a singleengine plane carrying 400 live lobsters 
made an emergency landing friday in a park outside a prison 
pilot carsten petersen said his cessna 206 developed engine 
trouble west of london while flying from the outer hebrides islands 
off scotland to le touquet in northern france 
he was cleared to make an emergency landing at heathrow airport 
but the engine problem forced him to land on the first open terrain 
he could find a recreation ground behind wormwood scrubs prison in 
west london 
the 46yearold pilot and his cargo of crustaceans were 
unscathed but the plane cannot be removed without taking off its 
wings and petersen said the lobsters were unlikely to continue 
their journey to french gourmet restaurants 
the lobsters are sick of flying he said 
their reprieve was only temporary however the dealer who 
arranged the flight is diverting the shellfish to london 
restaurants and a colleague was dispatched to pick them up 
if you go into a good london restaurant you might get one

the town of hungerford grieved 
quietly friday the first anniversary of the worst mass murder in 
modern british history in which a man killed 16 people and wounded 
13 others before committing suicide 
the streets of the market town 60 miles west of london were 
nearly deserted and most of its shops were closed a small vase of 
flowers sat on the town hall steps and its flag flew at halfstaff 
people just want to try to put the past behind them and look 
towards the future said the rev david salt the local church of 
england vicar 
most of the bereaved are away from the town today they just 
want to be with themselves at this time 
a former mayor ron tarry said today is hopefully the final 
chapter in this tragedy the people of hungerford now hope they can 
get on with their lives without being in the press and on tv 
michael ryan a 27yearold unemployed loner and gun enthusiast 
stalked the streets and parks of his hometown and surrounding 
countryside for seven hours aug 19 1987 shooting neighbors and 
strangers with an arsenal of weapons 
he killed 16 of them including his mother wounded another 13 
shot his dog to death and burned down his mothers home and two 
others before holing up in an empty school when police surrounded 
the building and tried to talk him into surrendering he killed 
himself

defense secretary frank c carlucci said 
friday he is glad the pentagon came forward with a detailed account 
of the july 3 iran airline disaster on the day it occurred even 
though several key details were wrong 
a final investigative report released friday found that 
inexperience and the stress of battle the fog of war led 
the crew of the vincennes to reach several erroneous conclusions 
which carlucci and adm william crowe chairman of the joint chiefs 
of staff in turn had reported as fact 
the conclusions included 
the airliner was transmitting a signal identifying it as a 
warplane 
the plane was outside a commercial air corridor 
it was descending and accelerating as it approached the 
vincennes a flight pattern similar to that of an attacking fighter 
those mistakes have been at the heart of the controversy over 
why the uss vincennes mistook an iran air a300 airbus for an f14 
fighter and shot it down killing all 290 people aboard 
carlucci told a pentagon news conference friday that on the 
day that the incident occurred admiral crowe appeared before you 
and made available virtually every scrap of information that he had 
in our possession this was a deliberate decision 
and admiral crowe stated repeatedly that our initial 
information was preliminary and very likely to prove false in some 
instances nonetheless we decided to go ahead with it running the 
risk that there would be stories that the pentagon had put out 
mistaken information carlucci said 
on july 3 crowe told reporters that iran air flight 655 was 
outside a commercial air corridor and was descending and 
accelerating 
the final report found that ir 655 was not an the exact center 
of airway a59 but was 337 nautical miles west of the centerline 
however it was in the assigned airway 
and it said that at no time did ir 655 actually descend in 
altitude prior to engagement 
crowe also said on july 3 that the airplane was was emitting 
electronic signals that led the vincennes to conclude that the 
plane was an f14 
several days later pentagon spokesman dan howard told reporters 
the airbus had been broadcasting its position on a device known as 
an identification friend or foe iff transponder in mode 3 used 
by both civilian and military aircraft and in mode 2 used only by 
military aircraft 
the final report said the mode 2 reading was a mistake and that 
human error apparently led operators aboard the vincennes to 
receive an iff signal from a military aircraft at the bandar abbas 
airfield from which flight 655 took off and mistakenly conclude 
that the airbus was military 
that initial error led to the identification of the airliner as 
hostile just over three minutes into its flight and was not 
corrected during the remaining three minutes and 40 seconds before 
it was blasted from the sky by two sm2 standard missiles from the 
vincennes 
because the operator apparently failed to adjust the iff 
receiver aboard the vincennes to account for the approach of the 
aircraft the report said the mode 2 transmission from an 
aircraft on the ground would then be displayed and could have 
been generated by a military aircraft c130 f4 f14 located on 
the ground at bandar abbas 
the crew of the vincennes may have made the mistakes the report 
said because they were fighting iranian gunboats were heeling 
over at a 32degree angle while maneuvering to fight off the boats 
and had in their minds the attack by iraq on may 17 1987 against 
the uss stark in which 37 american sailors died 
the fog of war and those human elements which affect each 
individual differently not the least of which was the thought of 
the stark incident are factors that must be considered the 
report said

a landlord who allegedly denied an apartment to a 
couple because they had children has agreed to pay them 12000 
compensation the boston fair housing commission said 
a settlement of this type sends out the message that children 
have fair housing rights and that in the city of boston were 
enforcing those rights said the commissions executive director 
ernest b gutierrez jr 
gayle and donald guilford both 34 had sought to rent a 
threebedroom apartment in boston for themselves and their four 
daughters ages 1 2 12 and 14 
a real estate agent told the guilfords the apartment was 
available but gutierrez said landlord gary gwozdzik rejected the 
guilfords allegedly violating a 1982 city ordinance prohibiting 
discrimination against families with children 
the guilfords attorney nadine cohen said gwozdzik told the 
couple that he would not rent to them because of their children 
but the landlords attorney stephen a greenbaum said his 
client vehemently denies ever discriminating against the 
guilfords 
greenbaum said his client who is an average working guy who 
owns a total of five apartment units in the whole world has to pay 
his own legal fees and he simply could not afford the cost of 
litigating this case out through the fairing housing commission and 
the courts 
greenbaum said gwozdzik rejected the guilfords as tenants 
because he thought six people were too many for the apartment 
under state sanitary codes three bedrooms are adequate for a 
family of six 
the settlement was reached monday

a gas leak in a steering engine 
compartment was sealed by technicians friday another step toward 
clearing the space shuttle discovery for launch in late september 
or early october 
working in cramped quarters in discoverys upended cargo bay 
the workers bolted a clamshelllike device on a onehalfinch 
diameter fuel line that was detected leaking nitrogen tetroxide gas 
more than a month ago 
once the 2inch clamp was in place the technicians filled it 
with a sealing compound then they subjected the line to pressure 
tests and nasa spokesman karl kristofferson reported initial data 
indicated the leak had been plugged he said the seal would be 
monitored for several days to be sure there was no additional 
leakage 
if the seal holds as expected and if initially encouraging 
results of a solid fuel booster rocket test in utah hold up the 
space agency may set a date next week for launching discovery on 
the first shuttle mission since challenger exploded and killed its 
crew of seven on jan 28 1986 
officials have been considering a launch in late september or 
early october with sept 29 listed as one internal planning date 
an intentionally flawed booster was fired for two minutes 
thursday at the morton thiokol plant in utah in the fifth and final 
preflight test of the redesigned rocket a faulty joint in a 
booster was blamed for the challenger accident 
were ready to fly it looks like an absolutely great test 
from top to bottom said royce mitchell nasas solid rocket 
booster project manager 
however officials said that while initial results looked great 
it would take several days to thoroughly analyze the test data 
to reach the nitrogen tetroxide leak workers wednesday used an 
electric router to drill holes through the rear wall of discoverys 
60footlong cargo bay and through the adjoining hull of a steering 
engine compartment 
the tiny leak was 12 inches from the newly drilled access 
panels on a fitting in a vent line 
because discovery is standing vertically on the launch pad the 
rear wall of the cargo bay is parallel to the ground forcing the 
technicians to work on their hands and knees they worked in a 
cramped quarters surrounded by a tentlike canvas to prevent loose 
debris from reaching other areas of the shuttle 
when the leak was discovered more than a month ago officials at 
first feared they might have to move discovery off the launch pad 
to a hangar for repairs a move that could have delayed the launch 
for as much as two months into november 
but engineers came up with the innovative idea for making the 
fix on the pad 
the repair job was delayed until after the launch team conducted 
a successful test firing last week of discoverys three liquid fuel 
main engines the leak is in a separate engine system used to steer 
the shuttle in orbit

the family of jailed black 
activist nelson mandela on friday requested the government to 
release his medical records to determine whether prison conditions 
may have contributed to his contracting tuberculosis 
the 70yearold mandela leader of the outlawed african national 
congress was transferred a week ago from the pollsmoor prison in 
cape town to nearby tygerberg hospital 
reports of his illness triggered a wave of new appeals at home 
and abroad for his release after 26 years in jail 
a statement issued on behalf of the mandela family by 
antiapartheid activists said mandela was receiving good care at 
tygerberg but it questioned whether conditions at pollsmoor may 
have contributed to the disease or whether doctors there could have 
made a quicker diagnosis 
doctors have said the prognosis for mandelas recovery is good 
and treatment is expected to take about five months 
the statement asked that mandelas medical records be released 
to his family to dispel the nagging doubts existing in their 
minds it was signed by the rev beyers naude a white 
antiapartheid activist on behalf of a new group called the mandela 
crisis committee 
mandelas illness presents south african president pw botha 
with one of the toughest dilemmas of his 10 years in power 
the president who has faced rising pressure to free mandela 
knows that violence could break out if the leader dies in jail but 
he also knows that releasing the leader of the biggest guerrilla 
group fighting white rule would anger the right wing and could 
trigger renewed black activism as nationwide municipal elections 
approach on oct 26 
on thursday botha said mandelas release was under serious 
consideration and indicated the government was trying to mandela to 
accept its condition that he renounce violence 
mandela jailed since 1962 is serving a life sentence for 
plotting a sabotage campaign to overthrow the government and its 
apartheid system of racial segregation 
neither the anc nor mandelas family have issued a formal 
response to bothas remarks but the statement issued by the 
activists friday said mandela has made his position very clear 
regarding the issue of violence 
mandela rejected a previous offer of conditional release saying 
he would not renounce violence until the government legalized the 
anc dismantled apartheid and opened negotiations aimed at granting 
full political rights to the black majority 
the citizen a progovernment johannesburg daily quoted 
unidentified government sources as saying there was no possibility 
of mandelas release before the october elections which will mark 
the first time that blacks and whites across the country vote on 
the same day 
the government depicts the event as a major step toward 
democracy and has outlawed calls for an election boycott 
but antiapartheid groups have made clear they reject the 
election as an attempt to entrench a segregated political system 
south africas 26 million blacks have no vote in national 
affairs the 5 million whites control the economy and maintain 
separate districts schools and health services

an estimated 14000 cattle in north dakota are 
being tested for bovine tuberculosis and authorities are tracing 
cattle sold in iowa minnesota south dakota and texas that might 
have been exposed to the infectious disease the agriculture 
department said friday 
james glosser administrator of the departments animal and 
plant health inspection service said federal and state officials 
traced the suspected cattle to a herd in wyndmere nd 
this herd and two exposed herds were then placed under 
quarantine and tested for signs of tuberculosis he said so 
far 32 animals that reacted to the test have been sent to 
slaughter where a number of them showed evidence of tuberculosis 
on postmortem inspection 
glosser said the tuberculosis lesions were detected in early 
july during routine inspection at a west fargo nd slaughter 
plant 
he said the inspection service is taking steps to locate and 
test exposed herds as insurance against further spread of the 
disease 
all the exposed cattle are owned by members of the sheyenne 
grazing association of north dakota and are being tested by state 
and federal teams the cattle were said to feed on the same 
grassland as the herd of origin and could have come into contact 
with infected animals 
bovine tuberculosis can be spread among cattle through 
inhalation or by contaminated food and water sources he said 
humans can become infected by drinking unpasteurized milk from 
diseased cows 
because bovine tuberculosis can have a long incubation period 
a cow purchased today with a latent infection can eventually infect 
other animals even if it shows no signs of the disease glosser 
said clinical symptoms are not distinctive for many years after 
initial infection

smelly slimy slicks of algae along italys 
northern adriatic coast are scaring away tourists killing fish and 
sparking cries for an end to the dumping of untreated wastes into 
the sea 
mayors of seaside resorts in the romagna region with its 
jammed beach establishments one next to the other say tourists 
have fled and reservations for the rest of the season are down the 
algae problem is only getting worse 
its like swimming in mash said alberta de lorenzi a 
milanese who took vacation near the resort of rimini my children 
swim in the hotel pool the algae make tough going on 
paddleboats 
authorities say the decaying algae wont make bathers ill 
algae thrive on raw sewage and certain chemical pollutants 
including phosphates from detergents both are being dumped into 
the sea off the northeastern coast of italy the po river is 
estimated to carry more than 4000 tons of phosphates into the 
adriatic every year 
the multiplying algae consume the seas oxygen which in turn 
kills the fish the foul odor from the decaying fish makes the 
beach even less inviting 
this problem was especially bad off the coast at chioggia and 
ravenna a big tourist draw with its magnificent wellpreserved 
mosaics other stricken areas include venice and pesaro a music 
festival town in the marche region and a favorite vacation haunt 
for west germans 
some action is being taken 
environment minister giorgio ruffolo said a bill would be 
presented in parliament that would set the volume of phosphates in

president corazon aquino said friday 
she will abide by a legal ruling that would allow former president 
ferdinand marcos to come home in november to face an accuser in 
court 
marcos said friday he will ask to do so 
presidential spokesman marcial carreon quoted mrs aquino as 
saying she would respect the decision of the court even if it 
meant allowing marcos to return 
marcos has lived in hawaii since his ouster in a 1986 
civilianmilitary uprising mrs aquino has refused to let him 
return citing security concerns her government put down a coup 
attempt in january 1987 which she said was aimed at restoring 
marcos to power 
an antigraft court ruled thursday that the ousted president had 
a right to be present when his former public works secretary 
testifies against him about questionable contracts awarded during 
his 20year presidency 
the nov 7 hearing is not a trial but a perpetuation 
proceeding to take testimony from former government minister 
baltazar aquino who court officials say is gravely ill 
baltazar aquino who is not related to the president is to 
testify about allegedly illegal contracts granted to japanese firms 
during marcos reign 
under philippine law his testimony can be used against marcos 
at a trial even if the witness is dead but justice augusto amores 
said the testimony could be used in court only if marcos had the 
opportunity to crossexamine the witness 
the court said marcos had the constitutional right to appear at 
the proceedings which cannot be denied to him in the absence of 
more cogent reasons amores said marcos could appear personally 
or be represented by counsel 
i directed my lawyer to seek the court order for me to come 
home and defend myself in the proceedings marcos told filipino 
reporters by telephone from his exile home in hawaii i want to 
represent myself said marcos who is a lawyer 
marcos said his former minister had been pressured into agreeing 
to testify because of his poor health 
solicitorgeneral francisco chavez said he opposed allowing 
marcos to come home and believed his presence was unnecessary if he 
were represented by counsel 
there are questions of national security chavez said 
its not a purely legal question 
marcos has never been charged with any criminal offense despite 
allegations of wrongdoing while in office marcos has warned that 
if criminal charges are filed he would dismiss his lawyer rafael 
recto and demand the right to represent himself 
philippine law allows defendants to be represented by counsel of 
their choice and bars criminal trials in absentia government 
sources say those regulations are largely responsible for the delay 
in filing criminal charges against marcos 
swiss authorities have expressed reluctance in lifting banking 
secrecy laws until criminal charges against marcos are filed the 
philippine government believes marcos stashed millions of dollars 
in secret swiss bank accounts although he denies the claim 
in its ruling the court authorized the philippine consul in 
honolulu to serve notice of the proceedings to marcos and to 
publish the announcement in newspapers there for three consecutive 
weeks 
in may mrs aquino turned down a request by marcos to return 
here for the burial of his mother josefa who died may 4 
the body of marcos mother is unburied marcos said her burial 
would be my first duty after his return

the louisiana superdomes metamorphosis from 
a place for presidential politics back to the worlds largest 
indoor football stadium was in full swing friday 
what took weeks to build for the republican national convention 
which ended thursday night will take a few days to tear down 
its almost sad said will peneguy a superdome spokesman 
we watched them put the podium up there was so much detail work 
craftsmanship it was sad even then knowing it was going to have to 
come down 
a backhoe chomped down on the 560000 podium from which george 
bush had accepted the gop presidential nomination the night before 
smashing it to smithereens in minutes 
greg lane operations manager for the freeman cos watched the 
backhoe operator demolish his firms hard work without so much as a 
sigh 
were in the convention business so no its not sad he 
said 
it will take 8000 manhours to rip up the 12 million pounds of 
scaffolding tear up the 150000 square feet of plywood and take 
out the 150000 nuts bolts and screws that made up the podium 
stairways and wooden floors 
the red carpets new orleans rolled out for the gop had been 
pulled up from the dome floor and the decorative trees were being 
hauled out on trolleys 
a few of thursday nights red white and blue balloons were 
still mixed in with the brokendown scaffolding and scrap lumber 
being carted off 
confetti dusted the floors and handmade bushquayle signs were 
crammed into garbage cans 
i think it looks a lot different from last night said bobby 
franks operations manager for south central bell telephone co 
what you have here is a transformation from the republican 
national convention look to the football stadium look and it will 
end up looking like the magnificent building that it is 
south central bell worked from midnight thursday to 8 am 
tearing down the thousands of feet of cable installed for the 
convention 
the convention required 9000 lines of cable compared with the 
last major dome event a super bowl with 1000 cable lines 
the dome must be restored to its former self by thursday lane 
said 
everythings going right on schedule peneguy said wed 
like it finished in time for the gatorade jamboree a prep football 
doubleheader on friday

the soviet unions intervention that crushed 
czechoslovakias prague spring 20 years ago saved the country 
from irresponsible leadership and possible brutual repression of 
communists tass said friday 
a commentary by the official soviet news agency was the first 
comment by the soviets on the anniversary of the aug 2021 1968 
crushing of a liberalization campaign in czechoslovakia by the 
soviet union 
antisocialist forces taking advantage of political 
irresponsibilty and opportunism of a part of the leadership of the 
communist party of czechoslovakia of that time made an attempt 
to tear czechoslovakia away from the socialist community tass 
said the friends and allies of socialist czechoslovakia could 
not remain indifferent it said 
czechoslovak society was threatened with a possibility that 
accounts would be settled with upright communists in a brutal 
way tass said 
the commentary by news analyst alexander kondrashov was 
consistent with past soviet statements on the prague spring 
but contrasted sharply with an article in the current issue of the 
weekly arguments and facts 
in the article historian ls yagodovsky compared the goals of 
the czechoslovak reforms with those efforts by mikhail s gorbachev 
in the soviet union yagodovsky also drew the conclusion that the 
intervention by soldiers from the soviet union and warsaw pact 
allies was necessary because czechoslovak leaders could not control 
the reform movement 
gorbachev is trying to loosen state control of the soviet 
economy while encouraging more open discussion of current policy 
and past mistakes 
the intervention stopped the liberalization campaign begun under 
czechoslovak leader alexander dubcek who was replaced the 
following year by gustav husak 
husak ran one of the more conservative soviet bloc organizations 
until he stepped down late last year 
tass said calls from the west for the soviet union to admit it 
made a mistake in czechoslovakia have the aim to question not 
only the policy of the ussr and of czechoslovakia but also the 
entire process of positive changes in the world 
american leaders such as president lyndon b johnson were 
interested in tearing czechoslovakia away from the soviet union 
rather than the actual changes taking place in the country it said

george bush and dan quayle went back home to quayles indiana on 
friday where the young vice presidential candidate defended his 
national guard service in a news conference amplified for an 
appreciative town folk 
the tougher the question the louder the boos 
the more forceful the answer the louder the cheers 
i got into the national guard fairly he said i did not 
ask anyone to break the rules and so far as i know no one did 
the indianapolis news had reported thursday that its former 
managing editor wendell c phillippi had been asked about 
entering the guard by quayle 
phillippi was a former commander of the state national guard 
wendell phillippi knew that i wanted to get into the national 
guard and i hope that he helped me and i think he did quayle 
told reporters i would hope that he helped me and i expect 
that 
but the 41yearold twoterm senator said he saw nothing wrong 
with that and would do the same thing again 
with the republican ticket riding a wave of optimism out of the 
justended gop convention in new orleans the democratic duo of 
michael dukakis and lloyd bentsen were going their separate ways 
before linking up saturday in texas 
bentsen said the gop convention looked to him like a mardi 
gras for the moral majority that ignored the concerns of working 
people 
dukakis meanwhile was playing a similar tune on a whistlestop 
trip through the scenic hills of missouri and arkansas 
before leaving new orleans quayle joked about the controversy 
when he and bush appeared at a postconvention meeting of the 
republican national committee in new orleans 
adopting a military posture his shoulders sqaured his back 
straight quayle shouted in a clipped voice i stand at 
attention name dan quayle serial number 303 50 4096 indiana 
national guard six years and proud of it 
the audience laughed and cheered 
the conservative senator from indiana has been dogged by 
questions about whether he used family influence to get into the 
national guard at the height of the vietnam war virtually assuring 
he would avoid combat 
dukakis on a whistlestop train tour through illinois missouri 
and arkansas lost no time jibing at bushs performance in new 
orleans 
last night we heard a lot of talk about missions dukakis 
said at a trackside rally in belleville ill 
he talked a lot about missions but i must have missed a 
page he said we didnt hear a word from the republicans about 
the budget deficit or the trade deficit last night or this week 
and we know why they dont know how to deal with them 
bentsen the democratic vice presidential nominee was in dallas 
where he said the republican convention was dominated by the hard 
right 
what we saw was the republicans putting on a convention for 
the far right bentsen said they had a mardi gras for the 
moral majority 
bentsen also was asked about a report in fridays washington 
post that his blind trust invested in his sons business after 
being steered there by the senator 
he said he reported the trusts investment in his sons company 
frankly i didnt have to report it bentsen said 
he said his wifes position as a trustee on a mutual fund 
affiliated with the manager of his trust in no way compromised the 
blind trust no not at all absolutely not he said 
he said his wife was one of the directors representing the 
stockholders and not the management its almost an adversarial 
relationship he said 
bush and quayle were ebullient when they showed up for the early 
morning meeting of the republican national committee 
now we start said bush now comes the beginning of the 
end and last night there was a shifting of the gears the 
nominee said that he had received a congratulatory telephone call 
from president reagan last night after accepting the gop 
presidential nomination 
we are going to win this election he predicted 
bush told the republicans you have given us a tremendous 
sendoff i cant think of a better way to get out of town 
republicans were generally upbeat and giving rave reviews to 
bushs big speech 
he hit it he hit it out of the park exulted sen alfonse 
damato of new york for me it was a question of survival the 
speech of his life and he did it massachusetts delegate joyce 
hampers called it a grand slam 
nebraska gov kay orr said it was a sensitive speech because 
he was so strong and yet so sensitive he showed that he is attuned 
to the american people i believe he revealed a george bush people 
have not yet seen and had a chance to appreciate 
the gop also got good news from the latest polls which said the 
race was a dead heat after months in which dukakis led by as much 
as 17 points in most surveys 
a cnnusa today poll of 1087 registered voters wednesday put 
the race at 45 percent for bush and quayle to 43 percent for 
dukakis and bentsen 
a second cnnusa today poll of 842 registered voters thursday 
night put the race at 45 for bushquayle to 44 for dukakisbentsen 
the spreads were within the polls margins of error three points 
in the first poll four in the second

burmas attorney general became its 
first civilian leader in 26 years friday and made a speech 
conciliatory to students whose protests ousted his predecessor the 
students rejected him and called for a general strike 
maung maung a useducated lawyer seen as a figurehead for the 
military was appointed chairman of the burma socialist program 
party in an emergency party session and legislators of the 
peoples assembly elected him president rangoon radio reported 
sein lwin a former general blamed for the bloody suppression of 
previous student protests stepped down as president aug 12 after 
five days of antigovernment demonstrations in which at least 95 
people were killed 
he held office for only 17 days after the resignation of ne win 
who had ruled since a coup in 1962 and brought economic ruin a rich 
nation 
maung maung told the party session in a speech broadcast later 
that party leaders must fulfill the just and explicit desires of 
the people and improve their living conditions 
simply lecturing others is not sufficient he said we 
should also improve ourselves that we should know more 
observe more and do more is obvious from the demonstrations staged 
by the innocent people 
he cautioned against anger and vengeance in seeking out those 
responsible for riots and declared we should find ways and do 
everything we can to avoid similar disastrous and dangerous events 
from emerging again in the future 
maung maung said it has been almost a year since ne win spoke of 
the need for economic reform he said some young people had been 
deprived of opportunities to study and educational reform was under 
way 
students led the mass protests that brought down sein lwin 
although the government said 95 were killed and 240 wounded when 
troops fired into crowds of protesters western diplomats said 
hundreds may have died 
students have called for a nationwide strike on monday one 
western diplomat in rangoon said by telephone theyre agitating 
for abolition of oneparty rule the more militant leaders are 
disappointed 
he said students passed out leaflets at a peaceful rally in 
front of rangoon general hospital a gathering place for 
demonstrators since security forces allegedly shot doctors and 
nurses there a week ago japans kyodo news service reporting from 
rangoon said 15000 people joined the rally 
kyodo also said about 100000 people marched in the northern 
city of mandalay the countrys secondlargest city in the second 
straight day of mass prodemocracy demonstrations kyodo said 
provincial government workers walked off their jobs to join the 
demonstration mandalays 1984 population was only 600000 
under ne win burma was transformed from a democracy and one of 
southeast asias wealthiest countries to one of its poorest 
rivaled only by communistruled laos and cambodia rampant 
inflation food shortages and other economic hardships have fed 
popular resentment and support for the student demands 
the choice of maung maung surprised analysts who predicted the 
new leader would come from among active and retired top military 
officers who helped ne win take the burmese way to socialism 
a mixture of rigid socialist economics military control and 
isolation 
maung maung 63 and education minister kyaw sein are the only 
civilians in the top ranks of the militarydominated government 
hierarchy 
he has a law degree from yale university where he spent two 
years as a visiting lecturer in the early 1960s 
after the 1962 coup he served as chief justice and in 1972 was 
named justice minister he was elected to the party central 
committee in 1976 and ranked fifth in the party hierarchy he 
withdrew from the committee in 1985 for health reasons 
maung maung returned to the committee after ne win resigned july 
23 and he was named attorney general 
minoru kiryu a burma scholar in tokyo said the election of 
maung maung was the best possible choice for the party in its 
conciliatory move to soothe the people who are demanding quick 
changes and reforms 
an asian diplomat in rangoon said maung maunghe was generally 
welcomed by intellectuals while the general public including 
workers were showing a waitandsee attitude 
brang seng leader of the kachin guerrilla army and vice 
president of the national democratic front of 10 rebel groups told 
kyodo that the front will join the students and citizens fighting 
in the movement for democracy to establish a provisional government 
for national reconciliation 
as long as the oneparty dictatorship continues we will 
continue our struggle against whoever is chosen as the next 
leader he was quoted as saying 
just before sein lwin resigned brang seng called for an 
offensive by the rebel front which claims to have 35000 fighters 
in its 40yearold war for greater autonomy for ethnic minorities 
radio rangoon said 52 people arrested in the rioting in rangoon 
were freed thursday that brought the number of people reported 
freed in the capital to 155 but thousands more are believed to be 
behind bars 
still held are several people arrested july 2930 including the 
countrys leading dissident aung gyi and sein win the burma

iraqs proposed purchase of an idle texas 
steel plant from usx corp appears to raise no national security 
questions a commerce department official said friday 
the technology is very old very outmoded said the 
official adding that department officials dont anticipate any 
national security issues to be involved 
the official spoke on condition he not be identified 
a justice department spokesman mark sheehan said the 
department was taking a preliminary look at whether the proposed 
sale warranted an antitrust investigation 
rep jack fields rtexas who strongly opposes the deal said 
iraqs ambassador to the united states abdulamir alanbari had 
told him a 1 million downpayment already had been made to usx a 
pittsburghbased steel and energy concern 
fields represents a district near houston that includes the 
baytown steel plant he has asked president reagan the justice 
department the pentagon and the commerce department to investigate 
the proposed sale on grounds that it poses national security risks 
and that it would unlawfully limit domestic competition 
i am convinced usx is trying to keep the price of steel slab 
and steel plate high fields said 
william p ryder a usx spokesman confirmed that negotiations 
to sell the steel plant to iraq were under way but he would not 
comment on a new york times report that iraq was willing to pay 
100 million for the 20yearold equipment 
the times report said iraq had indicated it wanted the 
steelmaking equipment to help expand production in its oil fields 
which are linked to an extensive network of pipelines 
efforts to reach officials at the iraqi embassy in washington on 
friday were unsuccessful 
fields claimed two us companies were ready to pay a price 
comparable to the iraqi offer he identified them as major 
financial services corp of tallahassee fla and birmingham steel 
corp of birmingham ala 
fields said usx had made statements that have led me to 
believe they really do not want to sell to an american company 
they want to remove capacity it keeps their prices high 
ryder said the company would not respond to fields claims 
fields said he was concerned that usx would be exporting state 
of the art armorizing technology which is used for tanks and other 
military applications 
at the pentagon spokesman lt col keith schneider said on 
the surface it is not a defense issue 
the plant which once employed as many as 2000 people was shut 
down two years ago amid labor turmoil and declining demand for 
steel it had produced up to 13 million tons a year of 
largediameter pipe used for us oil and natural gas pipelines 
the works includes electric furnaces for melting scrap casters 
to shape molten steel into slabs and a mill for making slabs into 
oil drilling pipe 
fields said 750 people could be employed if the plant were 
reopened

farmers net cash income this year probably 
will be greater than predicted a month ago despite the drought and 
it may exceed last years record the agriculture department said 
friday 
although some crop farmers have suffered severe losses others 
with irrigation or normal rainfall have benefited from the higher 
prices the departments economic research service said 
higher feed costs and poor range and pasture conditions are 
hurting livestock incomes it said 
the higher prices and reduced harvests this year will cut deeply 
into us farm exports in 198889 the report showed 
no dollar estimates were included but the report said the 
higher prices and generally adequate supplies abroad will 
likely reduce the 198889 volume of wheat exports by 12 percent 
corn by 4 percent and soybeans by 29 percent 
farmers suffering severe losses will get some relief from the 
recently enacted 39 billion disaster assistance legislation the 
report said 
nationally net cash income the difference between gross cash 
income and cash expenses was forecast to be in a range of 55 
billion to 60 billion compared with the record of 571 billion 
in 1987 a month ago the agriculture departments 1988 forecast 
was 53 billion to 59 billion

the postal service doesnt keep statistics on the size of such 
thefts so there was no way to compare it to previous incidents 
said dean nichols a postal inspector in birmingham ala 
an estimated 500000 pieces of mail up to three years old were 
discovered said pensacola postmaster ben jasek most of it was 
thirdclass bulk mail but between 500 and 600 pieces of 
firstclass mail primarily for customers who had moved and which 
should have been forwarded also were discovered none of it 
appeared to have been opened jordan said 
officials declined to release the identity of the carrier who 
worked out of a post office in pensacola for three years but lived 
in nearby milton 
federal prosecutors will seek a indictment against the carrier 
for obstruction of the mail a felony with a fiveyear maximum 
prison term and possibly other charges jordan said at a news 
conference 
the carrier who has worked for the postal service for 15 years 
has been placed on administrative leave without pay pending 
completion of the investigation officials said 
this incident is a slap in the face to our customers the 
public said jasek who became postmaster here only three weeks 
ago we are angry dismayed and confused that one of our 
coworkers could do such a thing 
the suspect who is in his 50s apparently acted alone jasek 
said he said the employee is unmarried but declined to answer 
whether he lived alone no motive has been established 
jasek said he was surprised the carriers 500 rural customers 
didnt notice their mail missing the post office had never 
received any complaints he said 
this is a fluke all i can say is that rural carriers are kind 
of their own entity he said 
the raid began monday after a tip from a neighbor by thursday 
investigators said they had collected several truckloads of 
magazines catalogs sweepstakes offers circulars free mail 
samples and other items piled in the carriers house packed into a 
storage shed and littering the surrounding woods 
jordan said more mail some of it three years old and badly 
deteriorated was collected friday 
william read communications manager for the postal services 
new orleans division said the exact amount hadnt yet been 
determined but that 16 hampers each with about 260 pounds of mail 
hauled to a warehouse by thursday was about the midpoint the 
recovered mail was trucked to a pensacola warehouse 
investigators were sorting the mail and contacting each mailer 
to see if they still want it delivered some of it will be held as 
evidence and the rest will be destroyed 
we hate to destroy it but some is just undeliverable 
jordan said

by an 83 vote federal reserve policymakers 
decided in late june to push interest rates up further in an effort 
to fight inflation according to minutes of the discussions 
released friday 
the further credit tightening was approved with the three 
dissenters complaining that they believed the central bank was 
moving too quickly in its inflationfighting efforts 
the majority of fed officials however called for the central 
bank to increase slightly its restraint on the reserves held by 
commerical banks lowering the amount of cash banks have available 
to back loans drives up the interest rates charged on those loans 
since late march the central bank has engaged in a series of 
credit tightening moves in reaction to a surprisingly strong 
economy which has made job markets tighter and increased 
inflationary pressures this year 
last week the central bank boosted its discount rate by 
onehalf percentage point to 65 percent an increase in the 
discount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can send 
of its intention to drive interest rates higher as a way of 
dampening demand and thus fighting inflationary pressures 
the increase in the discount rate was approved on a unanimous 
vote however back in late june fed policymakers were divided on 
what their next step should be 
board governors wayne angell martha seger and edward kelley jr 
opposed the tightening move arguing that the fed should wait to 
see the impact of its earlier tightening efforts before going 
farther 
but the majority contended that further immediate tightening was 
needed arguing that there were substantial risks involved in 
not moving forcefully to combat inflation some fed members argued 
for an even bolder tightening step than the one taken arguing for 
an immediate increase in the discount rate an action the central 
bank eventually took on aug 9 
fed policymakers met again behind closed doors on tuesday to 
assess monetary policy the minutes of that meeting will not be 
released until sept 23 but many private economists believe the 
central bank decided to continue pushing interest rates higher in 
an effort to slow an economy where demand pressures are bumping up 
against tight labor markets and capacity restraints 
these analysts however are not looking for a further boost in 
the discount rate until after nov 8 because of electionyear 
pressures 
the fed tightening so far has pushed up a variety of interest 
rates including banks prime lending rate which is now at 10 
percent the first time it has been in doubledigits in three years 
mortgage rates have been rising as well the federal home loan 
mortgage corp reported friday that fixedrate mortgages now stand 
at 1071 percent up from 1057 percent last week analysts are 
predicting fixedrate mortgages will soon top 11 percent

the police department recalled 2000 smith amp 
wesson 38caliber revolvers the newest gun used by offduty 
officers to examine them for a possible firing defect officials 
said friday 
we found after repeated firings a problem could develop where 
the hammer would freeze rendering the gun inoperable said capt 
john c cerar the head of the departments firearms and tactics 
section 
the problem which may affect 15 percent of the 60ny1type 
handguns was discovered by department gunsmiths in late july and 
officers were ordered not to use the guns cerar said 
in any police department it is standard procedure to issue a 
notice of this type when any potential problem is encountered with 
a firearm in order to avert the possibility of risk to an 
officer said warren tomek director of quality assurance for the 
springfield mass weapons manufacturer 
smith amp wesson said the flaw was due to an assembly problem and 
estimated that less than 10 percent of the guns shipped to the 
citys police departments were affected 
although the handgun is used as both a service and offduty gun 
in police departments throughout the country the specific 
problem is limited to the special design of the model 60s being 
used in new york city tomek said 
the gun used by the citys three police forces is specially 
modified and is not sold on the market smith amp wesson said

million acres of farmland in his country adding to the dangers 
facing egypts floodravaged southern neighbor 
ambassador elamin abdellatif said his government now was 
fighting rain floods and locusts all at once 
torrential rains on aug 45 that caused flooding in northern 
eastern and central sudan killed 91 people and left more than 15 
million homeless more rains expected in ethiopia at the nile 
river source and the approaching annual nile flood could worsen 
the disaster 
the biggest worry to the government now are the locusts 
abdellatif said in prerecorded remarks broadcast friday on 
cairos staterun television he said a locust invasion put 5 
million acres of cultivated land in danger of destruction 
including 200000 acres of cotton one of sudans main crops 
we hope our brothers in the arab states and in the 
international community will help to overcome this he said 
sudans agriculture minister elfateh elteegany said

the consumer product safety commission charged 
friday that the giant retailer sears roebuck and co has continued 
to sell lawn darts violating its official promise to stop 
marketing the hazardous game 
the safety commission filed suit in federal district court in 
washington asking that sears be found in contempt and be ordered 
to halt lawn dart sales to survey all its stores to make sure 
sales have been stopped and to compensate the commission for its 
costs in policing the agreement 
im disappointed at sears for this new violation but expect 
this contempt action will send a strong message to sears and other 
retailers that the cpsc will enforce its regulations on lawn 
darts said commission chairman terrence m scanlon 
sears headquarters in chicago said in a statement we received 
the motion today from the cpsc and we are in the process of 
reviewing it 
sears and the safety commission announced a consent agreement in 
march in which the retailer said it was halting all lawn dart 
sales however commission investigators report they later found 
the darts being sold by sears in puerto rico 
the march agreement settled commission charges that sears had 
violated federal rules that ban sales of the long metal darts in 
or near toy sections of stores 
the darts thrown at targets on the ground in a sort of 
horseshoeslike game have been blamed on several injuries in 
recent years and at least one death under federal rules they can 
be sold only in sporting goods departments and stores 
in its statement friday sears said it learned only thursday 
that the darts were found on sale at one store in puerto rico last 
june although we had ordered this product removed from sale two 
months earlier we have made diligent efforts to assure that all of 
our more than 800 retail stores have removed lawn darts from sale

the head of the state board that has taken 
over yonkers purse strings ordered the city friday to write a plan 
for phasing out services in the event a judges fines bring on 
insolvency 
we need a detailed approach to how were going to counter that 
financial collapse what is your city officials judgment on 
who gets laid off first said secretary of state gail shaffer 
who also is chairman of the state emergency financial control board 
on wednesday the 2nd us circuit court of appeals temporarily 
extended a stay of heavy fines that a federal judge had imposed 
against the city and four councilmen for refusing to approve a 
housing desegregation plan 
the appeals panel did not say when it would rule on a city 
request to disallow the fines entirely the fines double daily and 
could bankrupt the city 
shaffer said at a news conference that as of friday afternoon 
local banks were told not to cash any city checks including 
payroll checks unless she had cosigned them 
city manager neil deluca called for a meeting of the full 
financial board he complained that he was wasting time answering 
gail shaffers shenanigans and charged that she was engaged in a 
campaign designed to hoodwink the media and the public 
i dont see it as a power struggle responded shaffer who 
notified the city of her decision through the news media 
the board shaffer heads was created in 1984 when the state 
bailed out younkers from imminent bankruptcy it agreed earlier 
this week to take over the citys finances in the wake of the 
dispute over the judges fines 
if residents are worried about the threat of financial collapse 
shaffer said they should communicate it to the councilmen who 
are defying the law bringing the city to its knees fiscally 
in 1985 us district judge leonard b sand ruled that yonkers 
the states fourthlargest city had intentionally segregated its 
housing and schools for four decades 
the city enacted a school desegregation plan but on aug 1 
four of seven city council members refused to endorse a plan to 
build moderateincome housing in largely white neighborhoods and 
sand found them and the city in contempt 
the city is asking the appeals court to throw out the fines 
saying that sand exceeded his authority and arguing that the city 
residents should not be made to suffer because of four intransigent 
council members 
deluca called ridiculous shaffers charge that the city was 
not prepared for the possibility of financial collapse 
ive told employees that staff layoffs might occur real 
soon deluca said adding that the city already has plans for 
cutting all nonessential services and laying off all nonessential 
employees three days before the city runs out of money police and 
firefighters would be kept until the last possible moment

thousands of people were killed in the 
central african country of burundi this week in battles between 
members of the rival hutu and tutsi tribes government and 
opposition officials said friday 
there were reports of systematic slaughter in two northern 
villages and a lake filled with thousands of corpses several 
thousand people were said to have fled the country to escape the 
bloodbath 
the government said the army had stopped the fighting between 
the majority hutu and the tutsi who control the military and 
government 
in april 1972 the hutu tried to overthrow the government but 
the coup failed and the tutsi retailiated by killing 100000 hutu 
official reports said most of the victims this week were tutsi 
but an exiled opposition group the hutu people liberation party 
accused the army of massacring hutus 
there are thousands of hutus corpses the victims of tutsi 
soldiers floating in lake tanganyika the opposition group said 
neither claim could be confirmed independently 
more than 7000 burudians were reported to have fled to 
neighboring rwanda sources in rwanda including diplomats said 
the refugees included members of both the tutsi and hutu tribes 
and both sides reported thousands of deaths 
fighting began sunday near the northern villages of marangara 
and ntega the government radio reported friday 
some inhabitants of northern burundi belonging to the minority 
tutsi tribe were killed in a selective manner it foreign 
minister cyprien mbonimpa as saying 
although the violence was confined to a section of the north 
the government imposed a nationwide overnight curfew and prohibited 
meetings of more than five people without government permission 
the emergency order was signed by maj pierre buyoya a tutsi 
who took power in a bloodless coup last september 
we suspect that some former hutu refugees infiltrated the 
country from some foreign countries they incited the hutu and 
called on them to massacre the tutsi population astere 
nzisabira burundis ambassador to belguim said in a radio 
interview thursday in brussels 
authorities intervened in a peaceful manner after the first 
day of violence but the following day the murders resumed in 
full swing he said at that stage the army had to intervene 
and restore peace to the country he had no specific death toll 
but said the numbers were much higher than the initial estimates of 
300400 dead 
also friday radio kigali the rwandan government radio said 
its government was trying to provide food and shelter for the 
influx of burundians 
burundi with nearly 5 million people in an area about the size 
of maryland is one of africas most densely populated countries 
about 85 percent of its people belong to the hutu tribe and the 
rest are tutsis 
ethnic struggles have plagued burundi since independence from 
belguim in 1962 for generations the tall lanky tutsi held the 
short stocky hutu in feudal serfdom 
in 1976 col jeanbaptiste bagaza mounted a bloodless coup that 
ousted michel micombero who had sanctioned the hutu slaughter four 
years earlier bagaza like micombero was a tutsi 
bagaza was overthrown sept 4 by buyoya who pledged to resolve 
ethnic differences

a senior plo leader said friday that egypt 
had agreed to help persuade the united states not to veto plans for 
a palestinian provisional government in the un security council 
egypt provided no confirmation of any such agreement 
the official hani elhassan also said in recorded remarks on 
egypts staterun television that it would take years for the 
palestinian plans to materialize 
hassan a political adviser to palestine liberation organization 
chairman yasser arafat declared when we the plo announce a 
state and a government it doesnt mean we will see a result in one 
or two weeks 
we are talking about a stage that will bear fruit in the early 
1990s in three or four years 
hassan was part of a threeman plo delegation that left egypt on 
thursday after four days of talks with president hosni mubarak and 
other officials 
he said on the weekly prerecorded program brotherly 
meetings that the plo expects the united states to use its veto 
power at the security council to block acceptance of a palestinian 
provisional government 
hassan said he discussed this with mubarak and that the 
president said he was ready to pressure the united states into 
accepting the proposal 
while egypt did not confirm this foreign minister esmat 
abdelmeguid said at the end of the meetings that egypt would put 
all its resources behind the plo 
plo delegation member mahmoud abbas said mubarak agreed the plo 
should establish a provisional government with an internationally 
acceptable political agenda 
washington refuses to negotiate with the plo unless it 
recognizes israel and renounces terrorism a us veto could end a 
plo effort to win un recognition of any government it might form 
hassan said he also believed that saudi arabia and iraq stood 
ready to pressure washington to forgo a veto 
the plo is debating proposals designed to fill the vacuum left 
by jordan which announced this month it was disengaging from the 
israelioccupied west bank and inviting the plo to assume control 
there 
jordan had maintained administrative and political links with 
the neighboring territory it controlled before israel seized the 
area in the 1967 middle east war 
plo proposals include declaring a state in the west bank and 
gaza strip a region bordering egypt which the israelis also 
occupy about 15 million palestinians live in the occupied 
territories where a palestinian uprising has been going on since 
december 
plo officials have also talked about setting up a 
governmentinexile or a provisional government headed by plo 
leaders they gave few details on how these proposals would differ 
hassan made clear in the tv interview that the choice most 
favored was a provisional government however he said all 
proposals would be submitted for approval to the palestine natonal 
council the plos legislative arm that functions as a 
parliamentinexile the body is to meet in algeria next month 
the plo leader also repeated earlier plo statements that a 
provisional government would recognize israel in exchange for 
israels recognition of a palestinian state in the occupied 
territories

failure the national highway traffic safety administration said 
friday

accept women as priests and even consecrate them as bishops 
an even higher percentage of church of england members in the

archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual head of the 
church of england has warned that the issue could split not just 
britains state church but anglican churches worldwide 
the poll published friday in londons daily telegraph 
newspaper was based on interviews with 1021 britons this month 
the church of england has an allmale priesthood in the last 11 
years a minority of the 26 selfgoverning anglican churches in 
other countries including the 25million member us episcopal 
church have ordained more than 1000 women as priests the us 
church and those in canada and new zealand are considering 
consecrating the first women bishops this year

womens role issue at the churchs general synod on july 5 
the synod voted 299216 to draft legislation allowing ordination 
of women the breakdown of votes was bishops 2821 clergy 137102

the federal government offered its 
elite antiterrorist force to stop a 54hour crosscountry hostage 
ordeal in which three people were killed a spokesman said friday 
but state officials chose another plan 
the revelation came as criticism heightened of state officials 
handling of the terror spree by two bank robbers and a woman 
accomplice 
the incident ended thursday in a gunfight with police on a 
superhighway near bonn that killed a hostage 
killed earlier were a 15yearold italian boy hostage shot by 
the criminals at a highway rest area and a police officer who 
perished in a car crash while pursuing the bandits 
michael butz spokesman for the federal interior ministry told 
reporters the gsg9 antiterrorist force was offered to north 
rhinewestphalia state officials 
instead the state officials assigned a police commando unit to 
stop the robbers the commandos rammed the getaway car and in an 
ensuing gun battle one of the hostages inside the car 18yearold 
silke bischof was killed 
state officials said friday they were sure she was killed by one 
of the two bank robbers identified as dieter degowski and 
hansjuergen roesner and not by police gunfire 
asked about the states decision not to use the gsg9 butz 
replied only the legal situation in which the states have 
responsibility for police deployments must be respected 
at a preliminatry court hearing friday night degowski admitted 
that he fatally shot the italian boy according to the cologne 
radio station rundfunk it quoted a court official who was not 
identified and gave no further details 
federal education minister juergen moellemann was among the 
politicians who criticized north rhinewestphalia officials for not 
making use of the gsg9 
the initials stand for grenzschutzgruppeunit 9 or federal 
border guard troopsunit 9 which gained fame by rescuing 86 
passengers held by terrorists on a lufthansa airliner on oct 13 
1977 at mogadishu somalia 
moellemann said the north rhinewestphalia states interior 
minister herbert schnoor and the interior minister for the 
citystate of bremen bernd meyer should resign 
it is totally unconceivable why actions were not taken 
sooner moellemann told the bild newspaper there were plenty 
of opportunities to do so 
the ordeal began tuesday morning when two men robbed a bank in 
the northwestern town of gladbeck escalated on wednesday with the 
seizure of a bremen bus with 30 people on board and ended thursday 
with the shootout 
most of the ordeal occurred in the citystate of bremen and 
north rhinewestphalia but the gunmen also drove the bus across 
the border into the netherlands then returned to west germany 
schnoor said he took political responsibility for the 
handling of the situation by north rhinewestphalia law officials 
and he rejected allegations they bungled the job 
he said on west german radio it is impossible to foresee what 
will be the end result before all the cards have been put on the 
table 
meyer spokesman volker backhaus also defended bremen officials 
handling of the situation 
there were times when roesner and his female friend were 
outside the bus giving interviews to reporters but the other 
gunman was inside the bus threatening the hostages he said 
reinhard schmidtkuentzel a spokesman for the north 
rhinewestphalia interior ministry said that in the final 
shootout miss bischof was shot in the heart a second woman 
hostage was grazed by a bullet on the back roesner was shot in the 
thigh and degowski and a female accomplice marion irma loeblich 
were unhurt

sen dan quayle insisted friday that he 
broke no rules to get into the indiana national guard during the 
vietnam war but acknowledged that a family friend probably made 
calls on his behalf after quayle expressed interest 
i got in fairly the republican vice presidential nominee 
insisted at an outdoor news conference after a rousing rally in his 
home town 
a crowd of thousands that heard the questions over a public 
address system jeered reporters and chanted quayle quayle in 
support of the senators responses 
the 41yearold quayle had refused throughout the week to answer 
media questions about whether strings were pulled to get him into 
the guard and avoid the draft during the vietnam war 
fridays news conference was his first accounting of the chain 
of events leading to his enrollment in the guard he portrayed it 
as a normal occurance given his relationship with his family and 
their friends 
i did not ask anyone to break the rules and so far as i know 
no one did quayle said 
the indianapolis news had reported thursday that wendell c 
phillippi former managing editor of the newspaper which is part 
of quayles grandfathers publishing chain had called the guard on 
quayles behalf phillippi was a former commander of the state 
national guard and a family friend 
wendell phillippi knew that i wanted to get into the national 
guard and i hope that he helped me and i think he did quayle 
told reporters i would hope that he helped me and i expect 
that 
quayle said he initially called his parents to discuss his 
desire to enter the national guard as a senior in college he faced 
the loss of his colleage student deferment upon graduation 
asked why he did not just go down and fill out papers if his 
entry into the guard was as routine as he suggested it was quayle 
said 
i do what any normal person would do at that age you call 
home you call home to mother and father and say id like to get 
in the national guard 
he said his conversation with phillippi was brief and that he 
did not ask phillipi to make any calls on his behalf i told him 
i wanted to get into the national guard i would assume calls would 
be made i talked to mr phillippi very briefly i hope that he 
helped me and i think he did 
quayle said he saw nothing wrong with that and added that he 
resented questions implying that joining the guard was less of a 
military service to his country 
the implication is somehow that dan quale by voluntarily 
signing up for the indiana national guard was somehow not patriotic 
and i resent that he said 
asked to assess the way he proceeded as a 22yearold he said 
i would not have done anything differently if he had known he 
would be running for vice president one day 
questions about the circumstances surrounding quayles 
enlistment in the national guard in 1969 continued to overshadow 
george bushs presidential campaign and dog quayle just a day after 
he was nominated for the no 2 spot on the ticket 
quayle said he did not offer to have bush withdraw his name for 
the vice presidential spot on the ticket saying he did not think 
there was any reason for that 
bush and quayle had just concluded their first joint campaign 
rally on the front steps of the courthouse when the vice president 
walked away and quayle approached reporters standing behind a rope 
line 
quayle took a combative hard line with reporters during an 
extraordinary 20minute impromptu news conference on the courthouse 
lawn 
the giveandtake was broadcast to people at the rally site with 
an amplifier system and quayle supporters cheered his answers and 
booed reporters seeking to question his military past at one 
point the crowd started chanting boring boring 
quayle said he planned to make his military records available 
but didnt say when he also said he did not believe he deceived 
bush campaign organization officials when questioned about this 
during the screening process that preceded his selection for the 
ticket 
a highranking campaign official insisted to reporters that the 
unusual news conference was not a setup he said the session 
was amplified to the crowd because there were several reporters on 
a separate platform who otherwise could not hear quayle 
quayle who said he had reservations about the vietnam war as 
many people in his generation did said he could have been called 
to vietnam as many indiana units were and if i had been called i 
would have gone 
no i did not join to avoid service in vietnam he said 
quayle said it was perfectly normal for a young man of 22 to talk 
to talk about joining the guard or making any other decision 
asked if the uproar over his military background would harm the 
prospects for the bush ticket quayle said he thought it would do 
the opposite saying millions of people who have served in the 
national guard are offended by suggestions that he joined to avoid 
duty in vietnam 
quayle said he did not know whether there were any vacancies in 
the guard at the time he sought to join 
during a joint appearance with bush earlier friday in new 
orleans before members of the republican national committee 
quayle said he had learned something about how to conduct himself 
in that convention city then he snapped his heels together and 
came to attention and did a military precisionstyle delivery of 
name rank and serial number

the sister of american hostage terry 
anderson said in a statement published friday that his kidnappers 
were unjust in insisting that he will be released only when peace 
comes to lebanon 
in a related development the beirut weekly ashshiraa said 
british hostages probably will be released soon but that the 
release of german and us hostages will take more time 
in the past 3 years i have tried my very best to pressure my 
government to negotiate for terrys release and the release of the 
other hostages andersons sister peggy say said in her message 
you have now presented new demands which are impossible for me 
to put forth to my government wrote mrs say who lives in 
kentucky 
the text of the message was published by beiruts two leading 
daily newspapers annahar and assafir 
eighteen foreigners including nine americans are missing and 
believed kidnapped in lebanon 
the proiranian islamic jihad or islamic holy war which holds 
anderson 40 and american hostage thomas sutherland 56 released 
a statement thursday that set four demands for their release 
two of the demands were new the unconditional withdrawal of all 
israeli forces and their christian militia allies from south 
lebanon and us aid for the reconstruction of warravaged south 
lebanon and beirut 
the group also demanded the release of all lebanese and 
palestinian mujahedeen or holy warriors from prisons in christian 
east beirut as well as in israel and its selfdesignated security 
zone 
israel and allied militiamen of the south lebanon army control a 
10miledeep enclave in south lebanon to prevent crossborder 
guerrilla forays 
unlike many of its previous communications the shiite moslem 
faction did not specifically ask for the release of 17 suspects 
held in kuwait for bombing the us and french embassies in 1983 
i think it is grossly unjust for you to hold terry anderson 
for ransom that includes what amounts to a complete peace 
settlement in the entire region and the end of centuriesold 
hostilities mrs say stated 
in washington state department deputy spokeswoman phyllis 
oakley reiterated us policy against making deals for hostages 
we believe that arrangements that reward hostage takers only 
encourage more terrorism she said 
anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press was kidnapped march 16 1985 sutherland acting dean of 
agriculture at the american university of beirut was grabbed june 
9 1985 
an anonymous caller on wednesday claimed islamic jihad was also 
holding anglican church envoy terry waite 48 who disappeared jan 
20 1987 while in beirut to negotiate with the group on releasing 
the american hostages there was no way to verify the claim 
ashshiraa quoting an unidentified west beirut leader involved 
in contacts under way to free foreign hostages in lebanon said 
these contacts have made much progress 
it said two sets of negotiations were being carried on 
separately the first involving the release of waite and two 
british hostages the second concerning the release of west german 
captive rudolf cordes and the american hostages 
it said the case of the british hostages was cooking on a high 
burner while the affair of cordes and the american hostages is 
cooking on a slow burner 
the report in ashshiraa which broke the story of us secret 
arms sale to iran in november 1986 could not be independently 
verified the magazines previous stories about the hostages have 
not proved accurate 
cordes 53 beirut manager for hoechst ag one of west germanys 
largest chemical companies was kidnapped jan 17 1987 the 
proiranian holy warriors for freedom claimed his abduction 
ashshiraa said the kidnappers were seeking a huge sum of money 
to be paid to them and and at the same time economic military 
and political conditions set by iran would be met it did not 
elaborate 
in addition to waite britain seeks the release of journalist 
john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan a belfast man with dual 
british and irish nationality whose release is also sought by the 
irish government 
the foreign office says it also seeks word on alec collett a 
new yorkbased british journalist whose palestinian abductors claim 
they killed him his body was never found 
british government sources in london said friday that the first 
british diplomat sent to iran for a year has not been allowed to 
visit two britons jailed without trial 
earlier the british broadcasting corp reported that diplomat 
david reddaways mission has run into trouble 
reddaway went to iran soon after the church of england held 
talks with an iranian envoy over the british hostages in lebanon 
the talks and the reddaway mission raised hopes that the hostages 
might be released 
british government sources speaking on condition of anonymity 
said they were disappointed by irans continued refusal to allow 
reddaway to see businessman roger cooper who has been in prison in 
iran nearly three years and tourist nicholas nicola

a japanese man arrested on explosives 
charges and linked by investigators to a leftwing terrorist group 
pleaded innocent friday to a revised indictment 
yu kikumura 36 was arrested april 12 at a rest stop on the new 
jersey turnpike after a state police trooper found three homemade 
bombs in his car 
after his arrest us authorities linked kikumura to the 
terrorist japanese red army 
kikumura is accused of transporting explosives interstate 
without a permit transporting explosives interstate by an illegal 
alien possession of an unregistered firearm using a false 
passport and other charges he could face 100 years in prison if 
convicted on all counts 
defense attorney ronald kuby filed two motions with us 
district judge alfred j lechner asking that the charges be 
dismissed 
kuby argued that prosecutors obtained the new indictment to 
avoid the certain dismissal of at least four charges in the 
original indictment 
to all appearances the governments action certainly seemed 
designed to punish a pesky defendant for exercising his legal 
rights he contended 
lechner set a sept 9 date for arguing the motions he also set 
a trial date of sept 27 
kikumura was led into the courtroom under heavy security 
handcuffed and in leg irons prompting a protest from defense 
attorney ronald kuby lechner agreed to allow the leg irons to be 
taken off but kikumura remained handcuffed throughout the 
25minute hearing

most americans believe that dan quayles service 
in the national guard should not be a campaign issue but voters 
are split on whether it should be an issue if it turns out he used 
family influence to get into the guard a poll released friday said 
the abc news poll found in a random sample of 613 registered 
voters thursday night that 63 percent said the fact that the gop 
vice presidential candidate entered the national guard at a time 
when others faced possible service in vietnam should not be a 
campaign issue 
about 23 percent said they thought it should be a minor issue 
and 11 percent thought it should be a major issue according to the 
poll which had an margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage 
points 
but if influence was used 23 percent said quayles national 
guard service should be a major issue and 27 percent said it should 
be a minor issue while 47 percent said it should not be a campaign 
issue 
seventyfour percent said quayles decision to join the national 
guard will have no effect on how they vote 17 percent said they 
are now less likely to vote republican and 4 percent are more 
likely to vote for the gop ticket 
but if quayle got into the national guard because of outside 
influence the number of those who would be less likely to vote for 
george bush and quayle jumps to 31 percent the poll found 
nearly threequarters of those who say they are less likely to 
vote for bush if influence was used were probably going to vote for 
the democratic ticket anyway the poll said

the chairman of texas air corp friday 
defended a decision by the companys subsidiary eastern airlines 
to lay off 4000 employees and cut service as a way to stabilize 
the company by cutting losses 
frank lorenzo testifying at a federal court hearing on 
easterns plans to eliminate service to 14 cities said the layoffs 
and schedule changes were a necessary step to save the financially 
troubled carrier 
if easterns management is not permitted to take the actions 
to save this company then eastern may run out of cash lorenzo 
said rejecting suggestions by union attorneys that he was trying 
to bust organized labor at eastern by transferring the carriers 
assets to continental airlines another texas air property 
three labor unions that represent eastern employees have 
challenged the plans and obtained a temporary restraining order 
that bars the airline from making layoffs 
us district judge barrington d parker is holding hearings on 
the unions bid for a permanent injunction 
lorenzo defended the proposed cutbacks as an attempt to 
stabilize the company and decrease the losses 
eastern currently is in federally supervised contract 
negotiations with two of its unions the association of air line 
pilots and the international association of machinists and 
aerospace workers 
lorenzo denied suggestions that texas air planned to merge 
easterns operations into continental 
union attorneys produced a draft of a speech that lorenzo was to 
give to japanese investors in 1986 after texas air had purchased 
eastern 
the draft said that the purchase of eastern gave texas air 
leverage over the unions easterns airplanes can be repainted 
and moved over to continental where they will be flown by nonunion 
pilots the speech draft said 
but lorenzo said the draft was prepared by an investment banking 
firm it was unclear from the testimony if lorenzo ever delivered 
that portion of the speech

a judge who killed himself in a deserted 
courthouse hallway after he learned details were being published 
about his alleged sexual misconduct felt hounded by the press and 
unable to bear it anymore a friend said 
king county superior court judge gary m little was found dead 
thursday night of a selfinflicted gunshot wound to the head 
officials said 
he left a note saying i have chosen to take my life its an 
appropriate end to the present situation 
in the past six years little has been officially criticized or 
disciplined over improper contacts with juvenile defendants 
but rumors persisted of more serious sexual misconduct leading 
a political challenger to raise those contacts as a campaign issue 
this year and reporters from several news organizations to pursue 
reports little had used his influence to coerce young men into sex 
little 49 a judge since 1980 announced last month that he 
would not seek a third term acknowledging that innuendo about his 
work with teenage boys was the reason he said he planned to move 
to california and work outside law 
little whose father committed suicide when he was 8 shot 
himself about an hour before the presses at the seattle 
postintelligencer started printing fridays editions which 
contained more than three full pages outlining allegations by five 
men three of them former students of littles that he had 
coerced them into having sex with him 
the seattle times also reported friday that it had been 
investigating little and had interviewed more than 80 people 
he said he felt hed been hounded by the press and he just 
couldnt take it anymore said attorney camden hall a friend of 
little who spoke to him by telephone just minutes before the judge 
died it was too much pressure the hounding wouldnt stop 
he was not only driven into disgrace but to death said hal 
foster an art history professor and author who was interviewed 
from paris by telephone by the times 
foster took littles law class at private lakeside school in the 
1970s and said there was no sexual contact involving him and that 
he wasnt aware of any with his classmates 
he was tried out of court on suspicions about his sexuality 
that to me is reactionary its scary foster said 
postintelligencer executive editor jd alexander said in a 
news release that littles death is a tragedy that touches the 
community at several levels certainly the most tragic is the loss 
of a human life 
the newspapers investigation was warranted the statement said 
because of a conspiracy of silence in key levels of the 
community about littles behavior 
there was no indication of relief no indication that the 
system that had failed these victims would or could serve the 
public any better in the future the statement said 
a janitor found littles body a 38caliber pistol and a note 
were found with the body said vaughn van zant an investigator 
with the king county medical examiner 
the onepage handwritten note addressed to no specific 
individual was found on a hallway bench van zant said the 
medical examiner would not release its contents but the times 
reported the note said 
i have chosen to take my life its an appropriate end to the 
present situation i had hoped that my decision to withdraw from 
the election and leave public life would have closed the matter 
apparently these steps are not satisfactory to those who feel more 
is required so be it i will say one final time that i am proud of 
my efforts and accomplishments as a superior court judge i am 
deeply appreciative of those who have wished me well these past few 
weeks 
the judge was disciplined twice concerning improper contacts he 
had with youths who appeared before him in court 
in april 1985 after a complaint little was barred from the 
juvenile court bench by the presiding judge and the superior court 
executive committee because of such improper contacts such as 
buying young defendants clothing and books 
in 1982 the state commission on judicial conduct also privately 
admonished little the commission had received a complaint as early 
as 1981 from the king county prosecutors office that little was 
violating the code of judicial conduct by having outofcourt 
contact with juvenile offenders and the prosecutors office 
followed up with a second report in 1983 the times reported 
the commissions action was not made public until 1985 little 
had been reelected in 1984 
two of the men who told the postintelligencer that little had 
sex with them when they were teenagers said they gave long 
statements to the commission years later one in 1981 and the other 
in 1985 
but the commission apparently never acted on those statements 
because it had adopted a policy not to pursue allegations of 
misconduct that allegedly occurred before the commission was formed 
in december 1980 
the commissions chairman colfax attorney wesley a nuxoll 
said he thinks the commissions confidential proceedings are 
necessary to encourage people to come forward with complaints and 
speak freely about them 
he also said he would have reservations about modifying the rule 
against considering pre1980 cases and thinks it would be a 
serious mistake to make all complaints public

loma linda university medical center 
has quietly suspended a program to harvest organs of infants born 
with most of their brains missing after 13 failed attempts to make 
the program work officials said 
the hospital will honor prior commitments to attempt organ 
harvesting in two unborn anencephalic infants but no other infants 
will be accepted in the immediate future officials said 
the decision last month to stop the program was never announced 
but dr joyce l peabody loma lindas chief of neonatology 
disclosed the decision during a discussion at an aug 10 bioethics 
seminar in oakland 
a tape recording of the discussion was obtained by the los 
angeles times which published details friday 
certainly if the only outcome you are looking at is the 
number of solid organs transplanted our program has failed and 
failed dismally ms peabody said on the tape 
officials at loma linda refused to comment friday a spokesman 
said a news conference would be called monday or tuesday 
the programs future will be determined after completion of a 
report ms peabody is preparing for medical center officials the 
times reported 
anencephalics are born missing sections of the brain and skull 
most die at birth or shortly thereafter 
it takes a particular amount of courage to acknowledge that 
you may have made a mistake said leslie rothenberg a faculty 
member at the university of californialos angeles medical center 
and a medical ethics specialist who had criticized the loma linda 
program 
the program began last december two months after renowned loma 
linda surgeon dr leonard bailey transplanted a heart from an 
anencephalic child declared brain dead in canada 
anencephalics are used as organ donors in canada and western 
europe but loma linda had the only such program in the united 
states 
the hospitals guidelines for using anencephalics required that 
the babies meet medical criteria that would declare them brain dead 
within seven days of their entry into the program 
of the first seven babies taking part in the hospitals program 
one was a stillborn and five failed to meet the criteria 
no suitable recipient could be found for the organs of the one 
baby that did meet the braindeath requirements and was thus 
eligible as a donor 
five of the next six babies reached imminent death within a 
week of birth but four were determined to be unsuitable as donors

a federal appeals court ruled friday that the 
reagan administration had not justified its failure to replace with 
new examinations a civil service test that was found to 
discriminate against minorities 
the us circuit court of appeals here said the office of 
personnel management acted arbitrarily and capriciously when 
did not provide figures to document its claim it would be too 
costly to devise new tests 
but the threejudge panel said opm should be given another 
opportunity to justify the decision to the judge who ordered the 
agency to devise new tests for college graduates seeking 
entrylevel federal jobs 
the decision came in a case brought by the national treasury 
employees union that challenged opms decision to hire employees 
for entrylevel positions under a noncompetitive provision of the 
civil service law 
that provision gives government agencies discretion to hire 
employees noncompetitively 
the employees union objected to the procedure because the 
employees hired under the provision did not receive all the 
protections afforded other civilservice workers 
the dispute arose after the goverment signed a consent decree in 
1982 to phase out the professional and administrative career 
examination to settle a lawsuit claiming the test discriminated 
unfairly against minorities 
us district judge joyce hens green ordered opm to devise new 
examinations to cover specific jobs and to implement the new tests 
in six months she stayed her order to give the government an 
opportunity to appeal the decision 
the appeals court in an opinion by circuit judge douglas h 
ginsburg sided with greens finding that she had jurisdiction to 
examine opms decision and with the conclusion it was arbitrarily 
and capricious 
opm did not have any evidence so far as the record reveals 
of how much it would cost to develop the necessary examinations 
ginsburg wrote in an opinion joined by circuit judges patricia wald 
and harry edwards 
unable to point us to any data of the sort it would have 
considered if it had considered cost in any meaningful way opm 
urges us to defer to its expert judgment regarding the cost of 
developing new examinations 
there is no indication in the record however that opm ever 
made an expert judgment about what those costs would be ginsburg 
wrote 
opm spokesman dick mcgowan said the agency would not comment on 
the decision 
in june opm administrator constance horner announced a new 
program of using campus recruiters to hire college graduates based 
on their academic records and interviews horner said the agency 
would also devise competitive examinations for students who did not 
have high enough grades to be hired through interviews 
the treasury employees union has filed a new suit to challenge 
the proposal contending it will not result in competitive hiring 
the unions president robert tobias said fridays decision 
means that opm can no longer ignore their obligation to develop 
an alternative system

about 5500 workers at the state 
power company stayed out on strike friday to demand the release of 
an arrested union leader a union source said 
the source said 40 workers at the institute of electrification 
and hydraulic resources were arrested tuesday when they cut service 
to three progovernment newspapers and a television station which 
together owed about 500000 in unpaid bills 
the cutoff was not authorized by management the source said he 
spoke on condition of not being identified fearing reprisals 
he said 39 of those arrested were freed thursday night but the 
general secretary of the electrical workers union isaac 
rodriguez remained in jail 
union members who spoke also on condition of anonymity said 
the 39 were freed after union leaders met with gen manuel antonio 
noriega head of the 15000member defense forces and panamas de 
facto ruler 
the members refused to give details of the meeting but said the 
workers and government agreed to set up a threemember committee to 
direct the utility with representatives from the armed forces 
management and labor 
they said rodriguez was on a hunger strike at modelo prison in 
panama city and that relatives and friends were kept from visiting 
him 
but a prison official told the associated press on friday that 
rodriguez no longer is here he did not say where rodriguez was 
the union source said that virtually all of the institutes 
5500 workers walked off the job tuesday after the arrests and 
vowed not to return until rodriguez is freed 
the walkout delayed maintenance and repair work but the 
nations power supply was not affected 
the source said rodriguez and the others cut electricity to 
editorial renovacion which publishes the newspapers critica 
matutino and la republica to protest administrative and financial 
difficulties at the institute they say were caused in part by the 
firms failure to pay 
matutino did not publish wednesday but resumed publication on 
thursday operations at the other newspapers were unaffected 
the workers also tried to cut service to channel 2 national 
television but it was not affected 
the union members complained that the institute usually cuts off 
service when the poor do not pay their bills but extends credit to 
big companies that are influential with the government

an israeli middleman in the irancontra 
armsselling scandal said in an article friday that the united 
states made a horrendous blunder in trying to buy the release 
of american hostages held in lebanon 
yaacov nimrodi in 1985 helped arrange shipments of us 
weapons to iran some of the profits went to nicaraguan rebels 
known as contras fighting the sandinista government 
the scheme was carried out despite a us ban on arms sales to 
iran at war with iraq and the lack of congressional approval for 
military aid to the contras 
israel helped deliver the arms to iran and said it was acting at 
the request of the united states which hoped to obtain the release 
of americans kidnapped in lebanon by proiranian extremists 
the article by nimrodi was published in the jerusalem post 
he said that in 1985 he and israeli collegues al schwimmer and 
david kimchi found the key to iran made the right connections 
with the right people and put them at the disposal of the us 
unfortunately a horrendous blunder was made nimrodi wrote 
in a rare public statement on the arms deal instead of homing in 
on the political dimension the contacts in a most natural way 
were permitted to spill over to talks on the release of hostages in 
exchange for us arms 
nimrodi said he believes president reagan hopes to secure the 
release of the american hostages before his term ends in january 
but added that focusing on the issue of the captives is apt to 
raise the price the iranians will demand and make the release of 
the hostages more difficult 
it is to be hoped that today the american and israeli 
foreign policymakers have learned from past mistakes and will 
navigate their contacts with iran so as to restore iran to its 
natural place the place where it wants to be and ought to be 
much closer to the west nimrodi wrote 
the west will then achieve three years later what we sought 
to achieve then 
eighteen foreigners including nine americans are held captive 
in lebanon by moslem militants terry anderson chief middle east 
correspondent for the associated press has been held the longest 
he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
nimrodi 61 lived in iran for 25 years first as an agent for 
israels mossad intelligence agency and then as a military attache 
and a private businessman 
nimrodi wrote that for the first time since the irancontra 
scandal the united states and iran appear on the verge of improving 
their relations 
he also said irans daring decision to agree to a ceasefire 
with iraq in their eightyearold war indicates more than 
anything else that beyond what appears to be the irrational 
uncompromising and fanatical policy of the iranian rulers a 
significant amount of logic and pragmatism can be discovered

amendments to the constitution went into 
effect friday giving president daniel arap moi greater control 
over the judiciary and broadening the arrest powers of the police 
the amendments were printed friday in a supplement to the kenya 
gazette 
parliament voted unanimously aug 2 to amend the constitution to 
empower the president to fire a high court judge or court of 
appeals judge without reason and without having to go through a 
tribunal process 
it gave the head of state the same power to fire members of the 
public service commission 
parliament also changed the constitution to allow police to hold 
a capital crime suspect for 14 days instead of the previous 24 
hours before bringing him to court 
traditionally there is a 14day waiting period between the time 
a constitutional change is proposed and debate in parliament but 
the measures sailed through the chamber unopposed five days after 
the attorney general proposed them 
lawyers and clergymen fought the changes saying they would 
erode the checks and balances between the executive and the 
judiciary and undermine individual liberties 
kenya by law is a oneparty state and approval of the 
constitutional changes had been expected

a federal appeals court friday supported 
a judges order imposing a property tax increase to finance kansas 
city school desegregation but said the judge overstepped his 
authority when he imposed an income tax surcharge 
gov john ashcroft criticized the 8th us circuit court of 
appeals ruling saying it is one more step toward the day when 
federal judges control more and more institutions in our society 
our prisons schools and social services programs 
us district judge russell g clark ordered the tax increases 
in september 1987 to pay for desegregation in the kansas city 
school district the money also was for construction of new schools 
that could lure white students from the suburbs and private schools 
many of the citys school buildings have literally rotted 
clark said about threequarters of the students are minorities 
about twothirds of them are black 
clark ordered the tax increases when no money was available to 
finance the construction of new schools and after voters in the 
district turned down six proposals to increase taxes for education 
between 1970 and 1983 
he ordered that taxes on property in the school district be 
almost doubled and that people who worked in kansas city whether 
or not they lived there pay a 15 percent state income tax 
surcharge 
missouri attorney general william webster appealed clarks 
order among those filing briefs opposing the taxes were the 
justice department the state of kansas and us sen john 
danforth rmo 
in its ruling friday the appeals court dismissed the states 
contention that clark exceeded his judicial authority in imposing 
the property tax increase 
the threemember panel in st louis said it holds that federal 
courts powers to remedy the evils of segregation include a 
narrowly defined power to order increases in local tax levies on 
real estate 
the court said it had ruled in another case that a federal court 
could impose such a tax increase only after exploration of every 
other fiscal alternative 
but noting that the property tax is the established source of 
revenue for missouris school districts the court said clark could 
not impose a state income tax surcharge because it restructures 
the states scheme of school financing and creates an entirely new 
form of taxing authority 
we are satisfied that the district court invaded the province 
of the legislature in ordering this surcharge the appellate 
court ruled adding that unspent revenues must be refunded 
the appeals court dismissed the states contention that the 
federal judge had exceeded his authority in imposing the property 
tax increase

a series of underground explosions 
ripped through this seacoast city friday damaging two houses and 
forcing 200 people to evacuate their homes and businesses 
authorities said no one was injured 
i heard a loud explosion i looked out the sewer manhole 
cover blew off the ground said merchant patricia genest none 
of us knew what was going on at all people were running away from 
sewers and manhole covers 
it sounded like bombs going off it was one manhole right 
after the other said gas station owner john curley the 
explosions took place about a quarter mile from the citys downtown 
and not far from a famous statue of a fisherman 
the explosions apparently were caused by gasoline in the sewer 
system said fire chief barry mckay 
mayor william squillace declared a state of emergency at 530 
pm but lifted it about two hours later 
we seem to have everything under control he said about 9 
pm five hours after the blasts weve done a reading in the 
sewer system of the possibility of an explosion and there is no 
danger of an explosion all of the systems have been vented 
we had a series of underground explosions about 10 right in 
a row and now theyre evacuating the area and its causing a 
major traffic jam said police officer merrill newman the 
telephone just lit up like a christmas tree and people were almost 
hysterical 
gloucester fire capt louis aiello said six trucks responded to 
the alarms 
authorities suspect the explosions were set off by the removal 
of a gasoline tank from a petroleum products distribution yard 
mckay said 
there was a company removing a gasoline tank upstream of the 
sewer system he said state and federal investigators will try 
to determine whether the gasoline was the source of the explosions 
and how it might have entered the sewer system he said 
a strong smell of gasoline hovered in the area hours after the 
explosions 
smoke and some flames were visible after the explosions but 
officials said any fires in the sewer system apparently 
extinguished themselves 
officials said they believe the gasoline caused about 20 manhole 
covers to blow as it traveled through the sewer system 
builtup pressure vented at two houses causing some structural 
damage the blast cracked a concrete patio at the home of pat 
cusick 32 a construction worker it also broke his 35foot 
concrete driveway into chunks the size of telephone books 
im a nervous wreck cusick said surveying the damage and 
holding up five wooden steps leading to his back door that broke 
loose in the blast he said he was driving toward home when he saw 
a manhole cover blow i saw flames shoot right out of the 
manhole 
cusick said he was glad he did not arrive home sooner i would 
have been parked right here he said pointing to the shattered 
driveway 
at a house across the street half the front lawn was ripped up 
a crack ran along the foundation and the sidewalk was ruptured a 
3foot high wall made of cinder blocks had fallen 
its amazing that nobody got killed said acting fire capt 
john hautalla 
while police earlier said hundreds of people were evacuated from 
a 10block area to a school fire department spokesman clarence 
rudolph said only 200 people were evacuated from a fourblock area 
near downtown 
most of the people who were told to leave their homes went to 
the houses of friends or relatives or stood by police barriers and 
watched said charles thomas a director of the local red cross 
only about a dozen came to the school 
by nightfall people were being allowed to return to their homes 
behind fire officials who checked manholes for more flammable 
substances

a college professor who admitted he made a 
racially and sexually offensive remark to a student was suspended 
without pay thursday for the fall quarter 
georgia southwestern college professor allen towery who 
verbally attacked the student during a heated argument march 7 can 
resume teaching when the winter quarter begins in january 
at that time i will allow dr towery to return to teaching 
but only after he has submitted a correction plan which will 
include measures to improve his performance in the specific areas 
for which discipline is being administered said school president 
william h capitan 
capitan originally sought to have towery fired 
towery 49 a tenured associate professor of english said he 
was provoked into making the statement to ginevra dennis 18 but 
other students later complained about racist or sexist remarks he 
allegedly made 
testimony at a disciplinary hearing in june showed ms dennis 
had gone to towerys office to demand a withdrawn passing grade 
in his class rather than a failing grade 
capitan suspended towery with pay shortly after the incident 
and later instituted dismissal proceedings 
a fivemember committee heard testimony in june and cleared 
towery of violating a state board of regents policy however the 
committee suggested that towery be barred from teaching freshmen 
capitan considered the committees recommendation and decided 
to suspend towery 
towery said thursday he would confer with his attorney gene 
black jr of albany before deciding whether to appeal 
towery declined further comment but black said he may seek a 
federal court injunction blocking the suspension because it could 
not be appealed to the regents before fall quarter classes begin

protest of white house policy on aids victims has died of cardiac

companion michael s macpherson said thursday 
the duties of the civil rights office include preventing 
discrimination against people who are handicapped when he resigned

aids was not considered to be necessarily a handicapped position

civil rights laws macpherson said

china and the soviet union will hold talks in 
beijing on aug 27 to seek solutions to the cambodian conflict and 
improvement in strained chinesesoviet relations foreign ministry 
spokesman jin guihua said thursday he said at a weekly briefing 
that the talks will focus on cambodia and will be led by soviet 
vice foreign minister igor rogachev and his chinese counterpart 
tian zengpei the meeting is expected to last several days 
the chinese will be in a listening mode said one western 
diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity theyll be waiting 
to see what the soviets have to offer 
he said the chinese remain skeptical about a quick solution to 
the cambodian conflict he added however that if moscow and 
beijing can come to terms on cambodia there would be a lot of 
movement toward the normalization process of chinesesoviet 
relations 
moscow is the main backer of vietnam in its 9yearold military 
occupation of cambodia beijing is chief supporter of the communist 
khmer rouge and the other antivietnamese resistance forces in 
cambodia 
communist vietnam has pledged to withdraw 50000 troops or 
about half its force in cambodia this year and the rest by early 
1990 
both china and the soviet union have expressed support for a 
peaceful political solution in cambodia they are expected to seek 
ways to bring about a vietnamese withdrawal without leaving the 
nation vulnerable to a takeover by the khmer rouge who launched a 
reign of terror during their 197578 rule 
although it has supported the khmer rouge china has agreed that 
the group should not dominate a future coalition government but 
china also rejects vietnams attempts to link its military 
withdrawal to dismantling khmer rouge forces 
the beijing meeting could also help shape the future of 
chinesesoviet relations 
china stresses that it will fully normalize political relations 
with the soviet union only when the kremlin takes action to end 
vietnams presence in cambodia 
ties between the two communist giants have been strained since 
they split over ideological and strategic differences in the early 
1960s 
political normalization talks have gone on since 1982 but 
bogged down with chinas objecting to soviet military strength on 
the common border the soviet invasion of afghanistan and cambodia 
the communist party general secretary zhao ziyang told 
japanese journalists tuesday that the first chinesesoviet summit 
meeting since the breakdown of relations was possible if moscow 
first urges vietnam to leave cambodia 
the western diplomat estimated that at least a 50 percent chance 
exists that 1989 will see a chinesesoviet summit which probably 
would bring soviet leader mikhail gorbachev to beijing to meet 
chinas senior leader deng xiaoping

adolph coors co said thursday an 
autopsy performed on a mouse a man claimed he found in a beer can 
shows it did not get there at the brewery 
but a pathologist hired by james harvey who said he discovered 
the rodent in a 16ounce can of coors on july 29 said the autopsy 
was only slighly more scientific than tealeaf reading 
coors officials released a report from university of florida 
veterinary pathologist claus buergelt who performed a 
courtordered autopsy on the mouse 
the tests performed by the university of florida clearly prove 
that the mouse did not get into the can in golden colo said 
cary baird a coors spokeswoman 
she said the examination did not disclose the cause of death but 
showed the mouse was dead approximately one week or less when the 
necropsy was conducted 
the beer was packaged on may 13 some 77 days before harvey 
reported finding the animal to coors 
but pathologist ed willey who was hired by harveys attorney 
disputed the findings on the time of the rodents death 
willey said that because the mouse had been kept in beer it 
would have decomposed more slowly than it would have at a natural 
rate 
i suggest that the only appropriate interpretation of dr 
buergelts findings is that the death of the mouse was at least one 
week prior to autopsy and possibly several days or more prior to 
the canning of the product willey said 
ms baird said experts were asked to determine if the condition 
of the mouse was consistent with one that had been in a beer can 
for that time 
the answer is a resounding no she said 
a creature that had been in a sealed can of beer since may 13 
when this can was packaged would show more evidence of 
decomposition than this sample she said 
there was a oneweek lapse from the time harvey reported his 
find to coors until the mouse was examined 
although the report indicates that the mouse was dead less 
than one week it is critical to note here that the sample was 
frozen at least twice during the week freezing greatly retards 
decompostion thus making the reported time frame consistent with 
how the sample was actually handled she said 
harvey 30 an unemployed construction worker told the media he 
found the mouse after sipping a coors beer and becoming ill he and 
a television crew took the can to the jacksonville health 
department on aug 3 officials there cut the can open and poured 
out its contents which included a dead mouse 
harveys attorney gary pajcic said that his client is out of 
state and would not be available for comment

the odds the government is putting on an end 
to the drought over the next couple of months would likely be of 
little interest to even the most dedicated riverboat gambler 
the probability of getting enough rain to end the drought ranges 
from 1 in 500 for central iowa to 1 in 1000 for at least three 
other major drought regions the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration reports 
in central iowa for example the amount of rain needed by oct 
31 to end the drought totals 2242 inches that amount can be 
expected in the augustoctober period only once in 500 years the 
advisory said 
the other three all came out to one chance in 1000 of getting 
enough rain by the end of october to declare the drought broken 
those areas are northeastern montana near the north dakota border

the bumper stickers bragged nothing could 
be finer than to eat at diggers diner now its a diner to go 
anyone willing to flip flapjacks and hamburgers and pay the 
cost of moving it can have the 1940svintage restaurant free of 
charge says william digger young 
he grew tired of the diner chores because he also was juggling 
jobs as a mortician butler county coroner and clown on roller 
skates at childrens hospitals and nursing homes 
its just that i wore too many hats id put an apron on 
over my suit and pour coffee you didnt catch me cooking but id 
be running the cash register i liked to be where the money was 
he said 
young 55 got his nickname from the funeral business his family 
has owned since 1896 
his funeral home is next to the diner painted brown and yellow 
to match but the location is purely coincidental unlike the 
funeral business youngs diner brought customers back before it 
closed a few years ago 
we had great food some of my customers were seven days a 
week some would have breakfast and their evening meals there 
too he said 
young wants to use the land occupied by the diner to expand the 
funeral home and has been trying to sell the allsteel building for 
two years when no buyers nibbled he decided to give it away and 
placed newspaper ads that offered it free for the moving 
so far the response has been pretty dead because no one has 
been willing to pay the several thousand dollars necessary to have 
the diner dismantled and moved young said 
when they find out what it will cost to move it they dont 
seem to want to go any further he said 
the diner is the allamerican variety a jerry omahoney inc 
special from elizabeth nj with curvaceous lines stainless 
steel trim vinylcovered stools and formica counters it arrived 
in butler on two flatbed trucks in the early 1940s and had several 
owners until young bought it seven years ago 
the pie was homemade the burgers thick and the cereal came in 
little boxes 
but now all thats left is the building young sold the 
refrigerators and countertops to a pizza restaurant in illinois 
the pizza oven to a pennsylvania campground and the stoves grill 
and cash register to a youngstown ohio restaurant 
nobody would come in and take the whole place he said 
then it got to be that i just started stripping things apart 
stale cake donuts paper doilies and a babys yellow rattle 
litter the dirty floor and the walls in the kitchen area are 
coated with decades of grease 
but young says theres still plenty of life in the diner which 
with its concrete floor and industrialstrength walls seems built 
to last 
theres stainless inside good stainless he said picking 
through the rubble to reveal an old menu paint that steel and 
polish the stainless and you have a pretty good looking building 
but more than anything it was an institution in this bustling 
western pennsylvania city of about 17000 as a teenager young 
remembers well the lines that formed outside 
people waited to get in it was a very busy diner he said 
when young ran the diner it featured such culinary specialties 
as the digger special a hamburger topped with a fried egg and 
sauteed mushrooms his favorite 
speaking of his decision to give the diner away he said id 
like to see it used someplace and id go past and say that used 
to be mine

the best place to discover old movies isnt 
on the late late show anymore its on cbs this morning 
every thursday on the cbs program director peter bogdanovich 
praises classic films available on videocassette through the 
fiveminute pieces cbs this morning viewers have been 
presented with the works of george cukor howard hawks and preston 
sturges 
tom cruise and eddie murphy so far have been left alone 
i dont think a film is an old film just because it was made 
many years ago bogdanovich said 
if its a good picture its still new for those people who 
havent seen it before there are so many films that i wish i could 
be seeing again for the first time part of the impetus for 
doing this is the need for another small voice out there helping 
people enjoy themselves and see something good 
the director of the last picture show paper moon and 
mask bogdanovich has spent much of his career discussing film 
history 
ive always been interested in the tradition of hollywood and 
the past ive always written about all the directors and that was 
something i was interested in before i ever started directing 
as bogdanovich looks at it todays filmgoers have been blanched 
by a stream of mediocre movies and empty television shows 
furthermore films from hollywoods golden era now are considered 
oldfashioned and therefore avoided 
i think this whole generation people in their teens and 
early 20s doesnt know about old movies at all bogdanovich 
said kids dont like things that their parents like so asking 
somebody to watch a black and white movie is as though were asking 
them to listen to glenn miller or something 
given the choice between ernst lubitschs 1942 film to be or 
not to be and alan johnsons 1982 remake which one will most 
video shoppers choose the new one because its in color and 
stars mel brooks bogdanovich said nobody knows who carole 
lombard and jack benny are 
when a movie is seen on a television screen not in the 
theaters the films impact is reduced bogdanovich said there 
is a tremendous difference between seeing a movie on video and 
seeing it on a big screen but i guess its better to see a 
reproduction of a painting in a book than to never see the painting 
at all 
what i have been trying to do is convey to the consumer when 
he walks into a video store and is confronted by all these titles 
how do i know what to get its tough to know if you see a shelf 
of john wayne pictures theres rio grande and the searchers 
and tall in the saddle so how do you know if tall in the 
saddle is as good as the others 
bogdanovich finds that television has certain advantages over 
magazine columns his usual forum for film criticism 
at some point early on it struck me that while five minutes 
on television isnt much five minutes in a movie is a long time 
so ive been approaching these as fiveminute movies i try to use 
the visual the video clips and the audio as two separate 
things the visual gives you information that i am not repeating in 
the audio so you are getting twice as much information as you 
normally get 
bogdanovich does not devote each cbs this morning segment to 
one director he has also looked at political films screwball 
comedies oscar losers and mgm musicals 
two contemporary directors elaine may and john cassavetes 
have been profiled 
which is not to say though that bogdanovich is swept away with 
the contemporary cinema he said there is no question that its 
far inferior than movies of the 40s and 50s 
im not saying there are not some good picture makers 
around bogdanovich said but since the early 60s the 
golden age of american film has ended as i see it 
if as bogdanovich hopes he returns to feature film production 
he may no longer have time for his cbs this morning series 
bogdanovich said he plans to direct texasville larry 
mcmurtrys sequel to the last picture show next spring with a 
cast that includes cybill shepherd jeff bridges cloris leachman 
and eileen brennan 
until then hell look to the past

bernie grant was branded a public enemy three 
years ago for defending black youths involved in a north london 
riot in which a policeman was hacked to death 
today far from being hounded out of public life 44yearold 
grant is a member of parliament and perhaps the most influential 
black politician in britain 
when grant diane abbott and paul boateng won seats for the 
opposition labor party in the june 1987 election to become the 
first blacks ever to enter the house of commons many hailed it as 
a breakthrough for britains 24 million blacks 
those who feared that grants flamboyant radicalism would prove 
disruptive have been confounded with his greying beard 
gaptoothed smile and melodious caribbean accent grant has emerged 
as a charming conversationalist and a dedicated parliamentarian 
i suppose some people must have expected me to act in a 
certain way and they were probably surprised he said in an 
interview but i havent adjusted my approach to politics in any 
way 
that approach holds that the 4percent black minority are at 
the bottom of the pile and becoming a powder keg in the inner 
cities 
i wouldnt be surprised if there were another disturbance 
tomorrow he said its there and its going to happen because 
the government isnt paying any attention to it 
weve got our backs to the wall and were fighting against a 
very racist government that discriminates against black people 
the problem i think black people are facing now isnt the 
overt racism that to a large extent happened in the 60s but 
its the unconscious racism the racism of the people that make 
policy that will affect a large amount of black people adversely 
grant emigrated from his native guyana a former british colony 
on south americas northeast coast to britain in 1963 here he 
became the first black ever to head a municipal council leading 
the north london borough of haringey for three years 
he burst into national prominence in 1985 when an impoverished 
housing project in the tottenham area of haringey erupted in riots 
and the policeman was hacked to death the first ever to die in 
british racerelated unrest 
grant accused the predominantly white police force of sparking 
the violence and in his most controversial utterance said the 
blacks felt they had given the police a bloody good hiding 
thrashing 
he insisted he was not seeking to justify the killing but simply 
explaining how other blacks felt about it 
the effect was incendiary 
the rightwing tabloid press called him barmy bernie home 
secretary douglas hurd branded him a high priest of race 
conflict and nearly 1000 haringey borough workers staged a 
oneday strike demanding his resignation his white girlfriend 
councilor sharon lawrence received death threats 
ive never denied it he says now ive never regretted 
it ive never withdrawn what i said my position at the time was 
to put forward the views of the young people 
it defused the situation a lot of the newspapers turned on 
me i was quite clear in what i was doing 
in the 1987 election he carried tottenham where 37 percent of 
the electorate are black or asian with a sharply reduced labor 
majority 
in his maiden speech to parliament grant said that unless young 
blacks were offered better prospects they will find other means 
of expressing their frustration 
he claims police still harass black youths using unnecessary 
force and planting evidence 
when he first arrived in parliament grant said he underwent an 
initiation ceremony in which seven or eight legislators from the 
governing conservative party gathered around him in the smoking 
room and sort of baited me with racial innuendo 
they were deliberately trying to create an incident but it 
didnt work he said i was quite cool 
when a doorman tried to eject him from the public gallery even 
though he knew who i was grant threatened to withdraw from the 
daily business of parliament until the speaker examined his 
complaint the doorman apologized 
grant has confronted parliament with issues ranging from alleged 
harassment of blacks in the armed forces to prime minister margaret 
thatchers handsoff policy toward south africa 
but he said he has problems with the labor party too 
he charges that its hierarchical system keeps black politicians 
out of the limelight and ignores his expertise in local government 
and race relations 
nonetheless grant said im quite happy despite all the 
faults of the place parliament to be there its relatively easy 
compared to the pressure i was under when i was leader of haringey 
council to some extent the spotlight has been dimmed

with the stock market going nowhere the 
investment newsletter business is going under at least for awhile 
purveyors of tip sheets investor hotlines and 
marketintelligence reports have suffered sharp declines in new 
subscriptions in the months since the october crash 
several have put their businesses up for sale and others have 
stopped publishing because of cancellations and trouble in finding 
new customers especially given the markets apathetic performance 
lately 
to be sure some wellknown newsletters are doing quite well 
especially those that warned subscribers to reduce their stock 
exposure prior to the crash a few have even enjoyed increased 
circulation but the majority are suffering acutely 
individual investors just arent interested said dianne 
chaykin marketing director for investment information services a 
chicagobased concern that publishes four newsletters she said 
postcrash response rates to directmail solicitations have fallen 
by at least 50 percent 
you ask anybody and theyll say renewal rates are the best in 
the industry but you can only live on your renewals for so long 
she said 
this is not just the summer heat affecting the subscriptions 
this is a bear market the name of the game right now is to survive 
this period 
the number of letters is estimated at between 600 and 1000 but 
that appears to be dropping diversified investors forecast closed 
in july for example investment information services itself 
recently acquired a californiabased mutualfund advisory service 
ms chaykin said 
stan weinstein publisher of the highly successful professional 
tape reader in hollywood fla has predicted that a year from now 
you are going to see far fewer newsletters 
to a great extent the large number of newsletters that were 
created over the past few years directly resulted from the historic 
bull market that began in 1982 and ended with frightening finality 
last october 
many relied on directmail solicitations to thousands of small 
investors eager to participate in what was promoted as an 
unprecedented opportunity to profit in stocks the newsletters did 
not take much startup money either 
in a bull market anybody with a personal computer and a 
stockbroker could start a newsletter ms chaykin said if its 
just you and a secretary you dont need many subscriptions at a 
100 dollars a pop 
in that type of environment garnering customers by mail is 
considered the best way to increase circulation but as a 
postcrash strategy it is excessively expensive because few people 
respond 
during most of the time it certainly has paid to do direct 
mailing to attract trial subscription but there have been periods 
like now when it becomes inefficient to do so and you hold off 
said arnold kaufman editor of the outlook a newsletter published 
by standard amp poors corp in new york 
although the 240ayear letter is in no danger kaufman 
expressed concern about prospects for increasing subscriptions a 
direct consequence of when individual investors will find stocks 
alluring again 
were in a somewhat unique situation here we went through the 
largest market decline since the depression we just dont know how 
this is going to work out he said 
there have been other bad times for newsletters mark hulbert 
head of hulbert financial digest a washingtonbased publication 
that tracks the performance of about 150 newsletters said the last 
downturn was in 1984 before it was clear that wall street was in 
the midst of a major advance 
a particularly bad period for the newsletter business came in 
1974 another hard year for stocks hulbert said 
the irony is that when the markets going up everybodys 
making money and they need a newsletter a lot less he said if 
you look at it coolly and rationally you need a good newsletter 
more in a bear market than in a bull market 
that certainly has been the case for weinstein who correctly 
predicted the october break and says he has enjoyed a vast increase 
in subscriptions for his 275ayear newsletter 
another beneficiary has been charles m laloggia publisher of 
special situation report a rochester ny triweekly that focuses 
on takeover stocks one of the few profitable areas in the 
postcrash market 
laloggia said he had a sharp dropoff in subscriptions to his 
230ayear newsletter immediately after october but regained them 
partly because of his prescience in picking acquisition targets 
a lot of of people thought the takeover game was dead but i 
stuck my neck out and said it wasnt he said 
laloggia said his own theory on newsletters was that they worked 
like any other cyclical business quality attracts the loyal 
customers through bad times and good 
when you have a bull market you get more newsletters and more 
subscribers but when you have the inevitable shakeout the ones 
that survive are the ones that provide something of value he 
said

last month his first visit to the country of his parents in 29 
years 
the past year also has seen premieres of two bernstein 
compositions my twelve tone melody for irving berlins 100th 
birthday and jubilee games to celebrate the 50th anniversary 
of the israel philharmonic orchestra with which he has long been 
associated 
a decade ago bernsteins energy waned after the death of his 
wife chilean actress felicia montealegre and he slipped into 
months of depression but since then he has divided much of his 
time between his homes in new york and fairfield conn and 
austria where he has often appeared with the vienna philharmonic 
his life has been as dizzy a balancing act as his emotional 
style on the podium jabs contortions and leaps that have 
occasionally caused him to fall his style at the podium has been 
such a giggle that the music critic virgil thomson once said he 
shagged shimmied and believe it or not bumped 
bernstein himself has often maintained that conductors should be 
actors 
i dont mean that when the music is tragic youve got to act 
like barrymore in hamlet but you have to indicate to the 
orchestra by your body and your face which is all youve got what 
the shape of the phrase is he said if you dont use a baton 
you work harder because then your arm has to take its place 
bernstein was a wiry young man of 25 with bony face and dark 
wavy hair when he got the break that helped him become one of 
americas titans of classical music 
on nov 14 1943 he filled in at the last minute for an ailing 
bruno walter to conduct the new york philharmonic on a national 
radio broadcast the triumph of the orchestras newly appointed 
assistant conductor was big enough to join the world war ii 
headlines on the front page of the new york times 
i had no sleep no rehearsal a splitting headache 
bernstein recalled in a recent interview with life i walked on 
with an awful hangover and dont remember another thing until i 
heard a thunderous ovation 
bernstein has juggled careers as a composer and conductor his 
compositions range from the theatrical on the town west 
side story to chamber music 
in his compositions as well as his highly acclaimed televised 
series of young peoples concerts he skimmed the cream from 
classical music and pasteurized it for the american palate 
they write letters to me from the desert from montana from 
hundreds of miles off bernstein once said in an interview with 
the associated press theyve begun to enjoy music they arent 
scared of it any more they thought it was too much for them and 
ive helped convince them it isnt 
while bernsteins musical fame grew his celebrity blossomed 
media attention really focused when he threw became known as that 
party at lennys his starstudded fundraiser for the black 
panthers which was savaged by tom wolfe as radical chic 
yet he has been shrewd in marketing his career setting up 
amberson enterprises in 1969 to manage films tv specials and 
videocasettes of his performances 
born in lawrence mass to a middleclass russianjewish 
family bernstein got a late start in music he was 10 when his 
aunt clara gave the family an upright piano but he always had an 
ear for music recalled his mother jennie in bernstein a 
biography by joan peyser 
when he was 4 or 5 he would play an imaginary piano on his 
windowsill mrs bernstein said in the book when we finally 
got a piano he did what he now says he did made love to it all 
the time 
his father sam however hoped young lenny would join his 
beauty supply business bernstein persisted with piano lessons he 
went on to study under walter piston at harvard university and 
under fritz reiner at the curtis institute

during his harvard days he met conductor dimitri mitropoulis 
who recognized his genius and encouraged him to pursue conducting 
he also met aaron copland at a 1937 concert later that night at a 
party for coplands 37th birthday bernstein impressed the composer 
with an impromptu performance without the sheet music of his 
difficult piano variations 
with coplands help bernstein whose greatest works were for 
the stage pursued classical composition he had written 
jeremiah the first of his three symphonies before artur 
rodzinski appointed him his assistant at the philharmonic in 1943 
koussevitzky the boston symphonys influential music director 
and founder of tanglewood advised his student to pursue classical 
music but bernstein continued with popular music 
the year of his philharmonic appointment he wrote the ballet 
fancy free which was a success the plot about three sailors 
24hour shore leave in new york was adapted for broadways on 
the town winning five tony awards 
soon to come were his chamber opera trouble in tahiti the 
movie score for on the waterfront broadways wonderful 
town and candide and the immortal west side story the 
romeoandjuliet tale set amid the fire escapes and street gangs of 
manhattan in the late 1950s 
bernsteins successful substitution for walter also put him in 
great demand as a conductor he left the philharmonic to be guest 
conductor at major orchestras performing in the united states and 
abroad in 1953 he became the first american to conduct at milans 
famed la scala opera house leading diva maria callas in 
cherubinis opera medea 
in 1957 the year he completed west side story bernstein 
joined mitropoulis as codirector of the new york philharmonic and 
the following year became the orchestras first americanborn 
director 
during his 11year tenure bernstein led the orchestra on tours 
of south america europe and asia and on numerous national 
television appearances in which he explained classical music to 
americans young and old his tv appearances which included the 
young peoples concerts won 11 emmy awards 
bernstein has had his critics who over the years called him 
overrated as a composer and thrashed his ballet style on the podium 
bernstein rose vertically a la nijinsky and hovered there a 
good 15 seconds the new york times critic harold schonberg once 
wrote 
but later on the occasion of bernsteins 1000th performance 
with the philharmonic on dec 15 1971 schonberg wrote at this 
time it is only right to put reservations aside and salute 
bernstein for what he did and even for what he tried to do 
bernstein was a figure that no conductor in history has matched 
among those scheduled to participate at this weeks concerts 
with the boston symphony orchestra are his son alexander 33 a 
teacher and daughter nina a 26yearold actress he also has 
another daughter jaime thomas 36 a rock musician and the mother 
of bernsteins only grandchild 
others include conductors seiji ozawa john williams michael 
tilson thomas and lauren bacall phyllis newman betty comden 
adolph green van cliburn yoyo ma elizabeth taylor publisher 
malcolm forbes and beverly sills who will be host tickets were 
selling for up to 5000 
despite the ado bernstein dreads facing his eighth decade 
everybody is much more excited about this 70th birthday 
business than i am he told the miami herald in june id like 
to ignore it 
in fact that number is just not in my vocabulary i hate 
those pictures of myself with wrinkles white hair and glasses i 
look like the little old winemaker

it has been a quartercentury now since a 
34yearold martin luther king jr stepped to a microphone at the 
lincoln memorial the final speaker in a long hot afternoon 
fourteen minutes later the minister from atlanta was the 
unquestioned king of a movement a movement that changed america 
forever and his i have a dream speech entered the history 
books 
it was no surprise that king could deliver a rousing sermon or a 
speech at least no surprise to anyone who had heard him before 
and it was no accident that he was the last of 10 speakers on 
aug 28 1963 closing the show as it were at the mammoth rally 
culminating the march on washington for civil rights 
king introduced by labor leader a philip randolph as the 
moral leader of the nation had been well known ever since 
leading a bus boycott by blacks in segregated montgomery ala in 
1955 
on that wednesday afternoon 200000 people more than any in 
the movement had dared hope for watched at the memorial millions 
more watched on television 
excited aware of just what it all meant king delivered a 
speech for the ages making up the best parts as he went along 
it will be a long time james reston wrote the next day in 
the new york times before washington forgets the melodious and 
melancholy voice of the rev dr martin luther king jr crying out 
his dreams to the multitude i have a dream he cried again 
and again 
thats how it has come to be known the dream speech 
i have a dream king sang i have a dream that one day 
this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its 
creed we hold these truths to be selfevident that all men are 
created equal 
it was just about everyone seemed to agree the greatest part 
of a great american oration 
and it wasnt in the script 
it was something he had done in detroit a couple of weeks 
before recalled andrew young now atlantas mayor then kings 
special assistant it was spontaneous in detroit and then he 
refined it in washington it didnt get any publicity in detroit 
king obviously liked the theme thought it worked well thought 
it said something but on that wednesday afternoon there was not 
to be time to say everything he wanted to say each of the 10 
speakers was limited to eight minutes 
theres no way in the world martin that you can say what 
needs to be said in eight minutes aide walter fauntroy told him 
the day before as quoted by king biographer stephen b oates 
they cant limit you the spokesman of the movement to that 
said fauntroy now the congressional delegate representing the 
nations capital 
but theyll all be mad at me if i speak longer king worried 
everybody was putting pressure on everybody to be brief 
young recalled in an interview last week he was trying to cut 
down his speech 
the night before king young and other movement leaders 
gathered at washingtons willard hotel they exchanged suggestions 
for the speech with king writing it his secretary typing it and 
retyping it and king scribbling still more changes in the margins 
he stayed up all night young said youd look in the 
margin and see as many as four or five different words in one 
place where hed crossed it out selected another one he was much 
more particular about the language than hed ever been before 
what young remembers most from that allnight labor of language 
is a theme that came early in the speech contrasting abraham 
lincolns emancipation of the black man with the black mans place 
in 1963 america 
in a sense king wrote weve come here to our nations 
capital to cash a check a promissory note a promise that 
all men yes black men as well as white men would be guaranteed 
the unalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness 
america has given the negro people a bad check a check which 
has come back marked insufficient funds but we refuse to believe 
that the bank of justice is bankrupt 
on that wednesday king sailed through his speech through the 
badcheck analogy sticking to his text but as tens of thousands 
clapped and cheered as his closest aides encouraged him all 
right tell it he suddenly decided to keep going 
he remembered what he had said in detroit and his eightminute 
speech became 14 
i say to you today my friends so even though we face the 
difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream he 
said it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream 
all of that i had a dream stuff was straight from the 
heart young said he was passionately involved in the speech 
almost immediately the speech was acclaimed as a milestone in 
the history of a man a nation and a people 
it may have been historic atlanta constitution editor 
eugene patterson wrote two days later it may be that this will 
be marked down as the date when the civil rights movement grew up 
it would have been just a large turnout of people who came and 
heard predictable things if martin luther king had not gotten 
carried away by the roars of an electrified crowd 
it still electrifies mpi home video of chicago which sells the 
speech on videotape for 1495 reports that its one of the 
companys best sellers with 10000 sold so far and sales still 
going strong 
memories of the day will be rekindled on saturday in a march on 
washington marking the 25 years since the original rally 
but those closest to king knew back then the power of his words 
we figured we heard that every time he spoke young said 
there was nothing new about his oratory 
according to some he even got better still young picks kings 
1967 speeches against the vietnam war as his finest 
he was at his best young said when he just let it go 
the speeches he gave almost totally from the heart were better 
than the speeches he prepared or the ones other people tried to 
prepare for him young said 
they were just things he felt real deeply thought through 
very deeply there was a natural eloquence about him he would be 
eloquent in conversation just go up on these flights of oratory

here are excerpts from the speech delivered by martin luther 
king jr on aug 28 1963 in washington dc 
i say to you today my friends so even though we face the 
difficulties of today and tomorrow i still have a dream it is a 
dream deeply rooted in the american dream 
i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live 
out the true meaning of its creed we hold these truths to be 
selfevident that all men are created equal 
i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia the sons 
of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able 
to sit down together at the table of brotherhood i have a dream 
that one day even the state of mississippi a state sweltering with 
the heat of injustice sweltering with the heat of oppression will 
be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice 
i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in 
a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character 
i have a dream today 
i have a dream that one day down in alabama with its vicious 
racists with its governor having his lips dripping with the words 
of interposition and nullification one day right there in alabama 
little black boys and little black girls will be able to join hands 
with little white boys and little white girls as sisters and 
brothers 
so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of new 
hampshire let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york 
let freedom ring from the heights of the alleghenies of 
pennsylvania let freedom ring from the snowcapped rockies of 
colorado let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of 
california but not only that let freedom ring from lookout 
mountain of tennessee let freedom ring from every hill and 
molehill in mississippi from every mountainside let freedom ring 
and when this happens when we allow freedom to ring when we 
let it ring from every village and every hamlet from every state 
and every city we will be able to speed up that day when all of 
gods children black men and white men jews and gentiles 
protestants and catholics will be able to join hands and sing in 
the words of the old negro spiritual 
free at last free at last thank god almighty we are free at 
last

an industrial boom is leaving an environmental 
mess in many parts of asia burgeoning populations in some 
countries make matters even worse 
a few governments are taking steps to halt the fouling of air 
and water but others are doing little sacrificing the environment 
for economic development 
there is a realization among all these countries that theyve 
got problems said bob keen principal of the center for 
environmental studies at hong kong polytechnic 
but he added whether that realization translates into action 
depends on several local factors including financial resources and 
political will 
the pollution problem is apparent in the region 
in hong kong which means fragrant harbor in chinese the 
stench from some of the local watercourses and harbors polluted 
by industrial agricultural and human waste is at times 
unbearable 
the government has closed five beaches because of poor water 
quality and estimates that 45000 people suffered infections and 
other illnesses last year by swimming at a popular beach on hong 
kong islands fashionable south side the beach remains open 
in taiwan the government environment protection administration 
rates seven of 21 main rivers as seriously polluted and describes 
the air of the islands two major cities trafficchoked taipei 
and kaohsiung as unhealthful 
a survey of 58900 miles of rivers in mainland china found 20 
percent polluted and 3100 miles seriously contaminated the 
government also found severe air pollution in 60 chinese cities 
south korea site of the summer olympics in september is 
seeing some pollution spinoff from rapid industrial development 
but the problem is being recognized a 470million fiveyear 
government effort to clean up seouls han river apparently has 
succeeded but about 100 farmers recently demonstrated at a zinc 
plant in onsan outside seoul claiming their crops were being 
damaged by sulfurous acid 
keen explained that pollution control often does not receive 
proper attention in the early days of a nations economic 
development 
but as natural history develops a critical point is reached 
where local residents say look enough were not starving any 
longer we wont stand for this rubbish 
japan was one of the first countries to reach that point as it 
led the region in rapid industrialization after people began dying 
from toxic waste that polluted lakes rivers and the air the 
government decided to take action 
a decade later japan is regaining some control of its 
environment although serious problems remain 
pollution concerns appear to have moved to the forefront in the 
new generation of asian economic miracles that includes hong kong 
and taiwan 
hong kongs englishlanguage south china morning post said in a 
june editorial unless urgent action is taken it may be too late 
to avoid leaving an appalling legacy to future generations already 
victoria harbor such a spectacular feature of hong kongs tourist 
image is one of the worlds filthiest stretches of water 
stuart reed head of the british colonys environmental 
protection department acknowledged that it wasnt until about 
three years ago that the resolve of government began to back the 
work we were doing 
since taiwan authorities relaxed martial law last year and 
allowed demonstrations local residents frequently have taken to 
the streets to protest the island nations deteriorating 
environment 
the government budgeted the taiwandollar equivalent of 171 
million for the environment protection administration this year 
more than double the 1987 figure 
in lessdeveloped nations such as thailand and the philippines 
environmental protection is not a major political issue and is 
given a low priority 
it is still not clear how much success cleanup efforts will 
achieve 
corporations unenthusiastic about expensive environmental 
control measures continue to wield plenty of political influence 
the government is weak and companies are strong tokue 
shibata former director of japans institute of environmental 
control said in a recent interview voicing sentiments shared by 
hong kongs environmentalists 
it is very difficult to prove a cause and effect with the 
new types of pollution shibata said the government says it is 
on business side unless scientists have direct proof we cant 
prove it because it takes 10 to 20 years to show up 
in hong kong conservationists note that some antipollution 
regulations have been watered down because of pressure from 
industry while others have not been rigorously enforced 
its not any good just having the legislation said ij 
hodgkiss of the the university of hong kongs department of botany 
you have to go in there and do something about it

hong kong the environmental protection departments stuart 
reed says the colonys main environmental problem is too many 
people in too small a space 57 million people living in an 
area about the size of boston population 570917 an estimated 
95 percent of all dyeing and bleaching factories have illegal 
sewage connections 
the government has started to take action with initiatives that 
include legislation to cut agricultural waste and noise pollution

taiwan nearly 20 million people clog the 13885squaremile 
island twice the size of hawaii population 106 million they

the environment protection administration head eugene chien 
maintains that taiwans economic growth which reached a robust 11 
percent annual pace in 1987 was achieved at the expense of our 
environment 
but the public and government are beginning to react 
about 1000 people marched through taipei in june to protest a 
proposed oil refining plant for their village of taoyuan 
the government is undertaking six longterm projects to improve 
the environment one is 1 billion eightyear effort to clean up

south korea the host country of the summer olympics has 
industrialzed rapidly in recent years but has also paid an 
environmental price one of the worst problems was industrial waste 
and sewage that polluted the han river which through seoul the 
capital 
the government put up 470 million in a fiveyear project 
beginning in 1982 to clean the river and fish and birds are 
returning the government recently ordered about 100 industrial 
plants and other facilities around seoul to close down suspend 
operations or take pollutioncontrol measures for not meeting 
environmental standards 
still south korean officials claim the country has no serious 
pollution problems and say industrial plants are taking required 
measures to control pollution through waste disposal treatment

china economic development has been the prime concern of deng 
xiaopings leadership with the focus on increasing production 
instead of reducing pollution but the official media recently have 
placed more emphasis on pollution problems air pollution is as bad 
as that suffered by developed countrys in the 1950s and 1960s 
according to state environmental protection bureau chief qu geping 
chinas environmental protection engineering characterized by 
outdated equipment and poor emmission control lags behind 
industrial construction development he wrote in the china 
environmental journal and this has made the countrys pollution 
levels go from bad to worse

dollarselling by central banks helped pushed the us currency

analysts said the dollars fall thursday was limited by a strong 
residue of bullish sentiment toward the dollar resulting from

german marks twice in late trading thursday in new york when the 
market was thin and more vulnerable to the action european banks 
had sold dollars earlier in the day

better off if the dollar were trading at 18 west german marks it 
is trading around 19 marks

rose contracts for september delivery of wholesale heating oil 
rose 022 cent to finish at 4415 cents a gallon september 
unleaded gasoline rose 066 cent to 4728 cents a gallon 
analysts attributed most of the rise in the september contract 
to lastminute positioning by investors in advance of the closeout 
of the contract on monday 
there is little news to spur the market said richard kane 
a trader with merrill lynch energy futures people are 
positioning themselves on the september contract and waiting for 
further direction 
traders also were influenced by reports that crude inventories 
on the coast of the gulf of mexico had declined by 6 million a 
week analysts said 
its important for the crude market kane said prices 
firmed off of that 
traders also were watching the gasoline market in anticipation 
of some tightening of supplies in the near future analysts said

whirlpool corps plan to acquire a majority 
stake in the appliance division of dutch electronics giant nv 
philips guarantees the company the top slot among appliance makers 
around the globe 
whirlpool announced thursday it will pay philips 470 million 
for 53 percent of a joint venture company that will develop 
manufacture and market major appliances under philips brand names 
the new company will employ 14000 people from the present 
philips division and will have annual sales of about 2 billion 
boosting whirpools annual revenue to about 6 billion the 
companies said in a statement 
whirlpool a close second domestically to general electric co 
long has sought to branch out of the relatively mature 12 billion 
us appliance market the company is affiliated with appliance 
concerns in canada brazil mexico and india but not in the 
lucrative european market represented by philips 
they desperately needed a wellestablished brand which 
philips is said charles ryan a first vice president at the 
investment firm merrill lynch amp co 
philips is the worlds largest television maker and europes 
biggest electronics company 
whirlpools move mirrors deals by other manufacturing companies 
seeking to rid themselves of weaker businesses and focus on markets 
where they can be major players 
last year ge became one of the worlds top medical equipment 
concerns after swapping its consumer electronics business for 
thomson sas medical equipment operations thomson in turn 
strengthened its role in consumer electronics 
also last year philips acquired the 42 percent of north 
american philips corp it did not already own to solidify its 
strength in the television lighting radio and appliance markets 
here 
you cant be everything to everybody said gerrit jeelof 
executive vice president and vice chairman of the board of 
management of philips 
speaking at a press conference here jeelof said the whirlpool 
venture would free management resources to concentrate on philips 
core electronics businesses such as semiconductors and the coming 
generation of highdefinition television 
last year philips discussed a joint venture with whirlpool and 
britains general electric co which is unrelated to the us 
company of the same name those talks fell through because of 
uncertain economic conditions following the stock market crash and 
a weak dollar 
but they parted very friendly and this year the dollar has 
come back up relative to the dutch guilder so talks were 
reactivated merrill lynchs ryan said 
whirlpool will pay philips 350 million for a 53 percent stake 
in the joint venture and 120 million more if the venture continues 
beyond three years whirlpool has an option to acquire the 
remainder of the philips division for which it would pay 470 
million instead of the 120 million 
the new company will be based in the netherlands and will market 
washers dryers refrigerators freezers stoves microwave ovens 
and dishwashers around the world but primarily in europe 
appliances will be sold under the philips bauknecht and ignis 
brand names 
whirlpool could take advantage of philips expertise in 
convection cooking and gas cooking while the european joint 
venture could benefit from whirlpools strength in products such as 
dishwashers air conditioners and clothes dryers that are beginning 
to catch on in europe said david r whitwam whirlpools chairman 
president and chief executive officer 
whirlpool stock rose 12 cents to 2575 a share in new york 
stock exchange trading 
whirlpool based in benton harbor mich manufactures and 
markets a range of home appliances under the whirlpool kitchenaid 
and roper brand names the company which employs about 31000 
people and has annual sales of about 42 billion also is a major 
supplier to sears roebuck amp co of kenmore products 
the joint venture is the latest in a string of consolidations in 
the appliance industry 
earlier this year whirlpool engaged in a bidding war with ge 
over the appliance maker roper corp ge ultimately acquired roper 
and its manufacturing facilities but whirlpool struck a deal to 
gain the roper brand name 
other major appliance mergers in recent years include maytag 
corps acquisition of magic chef co and the acquisition of white 
consolidated industries by swedens electrolux ab 
last month philips announced its profit fell 44 percent in the 
second quarter an unexpectedly poor performance that the company 
blamed on an onslaught of competition from southeast asia and 
losses on foreign currencies 
philips hinted then that it was about to take a major step to 
raise cash such as a big joint venture or sale of a large part of 
the company 
philips whose annual sales have topped 25 billion has been 
cutting costs at its european factories and moving more production 
to lowercost areas including the united states in the past seven 
months it has laid off 6000 european employees and has promised at 
least 4000 more cuts

a federal regulator says the consolidation of 
12 insolvent texas thrifts in a single 13 billion deal signals 
the things to come in texas and elsewhere as the government tries 
to clean up the battered thrift industry 
m danny wall chairman of the federal home loan bank board 
declined on thursday to specify when the next consolidation would 
take place but he indicated about half of an estimated 200 
insolvent thrift cases currently in various states of negotiation 
bidding and marketing may be resolved by the end of the year 
earlier in the week bank board member roger martin said that by 
the end of august 35 insolvent thrifts would be dealt with under 
the socalled southwest plan to consolidate and recapitalize ailing 
thrifts in the region 
walls comments came as regulators announced the government 
would spend 13 billion to assist the acquisition of 12 failed 
thrifts by an investor group led by chicago banker william gibson 
the transaction the fourth consolidation under the southwest 
plan was the biggest single such deal to date and doubled the 
number of texas thrifts to be merged since the first transaction in 
may 
while were focusing a lot of attention on the state of texas 
because of the concentration of the problem within the industry in 
that state we continue to work elsewhere wall said 
the consolidation brings to 68 the number of mergers 
consolidations and insurance actions approved nationwide so far 
this year wall said the number was ahead of what we had 
established as a minimum goal so far this year and that ratio that 
average per week would only continue to increase as we move toward 
the end of the year 
the action accounts for 24 of the 109 texas thrifts that were 
insolvent when work on the southwest plan began earlier this year 
and we plan to complete the work in texas by the end of may 
1989 wall said 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp will provide an 
immediate 499 million note to fund the new consolidation with the 
money going to boost capital and help cover bad loans outside 
investors will inject 48 million 
gibson executive vice president of continential illinois 
national bank and trust in chicago and continental illinois corp 
will serve as president and chief executive officer of the new 
institution 
gibson is a former senior vice president at first republicbank 
corp of dallas the federal deposit insurance corp bailed out 
first republicbank in july when it pledged 4 billion to help ncnb 
corp charlotte nc take over the troubled banking giant 
the new dallasbased thrift will be called american federal bank 
fsb it has more than 50 branches in texas but it was not 
immediately known how many would be closed 
the bank board regulator of the thrift industry said the 12 
thrifts had combined assets of nearly 24 billion and liabilities 
of 3 billion 
fhlbb officials said the 12 thrifts were losing a combined 105 
million a quarter one of the merged thrifts richardson savings 
and loan association of dallas had a 776 million loss in the 
first quarter of 1988 the 10th worst earnings record nationally 
among thrifts 
two other thrifts mercury savings association wichita falls 
and ben milam savings and loan cameron were in the bank boards 
management consignment program which replaces the management of 
ailing thrifts with those from healthy ones 
the acquisition was the first involving capital from outside the 
thrift industry wall said 
todays transaction shows that private investors are willing 
to bring in hard cash for the opportunity of participating in the 
texas thrift recovery he said 
wall said the end of the federal fiscal year sept 30 and the 
end of the calendar year are helping drive the bank board forward 
a tax exemption involving fslicassisted transactions is scheduled 
to be phased out dec 31 wall said 
the thrift industry continues to lose capital although the 
decline apparently slowed down in the last quarter and officials 
have put the cost of restoring health to the industry anywhere from 
26 million to 100 million as debate continues on capitol hill 
over whether a taxpayer bailout will face the next president after 
he takes office in january 
the fhlbb reported earlier this month that the industrys 
capital declined by 172 billion in the apriljune period 
compared with a drop of 351 billion in the first quarter and 
468 billion the last three months of 1987

the 13 billion federallyassisted merger of 12 
troubled savings and loan associations demonstrates investor faith 
in texas and in the recovery of the thrift industry according to a 
dallas businessman involved in the buyout 
lone star technologies financial service corp a subsidiary of 
lone star technologies inc of dallas and an investor group headed 
by chicago banker william e gibson have agreed to pay 48 million 
for the thrifts in a deal announced thursday 
the federal savings and loan insurance corp is providing a 499 
million note immediately to restore positive net worth to the 
merged thrifts and could spend a total of 13 billion in the 
transaction 
were very enthusiastic about this innovative transaction 
because we believe it helps to solve the texas savings and loan 
problem said william howard beasley iii chairman and chief 
executive officer of lone star technologies 
it demonstrated our faith in the institutions in the future 
of texas and in the thrift industry as a whole beasley said 
lone star and the gibson group are the first investors from 
outside the savings and loan industry to participate in a buyout 
under the socalled southwest plan for aiding the regions thrift 
industry said mary a creedon deputy executive director of the 
fslic 
the thrifts were placed under receivership and combined to form 
the new institution of american federal bank fsb 
gibson an executive vice president with continental illinois 
national bank and trust co in chicago will return to dallas to 
head the newly formed institution 
he said his group had been considering investment in the texas 
industry long before formation of the southwest plan a federal 
home loan bank board program in which regulators plan to merge or 
close more than 100 of the 279 thrifts that operated in texas on 
jan 1 with thursdays transaction 24 have cases have been 
resolved in texas 
the gibson group took a look at what was going on in texas and 
what was going on in the thrift business and just felt that a new 
approach was in order gibson said 
there was an awful lot that was good about texas and about the 
thrift business but both had their problems we just felt there was 
some room for some new blood some new approaches some new 
expertise 
gibson is a former senior vice president of republicbank corp 
of dallas he and beasley have a nearly 20year friendship dating 
back to their association in washington beasley once served as a 
special assistant to secretary of the treasury and gibson served as 
a special assistant to the council of economic advisers 
gibson said he felt comfortable returning to texas despite its 
shaky economy and the shaky financial condition of the savings and 
loan industry 
were going to be making loans making loans sensibly were 
not going to make acquisition development or construction loans 
were going to have more sound business practices 
ms creedon said a large number of depositors possibly more 
than 100000 would be affected by the transaction but she said 
all deposits insured and uninsured would transfer to the newly 
formed institution

mainframe computers can write musical harmonies 
in the style of johann sebastian bach by using new software created 
by a researchercomposer at international business machines corp 
kemal ebcioglu said thursday he created the software to help 
understand bachs style more precisely and to help explore the 
frontiers of computer science 
the musical work led to the creation of a programming language 
that could be adapted for other jobs requiring heavy computation 
such as deciphering the molecular structure of genes ebcioglu said 
although other computer programs can be used to compose music 
the ibm software is the only one to duplicate the bach chorale 
styles ebcioglu said 
the program called choral adds bass tenor and alto parts to 
chorale melodies that are written for soprano it is not intended 
as a commercial product because of its limited usefulness and its 
huge appetite for computing power 
ebcioglu who holds a masters degree in music and a doctorate 
in computer science said the software uses more than 350 
compositional rules that he programmed into it based on years of 
study of bachs chorales 
a chorale harmonization of 20 bars requires about 30 minutes of 
computing time and 23 billion simple instructions on one of ibms 
giant 3090 series of mainframe computers a measure of the 
complexity of bachs music 
choral would probably receive an aboveaverage to excellent 
grade in a college composition class said ebcioglu 
it is unknown to what degree we can replicate human creativity 
by a computer but what we can do is impose much higher standards 
on computercreated music said ebcioglu 
choral builds a harmonization stage by stage it backtracks and 
changes notes that it considers to be responsible for a deadend 
when the deadend is encountered in that way it resembles an 
animal negotiating a maze 
many kinds of scientific research involve similar searches 
ebcioglus new programming language backtracking specification 
language simplifies the search process 
bachs chorale style was relatively easy to replicate because it 
is wellunderstood ebcioglu said he said other natural candidates 
for expert systems programs would be antonio vivaldi and franz 
joseph haydn 
compositional rules by themselves cannot produce beautiful 
music ebcioglu said composers use additional knowledge talent 
for choosing among the many theoretically possible extensions of a 
particular composition 
ebcioglu said he came up with a good approximation of talent by 
building a large number of precise guidelines based on an 
understanding of bachs style 
ebcioglu works at ibms thomas j watson research center in 
yorktown heights ny

a state judge who struck down new jerseys 
39yearold law banning selfservice gas stations has given state 
lawmakers six months to enact regulations complying with his 
decision 
superior court judge martin l haines of mount holly ruled the 
safety considerations that originally prompted passage of the law 
in 1949 no longer were valid and that the law violated the state 
constitutions limits on the legislatures police power 
in doing so the judge went against a 1952 state supreme court 
ruling upholding the law but he contended the facts of the issue 
had changed since then thus allowing him to break with precedent 
the testimony before me revealed very different facts 
selfservice stations are at least as safe as fullservice 
stations haines said thursday in a telephone interview 
selfservice station proponents praised the decision made 
public thursday but issued to attorneys on wednesday 
we see it as a victory for consumer freedom of choice said 
john f holtz associate director of the new jersey petroleum 
council which represents the states largest oil companies 
but jerry ferrara executive director of the new jersey gasoline 
retailers association and allied trades inc which represents 
about 3000 new jersey service stations said he was disappointed 
ferrara said legalizing selfservice would not bring any cost 
benefits to motorists would prompt gasoline stations to lay off 
workers and would turn many service stations into gasonly 
stations closing their repair shops 
new jersey and oregon are the only two states that still 
prohibit selfservice stations 
haines ruling came in a lawsuit filed by kirschner brothers oil 
co inc of haverford pa against the state department of labor 
the company which owns about 20 service stations in new jersey 
claimed the law was antiquated and that customers should have a 
choice between self and fullservice 
proponents of selfservice also say it could help drive down 
costs at the pump by decreasing labor expenses 
proposals to legalize selfservice pumps are pending before the 
law and public safety committees in both the senate and assembly 
the law was enacted by legislators who expressed concern that 
motorists were endangered by pumping their own gas opponents of 
selfservice stations still back their arguments with newspaper 
reports of fires and other accidents that have injured or killed 
motorists who were trying to pump their own gas 
opponents also say the change would increase profits of gasoline 
companies the labor department has lobbied against changing the 
law 
the state supreme court affirmed the statute in 1952 haines 
ruled june 29 that he could not overturn a law affirmed by a higher 
court but reconsidered when asked by kirschner 
haines decided safety no longer was an issue allowing him to 
reverse his earlier ruling and break with precedent 
the state attorney generals office which represented the labor 
department has not decided whether to appeal the decision said 
spokeswoman becky taylor

school cafeteria workers got results after 
complaining about a roy rogers commercial that depicted them 
foisting unpleasantlooking food on students with a warning that 
school was imminent 
the bethesda mdbased marriott corp which owns the chain of 
stores purveying roast beef sandwiches fried chicken and 
hamburgers said thursday it would pull the tv ad 
but it maintained that the spot was misunderstood it was 
supposed to be a spoof of the way school cafeterias were years ago 
marriott has over 65000 employees that work in cafeterias 
and the last thing were going to do is try and offend somebody 
said marriott spokesman rick sneed 
charles hughes president of local 372 of the state county and 
municipal workers aflcio which represents more than 8000 school 
cafeteria workers had called the commercial despicable 
i think theyve stooped to a new low by advocating that 
children ought to eat junk food on a daily basis hughes said 
the commercial starts with the tune see you in september 
and shows a series of cafeteria workers holding trays of 
unappealing food close to the camera an announcer intones that 
students have only a few weeks left to eat at roy rogers before the 
fall term begins 
the ad very clearly sends a message that one of the things you 
ought to be dreading as labor day approaches is a return to the 
school cafeteria said city councilwoman ruth messinger 
the ad began airing about 10 days ago and was to run until sept 
9 but sneed said its our intent to pull it as soon as we can 
it will not run its full course 
he said the company got calls from food service managers 
complaining that thats not the way cafeteria workers look now 
and its also not the type of food served now macaroni and 
cheese sandwiches and so forth

a cartoonist for the ohio republican party 
was fired after disclosure that some of his cartoons closely 
resembled pulitzer prizewinning cartoonist jeff macnellys work 
ed wilson the cartoonist was dismissed after a meeting by 
state gop officials who attended the republican national convention 
in new orleans he was hired six weeks ago to draw cartoons 
lampooning democrats 
mr wilson has been dismissed and an appropriate apology will 
be forthcoming to jeff macnelly and his syndicate ohio 
republican chairman robert bennett said thursday night 
the dayton daily news reported thursday that several of wilsons 
cartoons are strikingly similar to those drawn by macnelly who 
works for the chicago tribune 
in his subsequent statement bennett said it is clear that 
some of mr wilsons drawings are too similar to drawings by 
another artist 
dave garick the state partys communications director said 
ohio gop officials were disappointed over the incident because they 
thought wilson had a promising career 
neither wilson nor macnelly immediately responded to the firing 
wilson had said earlier that the similarities are coincidental 
macnelly had said he was considering turning the matter over to an 
attorney 
the daily news reported that four cartoons drawn by wilson for 
the ohio gop are virtually the same as the macnelly drawings 
except that the political figures have been changed to reflect 
current politics in two others the artwork is strikingly similar 
but the subject matter is different the newspaper said 
one of macnellys cartoons shows president jimmy carter standing 
in a trash can while he speaks at a podium an adviser is saying 
no no no stand on your record not in it now youve got it all 
over your suit 
wilsons cartoon features massachusetts gov michael dukakis 
the democratic presidential nominee also standing in a trash can 
behind a podium a voice from the auditorium is saying no no 
no stand on your record not in it 
macnelly has won three pulitzer prizes for editorial cartooning 
his cartoons are syndicated by the tribune syndicate co and were 
published in his 1984 book directions he also draws the 
syndicated comic strip shoe 
in the time he worked for the ohio gop wilson drew about 30 
cartoons that were attached to news releases and on at least two 
occasions handed out to the public 
the similarities were found by daily news staff artist randy 
palmer who saw some of wilsons cartoons last weekend and compared 
them with panels he saw in macnellys book the newspaper said

male members of the san francisco press 
club are defying a judges order to give female members the same 
access to an indoor pool by continuing to swim in the nude 
before the ruling a month ago the press club allowed men to use 
the pool daily from 7 am to 9 pm but women were limited to two 
hours on thursday and four on sunday about 180 of the clubs 1800 
members are women 
a female club member filed a discrimination suit against the 
club prompting superior court judge maxine chesney to order it to 
immediately end its practice of restricting the hours female 
members could use the pool and locker room 
despite her victory in court irene vacchina a press club 
member since 1979 said locker room attendants still tell her she 
cant go in when the men are there 
i feel cheated and hurt by the club it is illegal for them to 
take my money and then give me unequal treatment she said dues 
are 780 a year 
the clubs acting manager joyce cirimelli said she has posted 
a copy of the judges ruling in the pool area and a notice saying 
that members who want to swim must wear bathing suits but many men 
are still swimming in the buff 
the men act like its their kingdom down there she said 
vacchinas lawyer kathy mount said the club could have avoided 
the problem if it had chosen a different way to comply with the 
order instead of opening the pool to both sexes the club could 
have let women and men use the pool the same number of hours but on 
different days 
press club members who disobey the ruling can be found in 
contempt of court and fined or jailed mount said

oil prices are expected to remain at their present 
low levels through the early 1990s according to a study published 
friday by analysts of business international a genevabased 
consulting firm 
oil prices will start to recover when members of the 
organization of petroleum exporting countries especially the 
middle east producers recover some of the world market share that 
they began losing to nonopec members in the early 1980s the study 
said 
opecs output will increase to 214 million barrels a day in 
1992 from an estimated 184 million this year the study said 
the current selfimposed ceiling on the output of 12 of the opec 
members is 1506 million barrels a day although the countries have 
been exceeding their quotas iraq the 13th member has refused to 
join in the quota sharing program since 1986 
oil prices will remain at their current weak levels a 
summary of the study said this will undermine revenues and 
increased indebtedness in parts of the region 
in spite of weak oil prices the annual economic growth of the 
six major economies in the region saudi arabia egypt algeria 
iran iraq turkey was predicted to average 27 percent during 
19881992 as compared with 05 percent during the five preceding 
years 
the study warned western companies doing business in the middle 
east to brace for tough conditions in the next few years but said 
it expected a recovery after 1990 
market conditions will become increasingly favorable to 
initiatives by foreign investors and the private sector it 
added in all the countries liberalization policies will open 
new avenues for local and foreign investors 
the study said that no solutions were expected for the longterm 
regional political conflicts even a formal ceasefire in the gulf 
war is not expected to reduce the level of militarization of the 
iraniraq border or of the gulf as a whole it added

into metro national bank of denver to meet minimum federal 
standards and to prevent the banks failure 
with this additional capital the bank will continue serving 
its depositors and at the same time have the opportunity to 
develop a longterm program responsive to the needs of the denver 
business community davis said in a prepared statement after 
transferring the money on thursday 
davis the primary owner of the 77 million bank in denvers 
17th street financial district made the contribution to metros 
capital just after the federal deposit insurance corp held an 
auction for the bank in which the fdic tried to find a buyer for 
the bank

ratio to 7 percent the minimum required by regulations and 
boosted davis contributions to metro to 32 million a spokesman 
said

bailed the bank out of problems before 
the bank has been hit hard by energy real estate and penny 
stockrelated loans it was on the brink of insolvency last month 
after the colorado supreme court refused to strike a 940000 
judgment against the bank in a case involving a defunct penny stock 
brokerage regulators said 
on march 31 metros capital had fallen to 164 percent of 
assets after the bank lost 610000 during the first three months 
of the year it lost 129 million in 1987 according to sheshunoff 
information services inc 
problem loans totaled 113 million or more than 20 percent of 
the banks total loan portfolio officials said 
the banks problems have forced officials to reduce its size by 
more than 50 percent since 1984 when it had 181 million in assets

only 77 million the 1987 tax bill on the house totaled 132000

a general motors corp unit plans to lay 
off about 550 workers at its plant here and move its spindle 
bearing operations to ohio officials of new departurehyatt 
bearings said 
when the move is completed about 500 workers will remain at the 
bearing manufacturing plant in bristol where 3500 people worked 
just 10 years ago company officals said thursday 
the gm subsidiary which recently phased out 675 jobs after 
eliminating production of commercial bearings also may sell its 
plant here and seek a smaller site mayor john j leone said 
the move to sandusky ohio was purely a business decision 
said jerome bishop director of media relatins at the components 
division he said the two plants in sandusky and bristol gave the 
company 40 percent more space than it needed to run the separate 
spindle bearing operations 
bishop said there was no guarantee the company celebrating its 
100th anniversary in bristol this year would stay in connecticut 
were in an extremely competitive worldwide market and we must 
remain competitive with all our product lines he said 
bishop said 130 of the 330 workers in the spindle bearings 
operation will be offered jobs in sandusky the other 200 workers 
will be offered a cash settlement early retirement or placed in a 
company job bank which pays workers their full salaries to remain 
available for spot duty 
new departures decision to move some operations is another blow 
to an industry beleagured both in connecticut and in the united 
states 
the international trade commission reported to congress earlier 
this month that international competition declining profits and 
decreasing investment have dangerously weakened the industry 
in connecticut the bearings industry employed 16000 people in 
the mid1960s but that number dropped to just 7600 by 1984

while attorneys considered what to do about an 
order holding off a joint operating agreement between the detroit 
news and detroit free press laidoff employees reoccupied the 
desks they had just vacated 
workers expressed confusion and resignation at the holdup of the 
agreement scheduled to take effect thursday 
some like artist annie lazurek who had been laid off wednesday 
after 22 years at the free press said they were returning to 
protect severance benefits 
what choice do i have lazurek asked 
a temporary restraining order late wednesday by us district 
judge joyce hens green halted the joint operating agreement granted 
by attorney general edwin meese iii before he left office last week 
that blocks the merger at least until a sept 8 hearing 
the detroit newspaper agency which was to begin handling the 
combined functions of the two papers thursday remained in limbo 
and executives scrambled to put back together the separate 
operations they had dismantled 
newspaper attorneys havent decided how to respond to greens 
order said william keating chief executive of the agency 
its unbelievable my desk is cleared except for one pen 
said tom szczepanski a free press account executive who would have 
reported to the same job in a different location under the joa 
robert decooman 60 had accepted early retirement and had seen 
his son laid off wednesday after 16 years with the news 
the two among an estimated 500 people at the news and free 
press whose positions would be eliminated under a joa thought they 
had left the newspaper for the last time only to be notified to 
return to work thursday 
this is terrible decooman said im so sick of this 
because the last two years of my life have been absolutely nothing 
but turmoil 
its like an emotional roller coaster said his son richard 
decooman if i refuse to come back where does that leave me 
free press general manager robert j hall said wednesday was 
one of the worst days of my life 
the employees of the free press have lived under uncertainty 
and on an emotional roller coaster for the past 28 months hall 
said and to put this on top of all that is more than most people 
should be called on to endure 
the free press owned by knightridder inc and the news owned 
by gannett co inc asked the us justice department in 1986 for 
a limited antitrust exemption to allow the joa citing substantial 
losses at both papers and saying the free press probably would fail 
without the arrangement 
opponents such as detroit mayor coleman young and unions 
representing the newspaper employees dropped their opposition after 
knightridder said earlier this year that it would close the free 
press if a joa were denied 
the new ruling came in a suit filed by a group of newspaper 
readers and advertisers called michigan citizens for an independent 
press 
where were they two and a half years ago or even six months 
ago asked lucy page a classified advertising sales 
representative at the news 
page said she had first been happy because she was to keep her 
job under the joa but then i went out and saw all the people who 
were getting moved and all and by the end of the day i just 
couldnt be happy 
bringing the new suit were state sen john kelly ddetroit w 
edward wendover publisher of the plymouthcanton community crier 
former detroit news gossip columnist matt beer a former news 
circulation employee william cowan david kersh president of 
metro publications inc and murray greenhalge a free press 
printer 
they were represented by public citizen litigation group a 
washingtonbased organization founded by ralph nader 
kelly said the group sought closer scrutiny of something that 
would have a 100year monopoly than the legal review given it by 
mr meese

polaroid corp seeking to elude a 
hostile takeover by shamrock holdings inc has raised to 1500 the 
number of employees it wants to retire voluntarily in an effort to 
consolidate resources 
company officials have also warned employees that layoffs could 
occur if the payrolltrimming goal is not met 
the threat of forced layoffs was made wednesday in a speech 
delivered to polaroids highestranking executives by chief 
executive officer i macallister booth and replayed on videotape 
thursday before hundreds of marketing employees meeting in 
cambridge 
this company is like a family to me said booth when my 
family gets attacked i fight and when my company gets attacked 
i fight too 
shamrock a california investment firm controlled by roy e 
disney made an unsolicited offer july 20 to buy polaroid shamrock 
raised its offer last friday but the offer was unanimously 
rejected tuesday by polaroids board of directors 
according to todays boston globe shamrock has indicated it is 
prepared to launch a hostile tender offer if polaroid refuses to 
negotiate 
on the heels of a previously announced restructing plan aimed at 
cutting costs and boosting profitability polaroids latest 
defensive maneuver includes the elimination of 500 to 800 
additional people through voluntary retirement the repurchase of 
300 million in polaroid stock and the issuance of 10 million new 
shares for an employee stock ownership plan esop 
the esop which gives employees 14 percent control of polaroid 
has been challenged by shamrock in a delaware court shamrock 
opposes the plan because by voting on the side of management 
employees can effectively block a takeover 
six of the companys 27 officers have agreed to leave including 
senior vice president and treasurer harvey h thayer senior vice 
president of strategic planning milton s dietz and joseph j 
mclaughlin group vice president of worldwide marketing three 
other vice presidents were also among the group 
as further incentive for early retirement employees who leave 
immediately will be paid through nov 30 
if that doesnt work booth said we will have to rely on 
layoffs 
recalling earlier words of assurance that apparently all but 
excluded layoffs booth told his managers i didnt expect to be 
in this type of warfare when i made my pledge

foreign minister mesut yilmaz on friday 
urged eec nations to remember that turkey is part of europe and 
cautioned against delay in considering his nations bid to be a 
fullfledged member of the european economic community 
yilmaz in his first news conference since assuming the post 
nine months ago said turkeys application submitted in april 
1987 is currently being studied at technical levels by a committee 
the eecs governing body the council of ministers will act 
upon the committee report either turning down turkeys bid or 
inviting turkey to join in talks aimed at arranging full membership 
the message we give to our european friends is that no matter 
what the committee recommends the final decision is basically a 
political one and turkey is politically and strategically a part of 
europe yilmaz said 
turkey will not settle for less than eventual full membership 
yilmaz said 
negotiations for membership should start in a reasonable 
period of time the foreign minister said without citing a 
timetable 
if the trading bloc turns down turkeys application or takes too 
long to review it turkey will review its relationship with 
western europe yilmaz told reporters 
many member countries have opposed turkeys membership on 
grounds that it the country is economically backward or that its 
democracy needs perfecting 
greece which has major disputes with turkey has made clear it 
will block turkeys bid unless turkish troops in cyprus are 
withdrawn

just a few months ago britains economic 
disease of rampant inflation skyhigh interest rates and 
persistent unemployment was pronounced cured by just about everyone 
except the conservative governments staunchest critics 
today the economy is suffering something of a relapse 
exhibiting that old familiar symptom higher inflation and the 
government admits it is troubling 
in addition a hike in interest rates and a sharp widening of 
the trade deficit are worrying economists 
ironically the symptoms cause is the economys vigorous 
growth which is stretching resources and driving up prices like 
its trading ally the united states britain faces the threat that 
its economy could overheat into recession 
the peak came in march when the treasurys top official 
chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced the first 
surplus budget in nearly 20 years and slashed the top income tax 
rate to 40 percent from 60 percent 
since then the attention has turned instead to britains annual 
inflation rate which fed by strong consumer spending has jumped 
from 35 percent to 48 percent in july in his budget speech 
lawson had forecast an inflation rate of 4 percent by the end of 
the year 
to combat higher inflation prime minister margaret thatchers 
no 1 economic priority the government has pushed interest rates 
up more than 35 percentage points since early june 
whatever action is necessary to keep inflation under control 
this government will take lawson told members of parliament in 
late july characterizing the pickup as modest but unacceptable 
strength in the dollar gave the government room to raise 
interest rates without pushing the british pound dangerously high 
but the pound which has been trading at about 320 west german 
marks remains well above a rate of 3 marks which the government 
long had protected 
the pound broke through that ceiling in march raising concerns 
that britains export competitiveness might be hurt indeed the 
trade deficit is much worse than lawson had forecast 
for the first six months of 1988 britain had a current account 
deficit of 56 billion pounds 96 billion compared with a 16 
billion pound 26 billion deficit in all of 1987 the current 
account includes invisible trade such as services and overseas 
investment earnings 
in his budget speech lawson had forecast a trade deficit of 4 
billion pounds 7 billion for all of 1988 
things have deteriorated said ian harwood an economist at 
the london investment firm warburg securities the major part of 
the reason for the deterioration has been the way the economy has 
been growing so much faster than expected 
david owen an economist with the london investment firm 
kleinwort grieveson ltd said domestic demand is just growing 
too quickly for its own good 
the latest survey conducted by the polling organization market 
and opinion research international showed that in july for the 
first time since february 1987 more people thought the state of 
the economy would get worse rather than better over the next year 
economists expect britains gross domestic product its total 
output of goods and services to grow between 35 percent and 4 
percent this year faster than the 3 percent forecast by lawson in 
march and following growth of 44 percent in 1987 
on top of the troubling symptoms there have been recurrent 
reports of a rift between mrs thatcher and lawson over currency 
exchange policy 
these have been fueled by the pounds rise and the governments 
negotiations with mrs thatchers former economic adviser sir alan 
walters for him to return to her downing street office next year 
mrs thatcher advocates freemarket policies while lawson favors 
managing exchange rates through direct intervention in the markets 
and the adjustment of interest rates 
however lawson survived a cabinet reshuffle by mrs thatcher in 
late july and now appears likely to remain until at least after 
next springs budget 
but the economic outlook remains worrying harwood said 
inflation will peak at 6 percent early next year interest rates 
might move higher into the double digits and the trade deficit 
probably will balloon to 10 billion pounds 172 billion in 1988 
harwood predicted 
the government remains upbeat 
the difficulties that beset us are difficulties we have 
successfully dealt with in the past and will do so again without 
drama and without interrupting the steady progress we have already 
achieved lawson said

grain and soybean futures opened mostly higher 
but quickly turned mixed today in light trading on the chicago 
board of trade 
much of the early buying was based on the agriculture 
departments announcement late thursday that it had targeted china 
for sales of an additional 2 million metric tons of subsidized us 
wheat analysts said 
that got things fired up a little bit here the excitement was 
on the wheat said jerry gidel a grain market analyst with gh 
miller a chicagobased commodities trading division of 
britishowned lit america inc 
but light showers and cooler temperatures in the heart of the 
midwestern croplands put pressure on corn and soybean futures 
analysts say the grain markets appear to be responding more 
readily to export news than to weather factors although soybean 
growers would welcome more rain to help their plants through the 
end of the critical flowering and podsetting stage 
at the close wheat was 2 cents to 4 cents higher with the 
contract for delivery in september at 396 a bushel corn was 
cent lower to 1 cents higher with september at 289 a bushel 
oats were 2 cents to 3 cents lower with september at 258 a 
bushel soybeans were 1 cents lower to 9 cents higher with august 
at 880 a bushel 
cattle futures were mostly lower while pork futures were mostly 
higher in early trading on the chicago mercantile exchange 
live cattle were 40 cent lower to 18 cent higher with august 
at 7140 cents a pound feeder cattle were 05 cent to 62 cent 
lower with august at 8195 cents a pound hogs were unchanged to 
35 cent higher with august at 4770 cents a pound frozen pork 
bellies were 85 cent to 163 cent higher with august at 3780 
cents a pound 
pork bellies settled sharply higher on thursday hog futures

gcampc brands ltd on friday launched a new bid for 
irish distillers group plc that values irelands leading whiskey 
distiller at 253 million irish punts or about 354 million 
the 560ashare bid was made hours after gcampc received 
regulatory clearance from britains panel on takeovers and mergers 
to proceed with a new bid for irish distillers maker of jamesons 
and other whiskies 
gcampc a consortiumowned group was restructured as a wholly 
owned subsidiary of grand metropolitan plc on wednesday the move 
was part of a negotiated settlement between the european community 
commission and the three original partners in the consortium 
under terms of the settlement grand metropolitan agreed to buy 
out the interests of alliedlyons plc and guinness plc the two 
other companies involved 
the group originally launched a joint 281 million bid for irish 
distillers under conditions set by the takeover panel gcampcs 
offer constitutes a new bid and isnt technically a revised offer 
the takeover panel had given gcampc until monday to announce terms 
of a new bid and set a 21day limit for the offer to remain open 
gcampcs original offer which was launched in may and amounted to 
446 a share had attracted 2034 percent of the shares by last 
week 
the ec blocked the joint bid because officials said the 
consortium decided in advance to split up irish distillers markets 
and brands which would violate the communitys competition law

few americans need to be told anymore that they 
are living in a global market not with all the european cars and 
japanese cameras they have been buying 
they read stories about british corporations buying out their 
american counterparts and japanese buying up skyscrapers they 
drink mexican beer they wear italian and brazilian shoes they 
stay at foreignowned hotels 
hardly a day goes by that they do not hear about the value of 
the dollar in relation to the pound yen and mark and while they 
might not realize what all the todo is about they recognize it is 
of global importance 
and of course they also hear about the need for american 
companies to export in order to reduce the imbalance of 
international payments which is high on any list of the countrys 
most urgent and exasperating problems 
while all this is not new the understanding of it may even now 
not be fully appreciated because the united states for a century 
had the worlds biggest economy it didnt need to export it 
didnt even think about it 
but now that the global economy is here americans face a big 
question mark in an area they have not yet given much thought to 
the labor market that is also has become globalized and it could 
be affecting millions already 
in fact many economic analysts wonder if global competition has 
not had a lot to do with the stability of american wages over the 
past five years marked especially by unusual calm in labor 
unionmanagement relations 
having lost millions of jobs to lowercost producers in other 
countries organized labor was forced to acknowledge that jobs 
could be exported as readily as goods foreign workers wanted those 
jobs they got millions of them 
the impact of all this however has been overshadowed during 
the past five years by a concurrent phenomenon the enormous growth 
of domestic jobs to some extent it hid the fact that so much 
employment was sent abroad 
now a test is coming 
many economists contend that with the jobless rate now at about 
54 percent of the civilian labor force further declines cannot 
take place without putting upward pressure on wages it would 
ignite inflation they say 
but maybe not in a global marketplace such a situation 
conceivably could be averted by importing goods made by foreign 
workers rather than employing american workers in domestic 
factories 
this factor already was cited in the most recent quarterly 
report of the national federation of independent business the 
impact of operating in a world labor market coupled with good 
inflation experience seems to be keeping the lid on wages 
increases said economist william dunkelberg 
american workers obviously are loathe to lose jobs to foreign 
competition and therefore seem reluctant to seek higher wages 
based on the low jobless rate they seemingly could it used to be a 
regular occurrence when the jobless rate fell but according to the 
survey little pressure is evident yet 
this is uncharted territory for workers the us economy and 
economists 
in this new environment with differing labor demands it will 
be interesting to see how low the unemployment rate can go before 
we encounter significant labor shortages says dunkelberg 
nobody really knows how low that might be because american 
workers know that management has an alternative that is it can 
simply decide it is less expensive to make products abroad than it 
is at home

at the end of their shift the miners 
of jastrzebie trade their cramped quarters in the coal pits for 
their tiny apartments in concrete highrises 
many miners in this town at the center of the latest wave of 
polish strikes must toil seven days a week to supplement their 
wages and gain access to special stores that are open only to 
miners who agree to work weekends 
they say long lines for food irregular family life and constant 
manipulation of their interests by management led to anger 
frustration and the strikes that began tuesday in this mountain 
town of 100000 near the czechoslovakian border 
what kind of a family life can a man have here said a miner 
in his mid30s speaking in his tworoom apartment overlooking the 
mine he asked that his name not be used 
for many miners the outlawed trade union solidarity gave them a 
voice and hope that they could change the way they work and live 
residents are still proud that key agreements between solidarity

and they will never forget the nine miners killed by security 
police at the wujek mine near katowice about 35 miles to the 
northeast after martial law was imposed in december 1981 
suppressing solidarity the series of strikes are for better wages 
and recognition of solidarity 
youve got to have a goal in solidarity you found out you

wolnikowka runs a strike support center in the nearby holy virgin 
mary roman catholic church that supplies sandwiches and coffee 
i didnt sleep all night but its not hard for me she 
said we must get through to the men on strike and its our job 
to organize that 
residents have started collecting money to assist the striking 
miners and their families 
outside the modern july manifesto mine which produces 
highgrade coal for export families line up daily waiting for 
police to allow them through the barriers to deliver food and 
encouragement to their striking relatives holed up in the plant 
bread is scarce in the stores near the mine and beer has 
disappeared 
police patrol the town and are stationed at the entrance to the 
church where the phone was cut early in the strike management has 
refused to allow priests into the mine

was rapidly built up about 25 years ago to exploit the rich coal 
beds 
to attract workers wages were set above the national average 
and the waiting time for apartments was often less than a year 
people in other parts of poland can wait for decades 
children whose lives and future are tied to the mine appear 
immune to the strict police controls darting in and out of the 
dozens of large police vans and trucks around the mine 
our whole town is on strike is america on strike too asked 
one small boy 
residents spend evenings listening to foreign radio stations 
wondering who will support them throughout the country 
are you going to work one miner asked another in the 
elevator of one highrise

donnay sa once the worlds top maker 
of tennis rackets was declared bankrupt friday by a belgian court 
after failing to reach a deal with creditors to restructure its 
massive debt 
the familyrun company is likely to become a takeover target 
and several potential acquirers who had been anticipating the 
bankruptcy are expected to come forward sources said 
donnay climbed to the top rank among the worlds tennis racket 
makers when bjorn borg advertised its products a decade ago but 
the company began to suffer heavy losses after the swedish champion 
retired in 1981 
although its business was declining banks continued to lend 
donnay money asking very few guarantees said fabrice jacquemart 
a spokesman for the government of wallonia in southern belgium 
which has a 27 percent stake in the company 
donnay got this credit line because of its notoriety he 
said but the walloon government and the unions want to avoid a 
takeover for donnays name only 
the unions will be vigilant to avoid that a company takeover 
will be agreed to with the sole purpose of buying the name of the 
brand said union spokesman jacques hardy 
donnays debts total about 14 billion francs or 35 million 
jacquemart said weeks of negotiations with banks and the walloon 
government failed to result in an accord that would have prevented 
the bankruptcy 
creditors refused to provide new funds for donnay which has 
subsidiaries in the united states hong kong brazil and 
switzerland its 1987 revenue stood at 29 million down a third 
from 1986 and its losses totaled 2 million 
the donnay family started a firm in 1910 with six workers who 
made wooden tool handles it moved into tennis rackets in the 
1930s but the business took decades later when donnay contracted 
with borg then a littleknown rookie who went on to win five 
wimbledon titles 
at its peak donnay made over 15 million rackets a year and 
employed 600 people but its output slipped 50 percent and its 
staff was cut to 350 when the companys fortunes started fading in 
concert with borgs retirement 
other problems also dogged donnay the company had trouble 
marketing its products to an international audience as well as 
keeping up with technological changes in the sport 
when rackets shifted from wood to synthetics and fibers in the 
early 1980s donnay lagged the revolution and the company was 
unable to replace borg with one of the new rising stars of tennis

grain and soybean futures closed mostly lower 
friday on the chicago board of trade after early excitement about a 
wheat offer to china faded into a lackluster session with 
relatively light trading 
the agriculture departments announcement late thursday that it 
had targeted china for sales of 2 million metric tons of subsidized 
us wheat gave the grain markets an early boost 
but after that there wasnt a lot of new news and the market 
kind of slipped away said jerry gidel a grain market analyst 
with gh miller a chicagobased commodities trading division of 
britishowned lit america inc 
wheat and corn futures finished slightly lower but soybeans 
posted steeper losses on ideas that fridays light showers and 
cooler temperatures would benefit the struggling midwestern soybean 
crop afternoon readings in the region were mostly in the 70s but 
temperatures in the 90s were expected to return early next week 
at the close wheat was cent to 3 cents lower with september 
at 392 a bushel corn was unchanged to 2 cents lower with 
september at 287 a bushel oats were 1 cents to 6 cents lower 
with september at 259 a bushel soybeans were 12 cents lower to

french automaker peugeot sa its minuscule 
presence in the us auto market continuing to decline is pinning 
hopes for recovery on a new model that europe has named its car of 
the year 
the frontwheel drive peugeot 405 is being offered in three 
models but peugeot officials dealers and industry analysts agree 
its most attractive attribute is its base price of 14500 
we think this car is very right for the marketplace it is a 
range many of our european competitors have gotten away from 
said bill kelly national sales manager for peugeot motors of 
america inc 
the 405 models built largely by robot at peugeots sochaux 
plant in eastern france join the peugeot 505 a basic midsize 
sedan which has been sold in the united states since 1980 
sales of the peugeot 505 have declined drastically in the last 
two years from 14431 in 1986 to 9409 in 1987 through the first 
seven months of this year peugeot has sold 4015 cars compared 
with 5293 for the same period last year 
kelly said the company has projected selling 15405 of the new 
peugeot 405 models in the 1989 sales year and figures on selling 
3505 of the restyled 505 series cars 
peugeots three 405 models are the dl 14500 the s about 
17500 and the 16valve mi 16 21000 
theyve priced it right and it has gotten some good reviews 
said thomas ogrady an analyst with integrated automotive 
resources inc in wayne pa the things theyve got to get over 
are marketing positioning and advertising they do have a history 
of product and dealer problems 
kelly said peugeot will launch the most extensive advertising 
campaign in peugeot history to bring the peugeot 405 to the 
attention of the american public especially the 25 to 49yearold 
male who is making at least 40000 a year 
while he declined to say how much the company will spend kelly 
said the target audience will see the peugeot 405 an average of 29 
times between midaugust and nov 1 on cable and network 
television billboards and in magazines 
the peugeots popularity has been mostly on the east coast but 
kelly said that in the long range he thinks the frontwheeldrive 
405 will find a home with proportionately more midwestern owners 
pascal henault peugeots us president said being the lone 
french carmaker in the 10 millionunit us market is a plus 
because peugeot can have its product identified without confusion 
that accompanies other europeans battling each other in the united 
states 
we are very happy with this lack of confusion he said 
yet peugeots problems with the peugeot 505 its consumer 
reliability in a recent survey was near the bottom and what kelly 
called a disastrous relationship with its dealers will take time 
to heal 
henault said special quality control checks of 300 areas of each 
car imported to the united states should help peugeot gain consumer 
confidence 
kelly said the dealer network is being asked for its opinion on 
many aspects of the business and is coming around of the 250 
peugeot dealers in the united states 20 percent of them carry 
exclusively peugeot products 
in maplewood nj the nations largest peugeot dealer by 
volume last year is happy with the new product one 405 is on the 
showroom floor and seven orders have been written based on 
customers seeing the single model 
the 405 is bringing us a younger crowd where the frontwheel 
drive is certainly important salesman fernando valente said 
were getting a very very positive response

venezuela is sticking a second toe into the 
waters of the international bond market with a new 100 million 
issue 
the 5year eurobond issue is small by the standards of todays 
capital markets but in light of the international debt crisis it 
has a symbolic value it marks only the second time that a 
developing nation debtor has ventured into the world bond market 
since the debt problem began in 1982 
since then third world debtors have raised cash mainly with big 
loans from foreign commercial banks and international organizations 
not by tapping bond investors 
the first testing of the the post1982 waters also belonged to 
venezuela last february the latin american oil producer launched 
its first international bond issue since the crisis a 100 
million issue underwritten by jp morgan securities and banco de 
venezuela a private bank 
although most of the bonds were purchased by venezuelan 
investors the issue was considered a success and emboldened the 
caracas government to try a second time 
there are several reasons why it has been the venezuelans 
rather than other third world debtors who have ventured into the 
market although it too has its problems the venezuelan economy 
with the help of oil revenues is considered more stable than 
those of most other debtor nations the country has paid back a big 
portion of its foreign debt which now stands at around 34 billion 
experts say the new bonds to be issued on monday are really a 
way for the venezuelans to measure the countrys creditworthiness 
in the eyes of foreign investors by nurturing the perception that 
venezuela is again welcome in the capital markets the venezuelans 
could become less dependent on foreign banks the international 
monetary fund and the world bank 
theyre in a kind of quasimarket borrowing status said 
robert mccauley an economist for the joint economic committee of 
congress 
loans from the imf and the world bank are politically sensitive 
since they carry strings often in the form of required economic 
austerity programs in the borrowing countries 
the sensitivity has been heightened in venezuela by the 
presidential election scheduled for early december since the debt 
issue can provide powerful ammunition for the opposition parties 
although carlos andres perez a candidate from the ruling accion 
democratica party is widely expected to win it is not clear 
whether he will continue the governments current debt policies 
even the organizers of the new bond issue acknowledge the 
prickliness of the situation oliver parr a director of samuel 
montagu amp co ltd in london conceded the upcoming election makes 
the timing of the issue not entirely satisfactory 
the foreign debt issue is a highly political matter in all 
latin american countries parr said 
the new bonds will be offered to investors on a highrisk 
highyield basis not unlike the junk bonds that have gained 
popularity in this country as a way to finance corporate takeovers 
the venezuelan bonds carry a yield of 1875 percentage point 
over the london interbank offered rate known as the libor rate a 
widely used benchmark for international issues 
its pretty much a junk spread over libor mccauley said 
other sovereign bonds from triplea borrowers such as 
britain have been offered at the libor rate while south korea 
recently offered bonds at only a quarter point over the benchmark 
rate 
still everythings relative and the venezuelan bonds appear to 
have a better chance than other debtors bonds would 
venezuela is deemed to be in better shape a new york banker 
said its a working political system that can deal with change

as george bush received the republican partys 
presidential nomination this past week the prime rate stood at 10 
percent its highest point in three years 
but the runup in interest rates may not quite play into the 
hands of michael dukakis the democratic nominee the reason in 
1980 under the last democratic president the prime rate peaked at 
more than 21 percent 
all things considered the performance of the us economy seems 
to give more ammunition to bush than to dukakis this season 
from the republican side 
i think its an unambiguous plus for the bush campaign said 
lawrence kudlow chief economist at the investment firm bear 
stearns amp co and a former chief economist of president reagans 
office of management and budget 
from the democratic side 
on a scale from a zero to 100 for bush the economy will be 
kind of an 80 the democrats cant look to a bad economy said 
charles schultze director of economic studies at the brookings 
institution who was a chairman of president carters council of 
economic advisers 
unemployment has fallen to 54 percent from 78 percent eight 
years ago inflation is down to about 4 percent from about 10 
percent in the summer of 1980 
after a pair of short sharp recessions early in the reagan 
administration the nation has experienced the longest peacetime 
economic expansion in history 
i think the challenge for bush is to convince voters that he 
will build on those successes in the 1990s kudlow said 
the dukakis campaign stressed the bad news on inflation this 
past week as various economic reports indicated a possibly 
overheating economy 
record imports contributed to a bulge in the trade deficit 
industrial production shot up and the nations factories ran at 
their fastest rate since 1980 the government said 
together the reports pointed toward higher inflation and seemed 
to bolster the decision by the nations major banks to raise their 
prime rate to 10 percent 
when interest rates were pumped up last week in effect a 
hidden tax was imposed on all working families i think thats bad 
news for republicans said thomas d herman the deputy national 
issues director for the dukakis campaign 
although the economic reports raised some realistic concerns 
about inflation they also undermined democrats claims that the 
economy was growing too slowly 
another way of looking at the economy is with a measure of the 
economys health called the voter discomfort index that is 
maintained by economist albert h cox jr 
the index is a sum of the jobless rate the mortgage rate and 
the inflation rate minus the rate of economic growth the higher 
the worse 
jimmy carter lost reelection in 1980 when the index was a 
whopping 325 reagan won reelection by a landslide in 1984 when 
it had dropped to 174 now it stands just under 16 
bushs biggest weakness is the huge federal budget deficit and 
the nations status as the worlds biggest debtor said schultze 
the carter administration economist 
unfortunately schultze said voters do not necessarily perceive 
democrats as the ones to solve the debt and spending problems 
its very hard to cash in when you dont have an answer for 
it he said 
bushs pledge of no new taxes which he repeated thursday could 
become a liability if voters get the idea that the candidate is 
promising more than he can deliver 
dukakis has said he would raise taxes as a last resort 
kudlow said he believes bushs pledge is realistic but the 
candidate needs to flesh out his announced plan to balance the 
budget by 1993 by holding the growth in spending to less than the 
growth in revenue 
he has to generate the proper arithmetic to give credibility 
to this freeze proposal kudlow said 
schultze said bush cannot generate the proper arithmetic because 
the flexible freeze is a joke its literally a joke 
the plan depends on unrealistic assumptions about lower interest 
rate payments on the national debt and would include politically 
impossible slashes in the medicare budget schultze said 
while the democrats do not have a detailed deficitreduction 
plan themselves schultze said the only thing they are not doing 
is theyre not digging themselves into a hole by ruling out a tax 
increase

washington government officials say national security does not 
appear to be an issue in the proposed sale of steelmaking equipment 
from a shuttered usx corp plant to the government of iraq 
but opponents claim that the sale of the texas works plant in 
baytown would threaten peace negotiations between iraq and iran and 
is a deliberate move by the steelmaker to lessen competition 
republican rep jack fields said friday he is concerned that usx 
would be exporting stateoftheart armorizing technology 
used for tanks and other military applications to a country that 
harbors terrorists and last year attacked a us battleship in the 
persian gulf 
but a commerce department official who spoke on condition of 
anonymity said officials believe the technology is very old very 
outmoded and do not anticipate any national security issues to 
be involved 
echoing that sentiment pentagon spokesman lt col keith 
schneider said on the surface it is not a defense issue 
fields whose district near houston includes the plant has 
asked president reagan the justice department defense secretary 
frank carlucci and commerce secretary c william verity to 
investigate the proposed sale on the grounds that national security 
is treatened and that usx may be unlawfully attempting to eliminate 
competition 
when congress returns in september i think this question 
going to be looked at very closely in terms of national security 
steel supply and that its anticompetitive fields said 
the plant which once employed as many as 2000 people was shut 
down two years ago amid labor turmoil and declining demand for 
steel it had produced up to 13 million tons a year of 
largediameter pipe used in the united states for oil and natural 
gas pipelines 
the works include electric furnaces for melting scrap casters 
to shape molten steel into slabs and a mill for making slabs into 
oil drilling pipe 
iraq already has made a 1 million down payment to usx for the 
20yearold steelmaking equipment which would be dismantled and 
then reassembled in iraq field said 
but two domestic companies are prepared to offer a price 
comparable to what iraq will pay reported friday by the new york 
times to be about 100 million fields said 
among possible domestic purchasers fields listed were major 
financial services corp of tallahassee fla and birmingham steel 
corp of birmingham ala 
fields said usx has made statements that have led me to 
believe they are not concerned about jobs in this country and 
really do not want to sell to an american company they want to 
remove capacity it keeps their prices high 
usx spokesman william p ryder would not confirm the reported 
pricetag on the plant but said usx formerly us steel is 
negotiating the sale of the equipment from the closed facility with 
the iraqi minister of industry 
ryder would not respond further to fields claims 
when youve got domestic purchasers willing to pay as much 
value or more why is usx bent on selling this equipment to iraq 
they are simply anticompetitive fields said i am convinced 
usx is trying to keep the price of steel slab and steel plate 
high 
justice department spokesman mark sheehan said the agency was 
taking a preliminary look to see whether an antitrust 
investigation is warranted 
fields said he met last week with iraqi ambassador abdulamir 
alanbari who requested the meeting a day after fields blasted the 
deal at a capitol news conference 
basically he said he would appreciate me not dragging iraq 
into this controversy i said like it or not mr ambassador 
youre in this controversy 
fields said he suggested the ambassador try to persuade iraq to 
back out because it would be a tremendous humanitarian gesture in 
the interest of jobs since 750 people could be employed if the

since traders had little else to do this past 
week many passed time by musing about presidential politics but 
few based strategies on the prospect of prosperity under either 
michael dukakis or george bush 
in fact some noted if bush had hoped to ignite followers into 
a victory frenzy at the republican national convention by promising 
millions of new jobs low inflation and no tax increases wall 
street wasnt terribly impressed 
nor did the market find reassurance in bushs choice for vice 
president sen dan quayle of indiana a littleknown conservative 
baby boomer who faced intense press scrutiny over questions about 
his military record 
that is not to imply investment professionals believe dukakis 
and running mate lloyd bentsen are any better although some 
studies have shown the stock market has done better under a 
democratic administration 
the election isnt sparking any interest in the market one way 
or another when you look at it its not a contest of two dynamic 
people said philip c puccio senior vice president and manager 
of institutional trading at dillon read amp co in new york 
i feel the institutionalinvestor community is looking ahead 
into 1989 and no matter who gets in were in for a lot of 
trouble puccio said there will be hard decisions that will 
have to be made regarding our trade and budget deficits higher 
taxes the street is looking at that 
despite the cynicism some said bushs vow in his thursday night 
acceptance speech to keep taxes down may have played a role in a 
mild rally the stock market enjoyed early friday one of the few in 
an otherwise dreary week 
robert otoole manager of overthecounter trading at shearson 
lehman hutton inc in new york said bushs battle cry helped a 
little bit 
likewise when the market strengthened last tuesday despite 
alarming news about a worsening trade deficit some brokers thought 
it was a reaction to the bush nomination process and called it a 
republican rally 
others called that thinking ridiculous conjecture 
i think the markets are sophisticated enough to concentrate on 
the fundamentals said richard wholey a brokeranalyst at wayne 
hummer amp co in chicago its easy and convenient sometimes for 
market professionals and journalists to look for those type of 
answers most researchers will tell you there isnt a measurable 
effect 
judging from the markets behavior this past week he was right 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials hit a threemonth low last 
monday then moved in a narrow range finishing friday at 201600 
for a weekly loss of 2152 
the new york stock exchange composite index rose 101 to 14754 
the nasdaq composite index for the overthecounter market fell 
153 to 37742 and the american stock exchange marketvalue index 
fell 145 to 29503 
volume on the big board averaged 14461 million shares a day 
against 18008 million a day the week before it was the lowest 
average weekly volume since late may 
paul campbell jr a stock analyst at nikko securities co 
international in new york said that if there is any market 
reaction to a presidential candidate the effects are seen over 
time not daytoday 
its not one of these things when someone says oh gee hes 
a good guy lets buy stocks campbell said 
although the candidates may not directly influence wall streets 
behavior at least one forecaster contends the markets direction 
can predict who will win the election with uncanny accuracy 
yale hirsch publisher of the stock traders almanac contends 
the direction of the dow jones average between the close of the 
last presidential convention and election day mirrors voter 
sentiment 
he bases the theory on the premise that of the the 14 
presidential elections since 1900 in which the incumbents 
triumphed 12 were foretold by rising stock prices 
in other words if the dow average is lower on nov 18 than its 
202703 level last thursday dukakis will win conversely if the 
average is higher bush will win 
whether pattern or happenstance the 
postconventiontoelectionday forecaster has its critics 
its an absurd game but hirsch takes this very seriously 
said robert sobel a market historian and author of several books 
on wall street 
from 1900 to 1960 in most elections the presidential 
candidate with the longer name won that means dukakis will beat 
bush

cocoa futures prices dropped sharply friday on unconfirmed 
rumors the ivory coast had sold some of the 135000 metric tons it 
has been withholding from the market in hopes of selling at higher 
prices 
on other markets crop futures finished lower livestock and 
meat futures were mixed precious metals declined energy futures 
rallied and stockindex futures advanced 
the ivory coast on africas northwestern shore is the worlds 
largest cocoa producer and exporter accounting for about onethird 
of the 19 million metric tons of cocoa beans produced in the 
198687 season 
its production for the current season which ends sept 30 is 
estimated at 620000 metric tons but it has sold only 485000 
according to a recent research report from shearson lehman hutton 
inc 
analysts said that for the past several months the ivory coast 
has been holding out for higher prices for the remainder of its 
198788 cocoa 
they have made one or two sales where dealers were prepared to 
pay their high asking prices said arthur stevenson an analyst 
in new york with prudentialbache securities inc 
but harvesting of the new crop will begin late next month or 
early in october and their warehouse space is finite so a 
substantial amount of this will have to come onto the market 
stevenson said 
unconfirmed rumors that the ivory coast had sold some of its 
cocoa on thursday caused panic selling of cocoa futures friday on 
the london terminal market where prices plunged the permitted 
daily limit 
the price drop was not as steep on new yorks coffee sugar amp 
cocoa exchange but new lifeofcontract lows were set for all 
delivery months 
in new york cocoa settled 31 to 50 lower with the contract 
for delivery in september at 1321 per ton

board of trade after early excitement about a wheat offer to china 
faded into a lackluster session 
the agriculture departments announcement late thursday it had 
targeted china for sales of 2 million metric tons of subsidized 
us wheat gave the grain markets an early boost 
but after that there wasnt a lot of new news and the market 
kind of slipped away said jerry gidel a grain market analyst 
with gh miller a chicagobased commodities trading division of 
britishowned lit america inc 
wheat and corn futures finished slightly lower but soybeans 
posted steeper losses on ideas that fridays light showers and 
cooler temperatures would benefit the struggling midwestern soybean 
crop afternoon readings in the region were mostly in the 70s but 
temperatures in the 90s were expected to return early next week 
wheat settled cent to 4 cents lower with september at 391 a 
bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with september at 287 
a bushel oats were 2 cents to 6 cents lower with september at 
259 a bushel soybeans were 12 cents lower to 2 cents higher 
with august at 869 a bushel 
cattle futures finished mixed on the chicago mercantile exchange 
amid profittaking and expectations of declining cash prices next 
week said thomas morgan president of sterling research corp of 
arlington heights ill 
hog futures were mixed with strong cash markets offsetting fears 
of increased slaughters next week he said

cent higher with august at 8210 cents a pound hogs were 70 cent

a late burst of computerdriven selling wiped 
out measly gains in bluechip stocks friday and contributed to 
another mixed finish on wall street capping a sluggish week that 
traders would just as soon forget 
nobodys committing any money said robert otoole manager 
of overthecounter trading at shearson lehman hutton inc in new 
york were going to be in the doldrums for a while 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials up slightly through 
most of the day weakened rapidly in the final minutes and ended 
with an 1103point loss to 201600 putting the indexs decline 
for the week at 2152 
traders blamed the late reversal largely on computergenerated 
selling programs linked to expiring stock options which 
contributed about 20 million shares to an otherwise dreary day on 
the new york stock exchange 
despite the loss in the dow average the broader market was 
mixed in composite nyse trading gaining issues held about a 
4to3 edge over declines with 794 up 624 down and 522 unchanged 
the fundamental reason for stockmarket apathy is concern about 
rising interest rates and the direction of the economy in the 
opinion of many market strategists with treasury bonds offering 
increasingly attractive returns investors arent eager to risk 
their money on wall street 
if and when the market believes interest rates have peaked 
then well see renewed interest in stocks said robert meyer 
director of research at the new york investment firm fahnestock amp 
co when you can get fairly decent yields in shortterm bonds 
its pretty tough to compete 
volume on the floor of the nyse totaled 12237 million shares 
down from 13982 million the previous session and the lowest level 
in more than three weeks nationwide consolidated volume in 
nyselisted issues including trading at regional exchanges and on

federal regulators merged eight insolvent texas 
savings and loans friday including the biggest firstquarter money 
loser into one institution that will be run by the government at a 
record cost of 25 billion 
federal home loan bank board spokesman david colgren said the 
government estimates it will spend another 3 billion over the next 
decade bring its total infusion to 55 billion by 1998 
the merger outlined by the fhlbb is the biggest under the 
governments southwest plan which is designed to eliminate 
ailing sampls in the region through consolidations it also 
respresents the largest bailout in the thrift industry 
the announcement comes a day after federal regulators said they 
sold 12 insolvent sampls in texas to an investment group headed by 
william gibson a continental illinois corp vice president the 
federal savings and loan insurance corp had promised to put up 
13 billion in government assistance while the private sector 
contributed 48 million in cash 
the thrifts combined thursday form the new institution of 
american federal bank fsb which will be based in dallas 
in the latest deal the combined thrift will have assets of 69 
billion and will be called sunbelt savings fsb borrowing its 
name from dallasbased sunbelt savings association which was one 
of the eight merged thrifts sunbelt lost 12 billion in the first 
quarter of this year a record for the industry 
the new institution will be headed by thomas j wageman who has 
been managing the statechartered sunbelt savings association for 
the past two years 
the fslic which is providing a 25 billion note to eliminate 
the losses of the consolidated institution says it plans to shrink 
sunbelts size with the intention of selling it to investors next 
year 
once we finally implement consolidation and untangle the loan 
participations the surviving institutions will be much more 
attractive to a buyer fhlbb chairman m danny wall said in a 
statement 
it is in our best interest and that of depositors and others 
in the texas thrift industry for us to shrink these institutions to 
their core business 
the bank board said depositors of the eight merged thrifts will 
be able to conduct business as usual because all branches of the 
former institutions are now operating as officers of the new 
sunbelt it said the same contracted rates and terms on all 
certificates of deposit will continue to be honored 
besides sunbelt savings association texas the other thrifts 
involved were western federal savings amp loan association a 
dallasbased sampl which ranked 12th in losses for the first quarter 
and independent american savings association of irving ranked 20th 
in firstquarter losses 
the other institutions involved included first city savings 
association of irving federated savings amp loan of brady multibanc 
savings association of alice texana savings amp loan association 
texarkana and summit savings association of dallas 
george barclay president of the federal home loan bank board of 
dallas said the consolidation is another fslic initiative to 
stabilize the thrift industry in texas which has been hard hit 
by slumping oil and real estate markets 
the transaction brings to 20 the number of insolvent thrifts in 
texas that have been eliminated this week and 32 since the 
southwest plan began three months ago when the plan began 109 
texas thrifts were insolvent 
wall said thursday the fhlbb expected to complete the plan at 
the end of the year

polaroid corp said friday it has 
received expressions of interest from several corporate suitors 
other than shamrock holdings inc and forstmann little amp co but 
the company declined to name the potential bidders 
girding for a takeover battle polaroid said this week it would 
offer early retirement to hundreds more employees including a 
quarter of its top executives the cambridgebased film products 
firm also warned employees that layoffs may occur if the voluntary 
incentives dont work 
wall street analysts said they doubted the costcutting would 
dissuade potential buyers 
i think the news that theyre going to cut another bulk of 
their employees out is positive for the company but will it stop a 
takeover absolutely not said alex henderson of prudentialbache 
securities inc 
the thinking on wall street is the likelihood of further 
action on polaroid stock by potential suitors is extremely high 
there is too much smoke not to have some fire henderson said 
polaroids board of directors voted unanimously tuesday to 
reject a hostile offer valued at about 3 billion from shamrock 
holdings inc a california investment company controlled by roy e 
disney the company also has rejected a friendly offer from 
forstmann little a new york investment firm 
the warning of potential layoffs came from i macallister booth 
polaroids president and chief executive officer in a question and 
answer session with highranking executives on wednesday 
portions of the session were replayed on videotape thursday 
before hundreds of employees at a meeting that the company says was 
intended to be closed to the public but was attended by a boston 
globe reporter 
this company is like a family to me booth said on the 
videotape when my family gets attacked i fight and when my 
company gets attacked i fight too 
as an incentive to retire employees who leave now will be paid 
through nov 30 if that doesnt work booth said we will 
have to rely on layoffs 
referring to an earlier statement in which he had virtually 
ruled out layoffs booth told the executives i didnt expect to 
be in this type of warfare when i made my pledge 
asked about the suitors booth said forstmann little along 
with lots of others have talked to us 
a company spokesman said friday that although polaroid has 
received routine letters and expressions of interest from potential 
buyers it is not actively discussing a takeover with anyone 
the boston globe also reported the company increased its target 
for the total number of retirements to 1500 
we do expect to streamline the workforce by a greater number 
than what we had originally announced which was 500 to 800 but i 
cant confirm 1500 or any other figure company spokeswoman 
marcia phillips said friday 
phillips said polaroid plans to issue a very detailed 
statement on its restructuring in a few weeks and it would be 
premature to say very much before then 
phillips said seven of polaroids 27 top executives have elected 
to take early retirement 
in previously announced defensive moves polaroid said it would 
eliminate 500 to 800 people through voluntary retirements 
repurchase 300 million of its stock and issue 10 million new 
shares for an employee stock ownership plan 
that plan which gives employees 14 percent control of polaroid 
has been challenged by shamrock in a delaware court shamrock 
opposes the plan because it would effectively allow employees to 
block a takeover by voting with current management
