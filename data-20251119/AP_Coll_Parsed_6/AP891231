monkey business the yacht that helped sink gary 
harts presidential aspirations in 1988 is for sale and its 
captain says notoriety from harts trip to bimini with donna rice 
hurt business 
the charter boat which is docked at turberry marina in miami 
is on sale for 15 million capt butch vogelsang said in a report 
published sunday in the denver post 
the 83foot yacht briefly became a household name in 1987 when 
miami model donna rice was photographed sitting on democratic 
presidential candidate harts lap during a cruise to bimini 
the photograph surfaced after published reports that hart and 
rice spent a night together at the candidates washington dc 
townhouse the revelations forced hart to withdraw from the 
presidential race 
vogelsang said he remembers the trip to bimini with hart and 
rice 
ill tell you what happened nothing he said hart didnt 
do anything with the girls a captain knows what goes on on the 
ship i can tell you this the beds werent touching if anything 
hart acted so naive he just kind of stood around he wasnt a 
boatsman 
but the stories about that famous cruise nearly ruined the 
monkey business vogelsang said 
we were dead after the publicity he said we mostly 
charter out for a week at a time and anybody who spends 25000 
doesnt want people staring and saying oh there goes the monkey 
business wheres gary they want privacy 
since then business has steadily improved he said were 
doing about 40 charters a year now

china on saturday said a british plan to give 
special residence rights to 50000 hong kong families was a gross 
violation of sinobritish agreements on the return of hong kong 
to chinese sovereignty in 1997 
the foreign ministry said in a statement it was greatly 
surprised at the british plan and threatened to take unspecified 
retaliatory action 
britain on dec 20 announced it will give residence rights to 
50000 households about 225000 hong kong chinese to help prevent 
a brain drain of the colonys most talented people before 1997 
the british government has argued that guarantees of right of 
abode will ease concerns about chinese rule after 1997 and will 
encourage people to remain in hong kong 
an estimated 42000 people many frightened by chinas bloody 
suppression of the prodemocracy movement this spring have 
emigrated this year and 55000 are expected to leave in 1990 
the foreign ministry statement carried by the official xinhua 
news agency said the british plan is a gross violation of 
britains own solemn commitment made in 1984 when the two 
countries agreed on the reversion of hong kong 
it quoted a 1984 memorandum stating that hong kong citizens with 
british passports can use the passports after july 1 1997 
without conferring the right of abode in the united kingdom 
some 325 million hong kong chinese in the territory of 6 
million people now have british passports but no residence rights 
the foreign ministry demanded that britain reverse its position 
on residence rights otherwise it will have to bear a series of 
consequences arising therefrom the chinese side reserves the right 
to take corresponding measures thereby 
it was not clear why it took the chinese side 10 days to respond 
to the british proposal

another series of collisions on a foggy stretch of interstate in 
northern florida injured 15 people one seriously 
the midmorning accidents in arizona involved about 40 vehicles 
including 16 to 18 tractor trailers said sgt allan schmidt a

quartermile stretch of interstate 40 about five miles east of 
flagstaff in northern arizona officials said 
emergency personnel and equipment were brought in from as far 
away as kingman 160 miles to the west 
this is the alltime worst accident that ive ever personally 
witnessed said coconino county sheriff joe richards a 17year 
veteran 
the extensive amount of injuries damage and death its 
almost unbelieveable its nightmarish in its magnitude 
schmidt initially said six people were confirmed dead but 
flagstaff fire capt paul hellenberg revised that figure downward 
to five including three people whose bodies were pulled from a car 
trapped between three tractortrailer rigs 
then an unidentified 14yearold girl who was freed from the 
same car after more than five hours died of her injuries in a 
hospital bringing the toll back up to six hellenberg said

with injuries hospital spokeswoman lauren bosse said ten people 
were treated and released she said bosse said she did not know 
the conditions or injuries of the others 
at least six people were injured seriously fire capt mike

the accidents closed the eastbound lanes of i40 heading toward 
albuquerque nm for the day westbound lanes were reopened a 
couple of hours after the accidents 
traffic was backed up for several miles and had to be rerouted 
officials said they were investigating the cause 
giovando one of the first authorities on the scene said the 
accidents apparently were the result of icy roads and fog up to 2 
feet of snow has fallen in flagstaff since thursday night 
it was a real heavy fog giovando said we were trying to 
get a hose line then we heard people screaming that they were 
being burned by the fire 
one truck was destroyed by fire officials said 
a shelter for survivors was set up at a local elementary school 
in florida four chainreaction collisions involving 25 vehicles 
closed interstate 95 for more than two hours in both directions 
just south of the georgia border the florida highway patrol said 
nine people were taken to hospitals including a 5yearold boy 
who was in serious condition in the pediatric intensive care unit 
of baptist hospital in jacksonville nurse bonnie lundblom said 
the boys younger brother believed to be about 18 months old 
was in stable condition and doing fine lundblom said

the 28member crew of a greek freighter 
foundering 800 miles northeast of hawaii fled to the safety of a 
coast guard vessel saturday authorities said 
the vulca with a load of scrap metal bound for south korea from 
los angeles was in danger of sinking with water flooding into its 
forward holds the cause of the flooding has not been determined 
a coast guard plane dropped five water pumps to the 600foot 
freighter on friday after the ship radioed a distress call but 
none of the pumps were working by saturday evening because seawater 
continued flowing into the holds chief petty officer dennis 
hubbard said 
if the water was contained to just the two forward holds the 
vulca had a chance of remaining afloat until a commercial salvage 
ship arrived monday to tow it to honolulu hubbard said 
the coast guard cutter sassafras which arrived on scene earlier 
saturday tried to tow the vulca out of the wind which was blowing 
the water over the bow but the effort failed hubbard said 
the sassafras which replaced a commercial tanker that had come 
to the vulcas aid was to stand by the abandoned freighter until 
it sank or the salvage ship arrived he said 
the coast guard previously had erroneously identified the ship 
as the bulka

president bush says hes looking forward to an 
opportunity to shake hands with us servicemen wounded in 
panama but that its too early to make sharp reductions in us 
troops there 
we dont want to act too precipitously the president said 
saturday as he continued to enjoy a yearend vacation in his 
adopted home state of texas 
bush was travelling sunday to san antonio where he was to visit 
two military hospitals the wilford hall air force medical center 
and brooke army medical center 
nearly all the more than 320 us serviceman wounded in the 
fighting in panama were treated at the two hospitals although most 
have since been released fewer than 60 were expected to still be 
there for bushs visit 
i would like to at yearend here salute them once again for 
what theyve done and i will have an opportunity to shake hands 
with some of those kids bush said 
speaking with reporters as he finished a game of golf at the 
houston country club on saturday bush sought to minimize the 
stalemate with the vatican over the fate of deposed panamanian 
dictator manuel antonio noriega 
noriega has been holed up in the vatican embassy in panama city 
since christmas eve the roman catholic church has balked at us 
demands to turn him over to the united states to stand trial in 
florida on drugtrafficking charges 
i think its time to cool it on both sides and let the 
diplomatic process bring this matter to a happy resolution bush 
said 
the president said he had no quarrel with the vatican and might 
even call pope john ii if he thinks such contact is needed to 
reduce tensions 
at the same time bush said the vatican has a history of 
giving asylum to people who are fleeing even thugs like noriega 
bush also conceded that a us raid on the residence of the 
nicaraguan ambassador in panama city was a screwup and 
shouldnt have happened 
but while apologizing to nicaragua for the intrusion bush noted 
the large arsenal of weapons uncovered inside 
i would like to know what the mans doing with rocket 
launchers and grenades and uzis and automatic weapons up to his 
eyeballs in his house bush said it makes you wonder exactly 
what our young men are up against down there 
bush said that while he had no immediate plans to pull out any 
of the some 26000 us troops now in panama he hoped to bring 
some of them home very soon 
i think the sooner we can have our troops that went down there 
out the better it will be bush said

the labor leader 
transport minister moshe katsav of shamirs likud bloc said on

overreaction in breaking up a demonstration by 15000 palestinians

three rubles will buy a cab ride in nome as 
part of a fledgling chamber of commerce project to let soviets 
spend their currency here 
jim stimpfle of the chambers committee for cooperation 
commerce and peace said last week the project is a way to give the 
nonconvertible ruble some value in the united states 
he said he hopes that eventually acceptance of rubles in nome 
will snowball into the ruble becoming officially convertible into 
dollars at a reasonable rate of exchange 
its good will its friendship its solidarity stimpfle 
said 
the ruble project grows from the opening of travel between 
alaska and the soviet far east during the last two years

port town of provideniya in 1989 during the summer an average of 
10 soviets a week were in nome either for a visit or passing 
through he said 
most soviets arrive with 40 from their sponsoring organizations 
in the soviet union he said 
their government prohibits them from taking rubles from home 
but many do so anyway and make blackmarket swaps for dollars with 
alaskans planning trips to provideniya 
stimpfle said 1 in the soviet union here officially brings six 
rubles in nome underthetable rates for rubles vary under the 
chambers plan businesses are encouraged to establish their own 
rates of exchange 
checker cab which charges 3 for a ride in nome has agreed to 
take soviet passengers for three rubles and stimpfle said at least 
two other businesses are willing to consider rubles

spains plans to stage a 
headlinegrabbing 500th birthday party for america in 1992 have 
stirred up a storm of controversy over how portugal is celebrating 
its own discoverers who were charting the atlantic before 
christopher columbus was born 
spain and portugal were archrivals in the push in the 15th and 
16th centuries to sail off the end of known maps and find new 
worlds both succeeded 
but now many portuguese fear their neighbors are stealing the 
limelight for the 1992 fiesta 
at the center of spains celebrations is sevilles expo 92 a 
530acre international fair that is set to end a sixmonth run oct 
12 1992 500 years to the day after columbus reached the caribbean 
island of san salvador 
also making spain hot property in 1992 will be the excitement of 
the summer olympic games in barcelona and the european economic 
community has chosen madrid as its cultural capital on the eve of 
the trading blocs deadline to create a single european market 
compared with all that portugals 1992 celebrations seem 
lackluster 
lisbons governmentappointed national discoveries commission is 
promoting research exhibitions and the publishing of more history 
books about the era 
it has commissioned american composer philip glass to write an 
opera for 1992 release based probably on the lusiads an epic 
poem about vasco da gamas voyages that was written by portugals 
16th century roving bard luis de camoes 
but the spaniards got there first by casting catalan soprano 
montserrat caballe and tenor jose carreras in cristobal colon an 
opera based on trials and tribulations of the genoese captain it 
sold out when it premiered in barcelona in september 
news media executives and even historians here have called for 
more glamour to promote portugals past glories and to show that it 
is a rapidly modernizing european country 
im ashamed at how my country is celebrating the 
discoveries said waldemar de abreu a lisbon publisher and 
editor of the portuguese christopher columbus secret agent of 
king dom joao ii a 600page book that claims proof the explorer 
was portuguese 
portugal could easily have pooled resources with spain and 
staged an iberian discoveries exhibition in 1992 de abreu said 
while admitting spain is pegging all the force of its 
modernization on 1992 vasco graca moura head of the 
commissions executive board makes no apologies for not going 
overboard in that year 
the main difference is that spain is only commemorating one 
date and a short journey columbus voyage in 1492 to the west 
indies he said 
our celebrations began last year with bartolomeu dias and will 
only end in 2000 with pedro alvares cabral 
spurred by their pioneering prince henry the navigators studies 
of astronomy and cartography portuguese seafarers had claimed the 
island of madeira and the midatlantic azores archipelago by 1430 
dias took his ship around the cape of good hope in 1488 leaving 
da gama to open up the sea route to india 10 years later 
cabral discovered brazil in 1500 the portuguese went east of 
india to japan and fernao de magalhaes better known as magellan 
closed the discoveries circle in 1520 by commanding the first 
expedition to sail around the world 
our commemorations match our dimension were smaller than 
spain so honestly we cant be as elaborate said the 
commissions antonio mega ferreira though adding portugal still 
has a few tricks up its sleeve 
lisbon last week submitted its candidacy to the parisbased 
international exhibitions bureau to hold expo 98 a threemonth 
international fair only about a tenth the size of seville 
instead of trying for the olympics portugal is expected to bid 
in january to hold soccers world cup in 1998 
expo 98s theme will be east meets west its hero vasco da 
gama graca moura argues da gamas trips to the orient were as 
important as columbus discovery in the west 
mega ferreiras plans for expo 98 include a subway train 
connecting the undeveloped left bank of the tagus estuary with 
lisbons historic belem district 
belem is already the site of three ornate monuments to the 
discoveries belem tower and jeronimos monastery and former 
dictator antonio oliveira salazars colossal caravelshaped 
padrao a pillar that navigators used to leave behind them on 
land to mark the spread of the portuguese empire 
salazar in 1940 organized an exhibition called o mundo 
portugues the portuguese world that glorified the countrys 
discoveries and african empire to distract attention from its 
isolation in europe and world war ii that was going on around it 
the centerright government has a complex of being linked to 
salazar theyre frightened theyd be accused of nationalism if 
they did more to glorify our history de abreu said but 
nobodys accusing spains socialist government of anything and 
what is seville if not a glorification of spains colonial past

after years of costly delay in solving 
americas nuclear waste disposal problems the energy department in 
1989 expected to take two big steps forward instead it took three 
backwards 
thus four decades after the nation began splitting atoms to 
make electricity for consumers and nuclear weapons for the 
military prospects for permanently isolating the longlived 
reactor wastes from the human environment remain in doubt 
in 1989 the energy department under a new secretary retired 
adm james d watkins was to have broken ground on an exploratory 
shaft at nevadas yucca mountain to study the desert sites 
suitability as an underground dump for highlevel nuclear waste 
nevada resisted and watkins retreated to reevaluate the whole 
project 
progress toward opening a dump watkins said was crucial to 
reviving the civilian nuclear power industry which canceled more 
reactors during the 1980s that it completed public opposition to 
further expansion of the nuclear industry is based in part on 
concern about a buildup of wastes at reactor sites nationwide 
about 18000 metric tons of highlevel radioactive waste 
currently are stored in cooling ponds in 41 states and the waste 
total is expected to double by 1995 
by november watkins had decided the yucca mountain shaft would 
be delayed at least two years because of nevadas resistance and 
other problems also he pushed back the projected opening date of 
a waste dump to 2010 a sevenyear delay 
to make matters worse for watkins nevada in the final week of 
the year told the department it would not grant state environmental 
permits to study the site and then filed suit in federal court 
seeking to force the project out of the state 
the future of the nevada project is likely to be one of the 
hottest items on watkins agenda in 1990 besides the legal and 
political battles with nevada watkins must find someone to manage 
the onsite work the company he planned to pay 1 billion to 
manage the site bechtel systems management inc was disqualified 
by a federal judge in august who said the selection process was 
unfair 
henson moore the deputy energy secretary has sought to cast 
the yucca mountain delays in a positive light saying watkins now 
has a very doable game plan that will restore public confidence 
in the departments ability to complete the project which already 
has chewed up about 500 million of utility ratepayer funds 
a less dramatic but equally troublesome setback for watkins was 
his failure to open in new mexico the nations first permanent dump 
for plutoniumcontaminated wastes from government nuclear weapons 
plants 
as late as june 3 watkins was reassuring the public that the 
800 million waste isolation pilot plant buried in a salt cavern 
near carlsbad nm would begin accepting nuclear waste in 
september as scheduled he cautioned against inaccurate public 
alarm over problems that could delay the project three weeks 
later though he officially abandoned the september starting date 
and said the best he could hope for was an opening sometime next 
summer 
construction of the new mexico dump is virtually complete but 
efforts to certify its safety have been plagued by doubts that it 
would contain the longlived wastes as specified by regulations of 
the environmental protection agency 
delays in the new mexico project in 1989 created yet a third 
waste disposal problem where to temporarily store 
plutoniumcontaminated wastes from the rocky flats nuclear weapons 
plant in colorado idaho which had been accepting surplus rocky 
flats waste imposed a ban last september gov cecil andrus said 
he acted because the department failed to open the new mexico dump 
as promised 
this added still another twist to the waste dilemma since waste 
storage at rocky flats is approaching a limit agreed to by the 
energy department the plant would be forced to close in 1990 if no 
alternative storage can be found early in the year 
watkins in october tried to persuade seven states washington 
idaho colorado nevada new mexico tennessee and south carolina 
to accept equal portions of excess rocky flats waste next year in 
order to keep the plant open but all seven governors turned him 
down and the problem remains unresolved 
stephen a wakefield the departments general counsel said 
last week the rocky flats waste storage limit of 1600 cubic yards 
is likely to be reached by next summer 
because operation of rocky flats is of paramount national 
importance president bush could force states to accept waste 
from the plant wakefield said 
we have the club in the closet but its a last resort he 
said

anglers will find it easier to catch their 
limit of south dakota walleye in 1990 but not because the finicky 
game fish is suddenly more willing to take the bait 
the legal daily catch has been cut from six to four as of 
monday annoying fishermen and prompting warnings that tourism may 
suffer 
the problem is that anglers are getting too good at catching the 
tasty fish 
while fishermen once had to guess where the elusive and feisty 
walleyes were lurking many now rely on electronic sonar units to 
locate them said dennis unkenholz a biologist for the game fish 
and parks department 
theres more people fishing more hours unkenholz said 
theyre using bigger boats and sophisticated fishing equipment 
walleyes are a renewable resource but they can only sustain 
so much harvest he added 
the game fish and parks commission made the unexpected cut nov 
6 and reaffirmed its decision dec 8 the agency said that in some 
places heavy fishing has caused a noticeable decline in the 
quality of the fishery and places the future of the fishery in 
serious jeopardy 
unkenholz said that the reduced limit wont affect many people 
because few anglers catch the limit anyway 
south dakota will see fewer nonresident anglers because of the 
change said larry atkinson chairman of the tourism advisory 
board fishing contributes 70 million a year to south dakotas 
economy he said 
it will have a severe impact on especially the businesses that 
are hanging on by a thread now he said 
bait shops and campgrounds catering to anglers dot the shoreline 
along the four missouri river reservoirs in south dakota walleyes 
also are the main fare in natural lakes in eastern south dakota 
since fishing licenses are not issued specifically for walleyes 
its not possible to say exactly how many people cast their lines 
for walleyes each year in south dakota the state record for 
walleyes is about 15 pounds although most of those caught range 
between onehalf pound and three pounds

seated among relics of old romania in 
his 19th century villa writer marin sorescu recounted how nicolae 
ceausescu and communism strangled almost literally the 
nations intellectuals and the traditions they preserved 
we are an intelligentsia of survivors sorescu said softly 
in the first years of communism intellectuals were 
systematically hunted tens of thousands were exterminated in 
camps he said 
that horror of the stalinist 1950s when teachers priests 
anybody with a brain or mastery of a foreign language was a 
suspected spy or enemy of the people gave way in 1965 to 
president ceausescu 
at first ceausescu appeared to many romanians to be a liberal 
communist leader he permitted more nationalist culture defied the 
kremlin and refused to take part in the invasion of czechoslovakia 
in 1968 
1968 was a big trap sorescu recalled sitting in the 
favorite room of his bucharest home lined with books paintings 
and other examples of traditional romanian culture after that he 
said evil became a way of life 
the terror was horrible and sacrifice was continuous every 
year said the slim moustachioed writer imagine if the 
jacobin terror had lasted 40 years 
according to sorescu the terror peaked for intellectuals in the 
early 1980s when ceausescu decided to impose his order on the 
writers union one of the last bastions of potential resistance to 
his increasingly paranoic rule 
sorescu was one leading intellectual who while avoiding open 
dissidence refused to go along with the constant pressure to sign 
his name to prepared poems eulogizing ceausescu to inform on his 
friends or to live and write as ceausescu thought fit 
as a result he received death threats on the phone and in his 
mail neighbors and other informants would keep careful watch on 
his house 
in 1982 he spent three months under house arrest after he was 
linked to a conspiracy against ceausescu for dedicating a book 
to a member of a group of arrested transcendentalists 
the constant surveillance and awareness that all conversations 
in his house were bugged meant that sorescu never uttered 
ceausescus name and never discussed with friends where his 
manuscripts were hidden 
despite the repression he managed to publish some 30 volumes of 
poetry essays and plays in romania but he said all were missing 
banned passages or verses that he could only publish abroad or keep 
in his drawer 
the leading couple couldnt bear any popularity beyond their 
own he said of nicolae and elena ceausescu they were jealous 
jealous of the living and of the dead 
for this reason sorescu said ceausescu forbade any celebration 
this year of the centenary of the 19th century writer mihai manescu 
sorescu cautioned that the revolution that toppled ceausescu 
dec 22 is not over yet the social mechanism of communism has to 
be destroyed he stressed 
when we see the underground tunnels the double walls in every 
building the fact that people could simply disappear he said 
we will realize what torture our lives were until now and wonder 
if we escaped psychologically sane 
for sorescu the network of terror inspired him to write and to 
reject several offers to live abroad knowing he should stay and 
preserve the romania he said ceausescu was destroying 
repression created the contrary for sorescu it gave me 
extraordinary energy to write he said

houston home away from home for president bush is suite 271 in 
the houstonian hotel two bedrooms and a parlor at the government 
discount rate of 88 a room per night plus access to a worldclass 
fitness facility on a wooded 22acre estate 
the houstonian here in bushs adopted hometown not 1600 
pennsylvania avenue is his legal residence its the only home he 
has left in texas 
it is a short jog from his old neighborhood and not far from 
the glittering galleria shopping center and skyscrapers of this oil 
town where bushs political career got its start 
bush and his wife barbara spend five to 10 nights a year at 
the houstonian the rest of the time the presidential suite is 
open to other wayfarers for 550 a night a good deal steeper than 
the flat 88 per room the houstonian charges bush and other 
government workers in his entourage 
it is not the ritziest hotel in houston by a long shot but it 
does boast a worldclass health club and a milelong astroturf 
jogging trail that snakes around the houstonians campus hard by 
the buffalo bayou and just outside the loop the main artery around 
houston 
the houstonian actually is more of a retreat center for 
corporate conferences than a carriagetrade hotel 
joe smith the traveling salesman we dont get said general 
manager louis r lanzino 
bush started hanging his hat at the houstonian after selling his 
old home nearby when he moved to washington in 1981 to become vice 
president 
why did bush choose the houstonian 
its a great place for him its secluded its got a 
wonderful health club familiar surroundings said stephen hart 
a deputy white house spokesman 
its close to ottos barbq and friends in the houston 
country club added hart singling out two disparate touchstones 
of bushs existence in houston 
ottos an unpretentious cafeteriastyle eatery remains a 
favorite bush haunt and bush winding up a yearend vacation got 
in a round of golf saturday at the houston country club which 
costs 35000 to join 
he has to be from somewhere said craig miller concierge at 
the adjacent inn on the park who still remembers bush as his local 
congressman 
the houstonian does not get a lot of guests requesting to sleep 
in the presidents bed 
every now and then the local democrats rent it and have 
something in there they think thats fairly clever said miller 
our presidential suite is a very nice suite but its not 
overdone said lanzino choosing his adjectives carefully he 
described the bushes as very downtoearth people and the suite 
is reflective of that 
the houstonian is owned by a local developer joe russo and a 
saudi businessman ahmad mannai with 300 hotel rooms and 35 
conference rooms it was near capacity when bush and his entourage 
of aides secret service agents and communications specialists 
rolled in friday night 
most houstonian rooms have servibars that offer guests 
snacks and drinks for a price but not bushs suite 
weve been asked to not have servibars in there said 
lanzino the president likes diet soft drinks and fresh fruit so 
we have that available all the time 
if the hotel rooms are modest the health club is not from the 
full size gym to racquetball and tennis courts sauna massage and 
a locker room where attendants dispense both fruit juices and 
heineken beer in cans there is an indoor track with computerized 
pacing lights that loops around nearly 80 yards worth of weight 
machines treadmills stairwalkers and other musclebuilding gear 
the president claims that we have the best masseuse in the 
world here said lanzino 
the compliment is for a 47yearold onetime south vietnamese 
major called john who charges 40 for a onehour massage 
john his real name is huynh duy nguyen came to be a masseur 
fairly late in life he was trained in kung fu in vietnam but 
abandoned the martial art after seriously injuring a friend in the 
fight 
now he uses his hands on the backs of the president of the 
united states and other clients 
my job i love it he said mr president is a very 
special customer hes very good for me

despair created the swiftest 
revolution in the remarkable year that rid six east european 
countries of stalinism what took years in poland months in 
hungary and weeks in east germany bulgaria and czechoslovakia 
was accomplished in a few days in romania 
but the countrys new provisional leaders face the most complex 
task of any eastern europeans improvising a democratic government 
from the ground up after inheriting the remnants of a totalitarian 
system 
the revolt first stirred dec 15 in the western city of 
timisoara when hundreds overcame the fear of nicolae ceausescus 
regime to defend an ethnic hungarian pastor who had battled for 
religious and human rights 
inspired young workers and students took to the streets of 
timisoara to cry for bread and freedom their massacre reported to 
romanians by radio free europe their lifeline to each other and to 
the outside world stirred the rest of the country and sparked 
unrest in several cities 
the revolution reached the vital center of the country 
bucharest after ceausescu returned dec 20 from a threeday visit 
to iran he branded the timisoara demonstrators hooligans and 
organized a rally to support his views 
it was when he called romanians terrorists and hooligans that 
it was enough said bogdan lazaroae a 21yearold bucharest 
student we work hard for him to build his golden palaces and he 
calls us terrorists 
students turned the proceausescu rally into an anticeausescu 
protest then held out for hours against security forces who shot 
at them by the morning of dec 22 workers had joined the 
students and crowds swarmed over the tanks sent to mow them down 
the army long held down by ceausescu and used for farming and 
construction rather than fighting switched sides 
ceausescu and his wife elena fled their capital dec 22 as the 
first waves of spontaneous joy and exultation crackled through 
radio and television by then in the hands of revolutionaries 
ion iliescu who is now president and other revolutionary 
leaders were summoned to the radio and television stations by the 
demonstrators 
once on the air iliescu summoned all romanians who wanted to 
restore the country to attend a 5 pm meeting at communist party 
headquarters 
there men and women who had objected to ceausescus rule but 
were kept apart for months or years by watchful security agents met 
other new voices like petre roman emerged roman is now the 
premier 
members of the makeshift government were forced to move around 
in armored cars and shift headquarters by day the population that 
rejoiced at ceausescus downfall and with it the end of communism 
became fearful the old system could return and afraid that 
ceausescus inheritors many of them excommunists would not 
embrace real democracy 
free elections are promised for april a schedule that seems 
impossibly hasty in a country where there have been no politics for 
more than 20 years 
conservative parties banned after the communist takeover in 1947 
are beginning to emerge but in a country where communications are 
poor and radio and television are the only media reaching 
nationwide it is uncertain how much national impact they can have 
by april 
the governing national salvation committee said it is not a 
party and therefore not a contender in the elections 
while adopting some of the language of democracy separating 
its powers for instance from those of the government the 
committee and iliescu have taken enormous power into their hands 
acting as an ad hoc legislature they have repealed ceausescus 
most hated laws opened the borders for romanians to travel 
appointed ministers and taken over the staterun media iliescu and 
his defense minister gen nicolae militaru command the 180000 
army troops and have already without explaining why sacked a 
general who helped them during the revolt 
the declaratory nature of their decrees rings oldstyle 
communist even if the content is liberal revealing how hard it 
will be to overcome the stylistic remnants of ceausescus rule 
dealing with the economy will pose more enormous problems for 
the new government 
pursuing a vision of a greater romania ceausescu burdened his 
traditionally agricultural nation with industries it did not need 
and could not run 
he polluted the land air and water with his grandiose projects 
and destroyed the national heritage in cities and towns forced to 
don the mask of his dreams for the proletariat towering apartment 
blocks that looked modern but hid communal bathrooms and crumbling 
walls 
nothing can reconstruct the thousands of old homes and 22 
churches that disappeared so ceausescu could build the palace of 
the republic and boulevard of the victory of socialism in central 
bucharest 
his selfaggrandizing visions did give bucharest a useful and 
efficient subway system he also apparently managed to pay off the 
foreign debt he ran up for his own glory by exporting the food 
his people needed 
western diplomats in bucharest see the lack of debt as one 
potential asset as romanias new leaders try to rebuild the nation 
other assets are romanias oilfields and its scenic tourist 
attractions romanians also have a flair for business and have 
managed to salvage their peasant traditions on the land that should 
be able to feed them in abundance

the governments war on drugs cannot be won if 
congress does not create more federal judgeships chief justice 
william h rehnquist said sunday 
one of every four criminal cases handled by the nations federal 
courts is drugrelated rehnquist said adding some courts 
especially in border states are approaching the outer limits of 
caseload and fatigue from handling drugrelated cases 
in his annual yearend report on the federal court system the 
chief justice said from a federal law enforcement perspective 
the war on drugs will fail if the judiciary is not given the 
judgeships necessary to do the job 
he urged congress to take immediate action to create the 59 
additional trial judgeships and 16 more appellate judgeships 
requested last october by the us judicial conference the 
policymaking arm of the federal court system rehnquist heads the 
conference 
to date congress has authorized 575 federal trial judgeships 
and 168 appellate judgeships no new judgeship has been created 
since 1984 
rehnquist warned against creating an hourglassshaped law 
enforcement system to battle illegal drug trafficking 
huge personnel assets have been added to bring about more 
prosecutions and huge assets have been devoted to prisons to house 
the convicted he said but without the judge power to handle 
the added workload there will be a bottleneck in the middle 
rehnquist cited statistics indicating that federal trial judges 
now handle nearly four times as many drug cases as they did in 1980 
from about 3000 a year to over 11000 a year 
the greatest bulk of drugrelated cases as well as most 
criminal cases are handled by state courts 
a spokesman for the administrative office of the us courts 
said 68 percent of all new criminal cases filed in federal courts 
in iowa are drugrelated 60 percent in northern west virginia 
statistics indicate that in the area of texas encompassing the 
cities of houston galveston laredo and corpus christi drug cases 
represented 244 percent of all criminal cases in 1985 but now 
represent 536 percent 
rehnquist said one of every 10 cases reaching federal appeals 
courts is drugrelated representing more than half the criminal 
cases handled by the appeals courts 
he also asked president bush and congress to fill existing 
judicial vacancies now numbering 61 
nine of these are judicial emergencies having been vacant 
for over 18 months rehnquist said 
the administrative office said two of those nine vacancies exist 
in federal trial courts in new york city the remaining seven are 
in appeals courts based in new orleans san francisco and the 
district of columbia and in trial courts in pennsylvania colorado 
the virgin islands and guam 
on another subject rehnquist praised congress for recently 
voting to raise the salaries of all federal judges by 35 percent 
as of next january 
and he said a 1988 law that gave the supreme court greater 
discretion over the cases it chooses to review is having a very 
beneficial impact on the courts selection of cases 
through the first two months of its 198990 term the nations 
highest court has granted review in significantly fewer cases than 
in past terms 
referring to the dec 16 killing in birmingham ala of judge 
robert s vance a member of the atlantabased 11th us circuit 
court of appeals rehnquist said it serves as a ready reminder 
that judges like other law enforcement officers find themselves 
literally on the firing line as a result of the duties of the 
office that they hold

two weeks after the revolution broke 
out there still is no official word on how many people died in 
street fighting throughout romania estimates range from hundreds 
to several tens of thousands 
as the first sketchy witness accounts began to trickle out of 
the western city of timisoara where the uprising began the death 
toll was first estimated at hundreds then thousands 
then the revolution spread to other areas in transylvania and 
finally to the capital bucharest as fighting escalated in the 
streets with security forces loyal to nicolae ceausescu battling 
the army and young revolutionaries the estimates of dead rose at 
one point a report set the number at up to 70000 
but only days later french health officials were told about 700 
had died 
initial reports from witnesses and citizens in timisoara where 
security forces opened fire on unarmed demonstrators dec 17 set 
the death toll in the hundreds then appeared to concur in 
estimates of between 2000 and 4500 
at one point there were estimates that 12000 people were 
killed in timisoara more than 7000 of them reportedly executed by 
the security forces after being detained 
but western journalists returning from timisoara and other 
cities in the region where heavy fighting had been reported said 
they doubted those figures and thought the total likely would turn 
out to be much lower 
on dec 22 the day ceausescu was toppled and tried to escape 
the capital by helicopter from the roof of his palace us 
diplomats said they saw 13 killed in bucharest 
but east european news agencies reporting out of bucharest 
before western reporters were able to enter the country said 
hundreds had died 
the following day dr marian palaschivescu said he alone had 
counted 54 bodies and an austrian pilot said he counted 30 bodies 
at the airport after fierce fighting on dec 24 
ninety bodies were counted that day at only one of many morgues 
in the city 
the east german news agency adn reported that the national 
salvation committee seeking to run the country estimated that 5000 
were killed in only two days of fighting 
on christmas day hungarian radio cited authoritative 
sources as saying some 70000 had died and 300000 were injured 
but victor ciobanu the health minister under ceausescu now 
supporting the provisional government said that day that 500 had 
died in bucharest over the previous four days of fighting 
the day after christmas romanians in bucharest began preparing 
to bury their dead and 200 freshly dug graves were counted in one 
cemetery 
french health officials were told this week that 746 people had 
died in the revolution but western diplomats estimated from 
witness accounts and their own assessments that some 10000 people 
had died

a 600foot greek freighter loaded with scrap 
metal sank in the pacific early sunday after its 28 crewmen gave up 
a twoday fight to pump seawater out of its hold and abandoned 
ship the coast guard said 
the vulka went down 800 miles northeast of hawaii 
the crewmen were evacuated to the coast guard buoy tender 
sassafras on saturday when malfunctioning pumps failed to keep 
ahead of the flooding that made the bow dip below the waterline 
officials said 
the cause of the flooding was not determined before the ship 
went down officials said 
there was no immediate estimate of the value of the ship and its 
cargo 
crewmen had used pumps dropped from coast guard planes in an 
effort to keep the ship afloat until a commercial salvage ship from 
honolulu could reach the scene monday said coast guard chief petty 
officer dennis hubbard 
the sassafras also unsuccessfully tried to tow the vulka around 
away from the wind to keep waves from washing over the bow 
hubbard said

prime minister yitzhak shamir ignited a major 
political crisis sunday by firing a top labor party minister he 
accused of meeting with plo officials 
shamir accused science minister ezer weizman of defying 
government policy against contacts with the palestine liberation 
organizationxand of conspiring behind the prime ministers back 
with the plo 
vice premier shimon peres the labor leader said shamirs 
action provoked a very serious crisis 
the prime minister must rescind his decision he said on 
armed forces radio adding we have nothing to compromise about 
energy minister moshe shahal a leading labor figure suggested 
shamir wanted to torpedo the political initiative to avoid a 
showdown with the united states over proposals for talks with 
palestinians and elections in the occupied territories 
a meeting of american egyptian and israeli foreign ministers is 
scheduled for january in washington 
labor leaders planned to meet with peres to determine what to do 
next 
a likud official who demanded anonymity suggested labor would 
stay in the government because it would not want to turn an 
election into a referendum on whether to meet with the plo 
although this was the most serious crisis of the yearold 
government there appeared to be some room for reconciliation 
shamirs dismissal letter does not take effect for 48 hours 
giving both parties time to work out a compromise as they have done 
in repeated past crises over the past six years of coalition rule 
shamir said he hoped the government would not break up over the 
issue he sce labor should not defend weizman because he had 
violated a government consensus against dealing with the plo which 
he labeled a terrorist organization 
heres a cabinet minister who not only acts against the 
government policy behind the prime ministers back with our most 
cangerous enemies but he instructs them how to confront our 
arguments how to conduct their relations with the united states 
and how to spoil our moves 
how long can we suffer this situation shamir said thumping 
his fist on a table 
shamir said weizman a 65yearold former defense minister and 
fighter pilot had passed messages to plo chairman yasser arafat 
and met with plo offcials whom he declined to name 
weizman declined to say whether he met with anyone from the plo 
but said he had met with dr ahmed tibi an israeliarab doctor 
whom foreign reports have identified as a gobetween in israeliplo 
contacts weizman said he was later contacted by israeli security 
agents who advised him on what to say to tibi 
israel radio reported taj the plo meetings continued until 
recently and were held with peres full knowledge and approval 
it said they focused on an attempt to influence the plo to 
accept us secretary of state james a baker iiis plan to arrange 
talks between palestinians and israelis to revive the stalled peace 
plan and the make up of the palestinian delegation for the talks 
israel television said that in recent months weizman talked uuh 
plo officials in meetings arranged by egypt 
it also claimed weizman talked with a plo official in zurich 
switzerland about peace now demonstrations in jerusalem over the 
weekend involving 15000 palestinians israelis and europeans 
the protests which resulted in more than 25 injured and 60 
arrested angered rightwing politicians who claimed they were 
arranged by the plo 
weizman accused shamir of hypocrisy saying the prime minister 
and other israeli officials had met local plo activists and 
indirectly negotiated with the plo through the united states 
but weizman said shamirs action might force the state of 
israel to decide where it is headed we will have to finally decide 
if we talk to palestinians 
i have always said openly in the press tv the cabinet that we 
should talk to the plo 
arafat said in baghdad iraq sunday that neither he nor any of 
his officials had met with weizman but said a planned meeting in 
moscow two years ago was canceled after weizman failed to show up

by the blast he said 
police and fire officials said the explosion was being 
investigated and pacific gas amp electric co crews were on the 
scene trying to determine if the blast occurred inside one of the 
buildings or if it was underground

declared sunday that the communist party is dead and will not be 
allowed to take control as the country moves toward democracy in

commitment to political pluralism and reintroduced the concept of 
private ownership 
in other developments the agerpres news agency reported that 
the former head of the dreaded securitate secret police had been 
detained and army units continued to search for securitate 
holdouts loyal to ceausescu 
but there were no reports of major clashes as romanians 
celebrated their first free new years eve in decades 
one newspaper carried a warning from police asking holiday 
merrymakers not to use fireworks and noisemakers in the capital 
where the streets were filled with nervous soldiers armed with 
automatic weapons 
hungarian television reported that an assailant it did not 
identify stabbed ceausescus son nicu immediately after he was 
shown on romanian television dec 22 
the assailant was arrested while the younger ceausescu underwent 
an operation for his stomach wound which was successful 
hungarian tv said 
nicu ceausescu was the communist party chief in the transylvania 
town of sibiu until the revolution that ousted his father he was 
one of dozens of ceausescu family members who were given positions 
of power 
deputy foreign minister corneliu bogdan one of the members of 
the government that took over after ceausescus overthrow dec 22 
told reporters sunday there is no danger of communists gaining the 
upper hand again 
the communist party is dead bogdan said adding that party 
members are a minority in the current government which will run 
the country until elections planned in april 
bogdan did not say how many communists were in the temporary 
leadership but he said their expertise was needed 
i was deceived bogdan said of his own membership in the 
party i will pay for it he added without elaboration 
he said said soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze would 
visit jan 5 or 6 and said all possibilities are alive for 
cooperation with the soviet union 
iliescu in comments carried by all state media told the 
nations 23 million people that despite stubborn resistance by 
proceausescu forces the revolution has triumphed and will 
remain unvanquishable 
the interim govermnent seeks a large novel political 
pluralism he declared 
iliescu also 
promised a moratorium on expensive construction projects 
undertaken by ceausescu despite widespread privation at home 
these include the danubebucharest canal with a projected cost of 
25 billion and ceausescus pet project the nearly completed 
palace of the republic which has consumed 600 million

and animals raised on leased land as long as they did not demand 
mercurial prices 
agerpres reported the signing of a decree by iliescu providing 
the legal basis for creation of new political parties an 
important step toward free elections 
the decree bans fascist parties and others that propagate 
ideas at variance to the state and law and order agerpres said 
at least six new political parties have emerged since 
ceausescus overthrow 
the decree also states that officials of the defense and 
interior ministries judges prosecutors members of state radio 
and television cannot join political parties to ensure their 
impartiality 
ceausescu ruled for 24 years and refused to accept the reforms 
orchestrated by soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev the revolt 
against him began dec 15 and climaxed dec 22 when ceausescu and 
his wife elena fled

the other three are lieutenant generals 
the agerpres report did not specify what charges if any the 
four faced

execute ceausescu and his wife after a hasty military trial 
there were great risks in guarding him roman was quoted as 
saying by the bucharest newspaper adevarul we had secure 
information that securitate paratroopers were prepared to attack 
the place where ceausescu was and the place was not well guarded 
adevarul the former communist party daily that now appears as 
a nonaffiliated daily and other newspapers reserved much of 
their space for rejoicing over the first new years eve without 
ceausescu 
romanians on the street greeted each other and foreigners with 
cheerful shouts of multi ani which means happy new year as 
they trudged through the snow and slush or stood in long lines to 
buy food for their holiday dinners 
many walked up the hill above the broad street ceausescu named 
the avenue of socialist victory to the 17th century patriarchal 
churchuhere they offered prayers for the dead and asked for 
peace prosperity and freedom in the new year

revolution but the death toll is believed to be in the thousands

the national bank of poland is devaluing 
the polish zloty by 32 percent polish media reported sunday in 
another step aimed at making the currency convertible and improving 
trade prospects 
until now the zloty could not be used for international 
transactions because it is not convertible to other currencies 
polish radio said sunday that the new official exchange rate set 
by the bank will be 9500 zlotys to 1 as of monday banks and 
exchange offices are closed on new years day 
it was the largest devaluation since parliament approved the 
noncommunist government in september the zloty has been devalued 
12 times since then 
the government is supporting the effort to reduce the gap 
between the official rate of the zloty and a legal though 
unofficial rate available to all citizens 
on saturday the unofficial rate legalized earlier this year 
which reflects the former black market rate hovered at about 9000 
zlotys to 1 
the government previously announced it hoped the zloty would be 
completely convertible by monday but finance ministry officials 
explained last week that the unofficial rate will still exist 
however the government intends to try to keep the gap between the 
two rates to a minimum through bank intervention 
creation of covertibility of the zloty has been a centerpiece of 
economic legislation passed by both houses of parliament last week 
the devaluation also occurs before major price hikes expected

a widely watched measure of the labor market 
sent out weak signals in november a business research group said 
in a report for release today 
the conference board said its helpwanted index dropped six 
points in november erasing almost all of octobers fivepoint gain 
the seasonally adjusted index fell to 145 in november from 
octobers 151 and septembers 146 the november reading was 11 
points lower than the year earlier level 
as the decade ends the economy is not now growing fast enough 
to keep up with the rise in the workingage population 
conference board economist ken goldstein said consequently new 
entrants or reentrants to the work force spend a little more 
time finding jobs he said 
clearly this is a weakened labor market but not a declining 
one he said noting that the us unemployment rate probably 
will edge up in 1990 
the jobless rate was 54 percent in november up from 53 
percent in october and the same as in november of 1988 goldstein 
said the rate may rise to 58 percent by june 
job advertising volume fell in seven of the nine regions of the 
country measured by the new yorkbased research group only the 
east south central and mountain regions showed increases while new 
england continued to be the weakest as it has been for several 
months 
the helpwanted index is based on ad volume in 51 major 
newspapers across the country the conference board says ad volume 
has proven to be sensitive to labor market conditions and provides 
a gauge of change in the supply of jobs

the investment portfolio of the average small 
investor tripled in the 1980s aided by the booming stock market 
according to an index compiled by money magazine 
the magazine said its small investor index grew 2005 percent 
during the decade 
at that rate holdings worth 14791 on dec 31 1979 grew by 
the end of 1989 to 44439 which the magazine says is the size of 
the typical individual investors portfolio today the index 
assumes that all earnings were reinvested 
the gain for the decade was equivalent to an 116 percent annual 
return compared with a 6 percent return during the 1970s money 
said after inflation which averaged 51 percent a year in the 
1980s investors saw real annual profits of 65 percent during the 
1970s they actually lost 13 percent a year after inflation the 
magazine says 
the growth of investment portfolios in the 1980s resulted 
primarily from the longest bull market in stocks since the 1950s 
money says 
small investors also benefitted from the boom in moneymarket 
mutual funds which allowed them to earn two to four percentage 
points more on their cash than in the 1970s when they generally 
kept cash in lowyielding passbook savings accounts 
for 1989 small investors saw their portfolios increase by 145 
percent on average according to the money index again much of 
the increase was due to the runup in stocks
