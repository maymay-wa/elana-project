a leading renegade military officer 
sought in coup plots against president corazon aquino was arrested 
early hursday as he left a restaurant in a manila suburb officials 
said 
former lt col reynaldo cabauatan wearing civilian clothes and 
a disguise of eyeglasses and a goatee was unarmed when military 
agents took him into custody in pasay city shortly after midnight 
according to brig gen pantaleon dumlao 
dumlao said cabauatan tried to get away and urged officers to 
shoot him but he stopped when one of them placed a gun to his head 
and threatened to shoot dumlao added he said earlier that 
cabauatan offered no resistance 
cabauatans brother jimmy and a friend were detained with him 
outside the japanese restaurant but were released officials said 
mrs aquino praised the military for the capture and told 
reporters the arrest will lead to greater stability in this 
country 
dumlao said agents surrounded the restaurant and waited outside 
for five hours for cabauatan to leave after getting a tip he was at 
a party there 
he said they were not certain it was cabauatan because of his 
disguise so agents approached him and saluted dumlao said they 
grabbed cabauatan when the former colonel returned the salute 
dumlao said cabauatan a former philippine constabulary officer 
was taken to constabulary headquarters at camp crame for 
interrogation he said cabauatan faced three possible criminal 
charges but he did not specify the charges 
cabauatan was the most prominent antiaquino military figure 
seized since the december 1987 capture of former lt col gregorio 
gringo honasan leader of an aug 28 1987 coup attempt that 
left at least 53 people dead 
honasan escaped last april from a prison ship in manila bay and 
remains at large 
cabauatan was sought after a january 1987 coup attempt when 
renegade soldiers stormed military and news media facilities in the 
capital the government called it an attempt to restore ousted 
president ferdinand marcos to power 
cabauatan also took part in an abortive putsch at the manila 
hotel in july 1986 and was believed to have been linked to an attack 
on the stockade at manilas fort bonifacio in april 1987 
cabauatan went underground and was later dropped from military 
rolls as absent without leave in statements to reporters he 
claimed to have organized the nationalist army of the philippines to 
continue his struggle against mrs aquino 
maj gen ramon montano commander of the philippine 
constabulary told reporters thursday there were very strong 
indications that the money being used by this group came from 
expresident marcos he did not elaborate 
defense secretary fidel ramos identified cabauatan as one of the 
major military figures sought in armed attempts against the 
president 
oliver lozano a rightwing lawyer said he spoke by telephone 
with cabauatan minutes after his arrest and said cabauatan will 
cooperate so the truth will come out 
lozano said cabauatan opposed violent attempts to overthrow the 
government but sought change through peaceful democratic and 
legal means 
he said cabauatan supported a campaign by former lt col rolando 
abadilla to forge genuine reconciliation between mrs aquino and 
marcos mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos to return from exile 
in hawaii where he fled after a popular uprising toppled his 
administration three years ago 
abadilla former intelligence chief of the manila area was also 
charged in the january 1987 coup attempt but was acquitted by a 
military court in december 
in another development a relative of mrs aquino charged 
wednesday that an american consulting firm was hired by vice 
president salvador laurel to undermine the government 
but a spokesman for the company black manafort stone and kelly 
of alexandria va said it was simply helping the opposition 
organize a political party before the 1992 presidential election 
during a speech to the house of representatives rep emigdio 
tanjuatco said the company monitored activity in congress and in 
the executive branch relevant to the philippines as part of an 
effort by laurel to discredit the government 
laurel broke with mrs aquino last year and announced he was 
organizing an opposition movement

in 1980 50 standup comics tried their luck on 
audition night at new yorks improv two were robert townsend 
and keenan ivory wayans they quickly became friends and ended up 
cowriting hollywood shuffle a film largely financed by 
townsends credit cards that turned into one of last seasons 
surprise movie hits 
now wayans is showcasing his own talents by writing directing 
and starring in im gonna to git you sucka a takeoff on the 
blaxploitation films of the 1970s 
a few years ago me and some friends were sitting around and 
talking about the movies we used to go see wayans said in a 
recent interview the conversation went from remember this 
movie to remember this scene we started laughing and that was 
when airplane was coming out and that was kind of a blueprint for 
me 
starting with the death of junebug spade from an overdose of gold 
chains he was ready to die the preacher boomed im gonna 
to git you sucka takes on such movies as superfly and 
shaft and turns them upside down 
wayans who also cowrote and coproduced the eddie murphy 
concert film raw plays jack spade who helps capture those 
responsible for his brother junebugs death assisting spade are an 
aging band of tough guys played by exfootball stars jim brown and 
bernie casey and musician isaac hayes who wrote the theme to 
shaft 
that was the coolest thing wayans said to be able to work 
with those guys and then to watch them get up there and be totally 
uninhibited thats because they got it they didnt take themselves 
seriously they were having a good time in retrospect they could 
see where the humor was 
fans of national lampoons animal house will recognize john 
vernon the dreaded dean wermer of faber college vernon is the 
villain again in im going to git you sucka he plays mr big 
the man behind the proliferation of gold chains 
my first choice was shelly winters wayans said initially 
it was still going to be mr big but you wouldnt have ever seen 
her face 
wayans project took a long time to get to the screen when the 
film was conceived in the early 1980s he was a relatively unknown 
standup comic and actor it was a time when hollywood studios were 
not interested in financing an all black film they were however 
willing to reconsider if wynans would agree to make a few minor 
changes 
i went to vestron and they kept coming up with the most bizarre 
ways to integrate the cast they could think of how about if i get 
anthony michael hall the breakfast club sixteen candles to be 
my younger brother a kid that was left on the doorstep of my house 
and act black for the entire film and how about if we make one 
of the guys like charles bronson they wanted so desperately to 
integrate it they didnt care if they undermined the picture 
but the success of hollywood shuffle and spike lees shes 
gotta have it made the studios more receptive to wayans project 
and he ended up getting united artists to distribute the film 
it was a lot easier to go in and sit down and really talk 
before we did hollywood shuffle if it was an all black act no 
one wanted to touch it 
wayans grew up in the washington heights section of manhattan 
one of 10 children he was trying to make people laugh as far back 
as he could remember and had plenty of time to display his talents 
at the family dinner table 
there was always an audience and we were always competing he 
said dinner time was sitting at a long table with my parents at 
each end the objective was making the person across from you spit 
food 
his early heros were richard pryor and the late freddie prinze 
who also grew up in washington heights but while those comedians 
had traumatic and tragic lives prinze committed suicide just as he 
became a star wayans has no interest in being a tortured 
artist 
it wasnt a psychological thing where i had a horrible family 
life and i wanted the audience to love me he said there are 
those who just find humor in almost anything who have warped senses 
of humor which im a victim of i just find everything funny and i 
like being funny 
although mr big mutters ominously at the end of the movie that 
there will be no sequel wayans is anxious to continue making 
films and also to help other blacks break into the business 
the recognized pool of talent is so small that the opportunity 
is tremendous said wayans who found roles for antonio fargas 
steve james and his brother damon among others theres a building 
pool of talent right now 
but wayans couldnt help adding i used them all in the movie

the court of appeals on tuesday overturned 
a murder conviction because sheriffs deputies were allowed to wear 
rubber gloves in court to protect them in case the defendant was 
infected with the aids virus 
the opinion by judge charles e orth jr said it was likely the 
sight of deputies sitting behind bernard wiggins wearing gloves led 
jurors to believe he had aids and should be withdrawn from public 
circulation and confined in an institution with others of his ilk 
the specter of the dread disease aids hovered over the trial 
orth said in the unanimous ruling by the sevenmember court the 
trial judge refused to exorcise it despite wiggins persistent 
and vehement protests 
the court returned the case to prince georges county for a new 
trial 
wiggins was convicted in november 1987 of the murder of bjorn 
haug whom he had met at a bar in his hometown of washington he is 
in the maryland penitentiary in baltimore 
according to trial testimony haug returned to wiggins 
apartment where he was knocked unconscious and loaded into the 
trunk of a car by wiggins and three friends 
the group drove into prince georges county where haug who had 
regained consciousness was killed by wiggins according to 
testimony 
prosecutors told judge jacob levin that haug had been diagnosed 
as having aids that a codefendant and roommate of wiggins carried 
the aids virus and that wiggins and his roommate were homosexual 
although wiggins had not been tested for the virus levin said 
there was a strong possibility or probability that he had it 
and denied a motion by defense attorneys that the guards not be 
allowed to sit behind wiggins while wearing gloves 
the appeals court also ruled tuesday that levin should have 
granted a defense motion not to admit items stolen from haugs 
apartment that were found in wiggins apartment because they were 
not listed in a search warrant

tell eric robinson the date you were born 
and hell immediately give you the day of the week you first drew 
breath same with dates in the future hes a human calendar 
yet its only weeks since the 19yearold autistic savant 
mastered buttoning his own clothes allowing him to trade 
elasticwaisted trousers for his first buttonup levis 
eric will graduate june 2 from a special education program that 
has taught him the joy of work in an alien world by the time he 
earns his diploma eric hopes to have found a lifes work in numbers 
a recent issue of the viewmont high school newspaper dubbed eric 
the schools rain man he shares many traits with the movies 
title character but there are important differences 
erics calendar calculations and aptitude for figures dont make 
him a prodigious savant like raymond babbitt played by dustin 
hoffman but unlike babbitt erics mania for numbers and improving 
social skills let him hold down a job they loved him in trials at a 
video store and the school library 
tests show eric to be mildly retarded as well as autistic and a 
savant a mix that puts his promising quest for work in a post 
office or city library on a very uncrowded plane 
they are usually so incapacitated in other ways that their 
skill wont help them said dr edward r ritvo of the ucla school 
of medicine one of the countrys leading authorities on autism 
indeed those who knew eric when he was younger are surprised at 
his blossoming sociability greetings in the corridors are returned 
with a notsonervous hi and he has somewhat relaxed the 
obsessive routines and rituals that govern an autistic life 
i was worried because i had heard that they got worse as they 
got into adolescence and families had to decide what to do with 
them with eric just the opposite happened he just seemed to 
improve said candace robinson his mother 
hes just a huge success story for parents with autistic kids 
who normally feel isolated frustrated and believe its a burden 
that will never let up said cindy anderson erics special 
education teacher 
years ago andersons first autistic student spoke only in the 
secondperson and was prone to unpredictable rages that injured 
herself and others eric her third autistic pupil is the first 
savant and the only one to shine at the community vocational 
opportunities anderson arranges 
i think hes trying to understand peoples feelings she 
said its a very rote process a very mechanical process 
autism absorption in selfcentered subjective mental activity 
is a severe disorder present in four of 10000 births an 
overwhelming majority of them males its cause is unknown but 
evidence suggests chemical or structural abnormalities in the brain 
among its characteristics is a profound disability in forming normal 
human attachments or in showing or receiving affection 
eric stiffens up when hugged even by his parents and wont let 
on if hes sick or in pain 
a study by ritvo and others published in februarys american 
journal of psychiatry shows about twothirds of those with autism 
have some degree of mental retardation scoring below 70 on 
standardized iq tests 
only about 10 percent of autistic people fall into the savant 
category and far fewer of those are mentally retarded other 
studies show 
mrs robinson believes her son who hoards bus schedules and 
loves to read the phone books he gets at christmas performs his 
calendar gymnastics by visual rather than mathematical means 
i used to wonder if he was calculating dates but i really 
believe its a matter of having a photograph in his mind of our 
100year calendar i asked him dates in the 1800s the other day and 
he couldnt do it she said 
thats erics explanation too elicited in what is typically a 
onesided conversation with a stranger he nervously checks his 
watch every few seconds 
how do you figure out what day somebody was born i have a good 
memory 
what do you want to do after graduation have a job 
something with numbers yes 
hes a whiz at simple math and his memory for numbers is as 
convenient as it is vast he makes a great phone directory says 
brother dan 
i think about anything he sees hes likely to remember said 
mrs robinson who spent hours a few years ago making flash cards of 
multiplication tables only to have eric render them useless by 
memorizing the answers the first time through 
peggy graham manager of video usa in this salt lake city suburb 
accepted eric for an hour a days training on a twoweek trial 
basis he stayed for 1 years quickly memorizing the shelf code for 
every videocassette in the store and eventually mastering the 
computer to check in movies 
he was amazing with numbers graham said but it took him six 
months to routinely talk to other employees and much longer to pass 
time with customers i used to stand by the door and say eric 
you cant leave until you say goodbye to everybody he would 
finally mumble goodbye 
the emotional connection is the last to be made by an autistic 
child anderson said its so difficult to make people 
understand the excitement you feel when they finally start making 
that connection 
an earlier stint shelving books at the school library gave eric 
command of the dewey decimal system and friendship with the 
onceskeptical librarian he was far less avid about custodial and 
landscaping jobs and anderson believes absence of social 
interaction as much as numbers accounts for that today 
he reaches out to people his social habits are much more 
appropriate she said citing erics response to the death of a 
school administrators wife as expected eric affably recapitulated 
for the bereaved husband the obituary information from the newspaper 
but then he added im so sorry about your wife

former pop singer cat stevens reiterated his 
support for the ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis death sentence against 
salman rushdie saying the authors treatment of islam was as good 
as stabbing moslems in the heart 
stevens who changed his name to yusuf islam when he became a 
moslem in 1979 said tuesday that threatening to kill rushdie was 
the equivalent of the united states using an atomic bomb 
its got to be seen as a deterrent so that other people should 
not commit the same mistake again stevens said in an interview 
with the television show world monitor produced by the 
christian science monitor 
last week stevens denied endorsing the death sentence after his 
statements received harsh criticism in great britain rushdies 
novel the satanic verses has generated worldwide outrage among 
moslems and support for the moslem author in the west 
in tuesdays interview stevens also said negative reaction in 
the united states to his comments is a bit ironic considering his 
former record company recently refused his request to stop producing 
his records 
all i can see is that god works in mysterious ways said 
stevens who was interviewed from a mosque near london where he 
lives some of my records are being destroyed 
several radio stations have refused to play stevens records 
because of his earlier remarks a new york station offered copies of 
the satanic verses to people who brought their stevens records 
to the station 
stevens who said the novels treatment of islam was as good as 
stabbing moslems in the heart suggested that rushdie should 
repent writing the book if he manages to escape the death 
sentence he still has to face god on the day of judgment he 
said so i would recommend to him to sincerely change his ways 
right now

shellie austin begs for money in the subway gets 
valium from a friend and sometimes spends the night with other 
teenagers on a littered sidewalk by the river thames 
at 17 she is one of londons army of homeless youths whose 
numbers critics of prime minister margaret thatcher claim are 
being swollen by the conservative governments radical shakeup of 
the welfare system 
the government is determined to wean britons off what it calls 
the dependency culture to do this it is paying 16 and 
17yearold high school dropouts 5060 a week to become job 
trainees and cutting off welfare payments to those who dont sign up 
more than 400000 now work for their benefits each year and gain 
job experience in the process but those who dont register for a 
one or twoyear yts or youth training scheme have been barred 
since sept 12 from signing on for 33 a week in state aid 
exemptions are available to youths who suffer severe hardship 
such as disability or a violent home and of 4500 applications for 
hardship status nearly 3000 have been accepted 
but critics including some members of mrs thatchers own 
conservative party have forced an acknowledgment from social 
security minister nicholas scott that the reform is causing 
problems and he has hinted he will broaden his discretionary powers 
to help those worst hit 
conservative lawmaker robin squire supports this thatcherite 
concept of workfare but opposes cutting welfare payments 
people who have no real home should be properly looked after 
until they are able to get a job or a yts course he says 
their only alternatives are to either resort to crime or to 
begging gifts or to prostitution he said in an interview 
some see the issue as a test of how far mrs thatchers crusade 
can go in revamping the 43yearold welfare system 
tony morgan who runs the new horizon day hostel near covent 
garden in the heart of london said young homeless often regard job 
training as slave labor they dont think they should be forced to 
do it 
many come from unemploymentstricken northern england or are 
fleeing broken homes and cannot afford accommodation the yts has 
135000 unfilled places yet some youngsters have difficulty finding 
the right slot and others get fired because they dont get on with 
their employers 
theres no transition morgan said either it works or it 
doesnt work any other way you can think of to make money they 
do it most cope very well of course some go under 
austin stepping out of the rain to meet friends in the hostels 
dingy pool room said she left home in september because me and me 
dad didnt get on 
she say she has since slept in doorways under railroad bridges 
and on sidewalks in the socalled cardboard city along the 
thames lately she has found shelter in an abandoned house in 
camden north london 
she says she gave up a trainee mechanic job after four days 
because it was too underpaid and it wasnt worth it she says 
she can earn up to 50 a day begging in subway stations 
im better off how i am now than i was when i was living at 
home austin said her voice wavering there aint no one 
telling me what i should do her eyes are unsteady her face 
flashes a smile then becomes a grimace 
people who are homeless now are all like brother and sister 
she said all theyre worried about is when is their next money 
going to come to buy food if theyve got enough blankets if its 
going to rain tonight 
drugs and violence are endemic illnesses such as scurvy scabies 
and tuberculosis are common the government says london has 23000 
homeless but welfare groups say the total is closer to 40000 and 
growing 
last year the government ended housing subsidies for nearly 1 
million poor grants for buying stoves and beds were changed to 
interestfree loans unemployed people under age 25 now are allowed 
only two to six weeks welfare if they remain in the same region 
the government allocated 36 million last summer to help london 
authorities renovate empty public housing and pay for homeless 
hostels new horizon still must raise 128000 in voluntary aid this 
year 
were professional beggars jokes morgan 
sam hughes 17 from manchester said he was forced off the dole 
into becoming a trainee decorator but his job consisted mainly of 
running errands he quit in frustration 
you try to sleep in toilets or park benches he said 
theres nowhere warm youre shaking all night and all the next 
day youre shaking your stomachs empty you feel dead weak 
he now earns 182 a week working in a grocery store and is 
moving into a working mens club where the weekly rent is 107 
mrs thatcher did me good really she made me find work 
said hughes a gaunt figure with spiked hair 
people whove got something in them theyre going to benefit 
out of this he said but for every one person that does get a 
job 10 people will go homeless and go on the streets

future restaurant 
the israeli daily yediot ahronot said the eatery will be funded 
by american jewish activists and its prices will be subsidized

would be based on israeli cuisine and that some products would be 
imported from israel he said the kosher certificate will be given 
by the chief rabbi of moscow 
kadosh said he plans to travel to moscow in the near future to 
help organize the restaurant and will supervise it through short 
visits 
the aim is not making profit but creating a kosher food place

exchanged consular missions

real estate agent sandra reymann 25 voted for alfonsin in 1983 
but has been disappointed and would rather not vote for a radical in 
these elections set for may 14 but at the same time she would 
never vote peronist or socialist and doesnt think a conservative 
could win 
im not uninformed miss reymann said i read the papers i 
listen to the radio but no candidate stands out she said and 
the ballot she casts voting is mandatory in argentina may be 
blank 
at state in the elections are the presidency some senate seats 
half the house of deputies and provincial legislatures 
three surveys conducted over the past two months have put 
undecided voters at 39 percent 32 percent and 325 percent 
menem is 7 to 10 points ahead of the radicals eduardo angeloz in 
those polls and others but the gap has narrowed considerably 
alvaro alsogaray of the rightist democratic center union trails a 
distant third followed by nestor vicente of the united left 
under the constitution alfonsin cannot seek a second consecutive 
term 
menem and angeloz both provincial governors and lawyers have 
traversed the country and made the requisite swing through europe to 
demonstrate their statesmenship abilities 
positions have been staked out on how to restart the economy 
balance the budget curtail urban crime provide housing pay the 
foreign debt and ease relations between the military and human 
rights groups 
menem 53 and angeloz 57 are both centerright but their 
parties are movements that defy political labeling their parties 
along with the armed forces have provided argentinas presidents 
for most of this century 
menem has tried to play down the peronists black legend of 
violence and administrative incompetence which preceded military 
coups in 1955 and 1976 the latter has tried to distance himself 
from an unpopular government without losing the support of alfonsin 
a veteran campaigner and resources like access to state media 
now and again the two snipe at one another angelos says menems 
proposals are simplistic menem says angelos represents a 
government that fulfilled only 5 percent of what it promised 
but each for the moment seems more interested in polishing his 
own public image menem as the charismatic champion of organized 
labor and the downtrodden and angeloz as the honest administrator 
and family man than in demolishing the other 
i wont let you down is the slogan on menem posters which 
show the candidate with his hair to his shoulders and sideburns 
covering most of his cheeks 
it can be done is angelozs slogan he usually appears on 
posters and in person in a blue blazer and opennecked shirt 
wearing thickframed black glasses and a broad smile 
vicente a lawyer and several times a losing candidate for the 
house of deputies lacks a nationwide constituency and is little 
known outside the capital what he really is aiming to do is 
increase the number of leftist legislators in congress 
alsogaray for the same reasons has little chance of winning 
but the 75yearold military engineer and former economy minister 
and ambassador to the united states is a potential kingmaker 
in a scenario that frustrates menem and makes angeloz credible 
despite any poll no candidate will win enough votes to guarantee 
victory in the electoral college and the 600 electors pick a 
president or failing to do that pass the decision onto congress 
in either case the conservative alsogaray may trade his electors 
for political concessions and his party has much more in common 
with the radicals than the peronists 
in 1983 alsogaray supported alfonsin reluctantly to prevent a 
peronist victory 
angeloz and alsogaray insist their electors will vote for them 
more importantly both have rejected peronist suggestions that the 
runnersup support the candidate who gets the most votes 
maria julia alsogaray a national deputy and key adviser to her 
father in an interview published in the buenos aires herald 
acknowledged that in the end either in the electoral college or 
congress her party might provide the winning margin 
she set no specific concessions the party would demand but 
insisted that any candidate wishing to get our votes would have to 
adhere to the partys platform which calls for the privatization 
of state industries and minimal government among other things

tibetans and chinese this week commemorate 
different sides of a bloody 1959 tibetan rebellion against chinese 
communist rule 
for tibetans friday marks 30 years since they repudiated chinese 
rule and surged into the streets to shield their spiritual leader 
the dalai lama from an alleged kidnapping plot hundreds and 
perhaps thousands died when china put down the revolt 
for the chinese it marks the start of three decades of socialist 
democratic reform in the remote himalayan region 
even before the anniversary date this week more blood was shed 
when tibetans shouting free tibet clashed with police at least 
a dozen people were killed when tibetans marched behind their banned 
precommunist flag and then attacked chineseowned businesses and 
government buildings there is fear of more violence on friday 
exactly what happened on march 10 1959 and in the following 
weeks remains a subject of great controversy and there are few 
nonpartisan accounts a new generation of tibetans said they dont 
know who to believe 
each side abuses the other said a young tibetan woman in 
beijing if you read what is written by the exile tibetan 
government in india then the chinese were invaders and the tibetans 
were right to fight them 
but if you read what china says you think they are right 
the tibetans were wrong she said i can only judge the things 
i see now 
but she and others of her generation expressed bitterness over 
the legacy of the 1959 rebellion tibet has become an armed camp 
and hatred runs deep between the native people and dominant han 
chinese 
china claims its sovereignty over tibet dates to the 13th 
century when the mongols who ruled china sent an army into tibet 
but until chinas red army marched into tibet in 1950 there were 
long periods of virtually no contact between the two actual power 
lay with buddhist monks under the leadership of the dalai lama 
revered as the reincarnation of tibets protector god 
eastern tibetan clans began armed revolt against the communists 
in 1956 but lhasa remained calm until 1959 violence was touched 
off when the local chinese general invited the dalai lama to attend 
a theatrical show 
a rumor spread that the army planned to kidnap the dalai lama to 
force him to attend a legislative session in beijing 
on the day of the show march 10 tens of thousands tibetans 
surged around the dalai lamas palace to prevent him from attending 
some attacked chinese targets 
secular tibetan leaders seized the moment to declare 
independence and monasteries seconded the call 
a long standoff began with the dalai lama inside his palace 
urging both sides to stay calm finally on march 17 the chinese 
allegedly fired two mortar shells into the palace grounds the dalai 
lama and his family fled that night eventually reaching india 
unaware of this the crowd stood guard around the palace until 
march 20 when the chinese army began steady shelling after three 
days the last resistance in lhasa was quelled 
rebel attacks on chinese forces in remote areas continued for 
years but to little effect the chinese blamed the revolt on the 
disgrunted former ruling class and moved to weaken it by dividing up 
the land and forming communes after the pattern set elsewhere in 
china 
they also began a campaign to suppress tibets traditional 
buddhist culture peaking in the 196676 far leftist cultural 
revolution when thousands of monasteries were destroyed and monks 
were jailed or forced into labor 
the small communities of monks and nuns that have grown again in 
the past decade seem radicalized by the experience they have held 
proindependence protests repeatedly in the past 18 months four 
violent clashes with police including this weeks have left dozens 
dead and hundreds injured 
the chinese show no sign of yielding their hold on the region 
ren yinong of the state nationalities affairs commission said the 
government is in constant contact with the exiled dalai lama mainly 
through the chinese embassy in india but he said the two sides are 
unable to agree on terms for starting talks 
except for independence anything can be discussed the 
official peoples daily newspaper said last week as for tibetan 
autonomy the chinese government absolutely cannot make any 
concessions 
the dalai lama has said he is willing to accept less than full 
independence and that his priority is to improve living conditions 
for his people speedy agreement is needed if tibetan culture is to 
be preserved he said last year 
a recent broadcast by the official lhasa radio was not optimistic 
the struggle against separatists it said is an arduous and 
complex affair and all involved must be mentally prepared for a 
longterm struggle

a federal jury tuesday convicted a former aide 
to us sen howard metzenbaum of accepting 1300 in illegal 
payments from two polish immigrants who had sought the senators 
help 
ladd j anthony 47 of cleveland sat impassively with one elbow 
on the defense table when the verdict was read in us district 
court 
anthony said no comment to reporters as he left the 
courtroom 
his attorney elmer a giuliani said it was too early to say 
whether there would be an appeal 
in a statement distributed in the federal courthouse after the 
verdict was read metzenbaum dohio said the decision was the 
end to a sad episode that began in november 1986 when he asked 
the justice department to investigate allegations that anthony had 
been acting improperly with his constituents 
it is illegal for federal employees to accept money or any thing 
of value in return for performing their official duties 
those who are sworn to uphold the law should expect no leniency 
when they break the law metzenbaum said 
no date was set for sentencing 
anthony was convicted of accepting 300 from irena boc who 
testified last week that she gave anthony the money in an envelope 
in 1983 to help her with an application for us citizenship 
waclaw pietrzykowski testified that anthony solicited 2300 from 
him in 1985 to help the daughter of his landlady anni wojcieszko 
with her application to the ohio state university college of 
veterinary medicine pietrzykowski and wojcieszko testified they 
gave anthony 1000 and that he later returned 500 
the trial began march 1 
in closing arguments giuliani tried to shift blame for the 
alleged payoffs to others and to point up discrepancies in testimony 
but prosecutors blamed the discrepancies on time lapses and the 
difficulty polish witnesses had with the english language 
the truth is ladd anthony is the one ripping off these 
people said jackie m bennett jr a lawyer with the justice 
departments public integrity section 
ladd anthony is the one who took advantage of some of the most 
vulnerable people in our society bennett said

attention dieters the musical recipe for a 
wickedly delicious chocolate cake by julia child is being cooked up 
at the kennedy center tonight it takes about 20 minutes to devour 
and it doesnt contain a single calorie 
but composer lee hoiby warns that his bon appetit a new 
musical monologue performed by actress jean stapleton with hoiby at 
the piano may tempt chocolate lovers to break their vows of 
abstinence 
i am tempted not only by the lyrics but by the cake itself 
confesses hoiby who is trying to observe a diet of such macrobiotic 
foods as cabbage brown rice and fish with seaweed 
i often give in to temptation and say ill make up for it 
later he said during a prerehearsal interview i love chocolate 
cake the things that are out of reach are what we love in this 
world 
hoibys piece is based on the videotape of a 1961 television 
cooking lesson by julia child and will be served as the dessert 
course for an evening of hoibys music at the terrace theater 
after its world premiere here hoiby and miss stapleton will 
perform the work at long beach calif on march 31 and at santa fe 
nm on april 9 
on stage miss stapleton sings and pantomimes her way around an 
imaginary kitchen using lyrics taken from miss childs tape as she 
prepares a very special veeery choclately bittersweet 
loooovely cake called le gateau au chocolat leminence brune 
what i love is her wonderful sense of theater the actress 
says shes not just a cook shes a character very rich and very 
humorous 
miss stapleton makes the most of the tv chefs comic touches 
tapping an invisible cake pan and instructing her audience to 
knock out the flour on the floor if you have a selfcleaning 
kitchen like mine 
and she engages in a fastpaced musical race with an electric 
mixer as she beats egg whites in an unlined copper bowl were 
going to see who wins she sings and i think maybe ill win 
because im bigger 
hoiby says bon appetit which takes its title from miss 
childs familiar closing line was composed as a concert 
curtainraiser for a longer work he wrote in 1984 his operatic 
version of the late ruth drapers monologue the italian lesson 
hoiby and associate mark shulgasser came up with the idea of 
using the script of a julia child cooking lesson as a vehicle for 
miss stapleton a veteran of broadway musicals who is better known 
as archie bunkers wife edith on the all in the family tv 
series 
miss stapleton wrote miss child for permission miss child 
happily agreed and sent a batch of her tapes for viewing hoiby 
who watched them for four full days became intrigued by the chefs 
rhapsodic phrases and musical metaphors 
her speaking patterns really grab you the phraseology the 
unexpected little interjections he said there is a kind of 
musical cadence in her speech which one isnt aware of unless one 
starts to set it to music and then there it is 
is there something musical too about chocolate cake 
well you see chocolate cake its a very special moment 
hoiby replied its an indulgence something you dont want to do 
too much of its like a reward you ate all your spinach now you 
can have your reward its put in a very special category as a 
treat 
getting hungry 
after tonights concert members of the audience will gather at a 
reception to nibble on the real thing le gateau au chocolat 
leminence brune prepared from miss childs recipe by the kennedy 
center chef 
the cake is going to be the icing says shulgasser

the boyfriend of a mother of three cannot 
spend the night while the children are home the states highest 
court has ruled 
the state supreme court on tuesday upheld a lower court decision 
to bar the boyfriend joseph dipippo from staying overnight saying 
the ruling raised no major constitutional issues 
civil libertarians expressed surprise at the decision and found 
the remark that the case raised no constitutional questions 
disturbing 
i think that the state of rhode island has made a very poor 
statemeent about women divorced women single parents and their 
children and their collective rights to privacy in their own 
homes said patricia a hurst an american civil liberties union 
attorney for carla j parrillo 
ms parrillo and her husband justin jr were divorced in may 
1986 and ms parrillo was given custody of her children two 
daughters and a son ages 8 13 at the time parrillo was given 
visitation rights 
in june the parrillos returned to family court and ms parrillo 
wanted her exhusband to see the children in a location away from 
her home parrillo wanted his exwife restrained from having any 
unrelated males stay overnight at her house 
ms parrillo contended that her exhusband began to harass her 
upon learning that she was dating dipippo 
dipippo stayed overnight once or twice a week ms parrillo said 
and it caused no harm to her children who were in separate 
bedrooms she told the court that her children liked dipippo but 
she had no plans to marry him in the near future 
parrillo began reducing his support payments when he learned 
dipippo was visiting the high court said 
the children told the lower courts judge in a private meeting 
that they all got along well with dipippo although the son said 
there were times he disliked the man 
but the judge ruled the overnight visits in the presence of the 
children were not conducive to their general wellbeing at least 
in terms of their psychological welfare the high court said 
the judge also had noted that if ms parrillo married dipippo 
the issue would become moot 
ms parrillo appealed saying the judge erred because no evidence 
existed that her sleeping with dipippo psychologically harmed her 
children 
but the high court upheld the family court decision saying that 
ruling was without question directed at joseph joseph may 
still visit the marital domicile overnight with the exception of 
those times when the children are with their mother 
hurst said she hoped ms parrillo would appeal the decision 
the practical effect on carla parrillo is that she is precluded 
from conducting her private activities in the privacy of her own 
home at her discretion she said

the death of a 19yearold navy recruit during 
training a year ago resulted from the services neglect for safety 
procedures and pressure on the training system from higherups 
according to a congressional investigation 
in a report released tuesday the general accounting office said 
lee mirecki of appleton wis died at the navys pensacola fla 
rescue swimmer school in part because of an intimidating 
nonvolunteer atmosphere and inadequate controls at the school and 
its superior commands 
some of the flaws remain uncorrected the gao said and it found 
that of 16 other navy training deaths between jan 1 1986 and the 
end of last year safety problems contributed to five of the 
fatalities 
the bottom line is that navy instructors still are not trained 
to conduct highrisk training and that students still are not 
screened to make sure they can handle the dangers said rep toby 
roth rwis who requested the investigation along with the other 
members of the states congressional delegation 
roth called mireckis death a tragedy waiting to happen 
pointing to gao findings that he was unqualified for the swimming 
rescue course had untrained and unsupervised instructors and was 
prevented from dropping out because of pressure on the school to 
increase the number of graduates it turned out 
this gao report is a catalog of failures by the navy which led 
to lee mireckis death and others roth said at a news conference 
he vowed to follow up to see that remaining problems are resolved 
and asked vice admiral john disher head of the services training 
system to contact families of recruits who died in training to 
tell them what really happened 
the gao said it had discussed its findings with the navy and 
reported that officials generally agreed and were receptive to 
suggestions on how to improve training safety and accident 
investigations 
mirecki panicked during a swimmingpool drill known as sharks 
and daisies in which swimmers must free themselves from an 
instructor who grabs them from behind simulating a drowning person 
after counseling and medical examination he was found not 
physically qualified for the course because of a phobia of being 
held under water 
but despite the findings he was reenrolled in the class and 
forced to undergo the drill again gao said mirecki left the pool 
and clutched an equipment rack shouting such things as i quit 
and please dont put me back in the water but was dragged back 
to the pool by instructors after a struggle in the pool he was 
removed unconscious and could not be revived 
an autopsy found that mirecki probably died of heartbeat 
irregularity caused by extreme fear fatigue and decreased oxygen 
the lead instructor was found guilty by a general court martial of 
negligent homicide and sentenced to a demotion and 90 days 
confinement eight others associated with the class were given 
various administrative punishments including demotions and 
reprimands 
some improvements have been made gao said the sharks and 
daisies drill has been dropped instructors are given better 
training and safety equipment is kept on hand at the swimming pool 
there also is a clearer policy regarding students rights to drop 
out of a course the investigators said 
but the gao said there remains great pressure on students not to 
drop out of a course because it is made clear to them that doing so 
will adversely affect their careers and that there still is no 
system to alert instructors to students with a history of problems

tass did not go into loving detail on what raisa 
gorbachev wore or who did her hair but it did report on what the 
first lady was thinking about some world and domestic issues an 
unusual turn for soviet media 
mrs gorbachev wife of the president and communist party chief 
mikhail s gorbachev spoke at a a reception she gave monday in 
honor of international womens day a soviet holiday that is being 
celebrated today 
she talked about her husbands reform policies and about how the 
worlds women have improved prospects for peace and tass the 
official soviet news agency reported her views 
staterun television frequently shows the stylish russian first 
lady and western journalists interview her but it is rare for 
fellow soviets to be let in on her thoughts 
if people currently are more confident of a peaceful future we 
know that much of the credit goes to women actively working on all 
continents for friendship cooperation and profound mutual 
understanding of nations mrs gorbachev said at the reception as 
reported by tass 
for tass to be covering the reception itself for wives of 
ambassadors and other diplomats in moscow wives of members of the 
ruling communist party politburo and soviet women in various fields 
was unusual 
before gorbachev came to power four years ago kremlin wives 
almost invariably were kept backstage 
mrs gorbachev changed that the attractive 57yearold former 
teacher of marxistleninist philosophy has taken a role somewhat 
resembling that of the wife of a us president 
not all soviets are delighted with the change 
many are taken aback by her wardrobe large and glamorous by 
soviet standards others grumble that she is too involved in her 
husbands work 
on monday mrs gorbachev gave the grumblers some ammunition by 
going public with some of her views 
speaking of her husbands reforms she said soviet people are 
putting into practice plans of revolutionary restructuring we are 
connecting to it the destiny of our country of our nation we want 
our public life in all aspects socioeconomic political moral 
ecological and in the sphere of human rights and freedoms to be 
worthy of a human being 
by transforming and renewing our society on a socialist basis 
on the principles of humanism and democracy we are making our 
country more open for all the nations of the world 
she greeted her guests individually and gave each a bouquet 
reported rebecca matlock wife of us ambassador jack matlock 
shes a very attractive intelligent and vocal woman if they 
let her speak more often everyone would benefit mrs matlock 
told the associated press 
the gorbachevs later attended a televised celebration held in the 
bolshoi theater in moscow to mark international womens day 
this time things were a little more typical 
gorbachev sat on the dais with other politburo members and 
dignitaries 
his wife was in the audience

a bill to protect socalled whistleblowers 
who expose government waste fraud and abuse is back in the senate 
after a compromise between sponsors and the bush administration 
this very well might be the first bill to be signed by the 
president this year sen charles grassley riowa said at a news 
conference tuesday in which sponsors unveiled a revised version of 
the measure 
the bill would ease the way for federal employees to win 
reinstatement if demoted or fired after disclosing mismanagement 
thenpresident ronald reagan blocked the measure by a pocket 
veto meaning he refused to sign the bill and congress was out of 
session at the time he said it could result in the government 
fighting legal battles against itself 
reagans move received heavy criticism in a surprised congress 
and from democratic presidential nominee michael dukakis 
lawmakers agreed under the compromise to give up a provision of 
last years bill that would have allowed a special counsel 
representing employees to go to court said sen carl levin dmich 
in turn the administration agreed to a provision barring the 
special counsel from opposing whistleblowers in any action before 
the merit systems protection board the agency that enforces civil 
service safeguards 
the administration also agreed to greater privacy protection 
under the bill while the senators approved a minor rewording under 
which employees are deemed whistleblowers if their exposure of 
waste fraud or abuse was a contributing factor in the decision 
to discipline them the change inserted the word contributing 
attorney general dick thornburgh promised in a letter to levin 
our cooperation to discourage any amendments in either body of 
congress that might in any way interfere with this agreement 
none of the changes to which we have agreed detracts in any way 
from the congress intent to strengthen whistleblower protections 
the letter said

older americans flexed their political muscles 
last november while interest in choosing a new president flagged 
among other age groups the census bureau reports 
some 688 percent of people aged 65 and over reported going to 
the polls last fall the only age group to show an increase from the 
election four years earlier according to the analysis released on 
tuesday senior citizens voted at a 677 percent rate in 1984 
the elderly have been getting a lot of attention and have 
become a great deal more active then ever before said census 
bureau statistician jerry jennings they are becoming a much more 
selfconscious group than before and are beginning to recognize 
their power 
while the over65 group was tops in turnout the 45to64 age 
segment wasnt far behind at 679 percent last november but that 
was down from 698 percent four years earlier 
turnout by voters aged 25 to 44 fell from 584 percent to 540 
percent and in the 18 to 24 group it dropped from 408 percent to 
362 percent 
overall the census analysis found voter turnout down 3 
percentage points from 1984 and at 57 percent the lowest since 
the bureau began asking about voting in 1964 
as usual more people told the census bureau they had voted than 
there were votes actually cast a phenomenon which the bureau gently 
terms misreporting 
the total vote amounted to about 50 percent of the number of 
people of voting age in the country the postelection count found 
but when the census bureau surveyed about 55000 households two 
weeks after the election 574 percent reported having gone to the 
polls 
does that mean people lie to the census takers 
yes said jennings thats the greater part of it 
the purpose of the survey is not to find out how many people 
voted to do that you have to count the votes jennings pointed out 
the survey compares the turnout among regions and groups of 
people that comparison is valid he said with one group 
misreporting about as much as another 
either way it was a 3 percentage point drop from 1984 and the 
lowest turnout in many years 
at 57 percent the census figure is the lowest ever recorded by 
that agency while the national vote total hasnt been as low as 
half in a presidential year since 1924 according to figures 
compiled by the private committee for the study of the american 
electorate 
the drop in turnout was greatest for blacks and hispanics the 
census study found 
by and large when there is a change in voter turnout it is 
greatest in segments of the population which have the lowest turnout 
to begin with jennings said i suspect that is what is 
happening here 
only 515 percent of votingage blacks said they had cast 
ballots down from 558 percent four years earlier for hispanics 
the decline was from 326 percent to 288 percent 
the white turnout fell from 614 percent to 592 percent between 
1984 and 1988 
women held their lead over males in voting 583 percent to 564 
percent last year in 1984 women had led 608 percent to 590 
percent 
as usual the midwest topped the nation last fall with 629 
percent reporting they voted a drop from 657 percent in 1984 the 
northeast was second at 574 percent down from 597 percent 
turnout in the west fell from 585 percent to 556 percent while 
in the south it dropped from 568 percent to 545 percent between 
1984 and 1988 
education seems to encourage voting with 776 percent of college 
graduates turning out next were people with some college 645 
percent and then high school graduates 547 percent only 413 
percent of those who hadnt finished high school voted and turnout 
was 367 percent for people who hadnt gone beyond grade school 
people with jobs outvoted the unemployed 584 percent to 386 
percent people who own their own home turned out at a 700 percent 
rate while only 398 percent of renters reported voting 
because it is based on a survey the study can be subject to 
sampling error the census bureau estimates the margin of error for 
the overall turnout at fourtenths of 1 percent

the landsat earthsensing satellites appear to 
be getting a reprieve with an administration pledge to keep them 
running and a variety of federal agencies being asked to foot the 
bill 
the two satellites had been threatened with a shutdown when funds 
ran out on march 31 
but thonas n pyke jr of the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration reported that while details remain to be worked out 
the administration is committed to keep the satellite system running 
a shutdown would have amounted to turning off the lights 
closing the door and retiring from the field of remote sensing 
said rep james h scheuer dny chairman of the house science 
subcommittee on natural resources 
the federal agencies that make the most use of the satellite data 
are being asked to contribute to keep the system operating after 
march 31 pyke told the subcommittee it will cost about 94 
million to keep the system running for the rest of the fiscal year 
science committee chairman robert a roe dnj told the 
subcommittee that he has a meeting scheduled with vice president dan 
quayle to discuss details of the funding quayle has been 
coordinating the new landsat funding as head of the national space 
council 
weve got to stop this damned nonsense roe said of the 
landsat funding problem funding was a continuing battle under the 
reagan administration which initiated the transfer of the system to 
private hands 
that transfer to the earth observation satellite company is 
incomplete federal money is still used in operating the satellites 
which measure land use water flow vegetation and mineral locations 
and provide detailed mapping information 
the two satellites are currently beyond their original design 
lifetimes a replacement landsat 6 isnt scheduled for launch 
until 1991 
in the meantime landsats 4 and 5 continue to supply useful data 
if they are turned off for lack of funds the only source for similar 
information would be the french spotimage satellite system or the 
soviet union 
pyke told the subcommittee that the eosat company the private 
firm handling the landsat data has been asked to contribute part of 
the funding to keep the satellites running but no commitment has 
been received 
federal agencies that seem likely sources of funds he said 
include the departments of defense agriculture and interior and the 
national aeronautics and space administration 
rep lamar s smith rtexas urged that the department of energy 
and the national science foundation be asked for assistance as well 
its an absolute shame that weve come to this juncture 
concluded rep dave mccurdy dokla he termed threatening to shut 
down the satellites a pretty expensive game of chicken

president bush forced by a winter storm to 
cancel a trip to pennsylvania and delaware decided it was an 
opportune moment to stay indoors so he held a news conference 
in office barely six weeks bush already has been meeting with 
reporters with greater frequency than any president since franklin 
d roosevelt 
former president reagan only held three news conference in his 
final year in office a level bush surpassed in his first month 
tuesdays session was the third generalpurpose news conference 
that bush has held in the white house although he has yet to make 
an appearance in prime time he also held forth at some length at a 
feb 6 news conference in the old executive office building called 
to announce his plan to bail out failed savings and loans 
and he fielded wideranging questions twice on successive days 
in tokyo during his trip earlier this month to northeast asia 
white house aides cite these appearances to assert that bush has 
held six news conferences so far although the definition of a news 
conference in the bush white house remains a bit blurry 
thats partly bushs doing since he says he wont answer 
questions at picturetaking sessions any time he decides to break 
his own rule the session becomes a mininews conference sometimes 
the white house chalks it up as an oval office press session 
counting these sessions add three more to the list of bush 
questionandanswers encounters with reporters says deputy press 
secretary b jay cooper 
these plus a joint news conference bush held in ottawa with 
canadian prime minister brian mulroney on feb 10 raises to 10 the 
number of times bush as president has stood or sat before 
microphones and answered questions from reporters in a moreorless 
orderly fashion 
bushs moving target for ground rules on what constitutes a 
picturetaking session or socalled photo op and what 
constitutes a news conference has led to some convoluted 
presidential verbiage 
for instance the other day when he wanted to make a statement 
but take no questions he declared the event to be a modified 
limited photo op cum statement sans questions 
bush himself is keeping track of his accessibility 
after one recent session at which he took a few questions bush 
was overheard boasting about his availability to lawmakers sitting 
with him in the cabinet room 
i want these stats out there on how many times hes taken 
questions in case there is a dry spell bush said 
for the record roosevelt held 998 news conferences during his 15 
years in office or an average 69 per month according to the 
gannett center for media studies 
other recent presidents and their permonth averages truman 324 
or 35 per month eisenhower 193 or 2 per month kennedy 64 or 18 
per month johnson 135 or 22 per month nixon 37 or 06 per 
month ford 39 or 13 per month carter 59 or 12 per month 
reagan 50 or 05 per month

the livestock industry is growing even more 
concentrated in the hands of relatively few operators says an 
agriculture department analyst 
while there are still thousands of small livestock producers 
their number has declined substantially in recent decades says 
ken nelson of the departments economic research service in 1987 
the four largest slaughter firms accounted for 67 percent of steer 
and heifer slaughter up from 35 percent in 1979 
meanwhile the market share of the four companies for hog 
slaughter increased to 37 percent from 34 percent the share for 
sheep and lamb slaughter rose to 75 percent 1987 from 64 percent in 
1979 
among producers cattle feedlots show a high degree of 
concentration nelson said of 42081 feedlots in the 13 major 
feeding states which account for 90 percent of all fed cattle 
marketings in the us the 200 largest accounted for nearly half of 
the 1987 marketings 
nelson who writes in the march issue of agricultural outlook 
magazine said firms merge and take over other companies to to 
improve efficiency in management and production and perhaps to gain 
market power some practice vertical integration by taking over at 
least two stages of the production and marketing pipeline 
for example cargill and conagra both major processors have 
interests in grain marketing livestock and poultry production and 
meat processing he said some firms expand horizontally by 
acquiring other firms in different industries the diversification 
cuts risks if one industry goes into a decline 
the trend to fewer meat packers means fewer potential livestock 
buyers in local markets and nelson said shifts from organized 
public markets toward direct sales to packers have cut market 
contacts for many small producers 
larger packers also have acquired some country buying points 
formerly owned by cooperatives or small marketing firms he said 
in a recent survey producers said they had fewer bidders for 
their livestock in 1988 than in 1982 
by and large nelson said the worries of consumers small 
processors and small producers focus on the growing market power of 
the big companies they fear the big firms are cutting prices 
received by small farmers and are boosting consumer meat prices 
nelson said the growth of big companies also gives rise to fears 
of discrimination against independent suppliers small customers and 
workers there are also fears of predatory pricing to force out 
small competitors 
but consolidation could be beneficial if such fears and 
concerns are dealt with he said livestock production and 
processing show economies of scale where larger size of operations 
lowers the per unit costs of production 
large firms can benefit from such economies and at the same 
time invest in product and market development nelson said such 
firms can pass on savings to farmers and consumers savings that 
would not be possible in a less concentrated livestock and meat 
industry 
the question he said is who benefits 
when a few firms dominate the cost savings could stay mostly 
with the firms nelson said where there is competition the 
savings ultimately will show up as lower consumer prices one way to 
keep the benefits of bigness and foster competition is to open up 
world livestock and meat markets to more international competition

despite smaller yields because of last years 
drought vegetable producers nationwide probably took in a record 
dollar value for their crops says the agriculture department 
although there was no estimate for 1988 growers receipts 
likely increased slightly from the record level of 92 billion 
in 1987 because of higher prices the departments economic research 
service said tuesday 
total output of vegetables probably fell about 4 percent in 
1988 because of declines in potato dry bean and processing 
vegetable production the agency said in an outlook report 
assuming normal weather output should rebound in 1989 
per capita use of vegetables which probably declined in 1988 
because of smaller production is expected to return to predrought 
levels this year 
utilization probably will continue to be enhanced by general 
economic conditions in the united states the report said with 
real disposable incomes and employment remaining relatively strong 
domestic demand for all types of vegetable should continue robust 
exports of fresh vegetables which soared in 1988 are expected 
to continue rising this year reflecting the decline in the dollar 
and growth in the japanese market the report said 
one reason for the export increase is a rise in french fry 
shipments to pacific rim countries 
potato prices paid to growers are projected to average even 
higher than the departments initial forecast of 549 per 
hundredweight the report said last years average was 435 per 
100 pounds as a result potato farmers are expected to expand their 
1989 acreage

the agriculture department says private 
exporters have sold china an additional 400000 metric tons of us 
wheat at subsidized prices 
melvin e sims general sales manager for the departments 
foreign agricultural service said tuesday the wheat was part of 2 
million tons authorized feb 27 for china under the export 
enhancement program or eep 
under eep arrangements private exporters can sell us 
commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition 
in selected overseas markets and then collect free government 
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses or subsidies 
sims said the latest sales were handled by cargill inc 150000 
tons and louis dreyfus corp 250000 tons 
the wheat was sold for shipment in april and may and will carry 
an average subsidy rate of 2219 per ton or about 60 cents a 
bushel he said slightly more than 16 million tons are still 
available under the current authorization

the justice departments antitrust chief is 
promising tougher enforcement of laws to preserve competition in the 
airlines industry 
assistant attorney general charles f rule said in a speech 
tuesday that the antitrust division would take a harder look at 
mergers than did the transportation department which gave up its 
authority to review airline deals at the end of 1988 
perhaps somewhat overlooked by dot in the course of 
deregulating the airline industry the antitrust laws have a 
valuable role to play to ensure that a competitive environment does 
not sow the seeds of its own demise rule told the international 
aviation club 
the antitrust division intends to use its newfound authority 
as well as preexisting authority to apply those laws with 
appropriate care in order to ensure that us airline markets remain 
competitive in the years to come rule said 
we will ask whether the merger will result in increased prices 
to consumers by creating enhancing or facilitating the exercise of 
market power without generating offsetting efficiencies he said 
rule said that an unanticipated result of airline deregulation 
has been that carriers have become entrenched in regions even though 
the changes have generally benefited consumers by dramatically 
increasing the efficiency of airline service 
he cited computerized reservation systems which give their 
owners an upper hand in getting bookings despite transportation 
department rules whether or not this advantage represents an 
efficiency it does place new entrants at a disadvantage he said 
rule did not say what position the department would take on the 
proposal to merge the computerized reservation systems of american 
and delta airlines 
the effect of such an acquisition of an ownership interest in a 
crs by the owner of a competing system is not at all obvious rule 
said rather the effects are likely to be very complex and involve 
a tradeoff of costs and benefits our investigation of the 
americandelta agreement should enlighten us about the nature of 
that tradeoff 
combinations of airlines that have regional hubs in the same city 
would be opposed by the antitrust division which unsuccessfully 
urged the transportation department not to allow the twaozark and 
the northwestrepublic mergers rule said 
but rule noted that there are very few such mergers that are 
even conceivable today 
in recent years the transportation department approved nearly 
two dozen airline mergers prompting criticism from consumer groups 
that it was giving the industry too free a hand 
the transportation departments administrative authority lapsed 
on dec 31 1988 the justice department now has jurisdiction over 
airline mergers as it does in other industries 
conn hitchcock director of the aviation law project of public 
citizen a consumer advocacy group founded by ralph nader well 
have to see if words are accompanied by deeds the americandelta 
merger will provide some important clues

the cambodian resistances main backer 
the association of southeast asian nations has lessened its once 
firm support for a un peacekeeping force in postwar cambodia and 
for other key resistance proposals a guerrilla leader says 
prince norodom ranariddh also said tuesday that he would leave 
for the united states this weekend to ask washington for more covert 
aid to force vietnam to be more flexible at the negotiating table 
the resistance has repeatedly requested arms but washington 
provides only limited nonlethal aid 
ranariddh is the son of central cambodian resistance leader 
prince norodom sihanouk and commands one of three guerrilla groups 
resisting vietnams 10yearold occupation of cambodia 
he told a group of reporters that aseans support for the 
resistance proposals weakened at peace talks last month in 
indonesia asean mediated those talks which brought together 
vietnam and the warring factions in cambodia 
ranariddh said he was troubled by the shift 
he said only a un peacekeeping force can prevent renewed 
fighting and a return of vietnamese troops who have said they hope 
to withdraw next year or by brutal khmer rouge guerrillas 
vietnam and the government it installed in cambodia have opposed 
introducing an armed international force 
i am very sorry for the sake of my people that the asean stand 
is not as firm as before ranariddh told a group of reporters 
he said a majority of asean delegates at the conference did not 
support an international peackeeping force and no longer clearly 
support the idea of an interim postwar government under prince 
sihanouks leadership and comprised of the three resistance factions 
and the vietnambacked regime 
they do not support even the idea of having free 
selfdetermination and free elections in cambodia he said 
in 1982 asean sponsored the formation of the guerrilla 
coalition it gives the group sanctuary and arms and leads the 
diplomatic struggle against vietnam the noncommunist asean 
includes thailand indonesia singapore malaysia brunei and the 
philippines 
the guerrilla coalition joins the nationalist forces of sihanouk 
and son sann with a group they strongly distrust the militarily 
potent khmer rouge the fanatical communist group killed hundreds of 
thousands of people when it ruled cambodia from 1975 until vietnam 
ousted it in the late 1978 invasion 
ranariddh would not name the asean countries whose support had 
weakened nor say why that support had weakened he said however 
that said a notable exception was singapores prime minister lee 
kuan yew 
in january thai prime minister chatichai choonhavan was host to 
an unprecedented visit to thailand by hun sen premier of cambodias 
vietnameseinstalled government 
some diplomats said chatichai has seriously weakened the 
resistance in his rush to get a settlement and transform cambodias 
battlefields into markets for thai goods ranariddh has said his 
father who had quit as resistance coalition president resumed the 
post in february to counter the increasing worldwide support for hun 
sen 
ranariddh said that during his trip to washington he would tell 
officials that other steps are needed to weaken the khmer rouge 
aside from us attempts to pressure china to halt its aid to them 
he expressed optimism that china which arms the guerrillas and 
the soviet union which arms vietnam will reach an agreement on 
cambodia during their summit in may he said they recently had 
converged on many points and all that remains was for the soviets to 
guarantee a vietnamese pullout and the chinese to guarantee in turn 
that the khmer rouge will not return to power 
if they will overcome this the settlement is finished 
ranariddh said

president bush says hes been told by a fellow 
from lubbock texas not to worry about all the insidewashington 
talk about an administration aimless and adrift all the people in 
lubbock think things are going just great the president says 
if bush wants assurance that the people will tell him when things 
are going just great and not so great all he has to do is wander 
down pennsylvania avenue to the national archives storehouse of the 
nations records an exhibition there celebrates 200 years of the 
people petitioning the government or giving it a piece of its mind 
exhibit a along those lines comes from a boy named anthony who 
was in hb milnes school at fair lawn nj when president ford 
pardoned president nixon for the crimes of watergate anthony had a 
fixed mixed opinion 
dear president ford 
i think you are half right and half wrong 
yours truly 
anthony ferreira 
bush replacing reaganites with bushites also would find 
familiar echoes in the 1789 complaint of mary katherine goodard who 
lost her job as postmaster of baltimore after serving through the 
tough days of the revolutionary war 
said her petition she hath been discharged without the 
smallest imputations of any fault and without any previous notice 
whatever these are but poor rewards indeed for 14 years 
faithful services performed in the worst of times 
to no avail she didnt get reinstated 
the constitutions first amendment gives the people the right 
to petition the government for a redress of grievances but even 
before the government existed the american people were exercising 
their right to talk back to authority 
in 1773 the governor of connecticut petitioned a member of the 
british parliament to protest the closing of the port of boston in 
retaliation for the boston tea party he wrote we are at a loss 
to conceive how the destruction of the east india companys tea 
could be a just or reasonable ground for punishing so severely 
thousands of innocent people 
seventeen years later pennsylvania quakers petitioned for the 
abolition of slavery the blessings of liberty ought 
rightfully to be administered without distinction of colour to all 
descriptions of people 
some petitions to government have been eloquent some funny some 
moving 
annie davis a slave from northern maryland whose mistress 
refused to let her join her family wrote to president lincoln she 
urgently wanted to know her status you will please let me know if 
we are free 
one of the biggest petitions ever to reach washington remains in 
the condition received in 1893 rolled up on two huge wooden spools 
nearly seven feet high it consists hundreds of sheets taped 
together bearing an estimated 150000 signatures appealing for a 
new bureaucracy 
we the undersigned hereby most respectfully petition that 
there be founded a road department similar to the agriculture 
department for the purpose of promoting knowledge in the art of 
constructing and maintaining roads 
congress obliged by creating the office of road inquiry in the 
department of agriculture must have pleased the petitions creator 
a bicycle manufacturer 
few petitions have had as deep an impact as the one earl gideon 
wrote in pencil in 1961 from his prison cell in bay county fla 
where he was serving five years for breaking into a poolroom the 
question is very simple i requested the court to appoint me an 
attorney and the court refused 
the supreme court agreed its landmark gideon decision upheld the 
right of poor defendants to be represented by lawyers at the public 
expense if need be

flattery is the first and firmest rule in the 
senate but in a single day the debate on defense 
secretarydesignate john tower produced a series of mutual attacks 
on integrity motives and competence 
senate republican leader bob dole touched off tuesdays fireworks 
when he announced that armed services committee chairman sam nunn 
dga had detailed investigators to check new allegations against 
tower 
partisan unit dole later called it strike force 
highly questionable if not inappropriate republican sen 
arlen specter of pennsylvania said i think it needs to be pursued 
to see where it leads us 
nunn leader of the tower opposition defended himself a short 
while later by saying he had been informed the fbi would no longer 
look into allegations against tower 
he then was asked about republican claims that his effort to 
derail tower is really an attempt to grab power for himself at the 
pentagon or perhaps jockey for position in the 1992 white house 
campaign 
its an onslaught he said the basic rule is if you dont 
have the facts on your side you try to destroy the credibility of 
someone who is presenting them on the other side so i think that 
formula is in full effect right now 
and when democrat dennis deconcini of arizona said that an fbi 
report on tower turned up evidence of wrongdoing republican 
warren rudman of new hampshire replied tartly that wasnt so he 
said at least not the way americans use the term 
im an american too shot back deconcini 
hearing deconcinis retort rudman persisted that tower had 
committed no legal wrongdoing 
shot back deconcini in my judgment its wrong ok 
but the sharpest exchanges were saved for an extraordinary late 
afternoon performance roughly 30 senators stayed in their seats for 
the debate the ultimate courtesy in an institution where most 
lawmakers come to the senate chamber only to cast their votes before 
hurrying back to their offices 
they saw an exchange between senate majority leader george 
mitchell dmaine and rudman who said it was a fact that there 
was no evidence in the fbi report that tower had ever been impaired 
by alcohol in performing his duties 
mitchell a former judge interrupted to say that was rudmans 
opinion not a fact 
rudman said he had spent 24 years practicing law and knew how to 
read evidence 
i think i know how to do that just as well as you do said 
mitchell who is a former federal judge as well as a lawyer 
im sure shot back rudman a former new hampshire attorney 
general 
nothing was too good to pass up as partisan feelings boiled over 
dole complained bitterly that sen ernest hollings dsc was 
guilty of vicious personal attacks for earlier citing 
allegations contained in the fbi report from witnesses who said they 
had seen tower crocked sloshed and comatose 
hollings protested but dole persisted that the south carolinian 
was an insulter of longstanding he referred to the comment he 
once made about the senator from ohio and later referred to a 
longago crack about the senator from texaco 
the first was a reference to hollings description of sen howard 
metzenbaum years ago as the senator from bnai brith the second 
was hollings onetime description of texas democrat lloyd bentsen 
amidst the partisan crossfire doles irritation with one of his 
republican colleagues virginias john warner slipped out 
dole said that as the senior republican on the armed services 
committee warner had known what nunn was doing but had not passed 
the word along to the republican leadership 
i dont know why he didnt tell me dole said of his virginia 
colleague 
he should have

twenty million folks heard cbs and andy rooney declare that rainx 
doesnt work 
rooney who attended the hearing but did not testify said on the

rainx which is supposed to make rain or snow roll off auto 
windshields and said hed tried the product and found it lacking in 
the advertised qualities 
they cant suppress an opinion just because it doesnt agree 
with theirs jacobs said

president bush is trying to dispel an 
impression that nothing is happening in his young 
administration saying it hasnt been stalled by his struggle to win 
confirmation of john tower as defense secretary 
bush on tuesday responded to news reports that his administration 
is adrift by recounting actions he has taken such as developing a 
savings and loan rescue plan meeting with foreign leaders and 
presenting a budget package to congress 
my response is its not adrift and there isnt malaise he 
said i would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be 
bubbling around that nothing is happening a lot is happening not 
all of it good but a lot is happening 
bush in an impromptu news conference also reiterated his 
opposition to white house intervention in the eastern airlines 
strike he said pilots threatening a slowdown to support the 
striking machinists should not make the innocent traveling public 
a pawn in this dispute 
bush continued to stand by tower as he picked up a piece of good 
news in the senate fight over confirmation a second democrat sen 
christopher dodd of connecticut announced he would vote for the 
nominee 
i believe he is the best man for the job the president said 
of tower im not going to pull back on this 
he noted that tower has pledged not to take another drink if 
confirmed and said youll have 25000 people in the pentagon 
making sure thats true 
to counter allegations that his administration is stalled bush 
cited a phone conversation with a friend in lubbock texas who told 
him all the people in lubbock think things are going just great 
the friend was campaign contributor robert blake an oil and gas 
businessman and longtime friend of bush 
i think were on track bush said 
bush was responding to news reports that the uphill tower 
confirmation fight has diverted attention from other administration 
business particularly appointment of key personnel and that after 
six weeks bushs presidency is floundering 
bush said he would like to see his appointments move more 
quickly but he claimed that he is ahead of where the reagan 
administration was on appointments at this point in 1981 
he acknowledged that trouble in getting a defense secretary 
confirmed was an inhibiting factor in completing a strategic 
review on defense but said i hope theres not going to be any 
slippage in meeting a may 10 deadline 
bush also said he has total confidence in his white house 
chief of staff john sununu the former new hampshire governor who 
has been criticized for alleged tactical errors in the tower 
nomination struggle 
on other subjects bush said 
he has directed his nominee for drug policy coordinator william 
bennett to look into ways to block criminal use of semiautomatic 
assault guns the president a member of the national rifle 
association previously said he opposed banning such weapons but he 
said he told bennett he would take a hard look at any sensible 
answer the drug czar proposes 
there has to be some linkage between us policy toward the 
soviets and the kremlins behavior in central america reiterating 
that he will push at the end of this month for new humanitarian aid 
for the contra rebels in nicaragua bush indicated he is looking to 
the soviets to pull back on their military aid to the ruling 
sandinista government there 
he is as committed to human rights as former president reagan 
was though bush didnt publicly focus on the issue even when 
chinese authorities prevented the nations leading dissident from 
attending a dinner bush invited him to in beijing bush said quiet 
discussion is the best way to voice human rights concerns 
he did not mention chinese actions in tibet where demonstrators 
are protesting chinese occupation and report widespread human rights 
abuses

air traffic controllers were the largest single 
group of federal employees to test positive for illegal drugs under 
the governments program of random testing a published report says 
the washington post reported today that 203 federal workers have 
tested positive out of the 30307 employees tested so far in the 
random spotchecking urinalysis program that translates into a 
rate of 07 percent 
among those testing positive were 60 air traffic controllers and 
42 employees in the nuclear and chemical weapons security program 
the newspaper reported 
the remaining 101 were in a number of positions including jobs 
involving aviation safety enforcement of drug laws and 
rehabilitation of drug users 
the overwhelming majority of those testing positive had used 
marijuana which can be detected in the urine as long as two months 
after being smoked urine samples from 47 employees showed traces of 
cocaine which can remain in the body for three days 
nobody has been caught who has his finger over the button or 
even anybody directly in contact with nuclear or chemical weapons 
said paige eversole an army spokesperson 
john k wallace iii special counsel to the assistant attorney 
general of the civil division said the real danger comes from 
inattention from an unsafe condition someone doesnt notice at a 
nuclear or chemical weapon site 
when job applicants and workers who were acting suspiciously are 
included with workers caught up in random tests at least 49751 
people have been tested with the results revealing a druguse rate 
of 06 percent among reporting agencies the post said

the government says it has concluded what 
most poles have long accepted as fact that soviet forces not nazi 
troops systematically massacred more than 4000 interned polish 
army officers during world war ii 
the statement on tuesday represented communist authorities first 
official rejection of the longtime soviet line on the katyn massacre 
perhaps the most sensitive and emotional issue in sovietpolish 
relations 
we think that everything indicates that the crime was committed 
by the stalinist nkvd the kgbs predecessor government spokesman 
jerzy urban said during his weekly news conference 
the polish government also pressed the soviet union to speed its 
review of the incident the official soviet news agency tass did not 
report the development 
the announcement comes at a crucial moment in monthlong talks 
between the government and opposition on restoring the legal status 
of the solidarity free trade union movement and ending an acute 
economic crisis 
the slain officers were among 15000 polish reserve officers 
rounded up by the invading soviets in 1939 and nazi troops uncovered 
their bodies in 1943 from common graves in the katyn forest near the 
soviet city of smolensk 
each had been killed by a single bullet to the back of the head 
official soviet and polish histories have long held that the 
officers were killed by the nazis who broke a nonaggression pact 
and invaded the soviet union in 1941 but western historians blamed 
the soviets 
no trace was found of the other nearly 11000 reserve officers 
and many poles consider their disappearance and the katyn massacre a 
deliberate effort by josef stalin to eliminate the cream of polands 
intelligensia 
for them the very legitimacy of the ruling communists in poland 
is undermined by the ruthless methods stalin employed in seeing to 
it that they came to power after the war 
poland and the soviet union formed a joint commission in 1987 to 
consider the evidence on katyn and other socalled blank spots 
in polishsoviet history the polish side has submitted its material 
and indications have emerged of growing impatience with the soviet 
review 
last month an official newspaper published a story on a wartime 
red cross report that concludes what western historians have long 
held that the officers murdered at katyn were killed by the 
soviets in 1940 
urban has previously said the inscription on a monument in warsaw 
blaming the nazis for katyn will be changed 
on tuesday he said soviet historians were analyzing historial 
material on the massacre and are right to state that its only 
circumstantial evidence but he said poland wants the soviets to 
speed up their review of the material 
the difficult process of erasing blank spots in polishsoviet 
relations should serve to strengthen friendship between the two 
countries and to support soviet perestroika instead of damaging 
it urban added 
poland was attacked first by the nazis from the west and then 
from the east by the soviet union in september 1939

surgeon general c everett koop has endorsed a 
proposal by two senators to permanently ban cigarette smoking on all 
domestic flights 
the measure introduced tuesday would expand the current 
prohibition against smoking which covers flights of two hours or 
less and is due to expire in april 1990 
the time has come to protect the health and safety of all 
airline passengers said sen frank lautenberg dnj who 
cosponsored the bill with sen orrin hatch rutah 
at the senators news conference to announce the proposal koop 
said such a ban is long overdue 
he cited a recent study by the national cancer institute which 
found that passengers in nonsmoking sections of airliners had 
levels of nicotine in their saliva and urine similar to travelers in 
smoking areas 
the bill would leave intact the 1000 fine that can be levied 
against those violating the smoking ban and the 2000 penalty for 
people caught tampering with smoke detectors in airline restrooms

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan says he sees no reason to change the new catastrophic care 
program financed by a surtax on elderly americans 
were aware of a number of concerns that have been expressed 
about the financing provision but we are also concerned about 
the many examples of our elderly citizens being wiped out 
financially by the tremendous costs of illness sullivan said 
tuesday 
we feel that because this legislation has just been enacted we 
dont have much experience with it yet wed like to follow this and 
see if adjustments need to be made he told the house ways and 
means committee 
leaders in the house and senate also have been generally 
unsympathetic to complaints from senior citizens who oppose the 
financing provision of the program which helps the elderly and 
disabled bear the cost of illness that otherwise would threaten 
their financial stability 
for medicareeligible americans those who are over 65 or 
disabled whose incomes are high enough that they pay at least 150 
a year in federal income taxes the surtax is 15 percent of their 
income tax this year next year it is 25 percent and it could rise 
by as much as 1 percentage point a year after that

predawn arrests of 57 people on poaching 
charges came under sharp attack with one official saying residents 
of the economically depressed san luis valley were entrapped by the 
lure of fast money 
state and federal warrants cited more than 850 alleged wildlife 
violations involving bear bobcat elk deer and bald and golden 
eagles among other animals 
about 275 game officials aided by aircraft made the arrests 
early monday in the valley and the taos nm areas 
gov roy romer said he had been told in advance about the raid 
but was unaware of the planned tactics which triggered at least 30 
complaints from people who said they were unnecessarily harassed 
obviously i am concerned about the feeling the trauma in that 
community romer said tuesday at a cabinet meeting in denver i 
do not criticize the fact we have to enforce the law i simply 
and i do not want to make judgments about how it was done i 
simply know that there was trauma that resulted from it 
costilla county sheriff pete espinoza said wildlife agents kicked 
in doors dragged people outside in their underwear at gunpoint and 
improperly stopped and searched people 
people were crying babies were crying he said they 
wildlife officers didnt care 
galen buterbaugh regional director of the us fish and wildlife 
service in denver denied espinozas charges and said the sheriff 
and others were worried about retaliation 
espinoza said he and his family have been threatened by people 
who assumed he was involved in the operation he said he sent two of 
his children out of town and a third child was wearing a bulletproof 
vest his house was burned down two years ago after he angered some 
residents by breaking up a disturbance at a party 
buterbaugh said so many agents were needed to make the arrests 
because the suspects had threatened federal officials 
the investigation targeted commercial poachers who illegally 
hunt and sell game and used an undercover agent who posed as a 
taxidermist first in fort garland 175 miles south of denver and 
later in costilla nm 
officials said up to 100 could be arrested before the 2yearold 
investigation ends 
buterbaugh said the undercover agent did not encourage poaching 
and paid less than the going rate for carcasses the area was 
targeted because the agent happened to be there and because there 
were reports of a huge market in illegally obtained wildlife 
buterbaugh said 
we always work to make sure that we do not create a market for 
illegal wildlife he said the market there was very large 
the operation was wellperformed in a highly professional and 
highly workmanlike fashion us attorney mike norton said at a 
news conference in lakewood where wildlife officials displayed 
dozens of illegal trophies and carcasses that had been confiscated 
but the sheriff said the agent known in san luis as john morgan 
was known to hang out in bars and place orders with poachers 
he said that encouraged poaching and entrapped residents the san 
luis valley chronically posts 20 percent unemployment one of every 
three people is on government aid 
for that part of the county that is unemployed 500 or 600 
sounds real good to them theyre going to go for it espinoza 
said 
officials would not say how much the agent paid for carcasses 
why did they bring 250 people with helicopters and guns and 
everything else espinoza asked were not animals were human 
beings i dont know what they were expecting a war or something 
this isnt nicaragua 
san luis town trustee augustin jaramillo said the board will 
pass a resolution wednesday asking governor romer to investigate the 
tactics used in this socalled raid

lingering fears left by the chernobyl disaster are 
partly behind the public protests that have prevented a 
nuclearpowered merchant ship from entering eastern soviet ports a 
newspaper says 
the 860foot sevmorput had been anchored off vladivostok for four 
days because the city council there has refused to let the vessel 
enter port the newspaper sovietskaya rossiya said on tuesday 
it said officials in the pacific port city decided march 2 not to 
let the ship dock until they receive additional information about 
its radiation safeguards 
officials of nearby nakhodka and the northeastern soviet region 
of magadan also refused port calls after tens of thousands of 
residents protested to a radio station the newspaper said 
fractures appeared in the 260 million barge carrier soon after 
it began its maiden voyage dec 31 from the crimean port of kerch to 
the far eastern soviet union the newspaper said 
experts found that no radiation was released and confirmed its 
atomic heart was not damaged the article said it did not say 
how the damage occurred or precisely when the incident happened 
according to the newspaper the ship has good safeguards and 
could even withstand the crash of a jetliner or a collision with a 
huge icebreaker but it added 
a deficit of information piled on top of the invisible shadow 
of the chernobyl tragedy and the most complex ecological situation 
in the region detonated a powerful explosion of public 
indignation 
on saturday the newspaper vodny transport said a reactor 
meltdown nearly occurred nov 11 on the icebreaker rossiya while it 
was docked at the northern port of murmansk it said operator error 
was responsible 
public opposition to nuclear power has grown since the explosion 
and fire april 26 1986 at the chernobyl nuclear power plant in the 
ukraine at least 31 people were killed and the plant spewed 
radioactivity that eventually spread around the world 
authorities are closing a nuclear power plant in armenia a 
region prone to earthquakes and have canceled plans to expand other 
plants 
sovietskaya rossiya said the sevmorput was like a sea 
monster uneconomical because of its size it said the ship would 
lose 193 million this year and 229 million in 1990 
it described the vessel as an offended homeless child and 
said every day it is idle costs 88525

yuri andropov became soviet leader 
even at that time we had forces who understood that everything 
was not healthy in our economy ryzhkov told 33 female journalists 
gathered in st catherines hall of the grand kremlin palace on the 
eve of international womens day 
ryzkhovs frank remarks touched on details of his personal life 
and frustration with the slow pace of reform 
he promised to reveal the longsecret soviet defense budget in 12 
to 18 months after accountants have arranged it in a form 
comparable to us figures apparently for use in arms negotiations 
as part of the plan to shift soviet spending from swords to 
plowshares defense factories that produce 60 percent military 
hardware and 40 percent consumer goods will move to a 5050 ratio by 
1991 and 4060 by 1995 he said 
for example the moscow aviation factory soon will produce pasta 
he said 
ryzhkov said he found the slow pace of economic reform the most 
upsetting part of his job 
i like to see how the decisions we are taking in the state 
bodies are implemented in the level of real life he said that is 
why he enjoys visiting factories that remind him of the ural 
machinebuilding plant in sverdlovsk where his career began to 
feel the smell of machine parts being manufactured the smell of 
real work he said 
ryzhkov blamed part of the countrys problems on corrupt 
bureaucrats he also said 40 percent of factory equipment must be 
replaced 
we have to make certain investments we have to have knowhow 
and we have to have time for that he said 
the premier also tackled the notorious shortage of laundry soap 
in moscow we used to sell 80 tons of detergent daily now we 
sell 300 tons daily and still we have lines for detergent then 
he quipped i dont believe the overall washing has increased all 
that much 
he suggested that journalists created a selffulfilling prophecy 
by publicizing a soap shortage until people began hoarding even more 
to eliminate shortages he said wages must stop rising faster 
than retail trade and productivity 
in an unusual discussion of his personal life ryzhkov said he 
answers his own phone in a 13hour to 14hour workday and continues 
work at home as a result he misses the theater and concerts 
the 59yearold premier said his wife ludmila is a mechanical 
engineer who designed excavators at the same factory where he rose 
to director 
he said she reads extensively on the countries they visit and 
works on behalf of orphans 
ryzhkov said his daughter is a law professor at the academy of 
the interior ministry and her husband also is a lawyer in the 
customs office they have two children ludmila 2 and nikolai 6 
women already hold 25 percent of the management jobs in the 
soviet union and this should expand under perestroika ryzhkov said 
until now administrative methods were more suited to a man 
with a loud voice he said now we have to control the economy 
not with a shout but with an intellect and that will allow women to 
have their say

three new cars a used car three pairs of 
shoes a pair of pants and half a racehorse were about all jake 
malham had time to buy with 1 million in florida lottery winnings 
before he died of a heart attack 
malham a liquor store and lounge owner who died monday at age 53 
of an apparent heart attack became the first georgian to win big 
money in floridas lottery friends said tuesday he died a happy man 
all that money didnt change jake said rb spriggs a 
friend of malhams for 30 years it probably relieved him more 
than anything else of financial pressures 
if anything spriggs said the money only made a nice guy nicer 
after he won the jan 12 drawing he bought new cars for himself 
his mother and his girlfriend joann williamson ms williamson said 
he bought a used car for his brother and the pants and shoes for 
himself 
after that he was the same old jake she said 
malham paid off the debts on his property and gave 1000 each to 
six employees at first state bank and trusts branch in valdosta 
friends said he had told the employees hed give them a share if he 
ever hit the lottery 
but jim griffin another longtime friend said i think the one 
thing he was most proud of was that he had paid off everything he 
owed 
even after malham won the scratch three lottery contest he 
continued to open his liquor store at 8 am each day and still 
lived in the same mobile home 
recently malham and spriggs traveled to henderson ky to watch 
the running of a horse in which they both owned shares the horse 
cash not silver won its heat spriggs said and the overjoyed 
malham was showing off his trophy at his liquor store the morning of 
his death 
his body was found in his mobile home that afternoon 
spriggs said malham changed so little that when they traveled 
together to the dog races in jacksonville fla and the horse races 
in tampa fla bills were split 5050 just as if his pal didnt 
have a fortune 
that was fine with me i didnt want anything from him and he 
knew that spriggs said 
malham had told spriggs that of the 800000 he had cleared after 
taxes he had invested about 600000 of it in highyield 
certificates of deposit so he wasnt blowing this money he knew 
what he was doing 
spriggs and ms williamson said malham had battled health 
problems for much of his life but they didnt think the excitement 
of winning the lottery contributed to his death 
the only time i really worried about his health is when he won 
it the lottery i made him sit down he was so excited spriggs

despite warnings from the united 
states the government continued to give sensitive defense contracts 
to a munich company after libya bought control of the firm a news 
report says 
libya bought controlling interest in the telemit electronic co 
in 1979 norddeutsche rundfunks panorama television magazine 
reported tuesday 
it said the company specializes in the development of 
sophisticated military intelligence and communications equipment 
including a laser system to measure military target distances 
the company helped outfit libyas intelligence network in the 
1970s the report said 
west germanys defense ministry continued to give military 
contracts to telemit even after it knew that libya had taken over 
majority control of the company the program alleged 
the contracts included electronic equipment for west germanys 
leopard tank it said 
the government also allowed the company to deliver sophisticated 
electronic gear to both iran and iraq during the persian gulf war 
panorama said 
panorama said the united states expressed its concern over the 
west germanlibyan connection in the early 1980s but the 
government ignored concerns that libya could gain access to 
sensitive government projects through its association with the 
company the program said 
it said the company was protected by west german intelligence 
agencies which used it to gain information about developments in 
the middle east 
winfried dunkel a spokesman for the defense ministry told the 
program that military contracts have been suspended until the 
company is restructured to return it to complete west german control 
he acknowledged that the company is owned by several holding 
companies controlled by libya 
dunkel said the company had been given military contracts for 
years but said none of the contracts involved secret or highly 
sensitive technology 
he said the defense ministry in the mid1980s demanded that the 
company ensure that no influence could be made by the holding 
companies on the firms management 
but he said the recent allegations that west german companies had 
been involved in the building of an alleged poison gas factory in 
libya had prompted the ministry to order the contract suspensions 
the bonn government was slow in acknowledging and launching 
investigations into those allegations which the us government had 
pressed through news media disclosures at the beginning of the year 
horst jungmann a member of the opposition social democratic 
party in federal parliament told panorama of telemit electronics 
the government has known for a long time that the company is 
100 percent owned by libya it has received technical knowhow from 
the military that could have been sent on to libya

strikebound eastern airlines is rapidly draining 
its cash reserves and soon may have to seek bankruptcy protection 
auction off its assets or most likely sell itself to the highest 
bidder analysts say 
the possibility of eastern filing under chapter 11 of federal 
bankruptcy laws was heightened tuesday when the airline said it 
couldnt last until the weekend without its 3600 pilots most of 
whom have refused to cross the picket lines of the striking 
machinists union 
eastern is quickly bleeding the 400 million in cash it had on 
hand at the beginning of the year and faces large debt payments 
that could force it to seek protection from its creditors analysts 
said 
theyre not forced to declare bankruptcy but they can also see 
those payments looming in the horizon said bill swelbar director 
of industry analysis for airline economics inc 
the option that analysts see as most likely however would be an 
outright sale of the 60yearold carrier carl icahns trans world 
airlines already has discussed buying eastern 
analysts place a purchase price anywhere from 400 million plus 
debt payments to 900 million for ailing eastern which lost 3354 
million last year nearly double its 1987 loss 
analysts doubt that frank lorenzo chairman of easterns parent 
company texas air corp planned to thrust eastern into bankruptcy 
when the machinists strike began saturday lorenzo used bankruptcy 
filing as a way to break the union contracts at continental airlines 
after texas air bought that airline in 1983 
i think the game plan was to force this thing to a showdown and 
hopefully get the pilots across the picket line basically undoing 
the machinists said louis marckesano an analyst with janney 
montgomery scott inc of philadelphia 
but the pilots decision to honor the strike may have thrown a 
wrench into lorenzos strategy a federal judge tuesday refused to 
order the pilots back into the cockpit 
most of easterns cash an estimated 350 million represents 
money that customers paid in advance for tickets that now must be 
refunded or transfered to competitors that honor the tickets the 
money will dwindle within several weeks according to analysts 
with limited flights eastern which did about 10 million in 
daily business before the strike has few advance bookings and no 
revenue so it must drain cash reserves to pay wages overhead and 
debt 
eastern could get a cash transfusion from the pending 365 
million sale of its profitable northeast shuttle one of two 
eastern operations still running to new york developer donald 
trump eastern says the strike has not affected the deal which 
awaits final federal approval 
repayment of debt associated with the sale and a required pension 
fund payment would leave eastern with about 210 million 
if they dont get the proceeds from the shuttle i would say 
theyd have to declare bankruptcy by the end of the month said 
philip baggaley an airline bond analyst for standard amp poors 
corp a major wall street creditrating agency 
if they do they could probably survive another month or two 
and try to sell more operations and more assets he said but 
the prospects arent good no matter what happens 
despite shutting down most of its operations and laying off 9500 
nonunion workers this week analysts estimate eastern has an 
operating cash loss of at least 2 million a day for payments 
ranging from leasing airport ticket counters to paying 1500 
remaining employees 
but should lorenzo file for protection he would have a tougher 
time abrogating the unions contracts than he did at continental as 
a result of 1985 amendments to the bankruptcy laws lorenzo first 
would have to negotiate further with the eastern unions and 
demonstrate that he had no alternative before firing the workers 
another option would be for eastern to auction its planes 
airport gates routes and landing rights to other airlines in a 
liquidation under chapter 7 of federal bankruptcy laws

suspected tamil separatists killed a 
moderate tamil politician in eastern sri lanka today just one day 
before he was to take his seat in parliament authorities said 
in the capital suspected antigovernment radicals burst into a 
research laboratory and shot and killed the former vice chancellor 
of colombo university police said 
v samkpanthamurthy was walking to the rice paddies near his home 
in the village of kakudha when he was gunned down by two men on a 
motorcycle the military said kakudha is about 135 miles east of 
colombo 
the military blamed his killing on the liberation tigers of tamil 
eelam the biggest and most militant tamil group waging a nearly 
6yearold insurgency for a separate nation 
samkpanthamurthy a leading member of the moderate tamil united 
liberation front was chosen to take one of the 10 parliament seats 
won by the party during the feb 15 general election 
the governing united national party will control 125 of the 225 
seats 
in the capital four men burst into the college house across from 
colombo university and fatally shot professor stanly wijesundera 
police said 
the 65yearold professor of biochemistry had served as 
vicechancellor of the university for more than 11 years 
wijesundera retired four months ago and had been working on a 
research project university officials said 
police blamed sinhalese radicals for the killing 
they said the professors slaying may have been to protest plans 
by president ranasinghe premadasas government to reopen seven 
universities that were closed over the last two years because of 
student unrest 
government officials have said the unrest was fueled by militants 
of the ethnic sinhalese majority who oppose government efforts to 
grant minority tamils greater autonomy 
the only university currently operating is in the northern town 
of jaffna 
the government earlier announced that the seven universities 
would reopen on march 2 but postponed the date without giving any 
reason 
the students have been protesting the detention of colleagues who 
had opposed an indiasponsored 1987 peace accord aimed at the tamil 
insurgency in the islands north and east provinces 
sinhalese radicals said the accord grants too many concessions to 
the tamils who make up 18 percent of the countrys 16 million 
people 
they say they are denied jobs education and money for 
development by the sinhalese who are predominantly buddhist make 
up 75 percent of the population and control the government and 
military 
tamils who are mostly hindu are a majority in the north and 
east and militant tamils have been demanding an independent 
homeland in those provinces

down the resolution cited the recent film the thin blue line 
which suggests that an innocent man faced the death penalty in texas 
two years ago about 30 towns took up the question and 
twothirds voted for reinstatement 
but most town meeting debates were over local issues residents 
in the central vermont town of plainfield applauded their town road 
crew but residents in neighboring marshfield lost patience when 
people couldnt agree on whether to replace an old bridge 
pointing a crooked finger at a longwinded neighbor russell p 
goslant said why keep arguing over a damn old bridge why 
keep arguing over something that dont amount to nothing 
when goslant spoke at midafternoon the town was averaging an 
hour to debate each article on the 27article warning

defeated democratic assemblyman richard brodsky in a 30minute game 
of oneonone basketball 
tuesdays game which cuomo won 1812 had symbolic import for 
brodsky the only announced democratic candidate in this years 
westchester county executive election the republican incumbent 
andrew orourke challenged cuomo and lost in the 1986 gubernatorial

police found guns and plastic explosives hidden in 
a forest near a building where prime minister margaret thatcher is 
to address a conservative party conference next week authorities 
said 
the weapons were found near the northeast england village of 
scalby about two miles from scarborough where the governing 
conservatives are to gather 
mrs thatcher survived an ira bomb attack on oct 12 1984 that 
killed five people during the conservatives annual convention at 
the coast resort of brighton the blast partly demolished the hotel 
in which she was staying 
north yorkshire police who are responsible for the scarborough 
area said they saw no reason to recommend cancellation of the march 
1718 conference of the conservatives national council at 
scarboroughs spa conference center 
the deputy chief constable of north yorkshire frank morritt 
told a news conference on tuesday that he could not discount a link 
between the arms cache and mrs thatchers planned visit to 
scarborough 
police said the cache of guns ammunition and czechoslovakmade 
semtex explosive was found monday in a forest clearing beside a 
road it was unearthed by accident by a man gathering leaf mold for 
his garden police said 
police did not reveal how many weapons were found but said the 
amount of semtex was substantial the london newspaper the daily 
telegraph said 25 pounds of the plastic explosive was found 
army bomb disposal experts say semtex is frequently used in ira 
bombs 
the british government has repeatedly accused libyan leader col 
moammar gadhafi of supplying the ira with arms and semtex in 
retaliation for mrs thatchers backing of us bombing raids 
against libya in april 1986 
she gave permission for us warplanes to fly from british bases 
to take part in the attack 
gadhafi vowed unspecified revenge against britain shortly after 
the raids he has frequently expressed support for the ira which is 
fighting to end british rule in northern ireland 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to unite predominantly 
protestant northern ireland with the republic of ireland 
morrit on tuesday called on owners of hotels and guest houses in 
the scarborough area to tell police about any recent visitors who 
had given cause for concern 
also tuesday masked gunmen killed three men at a village gas 
station in the northern ireland town of coagh 50 miles west of 
belfast 
the irish republican army claimed responsibility in a statement 
to the local news media and said the service station was a 
stronghold of the ulster volunteer force a protestant paramilitary 
group that also is banned 
police said the three men slain in coagh who were chatting when 
the gunment drove up and opened fire had no connection with 
northern irelands security forces

doctors who treated transplant patient donna 
ashlock whose story touched millions after she received the heart 
of a boy who had a crush on her were stunned by her death 
donna was three weeks from her 18th birthday and was waiting for 
a second transplant when she died tuesday at her home in patterson 
donna who recently said she wanted to become a nurse died 
during a midday nap according to san franciscos pacific 
presbyterian medical center 
she had received the heart of 15yearold felipe garza jr three 
years ago at the medical center 
although the transplant initially was a success her body last 
year began to reject felipes heart which he willed to his ailing 
friend before a blood vessel in his brain burst and he died suddenly 
dr andrew fryer her pediatric cardiologist said she was in 
pretty good shape when doctors examined her last week 
she was a wonderful little girl and her death shocks and 
saddens us all fryer told reporters we truly admired her 
resiliency and ability to cope with things that young girls 
shouldnt have to cope with 
dr michael schorr her family physician and others praised her 
cheerfulness courage and attempts to live the life of a normal 
teenager during her nearly fouryear battle for life 
she had been through a lot of stress and discomfort physically 
and emotionally she really kept her spirits up remarkably well 
schorr said 
although there was no official determination of the cause of 
death doctors suspected cardiac arrythmia the irregular beating of 
the heart a problem often found in transplant patients 
her chances would have been excellent with another transplant 
fryer said 
donnas parents declined to talk with reporters 
their daughter was thrust into the limelight when it was reported 
that felipe who once had a crush on his high school classmate told 
his parents he wanted to leave the ailing 14yearold girl his heart

researchers have developed a vaccine to 
protect monkeys against infection by a virus that is a distant 
relative of the aids virus according to a report published today 
at least three more years of research are needed before the 
vaccine can be tested on humans but scientists say the finding 
could help in the search for an aids vaccine the los angeles times 
reported 
i think it is going to be a source of great excitement in the 
neurological and virological communities said steven j greenberg 
of the national cancer institute in bethesda md 
the vaccine developed at ohio state university protected a 
group of macaque monkeys against a virus called htlv1 which causes 
a rare form of leukemia and has been linked to other diseases 
htlv1 is a member of an unusual family of viruses called 
retroviruses which include the aids virus 
insights gained in the monkey research may show scientists which 
components of the aids virus must be present in a vaccine said ohio 
state pathobiologist richard g olsen 
the htlv1 virus discovered in the early 1980s by virologist 
robert c gallo of the national cancer institute causes adult 
tcell leukemia and lymphoma and has been linked to multiple 
sclerosis systemic lupus erythematosus and other rare neurological 
conditions 
the virus is spread by the exchange of bodily fluids in the same 
manner as the aids virus infection by the htlv1 virus is endemic 
among intravenous drug users in some eastern urban areas 
the olsen group developed the virus by building on information 
learned in the successful search for a virus to protect house cats 
against infection by a retrovirus that causes feline leukemia the 
no 1 killer of domestic cats 
neither the cat nor monkey vaccines contain the virus itself but 
parts of proteins secreted by animal cells that were infected with 
the virus 
olsen said that the protein finding was important in aids 
research because most potential aids vaccines being developed only 
use one type of protein and thus probably will be less effective 
more than one protein is going to be necessary for an aids 
vaccine he said 
some of olsens vaccinated monkeys have gone as long as two years 
without showing any traces of infection but greenberg and other 
scientists note that the htlv1 virus can remain hidden for two to 
four decades before triggering an infection 
olsen who reported his findings at a recent meeting on 
retroviruses is studying the longterm impact of the vaccine by 
using sophisticated genetic engineering techniques to search for 
traces of infection in vaccinated monkeys

run for your wife gives american 
theatergoers a chance to see an authentic production of a british 
sex farce without having to cross the atlantic 
whether they would want to is another question entirely the 
play which opened tuesday at broadways virginia theater is full 
of leers lunges and lame sex jokes it could bring back celibacy 
run for your wife stars ray cooney who also wrote and 
directed he strikes out on all three counts in londons west end 
cooney is sort of a oneman play industry his other successful 
efforts there include such supposedly spicy concoctions as not 
now darling move over mrs markham why not stay for 
breakfast and two into one the titles are better than the 
plays 
the plot of run for your wife spins out of control early 
john smith played by cooney is a london taxi cab driver he has 
one wife mary in wimbledon and another barbara in streatham 
both of their tacky apartments by set supervisor michael anania 
are on stage simultaneously you can tell them apart because one is 
blue the other yellow his wives are colorcoded to match the 
apartments one wears blue the other yellow thats the extent of 
their characterizations 
when smith saves a little old lady from a mugging and gets beaten 
up his twin living arrangements unravel most of the evening is 
spent trying to prevent one wife from finding out about the other 
with one glorious exception the acting is cardboard flat and 
gray only paxton whitehead as a wellmeaning but bumbling 
neighbor manages to rise above the drivel he actually seems to 
believe what he is saying thats no small accomplishment 
considering cooneys inane dialogue 
the second act trades boring for offensive it bashes homosexuals 
with some crude jokes primarily focused on one limpwristed 
character who wears a lavender jumpsuit in case you cant figure out 
his sexual preference 
the play has none of the style or wit of lend me a tenor 
another farce which arrived last week in fact it makes that 
harmless trifle seem like noel coward 
run for your wife is one of londons biggest hits it has 
clocked more than 2500 performances and shows no sign of slowing 
down in new york it should expire quickly 
in other reviews mel gussow wrote in the new york times 
accepting the ground rules for allowable contrivances in farce 
the play is still burdened with blind alleys limp jokes forced 
puns and troubled entendres 
run for your wife is what is known in the trade as an 
audience show wrote howard kissel in the daily news what this 
means is that it is so witless and inane that no selfrespecting 
critic can possibly endorse it but audiences enjoy it 
tremendously 
the premises of the joke are ramshackle its convolutions 
arbitrary and its conclusion quite remarkably inconclusive wrote 
clive barnes in the new york post the results are shabby with 
the actors busting a gut for laughs rather like a tv sitcom going 
down for the third time without a script

a man who said he contracted aids from blood 
products during heart surgery in 1985 will collect the largest 
settlement for anyone who has contracted the deadly syndrome his 
attorney said 
attorney robert l habush said monday that his client john 
carroll avoided an appeals battle over a 39 million jury award 
because of the settlement 
the amount was not disclosed but habush said it was very 
favorable and still very much a record in dollars in aids cases 
the largest previous award is believed to be 16 millon for an 
atlanta man who contracted aids from a blood product that promotes 
clotting that verdict was later overturned on grounds the evidence 
was insufficient to prove negligence by the laboratory that provided 
the product 
a san francisco jury in december awarded 750000 to the family 
of a 5yearold who contracted the virus from blood he received 
during a heart operation in 1983 
and in february a california jury awarded rock hudsons lover 
marc christian 2175 million because hudson failed to tell him he 
had aids the case increased the responsibility of aids sufferers to 
tell sexual companions of their plight 
carroll wanted his case resolved quickly so that he could decide 
how the money would be used including what charities he would 
support before he died the 63yearold man testified during the 
trial that he expected to live no more than one year 
a circuit court jury had awarded the suburban brookfield man 39 
million in damages in december but attorneys said appeals could 
have taken years 
the man had filed suit against the blood center of southeastern 
wisconsin which provided blood products used during his operation 
john dawson the blood centers lawyer said the case was settled 
to both sides satisfaction 
the blood center remains confident that it was not negligent 
and that there was no liability in this case at all he said 
the plaintiff argued the center was negligent for distributing 
blood products that werent tested for the aids virus even though it 
had tested products on hand 
the blood centers attorneys said that at the time they could 
not be sure of the reliability of aids tests and were reluctant to 
replace untested blood with tested blood 
the plaintiff received the blood april 23 1985 six weeks after 
the blood center began testing blood for the aids virus 
aids or acquired immune deficiency syndrome breaks down the 
bodys immune system and leaves the victim open to outbreaks of 
other diseases no cure is known it is spread through sexual 
contact transfusions of blood and blood products and the sharing 
of contamined hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers

a man convicted of being the ski mask 
rapist in the sexual assaults of 26 women is virtually assured of 
spending the rest of his life in prison a prosecutor said 
anthony sanchez a 27yearold former city sewer worker was 
found guilty tuesday of 117 of 136 charges stemming from the 
assaults 
if i just look at the violent sexual offenses i can see that 
hes looking at more than 500 years in prison prosecutor margo 
smith said disregarding appeals sanchez would have to serve at 
least half his sentence before being eligible for parole 
we have a number of victims here who were greatly traumatized 
there can be no doubt justice has been done smith said 
superior court judge paul r teilh set sentencing for april 25 
teilh said he had carefully reviewed preliminary hearing 
transcripts and found no doubt that sanchez was guilty of most of 
the counts filed against him 
sanchez agreed friday to let the judge declare a verdict based on 
the transcripts which included testimony from the victims teilh 
dismissed 19 charges 
police reports said sanchez usually stalked his victims before 
accosting them and often tied them up sexually assaulting them 
then taking cash jewelry or automatic bankteller cards the rapes 
occurred in both homes and offices and one woman was attacked in a 
church confessional 
the assailant usually wore a ski mask and often threatened his 
victims with a knife or pellet gun that closely resembled a 
45caliber pistol 
ive killed before and ill kill again he warned them 
according to the police reports 
when sanchez was arrested dec 16 1987 police discovered a ski 
mask a black pellet gun and a hooded sweat shirt in his car 
several victims said their assailant had worn such a mask and shirt 
the charges against sanchez involved attacks from 1985 to 1987 on 
santa clara county women ranging in age from 16 to 84 
teilh found sanchez guilty on 22 counts each of rape burglary 
and robbery 
he also found sanchez guilty of 23 oral copulation charges six 
assaults with intent to commit rape 17 sexual batteries four 
instances of sodomy and one count of penetration with a foreign

the john birch society plans to move its 
headquarters to this northeastern wisconsin town but mayor dorothy 
johnson said she doubts it will give the community an image problem 
appleton already is known for its links to the late sen joseph 
mccarthy annual memorial services are held at his gravesite in 
town and a large bust of him is in the outagamie county courthouse 
the town also holds the annual harry houdini seance in honor of the 
famed magician who grew up in town 
that says our city has a variety of ideas and isnt it 
wonderful we can permit within our social network the whole range of 
ideas ms johnson said 
the conservative organization will close its headquarters in 
belmont mass and san marino calif and consolidate operations 
in appleton beginning in july the group said in the march issue of 
the john birch society bulletin 
its a real opportunity here in terms of potential growth and 
the economic impact of it all said g allen bubolz an appleton 
insurance executive who became the societys chief executive officer 
in november 
the headquarters will start with a staff of 27 people and a 
payroll of roughly 1 million bubolz said 
the society said appleton also was nearer the geographical center 
of the united states and noted its connections to mccarthy the 
republican senator who chaired hearings into alleged communist 
activities in the united states in the 1950s mccarthy who was 
later censured by his colleagues was born in nearby grand chute 
the society is a conservative political organization that 
emphasizes fighting the spread of communism and reducing the size of 
us government it claims more than 10000 members 
city attorney greg carman didnt share the mayors views saying 
the move was unfortunate for the community but he said he would not 
advocate any attempt to prevent it 
carman said he feared that the mccarthy bust the annual services 
for mccarthy and the birch society would present a false image of 
the people of appleton

jewish settlement today turning out a small group of israelis who 
pitched a tent on the hilltop site in an attempt to launch a new 
community 
the bid to create another jewish enclave in the west bank 
followed a rally attended by 10000 people in tel aviv whose 
organizers called for the founding of eight such settlements 
elswhere in the occupied lands today palestinians staged a 
general strike to mark the 15month anniversary of their uprising 
seven arabs were shot and wounded during clashes with troops in 
the gaza strip arab hospital officials said the army said it was 
checking the reports 
palestinian women staged proplo demonstrations in the west bank 
town of beit jalla and in gaza city to mark international womens 
day 
the latest leaflet issued by underground leaders of the uprising 
against israels 21year occupation praised women for their heroic 
role in the liberation war 
in east jerusalem police imposed a curfew on the arab isawiye 
section and rounded up men suspected of involvement in recent 
protests police said at least 15 palestinians were arrested 
israel radio said 
after tuesday nights rally in tel aviv a group of wouldbe 
settlers set out for the site of a proposed settlement called 
ofarim the site is about 15 miles east of tel aviv on land occupied 
by israel since it was captured from jordan in the 1967 middle east 
war 
the governments coalition agreement calls for setting up eight 
settlements but final approval has not been granted 
the finance ministry controlled by the leftcenter labor party 
says the country cannot afford the new settlements 
two army jeeps blocked the entrance to the ofarim site this 
morning 
a defense ministry official who demanded anonymity said eight 
activists from the rightwing betar youth movement had set up a tent 
at the site during the night but later left at the order of soldiers

nearly 50 jewish women across the soviet union 
began a threeday hunger strike today to protest what they say are 
arbitrary policies that bar their emigration a participant said 
it is the third year in a row that jewish women against refusal 
whose members have been denied exit visas have held a hunger strike 
beginning on international womens day a soviet holiday celebrated 
on march 8 
these three hunger strikes have all been during the years of 
perestroika everyone talks a lot about all the changes due to 
perestroika but the situation in emigration is still the same 
said hunger strike organizer inna ioffe who first applied for an 
exit visa 10 years ago perestroika is what president mikhail s 
gorbachev calls his reform program 
the women are protesting soviet emigration procedures and calling 
on soviet leaders to set up a judicial system to review their cases 
about half of the 46 women participating in the hunger strike 
have been refused emigration for reasons of state secrecy ioffe 
said soviet authorities have told them they cannot leave because 
they or their relatives have knowledge of state secrets she said 
the other half have been denied emigration because their parents 
or divorced spouses have failed to certify that they have no 
financial claims on the wouldbe emigrants she said 
women in moscow leningrad kiev minsk vilnius irkutsk and 
other cities were participating in the hunger strike ioffe said 
we have no laws to lean on and we are never given reasonable 
reasons for the refusals she said 
ioffe said she has been told she cannot emigrate because her 
76yearold motherinlaw who also wants to emigrate was exposed 
to state secrets in her work as a botanist 
more than 20000 soviet jews were allowed permission to emigrate 
in 1988 
yuri semenovsky who has sought in vain for three years to obtain 
a soviet exit visa said at a recent moscow demonstration of the 
socalled jewish refuseniks that 80000 others have had applications 
refused 
the majority of the women who participated in the 1988 and 1987 
hunger strikes have now emigrated said ioffe who also took part in 
those hunger strikes

aids is spreading at an alarming rate in the soviet 
union with the number of infected or ill people forecast to 
increase nearly tenfold next year the government daily izvestia 
says 
the newspaper quoted the health minister yevgeny chazov as 
saying aids now poses no less a danger to the soviet union than 
nuclear weapons 
the alarming situation with aids demands rapid and decisive 
measures izvestia said tuesday night in the latest of a series of 
reports in the soviet press expressing growing concern about the 
deadly disease 
the soviets once claimed acquired immune deficiency syndrome was 
strictly a western problem caused by decadent capitalist sexual 
mores and drug use homosexuals and intravenous drug users are two 
of the groups at greatest risk 
soviet papers once even claimed aids was the result of a pentagon 
experiment in biological warfare 
soviet scientists since have debunked such claims saying their 
country needs to mobilize more resources to fight the spread of the 
disease which saps the bodys natural defenses and leaves it open 
to onslaught by other ailments 
according to izvestia however the aids virus is spreading at an 
alarming rate among soviets 
in 1988 the paper said 81 people in the soviet union were 
carriers of the aids virus by feb 1 it said 44 more cases were 
known and now the total number of people infected with the virus is 
more than 140 
its expected that next year there will be 1342 sick 
people izvestia said apparently referring to carriers of the 
virus rather than people actually suffering symptoms 
of four soviets actually suffering aids symptoms three have died 
to date izvestia said 
the government newspaper reporting on a meeting of a special 
soviet commission created to fight epidemics quoted chazov as 
saying warnings to the kremlin that aids could become a national 
calamity had been ignored 
the threat that we face is no less than the ecological bomb 
or nuclear weapons izvestia quoted chazov as saying 
he also stated that workers of the ussr ministry of health 
on numerous occasions tried to inform the government that the 
situation was menacing but noted scientists dealing with the 
problem eliminated the acuteness of the question saying it was all 
a false alarm 
the united states had 86157 aids victims as of last month 
according to the world health organization

direct action against hunger and the other half for work for peace 
weizsaecker a protestant layman and the brother of west german 
president richard von weizsaecker said his share would go to 
deepening relationships between science and faith 
the winners were announced at a news conference at the church 
center for the united nations by john templeton american investment

stanley l jaki an astrophysicist at seton hall university in new 
jersey won two years ago

delayed after some jewish leaders alleged he had links to 
antisemitism 
but the award subsequently was made after an inquiry found the 
criticisms unjustified

us treasury secretary william simon roman catholic archishop mark 
mcgrath of panama and british foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe 
macleod a church of scotland clergyman left a wealthy parish to

about 100000 visit there annually to experience its methods 
firsthand as a model for religious renewal peace and christian 
unity 
macleod who had become a pacifist after witnessing the slaughter 
of world war i as a military captain also founded an early peace 
organization the fellowship of reconciliation which now has 
branches in most countries 
he stepped down in 1967 as leader of the iona community which 
has about 200 resident members and thousands of supporter elsewhere

schedule of teaching 
weizsaecker was cited as pioneering the development of the 
interrelationships of physics cosmology and theology and laying 
the groundwork for the renewal of faith 
an astrophysicist his research into cosmology led him after 
world war ii to initiate conversations between scientists and 
theologians originally in 1949 at the university of gottingen in 
germany and later elsewhere

america resulting in an international conference in 1978 on science 
and faith sponsored by the world council of churches at the 
massachusetts institute of technology 
weizsaecker who has written about 40 books on physics 
astronomy cosmology and religion has taught at universities of

the supreme court ruled today that spectators may 
take notes during most trials and an american lawyer who brought 
the case said the decision would help open the japanese legal system 
to needed reform 
until todays ruling only reporters for major newspapers and 
radio and television stations were allowed to take notes during most 
trials 
the decision came in a case brought by lawrence repeta a seattle 
attorney denied permission to take notes at a tax trial in 198384 
although it ruled in his favor the court said repetas inability to 
take notes during the trial was not serious enough to warrant paying 
the 10000 damages he demanded 
while attending the tax trial as part of research for a book on 
japanese law repeta 38 was repeatedly refused permission to take 
notes with support from the japanese civil liberties union he 
lodged a complaint which was rejected by tokyo district court and 
tokyo high court 
as of today anyone can go into any courtroom in japan and will 
be allowed to take notes repeta said today 
in a democracy people have to have free access to the courts 
or they cant be satisfied that the criminal process is being used 
fairly 
repeta told reporters there were very serious violations of 
fundamental human rights principles in japanese criminal trials 
including the holding of suspects for long periods without bail and 
without access to a lawyer in the tax case repeta observed the 
defendant was held for 2 years without bail 
the best remedy for such problems is public knowledge of what 
goes on in the courtroom he said 
in a rare appearance by a foreigner before the supreme court 
repeta told the judges in a january hearing that japan now has a 
responsibility to set an international legal example 
the world looks to japan to take a leadership role not only in 
economics but also in the cultural and political fields he said 
about 30 japanese supported repeta in the case including 
lawyers reporters and writers 
his japanese lawyer yoichi kitamura said it took an american to 
bring the case because japanese are accustomed to the fact that 
spectators are not allowed to take notes 
in japans controversial press club system most government 
agencies maintain semiofficial press clubs that generally exclude 
reporters from small newspapers and magazines and foreign 
correspondents 
until todays ruling only members of judiciary press clubs were 
allowed to take notes during most trials members of press clubs 
still do not have access to court documents

police dragged people from their homes in 
lhasa the tibetan capital today as troops converged on the city to 
enforce martial law after three days of antichinese rioting 
witnesses said 
foreigners were given a day to leave the remote southern city 
an australian traveler told of security forces in lhasa pulling 
tibetans out of their homes one or two people were screaming 
really frantically as they were being taken away into a truck 
the truck kept coming back he said they would pick up a 
couple people drive off with a half dozen militia holding them 
down then come back 
the australian speaking by telephone said he saw police leading 
away another group of 12 to 14 youths some of whom looked as young 
as nine 
an american tourist said thousands of soldiers occupied the old 
section of the city where tibetans protesting chinese rule began 
rioting sunday stoning police and building bonfires of goods looted 
from chineseowned stores 
official reports have put the death toll in the violence at 12 
although tibetans say far more have been killed most shot to death 
by security frces 
at midnight tuesday trucks with loudspeakers began announcing 
the city was under martial law and that tibetans should stay indoors 
dozens of trucks packed with soldiers later entered the city 
chinese authorities said the entire city would be cordoned 
off anyone who defies martial law or instigates others to do so 
will be severely punished the official xinhua news agency 
reported 
it was the first time china has publicly imposed martial law 
anywhere since the 196676 cultural revolution it marked an 
escalation in the battle with tibetan protesters who demand freedom 
from china and the return of their spiritual leader the dalai lama 
who fled to exile in india after a filed uprising 30 years ago 
in new delhi the dalai lamas governmentinexile today offered 
to hold talks in geneva with chinese authorities to discuss tibets 
future 
despite the current tragic events we are still ready to hold 
talks with the chinese so that a peaceful solution can be found 
said tashi wongdi the tibetan leaders chief representative in new 
delhi 
the two sides have agreed to meet to discuss the tibetan 
situation but have been unable to agree on a location china also 
refuses to discuss the dalai lamas proposal for greater autonomy 
for tibet 
troops were not deployed in three previous outbreaks of violence 
over the past 18 months that claimed the lives of about 40 tibetans 
and police 
one american said that after martial law was declared the 
tibetans whod been marching around were still angry they felt 
frustrated others were scared i saw grown men bursting into 
tears 
doje cering head of the tibet autonomous government was quoted 
on national radio today as saying separatists had taken chinas 
restrained stance toward past demonstrations as a sign of weakness 
now is the time for a radical solution if we dont adopt that 
now it will seriously influence our social stability 
travelers said police entered one hotel at 230 am and another 
an hour later and announced that all foreigners must leave lhasa by 
noon thursday about 80 foreigners were believed to be in the city 
its basically a choice between heading for the nepal border 
and flying to chengdu the provincial capital of sichuan one 
traveler said but they wont let us out to go to the bank or 
prepare 
one american traveler said most of the tibetans wounded in the 
clashes have been hiding in their homes its presumed that 
anybody who got shot must be guilty he said 
foreigners said security forces were checking identifications of 
both the few tibetans and chinese out on the streets there were no 
reports of demonstrations or gunfire today 
all foreigners spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of 
reprisal 
three swedes who took photographs of sundays initial clash in 
the central square were given back their cameras and passports 
tuesday after paying fines of about 54 each an american who took 
more pictures was fined the equivalent of 135 a fellow american 
said 
however one swiss who refused to turn over his film sunday said 
police beat him and pointed a gun at his head he said police still 
have his camera and passport and say they will not return them until 
he hands over the film and pays a fine he said he was not injured 
china has not said how long martial law will be in effect 
although it is certain to last through friday the 30th anniversary 
of a failed uprising in 1959 that led to the dalai lamas exile

iran with help from china is building a 
plant to produce surfacetosurface missiles with a range of more 
than 500 miles western diplomatic sources said today 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity also said iran 
continues to develop materials to conduct chemical warfare 
they said the missile factory is in northeastern iran but they 
did not give the precise location its a missile plant and the 
chinese are lending support to build it that much is known one 
source said 
surfacetosurface missiles are used against land targets such as 
military installations and population centers 
although iran and china deny any arms deals us and other 
western officials say china has been a principal supplier of weapons 
for ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime 
the sales estimated by these experts at more than 1 billion 
have included two types of jet aircraft and the hy2 silkworm and 
c801 antiship missiles which have a range of less than 100 miles 
chinas deputy prime minister tian jiyun ended a fiveday trip 
to iran on tuesday according to tehran television monitored in 
cyprus it said the visit concentrated on trade and industrial ties 
and made no mention of weapons 
iran said a year ago it was building its own version of a 
foreign missile for use against iraq a unmediated ceasefire 
on aug 20 halted the eightyear war between iran and iraq 
iran has not given details on the missile it is building but 
western experts have said it would be relatively simple for the 
iranians to have copied sovietdesigned scudb rockets acquired 
from syria or libya 
chinas arsenal does not include a surfacetosurface missile 
with a 500 to 600mile range according to the authoritative 
reference janes weapons systems however the soviet union has 
produced a series of mobile landbased missiles including the ss12 
and its successor the ss22 each with a range of about 540 miles 
the soviets also are replacing the scudb with the ss23 a 300mile 
range missile 
during the iraniraq war the nations periodically bombarded each 
others population centers a practice that became known as the 
war of the cities 
baghdad iraqs capital is only 60 miles from the border and 
originally gave iran a strong advantage but the war of the 
cities reached unprecedented intensity last year when iraq began 
using longrange missiles to batter tehran and other areas of iran 
previously beyond range 
some analysts have said iraqs use of the missiles soviet 
scudbs with socalled strapon boosters to increase their 
160mile range was a key factor in forcing iran to agree to the 
ceasefire 
the diplomatic sources said iraq and iran were known to be 
continuing the development of chemical weapons 
iraq admitted to the use of poison gas against iranian forces and 
kurdish rebels during the war and a united nations report in april 
said there was evidence that iran also had used gas 
iran says it has the ability to manufacture chemical weapons but 
that it has neither produced nor used them in the war

favorite teachers but they wont be able to buy them in the school 
cafeteria officials have decided in reaction to reports of possible 
health risks 
the board of education which feeds students in 1200 public and 
parochial schools has barred the sale of apples in lunchrooms over 
fears that they are treated with a cancercausing pesticide new 
york newsday reported today 
we have conflicting information a highranking board 
official who asked to remain anonymous told newsday the apple 
processors say they dont use the pesticide alar the media says 
they do 
in the meantime to maintain a high confidence level we took 
them off the market the official said apple juice and sauce 
however are still being served 
last year 13 million apples were sold or distributed to public 
and parochial school students in new york city 
the washingtonbased national resources defense council last week 
reported that the pesticide diaminozide which is sold under the 
brand name alar could increase the incidence of cancer in children 
who drink a lot of apple juice 
apple growers have reacted angrily saying only about 4 percent 
of all apples sold in the united states show any traces of alar and 
those amounts are well below levels permitted by the federal 
environmental protection agency 
alar is used to maintain firmness and resist bruising in fruits 
and vegetables

operators shut down one of the two 
reactors at the mcguire nuclear power plant near charlotte after a 
leak caused a small amount of radioactive steam to be released into 
the air officials said today 
there was no danger to the public or employees but plant 
officials declared an alert at 1145 pm tuesday said duke power 
co which owns the plant 
an alert is the us nuclear regulatory commissions secondleast 
serious of four emergency categories it means that an event has 
occurred that could potentially affect the safety of the plant 
the average person should not have cause for concern duke 
spokesman mike mullen said the unit was shut down safely and the 
unit right next to it is continuing to supply power to our customers 
on a cold morning we will continue to keep the publics health and 
safety at the top of our concerns 
utility officials could not provide any measurement of the steam 
leak but mullen said the radioactive material released was within 
the conservative operating specifications of the plant 
mullen said the leak occurred in one or more of the 4600 small 
tubes that each of the plants eight generators has to receive 
superheated water from the reactor core the heat boils 
uncontaminated water to create steam which runs turbines that 
generate electricity in a secondary unit separate from the 
containment building where the reactor is located 
one or more of these tubes developed a leak he said its 
not uncommon for this to occur and to have the potential for the 
water in the secondary unit to become contaminated 
this is one of those events our operators are trained to deal 
with on simulators he said this was a textbook example of how 
to react 
mullen said it was too soon to predict the cost of repairs which 
could take weeks 
this will require cleaning up the secondary side where the 
contamination occurred he said we also will have to repair the 
tubes 
al warlick spokesman for the state department of crime control 
and public safety said an emergency response team was assembled in 
raleigh to monitor plant conditions

that resulted from the efforts of a woman who went undercover to 
help her daughters get off drugs 
jimmy ray goddard 55 of dallas and thomas reed wilson 53 of 
independence pleaded guilty tuesday in polk county circuit court to 
charges of criminal conspiracy to manufacture methamphetamine 
sentencing was set for april 17

infiltrated the group that allegedly supplied her daughters with 
methamphetamine 
police credited morrison a 44yearold bartender with helping 
break a major methamphetamine operation she often wore a hidden 
microphone during visits to the farm where the group lived 
the arrests came after police accompanied her to a state park 
west of salem where she had arranged to sell chemicals to a suspect

24 and 21 used methamphetamine and had been virtually living out of 
their cars

more than 5000 young people marched 
peacefully today to mark the anniversary of 1968 police beatings of 
students and to celebrate a government promise to legalize a banned 
student group 
about 3000 students at jagiellonian university in the southern 
city of krakow also rallied to support the group the independent 
students association 
those students heeding an appeal from the university rector did 
not leave campus and risk a confrontation with police in february 
a series of marches in krakow resulted in stonethrowing clashes 
with police 
in an unusual move tuesday warsaw officials granted permission 
for the march in their city the decision coincided with an 
agreement at negotiations between solidarity leader lech walesa and 
government officials to restore legal status to the student 
association like solidarity the student group was banned following 
the december 1981 martiallaw crackdown 
the warsaw march started when about 1000 people walked two miles 
from the warsaw polytechnic institute to warsaw university where 
they joined about 4000 students and professors for a rally 
police halted traffic for the march led by a woman pushing twins 
in a baby carriage the marchers chanted no success without nzs 
the initials in polish for the student group 
after a wreathlaying ceremony at a campus plaque marking the 
1968 events the participants walked a few blocks off campus to a 
monument honoring the 19th century polish epic poet and patriot adam 
mickiewicz 
police and plainclothes communist party worker activists beat 
students on march 8 1968 following student protests against the 
closure of a performance of mickiewiczs patriotic play 
grandfathers 
the march events looked upon from a perspective of 21 years 
make us aware of a certain great truth how pitifully ineffective 
are the efforts of all those who stand against the natural and 
inborn wish for freedom warsaw university rector grzegorz 
bialkowski told the students 
he told students to think about the history of the country and 
consider how the 1968 events contributed to current reform efforts 
in poland 
many of the students expelled for taking part in the 1968 protest 
became leaders of the solidarity trade union movement which began 
in 1980 
one adam michnik now a leading opposition theoretician and 
adviser to walesa was welcomed to the rally at krakows 
jagiellonian university by rector aleksander koj the chief academic 
officer 
its a moving day for me what happened 21 years ago changed my 
generation and my life michnik said 
he said students in 1968 protested because we did not agree 
that poland should become a country where people were stripped of 
their humanity

death by her exhusband while he was on prison furlough was buried 
today but friends who shared her outrage on behalf of battered 
women said her cause will live on

are thrown out in the trash that this is not forgotten says

where 29yearold lisa bianco worked 
at ms biancos funeral at st anthony catholic church the rev 
barry england remembered her as a caring person several mourners 
wore small blue ribbons to symbolize her commitment to helping 
battered women

to people who cried out she healed their wounds having experienced 
pain and hurt herself she continued to love

placed in isolation he said 
ms bianco who started again using her maiden name after the 
divorce had been putting her life back together say coworkers and 
acquaintances 
she had taken a job at the womens shelter and joined a 
commission on the status of women but coworkers said she always 
feared her exhusband would return to kill her

granting the furlough and failing to notify ms bianco 
bonnie bailey president of the mishawaka commission on the 
status of women to which ms bianco was appointed late last year 
described the victim as a very quiet person lowkeyed 
softspoken she said ms bianco did not talk about her battered 
past but typically that is a secret of the victim 
ms bianco started as a counselor at the shelter in august and 
rose quickly into a 14000ayear job as program director said ms 
chilcote she also recently had completed a bachelors degree at 
indiana university taking psychology and business courses 
lisa did everything she could to legally get into the system 
and get her husband locked up and the system failed ms bailey

the seattle times on drugtreatment rules 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome has broken all the rules and 
society is slowly reacting to the epidemic 
the latest change is a recommendation from two federal health 
agencies to make methadone a synthetic narcotic more readily 
available to heroin addicts seeking treatment 
the goal is to fight the spread of aids through needle sharing by 
intravenous drug abusers 
in less than a decade this fatal disease has claimed 49976 
lives and has been diagnosed in 39000 more people after a halting 
start the medical community is in hot pursuit of vaccines but the 
disease has proven an elusive target 
weaning addicts from needles with methadone or reducing the reuse 
of needles by distributing clean needles takes a change of attitude 
for professionals lawmakers and citizens 
as the human and financial toll of the aids epidemic mounts 
society will be reassessing many old values 
these early public health adjustments may seem quaint

while its not a firm timetable its a welcome change from the

too many people on the face of our globe to continue abusing it as 
we have a commitment from the worlds largest industrialized nation 
to abate this maltreatment comes none too soon 
to that end bush has pledged his personal backing as well as

they want dams on a tributary of the amazon stopped 
these are people who understand how to use the wonderful 
mysterious plants of the rain forest they tap resources the 
scientists of the developed world have yet to discover exchange the 
wealth of their culture and rain forest for the shortterm gain of a 
dam here or a road there and brazil will shortchange its future 
brazil doesnt have to listen to world opinion but for its own

the news amp observer raleigh nc on day care 
day care is a painful dilemma for working parents whether those 
parents work to scrape by or whether they work to afford the status 
symbols of the up and coming 
finding care for the most important people in their lives their 
children is a financial and emotional burden 
it is the burden of government as well as states seek to define 
their role in providing day care assistance to those who cannot 
afford it 
though its no longer uncommon for both parents in a home to work 
fulltime and certainly common for single mothers and fathers to 
work employers have taken the attitude that caring for children is 
the familys problem it is but not entirely 
children who are not given adequate care in their first three or 
four years frequently find themselves behind in school from the 
start and they never catch up that hurts them in the adult work 
force and it ultimately hurts their community and their state 
in that sense then the lack of good day care is everyones 
problem

the registerguard eugene ore on wasting energy 
making more efficient use of energy has always been the key to 
improving standards of living despite dwindling resources and 
mounting environmental concerns 
but two years ago the united states progress toward more 
efficient use of energy stalled last year the country actually 
lost ground in terms of efficiency 
for the first time since the energy crisis of the 1970s in 
1988 americans appetite for oil coal natural gas and other types 
of energy grew faster than their productive output 
a continued decline in energy efficiency would have a number of 
unwanted consequences 
the nations bill for imported oil already 40 billion a year 
would rise without a corresponding increase in economic output the 
rate at which finite energy resources are depleted would accelerate 
air pollution acid rain and the greenhouse effect would be 
aggravated 
many of the problems caused by wasteful energy consumption 
ranging from smog to excessive reliance on foreign suppliers need 
to be addressed even if energy remains cheap and plentiful

pope john paul ii opened an extraordinary 
meeting with us roman catholic leaders today and challenged them 
to proclaim the churchs message in a world that does not often 
readily accept it 
john paul spoke briefly in english to 36 us prelates summoned 
to rome for a meeting the americans hope will ease tensions between 
us catholics and the vatican which has been unhappy about dissent 
among the american faithful 
many american catholics for instance disregard church teaching 
on matters such as artificial birth control and remarriage for 
divorced people 
the role of the bishop is expected to be the dominant topic in 
the 12 hours of discussions with top vatican officials through 
saturday other issues on the agenda include the family the 
sacraments and christian education 
i wish to encourage you in your ministry the pope told the 
bishops gathered in the vaticans old synod hall i am fully 
conscious of the challenges you face in bringing the gospel message 
to a world that does not often readily accept it 
your people experience the difficulties of being christians in 
todays world yet at the same time they search for direction in 
following the path marked out by christ 
earlier today a cardinal representing the us bishops declared 
that american democratic freedoms are not at odds with faithfulness 
to the church 
american bishops have maintained that disagreement among 
catholics reflects their democratic heritage the pope however 
says people cannot dissent from church teachings and be considered 
good catholics 
as us bishops we value highly the founding principles of our 
country and its democratic traditions cardinal joseph bernardin 
of chicago said at a news conference before todays meeting began 
while as a community we operate according to different 
principles i do not see these freedoms or their exercise as 
being in conflict with our faithfulness to the universal catholic 
tradition that is ours 
cardinal bernardin gantin head of the vatican congregation for 
bishops said there isnt alarm in the vatican about the us 
church but it is true that problems exist 
we already studied the burning difficult serious problems 
during visits by us bishops last year he said at the news 
conference and this weeks meeting will focus on how to resolve 
them he mentioned the secularization of us society as a problem 
for the american church 
i expect that there will be a freeflowing discussion among 
everyone there archbishop john l may of st louis president of 
the us national conference of catholic bishops said in an 
interview tuesday 
he added there will be probably in any freeflowing 
discussion points of difference points of difference that will be 
discussed and faced 
the vatican believes the 52millionmember american church is 
critical because of its size its wealth and its potential to set 
worldwide trends 
the pope summoned much of the american catholic hierarchy to rome 
for this weeks session the five active us cardinals 30 
archbishops and a bishop all representing major dioceses 
bernardin said tuesday that the us hierarchy hoped to increase 
the vaticans understanding of american culture and the churchs 
part in it 
when you are involved in a universal church such as ours there 
is a need for communication he said the more we can do the 
better everyone understands what is involved 
may said some problems with rome stemmed from a lack of 
understanding by vatican officials some of these men have not 
been in the united states or not very much he said in a 
telephone interview 
he said he hoped the meetings lead to a deeper understanding of 
separation of church and state a deeper understanding of freedom of 
thought in the united states a deeper understanding of the 
democratic process that were used to which is not always the way 
things are done in the church

protesting howard university students succeeded 
in driving republican national chairman lee atwater from the 
predominantly black schools board of trustees saying he encouraged 
racism during his work for president bushs election campaign 
atwater submitted a resignation letter to the school tuesday 
night after hundreds of students took over the administration 
building to protest his appointment 
earlier tuesday bush had defended the choice of atwater who 
headed his presidential campaign but district of columbia mayor 
marion s barry said atwater should quit 
in his resignation letter atwater said he wanted to help the 
school but continuing the controversy surrounding my appointment 
any longer defeats that goal 
todays events at howard demonstrate the possibility that 
someone could be injured in the protest he said that i could 
not accept i would never forgive myself if someone was hurt in one 
of these episodes 
atwaters resignation came 48 hours before bush was scheduled to 
address a united negro college fund dinner in new york 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said today that bush had 
no reaction to the atwaters stepping down other than what he 
told you yesterday during a news conference he hoped things 
would be worked out and they have been 
fitzwater said atwater had called bushs chief of staff john 
sununu tuesday night to tell him of his decision and sununu then 
notified the president 
howard students were infuriated when college president james 
cheek appointed atwater to the board in january the students cited 
atwaters use during the bush campaign of ads highlighting willie 
horton a black rapist and murderer from the home state of 
democratic candidate michael dukakis 
he masterminded the use of the willie horton issue to 
contribute to the rising antiblack sentiment of the american 
people said michael lewis a spokesman for the informal group of 
students that organized protests beginning last week at the schools 
convocation 
civil rights leader jesse jackson interviewed today on cbs 
this morning said atwater made the right decision 
the signals that were sent in the willie horton ad were not so 
much about prison furloughs but about race inciting fears in 
white people and creating very painful feelings among 
africanamericans jackson said after eight years of former 
president reagan there are fewer black students in colleges 
more of them are in jail 
unfortunately lee atwater symbolizes the worst of that 
situation 
hundreds of students had stormed through the administration 
building during the annual charter day convocation and prevented 
entertainer bill cosby from giving the main address 
a group of students remained in the building through tuesday 
when they were joined by hundreds more inside and out chanting 
lees gotta go and students unite were not to be 
defeated 
it is my assessment that the lee atwater situation is tearing 
up the university barry said after meeting privately with the 
protesters i think for the sake of peace mr atwater ought to 
find a way to gracefully resign 
bush commented on the controversy during his news conference at 
the white house asked if the howard students had a legitimate 
complaint bush said no i think its a good thing hes on the 
board i think thatll work out just fine 
district police had stormed the administration building about 
1230 pm tuesday breaking down the front doors with clubs and 
dropping officers onto the roof by helicopter 
we came here to assist the howard university force which asked 
for our help said police chief maurice turner 
but the nearly 100 officers left the scene without making any 
arrests at the request of cheek who said school officials decided 
to let the students maintain control of the building 
we are not willing to have the students removed by force 
cheek said its too risky we have decided to set up the 
administrative process someplace else 
students remained in the building even after atwater announced 
his resignation from the board saying they intended to press other 
demands with the school administration those demands included a 
better financial aid system improved campus security and amnesty 
for protest leaders 
bush chose atwater to head the republican national committee 
shortly after the election atwater has said one of his goals in the 
post is to attract more black support to the gop

oliver north told nelson bunker hunt i dont 
care if i have to go to jail i dont care if i have to lie to 
congress a fundraiser for the contras testified today 
carl channell said he overheard north make the comment to hunt at 
the close of a meeting at the petroleum club in dallas on sept 11 
1985 
channell had arranged to make a plane available for north to fly 
down from washington so that the white house aide could describe the 
contras military needs to hunt a wealthy texas businessman 
north talked to hunt about 5 million to 6 million worth of 
items the contras needed to stay alive recalled channell 
including planes two types of ammunition clothing food and 
medical supplies after dinner as they prepared to leave the club 
channell listened as north and hunt discussed central american 
politics 
hunt asked north whether he was worried about getting in 
trouble channell recalled ollie said no i dont care if i 
have to go to jail for this i dont care if i have to lie to 
congress about this channel testified 
hunt just chortled channell recalled 
hunt contributed 237500 to channells taxexempt national 
endowment for the preservation of liberty and also made a 237500 
loan to the organization 
channell pleaded guilty on april 29 1987 to depriving the 
government of tax revenue by using nepl to solicit contributions for 
military equipment for the contras 
one of the 12 criminal charges against north is that he conspired 
to defraud the treasury of tax revenue six of the charges accuse 
north of making false statements and obstructing congress by 
attempting to hide his efforts on behalf of the contras 
channell said north worked closely with the private fundraising 
operation for the contras 
when one contributor john ramsey of wichita falls taxas wired 
money to pay for a contra shipment that was about to be unloaded 
north sent him a mailgram saying thank you for the help on such 
short notice 
north ended a powerful address and slide show to 30 potential 
contributors on june 27 1985 at the old executive office building 
by displaying a picture of the grave of what he said was a young 
contra soldier and saying cant american do better than this 
america should be doing better than this said channell 
wealthy connecticut widow barbara newington and others expressed 
concern that their contributions might be misused and channell said 
he told north that checks were being written to five different 
organizations 
north straightened the matter out by saying that you should 
work through richard miller and francis gomez who had set up a 
cayman islands corporation to receive contributions channell said 
i liked dr contra leader adolfo calero a lot but he was 
running a shoestring organization said channell when he traveled 
to florida to talk to contra leaders it was almost like this 
thing was going on parttime said channell 
in august 1985 north met in his office with channell and ellen 
garwood from a wealth austin texas family who gave 75000 to 
buy a maule aircraft to supply the contras 
at the meeting north also told her of the wellarmed highly 
maneuverable soviet hind helicopters in nicaragua and how the 
contras needed handheld missiles to shoot them down 
meanwhile prosecutors say the jury should convict north if it 
finds he engaged in a coverup regardless of whether he was acting 
under orders or was afraid of news leaks 
when an individual is asked a question by congress there are 
only two legitimate responses the individual may decline to answer 
the question or answer it honestly the prosecution said monday 
in a court filing he cannot with impunity knowingly and willfully 
answer with a falsehood 
in opening statements norths lawyers suggested that his conduct 
was authorized by his superiors the prosecutions motion is an 
attempt to head off that defense 
john keker head of the prosecution team asked us district 
judge gerhard gesell to specify when giving final instructions to 
the jury that norths alleged motivation for lying is irrelevant 
to the charges against him 
if north genuinely believed disclosure of certain information 
would damage important interests he could have made an open 
refusal to disclose or invoked any applicable privilege asserting 
his reasons for doing so the prosecution said

the following is the text of a statement 
issued wednesday by the revolutionary justice organization which 
holds american hostages in lebanon the arabiclanguage statement 
was translated by the associated press in beirut 
in the name of the almighty 
after a thorough reading of the satanic verses book and its 
contents that insult islam and the arab prophet and after examining 
the study of the socalled salman rushdie the revolutionary justice 
organization declares that it has completed its preparations to 
execute the just sentence issued by the esteemed cleric and the 
great struggler ayatollah khomeini against salman rushdie hence it 
puts forward the following evidence for carrying out the sentence 
1 insulting islam and the arab prophet is an insult to the 
latest and greatest human civilization represented by revolutionary 
islam 
2 salman rushdies record indicates that he was a branch member 
of the freemasons movement in england immediately after the 
publication of his satanic verses book he was promoted to full 
official membership of the freemasons highest council in england 
or the church of organized atheism which combats divine religions 
especially christianity and islam and their great prophets 
3 imam ayatollah khomeini with his acute awareness of the grave 
consequences against the future of the divine religions emanating 
from this freemasonic and zionist attack has handed down his 
verdict when the arabs and those who claim to be the protectors of 
islam and speak for all the moslems remained in tight silence 
the revolutionary justice organization also declares that before 
taking any measures it will find itself compelled to attack british 
police posts assigned to protect salman rushdie in order to get to 
him to carry out the sentence we hold the british government 
responsible in advance for the human and material losses among the 
british police and their posts that could result from the attacks on 
them this warning applies to all countries that are currently 
negotiating with the british government to extend asylum and 
protection to rushdie 
victory to the oppressed 
glory and immortality to the martyrs

an unusually dry winter has helped ease africas 
disastrous locust plague a un official said wednesday 
the problem has by no means been eradicated but it has 
improved dramatically in the last five months said jeremy roffey 
a locust expert at the food and agriculture organization based in 
rome 
other helpful factors have been strict measures to combat the 
pests and their migration to the sea as they moved across the 
atlantic 
in january swarms of locusts devoured crops in sudan ethiopia 
and chad which already were suffering critical food shortages 
desert locusts aided by easterly october winds traveled 3100 
miles to reach caribbean islands at the same time locusts crossed 
the red sea into saudi arabia new invasions were reported in cape 
verde and senegal and swarms reached the north african states of 
algeria morocco tunisia and libya 
rain provides the moisture needed for locust eggs to develop in 
sand or soil

a partial solar eclipse visible across 
western north america bored scientists but thrilled crowds that were 
able to see it despite clouds covering parts of the region 
its fabulous to know this is actually taking place its very 
fascinating said edie lurie an employee at the california 
institute of technology in pasadena where dozens used solar 
telescopes to watch the moon eclipse 37 percent of the sun at 950 
am pst tuesday 
as the moon passed between the earth and sun to cause the partial 
eclipse it was possible to see mountains on the edge of the moon 
silhouetted against the sun also visible were gas jets on the suns 
surface and a giant group of sunspots that on monday and tuesday 
produced major solar flares eruptions of heat and radiation 
including the largest since 1984 
clouds over downtown salt lake city dashed hansen planetariums 
plans to set up telescopes to watch the moon block 36 percent of the 
sun at 1110 am mst 
its a bummer but thats the way it goes planetarium 
spokesman patrick wiggins said 
the eclipse was visible to at least some extent west of a 
diagonal line stretching roughly from mazatlan mexico northeast to 
dallas and chicago views were best farther west and north 
in sunny los angeles 600 schoolchildren and at least 400 other 
people watched the eclipse at griffith observatory through 
telescopes and other devices equipped with filters to prevent eye 
injury 
there was a childlike delight with the wonder of nature 
observatory director ed krupp said 
most astronomers were unimpressed saying they were waiting for a 
total solar eclipse that will sweep across hawaii the pacific 
ocean lower baja california in mexico central america colombia 
and brazil on july 11 1991 
you can see a partial eclipse every three or four years said 
caltech astrophysicist ken libbrecht theyre not that exciting a 
total eclipse is exciting 
in tucson dozens of citizens peered through telescopes on the 
university of arizona mall to see the moon eclipse 23 percent of the 
sun at 1055 am mst but 90 solar scientists stayed inside 
attending a fiveday conference titled the sun in time 
thats partly my fault said conference coorganizer mark 
giampapa an astronomer at the national solar observatory i 
should have listed it in the program partial eclipse presented by 
god 
in anchorage alaska where the moon obscured 80 percent of the 
sun at 913 am ast the eclipse was watched by 26 students from 
bartlett high school several people wearing welders helmets as 
filters and providence hospital workers who ended a staff meeting 
early to see the spectacle 
clouds parted long enough to allow a glimpse of the eclipse for 
100 people outside the oregon museum of science and industry in 
often rainy portland 
typical oregon astronomy said amateur astronomer dan dunn 
you always have to deal with the clouds 
scientists had warned against staring at the sun directly or 
through inadequate filters including smoked glass and photographic 
film or filters 
alan macrobert of sky amp telescope magazine said 245 eye injuries 
were reported in the united states after an eclipse in 1970 but 
warnings about the danger reduced the number to three during a 1984 
partial eclipse

iraqi ambush killed five iranian soldiers feb 17 it would be the 
deadliest clash since a ceasefire took effect seven months ago

un iraniraq military observer group who have monitored the 
truce told him of the incident 
a un spokeswoman confirmed that undersecretarygeneral marrack 
goulding the chief un peacekeeper had received reports from his 
officers that five iranian soldiers had been shot in the back and 
killed 
iran said that they had been killed in an iraqi ambush 
however the investigation by uniimog observers could not confirm 
this the spokeswoman nadia younes said 
peacekeeping officials normally do not verify allegations of 
truce violations by iran and iraq leaving that for a 
secretarygenerals report that is issued every six months when the 
mandate of the un peacekeepers must be renewed the most recent 
report was issued feb 2 
mahallatis letter said iraqi forces ambushed our patrols

border with iraq and about 310 miles west of tehran

separated by only a few dozen yards in many places and in one place 
face each other across 30 yards of desert the secretarygeneral

department and horne who has been with the sheriffs office for 38 
years chased the supects car for about three blocks

their car

the senate labor and human resources committee 
today approved legislation to raise the minimum wage to 465 an 
hour over three years and committee chairman edward m kennedy 
predicted the first increase in eight years would be swiftly 
approved next week by the full senate 
the committee approved kennedys bill which president bush has 
threatened to veto by an 115 vote with two republicans joining 
democrats for the majority 
i think well get an increase this is going to be before the 
congress before the senate and before the president in the next few 
weeks kennedy dmass said afterward 
this will basically restore a minimum standard of decency to 
workers who are now covered by the 335anhour minimum wage that 
has been in effect since 1981 he said 
kennedy said he is glad to listen to the administrations 
proposal for a lower training wage for newly hired workers but 
said he and committee democrats remained strongly opposed to it 
because it has no provision for real training and all 
minimumwage workers would be covered 
kennedy predicted that a presidential veto would be overridden 
were going to get this legislation achieved he said 
bush raised the subject of the minimum wage during a morning 
meeting with republican leaders in congress white house press 
secretary marlin fitzwater said bush had given congress our best 
and last figure up front and his proposal for an increase to 425 
an hour is fair and firm and his last offer 
labor secretary elizabeth dole said last week that bush wants an 
increase of 90 cents an hour to 425 over three years she said 
the raise must be accompanied by a provision allowing businesses to 
pay all newly hired workers 335 an hour for the first six months 
of their employment 
kennedys support for some type of subminimum was qualified 
with the longtime opponent of the provision saying it would have to 
be accompanied by training and education for new workers 
the concept of an educational component to the minimum wage 
coupled with real training is not unappealing said kennedy 
sen orrin hatch the ranking republican on the committee and a 
longtime opponent of the minimum wage earlier said he will support 
an increase if democrats accept a training wage 
if theyll work with the president there will be a raise in 
the minimum wage said hatch rutah 
an aide to kennedy said the senator remains nowhere near the 
administrations position on this despite his change 
we are willing to discuss a training wage said the aide who 
spoke on condition of anonymity 
for the past eight years what we saw was intransigence from 
the white house the bush administration has shown some flexibility 
and we too are willing to be flexible and to discuss a real training 
wage said the aide 
other democrats also said theyll take some form of the 
training wage in hopes of reaching agreement with the republican 
administration 
i think some kind of compromise is going to have to be worked 
out at some point said sen paul simon dill a member of the 
labor panel who has also opposed a subminimum wage 
organized labor has opposed the second tier because of fears that 
workers would be fired in favor of those covered by the lower 
standard but the aflcio now says it is open to discussion on the 
training wage 
one of the problems in the administration proposal is that 
every time you take a job you become a trainee again aflcio 
spokeswoman lorrie mchugh said and most of the jobs the 
lowerpaying jobs are not skill jobs dont require training at 
all

highaltitude rescue work 
the three men who set out to climb north americas highest peak

check a snow cave if the climbers are not in the cave an aerial 
search will be conducted mock said

its a designers job to make good clothes 
creative genius is another thing 
there are lots of nice clothes on the milan runway this week 
where the italian fallwinter 198990 ready to wear collections are 
showing but it wasnt until the shows of gianfranco ferre and fendi 
by karl lagerfeld that the fashion crowd was treated to innovative 
creations the kind experts call works of art and end up in fashion 
museums 
ferre has always stood out in the milan designer crowd known for 
its tailored casual clothes by creating a structured style that 
looks great on slim tall models but is more difficult to imagine on 
the average woman 
a broad shouldered sihouette with cinched waist and narrow hips 
and either a super short or calf length hemline is his trademark he 
loves billowy blouses with big stiff standup collars favors pants 
over skirts and likes to nip the waistline in wide belts and trim 
cuffs and collars in rich fur 
the genius of this winters collection is the combining of the 
conventional and the eccentric 
thus a pair of perfectly mantailored gray flannel pants is 
spruced up by an intricately pleated black and white blouse topped 
by a fox fur scarf dyed to look like zebra and wrapped around the 
neck 
all of this is wonderful for the fashion pages but how is one to 
eat drink and even talk behind a scarf that covers half the face 
ferre also adorns calflength beige cashmere tunics with these 
furry feminine neck warmers more often than not the scarves come 
with warm but equally impractical enormous matching muffs 
his blouses not only have have generous collars but also wide 
cuffs with big gold cufflinks 
along with the staple milan shades of brown black and gray 
ferre uses a lot of red mixing it with gray flannel by day and 
black and gold by night 
adding his voice to the fur debate raised this week between those 
opting for fake furs and those who wont settle for anything but the 
real thing ferre not only interspersed fake and real skins but 
dyed real fox to look like fake leopard and zebra 
the fendis marched on in their search for unusual innovative 
ways to work the pelt 
for more than 20 years the fendis have combined their fur 
expertise with the designing genius of karl lagerfeld to create the 
most imaginative story in the fur market several years ago they 
exhibited their combined technical and creative efforts at romes 
modern art gallery 
for next season fendi takes the fur to its bare minimum 
stripping it of lavish silk and quilted linings and tanning the 
leather side to look like polished cotton thus every coat is 
reversible 
sometimes the pelts from the humble beaver to the lofty mink is 
worked in patches with tufts of fur pearing through the leather 
side at others it is pierced to create a featherlike lacey effect 
this minimal look is further emphasized by the taupecolored 
ribbed wool tunics and tights that were the exclusive undercoat 
outfit 
there is lots of combining of fur and fabric in this fendi 
collection with fur inlays livening up otherwise simple wool coats 
these furs starting at more than 5000 with some coats at 
nearly 100000 are not for the woman who has saved for years for 
her one fur coat the furs are not showy and not terribly warm and 
despite the exquisite workmanship have a fragile look

nothing to catch 1000 in a night voss said

the defense department has been largely 
unsuccessful in developing and implementing a program to minimize 
hazardous wastes at military bases the general accounting office 
said wednesday 
the agency an investigative arm of congress found that the 
services have made varying degrees of progress in implementing 
programs to reduce hazardous waste 50 percent by the end of 1992 
clearly the pentagons efforts to reduce the amount of 
hazardous waste generated have to date been unsatisfactory said 
rep vic fazio dcalif one of two congressmen who requested the 
report 
the gao study found that the army the navy and the air force 
report annually on hazardous wastes to the pentagon but that the 
report does not require the information be correlated with the 
workload of major military installations 
in addition the gao found a number of inconsistencies and 
inaccurate methods of data collection making the information 
unreliable its the same old problem we have found in every other 
aspect of dods hazardous waste program somehow the message never 
gets through to the base commander or others responsible for 
daytoday waste management activities said rep mike synar 
dokla 
the pentagon is spending 500 million in fiscal 1989 to clean up 
the old hazardous waste dumps and other sites and more than 100 
million a year disposing of newly generated hazardous waste 
the gao report recommended that the secretary of defense 
establish a standard methodology for collecting and reporting 
hazardous waste within the department

a private report called wednesday for a 
national campaign to reverse an economydamaging decline in 
americas savings rate by offering government supersaver bonds 
through monthly payroll deductions 
the report released by the american business conference said a 
low national savings rate is the biggest economic problem facing the 
united states and threatens its ability to remain competitive in the 
global market 
our high consumption rate is the single most important 
cause of both unprecedented trade deficits and inadequate domestic 
investment during the mid1980s the report said restoring 
national saving at least to the level of the 1970s should be the 
central goal of national economic policy 
the authors found that while the governments huge budget 
deficits the most popular villain have contributed to the 
problem the decline in national savings primarily has been caused 
by high consumption of products and services by individuals 
george hatsopoulos chairman of the federal reserve bank of 
boston and lead author of the report said supersaver bonds 
would help people establish regular savings programs since the 
securities could be purchased only through monthly payroll 
deductions 
people would be less likely to spend earnings from the 
governmentissued bonds since the profits would be available only 
when the securities were redeemed after seven years he said 
hatsopoulos said people would be attracted to the bonds by 
premium interest rates and a national campaign to persuade them that 
its not only good for you its also good for the country 
overall national savings the difference between the nations 
output in goods and services and what is consumed by government and 
individuals fell from 79 percent in the 1970s to 21 percent 
during 198587 the study indicated 
over the same period individuals consumption of goods and 
services rose from 693 percent of national income to 741 percent 
the report attributed the increase in personal consumption 
largely to growth in disposable income a rise in household wealth 
that exceeded the increase in national wealth the maturing of the 
population to ages above 16 when spending is higher and the 
spending of equity that was converted to cash in corporate takeovers 
and buyouts 
it found that people cannot be counted on to rationally 
formulate lifetime consumption plans based on both their current 
wealth and their expected earnings and that they tend to spend 
more if they have extra cash on hand 
the report said the propensity to spend whatever is on hand has 
been highlighted as people receive unexpected lumps of cash from 
their stock investments when they are paid premiums in the course of 
corporate buyouts 
rather than reinvesting the cash payments a big portion gets 
spent the authors found 
even highincome households with substantial asset holdings may 
overreact to fluctuations in current income failing to distribute a 
current windfall over current and future consumption it found 
in addition to recommending a program to increase personal 
savings the report also proposed action on two other fronts to 
increase national savings from a low point that is unprecedented for 
a period of economic expansion not only for the united states but 
for all industrialized countries 
reducing the federal deficit cutting government spending on 
goods and services is the most direct approach although raising 
taxes and thus lowering private consumption would help to a lesser 
degree the report said 
eliminating incentives for corporate buyouts the report said 
the federal tax structure should be revised to eliminate incentives 
for corporate debt and thus reduce the trend toward higher cash 
payouts to shareholders 
the authors cautioned that while the goal should be to return 
america to the savings rate of the 1970s the shift should not be 
done too rapidly lest the decline in demand topple the country 
into recession 
the study was written by hatsopoulos who is chairman of thermo 
electron corp and massachusetts institute of technology economists 
james poterba and paul krugman the american business conference is 
a group of 100 chief executives from fastgrowing midsized 
companies

the chairman of a house science subcommittee 
said wednesday his panel feels a very strong sense of 
frustration over the bush administrations failure to fund a new 
program designed to assist us industry with hightechnology 
innovation 
rep doug walgren dpa spoke out at a hearing focusing on the 
advanced technology program at the commerce departments national 
institute of technology and standards 
the program is designed to coordinate development of 
emergingtechnologies and manufacturingresearch consortia foster 
industry government and university partnerships and monitor 
cooperation between federal and regional agencies 
but no money was allotted for the program in the fiscal 1989 or 
1990 budgets 
walgren said that when the trade bill of which the program is a 
part became law last year we had high hopes that finally we 
can move ahead and provide the same kind of support to american 
companies that is provided to sciencebased commercial activities in 
the countries which are our greatest competitors 
he asserted that if we do not modernize our thinking about the 
role of government and provide the american private sector with the 
resources they need to compete against the kind of competition which 
is coming from overseas we will im afraid miss out on the vast 
payoffs which these technologies promise 
rep tom campbell rcalif said the jury is still out 
regarding what attitude the new administration will take toward the 
advanced technology program and other civilian hightechnology 
initiatives 
until we have a national science adviser and the president gets 
his team in place we might suspend judgment at least critical 
judgment he said

afghan rebels said wednesday they 
overran an army post that protects jalalabad the strategic city 
near the khyber pass and kabul radio accused pakistan of air and 
artillery attacks across the border 
the guerrilla governments leader said in a radio broadast from 
pakistan the moslem insurgents were on the verge of final 
victory over the marxist government of afghanistan three weeks 
after the soviet military withdrawal 
pakistani officials could not be reached for comment about the 
charges of military interference but prime minister benazir bhutto 
dismissed similar charges last month 
jalalabad capital of nangarhar province is 75 mites east of 
kabul on the highway to pakistan about 45 miles from the border 
one guerrilla source said the jalalabad airport also had been 
captured but another spokesman known only as satultah said in 
peshawar pakistan that fighting continued there 
satullah said guerrillas bombarded the samarkhiel fortress on 
jalalabads outskirts with longrange artiltery late tuesday and it 
fell early wednesday kabul radio said the garrison was attacked 
but reported only one soldier killed and did not say it had fallen 
several other afghan sources confirmed satullahs claim but 
there was no independent confirmation 
kabul radio said pakistan forces are using their helicopter 
gunships and heavy artillery to attack government positions in 
eastern nangarhar province and in kandahar the southeastern 
province 
ms bhutto said last month the pakistan military had not 
participated in afghanistans decadeold civil war and would not do 
so 
about 35 million afghan refugees live just inside pakistan in 
border camps and cities the insurgents use as bases and supply 
points 
moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in april 
1978 and soviet soldiers entered afghanistan in december 1979 an 
estimated 115000 were there at outset of the unsponsored 
withdrawal which was completed feb 15 
afghanistans official radio also said four pakistan army 
helicopters flew afghan guerrilla leaders and field commanders 
wednesday to ghazi abad about 10 miles east of jalalabad 
insurgents destroyed a military transport plane at the jalalabad 
airport tuesday kabul radio in a report confirmed by guerrilla 
sources said two people were killed 
satullah said insurgent positions around the city particularly 
to the south were bombed in retaliation for the capture of the 
samarkhiel fortress another guerrilla source reported 
indiscriminate bombing last night and this morning 
insurgents near jalalabad shot down an afghan helicopter gunship 
and a sovietmade mig25 jet with usmade missiles wednesday and 
there were no survivors satullah said 
stinger missiles are credited with inflicting costly losses on 
the soviet air force since washington began supplying them to the 
insurgents two years ago the united states and pakistan have been 
the main suppliers of arms and financial backing to the guerrillas 
sibghatullah mojaddidi presisent of the new governmentinexile 
told afghans in a 16minute radio address from insurgent 
headquarters in peshawar 
we have no doubt at all that the puppet government which is 
responsible for the killing the destruction and the displacement of 
millions of afghan refugees will never be able to stand against 
afghanistan again 
he said his priority is complete removal of the government in 
kabul the return of peace and security to the whole country and 
preparations for the suitable conditions for the return of 
refugees 
mojaddidi asked the united nations and the islamic conference 
organization to recognize his government which he said would hold 
its first cabinet meeting friday inside afghanistan the site was 
not disclosed

former supreme court nominee robert bork 
says his grilling before the senate in 1987 set a precedent for the 
rough treatment that john tower is getting in confirmation hearings 
for secretary of defense 
of course i feel sympathy for him bork said tuesday before 
addressing 350 local republicans i think my episode set a 
pattern those folks tasted a little blood 
senate confirmation of tower has been jeopardized by allegations 
of drinking and womanizing and concerns about his ties to defense 
contractors 
bork nominated for the supreme court by president reagan 
testified for 30 hours over five days during his confirmation 
hearings defending his conservative record and narrow reading of 
constitutional protections that enraged civil liberties and womens 
rights groups 
after listening to 112 witnesses over 12 sessions the senate 
rejected borks nomination 5842 it was only the 11th time the 
senate had voted against a supreme court nominee 
during a dinner speech the former federal appellate judge said 
i think its legitimate to ask if tower has personal habits that 
will interfere with the performance of his duties but he added 
that tower should be confirmed because those habits did not prevent 
him from being an effective senator or compiling an impressive 
resume 
bork said there is a new venomous mood in the capital and 
senate democrats in a variety of ways are intent on taking over 
the functions of the president 
bork left the bench in 1988 to debate discuss how we should 
view the constitution and how we should select judges he is 
working on a book that explores the intrusion of politics into 
constitutional law

prosecutors made two more arrests wednesday in an 
insidertrading scandal that has raised questins about japans 
bigmoney politics and stained the vaunted integrity of its civil 
service 
opposition parties boycotted debate on the budget bringing 
parliaments business to a halt and renewed their demands that 
prime minister noburo takeshita call new elections and resign so the 
public can render its verdict 
those arrested wednesday were takashi kato a former vice 
minister of labor and masao tatsumi a former senior executive of 
the busiess information conglomerate recruit co 
tatsumi is accused of bribing kato in 1986 to obtain favorable 
treatment of recruit by the ministry 
kato was among more than 150 senior bureaucrats political 
figures and businessmen who were offered bargain shares in 
recruitcosmos co a real estate subsidiary of recruit before the 
company was listed 
when the shares went on public sale their value soard and kato 
made a profit estimated at about 56000 
prosecutors have arrested 12 people so far but released two 
junior recruit officials tuesday and have yet to decide whether 
formal charges will be filed against them 
they say kato the highestranking public official held in the 
scandal influenced a labor ministry decision on publishing 
employment information that was to recruits advantage a 
lowerranking ministry official shigeru kano was arrested on 
bribery charges last month 
for japans civil servants this spelled a most embarrassing 
scandal that discredited them all in the eyes of the public the 
influential national newspaper asahi said in an editorial 
we wonder if bureaucrats are still able to really serve the 
public at large if their consciences are being clouded by bribes 
and so much extravagance they are betraying the public 
the japanese generally have regarded senior civil servants as 
officials of high integrity 
katos arrest came two days after that of hisashi shinto 78 
former chairman of nippon telegraph and telephone corp the worlds 
largest company in terms of stock value 
shinto also is being held on bribery charges in connection with 
alleged favorable treatment of recruit by the giant 
telecommunications utility 
takeshitas administration has been buffeted by the scandal since 
the first reports of it last june 
three cabinet ministers have resigned because of links to 
recruit the governing liberal democratic party has lost interim 
elections and a storm surrounds political and corporate ethics 
in parliament the boycotting japan socialist party komeito 
clean government democratic socialist party and japan communist 
party said they also would insist takeshitas predecessor as prime 
minister yasuhiro nakasone appear before a committee 
three nakasone aides bought 29000 recruitcosmos shares in 1986 
but he denies involvement in the recruit affair 
without nakasone appearing we cannot participate in the 
session said shun ohide of the socialists the main opposition 
group 
takeshita has coupled his refusal to resign with repeated pledges 
of political reform but polls indicate a steady decline in his 
public support 
yomiuri japans largest newspaper released a poll last week in 
which only 213 percent of respondents said they supported the his 
government down 61 points from january the january poll was the 
first since takeshita took office in november 1987 to show him with 
an approval rating below 30 percent

the government announced today it is expelling a 
group of iranians on security grounds because of irans death 
sentence against novelist salman rushdie 
it also warned britons living in lebanon to leave saying they 
are under increased threat following irans severing of diplomatic 
ties with britain on tuesday three britons are held hostage in 
lebanon 
the foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe announced the 
expulsions in the house of commons britain also ordered the closing 
of the iranian consulate in hong kong a british colony and gave 
the staff two weeks to leave howe said 
government sources speaking on condition of anonymity said up 
to 30 iranians will be ordered to leave britain 
howes comments came after an iranian newspaper today said the 
break in britishiranian ties will adversely affect the british 
hostages in lebanon also today a group holding two american 
hostages said it has completed plans to kill rushdie whose new 
book the satanic verses led to the break 
another iranian newspaper said tehran must also cut economic ties 
with britain and threaten other western nations with the same action 
unless they suppress the satanic verses which some say 
blasphemes islam 
howe noting iran has refused to revoke its death sentence 
against rushdie said we have therefore decided on security 
grounds a number of iranians must be required to leave this 
country 
we are keeping the activities of other iranians under very 
close review he added howe said the expulsion orders would be 
issued shortly there are about 25000 iranians in briton 
one government official speaking on condition of anonymity said 
those expelled will be people held to have close links with the 
iranianregime using his strongest language since the 
controversy began howe called the iranian government a deplorable 
regime 
responding to calls by legislators to ban trade with iran howe 
replied we stand ready to take whatever action may be necessary 
in the light of events 
in beirut the proiranian revolutionary justice organization 
said it has completed its preparations to execute the just 
sentence issued by esteemed cleric and great struggler ayatollah 
khomeini against salman rushdie 
khomeini sentenced rushdie to death feb 14 rushdie was born 
into a moslem family in india and is a naturalized british citizen 
he has been in hiding since the death order 
the statement delivered to a western news agency in beirut said 
the execution will be preceeded by attacks on british police 
the statement was accompanied by an instant photograph of hostage 
edward austin tracy of burlington vt but it did not threaten the 
hostages 
the group also holds writer joseph james cicippio 58 of valley 
forge pa who was acting comptroller of the american university of 
beirut when he was abducted 
irans kayhan international newspaper said of the rushdie 
controversy the event will leave its negative impact on the fate 
of the british hostages in lebanon 
the british hostages are anglican church envoy terry waite 49 
journalist john mccarthy 32 and brian keenan 38 an 
englishlanguage teacher at the american university of beirut all 
are believed held by proiranian shiite moslems 
the british embassy in beirut today advised britons against 
traveling to lebanon and advised the estimated 125 already there to 
leave the warning was broadcast by christiancontrolled radio 
stations 
there are 15 hostages including nine americans held in lebanon 
terry anderson chief middle east correspondent for the associated 
press is the hostage held longest he was kidnapped march 16 1985 
and has been held longer than any hostage 
tehrans farsilanguage abrar called for an end to economic ties 
with britain just one day after iran announced the severing of 
diplomatic relations 
kayhan international and abrar both warned that irans relations 
with other western nations may be cut because of those countries 
support of britain and their withdrawal of envoys from tehran their 
reports were carried by irans islamic republic news agency which 
is monitored in nicosia 
iran in 1987 imported 528 million in goods from britain irans 
exports to britain that year totaled 321 million 
britains 11 european economic community partners as well as 
canada norway and sweden recalled their diplomats from iran after 
khomeini ordered rushdie killed only the swedish envoys have 
returned to tehran 
a trade ban would prevent european nations from winning lucrative 
contracts to help irans reconstruction following its eightyear war 
with iraq the cost of rebuilding has been estimated at up to 500 
billion 
irna quoted abrar as saying it is now up to the countrys 
political officials to remove the assumption of preserving economic 
relations from the minds of londondwellers and warn other western 
countries against the consequences of enmity toward islam and the 
islamic republic 
abrar concluded british colonialism must taste its first 
bitter experience of insulting the beliefs of more than 1 billion 
moslems in the world

that fellow in lubbock texas was practicing 
an old american tradition when he gave president bush an earful on 
how he was doing in the presidency 
in bushs case the opinion was solicited by the president and 
was welcome the lubbock man told him things are going just 
great the president told the press on tuesday but the custom of 
giving the government a piece of ones mind is older than the 
country and more often than not the petitions from the 
countryside come bearing barbs 
or splinters when the construction industry blamed jimmy carter 
for high interest rates builders mailed him footlong twobyfours 
to drive home their protest read one please reread your 1976 
campaign speeches its amazing how much youve forgotten in four 
short years 
the national archives reached into its storehouses of government 
records to celebrate the practice of citizen telling government or 
telling government off among the examples on exhibit on the 
archives walls are some of those blunt twobyfours addressed to 
carter 
one lament that might sound familiar to bush as he replaces the 
old reagan guard with new bush faces was the petition mary 
katherine goodard wrote in 1789 in a failing attempt to remain 
postmaster of baltimore 
she hath been discharged without the smallest imputations of 
any fault and without any previous notice whatever her petititon 
said these are but poor rewards indeed for 14 years faithful 
services performed in the worst of times 
when the bill of rights gave the people the right to petition 
the government for a redress of grievances the founding fathers 
were only accepting the status quo the people of america had been 
seeking redress long before there was a constitution 
in 1773 the governor of connecticut protested to a member of 
parliament the closing of the port of boston in retaliation for the 
boston tea party he wrote we are at a loss to conceive how the 
destruction of the east india companys tea could be a just or 
reasonable ground for punishing so severely thousands of innocent 
people 
a century later annie davis a slave from northern maryland 
petitioned abraham lincoln with as urgent a question as ever 
confronts humanity you will please let me know if we are free 
 
and nearly a century after that earl gideon put pencil to pad in 
his cell in bay county fla and wrote a petition to the supreme 
court that moved history 
gideon was serving five years for breaking into a poolroom the 
question is very simple he wrote i requested the court to 
appoint me an attorney and the court refused 
the supreme court agreed and established the right of poor 
defendants to be represented by lawyers at the public expense if 
need be 
one of the biggest petitions ever to reach washington remains as 
it was received in 1893 rolled up on two huge wooden spools it 
consists of hundreds of sheets taped together bearing an estimated 
150000 signatures appealing for the establishment of a federal 
road department for the purpose of promoting knowledge in the art 
of constructing and maintaining roads 
congress took the hint creating the office of road inquiry in 
the department of agriculture must have pleased the petitions 
originator a bicycle manufacturer and his customers 
few citizens petitioning their government ever did so with more 
charm than a grade schooler from fair lawn nj who wrote to 
president ford after he pardoned president nixon for the crimes of 
watergate 
dear president ford 
i think you are half right and half wrong 
yours truly

dozens of jewish women across the soviet union 
some joined by their children launched a threeday hunger strike 
wednesday to protest what they say are arbitrary kremlin policies 
barring their emigration 
inside a small dark apartment in a prefabricated moscow 
highrise 18 women and four of their children gathered to begin the 
third annual hunger strike organized by a group called jewish women 
against refusal 
the date they chose for the beginning of their threeday fast was 
symbolic march 8 is international womens day in the soviet union 
a national holiday 
the hunger strikers who were packed into a modest living room 
said they feared the international popularity of president mikhail 
s gorbachevs reforms known as perestroika diverts attention 
from their plight 
we are very afraid now because the soviet union does everything 
possible to attract attention to perestroika and many people across 
the world are deceived said judith lurie of moscow 
its true that many changes have taken place in this country 
but its far from being a lawgoverned state said lurie 46 who 
has been refused an exit visa for 10 years 
luries family was given exit visas in 1979 but the authorites 
revoked them on the grounds of state secrecy because her husband 
worked in a classified job as a organic chemistry researcher for two 
years in the 1960s she said 
at least 48 women and several children are taking part in the 
hunger strike in nine cities including leningrad kiev minsk riga 
and irkutsk said inna ioffe whose apartment was one of two 
gathering spots in moscow for the hunger strikers 
the women in her apartment shared the details of their cases 
dried each others tears and wrote letters to first ladies barbara 
bush and raisa gorbachev to ask their support 
about half of the hunger strikers have been denied exit visas on 
the grounds of secrecy ioffe said the soviets have told them they 
cannot leave because they or a relative have been exposed to state 
secrets she said 
the other half known as poor relatives have been denied 
permission to leave because their parents or divorced spouses have 
failed to certify they have no financial claims on the wouldbe 
emigrants she said 
one hunger striker was joined in the fast by her twin 13yearold 
daughters the family has not been allowed to emigrate to israel 
because the girls father refuses to sign the necessary forms 
our former father cast us off when i was 5 years old we 
havent seen him since and hes absolutely uninterested in us but 
when mom applied to emigrate he called and said he loves us very 
much said vicka prilutskaya one of the twins 
our father says while he lives he wont let us go said the 
teenager who wore a star of david around her neck and an israeli 
flag pin on her sweater 
tamara gurfink 56 sobbed as she told her story 
my only son emigrated to new york and i havent seen him in 
nine years said gurfink as she pulled two photos of her son out 
of her wallet 
i ask only to be allowed to go and be a guest of my son but i 
am refused said gurfink who said she has not been allowed to 
leave on the grounds of state secrecy 
the participants said they hope the hunger strike will encourage 
the international community to pressure soviet leaders to write laws 
forcing officials to deal with cases individually and be more just 
ioffe said she has been told she cannot emigrate because her 
76yearold motherinlaw who also wants to emigrate was exposed 
to state secrets in her work as a botanist 
more than 20000 soviet jews were allowed permission to emigrate 
in 1988 which was an eightyear high the highest exodus 51328 
was recorded in 1979 
its difficult to estimate how many soviet jews have been denied 
exit visas the council for soviet jewry a group sponsored by the 
israeli government estimates the number at 3600

soviet jews had their applications for exit visas refused last year 
and there are new refuseniks

just received her notice of refusal tuesday

the louisiana legislatures approval of 
gov buddy roemers tax increase plan sets up an april 29 vote on a 
constitutional amendment to overhaul a system dating to the populist 
huey long era 
legislators adopted the proposal tuesday at a special session 
roemer called to address a projected budget shortfall of 654 
million for the next fiscal year 
state revenue has fallen sharply because of louisianas oilbust 
recesssion and its unemployment rate of more than 11 percent the 
nations highest 
rep david duke the former klan leader recently elected as a 
republican from a new orleans suburb promised to lead opposition to 
roemers program 
i dont care what the american nazi party thinks about this 
program the governor responded on monday duke apologized to the 
house for being photographed shaking hands with an official of the 
american nazi party 
how can you dare not call this a tax increase duke shouted 
at administration floor leaders during house debate how can you 
say that income taxes will be increased by 165 million and thats 
not a massive tax increase 
the roemer administration has depicted the plan as a reform 
program providing a net increase in revenue of 25 million over 
current levels current revenue includes a oneyear 500 million 
sales tax increase that expires june 30 
the roemer proposal would make much of that increase permanent 
along with some tax breaks and an increase in income taxes 
roemers program also includes a 4cent gasoline tax increase to 
pay for a 15 billion improvement program for highways airports 
and ports 
for both the highway improvement program and the tax code 
revision to go into effect a majority of voters must approve a 
constitutional amendment april 29 
last year louisiana had to sell longterm bonds to pay off an 
accumulated deficit of about 900 million 
roemers initial attempt to revise the tax system failed before 
the legislature in october over his proposal to lower the states 
75000 homestead tax exemption the governor did not touch the 
exemption in his latest package

in a move approved by secretary of state james 
a baker iii three members of the palestine liberation organization 
will be permitted to enter the united states to attend a conference 
at columbia university the state department said wednesday 
none of the three has any record of personal involvement in 
terrorism spokesman charles e redman said in announcing the bush 
administration would waive a 1974 law that generally prohibits the 
issuance of visas to the plo based on a judgment that the 
organization engages in terrorism 
the israeli embassy reacted swiftly and negatively we regret 
the decision by the us government to grant visas to 
representatives of a terrorist organization and have expressed this 
position to the administration spokesman yossi gal said 
the conference scheduled friday through sunday in new york is 
sponsored by new outlook an israeli magazine and by the east 
jerusalem palestinian newspaper al fajr several leftwing 
members of the israeli knesset or parliament also are to attend 
redman said the state department recommended issuance of the 
visas to the three palestinian arabs nabil shath noha nicholas 
tadros and afif safyah and that the justice department concurred 
he said baker was involved in the recommendation 
all three palestinians have attended academic conference in the 
past with us permission the spokesman said 
under the law being waived in this case yasser arafat chairman 
of the palestine liberation organization was denied a visa last 
year to participate in a mideast debate at the united nations the 
move recommended by thensecretary of state george p shultz 
evoked criticism from un officials and arab and west european 
governments 
that conference was shifted to geneva where arafat issued 
statements urged on him by the state department renouncing terrorism 
in all forms affirming israels right to exist and accepting un 
security council resolutions that all countries in the middle east 
should be able to live peacefully within secure borders 
this led to a decision by shultz and thenpresident reagan in 
december to drop a 13year ban and open talks with the plo five 
meetings have been held in tunisia with us ambassador robert 
pelletreau 
three attacks by plo guerrillas on israeli positions in southern 
lebanon since then were sharply criticized by baker and spokesman 
redman in the meantime the dialogue is being continued

public opposition to building new nuclear power 
plants is due mainly to ignorance of the nations needs not concern 
about reactor accidents a nuclear industry leader said wednesday 
harold b finger president of the us council for energy 
awareness made the comment coincidentally as officials at a north 
carolina nulear plant announced they had shut down a reactor after a 
small amount of radioactive steam was released into the air 
officials at the mcguire nuclear plant near charlotte declared 
an alert the secondleast serious of four emergency categories 
and said the release of radioactivity was caused by a pipe leak 
they said there was no danger to the public 
finger whose group promotes nuclear power spoke at a news 
conference to present a paper on the future of the industry he said 
that unless atomic plants are built in the 1990s the nation would 
face electricity shortages 
no orders to build nuclear reactors have been placed since 1978 
and some utility officials say its unlikely any more plants will be 
built in this century 
while acknowledging there is a general concern about nuclear 
energy among the public finger said the main reason people oppose 
building nuclear plants in their area is doubt about the need for 
more electrical generating capacity 
the american public does not know were headed into this period 
of very serious electricity need finger said 
finger said the publics views on nuclear power are not 
influenced greatly by publicity about accidents and safety 
violations at atomic reactors such as the shutdown of the two peach 
bottom reactors in pennsylvania in march 1987 after control room 
workers were caught sleeping on the job 
environmental groups opposed to nuclear power point to incidents 
such as peach bottom and the less serious pipe leak at mcguire on 
wednesday as reasons to expect the public to continue opposing the 
building of new nuclear plants 
these kinds of mishaps some more serious than others continue 
to erode public confidence in commercial nuclear power plants 
scott denman director of the antinuclear safe energy communication 
council said in a telephone interview 
public opinion on nuclear power also has been hurt by recent 
publicity about lax safety standards and environmental hazards at 
energy department reactors that produce material for nuclear 
weapons said james j oconnor chairman of commonwealth edison co 
of chicago all of the government reactors have been shut down 
temporarily because of safety technical and managerial problems

pope john paul ii encouraged us roman 
catholic bishops wednesday to proclaim church teaching even if it is 
unpopular they responded that authoritarianism does not convince 
americans 
the views were voiced at the start of a special fourday 
conference of 35 american bishops the pontiff summoned to rome 
dissent from church teaching in the united states has raised 
concern in the vatican which considers the 52 millionmember 
american church critical because of its size wealth and potential 
to set worldwide trends 
john paul described the bishops as pillars who give the 
church strength and the bishops role is expected to dominate the 12 
hours of discussions with top vatican officials through saturday 
he spoke briefly in english to the prelates who were gathered 
with vatican officials in the old synod hall the meeting was closed 
but his remarks were made public 
i wish to encourage you in your ministry john paul said i 
am fully conscious of the challenges you face in bringing the gospel 
message to a world that does not often readily accept it 
your people experience the difficulties of being christians in 
todays world yet at the same time they search for direction in 
following the path marked out by christ 
responding to the pope archbishop john l may of st louis 
president of the us national conference of catholic bishops took 
up the theme of american democracy raised earlier in the day by 
cardinal joseph bernardin of chicago 
authoritarianism is suspect in any area of learning or 
culture in america may said individual freedom is prized 
supremely religious doctrine and moral teaching are widely judged 
by these criteria 
therefore to assert that there is a church teaching with 
authority binding and loosing for eternity is truly a sign of 
contradiction to many americans who consider the divine right of 
bishops as outmoded as the divine right of kings he said 
accordingly bishops live and work constantly in this atmosphere 
cardinal joseph ratzinger west german head of the powerful 
congregation for the doctrine of the faith addressed the meeting on 
the bishop as teacher of the faith cardinal john oconnor of 
new york was speaking on the issue for the americans 
both sides emphasized the nonconfrontional nature of the 
meeting but a conflict arose immediately over releasing speeches by 
the bishops and officials public 
meetings of the us church hierarchy in washington are open to 
the media and the rev kenneth doyle spokesman for the bishops 
said 
my impression is that the american bishops would have no 
difficulty with having their presentations released to the press 
and in fact that is the way they are accustomed to functioning 
vatican officials apparently were resisting the idea however 
except for the opening addresses by john paul and may 
other topics to be covered include the family sacraments 
christian education and the media 
the vatican has been troubled by dissent among americans on such 
issues as the church ban on contraception and remarriage for 
divorced people there also have been calls for women to be have a 
greater role in church decisionmaking but the pope has said 
repeatedly that women cannot become priests 
john paul says people cannot dissent from church teaching and be 
considered good catholics and during his 1987 visit to the 
united states he challenged the bishops on the issue 
at a news conference wednesday bernardin said american 
democratic freedoms are not in conflict with our faithfulness to 
the universal catholic tradition that is ours 
our experiences like those of every national hierarchy are 
rooted in that dual reality the gospel which is universal and one 
as proclaimed in a particular cultural and societal setting 
bernardin said 
he said it is important to share these experiences with the 
pope and his advisers just as it is for the americans to be aware 
of their convictions and insights from the perspective of the 
universal church

on march 25 ants paju will mark the 
40th anniversary of the day he was placed on a train as a boy and 
deported to siberia 
the next day the bearded 44yearold journalist will stand 
against a top official for the right to represent central estonia in 
a new parliament in moscow 
in the small baltic republics the cracks between russians and 
ethnic balts and between the communist party and the reformminded 
peoples front are widening as the election draws near 
paju editor of the nature magazine eesti loodus is running 
against the head of the estonian state agriculturalindustrial 
complex gustav tonspoeg on a platform that mixes environmental and 
economic issues with the spiritual renewal activists say is crucial 
to the survival of tiny estonia 
the worse the internal state of people the greater the 
possibilities of doing terrible things to our environment paju 
said in an interview 
paju is the son of an estonian peasant who also was deported to 
siberia and died there after the soviet union took control of the 
baltic republic in 1940 he was put on a train with a woman he did 
not know his mother was required to remain in estonia and sent 
to siberia until after josef stalin died in 1953 
now he hopes to become a member of the 2250member congress of 
peoples deputies which president mikhail s gorbachev says must 
help turn the soviet union into a nation governed by laws rather 
than personal dictate 
estonia has gone further than latvia and lithuania in asserting 
its independence from moscow declaring its sovereignty nov 16 
although moscow rejected that claim the two sides have managed to 
avoid an open conflict however estonia has not backed down 
estonian activists say that in contrast to the other baltic 
republics their communist party and government leadership strongly 
support the grassroots peoples front political movement striving 
for autonomy from moscow 
candidates such as paju and scientist endel littmaa 58 have 
appeared to push the peoples fronts program 
without criticizing everything left and right its unlikely 
youll be elected said littmaa 
rifts have appeared between ethnic estonians who make up about 
60 percent of the population and russians who comprise the rest 
russians fear that decisions making estonian the official 
language restoring the national flag of the estonian republic and 
moves for economic selfsufficiency will make them secondclass 
citizens 
just as ethnic estonians rallied around the peoples front 
russians have joined a new organization called interfront the 
newspaper sovietskaya estonia said that of the 742 delegates seated 
for its organizing convention last weekend 572 were russians only 
11 were ethnic estonian 
an estonian journalist tarmu tammerk said the march 26 
balloting is more likely to break down on ethnic lines than party 
versus peoples front 
reports in tallinn said interfront was organizing a general 
strike for march 14 the republics reformminded communist party 
chief vaino vyalyas went on radio and television tuesday to appeal 
for calm and reject extremism 
but estonian activists pledge to fight on a plan designed to 
make staterun enterprises answer to tallinn rather than moscow 
ministries is likely to come before the legislature this month the 
plan is called ime an acronym that stands for economic 
selfgovernment in estonia but also means miracle in estonian 
in the latvian capital of riga latvians and russians also are 
split but the party apparatus led by janis vagris is wedged 
uneasily between the two 
latvia has the highest concentration of russians of any of the 
baltic republics about 50 percent and a twin of the estonian 
interfront the internationalist front is active 
vagris criticized it and the latvian peoples front in january 
both movements have some extremistminded elements he said 
both also involve members of the communist party which means that 
there is also stratification within the party 
latvian activists accuse vagris of tilting away from reforms by 
permitting criticism in the local press of the movement for the 
national independence of latvia a group that cooperates with the 
peoples front but seeks outright independence the partys central 
committee also called for punishment of latvian journalists for 
muckracking pieces it said whip up illfeelings between latvians and 
russians 
the russianlanguage daily sovietskaya latvia said tuesday that 
90 percent of the 96 candidates for 40 seats in the march 26 
election were party members 
but that may be of little comfort to vagris the paper also said 
75 percent of the candidates are ethnic latvians and peoples front 
officials say roughly 75 percent support its aims 
lithuanias sajudis or peoples front has come in for the 
sharpest criticism from the communist party which accused it last 
month of crossing over from support for the party to clear 
opposition in some cases 
in a document dated feb 24 the grassroots organization said the 
election campaign was making some party and economic officials 
fearful for their posts and privileges 
but it also moved to bolster the lithuanian party leadership 
which it views as reformminded 
alvydas medalinskas a top sajudis spokesman said the 
organization had withdrawn candidates running against lithuanian 
party chief algirdas brazauskas and his deputy vladimir beriozov 
leaving them unopposed he said sajudis wanted to strengthen them 
against a stalinist wing of the lithuanian party

top managers of the us postal service have an 
idea for lopping at least 2 billion off the federal deficit next 
year remove the agency from the budget 
if we stay on budget it will increase the general deficit by 
over 2 billion taking us off will avoid that robert setrakian 
chairman of the agencys governing board said wednesday 
the postal service does not belong in the unitary budget 
agreed postmaster general anthony frank at a jount meeting of two 
subcommittees of the house committee on post office and civil 
service 
much of the house appears to agree with committee members 
reporting that they have more than 200 member signatures on a bill 
to move the agency back out of the federal budget 
i want to underscore the need for offbudget status 
said rep frank horton rny the subcommittee chairmen reps 
mickey leland dtexas and frank mccloskey dind concurred 
in pressing for removal from the general federal budget the 
postal service leaders appealed to the same logic that led to the 
agencys being included in the overall budget during the reagan 
administration 
once a heavily subsidized cabinet department the postal service 
was made an independent federal agency in 1971 the services 
subsidy was phased out and the agency was directed to operate like a 
business breaking even over the long haul and having its own 
budget 
over the years the agency developed a pattern of operating at a 
loss some years but making a profit in others depending on how 
recently rates had gone up but it did break even on average 
this was noticed by reagans office of management and budget and 
in 1985 the post office which had a 117 million surplus the year 
before was brought back into the federal budget in an effort to 
make the national deficit appear smaller 
the result however was that when the government found itself 
battling a massive deficit last year cuts were imposed on agencies 
including the postal service forcing delays in construction and 
closing down post offices across the country for a few days 
collecting and sorting mail on sundays has not yet been resumed 
because of the budget crunch 
the postal service is expected to complete the current fiscal 
year about 600 million in the black then fall into the red in 
fiscal 1990 adding 2 billion or more to the federal deficit if 
the agency isnt removed from the overall federal budget before then 
frank has said he anticipates having to raise postage rates in 
1991 to cover that loss although he commented at the hearing that 
he would like to stretch out the currrent system of seeking 
increases every three years the last rate hike was in 1988

republican party chairman lee atwater was 
portrayed wednesday as a victim of the political symbolism of willie 
horton the black convict atwater turned into a major issue against 
michael dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign 
atwater resigned tuesday night from the board of predominantly 
black howard university after students occupied the administration 
building to protest his appointment 
he masterminded the use of the willie horton issue to 
contribute to the rising antiblack sentiment of the american 
people said michael lewis a spokesman for the student group 
the vehemence of the student reaction against atwater raised 
questions of how successful the new gop chairman would be in 
achieving his goal of attracting black voters to the republican 
party 
however there also was a view that president bush has a very 
positive image among blacks far more positive than that of his 
party or its chairman 
the republican party as a whole has a pretty big image problem 
among blacks said linda f williams an analyst with the joint 
center for political studies an independent group that focuses on 
the black community 
it is viewed as either not interested in the problems of blcks 
or actually opposed to the advancement of blacks she said 
bush has had a pretty long history with some black 
leadership said ms williams people are willing to see bush as 
a moderate 
the president was flying to new york on thursday to be keynote 
speaker at a united negro college fund banquet 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters that 
president bush had no reaction to atwaters decision to remove 
himself from howards board of trustees when he defended atwaters 
presence on the board 
he hoped things would be worked out and they have been 
fitzwater said 
since becoming chairman of the republican national committee 
early this year atwater a south carolina native who was bushs 
campaign manager has met with scores of black leaders as he has 
traveled around the country 
he attended a commemorative service in atlanta on the anniversary 
of the birth of martin luther king jr an accomplished rhythm and 
blues guitarist atwater also has received widespread publicity 
performing with such black musicians as b b king 
not all blacks endorsed the action of the howard students 
alan keyes who was the republican candidate for the senate in 
maryland in 1988 called the howard protest an unjustified 
reaction on the part of the students 
keyes also disputed the contention that the willie horton ads 
were racist 
when i look at willie horton i see a criminal i dont see a 
black person he said 
horton was a convicted murderer who failed to return from a 
weekend furlough from prison in massachusetts and later raped a 
maryland woman the bush campaign used ads featuring the horton case 
to attack democrat dukakis as soft on crime 
many democrats including jesse jackson protested during the 
campaign that the horton ads were racist 
the signals that were sent in the willie horton ad were not so 
much about prison furloughs but about race inciting fears in 
white people and creating very painful feelings among 
africanamericans jackson said wednesday 
unfortunately lee atwater symbolizes the worst of that 
situation said jackson who called atwater tuesday night and urged 
him to resign from the board 
in his letter of resignation the gop chairman said he wanted to 
help the school but continuing the controversy surrounding my 
appointment any longer defeats that goal 
todays events at howard demonstrate the possibility that 
someone could be injured in the protest he said that i could 
not accept i would never forgive myself if someone was hurt in one 
of these episodes 
he feels this is an unjust situation said leslie goodman a 
spokesman for the republican national committee 
michelle stent director of the washington legislative office of 
the united negro college fund said the college fund has a very 
close and good relationship with the president and his family 
emphasizing that she was speaking as an individual and not for 
the fund ms stent said she could understand the students 
viewpoint because of the willie horton situation i dont 
agree with what mr atwater did personally but politics is politics 
and he did what he had to do to win 
but she added maybe students are bringing us back to reality 
that things have to be a little more honest

the soviets are expressing alarm over the spread of 
aids at home with the health minister calling it a threat akin to 
that posed by nuclear weapons 
the number of cases in the soviet union is expected to rise 
almost tenfold next year 
as recently as 1987 soviet officials dismissed aids as a largely 
western problem due to decadent sexual mores and drug use foreign 
ministry spokesman gennady i gerasimov called the disease a 
scourge of god for the downfallen morals in our world 
but now the daily newspaper izvestia says the alarming 
situation with aids demands rapid and decisive measures 
a long time ago some noted epidemiologists reported with 
certainty that this new 20th century plague would pass us by 
izvestia said tuesday but the rapidly increasing number of soviet 
cases shows aids is not somewhere over there in their country 
it is among our population the paper said 
the threat that we face is no less than the ecological bomb 
or nuclear weapons health minister yevgeny chazov was quoted by 
izvestia as telling a conference of soviet epidemiologists convened 
to discuss the disease 
in 1988 izvestia said 81 people in the soviet union were 
carriers of the aids virus by feb 1 it said 44 more cases were 
known and now the number of people infected exceeds 140 
its expected that next year there will be 1342 sick 
people izvestia said apparently referring to carriers of the 
virus rather than people actually suffering the symptoms of aids 
acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus that 
damages the bodys immune system leaving victims susceptible to 
infections and cancer it is spread most often through sexual 
contact needles or syringes shared by drug abusers infected blood 
or blood products and from pregnant women to their offspring 
izvestia said that of four soviets actually ill from aids three 
have died the soviet union reported its first aids death in 
october a 29yearold leningrad prostitute 
izvestia quoted chazov as telling the meeting that the kremlin 
ignored warnings that aids could become a national calamity 
chazov said health ministry workers tried many times to inform 
the government that the situation was menacing izvestia said 
but noted scientists dealing with the problem eliminated the 
acuteness of the question saying it was all a false alarm 
in articles that horrified many soviets newspapers reported in 
january that children at a maternity home in elitsa near the 
caspian sea had been infected with aids because of the multiple use 
of an unsterile syringe 
nurses at the hospital had been reusing disposable syringes to 
cover up the sale of unused needles to drug addicts the reports 
said 
so far 31 infected children in elitsa have been identified 
izvestia said and on average one more is detected every week 
just as soviets are not any more immune to aids than westerners 
some are also liable to treat its victims as pariahs izvestia said 
it seems recently we read about aids phobia the fear of 
getting aids in the usa the paper said we read and we 
shuddered apparently normal decent people were compelling a sick 
person to leave town they were burning down the house where he 
lived we told ourselves then well no thats impossible here 
but things proved that it is possible 
in the area around elitsa people throw rocks at cars with 
license plates from the region as if the cars were spreading 
aids soviet poet david kugultinov wrote in izvestia last month 
youngsters from the region are also being discriminated against he 
said 
the relationship of students leaving kalmykia to study in 
neighboring republics has sharply changed voices are calling out 
demanding to separate them from the dormitories kugultinov wrote 
he said his country should follow the example of the united 
states in seeking to prohibit discrimination against aids victims 
in the past 1 years the soviets have decreed measures designed 
to counter the spread of aids in 1987 it became a crime to infect 
someone else regulations announced this year require foreigners who 
want to stay in the country for more than three months to prove they 
are free from aids 
by western standards the soviets as of now have only a small 
problem with aids if the figures published by izvestia are 
accurate in comparison the number of aids victims in the united 
states had risen to 86157 as of feb 16 the world health 
organization said

victims of the bhopal gas disaster 
rampaged through union carbide corp offices wednesday and a human 
chain surrounded the building screaming killer carbide quit 
india 
hundreds of other protesting victims squatted outside the supreme 
court which wednesday began hearing a petition challenging the 
governments right to settle on compensation for all victims of the 
worlds worst industrial accident 
about 570000 people say they are entitled to compensation for 
the dec 3 1984 gas leak at a union carbide pesticide plant in the 
central town of bhopal that killed at least 3400 people and injured 
20000 today people still are dying from effects of the leak 
about a dozen people broke away from the protest outside the 
downtown new delhi offices of the danbury connbased multinational 
wednesday and stormed into the reception area 
they broke windows smashed furniture and scrawled slogans on the 
walls said company spokesman subramanium kumaraswamy 
about 140 demonstrators who formed a human chain around the 
building yelled we will not allow ucc to get away with murder 
the 10 employees in the reception area were unharmed during the 
20minute melee kumaraswamy said 
immediately the company sought police protection 
we have posted policemen all over a police official said on 
condition of anonymity what happened will not happen now 
protesters want the supreme court to scrap a 470 million 
settlement agreed to by the government feb 14 as full and final 
compensation for all sufferers from the disaster 
i am a gas victim said a yellow paper badge on the sari of a 
woman among 800 demonstrators who sat crosslegged in the parking 
lot of the supreme court 
the main gates of the court were locked and police and 
paramilitary troops searched everyone entering the building 
inside the court heard the petition of charanlal sahu 51 a 
supreme court lawyer who was in bhopal at the time of the gas leak 
sahu says his lungs and eyes still are affected by the exposure 
his lawyer rk garg argued the governments assumption of 
power to act for all victims is a denial of the fundamental rights 
to life and livelihood guaranteed by indias constitution 
garg argued passionately that the settlement challenged the 
concept of india as a free nation he said the government had 
erred in not holding union carbide liable 
hearings continue thursday before five judges who must decide 
whether they will admit the petition for review of the courts 
judgment which absolved union carbide of all civil and criminal 
liability 
chief justice raghunandan s pathak appointed the judges last 
week after one of five judges who ordered the feb 14 settlement 
quit the panel because of widespread criticism of the agreement 
opposition politicians newspapers and prominent citizens have 
accused the government of selling out to union carbide the 
government originally sued for 3 billion then settled for 470 
million 
union carbide deposited the entire amount with the court feb 24 
it is being held until the court rules on the petition

on an average day thousands of women worldwide 
are beaten in their homes by their partners thousands more are 
raped assaulted and sexually harassed 
these startling estimates are set forth in a new report by 
worldwatch institute a washingtonbased research group that 
maintains violence against women is a pervasive yet largely ignored 
problem that affects all societies and socioeconomic groups 
particularly in the indian subcontinent and africa 
if a person is murdered because of his or her politics the 
world justifiably responds with outrage but if a person is beaten 
or allowed to die because she is female the world dismisses it as 
cultural tradition writes lori heise a senior researcher at 
the institute 
over the last generation women in many countries have made long 
strides towards achieving equality these advances were highlighted 
at many gatherings wednesday on the occasion of the 79th annual 
international womens day a congressionally sanctioned observance 
held each march 8 
but as heise describes it the observances were small comfort 
for countless women for whom the mere fact of womanhood can pose 
extraordinary risks for them home sweet home is a cruel 
illusion 
in the united states says surgeon general c everett koop as 
many as 15 million women have been beaten raped or suffered other 
forms of physical and sexual assault with the number rising by 1 
million a year 
as hedy nuriel first vice chairman of the national coalition of 
domestic violence put it for many of us its safer to be out on 
the streets than to be in our own homes 
heise writing in world watch magazine says that 
internationally women tend to be targets because of their sex and 
that the violence occurs without social remorse or protest 
societies tacitly condone this violence through their silence 
or worse yet legitimize it through laws customs and court 
opinions that blatantly discriminate against women she says 
during a parliamentary debate in papua new guinea on whether 
wifebeating should be made illegal one participant williami wi 
was quoted as saying that the practice is an accepted custom 
we are wasting our time debating the issue 
in india heise writes countless women have died as a byproduct 
of the system in which a brides parents provide gifts to the groom 
as part of a marriage settlement 
murder suicide or severe abuse is sometimes the price young 
brides pay if promised money or goods do not materialize she says 
for a woman in bangladesh said ishrat shamin of the university 
of dhaka the choice is often between a violent home and none at all 
in that country separated deserted or divorced women are 
socially unacceptable she observes and remarriage is almost 
impossible 
to remedy the problem of violence heise says the most important 
step women can take is to recognize oppression and act together 
against it 
those battered or raped need to know they are not alone and 
society needs to know the extent of womens victimization she 
says 
violence persists in part because it is hidden if governments 
and womens groups can expose its magnitude through surveys and 
better statistics then ignorance will no longer be an excuse for 
inaction

defense minister yitzhak 
rabin vowed wednesday to block illegal jewish settlements in the 
occupied lands after troops foiled attempts by rightwing activists 
to settle two sites 
in clashes with troops in the west bank and occupied gaza strip 
20 palestinians were shot including a 13yearold boy and a 
75yearold man arab hospital officials said 
the army confirmed two of the injury reports and said it was 
checking the others 
the army blocked two groups of wouldbe settlers who set out for 
the west bank tuesday night after a rally in tel aviv attended by 
about 10000 people 
eight activists from the rightwing betar youth movement pitched 
a tent on a hilltop about 15 miles east of tel aviv where the 
settlement of ofarim is to be built said a defense ministry 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity 
the activists pulled up stakes after soldiers told them to leave 
the official said on wednesday soldiers guarding the site told 
reporters it was a closed military area 
other wouldbe settlers drove three mobile homes from the rally 
to the beit horon settlement north of jerusalem and said they 
planned to move to the proposed new settlement of talmon later in 
the week 
the defense ministry official said the group canceled its plans 
after failing to receive government permits but photographers said 
troops stopped the group as it tried to drive to talmon tuesday 
night 
the government a coalition of the rightwing likud bloc and the 
leftofcenter labor party authorized the construction of eight new 
settlements including talmon and ofarim but has not granted final 
approval 
labor which favors some territorial concessions to resolve the 
arabisraeli conflict has tried to slow construction of settlements 
in the past the government has approved settlements erected 
illegally 
but rabin labors no 2 leader said we will not allow any 
settlements other than in accordance with the government decision 
and a long procedure which is set by the ministry of defense and 
other ministries related to the problem 
about 70000 jewish settlers live alongside 17 million 
palestinians in more than 130 settlements in the occupied lands 
the settlers want israel to maintain its control over the 
territories some claim the land was given by god to the people of 
israel in biblical times 
the united states says the settlements are obstacles to peace and 
opposes them 
palestinians staged a general strike wednesday to mark the end of 
the 15th month of their uprising against the israeli occupation the 
rebellion has claimed 391 palestinian and 17 israeli lives 
streets were deserted and stores shuttered in compliance with the 
strike call by the unified national leadership of the uprising an 
umbrella group consisting mainly of plo factions 
in the west bank town of bir zeit outlawed palestinian flags 
fluttered from electricity poles and arab activists piled up stones 
in the main road to block palestinians from going to work 
palestinian women staged proplo demonstrations in several towns 
and villages to mark international womens day 
about 600 women including israelis and palestinians marched 
peacefully along a major shopping street in tel aviv chanting 
israelpalestine and rabin how many children have you killed 
today 
in jerusalem police dispersed about 60 hebrew university 
students who marched to the isawiya neighborhood to show support for 
the residents israel radio reported 
isawiya has been put under curfew while police search for 
antiisraeli activists more than 30 arabs had been arrested the

when composer lee hoiby watched a videotape of 
television chef julia child whipping up a very special veeery 
choclately bittersweet loooovely cake he knew he had the 
recipe for a scrumptious musical treat 
his 20minute ode to miss childs chocolate cake with lyrics 
taken verbatim from the tape of a tv cooking lesson in 1961 had its 
world premiere wednesday at the kennedy center 
the musical monologue entitled bon appetit after miss 
childs familiar closing line featured actress jean stapleton 
singing her way around an imaginary kitchen flouring cake pans and 
beating egg whites in pantomime to hoibys piano accompaniment 
bon appetit was served up as the dessert course for an 
evening of hoibys meatandpotatoes classical fare then at a 
postconcert reception the audience was invited to sample the real 
thing le gateau au chocolat leminence brune prepared from miss 
childs recipe by the kennedy centers head chef 
hoiby and miss stapleton will repeat their musical cake bake 
which is scored for small orchestra during a festival of the 
composers music at long beach calif later this month and at 
santa fe nm on april 9 
hoiby confessed that his work on bon appetit was a severe 
test of his commitment to a macrobiotic diet which features such 
ultrahealthy foods as cabbage brown rice and fish with seaweed 
i am tempted not only by the lyrics but by the cake itself 
he said in a prerehearsal interview 
i often give in to temptation and say ill make up for it 
later he said i love chocolate cake the things that are out 
of reach are what we love in this world 
the 63yearold composer who lives and works on a 40acre farm 
in the catskills of new york state wrote the piece as a 
curtainraiser for performances of a longer operatic version of the 
late ruth drapers monologue the italian lesson which he 
composed for miss stapleton in 1984 
hoiby and associate mark shulgasser liked the idea of using the 
script of a julia child cooking lesson and had miss stapleton write 
the tv chef for permission she happily agreed sent along a batch 
of tapes and suggested her recipe for chicken marengo 
but hoiby thought chocolate cake was a tastier choice 
she gets pretty carried away about everything but especially 
this dessert hoiby said 
during four full days of watching miss childs tapes hoiby was 
intrigued by the rhapsodic phrases and musical metaphors in miss 
childs speech as she banged pots whisked egg yolks into a yellow 
ribbon and poured out her creamy chocolate batter with a spatula 
her speaking patterns really grab you the phraseology the 
unexpected little interjections hoiby said there is a kind of 
musical cadence in her speech which one isnt aware of unless one 
starts to set it to music and then there it is 
miss stapleton a veteran of broadway musicals who is better 
known as archie bunkers wife edith on the all in the family 
tv series agrees 
what i love is her wonderful sense of theater the actress 
said of the chef shes not just a cook shes a character very 
rich and very humorous 
miss stapleton makes the most of miss childs comic touches 
tapping an invisible cake pan and instructing her audience to 
knock out the flour on the floor if you have a selfcleaning 
kitchen like mine 
the music accelerates when she beats egg whites in an unlined 
copper bowl in a frantic race with an electric mixer were going 
to see who wins she sings and i think maybe ill win 
because im bigger 
next time if there is one miss stapleton says shed like to 
collaborate with hoiby on the chicken recipe 
chickens are always funny she said with a laugh

an iraqi ambush killed five iranian 
soldiers last month despite a ceasefire in the eightyear war 
between the nations irans un ambassador said wednesday 
also on wednesday a senior iraqi foreign ministry official 
riyad alkassy arrived at un headquarters for discussions with 
officials on coming peace talks between the foreign ministers of 
iran and iraq 
iranian ambassador mohammed jaafar mahallati said he learned of 
the troop deaths from the un iraniraq military observer group 
which has monitored the ceasefire since it went into effect aug 20 
un undersecretarygeneral marrack goulding the chief 
peacekeeper received reports from his officers that five iranian 
soldiers had been shot in the back and killed feb 17 said un 
spokeswoman nadia younes 
iran said that they had been killed in an iraqi ambush 
however the investigation by peacekeeping observers could not 
confirm this she said 
mahallati discussed the deaths in a letter to secretarygeneral 
javier perez de cuellar that said iraqi forces ambushed our 
patrols near baneh about 20 miles from the border and about 310 
miles west of tehran a communications operator was captured 
mahallati said 
perez de cuellar reported feb 2 that the worst violence on the 
740mile front line occurred dec 11 in the southern border region 
near the shattalarab waterway dividing iran and iraq 
two iranians were killed in that clash which involved artillery 
rocket and smallarms fire 
the armies are separated by only a few dozen yards in many 
places and in one spot face each other across 30 yards of desert 
perez de cuellar said last month 
the only previous report of a fatality on the front came just 
hours after the ceasefire took effect perez de cuellars report 
did not confirm irans claim that iraqi gunfire killed a soldier in 
that case 
peace talks between iran and iraq have been deadlocked since they 
began aug 25 
they are to resume in new york in late march or early april with 
a meeting of foreign minister ali akbar velayati of iran and his 
iraqi counterpart tariq aziz 
last week iranian foreign ministry officials met with un 
officials to present their views on the talks 
iraqi president saddam hussein proposed sunday that the nations 
exchange all 100000 prisoners of war under the geneva convention 
which calls for the repatriation of prisoners after active 
hostilities cease 
the exchange would be separate from the peace talks to allow for 
progress even if the negotiations remain deadlocked he said 
the talks became deadlocked when iran demanded that iraq withdraw 
its troops from 260 square miles of iranian territory 
iraq refused and countered that iran must relinquish its right to 
search ships in international waters for weapons bound for iraq 
iran has not searched any ships since the ceasefire took effect

text of statement issued by the 
revolutionary justice organization as translated from arabic by the 
associated press 
in the name of the almighty 
after a thourough reading of the satanic verses book and its 
contents that insult islam and the arab prophet and after examining 
the study of the socalled salman rushdie the revolutionary justice 
organization declares that it has completed its preparations to 
execute the just sentence issued by the esteemed cleric and the 
great struggler ayatollah khomeini against salman rushdie hence it 
puts forward the following evidence for carrying out the sentence 
1 insulting islam and the arab prophet is an insult to the 
latest and greatest human civilization represented by revolutionary 
islam 
2 salman rushdies record indicates that he was a branch member 
of the freemasons movement in england immediately after the 
publication of his satanic verses book he was promoted to full 
official membership of the freemasons highest council in england 
or the church of organized atheism which combats divine religions 
especially christianity and islam and their great prophets 
3 imam ayatollah khomeini with his acute awareness of the 
grave consequences against the future of the divine religions 
emanating from this freemasonic and zionist attack has handed down 
his verdict when the arabs and those who claim to be the protectors 
of islam and speak for all the moslems remained in tight silence 
the revolutionary justice organization also declares that before 
taking any measures it will find itself compelled to attack british 
police posts assigned to protect salman rushdie in order to get to 
him to carry out the sentence we hold the british government 
responsible in advance for the human and material losses among the 
british police and their posts that could result from the attacks on 
them this warning applies to all countries that are currently 
negotiating with the british government to extend asylum and 
protection to rushdie 
victory to the oppressed 
glory and immortality to the martyrs

sen lloyd bentsen dtexas announced today he 
will vote to confirm former texas sen john tower as secretary of 
defense but senate majority leader george mitchell said he said he 
still had the votes to defeat the nomination 
bentsen the 1988 democratic vice presidential candidate became 
the third democratic senator to break party ranks and thow his 
weight behind the embattled nominee 
we have seen every imperfection in an essentially good man 
dragged into the pitiless glare of television lights bentsen 
said it has been a high price to pay for public service i will 
vote for john towers confirmation 
mitchell told reporters earlier in the day that no matter what 
decision bentsen made the democrats still have ample votes to 
reject confirmation he urged republicans to permit a swift vote 
but gop leader bob dole declared we dont want to prolong the 
debate we want to win 
dole did not directly dispute mitchells claim were not 
certain he said its going to be a very close vote 
bentsen who served in the senate with his fellow texan said he 
was impressed with towers pledge not to drink if confirmed to head 
the pentagon 
i doubt that john tower could get by with putting an olive in a 
glass of milk the scrutiny of his life is going to be so intense 
that he may wish he had never sought out this job bentsen said 
sen claiborne pell dri who had been listed by some 
republicans as a potential swing vote announced earlier that he 
will vote against tower because he has come to believe the 
relationships tower forged with defense contractors after leaving 
government service pose at least the appearance of conflict of 
interest 
in this case i do believe its in the nations best interests 
for the president to make another choice pell said 
the associated press survey indicates 48 democrats and republican 
larry pressler of south dakota as either firmly opposed to the 
nomination or leaning in that direction and 40 republicans and 
three democrats either firmly in favor or leaning that way 
dole rkan said he had talked by telephone earlier today with 
president bush who continues to support tower he said he would 
continue the effort to attract enough republicans and democrats to 
support the nomination 
dole and mitchell thus set the stage for a fifth day of debate on 
the nomination which has produced frayed tempers and unusual 
personal outbursts on both sides of the struggle 
i know this debate has been longer than most but this is 
unprecedented we dont want to prolong the debate we want to 
win dole told reporters 
mitchell was asked if he is disturbed that the senate may be 
damaged by the debates increasingly bitter and personal tone 
yes i am he replied i think the way to end it is to vote 
letters are coming in saying enough is enough this has gone on 
too long 
i believe enough time has been devoted to this matter 
mitchell said 
republicans now hope to convert other undecided democrats 
concentrating their efforts on a handful of lawmakers these include 
sens joseph lieberman dconn charles robb dva and bennett 
johnston dla 
mitchell told the senate today that the central focus of the 
debate is the claim by republicans that tower should be approved 
because the president is entitled to have his own man 
but he said tower himself while serving in the senate 
repeatedly voted against presidential nominees simply because he 
disagreed with some of their positions 
mitchell suggested many senators of both parties have reversed 
position on the proper stance to take on nominees because of the 
shift of the political winds 
i predict that if ever and when there is a democratic president 
they republicans will reverse position again he said 
do not get locked into your present views mitchell said 
you may be holding another view very soon 
at the white house sen alan simpson rwyo the deputy gop 
leader said after a meeting with bush that an excellent 
opportunity remains to pick up the democratic votes needed to push 
the nomination over the top 
there isnt any question in my mind that we indeed have the 
opportunity to get him confirmed simpson told reporters 
dole left open the possibility of asking the senate to permit 
tower to answer the allegations against him from the floor of the 
chamber 
but democrats said that would set an awful precedent for 
future confirmation battles and dole appeared to concede he would 
make that move only as a last resort 
mitchell called it a desperation tactic 
i do believe enough is enough he said why will the 
proponents of the nomination not permit a vote 
democrats control the senate by a 5545 margin 
on tuesday sen christopher dodd dconn recalling towers 
vote against the senate censure of his father for improper use of 
campaign funds 22 years ago said he would vote for confirmation 
dodd said that although he and his family will be eternally 
grateful for towers defense of the late sen tom dodd dconn 
his decision did not rest on personal considerations 
he said that reading the file of the fbi investigation into 
towers past he believes evidence is too thin to support a vote to 
bar the former texas senator from becoming defense secretary 
that evidence involves allegations many of them disputed that 
tower drank excessively displayed improper behavior toward women 
and permitted the appearance of conflict of interest to develop in 
the lucrative links he forged with giant defense contractors after 
leaving government service 
dodds decision to support tower follows that of sen howell 
heflin dala together they dilute what had been a solid party line 
split for and against the nomination

foreign ministers of 35 nations ended a 
threeday meeting wednesday and stressed that a new round of arms 
talks should focus on increasing trust as well as reducing weapons 
the talks opening thursday could clear europe of many of the 
troops and conventional weapons massed between the atlantic and the 
urals in the four decades since the cold war 
nato proposed the talks focus first on imbalances and reductions 
in tanks artillery and armored personnel carriers it says the 
warsaw pact has a 21 edge in such weapons 
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze proposed broader 
talks saying he wants existing imbalances removed and then a 10 
percent to 15 percent cut in troops and all kinds of weaponry 
including combat airplanes over the next two to three years 
yugoslavia which is not a member of either military bloc on 
wednesday backed shevardnadzes proposal 
nato says it wants to focus first on the tanks and other weapons 
that could be used in a surprise land attack 
shevardnadze on monday proposed huge cuts in troops and weapons 
and further talks to strip the continent of battlefield nuclear 
rockets 
but secretary of state james a baker iii and other western 
officials rejected the soviet suggestion hinting they viewed it as 
a ploy t

employees an action that gillette said indicated strong faith in 
the future of the business a wage increase scheduled to take effect 
next fall also will be deferred the plan calls for the workers to

half is to be returned next february

the state department said wednesday it has no 
evidence a japanese aerospace company installed equipment at a 
suspected libyan chemical weapons plant while president bushs 
spokesman said all aspects of the plant are being investigated 
the detroit news had reported that mitsubishi heavy industries 
had a team of 50 technicians and engineers at the complex in the 
desert south of tripoli 
the company is also involved in a proposed joint venture with the 
united states to build a jet fighter the fsx the deal was 
negotiated during the reagan administration and is now under review 
by the bush administration with a decision imminent 
despite the state department denial the report on alleged 
involvement by the japanese company in libya raised new concerns in 
congress about the proposed joint venture and an administration 
official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that 
although indications earlier in the week appeared to favor us 
approval of the jet fighter project within the past few days 
prospects had become very fluid 
as a result a final recommendation by the defense department and 
commerce department to president bush may not be ready by a friday 
deadline suggested by the white house the official said 
state department spokesman charles redman told reporters that 
news stories of a japanese company being involved with the libyan 
plant surfaced last summer and that the japanese government informed 
american authorities at the time that it had received assurances 
further japanese involvement was not contemplated 
those assurances are still valid redman said 
earlier wednesday white house press secretary marlin fitzwater 
said the administration is investigating all aspects of the 
plant 
fitzwater while declining to comment directly on the story said 
the plant is the matter of the utmost concern to the united states 
and we have raised it in any number of forums 
meanwhile rep mel levine dcalif a member of the house 
foreign affairs committee and a critic of the proposed joint venture 
with mitsubishi called for bush to delay his decision 
in light of recent press allegations we strongly urge that 
the decision on the plan to sell technology to mitsubishi for the 
development of the fsx aircraft be put on hold until this new matter 
is thoroughly investigated levine said in a letter to bush 
if mitsubishi heavy industries was in fact involved in the 
chemical weapons facility it would raise very serious questions 
about proceeding with the fsx agreement under which billions of 
dollars of sensitive american defense technology would be 
transferred to mitsubishi levine said 
the detroit news quoting unidentified congressional and defense 
department sources said japanese experts had installed 
metalmachining equipment used to make bomb canisters for poison gas 
fitzwater said the matter was raised briefly during a morning 
meeting between bush and congressional republican leaders 
it is being looked into from all aspects by our intelligence 
services and investigative bodies fitzwater said he said so far 
the investigations had yielded no conclusions were willing to 
discuss at this point 
mitsubishi heavy industries is also involved in a proposed joint 
venture with the united states to build a jet fighter the socalled 
fsx the venture was negotiated during the reagan administration and 
is now under review by the bush administration with a decision 
imminent 
fitzwater asked whether the new allegations would affect a 
presidential decision on the fsx project said only that bush had 
not yet made a final decision on the project 
under the agreement general dynamics of the united states and 
mitsubishi heavy industries would join forces to build the jet 
fighters a version of the f16 
critics in congress have labeled the project an 8 billion 
giveaway of us high technology and have called on bush to cancel 
us participation 
the japanese government says it needs a final goahead from the 
united states by march 31 to get funds for the project into its 
current budget 
congressional sources who spoke on the condition of anonymity 
said that the administration has been expected to give the project 
the goahead but with some safeguards to make sure that sensitive 
us weapons technology is not transferred to the japanese 
the detroit news story said that the cia briefed members of the 
senate foreign relations committee on the mitsubishilibyan 
connection during a closeddoor meeting last week

the president of the steelworkers union and a 
steel executive called wednesday for extending steelimport 
restraints while a group of steel users called the curbs the 
worst possible form of protectionism 
a debate sponsored by the private economic policy institute 
brought together advocates and opponents of americas fiveyear 
voluntary restraint program which was negotiated by the reagan 
administration in 1984 and limits steel imports from 19 countries 
and the european community 
the import curbs expire sept 30 
president bush pledged just before he was elected to continue the 
restraints in some form but opponents of the plan believe they can 
make a case for ending it or at least shortening the extension to 
less than five years and reducing its scope 
there was no argument at wednesdays debate that the annual 
productbyproduct countrybycountry import ceilings have aided 
the steel industrys revival imports have been reduced to about 20 
percent of the us market and employment and profits were up last 
year over 1987 
the issue is whether the restraints are still necessary and to 
what degree they have harmed other sectors of the american economy 
patrick thompson chairman of a coalition of 1000 manufacturers 
that rely on steel products said the curbs have meant higher steel 
prices and poorer product availability 
instead of growth and profitability through competitiveness 
our steel industry has a circlethewagon strategy of limiting 
supply through trade protection in order to raise prices said 
thompson president of transmatic inc of holland mich 
but thomas graham president of the steel division of usx corp 
said most of his companys customers accept the need for continued 
import protection 
if we lacked customer support believe me we wouldnt be 
here graham said ninetyfive percent of our customers are with 
us 
the us industry says it lost 116 billion from 1982 to 1986 
the problem steelworkers president lynn williams said is that 
the conditions that spawned the restraints large subsidies by 
overseas governments to support steel firms have not changed 
just as we begin to catch up and were a long way the worst 
thing in the world would be to choke off this growth he said 
the us international trade commission has been investigating 
the effect of the ceilings on us steelconsuming industries its 
report later this year is expected to be an important part of the 
debate over whether the administration should keep the program 
intact in its present form

central americans fleeing their wartorn 
homelands have begun using smugglers to take them deep into the 
united states to evade tighter rules and heavier border patrols 
officials said wednesday 
other refugees out of money for bribes and payments say they 
can only wait and hope the us crackdown that began feb 21 will 
ease 
theres been a large increase in smuggling people said juan 
a garcia assistant chief of the us border patrol in mcallen 
texas theyve resorted to going through smugglers to see if 
theyre able to get them farther into the united states 
david trevino a supervisor of the border patrols intelligence 
unit said there are 1500 to 2000 central americans on the mexican 
side of the border waiting to cross up from 200 to 300 before the 
new policy went into effect 
until feb 21 refugees could enter the united states at 
brownsville texas the nearest us point to central america most 
applied for political asylum and lived in the united states until 
their status was determined 
but the us immigration and naturalization service said most 
refugees have experienced economic hardship and need not fear 
political persecution in an effort to stem the flow the ins began 
interviewing refugees as soon as they crossed the border 
in the first week the agency granted only 16 of 370 petitions 
for asylum and detained the others pending deportation proceedings 
the result was a backup in this town just south of brownsville on 
the rio grande as some central americans fled the threat of 
detention in the united states and others searched for a new and 
illegal way across the border 
trevino said smuggling cases detected in the area have doubled 
from four to eight a day most of the refugees are trying to reach 
houston from which they can travel to other parts of the united 
states 
a lot them are transported to just before a checkpoint and 
dropped off they walk around the checkpoint and are picked up on 
the other side garcia said the checkpoints are surrounded by 
farmland and garcia said its impossible to monitor all the river 
crossings 
meanwhile many central americans said that while crossing the 
river has become tougher paying smugglers to take them to other 
crossing points or further into the united states is not an option 
we came and weve found that we cant get in that there are 
new laws and now were trapped here without money and we cant 
cross said margarita saavedra 45 a nicaraguan at the casa juan 
diego a roman catholicrun shelter for the poor 
she said she had been waiting 13 days with her 80yearold 
mother they tried paying a smuggler 30 but the coyote 
abandoned them on a riverbank outside matamoros 
if we can well try again if not well go back to 
guatemala where they went after they first left nicaragua said 
her mother angela pena 
a nicaraguan woman named yolanda who refused to give her last 
name said she fled for several reasons she said she wasnt being 
paid enough for long hours at a child welfare center and was being 
harassed because of her friendship with a rebel leader fighting 
nicaraguas leftist government 
she left her husband and two children behind but took her 
12yearold son along because he is close to draft age 
a shelter worker said the shelters population had shot up to 60 
all but three central americans in recent days 
they are waiting for a better time to pass when there is less 
surveillance he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
he said 40 to 50 people also left the shelter this week saying 
they were going home mexican immigration authorities were not 
bothering the central americans he said 
at a small hotel in matamoros a 31yearold mexican who 
frequently takes people across the border said he was finding it 
very very difficult 
the man who spoke on condition of anonymity said the group of a 
dozen with him were all mexicans however members of the group 
spoke with central american accents and a hotel worker said they 
were hondurans 
many central americans identify themselves as mexicans so they 
will be returned to mexico and not be deported to their homelands 
the group said it was down to its last 150 asked about other 
border points such as tijuana 2000 miles away in baja calif 
the mexican said 
you know what it would cost to go to tijuana 110000 pesos 
about 47 he said he prefers taking people across in brownsville 
because its closer to jobs in the eastern united states 
were going to wait to see if they go to sleep he said of 
the border patrol and if not were going to cross and maybe 
theyll catch us

a german physicist and a pathbreaking scottish 
minister were named as 1989 cowinners wednesday of the worlds most 
valuable prize the templeton prize for progress in religion 
the prize this year is 435000 it was the first time the prize 
has been divided between two winners a spokesman said judges split 
in this 17th year of the award 
carl friedrich von weizsaecker 76 of starnberg germany near 
munich was cited for initiating talks between scientists and 
religious scholars and for research into links between physics 
cosmology and theology 
the rev george mcleod 92 of edinburgh scotland was named for 
his founding of the iona community an ecumenical center of prayer 
peacemaking and work 
the winners were announced at the church center for the united 
nations the prizes will be presented privately at buckingham palace 
in london may 10 and publicly in tokyo on june 10 
in statements mcleod said he would use half of the money for 
direct action against hunger and the other half for work for 
peace von weizsaecker said his share would go to furthering 
relationships between science and faith 
the founder of the prize american investment counselor john m 
templeton said the international panel of judges picks winners on 
the basis of their originality in advancing the love and 
understanding of god 
he said the prize is deliberately kept larger than others such 
as the nobel prizes in science and literature to indicate that 
progress in religion is more important than progress in any other 
field 
the accelerating discovery rate in natural sciences needs to be 
matched by mans spiritual progess and discovery he said

physics initiated talks in 1949 at the university of gottingen 
between longhostile disciplines of science and religion and later 
at other institutions 
mcleod a church of scotland clergyman started the innovative 
iona community on an island off the west coast of scotland in 1938 
and it has since become a muchvisited and influential center 
for its monastictype discipline mcleod set a simple fivefold 
rule of daily prayer and scripture study tithing peacemaking and

after three days of antichinese rioting official reports have 
put the death toll in the violence at 12 but tibetans say far more

western donors wednesday urged the 
government to end a sixyear civil war threatening thousands with 
starvation and canada said it will halt economic aid unless the 
government starts peace talks 
apparently responding to those and internal pressures prime 
minister sadek mahdi on wednesday sent his interior minister 
mubarak fadil mahdi to ethiopia for talks with the southern rebels 
but the move is unlikely to produce results the sudan peoples 
liberation army refused to talk to fadil mahdi on a recent similar 
mission because they maintain the government first must endorse a 
tentative peace agreement reached nov 16 
earlier wednesday mahdi told a conference in khartoum that his 
government welcomes a united nations call for a months ceasefire 
to permit delivery of emergency relief to more than 2 million people 
facing starvation in rebel and governmentheld parts of southern 
sudan 
the problem is whether we can get the other side to accept this 
temporary stop for relief efforts mahdi said 
he was speaking at a un conference of western donor countries 
and relief agencies organizing the 1377 million emergency 
operation 
so far 45 million has been pledged for food and medication 
mostly available in sudan 
the un operation aims at a massive deployment by air trains 
trucks and nile river barges to get to 165000 tons of relief 
supplies in the south before the rainy season starts in may and 
isolates the area for at least six months 
the rebels who want the mostly moslem government to grant 
political and economic reforms to the predominantly christian and 
animist south have hampered relief efforts by attacking planes and 
trains escorted by military personnel 
the united nations says 100000 people could die if the operation 
fails other relief officials say it could be 600000 
last year at least 250000 southerners died many isolated by 
the rainy season 
canadian ambassador frances miles filleul spoke bluntly at the 
opening of the twoday conference for donor countries and 
organizations for emergency relief operations 
in absence of a settlement and national reconciliation we will 
reconsider continuing our other assistance he said emphasizing 
canada would continue humanitarian aid 
filleul criticized the sudanese government for failing to carry 
through on a peace proposal negotiated in november between the 
rebels and the democratic unionist party then senior coalition 
partner in mahdis government 
later he told reporters canada would cut its economic aid unless 
the government took steps toward peace canada budgeted 56 million 
for sudan this year 375 million of it in emergency humanitarian 
aid 
japan the united states and the european community japan were 
among other participants that pledged to maintain humanitarian aid 
to sudan but did not refer to economic assistance 
the united states halted economic aid to khartoum in january 1988 
because the government owed 74 million in arrears on military and 
economic debts according to julia taft director of the us 
governments foreign disaster assistance program humanitarian aid 
amounting to 62 million was maintained between february 1988 and 
february 1989 she said 
there will never be an end to the suffering until there is 
peace taft said 
mahdi emphatically denied his government was using food as a 
weapon in the conflict an accusation also leveled at the rebels 
we want to dispel this wicked image of the government using 
food as weapons and being callous to the needs of its civilians 
said mahdi 
in a related development un officials in uganda said a cargo 
plane failed to arrive wednesday in entebbe delaying the start of a 
major airlift of food to the besieged southern sudanese town of juba 
peter matheson of the world food program said a c130 hercules 
chartered from the southern air transport co of miami fla 
apparently was having technical difficulties

participants in an interfaith conference on the 
middle east said wednesday the dialogue between the united states 
and the palestine liberation organization is off to a slow start but 
has given impetus to the idea of a palestinian state 
it is selfevident that there hasnt been much of a dialogue 
said rita hauser an international attorney who played a role in 
encouraging the united states to talk with plo leaders 
she said none of the discussions between the united states and 
the plo have been substantive 
this has given a great deal of concern to many of us because 
obviously the plo is getting very frustrated as are other people 
she said 
the bush administration has said that its policy on the middle 
east is under review in december the reagan administration decided 
to drop a 13year ban and open talks with the plo five meetings 
have been held in tunisia with us ambassador robert pelletreau 
ms hauser said she believes the united states government has 
signaled that it is not prepared to renounce the dialogue and is 
engaged in a fairly nuanced and sophisticated approach to the 
question in anticipation of a substantive dialogue 
rabbi arthur hertzberg a professor of religion at dartmouth 
college agreed that the contact with the plo has been modest 
but declared that no matter what may happen to it as diplomatic 
games of one kind or another are played once the united states has 
met with the plo a palestinian state exists 
when it will exist is a question of time but the meeting with 
the plo has to be understood in historic context as accepting the 
proposition on the american side that there is a national movement 
called the palestinians and that the plo are the people to talk 
with 
the twoday conference involving christians jews and moslems 
is sponsored by the us interreligious committee for peace in the 
middle east 
in a statement the committee said it supports the palestinian 
peoples right of selfdetermination including the option of an 
independent state in the west bank and gaza pledged to live in peace 
with israel 
a rival group the jewish committee on the middle east handed 
out a flier at the meeting saying that none of its members had been 
invited to participate although hertzberg and others who it said 
oppose its positions were among the speakers 
the jewish committee on the middle east said it favors an end to 
huge economic and military subsidies of israel by the united 
states it also said it is for mutual recognition between israel 
and the new state of palestine

the bush administration on wednesday defended 
its decision to bar mayors from panama cuba and nicaragua from 
attending a drug conference in new york saying none of these 
countries can be counted on to cooperate in drug control efforts 
the conference opened wednesday without the presence of the 
mayors of panama city havana and managua 
the americas mayors conference drugs and traffic will run 
through friday with daily panel discussions on various aspects of 
the drug problem it is cochaired by new york mayor edward i and 
mayor andres pastrana of bogota colombia 
koch criticized the administrations decision saying the 
conference represents an extraordinary opportunity for dialogue 
among public officials acutely affected by the drug problem 
the decision to bar the mayor of havana drew a sharp rebuke from 
rep charles rangel dny who said that cuban president fidel 
castro has indicated strong interest in cooperating on drugcontrol 
activities 
rangel chairman of the house select committee on narcotics abuse 
and control said in a telephone interview that the administration 
decision shows that drugs are not on the administrations foreign 
policy agenda despite strong public sentiment to the contrary 
but state department spokesman charles redman said the 
administration questions the seriousness of the three goverments 
to undertake antinarcotics cooperation with the us 
in each of these cases the mayors are in office with the 
sanction of the highest authorities in his or her government he 
said 
redman noted that normal travel in the united states by officials 
of the three countries has been suspended because of political 
differences each has with the united states this restriction must 
be waived to allow visits by officials from any of the countries 
redman noted that there have been several allegations of 
nicaraguan government involving in drug smuggling 
last month however nicaraguan officials offered to cooperate 
with the united states in curtailing drug trafficking through that 
country 
rangels optimistic assessment of cubas attitude was based on a 
december visit to havana in which he and other committee members met 
with castro 
at the time rangel said castro told the delegation he wants very 
much to cooperate with the united states and other latin american 
countries in interdicting shipments of drugs 
if they offer to cooperate we cant afford to say no rangel

britain announced wednesday it is expelling about 
30 iranians on security grounds because of irans death threat 
against novelist salman rushdie the government also warned britons 
to get out of lebanon 
the foreign office said the 150 britons in lebanon are under 
increased threat from kidnappers following irans severing of 
diplomatic relations tuesday with britain over rushdies novel 
the satanic verses 
three britons are among the 15 foreign hostages in lebanon 
an iranian newspaper kayhan international said the diplomatic 
break will leave its negative impact on the fate of the british 
hostages 
in beirut the revolutionary justice organization which holds 
two american hostages said it has completed plans to kill rushdie 
but will first attack british police to get to him 
rushdie a british citizen who was born into a moslem family has 
been in hiding since feb 14 when ayatollah ruhollah khomeini of 
iran sentenced him to death for writing the satanic verses 
rushdie is believed to be under police guard in britain 
in washington an fbi official said zealous iranian students 
in the united states pose the greatest threat toward publishers and 
others over the novel 
foreign secretary sir geoffrey howe said britain is expelling the 
iranians because of khomeinis refusal to revoke the death sentence 
we have therefore decided on security grounds a number of 
iranians must be required to leave this country howe told the 
house of commons we are keeping the activities of other iranians 
under very close review 
howe also announced britain ordered the closure of the iranian 
consulate in hong kong a british colony he said the staff had two 
weeks to leave 
using his strongest language since the controversy began howe 
called the iranian government a deplorable regime and did not 
rule out the possibility of ending all trade with iran saying we 
stand ready to take whatever action may be necessary in the light of 
events 
a break in economic ties would prevent britain from winning 
lucrative contracts to help irans postwar reconstruction estimated 
to cost 500 billion the move also comes at a time when iran had 
been seeking to expand its ties with the west 
government sources speaking on condition of anonymity said up 
to 30 iranians who are held to be close to the regime will be 
expelled soon there are about 25000 iranians in britain including 
2400 students 
iran severed relations with a week after demanding britain 
denounce rushdie and ban his novel which moslems say blasphemes 
islam 
kayhan international and another tehran newspaper abrar said 
iran may cut ties with nations that supported britain and recalled 
their envoys these include britains 11 european economic community 
partners as well as canada sweden and norway 
abrar also called for an end to economic ties with britain 
british officials said prime minister margaret thatchers 
government has no plans to stop trade with iran but one senior 
official said if the iranians want to start a trade war we 
reckon they would lose 
in beirut lebanon the british embassy advised britons not to 
travel to lebanon as a result of the issue of author salman 
rushdie it urged those in the country to leave as soon as 
possible 
the warning was broadcast by the christianrun voice of lebanon 
radio 
the british hostages anglican church envoy terry waite 
journalist john mccarthy and teacher brian keenan all are 
believed held by proiranian shiite moslems 
the proiranian revolutionary justice organization which holds 
americans edward austin tracy and joseph james cicippio said 
wednesday it has completed its preparations to execute the just 
sentence issued by khomeini 
the revolutionary justice organization also declares that 
before taking any measures it will find itself compelled to attack 
british police posts assigned to protect salman rushdie in order to 
get to him the statement added it was accompanied by a 
photograph of tracy but it did not threaten hostages 
a foreign office spokesman said britain took the threat seriously 
i dont think we can do more than remain in a state of 
preparedness rushdie will continue to have the full protection of 
the law he said speaking on condition of anonymity 
an fbi investigator oliver buck revell told a congressional 
hearing thousands of zealous iranians in the united states 
illegally or on student visas could be a bigger threat than those 
known to have links to terrorist networks 
this is because they are not monitored and because the state 
departments standards for issuing visas are lax he told the senate 
foreign relations subcommittee on terrorism

an idaho businessman complained to congress 
wednesday that staff members of the consumer product safety 
commission had used heavyhanded tactics in trying to ban his only 
product a metal wormharvesting probe that uses electric currents 
philip a dye of caldwell idaho told the consumer protection 
subcommittee of the house energy and commerce committee that agency 
staff members also had acted in an underhanded fashion in their 
investigation of his product and had refused to discuss possible 
safety improvements 
his problems he said showed that members of the commission 
should be equipped with business knowledge and experience and 
most of all what is lacking now common sense 
a safety commission spokesman declined substantive comment but a 
commission member defended the agencys effort to get the product 
off the market suggesting the device probably is against every 
known product standard in the civilized world 
dye and his wife operate p amp m enterprises producing the worm 
gettr a device to drive worms to the earths surface 
it is made up of two six or 12 metal prongs inserted into the 
ground and connected to a common twowire 120volt ac household 
circuit the current flowing into the ground forces worms desired by 
fishermen to rise to the surface 
dye says no one has been killed or injured from the 30960 probes 
he had sold at prices ranging up to 2995 since starting the 
business six years ago and only one person had been known to 
receive a shock 
however the commission staff citing 20 deaths since 1980 from 
other probes often homemade says the worm gettr instructions 
are inadequate and the device itself poses a good chance of a shock 
strong enough to kill 
the commission voted in 1987 to seek the recall of the worm 
gettr but it failed to win a federal court order in idaho last 
year to remove the device from the market an administratve law 
judge is considering the commission staffs petition to declare the 
probe a substantial product hazard that the commission could ban 
though a space of 50 years exists the storm trooper tactics of 
the ss and the safety nazi tactics of the staff of the cpsc hold 
many things in common dye said 
attempts were made to compromise with the cpsc shielding the 
products metal probe was suggested by us instruction changes and 
warnings were offered none of these was acceptable dye said 
he said commission investigators by subterfuge got access to his 
customer lists from his shipping company and visited customers 
seeking information this has caused some customers to cancel 
orders he said 
his appearance was arranged by republicans on the subcommittee 
rep howard c nielson rutah said this instance of what 
appears to be an abuse of authority without a sufficient factual 
basis is of interest because it was one of the prime reasons why the 
commission was not reauthorized last year 
the commission and its staff were vigorously defended by r david 
pittle a former commission member who is now technical director of 
consumers union publisher of consumer reports 
during the nine years i was a commissioner at least five 
manufacturers of worm probes voluntarily agreed to take the 
remedial action the commission deemed appropriate pittle said 
as an electrical engineer who has spent the last 20 years 
designing testing and evaluating consumer products i continue to 
believe that selling products that can predictably place live 
electrodes in the bare hands of consumers is wholly unreasonable 
and probably is against every known product standard in the 
civilized world 
in my view the commission and its staff acted correctly in 
trying to remove this hazard from the market pittle said 
commission spokesman dave shiflet said he could not comment in 
substance because the case was still before an administrative law 
judge except to say a settlement offer from mr dye was never 
sent to the administrative law judge as required by our procedures

a group of japanese scientists and 
technicians began talks wednesday with nicaraguan officials on the 
possible construction of a canal across nicaragua 
the sixmember private delegation met with a government committe 
headed by finance minister william hupper at the foreign ministry 
on wednesday morning reporters were not allowed access to the group 
barricada the official newspaper of the leftist sandinista 
government party said the japanese group inclues specialists in 
maritime law ecology engineering architecture and lumber 
it said the delegation arrived tuesday night in managua but did 
not say how long it would remain in the central american cuntry 
the japanese embassy in managua has said the japanese government 
is not involved in the delegation or the canal project 
the idea of building a canal across nicaragua to connect the 
atlantic and pacific oceans has been around since the late 1800s 
but panama was chosen instead for the construction of the canal 
the nicaraguan government when it announced in early february 
the formation of a committee to start feasibility studies said it 
welcomed private or public investment from other countries

as if planning the national battle against 
illegal drugs wasnt enough work president bush saddled william j 
bennett with another controversial job figuring out what to do 
about semiautomatic assault rifles 
how does he feel about becoming gun czar bennetts 
spokesman don hamilton said wednesday hes not too upset about 
it 
in fact bennett met wednesday with national rifle association 
representatives a meeting that had been scheduled before bush 
announced tuesday that he had asked his designated drug policy 
director to find a solution to the weapons problem hamilton said 
its not clear whether bennett will incorporate his 
recommendations into the national drug control strategy due 180 days 
after he is confirmed as director of national drug control policy or 
if he will issue a separate recommendation hamilton said 
asked wednesday what bennett and the nra representatives were 
discussing hamilton said i think hes seeking input and advice 
im rather confident he has not made up his mind 
hes interested in seeing that firepower out of the wrong 
hands hamilton said hes concerned with the problem and hed 
like to seek a solution thats consonant with the constitution and 
individuals rights concerning firearms but he doesnt want to see 
that firepower in the hands of drug traffickers and other bad guys 
the senate judiciary committee which held two days of hearings 
on bennetts nomination last week is scheduled to vote on it 
thursday there was little opposition raised during the hearings and 
he was expected to be approved by the committee then approved by 
the full senate possibly as soon as friday 
the weapons in question are semiautomatic adaptations of ak47s 
and uzis the tightly regulated military versions can switch back 
and forth from semiautomatic to automatic 
a host of drugrelated shootings and the killing of five 
california schoolchildren have prompted calls for a ban on the 
weapons with highcapacity ammunition clips bush a member of the 
nra has said he opposes such regulation while first lady barbara 
bush supports a ban

americans by a twotoone margin believe that 
japan not the united states is now the leading economic power in 
the world according to a public opinion poll released wednesday 
the poll conducted by the gallup organization for the times 
mirror co indicated that 59 percent of americans now rank japan 
first with only 29 percent choosing their own country 
our survey finds beneath the surface of general economic 
contentment much unease about the loss of us economic power to 
foreign competition said gallup president andrew kohut people 
see our ability to compete as declining in the reagan years 
on the other hand the survey found that 72 percent of policy 
makers executives and other opinion leaders still believe america 
is the no 1 economic power a sharp difference with the general 
public 
there was just as big a disagreement over the question of foreign 
investment in the united states an overwhelming majority of the 
public 70 percent saw foreign investment in very negative terms 
with many fearing that foreigners are buying america and 
threatening national security 
but opinion leaders saw foreign investment as a vital source of 
capital for economic expansion 
the survey one of a series the los angelesbased news company 
has commissioned on american attitudes was conducted between jan 
27 and feb 5 it included onehour facetoface interviews with 
2048 members of the general public and had a potential sampling 
margin of error of plus or minus two percentage points 
a separate survey sampled the opinion of 250 government policy 
makers corporate executives wall street financiers and foreign 
investors in the us economy 
the survey of the general public described as the most extensive 
ever on economic attitudes indicated that 54 percent of americans 
expect things will be better for them financially next year and an 
additional 28 percent expected no change in their economic outlook 
but they were much less optimistic about the nations overall 
economic prospects 
by sizable margins the general public said it expected inflation 
to worsen and interest rates to be rise fully 76 percent said they 
expected taxes to be increased in 1989 despite president bushs 
nonewtaxes campaign pledge 
the survey indicated that americans strongly oppose increasing 
general income taxes although large majorities were willing to see 
higher taxes on tobacco alcohol and on people with incomes over 
80000 a year 
the poll indicated 85 percent of americans favored raising taxes 
on alcoholic beverages to reduce the federal budget deficit 75 
percent favored boosting taxes on tobacco products and 64 percent 
were in favor of a national lottery to bring in revenues 
four out of five americans 82 percent favored increasing the 
income taxes of people with incomes above 80000 a smaller 
majority 59 percent endorsed a proposal to create a new 33 percent 
tax bracket for all income over 150000 
while calling the budget deficit a major problem only 18 percent 
of americans could come within 50 billion of guessing its size 
last years deficit totaled 1551 billion but 28 percent guessed 
it was over 300 billion 
fears of war and international tension were as low as they have 
been in 40 years the survey said for example 79 percent of the 
public feels that tensions with the soviets have been reduced 
as a reflection of the eased world tensions the survey found 
strong sentiment for cutting the military budget asked how to 
reduce the federal budget by 5 percent the public opted to take 
nearly half of the revenues from the defense budget 
the public strongly opposed cuts in social security or medicare 
to balance the budget

energy department negotiators should pressure 
the japanese into sharing the 46 billion cost of the super 
collider as a way for japan to pare its trade imbalance with the 
united states the chairman of a house subcommittee considering the 
project said wednesday 
japan is the no 1 costsharing suspect for us because of the 
bad balance of trade and we should approach them on that level 
rep ralph hall dtexas told doe officials during a hearing on 
foreign participation in the proposed giant atom smasher 
hall said later that the trade imbalance with japan would be a 
good lever in costsharing negotiations between officials of both 
countries 
it gives us a special incentive to dealing with japan said 
hall the chairman of the science space and technology committees 
subcommittee on international scientific cooperation 
the united states ran a trade deficit with japan of 554 billion 
in 1988 40 percent of the total us trade deficit of 137 billion 
james f decker deputy director of does energy research office 
told hall that us officials are in japan holding unofficial but 
very significant discussions with japans highenergy physics 
community on possible ways of collaboration 
decker said it is essential to encourage the enthusiastic 
support of the japanese scientists because strong endorsement at 
this level is almost certainly a prerequisite for japanese 
participation 
but the involvement of president bush and energy secretary james 
d watkins may be ultimately be needed to convince the japanese to 
invest in the project decker said 
only india has committed to helping build the super collider 
agreeing to put 50 million into the project a proposed 53mile 
underground tunnel south of dallas in which beams of protons would 
smash into each other with 20 times the energy of todays most 
powerful accelerators 
but neither foreign countries nor texas will be willing to 
bankroll the project unless congress commits to its construction 
the panel was told by decker and thomas w luce iii chairman of the 
texas national research laboratory commission the state agency 
handling texas role in the project 
if congress goes along with the president and agrees to spend 
250 million on the project in the fiscal 1990 budget including 
160 million for construction texas and foreign countries would 
read that as adequate commitment to the project the officials said 
the energy department is proposing 18 billion of the total cost 
come from nonfederal sources including 1 billion that texas has 
promised to spend

china is helping iran build a factory to 
make surfacetosurface missiles with a range exceeding 500 miles 
western diplomatic sources said wednesday 
they said construction has gone ahead since a unmediated 
ceasefire halted the eightyear iraniraq war on aug 20 and that 
iran also is continuing to develop its chemical warfare capability 
the sources speaking on the condition of not being identified 
said the missile factory is in northeastern iran but they could 
give no details 
one source remarked its a missile plant and the chinese are 
lending support to build it that much is known 
tehran television monitored in cyprus said chinas deputy prime 
minister tian jiyun ended a fiveday trip to iran on tuesday it 
made no mention of weapons saying only that the visit concentrated 
on trade and industrial ties 
china and iran both deny any arms deals but us and other 
western officials say china has been a main supplier of weapons for 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeinis regime they estimated such sales at 
more than 1 billion 
among the arms supplied were two types of jet aircraft and the 
hy2 silkworm and c801 antiship missiles which have a range of 
less than 100 miles 
the tehran government said a year ago it was building its own 
version of a foreign missile not further identified for use 
against iraq 
according to the authoritative reference janes weapons systems 
chinas arsenal does not include a surfacetosurface missile with a 
500 to 600mile range but western experts said then it would be 
relatively simple for iran to have copied sovietdesigned scudb 
rockets acquired from syria or libya 
the war between iran and iraq its persian gulf neighbor began 
in september 1980 and was marked by periodic missile bombardments of 
each others population centers in what became known as the war of 
the cities 
baghdad the iraqi capital lies only 60 miles from the border 
and so the initial advantage went to iran last spring however 
iraq began using longrange missiles to hit tehran and other areas 
of iran previously beyond range 
some analysts have said iraqs use of scudbs with boosters to 
increase their 160mile range was a major factor in forcing iran to 
agree to a truce

the strike against eastern airlines threatens to 
spread to several railroads if a federal judges restraining order 
expires or is overturned 
in that case rail employees could observe eastern employees 
picket lines here are answers to some questions raised by the case 
q why could rail passengers be affected by an airline strike 
a because easterns unions hope to bring pressure to bear on the 
airline and the government by extending the strike to other forms of 
transportation 
q but isnt such a tactic a secondary boycott illegal under 
the tafthartley act of 1947 
a yes but the railroad and airline unions are covered by the 
railway labor act of 1926 not tafthartley 
q why are those unions outside the main body of labor 
legislation 
a because in the 1920s the railroads had unparalleled power 
wealth and political influence and because their pay and mediation 
practices were different from everyone elses 
q but why are airlines covered by the railway act 
a when congress amended the railway act in 1934 the unions of 
the fledgling airline industry lobbied to be included congress went 
along although it may not have realized at the time how soon 
airlines would dwarf railroads in importance transportation unions 
in other industries such as trucks and buses are covered by the 
wagner act of 1935 which tafthartley amended 
q why wouldnt congress extend its policy against secondary 
boycotts to the railway act 
a the railway unions had much more political power immediately 
after world war ii than they do today so amending the act would 
have been problematic the railway act moreover represented a 
compromise worked out by management and labor specifically for their 
industry congress was reluctant to tamper with it 
q how have other secondary boycotts turned out 
a until 1947 they were one of organized labors most potent 
weapons the few secondary boycotts that have occurred since have 
been brief either the president stepped in and imposed a 
coolingoff period or judges stopped them citing the public 
welfare 
q what commuter rail lines might be struck if the judge does not 
bar a sympathy strike 
a twelve commuter lines in addition to amtrak could be shut 
down they are the long island rail road the metronorth commuter 
railroad new jersey transit port authority transhudson or path 
the massachusetts bay transportation authority the northern indiana 
commuter transportation district the maryland transportation 
authority of baltimore and suburban washington the southeastern 
pennsylvania transportation authority the rapid transit authority 
in chicago caltrans which operates between san francisco and san 
jose the port authority of allegheny county in pittsburgh and 
trirail southern floridas new 67mile rail system 
q metronorth and long island rail road are owned by the 
metropolitan transportation authority a creature of the state of 
new york so why arent the railroad employees governed by the 
states taylor law which prohibits strikes by public employees 
a the supreme court has ruled that those workers are covered by 
the railway act which preceded the taylor law 
q why has us district judge robert patterson issued an 
injuncton against the secondary boycott doesnt the norrisla 
guardia act bar such action by the federal judiciary in labor 
disputes 
a there is an exception for crossindustry secondary boycotts 
and strikes reflecting congresss conviction that labor battles 
including strikes should be restricted to unions and companies in 
the same industry 
q but since eastern and the railroads are all covered by the 
same labor legislation arent they in the same industry 
a thats for the courts to say

a scientist who developed a vaccine to 
protect monkeys against a virus distantly related to the one that 
causes aids cautioned wednesday the work probably wont lead to an 
aids vaccine anytime soon 
it would be foolish on my part to say yeah this opens up the 
way for a vaccine for aids said dr richard g olsen a professor 
emeritus of veterinary pathobiology at ohio state university 
whether it would work for aids id be very skeptical 
however one wellknown aids researcher said he thought the 
monkey vaccine could be quite valuable in developing an aids vaccine 
olsen and ohio state graduate students last week announced 
preliminary success with a vaccine to immunize monkeys against the 
htlv1 virus the vaccine uses an approach similar to that of a 
vaccine olsen developed several years ago which veterinarians now 
use to protect millions of house cats from a deadly disease 
that illness called feline leukemia the htlv1 virus which 
causes adult tcell leukemia and lymphoma and the virus that causes 
aids all belong to the retrovirus family unlike other viruses 
retroviruses become part of a chromosome which carries genetic 
information 
the aids virus has other characteristics in common with htlv1 
both can be transmitted through blood sexual intercourse and 
contaminated needles and htlv1 causes aidslike symptoms in 
monkeys 
some of the eight or so macaque monkeys vaccinated by olsens 
group and then exposed to htlv1 have gone as long as two years 
without their blood cells showing any signs of infection olsen said 
all five or six monkeys in a control group that were exposed to 
the virus without being vaccinated eventually developed the illness 
he said 
olsen said his research during the next two years will attempt to 
prove the vaccine can prevent the virus from getting into a 
chromosome and lying dormant 
youre in essence dealing with an agent thats adding new 
genetic material to the host chromosome olsen said 
the vaccine does not contain the virus just pieces and parts 
of proteins that make up the virus olsen said 
dr danny bolognesi a virologist and professor of experimental 
surgery at duke university said he was not familiar with olsens 
work but that a vaccine against htlv1 virus would be significant in 
terms of aids research 
any vaccine against any member of the retrovirus family is of 
enormous value bolognesi said 
asked about the adaptability of a vaccine from monkeys to humans 
bolognesi said thats pretty close its a good model i would 
say the transition to man would not be too difficult 
olsen said ohio state researchers are in their fourth year of 
research on the htlv1 vaccine ohio state plans to open a center 
for retrovirus research next month using university money and 
royalties from the cat vaccine but olsen said his group would not 
try to work with the more volatile aids virus for at least a couple 
of years 
were going to finish what weve got do well with what weve 
got before jumping into other things he said 
the aids virus changes very rapidly he said the htlv1 
virus is far more stable genetically 
he explained that drawing blood from 10 people and growing the 
htlv1 virus in tissue cultures would result in little or no 
difference in the virus from person to person doing the same thing 
with the aids virus would produce different results from person to 
person olsen said 
thats whats going to make the aids vaccine thing very 
difficult he said

maurice turner jr the district of columbias 
police chief said wednesday that medical researchers should find a 
way to immunize youngsters so they wont get high on drugs and thus 
would avoid becoming involved in the narcotics trade that has 
contributed to a crime wave here 
i believe the greatest contribution the medical community of 
this great nation could ever conceive for our children would be the 
development of an inoculation or vaccine that would block the 
euphoria or high our youth receive from smoking ingesting or 
injecting pcp crack cocaine cocaine or heroin into their bodies 
turner told reporters 
however dr marvin snyder director of preclinical research at 
the national institute on drug abuse said the idea of inoculation 
was theoretically possible but not practical

texas sen lloyd bentsen in his first tough 
call since running for vice president last year parted company with 
virtually all of his fellow senate democrats wednesday in declaring 
hell vote for fellow texan john tower as defense secretary 
but his endorsement seemed to avoid putting personal prestige on 
the line for his former senate colleague or another texas friend 
george bush 
i hope that when i get the next chance to talk with john tower 
about tough job of keeping this country strong it will be while 
hes in his new office bentsen said in a speech to the senate 
his announcement ended weeks of silence on his part and 
speculation by others on whether bentsen would side with bush or 
with his democratic colleagues 
it came only after majority leader george mitchell dmaine 
predicted the votes were in place to defeat the nomination whatever 
bentsens decision 
sen sam nunn dga the armed services committee chairman and 
the man leading the opposition to tower walked over to bentsen 
touched his shoulder and shook his hand 
bentsens decision was closely watched both because of his texas 
ties and because of the visibility he has held since he had the no 
2 spot on the democratic ticket last fall 
bentsen has assumed the role of party heavyweight delivering the 
senate democratic response to bushs first speech to congress and 
declaring his opposition to some of the administrations spending 
cuts and tax proposals 
when tower was nominated in january bentsens vote for him 
seemed a sure thing bentsen spoke warmly about his longtime 
colleague when he first presented tower to the senate armed service 
committee as bushs choice for secretary of defense 
he brushed aside as just politics the brutal attacks against 
democrats by tower during last falls campaign bentsen sought to 
reassure more liberal senators that the hawkish tower was a good 
choice to hold down spending 
john tower is too much of a conservative to give a blank check 
from the us treasury to the pentagon bentsen said 
but as the showdown over the nomination grew in intensity 
bentsen avoided the senate debate until wednesday and kept quiet 
on how his vote would be cast 
republicans in texas became impatient as did bush whose calls 
included one during his far east trip bentsen spoke to the 
president on three or four occasions said jack devore 
bentsens spokesman 
tower supporters from texas pressured bentsen with telephone 
banks and newspaper ads 
one of the texas ads referred to him as l millard bentsen 
a swipe at alleged snootiness derived from last years campaign 
when bentsen and michael dukakis referred to nowvice president dan 
quayle as j danforth quayle 
but friends and allies said bentsen reelected to a sixyear 
senate at the same time he lost his vice presidential bid felt 
little direct political pressure 
bentsen reached his decision over the weekend devore said 
fellow democrats would understand bentsen siding with tower 
because texans have a long tradition of closing ranks said 
joseph oneill a washington lobbyist who has been bentsens top 
senate aide and was chief of staff for his vice presidential 
campaign 
he also would have been safe politically if he had gone against 
tower said george christian a texas friend and consultant who 
served as press secretary to president lyndon johnson 
there is not a high degree of passion on either side in texas 
its almost titillation rather than any comsuming passion in it 
he said the campaigns to influence bentsen were wasting their 
money he said 
tower supporters expressed relief at bentsens announcement 
i think that the timing would have been better if it came 
earlier in the debate but at this stage ill take him any time i 
can get him said tower friend paul eggers 
brad oleary a washington consultant who raised money for 
towers senate campaigns said bentsens timing was on target 
for boosting the nomination 
waiting for one or two other people to do it and and then 
standing up and doing it helps build a little psychological 
momentum he said

the john birch society is pulling up roots and 
moving out of the liberal stronghold of massachusetts but a 
spokesman said wednesday the archconservatives were driven away by 
prices not politics 
the aspects of massachusetts that we couldnt take was the 
expense to live here said john mcmanus at the groups 
headquarters in belmont a boston suburb 
the group plans to close its belmont and san marino calif 
offices and consolidate operations in appleton wis by the fall 
reasons for the move include lower overhead and the fact that the 
new chief executive officer g allen bubolz lives in appleton 
mcmanus said 
appleton also is near grand chute hometown of republican sen 
joseph mccarthy which mcmanus termed a delightful piece of 
irony mccarthy led investigations into alleged communist 
influence in the 1950s 
the 31yearold society which once labeled president eisenhower 
a dedicated conscious agent of the communist conspiracy has 
struggled financially for years making a appeal for funds after 
founder robert hw welch jr died in 1985 
if anybody in the midwest wants to say thank you to anybody for 
the john birch society moving in that area they can thank gov 
michael dukakis they can thank sen ted kennedy and the 
massachusetts congressional delegation said mcmanus blaming the 
democratic politicians for the high cost of living in the area 
the society listed 1987 liabilities of 85 million in its latest 
filing with the state the fund balance showed a loss of 78 
million compared with a starting deficit of 77 million 
we have always been in debt we always spent more money than we 
took in and we always had to go in and scramble mcmanus said 
belmont town officials didnt return telephone calls wednesday 
news of the move prompted mixed reaction in appleton mayor 
dorothy johnson said the town was open to people of all views but 
city attorney greg carmen said he was worried that appletons image 
would be hurt 
we dont expect everyone to welcome us with open arms 
mcmanus said but we mean him no harm nor do we mean harm to any 
american 
welch a candy maker was one of 12 men who founded the society 
in 1958 convinced that leaders around the globe were secretly 
planning a world government 
the society was named after an american intelligence officer who 
was killed by chinese communists in 1945 birchers consider him the 
first casualty of the cold war mcmanus said the socity has several 
tens of thousands of members

former astronaut sally k ride told a senate 
committee wednesday the united states and other nations in the world 
need to undertake a comprehensive study of the earth in learn how to 
protect the planet from the destructive influences of humanity 
ride the first american woman in space said science now 
recognizes that activities of civilization have begun to affect 
the conditions of the planet but there is little fundamental 
understanding of how the earths weather geology oceans and ice 
react together to influence the environment 
we do not yet understand how our planet works she said 
the earth is a very complicated place it has to be studied as a 
system 
ride said a project called mission to planet earth would for the 
first time study the earth in a way that would relate to each other 
all of the natural and human forces that influence the planet 
she was one of three witness testifying in support of the project 
before the senate committee on commerce science and transportation 
sen al gore dtenn a member of the committee said there is a 
need for the mission because humans are beginning to realize that 
industrial chemicals and gases released into the atmosphere have the 
potential of affecting life on the planet by changing the weather 
and climate 
he said most nations already recognize the need to halt release 
of chemicals that erode the ozone layer of the upper atmosphere and 
that carbon dioxide and other gases from industry may be affecting 
the earths climate through the socalled greenhouse effect 
the greenhouse effect is a planetary warming caused by certain 
gases in the atmosphere that trap heat from the sun most of these 
gases such as carbon dioxide are produced mainly by the burning of 
fossil fuels 
sen ernest f hollings chairman of the committee said that the 
costs for the mission have been estimated at 20 to 30 billion out 
to the year 2010 ride said the cost would be about a billion 
dollars a year and that foreign nations could pay a share 
the former astronaut who joined the faculty at stanford 
university after leaving nasa said mission to planet earth would 
involve nine instrumented satellites experiments aboard the 
proposed space station science stations on earth and a data 
handling system that would analyze all of the collected information 
ride said that the project would require the cooperation and 
participation of all the earths nations some nations she said 
could provide at least two of the satellites and most countries 
could establish and operate ground monitoring stations to gather 
measurements from all over the globe 
another witness don l anderson of the california institute of 
technology said a coordinated effort between earth space ocean 
and atmospheric studies would be needed to understand how each 
element affects the weather climate and rainfall on the planet 
he said with a thorough study of earth from a variety of 
perspectives would enable scientists within 20 years to make 
accurate predictions about weather the changes in geology and 
climate and how human actions affect the planet 
lennard a fisk chief of space sciences at the national 
aeronautics and space administration said the agency already has 
made organizational steps toward starting a major effort to study 
earth he said specific plans will be presented to congress in june 
including plans for satellites

the dangers described in an environmental 
protection agency draft report on the effects of oil drilling on 
alaskas north slope are misleading and no reason to delay oil 
exploration in more arctic areas a senate committee was told 
wednesday 
sen frank murkowski ralaska said the draft report first 
described in a story in sundays new york times needs substantial 
work before its finished 
its not an objective portrayal he said 
tom williams a member of the senate energy and natural resources 
committee staff said the draft was a summary of a trip report 
after a visit to the coastal plain of the arctic national wildlife 
refuge anwr where oil exploration has been proposed 
the problems which are documented in the report are activities 
which have been raised for not opening anwr from the beginning 
said williams 
the draft epa report said improper and careless management of 
chemical oil wastes on alaskas north slope is seriously damaging 
the delicate tundra the times reported 
the report said acres of tundra have been damaged by chemical 
spills oil wastes seeping from drilling pads stacks of leaking 
chemical drums a mine flooded by a diverted river overflowing 
waste disposal pits and failure to comply with federal regulations 
governing the handling of hazardous materials by oil companies in 
the prudhoe bay oilfields 
anwr just east of the prudhoe bay fields is considered a 
promising area for a strike that could produce up to 32 billion 
barrels of oil but it also is the breeding ground for north 
americas largest remaining herd of migratory caribou and the 
habitat for polar bears musk oxen wolves arctic foxes waterfowl 
and fish 
legislation that would allow exploratory drilling to begin is 
being debated by the senate energy and natural resources committee 
but no action has been taken 
murkowski in promoting the bill said that since the drilling in 
prudhoe bay began there have been advancements in technology that 
minimize damage to the environment 
furthermore he said if no oil is found the area will revert 
completely to its natural state

oliver north once shrugged off the idea that 
his work on behalf of the nicaraguan contras might get him in 
trouble saying i dont care if i have to go to jail for this i 
dont care if i have to lie to congress a witness testified at 
his trial wednesday 
charges against north include lying to congress about his 
involvement in aid to the contras at a time when us military help 
was banned 
conservative fundraiser carl r channel said north made the 
statement in a conversation with nelson bunker hunt after flying to 
dallas to brief the wealthy texan on the situation in nicaragua 
the only thing that sticks in my mind is that bunker said what 
are you going to do do you mind getting into trouble channell 
testified after north gave his answer channell said hunt 
chortled 
meanwhile in a related irancontra case the trial of retired 
vice adm john poindexter formerly a national security adviser and 
norths boss was shifted from the court of us district judge 
gerhard gesell to that of judge aubrey robinson gesell is presiding 
over the north trial now in its fifth week 
the testimony about hunt was part of a daylong recitation by 
channell about putting north then a national security council aide 
together with wealthy people for briefings about fighting in 
nicaragua 
channell said north never personally solicited contributions the 
former marine lieutenant colonel is charged with conspiring to 
defraud the us treasury as part of the moneyraising efforts 
hed say if people wanted to give after he gave the briefing 
they should give to someone else said channell under 
crossexamination by north lawyer brendan sullivan if someone 
said who do i make the check out to he said you make out the 
check to spitzs organization 
spitz is channells nickname his organization was called the 
national endowment for the preservation of liberty 
the organization was recognized by the internal revenue service 
as a taxexempt foundation meaning contributions were 
taxdeductible one of the 12 charges on which north is being tried 
says that instead of the money going for charitable works it went 
for contra arms instead 
i was aware we had varied from our mandate but felt that could 
be resolved said channell who said hed assumed since they had 
been working with the white house the legal consel there would find 
a way to justify where the money had gone 
channell pleaded guilty on april 29 1987 to depriving the 
government of tax revenue by using the foundation to solicit 
contributions for military equipment for the contras he has not 
been sentenced he pledged under a pleabargaining agreement to 
testify for the government whenever he was called on 
under questioning by norths attorney he said he was proud of 
his work for the contras 
he testified he received a letter from thenpresident reagan 
commending his efforts and then a telephone call the president 
mentioned that he did not understand the opposition of thenhouse 
speaker thomas p oneill jr to contra aid 
channell said he told reagan that oneill prays every day to 
defeat everything you believe in and you must fight him as an enemy 
and defeat him 
he said that the northhunt meeting was in dallas petroleum club 
on sept 11 1985 and that north flew there from washington in a 
channellarranged airplane at the end of the meeting north left 
saying something like you all are going to talk about money and i 
cant take any money 
during the congressional irancontra hearings two years ago 
north testified i do not recall ever asking a single solitary 
american citizen for money although i showed a lot of munitions 
lists 
hunt contributed 237500 to the foundation and also made a 
237500 loan to it 
in addition channell testified that north told a connecticut 
woman ellen garwood about a need for small airplanes for the 
rebels later that day she wrote out a check for 75000 and wrote 
across the top that it was tax deductible he said 
mrs garwood was at the airport after the northhunt meeting he 
said ollie talked about the need for more planes and she gave 
nepl a check for 32000 to buy a small plane 
when hunts checks arrived channell said he asked north to 
telephone his thanks north called hunt at his home and it happened 
that the late cia director william casey was a dinner guest 
channell said north commented that the director would now know 
what was going on 
he also testified he arranged for a 1015 minute meeting between 
a wealthy woman barbara newington and reagan later that day he 
said north talked with her and channell told north he was going to 
ask her for a large grant 
grant asked gesell you asked her for money 
i told colonel north i would try to ask her for over a million 
dollars channel replied 
the woman made her contribution later more than 1 million in 
stocks channell said

the united states is holding up 230 million in 
aid for egypt because president hosni mubaraks government has 
failed to adopt acceptable economic reforms state department 
spokesman charles redman said wednesday 
redman denied that the aid was contingent on egypts agreeing 
with the international monetary fund on an economic austerity 
package but said it was important that the reforms adopted command 
broad international support including that of the imf and world 
bank 
redman denied a report in the washington post that quoted an 
unidentified us official as saying were holding out at this 
point for an agreement with the imf 
its not because of the imf agreement said redman 
egyptian sources said however that the united states was tying 
its decision to imf conditions which they said may be applicable in 
general but would be very difficult to implement in egypt because of 
the low incomes of many 
the sources who spoke to a reporter on condition they not be 
identified noted recent rioting over imf reforms in venezuela 
algeria tunisia and morocco and recalled that egypt had foodprice 
riots 12 years ago that forced president anwar sadat to roll back 
increases 
at least 79 people were killed in the 1977 riots with some 
estimates of the casualties going to 800 killed and injured 
we agree with the imf on the diagnosis and the prescription 
but we differ on the amount of time to implement it said one 
source egypt which already has increased prices on bread and other 
basic commodities five to ten times in recent years would like to 
phase in the reforms over a few years he said 
ideally we would like very much to implement the reforms at the 
same pace recommended by the imf but its a question of 
practicality he said adding that the egyptian government hoped 
washington as an ally and friend would be more sensitive to our 
political and social circumstances than a bank 
we regard the relationship with egypt as extremely important 
both to us as well as to the interest of broader stability in the 
region redman said 
he said the aid a portion of about 45 billion in economic and 
military assistance approved for the 1988 and 1989 fiscal years was 
being held up because the legislation approved by congress made it 
contingent on the understanding that egypt will undertake 
significant economic reforms which are additional to those which 
were undertaken in previous fiscal years

the state commerce department estimated wednesday 
that 8 million in tourist dollars would be lost this week in 
florida because of the strike against eastern airlines 
the state said it based its figures on an estimate that 10 
percent of air tourists who had planned to visit florida could not 
get there 
meanwhile competing airlines increased flights and cruise lines 
booked extra hotel rooms and delayed ship departures as the tourism 
industry made do 
the shock for travelers was lessened somewhat by the diversity of 
airlines passing through south florida a brief lull in vacations 
before easter weekend and the weeks of warning about the strike for 
travel agents and competing airlines 
we really havent felt it because there are so many airlines 
going in and out of miami said travel agent barry white it 
could be a shaking out that could make things more efficient 
officials at miami international airport are seeing daily 
adjustments as competitors take advantage of easterns misfortune 
overall the travel industry seemed to have adjusted to easternless 
skies over florida and the caribbean 
continental has increased operations from 17 to 34 flights 
daily i know united has expanded american has expanded 
positions here said dick judy director of dade countys aviation 
department which operates miami international airport 
caribbean travel is largely unaffected because most islands are 
served by more than one carrier or can be reached through puerto 
rico connections judy said 
eastern carried about 2 million passengers a year to 15 
destinations in the caribbean 
a total of 413 passengers had eastern tickets saturday coming off 
the 1800passenger norway in miami they were taken to a hotel 
while new arrangements were made 
some of them went to the pool and were enjoying the amenities 
of the hotel they were in pretty good spirits said fran sevcik 
spokeswoman for kloster cruise ltd which operates norwegian cruise 
line and royal viking line of course getting off a sevenday 
cruise helps 
but she said the strike altered the relationship between her 
company and eastern which had been one of the top three airlines 
carrying norwegian cruise ship passengers in and out of miami 
until all of their labor contracts are agreed upon we would 
not even consider using them now ms sevcik said wednesday 
wed cross that bridge when we came to it 
robert joedicke an airline specialist with shearson lehman 
hutton inc said easterns competitors are making contingency plans 
but wont make longterm adjustments until easterns future is 
decided 
royal caribbean cruise line which relied on eastern for up to 60 
percent of its passengers changed travel plans for 3000 people 
spent more than 50000 on hotel rooms had full crews working 
overnight on rebookings and were unable to accommodate only three 
people last weekend said spokesman richard steck 
norwegians norway left port 7 hours late saturday but no one 
canceled ms sevcik said 
it gets easier and easier steck said were buying space 
into the future to replace the eastern space but we have the luxury 
of time on our side 
carnival cruise lines the industry leader is putting all our 
passengers obviously on noneastern flights said spokesman tim 
gallagher we got them all here last weekend and were confident 
well get them all here this weekend 
service to latin america is more difficult to adjust because of 
treaty agreements but pan am is competitive in several markets that 
eastern served judy said 
latin america has been one of the areas where eastern has grown 
tremendously in the last two years said company spokeswoman 
virginia sanchez estimating the airline carried 700000 passengers 
last year

the soviet union announced on wednesday 
that it will accept the authority of the world court in major human 
rights treaties ending 40 years of resistance to the courts 
jurisdiction 
state department officials hailed the move as a step toward an 
eventual agreement under which moscow would join washington in 
accepting the courts rulings in all but the most sensitive 
political and national security cases 
the un legal office released a letter from soviet foreign 
minister eduard a shevardnadze to secretarygeneral javier perez de 
cuellar withdrawing soviet reservations to human rights treaties 
the soviet union had signed the treaties but added the 
reservation that it did not accept world court authority in disputes 
the world court formally known as the international court of 
justice at the hague is the main judicial body of the united 
nations it has no powers of enforcement but its rulings carry a 
major moral impact on world opinion 
shevardnadze said the soviet union would recognize the binding 
jurisdiction of the court in these human rights treaties 
the 1948 convention on the prevention and punishment of the 
crime of genocide 
the 1949 convention for the suppression of the traffic in 
persons and of the exploitation of the prostitutions of others 
the 1952 convention on the political rights of women 
the 1965 international convention on the elimination of all 
forms of racial discrimination 
the 1979 convention on the elimination all forms of 
discrimination against women 
the 1984 convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or 
degrading treatment or punishment 
shevardnadzes letter suggested the soviet union will agree to 
the courts authority in all human rights cases 
he noted that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev in 1988 
suggested before the general assembly that all states recognize 
the binding jurisdiction of the international court of justice with 
respect to the interpretation and application of human rights 
agreements 
a senior state department official speaking on condition of 
anonymity noted that soviet legal writers previously said the court 
is dominated by western influences 
shevardnadzes letter may indicate their seriousness in 
accepting the courts jurisdiction in a greater range of cases 
the official said it is a major step 
the united states has been suggesting that the soviets britain 
france and china join it in agreeing to accept the courts 
jurisdiction except in cases involving national security or the use 
of force 
that would avoid cases like nicaraguas 1986 dispute with 
washington in which the sandinista government contended the united 
states was illegally mining its harbors and supporting the contra 
rebels the us government refused to honor a world court ruling 
that sided with the sandinistas

radioactive gas leaked into the air from a steam generator tube 
the company said wednesday the leak never posed a threat to 
employees or the public 
things are well under control said mike mullen a spokesman 
for duke power co which owns the plant were still under a 
state of alert purely as a conservative measure until the 
temperature of the water inside the unit can be cooled down 
an alert the secondleast serious emergency classification was 
declared at 1145 pm tuesday at the plant by duke officials who 
began shutting down unit 1 a minute later duke alerted state and 
local authorities at 1201 am 
the nuclear regulatory commission said all safety systems 
functioned normally during the event 
mullen said the leak occurred at 1137 pm tuesday apparently 
in one or more of the 4600 tubes inside each of the four steam 
generators that are used to make electricity in the plants two 
nuclear units 
the leak contaminated an undetermined amount of water and allowed 
a small amount of radioactive gas to escape from an auxiliary 
building adjacent to the turbine building he said 
the gas leak lasted less than 10 minutes mullen said 
mullen said minute releases of radioactive materials occasionally 
occur at nuclear power plants and are strictly monitored by federal 
officials the amount released tuesday night was well within those 
guidelines he said 
mullen said the leak was under investigation 
the unit could be shut down for weeks as the expensive repairs 
are made said mullen this will require cleaning up the secondary 
side where the contamination occurred he said we also will 
have to repair the tubes 
the biggest job wednesday afternoon was cleaning up the 
contaminated water the spokesman said 
the nrc said it was sending a team to investigate the incident

the senate labor and human resources committee 
approved legislation wednesday to gradually raise the minimum wage 
130 an hour to 465 after rejecting a bush administration plan 
for a smaller increase coupled with a reduced training wage 
president bush has said he would veto legislation raising the 
minimum above 425 an hour and told gop leaders wednesday that in 
the words of press secretary marlin fitzwater his proposal is 
fair and firm and his last offer 
sen edward m kennedy the labor committee chairman said he was 
hopeful we can reach a compromise that is fairer to the working 
poor and that president bush will sign 
kennedy a massachusetts democrat said the full senate could 
consider the measure next week were all set to go to the floor 
right away he said i think well have strong support 
the minimum wage now 335 an hour has not been raised in eight 
years 
kennedy said he is glad to listen to republican calls for a 
subminimum wage but only if it is coupled with specific 
requirements for training and education 
kennedy predicted a veto would be overridden 
were going to get this legislation achieved he said if 
its the judgment that bush will veto it well override it 
kennedy told reporters after the meeting 
the committee approved the 130 increase on an 115 vote with 
republican sens david durenberger of minnesota and james jeffords 
of vermont voting with the panels nine democrats the approval came 
after democrats joined by durenberger rejected the white house 
proposal to raise the hourly minimum 30 cents each year for three 
years to 425 
the house subcommittee on labor standards has scheduled a 
thursday meeting to draft legislation similar to kennedys bill 
rep augustus hawkins dcalif chairman of the house education and 
labor committee plans to have the full panel consider the 465 an 
hour minimum wage which he has said he strongly supports 
bushs proposal long opposed by democrats and organized labor 
would establish a training wage of 335 an hour the current 
minimum for all workers and allow employers to pay newly hired 
workers at that rate for their first six months on the job 
while opposition to the submiminum wage has softened kennedy 
said wednesday that such a category would have to be sharply limited 
from what the administration wants 
im not going to see the corruption of the minimum wage by 
using the words training wage to throw older workers out of work 
and displace those who want to work 40 hours a week kennedy said 
im open to listening to having the educational components 
outlined he added there was nothing in the administration 
proposal that had an educational component 
he said such a plan would also have to be limited to firsttime 
workers and be for a shorter duration than six months 
kennedy while noting the administrations threatened veto 
agreed that bushs call for an increase in the minimum wage had 
boosted chances that some increase will soon be approved 
this administration has been more forthcoming than the previous 
eight years the senator said 
the committee approved three amendments to the bill kennedy 
introduced 
the first mirrors a provision in the white house plan to raise 
the level at which small businesses are exempted from minimum wage 
provisions from gross annual sales of 362000 to 500000 
another proposal also supported by bush would raise from 40 
percent to 50 percent the socalled tip credit employers are 
allowed to count a certain percentage of tips toward the reported 
salaries of workers covered by the minimum wage 
the committee also accepted a proposal to extend federal minimum 
wage standards to puerto rico

communist party leaders have ordered an 
evaluation of stalinist crimes in poland and an analysis of the 
cult that surrounded polands 1950s leader boleslaw bierut the 
state news agency said wednesday 
the leaders also called for ways to eliminate remnants of 
stalinism and urged political and moral compensation for actions 
of lawlessness and wrongs sustained by citizens in the stalinist 
era pap reported without elaborating 
pap said the comments were made at a tuesday meeting of the 
politburo which deemed it necessary to make a comprehensive and 
indepth analysis of postulates concerning the activity of boleslaw 
bierut and the symbols of his cult 
bierut a slight mustachioed man who was installed as the polish 
leader on soviet dictator josef stalins orders directed the polish 
united workers communist party from 1948 until his death in moscow 
in 1956 after attending the 20th congress of the communist party of 
the soviet union 
bierut became ill at the congress where stalin his mentor who 
died in 1953 was denounced by thensoviet leader nikita khrushchev 
after bierut died he was replaced by a populist communist 
leader wladyslaw gomulka who introduced a political thaw and 
released thousands of people jailed for alleged political crimes 
while bierut was in power 
the victims included many members of the underground resistance 
army that fought the nazi occupiers during world war ii 
in recent weeks in line with the attacks on stalinism in the 
soviet union there have been increasingly critical articles about 
bierut in the official press and proposals to rename bierut 
university in wroclaw and the bierut steel mill in czestochowa

a magnetic wave spewed from the sun on monday 
during a massive solar flare was detected wednesday on earth but 
federal experts said it arrived as a minor storm that should 
have only small effects on communications 
forecaster norman cohen at the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administrations space environment services center in boulder 
colo said instruments detected a proton event rapidly followed by 
a geomagnetic storm starting at about 1230 pm est 
he said both events originated from the solar flare that occurred 
on the eastern edge of the sun on monday cohen said the radiation 
and geomagnetism from the flare were small from the earths 
perspective because of the angle of emission from the sun 
had the flare been in the western half of the sun it could 
have caused serious problems he said 
the sunspot region that spawned the flare however is moving 
farther west as the sun rotates and should be in a position by 
monday to pose a greater radiation hazard to earth if another 
eruption occurs said cohen 
if it blew up on us then it could be quite exciting he said 
noaa experts said the sunspot region that produced the large 
flare continues to be active and that there is a 50 percent chance 
that another flare will occur before the region rotates out of view 
over the western limb or horizon of the sun 
cohen said the proton event which had been forecast for tuesday 
arrived at earth later than expected because of the eastern location 
of the flare on the sun protons originating from flares are high 
energy particles that can damage electronics on satellites cohen 
said the event detected wednesday was too small to cause such 
problems 
warnings were sent however to power and telephone companies 
about the geomagnetic storm he said he said the storm though 
classified as minor could cause a slight electrical surge on long 
utility lines at high latitudes 
geomagnetic bursts also can trigger brilliant displays of the 
aurora or polar lights and cohen forecast there should be 
increased activities at both poles 
mondays flare was classified as an x15 the largest since april 
1984 xrays from the flare were so powerful that they overloaded 
instruments on noaa satellites that measure solar activity up to a 
level of x12 a small flare classed as an x1 occurred tuesday 
solar flares are eruptions that burst suddenly from the face of 
the sun sending waves of electromagnetic radiation and charged 
particles out into space 
a burst of xrays which crosses the nearly 93 million miles 
between earth and the sun in just eight minutes was detected about 
905 am est monday it disrupted a coast guard loran navigation 
system and some short wave radio communications officials said 
goddard space center officials said the solar max satellite 
monitored by the national aeronautics and space administration also 
detected the flare on monday no problems were reported on any of 
the 21 satellites monitored by goddard 
the sun goes through phases of intense activity it passed a low 
point in 1986 and is now climbing toward an expected peak in 
intensity later this year or early in 1990

legislation wednesday that would set a 1000 fine and a oneyear 
term in jail for anyone displaying the american flag on the floor or 
ground 
the proposal by montgomery chairman of the house veterans 
affairs committee would expand a 1968 law providing penalties for

with great respect he said it certainly does not belong on the 
floor 
an exhibit at the school of art institute in chicago consists of 
the flag a wall display of pictures of flagdraped caskets south 
koreans burning the flag and a yankees go home sign and a

four plant workers and two subcontractor 
employees at a uranium processing plant showed high levels of 
uranium contamination in urine samples last year the us 
department of energy said 
however us rep thomas luken questioned the validity of the 
urine tests and asked the us environmental protection agency to 
return its inspectors to the plant at fernald 
the epa yanked the inspectors from the plant last december after 
independent urine tests showed that they too had been contaminated 
by uranium 
the plant 18 miles northwest of cincinnati processes uranium for 
the energy department which uses it elsewhere to make nuclear 
weapons 
pulling the inspectors luken said needlessly alarmed some plant 
workers and prompted the ohio environmental protection agency and 
some companies which serve the facility to pull out their 
representatives 
luken received a letter tuesday from james a reafsnyder the 
energy department manager at the plant it said the four plant 
workers and two subcontractor employees were the only ones who 
showed high levels of uranium contamination among 7300 people who 
were tested at the plant 
the letter said the six showed readings above 35 micrograms of 
uranium oxide dust per liter a level considered a health hazard 
subsequent urine samples did not show unhealthful levels reafsnyder 
said 
he also told luken that 20 plant workers had test results showing 
uranium levels which were lower but still above safety levels those 
workers were reassigned to other areas 
in his subsequent letter to the epa luken said the agencys 
partial quarantine was an arbitrary decision and told epa 
administrator william reilly the ban should be lifted at once 
epa has been cavalier in advising its own employees to stay 
away and leaving everyone else in a quandary said luken 
epa spokeswoman anne rowan in chicago said the agency is still 
reviewing results of tests on the two inspectors and plans to 
announce early next week whether it will allow its inspectors to 
return to the plant 
the agency also has asked a new laboratory to conduct future 
tests 
meanwhile the cincinnati enquirer reported that internal memos 
show that underground ponds of radioactive water have formed beneath 
three more buildings at the fernald plant posing a threat to water 
supplies as well as to the buildings 
westinghouse materials of ohio which operates the plant for the 
energy department said it has begun efforts to remedy the problems 
graham mitchell fernald team manager for the ohio epa said the 
information was no surprise the underground pools could seep 
through the ground and contaminate drinkingwater supplies for a 
wide area mitchell said 
reafsnyder said that clay under the plant seems to have confined 
the contamination

plo chairmans new peaceful image declaring that concessions never 
win back rights 
yitzhak rabin israels defense minister said attempts by 
radical plo factions to infiltrate israel from lebanon were 
clearcut terror despite remarks to the contrary attributed to 
secretary of state james a baker iii 
a senior palestine liberation organization official said in 
amman jordan the israeli army should expect retaliation for 
attacks on palestinians he added however that the plo will 
continue the moderate position it has taken since arafat renounced 
terrorism in december and recognized israel

peace with israel begins a threenation european tour thursday

declared in november by the palestine national council which acts 
as the plo legislature 
aafat said to prime minister benazir bhutto the first woman to 
lead a moslem country we know for freedom there is a very high 
price as you have paid for your freedom we will continue to pay 
for ours 
more than 100 foreign diplomats and dignitaries attended the 
ceremony 
assad in damascus did not mention arafat by name but declared 
in a clear reference that the policy of free concessions never led 
anyone to win back his rights 
whatever such concessions produce they will never achieve 
anything because in the end syria will say no the president said 
the policy of concessions is very far from our political and 
doctrinal thinking 
he was addressing a rally for the 26th anniversary of the baath 
socialist partys rise to power assad an air force captain in 
1963 became president in 1971 
assad has opposed previous efforts by arafat to negotiate with 
israel and has feuded with the plo chairman since 1983

deliberate intentions of perpetual aggression 
rabin told reporters at an army base in northern israel the 
guerrillas who tried to enter israel did so with the purpose to 
inflict damage killing maybe taking hostages 
what we have experienced in the last few months is clearcut 
terror he said if this is not terror i dont know what is 
terror 
a senior state department official quoted baker on tuesday as 
concluding the attempted raids were not acts of terrorism requiring 
a break in american contacts with the plo 
we make a mistake if we define that too closely he said of 
bakers view about the plo and terrorism 
washington began a dialogue with the plo after arafats 
declaration in december 
mahmoud abbas a member of the plo executive committee said 
raids from lebanon are aimed at military targets and do not violate 
the renunciation of terror 
we did not mean that armed struggle is a form of terroris he 
said in the jordanian capital the israeli army which is killing 
our children and raiding our camps should expect retaliation 
he added however we will not go back on our political 
position

in a bittersweet tribute to the start of the 
northeast shuttle eastern airlines on wednesday made a desperate 
attempt to lure passengers back to the service they pioneered in 
1961 by offering 12 oneway weekend fares and 49 oneway weekday 
fares 
this is a move to generate revenue right now for eastern 
airlines said george brennan vice president for marketing we 
have to breathe the life of passenger revenues into that operation 
the fares recall the 12 ticket offered in happier times 18 years 
ago when eastern introduced the original concept in commuter air 
travel between major cities in the northeast the current fare is 
99 oneway on weekdays and from 69 to 99 oneway on weekends 
the company will run fullpage newspaper ads as well as radio 
spots in boston new york and washington this week in hopes of 
bringing customers home 
competitor pan am corp said it would not slash fares to match 
and spokeswoman pamela hanlon reacted to easterns play on its old 
fare weve definitely got a 1989 product 
she noted that most shuttle passengers are business travelers who 
arent sensitive to fare changes it is a businessmans market 
its a mustgo market 
brennan denied the action was aimed at protecting the pending 
365 million sale of the shuttle service to new york developer 
donald trump 
he said eastern wants to at least keep its 62 daily shuttle 
flights which normally carry 6500 to 8000 passengers operating 
during the machinists strike which began saturday and nearly shut 
down the airline because pilots have honored picket lines 
the publics confusion has resulted in some eastern shuttle 
flights this week with as few as six passengers 
i can guarantee you were not making money at 12 but i can 
tell you at no dollars were making less he said 
the newspaper ads invite people to fly the original shuttle at 
the original price 12 one way were back 
eastern spokesman robin matell said shuttle passengers are not at 
risk of being stranded by a bankrupt airline because bankruptcy is 
still a last resort 
another spokesman james ashlock said eastern has pulled 
television ads and canceled other promotions since the strike 
advance bookings are near zero said joseph leonard executive 
vice president 
besides its shuttle easterns only other service is a 
thriceweekly roundtrip between miami and the south american cities 
of buenos aires and santiago that route requires little promotion 
even in normal times because of limited competition

an israeli think tank on wednesday urged 
the government to negotiate with the plo and said that with adequate 
security arrangements a palestinian state would not pose a deadly 
threat to israel 
the report set off a ruckus in the government the rightwing 
likud bloc and the centerleft labor party have governed israel in 
an uneasy coalition since elections in july 1984 and again in 
november 1988 ended in stalemates 
prime minister yitzhak shamir leader of the likud said the 
study undermines israels efforts to resist us and european 
pressures to talk with the plo shamir spokesman yossi achimeir said 
but finance minister and labor party leader shimon peres called 
the study intelligent and said israel must speak to palestinian 
representatives israel television said 
joseph alpher director of the 20member team that produced the 
study and a separate paper of recommendations said israel can 
set conditions on its agreement but it is going to have to talk to 
the plo to solve the problem under the present circumstances 
the study by tel aviv universitys jaffee center for strategic 
studies was sponsored by the american jewish congress and the 
antidefamation league of bnai brith 
in the peace proposal entitled toward a solution the 
independent think tank proposed a lengthy period of autonomy for the 
17 million palestinian residents of the occupied west bank and gaza 
strip as a precursor to possible statehood 
we are talking about a 10 to 15year process that begins with 
a series of confidencebuilding measures and new concepts on the 
part of both parties alpher said 
the 24page proposal conflicts with government policy ruling out 
talks with the plo and rejecting any possibility of a palestinian 
state the proposed transition period is considerably longer than 
the fiveyear interim period suggested by the 1978 camp david 
accords 
palestine liberation organization leader yasser arafat advocates 
an immediate turnover and predicted in a recent interview that a 
palestinian state would emerge in two years 
the center recommended israel should not commit itself to a 
palestinian state in advance but it urged israel not rule out the 
possibility noting that with proper security arrangements the 
concept of a palestinian state was not a mortal danger to the 
jewish state 
to win palestinian confidence israel would have to offer 
comprehensive selfrule in the west bank and gaza strip give up 
control over most state land in occupied zones and stop building 
jewish settlements 
palestinians would have to cease violent acts and terrorism 
against israeli targets and accept that palestinian refugees would 
not be able to return to israel 
in an interview alpher said the plo also would have to agree to 
israel keeping some arab land seized in the 1967 middle east war and 
to limitations on the sovereignty of a new state including israels 
control of its airspace 
the 235page study said 22 million of the worlds 46 
palestinians live in arab states half of them in teeming refugee 
camps 
it says the sudden and unplanned movement of refugees to a new 
state posed a serious danger of economic collapse social chaos and 
renewed guerrilla insurgency against israel 
the center proposed that during an interim period arab states 
begin resettling the camp residents on their own territory and that 
only a portion of the refugees move to a new palestine state 
the study says the sudden separation of israel and the west bank 
would cause economic hardship for both sides with israel losing 
workers and an export market while 100000 palestinians would lose 
their jobs in israel 
an initial investment of up to 25 billion would be needed for 
building basic industry electricity roads and a port in gaza 
about 2 billion would be needed annually for several years to 
prevent a drop in living standards it said 
the study says israel which receives about 3 billion annually 
in us aid would need additional funds up to 10 billion would be 
needed to resettle 20000 israeli settlers withdraw israeli troops 
relocate military facilities and erect an electronic border fence 
the reports authors included an exdirector of military 
intelligence a former head of the military government in the west 
bank and a wellknown conservative scholar

the un human rights commission on wednesday 
approved a draft convention on the rights of children that leaves 
open the legal status of the unborn 
a red cross spokesman said the wording of the convention which 
is subject to approval by the un general assembly would weaken 
international laws against employing children in warrelated 
activities 
approval by the 43nation panel came without a vote after many 
speakers welcomed the draft but also listed reservations polands 
adam lopatka who headed the negotiations on the project since they 
began in 1978 told the commission it was the product of 
compromises 
he cited specifically the drafts definition of a child article 
1 defines as a child everyone below age 18 unless legal adulthood is 
attained earlier under national law another article has signatories 
recognizing that every child has the inherent right to life 
the preamble of the draft refers to a 1959 un general assembly 
declaration on the rights of the child before as well as after 
birth ireland and west germany led the fight for including the 
preamble 
but lopatka said no consensus was possible on whether to include 
a reference to the unborn child in the conventions articles he 
said negotiators faced principal divergence of views on this 
issue and decided to leave it open to national legislation 
in daylong debate west germanys richard jaeger said it was 
the first time that the rights of the unborn child are recognized 
in an international convention chinas li zuomin said his 
government interpreted the definition of a child as not including 
a fetus before birth 
several speakers expressed concern at another key article which 
commits signatories to take all feasible measures to ensure that 
persons who have not attained the age of 15 do not take a direct 
part in hostilities 
australia belgium and sweden were among those criticizing that 
this offers less protection than existing international norms 
including an additional protocol to the geneva conventions which 
says that children under 15 must not be allowed to take part in 
hostilities 
the observer of the international committee of the red cross 
speaking last said the drafts article even weakens international 
humanitarian law and introduces ambiguities 
the drafts 54 articles include many basic human rights already 
laid down in other internationally binding accords specific 
provisions commit signatories to protect children against all 
forms of sexual exploitation and to prevent the abduction sale 
of or trafficking in children 
one article includes a reference to childrens right to receive 
and impart information of all kinds through any media of the 
childs choice but adds that this right may be subject to 
certain restrictions 
the west german delegate commented that a clarification taking 
into account parents rights would have been urgently required 
because i am sure that no one in this room believes that children 
should be allowed to watch tv for unlimited hours 
australias quentin bryce said that concern voiced by some 
parents that the accord may undermine their relationship with their 
children was unfounded the convention makes abundantly clear the 
primary responsibility of parents for their children she said 
the general assembly will have to decide on funds needed for 
setting up a special committee that is to monitor implementation of 
the convention

actress meryl streep and the washington 
apple industry squared off in a bicoastal battle wednesday over the 
movie stars talk show appearances warning against eating 
alartreated apples 
ms streep has little scientific knowledge about the chemical 
daminozide sold under the name alar and should not go on 
television denouncing it said chris schlect a washington fruit 
industry lobbyist based in yakima 
the academy awardwinning actress a founder of the group mothers 
and others for pesticide limits has appeared on the today and 
donahue shows and other programs recently denouncing the use of 
alar 
she is not a phd from harvard said schlect head of the 
northwest horticultural council she is not knowledgeable about 
why farmers use products or what would happen if they were not 
used 
ms streep acknowledged her lack of scientific training in an 
interview wednesday but said that was not the issue 
im not a scientist so i have to go with the best information 
available ms streep told the associated press in a telephone 
interview from her agents office in new york i eat them and i 
feed them to her three children so i am involved in the apple 
issue 
im not interested in beating up on farmers im interested in 
farmers being supported to grow in ways not threatening to health 
said ms streep whose group is tied in with the natural resources 
defense council a washingtonbased nonprofit consumer watchdog 
agency 
although the safety of alar has been debated for years the 
latest flareup began feb 26 when the cbs news program 60 
minutes aired a story on a report by the nrdc titled intolerable 
risk pesticides in our childrens food 
the nrdc released the report the next day saying that 5500 to 
6200 preschoolers were projected to get cancer sometime in their 
lives as a result of childhood exposure to six to eight chemicals 
used in fruits and vegetables 
the report found the greatest risk from udmh a breakdown product 
of daminozide also known as alar preschoolers consume six times 
more fruit than the average adult and the nrdc estimated that the 
average preschoolers cancer risk from exposure to udmh in their 
first six years was approximately one case for every 4000 
preschoolers exposed 
that report touched off an uproar in the apple industry and also 
among some scientists and the us environmental protection agency 
who said it was misleading and alarmist 
alar is not a pesticide it is a chemical growth regulator that 
is sprayed on apple trees after they blossom it works internally to 
improve the color and firmness of apples mainly by keeping them on 
the tree longer that extends shelf life and also gives growers a 
longer harvest time which can be critical in times of labor 
shortage 
the epa proposed a ban on alar earlier this decade although it 
did not go through with that however the epa announced earlier 
this year that it planned to take steps towards banning alar by 1990 
because of the results of preliminary cancer tests on rats 
to combat the tv blitz by ms streep and the nrdc the washington 
apple commission a growerfinanced group announced wednesday that 
it had spent 1 million on fullpage ads that will appear friday in 
new york washington dc and los angeles papers as well as usa 
today 
its unfortunate shes using the emotions she can evoke in 
consumers against products and making opinions not based on 
fact commission spokeswoman vicky scharlau said of ms streep 
washington is the nations leading apple producer growing about 
half of the nations supermarket apples 
also wednesday the head of the american council on science and 
health said groups calling for an end to chemicals in farming are 
naive and a major national threat to security 
dr elizabeth whelan of the new yorkbased group of 250 
scientists said abandoning chemicals would leave the nations food 
supply vulnerable to the whims of nature 
meryl streep is not going to tell them the public the 
consequences of not using alar ms whelan said adding that 
nature is full of carcinogens and that alar has not been proven to 
cause cancer 
the earlier alar controversy had prompted the apple industry to 
severely cut its use of alar fearing a consumer backlash the apple 
commission has said only about 5 percent of the total apple acreage 
is treated with the chemical 
ms streep said the 5 percent figure may not be accurate 
she noted that consumer reports magazine found alar in 23 of 32 
apple juice samples it tested last year although all the producers 
contended they use alarfree apples 
schlect argued that the alar content in the apple juice samples 
was below the allowable federal limits and was leftover traces from 
past alar use

the sandinista newspaper claimed 
wednesday that usbacked rebels based in honduras are mobilizing 
for attacks across the border 
it cited unidentified sources close to the rebel leadership 
in the honduran capital tegucigalpa the defense ministry said it 
had no information other than the report in barricada the official 
newspaper of ruling leftist party 
an estimated 11000 of the rebels known as contras the bulk of 
the ussupported force are in honduran camps in the border area 
with their families 
in honduras foreign minister carlos lopez contreras said 
wednesday the rebel army should not be disbanded and its fighters 
repatriated to nicaragua until the sandinista government fulfills 
its promise of democratic reforms 
that implied a longer period for dismantling the rebel force and 
greater linkage to reforms in nicaragua than suggested by an 
agreement the presidents of costa rica el salvador guatemala 
honduras and nicaragua signed feb 14 
lopez contreras urged the united states to continue humanitarian 
aid to the contras while they remain in honduras 
an armed group devoid of humanitarian assistance and 
concentrated on our border is a great danger to the security of 
honduras he told a news conference 
the rebels are in the border province of el paraiso in camps near 
yamales about 280 miles from tegucigalpa 
a 27 million us humanitarian aid package runs out march 31 
some members of congress have proposed linking more aid which 
president bush says he will request to the central american summit 
agreement the united states halted military aid in february 1988 
central american presidents agreed at the february 1314 summit 
in el salvador to develop a plan for dismantling the contra force 
and repatriating its members or relocating them presumably outside 
the region 
they called for international verification of the accord which 
contains provisions for early elections and democratic reforms in 
nicaragua 
morris busby special us envoy to central america met with 
lopez contreras and president jose azcona hoyo on tuesday night and 
told them the united states wants the contras to return to 
nicaragua the foreign minister said 
repatriation would benefit the contras lopez contreras said 
it would benefit nicaragua because it could achieve democracy as 
the condition for repatration and honduras wouldnt have any more 
armed groups or nicaraguan refugees in its territory so everyone 
wins 
barricada said tuesday the contras were moving deeper into 
honduras to avoid detection by international observers who have not 
yet been deployed contra leaders in miami denied the report 
on wednesday the paper said 6000 contras commanded by former 
col enrique bermudez had moved out of the jungle camps to strategic 
points on the border 
it said they were preparing for offensive actions against 
nicaraguan targets not demobilization the contras have not agreed 
to the summit demobilization plan 
bermudez said during the summit that some rebels might return to 
nicaragua and continue the war even without us military aid 
the contras and sandinistas signed a temporary ceasefire a year 
ago and comparatively little fighting has been reported since

health and human services secretary louis 
sullivan said wednesday he would readily reverse his decision to 
forfeit nearly 300000 in severance pay if congress and the white 
house determine the money would raise no ethical concerns 
a senate committee is looking into the matter with the white 
house after members expressed concern that sullivan was making an 
undue sacrifice by his decison not to take the payment to avoid any 
potential conflicts of interest 
i would readily reverse that decision because as some of them 
put it im not a wealthy man sullivan said in an interview with 
the associated press 
certainly thats a benefit thats accrued over 13 years that i 
would certainly love to be able to enjoy especially at this 
particular time in this town said sullivan whose annual salary 
dropped from 172000 last year to 89500 in the new job 
but sullivan said he would not reverse his decision until the 
after the senate finance committee completes its review 
the severance pay was earned under sullivans contract with the 
morehouse school of medicine in atlanta which he founded upon his 
confirmation to the bush cabinet last week he stepped down as the 
schools president and took an unpaid leave of absence as a 
professor of medicine 
he had asked permission to take a paid sabbatical while at hhs 
but the white house determined the schools policy on paid leave did 
not meet government ethical standards 
the office of government ethics found no ethics problems with the 
severance payment but sullivan decided to give up the money before 
the white house position was formalized 
sullivan said his decision was in reaction to news reports at the 
time that were raising questions about his request for a paid leave 
last week at sullivans confirmation hearing members of the 
senate finance committee said the sacrifice was unnecessary unfair 
and could discourage others from taking government jobs

alexander dubcek the former communist 
leader of czechoslovakia attacked his countrys recent jailing of 
dissidents and said no reform in czechoslvakia is possible unless 
the events of 1968 are reviewed 
as communist party chief dubcek led the liberal reforms known as 
the prague spring which were crushed by a sovietled invasion in 
august 1968 
in an interview broadcast tuesday night dubcek was quoted as 
telling the british broadcasting corp and voice of america radio 
it is impossible to start out on a new road unless you have looked 
at everything behind you 
this refusal to look the truth about 1968 in the eye is 
preventing the party and maybe the leadership from recognizing 
that it is not possible to move forward with perestroika 
restructuring of society and the economy until you fill in the 
blank spots of history 
dubcek was interviewed on feb 24 in czechoslovakia a transcript 
of his remarks was made available wednesday by the bbc in london 
he was also quoted as criticizing the jailing of playwright and 
human rights activist vaclav havel and others after antigovernment 
protests were put down by police in the czechoslovak capital in 
january 
dubcek called the unrest a surface phenomenon caused by the 
burden of the last 20 years according to the transcript 
havel was given a ninemonth sentence on feb 21 seven other 
dissidents were tried that week one was sentenced to a year in 
prison one to nine months and five received suspended sentences 
and fines 
all seven were charged with hooliganism after they tried to lay 
flowers in memory of jan palach a czechoslovak student who burned 
himself to death in 1969 to protest the 1968 invasion and the death 
of reform in his homeland 
there is a serious issue here and that is that this legal 
system here does not adhere to the democratic rules of the game or 
to the democratic rules of law dubcek reportedly said 
on thursday cultural activists ivan jirous and jiri tichy face a 
court in the moravian town of jihlava in czechoslovakia on charges 
of antistate activity that could jail them for up to five years 
milos jakes the current communist party leader and other 
prominent members of the czechoslovak leadership continue to say the 
1968 invasion was justified because dubceks reforms threatened the 
socialist system 
the refusal to reevaluate was reiterated in an interview 
published last month in the soviet weekly moscow news with zdenek 
horeni editor of the czechoslovak party newspaper rude pravo 
moscow news editor yegor yakovlev had asked pointedly whether the 
time had come to reevaluate the events of 1968 
those events are over and done with we will not return to 
their reappraisal at any rate our generation horeni replied 
there is no inner need for this 
indications have grown in soviet news media of some impatience in 
moscow with pragues refusal to introduce more reform and with its 
handling of the unprecedented week of antigovernment protests in 
prague in january

rebels fighting the marxist government of 
mozambique are still getting aid from south africa a state 
department official said wednesday 
but alison rosenberg deputy assistant secretary for africa said 
she didnt know the source of the money or how much was being sent 
weve done our best to publicize our views in mozambique and 
weve told the south africans of our concern ms rosenberg told 
the house foreign affairs african subcommittee 
the mozambique national resistance known by its portuguese 
acronym of renam0 has been fighting the government for 12 years 
starting shortly after the nation won independence from portugal 
thousands of portuguese colonists fled mozambique to neighboring 
south africa and many support renamo 
the mozambique news agency aim says 600000 people most of them 
children have died as a result of the fighting refugees estimated 
at 800000 to 1 million have fled to malawi 
mozambique and malawi are among the worlds poorest countries 
the average citizen earns about 150 a year according to the world 
bank 
but edward v k jaycox the banks vice president for africa 
listed both among the african countries where incomes are beginning 
to improve after a decade or more of decline at a news conference 
wednesday he singled out malawi for what he called a tremendous 
performance despite the burden of caring for the refugees 
south africa where the average annual income reached 1890 in 
1987 is among the most prosperous african countries 
in 1984 mozambique and south africa agreed that south african 
aid to the rebels would cease and mozambique would expel guerrillas 
of the african national congress who attack south africa 
we support the accord ms rosenberg said 
the mozambique government has charged south africa with violating 
the agreement 
last month us officials welcomed a call by south african 
foreign minister pik botha for the united states to mediate the 
fighting e gibson lanpher the state departments top official for 
southern africa said he wanted to find out if bothas proposal 
included renamo 
botha said he envisioned negotiations like those of last year on 
southwest africa they included representatives of cuba angola 
south africa and us mediators and resulted in an agreement that 
south africa would begin the grant of independence to namibia on 
april 1

an unpredictable economy not the 
stewardship of former gov john sununu is responsible for new 
hampshires cash crisis gov judd gregg said wednesday 
i was left with a very strong state an extremely positive 
fiscal situation gregg said 
gregg commented in response to reports that sununu now white 
house chief of staff left gregg with the same financial problems 
for which sununu denounced massachusetts gov michael dukakis during 
the presidential campaign 
sununu forecast a 10 million budget surplus in his departing 
speech to the legislature in january five days later gregg warned 
of a potential 13 million deficit when he cut most state spending 3 
percent 
the sudden turnaround prompted democrats to accuse sununu of 
masking a deficit to make himself look good and dukakis bad 
the potential deficit was based on revenue projections that are 
still in debate also the legislature underfunded several programs 
last spring when it wrote a supplemental budget for 1989 
legislative leadership said then that better revenue and cost 
estimates would be available in january to use in adjusting the 
estimated 571 million general fund budget a supplemental spending 
bill to ensure the state ends the year in the black is still under 
consideration 
when it appeared agencies were spending more than legislators 
estimated out of their 1988 budgets sununu privately twisted arms 
last spring to produce 24 million in lapses appropriated but 
unspent funds 
that left the state with a 13 million surplus last july 1 
usually criticized for being overly cautious in his revenue 
estimates sununu says early receipts made him feel confident the 
state would take in more revenues than estimated by the legislature 
in april greggs january estimate also was lower than sununus 
sununus estimate of how much agencies would return to the 
treasury on june 30 also was higher than greggs 
when gregg announced the turnaround he deducted for underfunded 
programs and used revenue and lapse estimates that were 13 million 
less than those projected by sununu 
gregg said in an interview last month that sununu still could 
have been optimistic into december that his estimates were correct 
and if i were a departing governor i suspect i would have been 
a key element in the equation are the lapses in his six years in 
office sununus taskmaster style of management produced the results 
he sought 
in an interview last week sununu said he felt we still would 
have been able to manage it and that based on revenue estimates 
when he left a small surplus would have been left even after those 
bills he felt had to be paid were deducted 
though he warned aggressive management would be required to 
ensure any of the 10 million was left on june 30 sununu didnt 
mention the debts when he talked about a surplus 
critics say that painted too rosy a picture but sununu says they 
werent listening closely 
for folks to say i didnt say revenues were tight is just not 
true he says i was the one who said it was going to be a 
tough tough biennium 
gregg reiterated wednesday that sununu wasnt to blame 
i dont point the finger of blame at anyone he said i 
think we are caught in a situation where revenues are falling it 
was an unpredictable situation i dont think it was poor 
management 
gregg praised fellow republican sununu and new hampshires 
republicancontrolled legislature for prudent use of state funds 
during sununus three terms as governor 
we had very good stewardship over the last six years he said 
gregg said sununus criticism of masschusetts was justified 
while new hampshire spent supluses on onetime projects such as the 
land conservation program dukakis spent large sums on new programs 
that have to be funded or cut in lean times he said 
gregg predicted the universal health care program enacted by 
massachusetts is going to bankrupt that state in my opinion

a house committee gave partyline approval 
wednesday to legislation that would require large employers to 
provide up to 10 weeks of unpaid leave for parents to take care of 
newborn or seriously ill children 
the bill a major part of congressional democrats domestic 
agenda also would require companies with 50 or more employees to 
grant similar leave to workers who need extended time off to take 
care of ailing parents 
and it would require them to give up to 15 weeks of unpaid leave 
for the workers own serious illness 
in each instance the only direct cost to the employer would be 
to continue whatever companypaid health benefits were in force at 
the time the worker requested leave 
however many private and public employers including the 
national league of cities oppose the measure on grounds it would be 
overly disruptive to their operations to hold jobs open for workers 
requesting such extended leaves even though the direct financial 
cost might be minimal 
the measure cleared the house education and labor committee on a 
2312 vote at the end of a daylong meeting in which the panel beat 
back about two dozen republicansponsored amendments 
the bill is expected to be scheduled for floor debate in may 
after facing review by the house post office and civil service 
committee 
only two major amendments were adopted wednesday one to include 
congressional offices and another to exempt public elementary and 
secondary schools from some of the measures provisions 
the amendment applying to public schools was sponsored by rep 
marge roukema rnj who offered it at the urging of the national 
school boards association 
she read panel members a letter from the association in which it 
agreed to drop its opposition to the overall bill if the amendment 
it sought was adopted 
arguing that whatever was fair for public schools was fair for 
private schools rep steve bartlett rtexas attempted to amend 
ms roukemas amendment to spell that out 
he was defeated 2510 
later bartlett attempted to have the bill spell out that the 
same special considerations that public schools could apply to 
teachers on leave mainly special leeway in offering them 
equivalent work rather than the same work would extend to police 
and fire departments and public health agencies 
again he was defeated 2510

the justice minister appealed to 
parliament on wednesday for a system of checks and balances to be 
enshrined in hungarys new constitution and repeatedly cited the 
us constitution as an example 
in presenting the main principles of the new constitution 
justice minister kalman kulcsar said the drafters of the us 
constitution faced many of the same pitfalls hungary confronts today 
the constitution which would mark a significant break from the 
current 1949 constitution modeled after the soviet one is to 
guarantee civil and human rights and the existence of various 
parties 
parliament which began its session wednesday also was told by 
premier miklos nemeth that the government will consider calling a 
referendum on its highly controversial danube power project 
it was the first indication hungary might consider withdrawing 
from the gabcikovonagymaros project which it is building jointly 
with czechoslovakia and with austrian financial backing 
environmentalists in hungary argue that the project will cause 
irreparable damage to the river 
a new law on referendums is due in june it is part of a package 
of political reforms designed to complement the new constitution 
which is to be adopted by referendum early next year

rail announced wednesday 
the state network bowed to a furious campaign by residents in 
southeast london and picturesque kent who said demolition along the

the changes will increase the cost of the rail link project from 
2 billion to 29 billion british rail said 
the route wont be ready until the late 1990s so existing 
railway tracks and lower speeds on the england side will have to be 
used when the channel tunnel now being built to link england and

the world within a world that biologist 
abigale alling entered wednesday is landlocked high and dry in the 
spectacular landscape of the desert 
but organizers of her fiveday test run in the selfcontained 
environment believe it could lead to the stars 
i feel like a pioneer in here ms alling said in a 
videotaped hookup with reporters in a nearby conference room it 
is another world and a world apart from where you are it is a 
remarkable feat 
her experiment will be the longest test so far of the airlock a 
humaninhabited module independent of the air water and nutrients 
of earth 
the experiment is the first major test of plans for the much 
bigger biosphere ii the largest closed ecosystem ever attempted 
eight biospherians intend to enter that structure in 1990 for a 
twoyear stay 
if the 30 million project succeeds space biospheres ventures 
plans to sell versions to governments and researchers to preserve 
endangered species or for research or space colonization said 
spokeswoman kathleen dyhr 
ms allings abbreviated module stocked with flora and fauna is 
a steelframed greenhouse with a 20foot ceiling over a 
23by23foot base its 15000 cubic feet would be about the size of 
a twostory tworoom house 
biosphere ii by contrast will have 5 million cubic feet under 
glass or about 2 acres 
lack of room forced planners to omit chicken fish and goats from 
the test and ms alling will not be able to eat the full array of 
fruits and vegetables of the larger experiment but ms dyhr said 
she would take in 2500 calories a day from 29 plant species 
including potatoes beans carrots strawberries and papayas 
other members of the animal kingdom in the fiveday test are 
snails insects and two fish 
air circulation works on a system similar to biosphere iis hot 
air will rise over the desert section of the module pick up 
moisture then fall as rain solar fans and a turbine will send air 
back over the desert to begin the cycle again plants will exchange 
oxygen for the carbon dioxide given off by humans 
ms alling a 29yearold marinemammal scientist with a masters 
degree from yale university is a coordinator for biosphere ii she 
will monitor systems inside while project managers outside do the 
same as well as record ms allings heart and respiration rate and 
other vital signs 
her living quarters will be kept private through use of blinds 
will consist of an efficiency kitchen bathroom with shower bed and 
a desk in a study area 
ms alling said she would be on a tight schedule each day rising 
at 7 am to harvest and cook her food then doing computer work on 
biosphere ii which will feature a 35footdeep ocean as one of its 
seven separate environmental systems 
she will be in touch with the outside through a telephone and 
computer electronic mail and the study has books and a 
videocassette recorder 
ill even be able to watch saturday night movies ms alling 
said 
she said that during preparation she had learned to enjoy the 
enclosed environment it has the wonderful smell of a rich 
tropical rain forest ms alling said 
eight biospherians are scheduled to enter biosphere ii in 
1990 for a twoyear stay 
the aim of biosphere ii is to see if humans can exist in a 
selfregulating world with its own climate it has desert ocean 
farmed land marsh savanna jungle and human habitats in a 
sixstory building resembling a mosque 
basically its an experiment to test the systems in terms of 
maintaining the environment the atmosphere particularly said 
dyhr 
there have been 2 years of unmanned studies in the test module 
and there was a threeday manned study

mayorelect peter clavelle promised 
wednesday to continue pushing the agenda of retiring socialist mayor 
bernard sanders though perhaps with a lower voice 
clavelle the citys director of economic development won 
election tuesday under the banner of sanders progressive coalition 
party defeating a democratic rival by a 53to42 percent margin 
i think what the people of burlington have said yesterday is 
that weve had progressive government for the past eight years and 
its been good government clavelle said at a news conference 
while eschewing the socialist label that made sanders something 
of a celebrity clavelle said in an interview that he favors such 
leftist goals as workplace democracy and a shift from military to 
social spending 
those who have the money and those who have the power tend to 
represent themselves pretty well clavelle said adding that he 
sees the job of mayor as being the one who tips the scales just a 
little bit toward those without money and power 
clavelle showed surprising strength in traditionally democratic 
and republican wards in his victory over democrat nancy chioffi he 
received 5626 votes to her 4400 votes 
two minor party candidates split a few hundred other votes 
clavelle 39 is the grandson of frenchcanadians who came south 
to work in the woolen mills of neighboring winooski he said he gets 
his politics from his workingclass background not from marxist 
theory 
his term begins april 1 
sanders 47 who ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1986 and for 
congress last year announced in december that he would leave 
politics to teach and write he doesnt rule out another try for 
elective office 
he was first elected mayor in 1981 and won three subsequent 
twoyear terms he is the only avowed socialist mayor in the nation

two british soldiers were killed 
and six others injured when a guerrilla land mine exploded under 
their jeeps wednesday night in londonderry northern irelands 
secondlargest city police reported 
no group immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion fell 
on the irish republican army fighting british rule in northern 
ireland 
sgt john brown a police spokesman in belfast said the soldiers 
were in a patrol traveling north out of the city in two armored land 
rover jeeps shortly before midnight when a massive land mine 
exploded 
he said the second of the two jeeps took the main force of the 
blast 
security forces sealed off the area after the blast 
no other details were immediately available 
the mainly roman catholic ira wants to unite the predominantly 
protestant province with the 95 percent catholic republic of ireland 
under socialist rule 
earlier wednesday the ira issued a statement saying two elderly 
men killed a day earlier in a triple murder at a gas station were 
slain by mistake it said the targets were three protestants 
allegedly questioned by police about recent attacks on roman 
catholics 
in london home secretary douglas hurd said the ira plans a 
bombing blitz in britain using large quantities of explosives and 
arms supplied by libya 
hurds warning followed discovery of an arms and explosives cache 
at scarborough northeast england that caused speculation the ira 
will try to kill prime minister margaret thatcher during a 
conservative party conference there march 1718 
party leaders confirmed wednesday the meeting of the partys 
national council would be held as planned at the spa conference 
center in scarborough government sources said mrs thatcher and 
other cabinet ministers were determined to defy the threat 
an ira bomb attack oct 12 1984 at the annual conservative 
convention in the south coast resort of brighton killed five people 
but mrs thatcher was not hurt 
while answering questions in the house of commons hurd said 
the provisional ira have a substantial amount of arms and 
explosives which they got from libya 
these arms and explosives are concealed they are being found 
quite regularly in ireland north and south now they are being 
found in london and north yorkshire 
he said it was too early to tell if the arms were linked to an 
ira bomb factory police discovered dec 21 in clapham south london 
tom king the northern ireland secretary said the intention 
of the ira is to kill maim and murder wherever they find easy 
targets and where carnage can be created 
he cited the latest discovery in proposing the annual renewal of 
tough antiterrorism measures for northern ireland the vote to 
renew was 239118 
in its statement about tuesdays killings in coagh village 
county tyrone the ira said violinmaker austin nelson 62 and 
pensioner ernie rankin 72 were shot down in the general 
confusion it said they had no paramilitary connections 
the third man killed station owner leslie dallas was in the 
ulster volunteer force an outlawed protestant paramilitary group 
the ira said 
two other men dived safely for cover police denied those men and 
dallas had been questioned about protestant attacks and said the 
men named as the other two targets were not at the scene

the number of venereal disease cases in china has 
quadrupled annually in recent years because of increased 
prostitution sexual freedom and contacts with the outside world 
chinas official news agency said wednesday 
xinhua news agency said the problem is particularly serious 
because the sexually transmitted diseases were practically 
nonexistent in china for decades and few doctors know how to 
diagnose or treat them 
the report did not give any nationwide figures but it said 
national disease prevention and research center statistics showed an 
average 312 percent annual growth in vd cases in recent years it 
did not say how many years 
it said canton chinas most open city because of its proximity 
to hong kong recorded 10000 vd cases between 1984 and september 
last year 
the semiofficial china news service said wednesday that a 
1dayold boy in canton recently was found to have been born with 
gonorrhea contracted from his father it said he was the ninth child 
in the city confirmed to be suffering from vd 
according to statistics from venereal disease centers in 16 
cities 705 percent of sufferers are male about 77 percent are 
gonorrhea cases while 1677 percent are syphilis 
the return of vd was attributed to greater sexual freedom that 
has broken barriers against premarital sex more contacts with the 
outside world and the rampancy of prostitution in some areas 
xinhua quoted the daily health news as saying some women are 
becoming prostitutes simply to make money while others are forced 
into prostitution by gangs and some are frustrated in love and 
ignorant about sex 
before the communist takeover in 1949 an estimated 10 million 
people in in china had vd 500000 in shanghai alone 
but the communist government eradicated prostitution in the early 
1950s and in the early 1960s it claimed that vd no longer existed 
in china 
health news said that because china was vdfree for so long 
chapters on the diseases were left out off medical books and doctors 
are not able to recognize or treat them fake medicine dealers and 
charlatans are exploiting some people afraid to go to hospitals with 
their problems it said 
in the past few years china has set up 192 treatment and 
prevention agencies throughout the country and established a 
national center in nanking

a 4yearold boy playing with a heater 
accidentally set a fire wednesday that engulfed a wood frame house 
and triggered an explosion that killed one firefighter and 
critically burned two others officials said 
authorities said the flash over a detonation of gases 
produced by combustion pushed the temperature in the house to over 
1000 degrees melting the clothes and protective gear off the three 
firefighters 
firefighter jeffrey n lindsey 23 a fouryear veteran whose 
brother helped fight the same fire was the first oklahoma city 
firefighter to die while fighting a fire since 1950 fire chief tom 
smith said 
bennie d zellner 44 and jimmy l ayers 46 were hospitalized 
in critical condition with second and thirddegree burns covering 
70 percent to 90 percent of their bodies officials said two other 
firefighters sustained minor injuries 
the heat was so bad it disintegrated everything they were 
wearing said dr peter silverstein of the baptist medical center 
burn center who estimated their exposure at 1000 degrees smith 
said the temperature was probably even higher 
these guys are young healthy men and we expect that their 
vital organs will give us a good fight and keep going silverstein 
said physiologically they stand the best chances of anybody of 
surviving 
the fire in a frame house in southwest oklahoma city was started 
in a closet by a child who was playing with wood in an openfaced 
heater fire officials said 
smith said the childs mother tried to put the fire out with 
water before going to neighbors homes to call the fire department 
the fire chief said the three firefighters were wearing full 
protective gear but that the explosive intensity of the fire was 
too hot for it to prevent the burns 
there is nothing on the market that would have protected them 
under those conditions he said 
officials said american and state flags at all the fire stations 
were lowered to halfstaff wednesday in honor of lindsey 
smith said funeral services have not been scheduled for lindsey 
who is survived by his wife melissa lindsey who is expecting their 
first child

security forces dragged tibetans from their 
houses wednesday as thousands of chinese troops took up posts around 
lhasa after three days of antichinese riots travelers said 
by official count 12 people had been killed and more than 100 
wounded in violence since sunday when tibetans marched in lhasa 
demanding an end to nearly four decades of communist rule and the 
return of their spiritual leader the dalai lama travelers quoted 
tibetans as saying the actual death toll was much higher 
the dalai lamas governmentinexile in india offered to hold 
talks with china to discuss the future of tibet the chinese embassy 
in new delhi refused comment 
china on thursday accused tibetan separatists living abroad of 
smuggling weapons into tibet and instigating riots in lhasa the 
tibetan capital in a commentary the official xinhua news agency 
also defended chinas human rights record in tibet saying it is 
those opposed to chinese rule who trample on the rights of the 
tibetan people 
foreign witnesses to this weeks rioting said they saw no 
tibetans with weapons 
china also announced further martial law orders all foreigners 
must report to police tibetans harboring criminals must turn them 
in and peoples armed police will continue to suppress and root out 
separatists 
no reports surfaced of further demonstrations or gunfire on 
wednesday and early thursday but westerners in lhasa said troops 
filled the streets 
beginning at midnight tuesday trucks with loudspeakers drove 
through the city of 70000 announcing martial law was in effect and 
ordering tibetans to stay inside said foreign travelers most of 
whom spoke on condition of anonymity 
the foreigners gave the following account 
dozens of trucks packed with soldiers entered the city and troops 
some drinking beer set up checkpoints 15 miles outside lhasa and 
at nearly every block in the city soldiers stopped all but official 
vehicles and arrested tibetans in the streets 
they were just collaring people and stuffing them into 
jeeps said an american 
tibetans screamed with fright as chinese troops pulled them from 
their homes 
these were womens voices said an australian the truck 
kept coming back they would pick up a couple people drive off with 
a halfdozen militia holding them down then come back 
it was not known who the people were why they were picked up or 
how widespread the roundups were because the foreigners were 
confined to their hotels but foreigners contacted at several hotels 
said they saw police raiding the homes of ordinary tibetans along 
the streets in front of their hotels 
mobs led by tibetan youths ransacked chinese shops in three days 
of rioting through tuesday and a european traveler said not one 
chineseowned shop in the old quarter of the city escaped damage 
the estimated 150 foreigners in lhasa have been ordered to leave 
the city by noon thursday but they were forbidden wednesday to 
leave their hotels to buy tickets 
tourists said they were given a choice of going to nepal by bus 
going to other cities in tibet or flying to chengdu 
one traveler said soldiers stopped her and five others from 
catching a chartered bus for nepal officials later told her they 
had arranged another bus to the border but wanted 4185 three 
times the previous price she said 
they can shoot people and arrest people but getting you a 
ticket and helping you change money is beyond their capacity said 
one american 
the travelers spoke in telephone interviews from lhasa to 
chengdu the capital of neighboring sichuan province and one of the 
few points of entry to the remote himalayan region 
police detained two british reporters overnight jasper becker of 
the guardian newspaper said he and a reporter for the reuters news 
agency were released wednesday after being questioned with 
authorities most concerned about photographs 
one swiss who refused to turn over his film sunday said police 
beat him and pointed a gun at his head he said the police still had 
his camera and passport and wouldnt return them until he hands over 
the film and pays a fine he said he was not injured 
three swedes and an american who also took pictures were given 
back their cameras and passports after they paid fines 
the imposition of martial law marked the first time chinese 
authorities had taken the step anywhere since the 196676 cultural 
revolution 
authorities apparently took the measure to prevent demonstrations 
on friday anniversary of the failed uprising that led the dalai 
lama to flee to india in 1959 
the violence that began sunday was the fourth clash in 18 months 
between chinese security forces and tibetans troops were not 
deployed in the previous episodes in which at least 40 tibetans and 
police were killed 
china claims tibet has been part of china since the 13th century 
but many tibetans maintain the territory was an independent nation 
before the communists took over in 1949 
in new delhi the dalai lamas governmentinexile said it was 
ready to work for a peaceful solution to the unrest

the organizers of a college basketball 
tournament stand to lose up to 50000 this week because a measles 
outbreak has forced them to hold the games in an empty 15000seat 
arena 
officials at the host university of hartford have juggled 
schedules canceled events and asked fans to donate the cost of 
their unused tickets but despite their efforts the events winners 
who must bear the greatest share of the loss could be financial 
losers 
if i was to put ink to paper right now id estimate those 
losses are going to be 30000 to 50000 university of hartford 
athletic director don cook said wednesday 
the tournament to pick the winner of the east coast athletic 
conferences north atlantic conference is scheduled to start 
thursday and end sunday 
a hartford basketball players case of measles and an outbreak of 
the highly contagious disease on the campus of siena college 
another nac member prompted the spectator ban 
hartford as host is fronting the money for the tournament any 
losses will be reimbursed from proceeds the winning team receives 
from the national collegiate athletic association the winner 
receives an automatic bid to the ncaa tournament worth just more 
than 250000 this year cook said 
the first priority in distributing the 250000 is 
administrative the winning team gets 50 percent of the balance and 
the remaining 50 percent is shared by the other nine member schools 
cook said organizers would have a better estimate of losses once 
they know how many of hartfords 2000 season ticketholders ask for 
refunds on their 18 tournament tickets 
weve had people who have donated their tickets or their 
money he said weve had others that ask for refunds 
meanwhile tournament organizers have done their best to see that 
no one else gets the measles 
players will be met by a tournament delegate at their hotel and 
led through a service entrance into the civic center where the 
games will be played cook said 
reporters covering the tournament will be asked to prove theyve

premier andreas papandreou on wednesday 
denied any involvement in a financial scandal rocking the country 
and called it an international conspiracy to topple his socialist 
government 
in a 15minute televised address to the nation papandreou also 
said he will sue the us news magazine time for defamation both in 
greece and abroad over an interview it carried with the fugitive 
banker george koskotas 
i felt the need to communicate with you because for the first 
time in my political life my character is being doubted i want 
to make clear that not a trace of the mud that is flying from all 
quarters involves me the 70yearold leader said 
in the magazine report koskotas the former chairman of the 
privatelyowned bank of crete accused papandreou and other senior 
socialist leaders of demanding and receiving millions of dollars in 
payoffs from his bank 
the 34yearold banker who rose to fame creating a publishing 
empire in just four years fled the country in november after being 
indicted in the 200 million fraud forgery and embezzlement scandal 
time ran the story in its march 13 issue following a series of 
six interviews with the financier in a boston prison where he is 
awaiting an extradition hearing scheduled for march 16 
time is a magazine of the american establishment now we 
can see clearly which forces are hiding behind the attempts to 
uproot democracy in our country papandreou said in the address 
papandreou added that the attempts to overthrow his government 
will continue up until the june 1989 general elections 
the koskotas affair has spurred both the conservative and 
communist opposition parties to call for the leaders immediate 
resignation 
the government has also come under increasing attack from members 
of the ruling panhellenic socialist movement pasok for its 
handling of the scandal in the five months since the scandal first 
emerged it has triggered the resignations of seven cabinet members 
although the government has maintained from the start that the 
allegations were part of a domestic and foreigninspired plot to 
usurp papandreou from power it has avoided naming the forces behind 
it 
recent opinion polls have indicated that papandreous popularity 
has declined sharply in the past six months because of his highly 
public extramarital liasion with a former air hostess 
the premier who underwent open heart surgery in london last 
fall made the address from his suburban home in kastri he has been 
living with his 34yearold girlfriend in a nearby villa since his 
return from the british capital 
papandreous televised address was delayed when journalists went 
on a threehour strike the walkout was called by the union of 
athens journalists at the two staterun television channels to 
protest the governments alleged monopoly of the medium and the 
behavior of state officials toward the news media

four more democratic senators turned down the 
white house on wednesday and declared their opposition to john tower 
to be defense secretary but republican leader bob dole tried to 
stave off defeat by proposing an extraordinary sixmonth trial 
confirmation 
dole said the trial period would let senators judge whether tower 
lived up to his nodrinking pledge senate democratic leader george 
mitchell expressed immediate serious concerns over the proposal 
but promised to consider it overnight 
dole made his dramatic bid to salvage the nomination at the end 
of the fifth day of a draining senate debate and it followed the 
decision by four more democrats to vote against tower giving 
opponents of tower a majority 
dole conceded it would take a miracle to win confirmation 
under doles proposal tower would be confirmed but would submit 
a letter of resignation to president bush dated oct 1 1989 if 
towers performance were satisfactory there probably would be 
no need to reconfirm him dole said otherwise he probably 
wouldnt be the nominee 
dole said he offered his proposal after discussing it with tower 
it came as the senate neared a climax in its bitter struggle over 
the nomination 
lloyd bentsen of texas became the third democrat to endorse 
towers confirmation but his speech was bracketed by declarations 
of opposition from claiborne pell of rhode island bennett johnston 
of louisiana joseph lieberman of connecticut and charles robb of 
virginia democrats who had been lobbied hard by the bush 
administration as potential protower votes 
an associated press survey found 51 democrats and republican sen 
larry pressler of south dakota either solidly opposed or leaning 
against confirmation with 41 republicans and three democrats either 
supporting or leaning in favor of the nomination 
democrats hold a 5545 edge in the senate 
dole made his extraordinary proposal to deal with senate concerns 
over towers history of drinking i think we ought to give him a 
second chance that many of us have had said dole who was 
seriously wounded during world war ii but has risen to a position of 
power and prominence in the senate 
it gives this senate a second opportunity it addresses the 
concerns raised by the chairman and the majority leader and by 
others at the same time it gives president bush his choice for 
secretary of defense dole said 
earlier dole suggested tower be permitted to come to the senate 
and answer the allegations against him but did not immediately 
press the issue when mitchell objected 
there was little doubt that doles maneuverings were his final 
bid to save the nomination earlier he conceded it would take a 
miracle to do so and johnstons speech seemed to deflate 
republican hopes 
in the nuclear age we cant afford to take a chance on the man 
who holds the future in his hands johnston said on the senate 
floor 
the louisiana democrat said he was troubled by towers drinking 
habits and noted that alcohol altered the former senators judgment 
there seems to be a personality change that occurs in senator 
tower johnston said 
earlier bentsen became the third democrat to support the 
embattled nomination saying i hope that when i get the next 
chance to talk with john tower about the tough job of keeping this 
country strong it will be while hes in his new office at the 
pentagon 
im both honored to have his prestigious support and grateful 
for his humane understanding of what my family has endured tower 
said 
despite bentsens decision mitchell repeated his claim the 
senate will reject the nomination and he led a chorus of democrats 
who called for a quick vote 
mitchell said he was ready to vote as soon as possible a 
reasonable time would be tomorrow 
tower who served in the senate from 1961 to 1984 has been 
dogged by allegations of excessive drinking and womanizing as well 
as questions about his lucrative defense consulting contracts since 
retirement from government service 
bentsens decision to support the nominee was high drama 
the former vice presidential candidate praised the work of fellow 
democrats who have opposed the nomination mitchell and sam nunn 
the georgia senator who chairs the armed services committee but 
said he would support the a man with whom he served in the senate 
for 14 years 
bentsen noted that in january he had introduced tower to the 
senate armed services committee and said he was qualified to be 
defense secretary since then he said he has read the fbi report 
and heard the accusations against tower 
i found most of the allegations about john towers personal 
life without enough basis to deny a president his choice said 
bentsen the influential senate finance committee chairman who had 
been courted by the white house after the nomination ran aground 
bentsen conceded that the nomination process which has been so 
difficult for tower has been equally painful for himself 
in the passion of debate pundits writing in the isolation of 
their own offices can forget that public figures have feelings 
bentsen said we have seen every imperfection in an essentially 
good man dragged into the pitiless glare of television lights while 
his daughters sat listening 
after bentsen made his announcement nunn who has led the fight 
against towers confirmation walked over and shook his hand 
watching the senate proceedings were towers daughters jeanne 
tower cox and marian tower sen alan simpson rwyo ushered the 
two women outside the senate gallery and bentsen greeted each of 
them with a hug

president bush is trying to dispel an 
impression that nothing is happening in his young 
administration saying it hasnt been stalled by his struggle to win 
confirmation of john tower as defense secretary 
bush on tuesday responded to news reports that his administration 
is adrift by recounting actions he has taken such as developing a 
savings and loan rescue plan meeting with foreign leaders and 
presenting a budget package to congress 
my response is its not adrift and there isnt malaise he 
said i would simply resist the clamor that nothing seems to be 
bubbling around that nothing is happening a lot is happening not 
all of it good but a lot is happening 
bush in an impromptu news conference also reiterated his 
opposition to white house intervention in the eastern airlines 
strike he said pilots threatening a slowdown to support the 
striking machinists should not make the innocent traveling public

the justice departments antitrust chief is 
promising tougher enforcement of laws to preserve competition in the 
airlines industry 
assistant attorney general charles f rule said in a speech 
tuesday that the antitrust division would take a harder look at 
mergers than did the transportation department which gave up its 
authority to review airline deals at the end of 1988 
perhaps somewhat overlooked by dot in the course of 
deregulating the airline industry the antitrust laws have a 
valuable role to play to ensure that a competitive environment does 
not sow the seeds of its own demise rule told the international 
aviation club 
the antitrust division intends to use its newfound authority 
as well as preexisting authority to apply those laws with 
appropriate care in order to ensure that us airline markets remain 
competitive in the years to come rule said

home sweet home is a cruel illusion for 
millions of women not just in the united states but also in 
countries around the globe according to an analysis of violence 
against women worldwide 
if a person is murdered because of his or her politics the 
world justifiably responds with outrage but if a person is beaten 
or allowed to die because she is female the world dismisses it as 
cultural tradition says the report from the worldwatch 
institute in washington 
africa and the indian subcontinent are identified as particular 
problem areas by the report which was written by lori heise a 
senior researcher with the institute but no society or 
socioeconomic group has been spared the problem she says 
before the sun goes down today international womens day 
thousands of women worldwide will have been beaten in their homes by 
their partners and thousands more will have been raped assaulted 
and sexually harassed according to heises figures

on a television sitcom the permanent sets 
must be more than a place for the characters to hang out 
any designer can design a standing set said roy christopher 
a fourtime emmywinning production designer 
but to do that and reinforce the vision of the writer and tell 
the audience about the character is absolutely necessary anything 
else is decor 
the cbs show murphy brown required three permanent sets the 
television office and studio where murphy candice bergen and the 
others do fyi the washington bar where they meet after work 
and murphys townhouse in georgetown 
he said the job of the production designer is to design 
everything you see on the screen except people the designer also 
coordinates the wardrobe special effects props and set decoration 
christopher obtained pictures and background material from the 
research library at warner television where the show is made 
i looked at the pictures of television offices but i wanted 
more glamor he said i finally found what i needed in pictures 
of the offices of the newspaper usa today i wanted a hightech 
slickness 
candice bergen called me to say hello she said please dont 
put any orange carpet on the set 
her townhouse seems to be in a permanent state of redecoration 
eldin the painter has become a fixture on the show 
colleen dewhurst liked the show and asked to be on said 
christopher they wrote a part for her as murphys mother she 
said she had only one request we thought oh no here comes the 
request for jack warners old office as her dressing room but what 
she wanted was a scene with eldin the painter 
two christopherdesigned shows are coming up on friday pbs will 
present in the mood the glenn miller band reunion on sunday 
cbs will telecast the peoples choice awards 
i wanted a 1940s big band look for the glenn miller show he 
said its almost art deco black and white i put in two balconies 
over the stage for people to sit that harks back to the days of the 
macambo night club 
in an awards show you go for glamor and short entrances for 
the winners and presenters the first awards show i designed it took 
15 seconds for the entrances with entrances like that a show could 
take 16 hours so you go for short entrances and good backgrounds 
half of my job is glamorizing show business 
christopher has designed five academy award shows five emmy 
shows three grammy shows and four tv academy hall of fame telecasts 
he recently designed the upcoming abc series the robert 
guillaume show and ghost writer a pilot for anthony perkins 
he is currently working on another pilot about a fashion model 
called the high life 
i like to do sets like chico and the man which was an old 
garage or i like to do those that are lush and expensive he said 
when he designed our town it presented a challenge because 
its done on a bare stage 
i painted the whole stage like a grant wood painting he 
said then i suspended scrims to represent roof tops from up high 
it gives the illusion of being a town but when you get down to 
ground level you see its a bare stage 
christopher who lives in a loft in downtown los angeles that he 
and his wife dorothy a set decorator designed works for 
television and the stage but stays away from feature films 
most of them are done on location he said i like to sit 
down and design stuff i like to create an illusion of reality 
feature films just recreate reality

public television viewers can get a look at 
edward james olmos oscarnominated performance in stand and 
deliver this week on pbs american playhouse series 
olmos who won an emmy for best supporting actor playing taciturn 
lt martin castillo on nbcs miami vice is up for an academy 
award this year as best actor for his brilliant performance as 
tough playful reallife mathematics teacher jaime escalante whose 
offbeat style of teaching inspired his disadvantaged east los 
angeles students to go on to higher education 
the film also stars lou diamond phillips la bamba as one of 
the students it airs wednesday on american playhouse on pbs 
olmos has displayed his acting range before in an american 
playhouse film the ballad of gregorio cortez he played the 
title character a quiet lawabiding south texas horseman who has 
to flee an unjust accusation of murder after a fatal 
misunderstanding over a simple spanish word 
in stand and deliver olmos goes in the opposite direction as 
the charismatic escalante who badgerd and cajoled even barrio gang 
members to sign a contract promising to spend 30 hours a week on 
homework stay after school and take extra classes in the summer 
olmos even submitted to treatments to make his hair thin so he 
would resemble the balding escalante 
the bolivianborn escalante gave up a successful career in 
electronics to teach high school he was supposed to teach 
computers but when he arrived at the school there were no 
computers there were however students and escalante began to 
teach them calculus 
the movie centers on the students in escalantes 1982 class 18 
of whom took an advanced placement test in calculus they did 
remarkably well but the testing service became suspicious when 
their wrong answers were too similar and they were accused of 
cheating and disqualified escalante believed the students scores 
would never have been challenged had they not had hispanic surnames 
the film does suggest in one subtle scene that a glitch in 
escalantes teaching methods might have been the reason the students 
all made the same minor mistakes 
phillips plays one of the toughs in escalantes class he is 
smart enough to understand what escalante is offering him a way 
out of poverty but he has to save face with his gang so he asks 
for an extra book see he cant be seen carrying schoolbooks 
around so hell keep one at home and one at school 
some of the other students are played by virginia paris mark 
eliot ingrid oliu karla montana richard martinez and mark everett 
the film was cowritten by ramon menendez borderline and 
tom musca nikita menendez directed 
stand and deliver is an example of a financing arrangement 
through which pbs helps pay production costs in exchange for 
television rights the deal has resulted in some of the most 
talkedabout independent films in recent years including 
testament in 1983 el norte in 1984 smooth talk in 
1985 and last years critically acclaimed documentary the thin 
blue line which recently led to the overturning of a murder 
conviction it will appear on american playhouse next season

that commission hunting for a politically 
blameless way to deal with budget deficits had to give up the search 
but it did leave some advice on better ways for the government to 
make spending decisions 
thats something congress has been seeking since it went into 
business 200 years ago in a way the process almost came full 
circle 
the first congress passed a single appropriations bill and 
entrusted specific spending decisions to the white house after all 
if you couldnt trust george washington 
by the 1980s the appropriations process had become so cumbersome 
and contentious that congress twice despaired of passing individual 
money bills and piled everything into a single mammoth resolution 
full of detailed orders and restrictions 
president reagan signed under protest accepting items he opposed 
in order to get others he wanted and to keep the government going 
hed vetoed one catchall appropriations resolution during his first 
term producing a temporary government shutdown rather than accept 
spending he said would bust his austerity budget 
president bush says he will not accept a single catchall money 
measure i am going to refuse to sign another omnibus spending 
bill he said as a candidate that may be put to the test 
congress managed to pass all its money bills on time during the 
last budget year because of an agreement reached under the pressure 
of the 1987 stock market crash with no crisis to enforce 
discipline that performance will be difficult to match 
while it expired without a bipartisan consensus on deficit 
reduction measures the national economic commission did agree that 
any plan to cut deficits will have to include changes in the way 
government spending decisions are made 
the balance of power on budget issues has swung too far from 
the executive and toward the legislative branch the commissions 
republican majority said 
the panels democrats didnt go quite that far after all these 
days legislative equals democrats and executive equals republicans 
historically though the issue has involved the powers of two 
branches of government rather than competition between the two 
parties 
the commissions 14 members were unanimous on one specific change 
in the system suggesting that the government move to twoyear 
budgets instead of enacting a new one each year 
they also agreed that budget goals should be drawn more clearly 
and enforced more stringently 
the modern budgeting process dates from 1921 when congress began 
requiring presidents to submit detailed annual budgets that put the 
executive branch in charge and congress has been whittling at its 
authority ever since the current congressional budget system was 
installed in the name of reform in 1974 setting a series of 
legislative timetables congress seldom manages to meet 
that law limited the power of presidents to withhold money 
congress appropriates a device that had been used by presidents of 
both parties but one that became most bitterly disputed when 
richard m nixon used it to block increases in more than 100 
domestic programs presidents have been trying to get around that 
barrier ever since 
under the law a president cannot withhold appropriated funds 
unless he advises congress and gets its permission within 45 days 
at the very least bush said in his first budget message when 
a president proposes to rescind federal spending the congress 
should be required to vote on that proposal instead of killing it by 
inaction 
bush also seeks the line item veto authority for a president to 
knock a single spending item out of an appropriations bill without 
rejecting the whole bill that wont happen easily if at all 
because it would undo one of the ways congress can force a president 
to accept what it wants done when an entire appropriation is 
hostage to an unwanted provision presidents often sign rather than 
fight 
reagan had sought the same thing and the economic commission 
majority said presidents should have authority either to veto line 
items or to rescind appropriations once they have become law 
commission republicans advocated a constitutional amendment to 
require a balanced budget and in a bow to bushs nonewtaxes 
pledge said it should include a ceiling on revenues that can be 
collected 
they also recommended what would amount to a permanent system of 
appropriations proposing that congress set up spending resolutions 
that would continue automatically at the previous years dollar 
levels with no increase for inflation 
congress is a lot better at setting deadlines than at meeting 
them so that might be the most significant change of all were it to 
happen it wont

the coffee shop on bleecker street where ed 
oneill had wanted to meet was jampacked with soggy tourists 
seeking refuge from the sudden downpour 
oneill pushed his way through the crowd and suggested a quick 
sprint to his apartment a block away inside the fourthfloor 
walkup oneill checked the refrigerator for vittles and extracted 
white bread mayonnaise and cold turkey which he graciously offered 
his guest no thanks who was busy removing drying sweatsocks from 
the back of the vinyl diningroom chair 
while slathering mayo on bread oneill considered comparisons of 
the show on which he stars foxs married with children and 
abcs new sitcom roseanne both are centered on 
lowermiddleclass families with kids 
oneill plays al bundy a hapless shoe salesman with a primping 
stayathome wife katey sagal and two borderline 
juveniledelinquent kids christina applegate and david faustino 
on roseanne plump protagonists roseanne barr and john 
goodman struggle valiantly if sardonically against the financial 
realities of the bluecollar 80s surrounded by a halo of family 
love 
i like the idea that they roseanne have people who arent 
typically real goodlooking you know televisiontype people 
character people and thats nice i think i think thats part of 
the appeal of it its just kinda like folks said oneill who 
grew up in youngstown ohio the son of a truck driver 
on married with children its a little more work to find 
any evidence of familial love it is suggested to oneill that the 
humor on his show is well kind of mean 
the thing i like about our show is that we are meanspirited a 
lot of times he said we dont even try to hide it or make 
excuses for it 
no kidding a couple of major sponsors recently pulled 
advertising from married with children because of a letter 
campaign by a detroit housewife who said she found the show 
antifamily fox says it has a waiting list for commercial spots 
nevertheless 
in a recent episode the bundys gleefully hied to a fancy 
restaurant to blow the pittance a deceased relative had left them 
when the bill came al realized he had left his wallet at home the 
kids sent to fetch the money were faced with a moral dilemma 
return to bail out the folks or purchase tickets to that nights 
tears and vomit concert the kids split with the cash 
such noholdsbarred slaps at typical sitcom family life have 
found an audience for fox married with children is pulling 
a networkquality share of the sunday audience and has become a 
force to be reckoned with by the big guys at abc cbs and nbc 
oneill a serious new york stage actor who had found some 
success guesting on network shows and starring in a couple of 
pilots heard about the new fox network on a trip to los angeles 
i read it and i was laughing he recalled and i went in 
and read for them executive producers ron leavitt and michael 
moye and they were such funny guys they were such offthewall 
characters i immediately thought i like this i had like 
this connection to the character 
back in new york his agent advised to pass on the sitcom since 
he was hot at nbc having starred in the madefortv movie 
popeye doyle 
so i said ok pass so about 20 minutes later im just 
sitting here thinking i like that so i called la i said all 
right if theyll give me 4000 more a week tell em they have a 
deal and ill be there in the morning 
now oneill has become something of a latterday ralph kramden 
fans who know him as al stop him on the street 
somehow they identify with the guy they relate to him some 
way and i know i did when i read the pilot it just reminded me of 
a couple of my uncles its a selfdeprecating humor people that 
dont have a lot going for them the ones that always interest me 
the most are the ones who can laugh at their situation a lot as sort 
of a way through it and i saw that in the character

the use of aborted fetuses is redefining the ground rules of 
medical research pitting scientists who hope to alleviate suffering 
against ethicists who fear the specter of nazistyle experimentation 
on unwilling subjects 
critics of fetal tissue research envision abortionforprofit 
from tissue sales and foresee organ parts shops in hospitals 
proponents counter that researchers are steering a morally neutral 
course 
can science separate the use of human material from the way it 
was obtained that central ethical question of the nuremburg medical 
trials following world war ii is being raised again over fetal 
tissue research a new frontier of medicine 
the only answer to this obviously is the answer which our 
whole culture is in anguish over are these people fetuses human 
beings said the rev richard john neuhaus a lutheran theologian 
who was among more than 500 signers of an interfaith letter urging 
the federal government to ban funding for research using 
intentionally aborted fetuses 
if we learned anything from the medical trials at nuremberg it 
is that science is not in itself good it can be used for good or 
evil said richard doerflinger associate director of the office 
of prolife activities of the us catholic conference our point 
is the way science is implemented has to respect human dignity 
on the other side there are human concerns too 
for decades a 52yearold patient of dr curt freed has suffered 
from degenerative parkinsons disease but now after implants of 
fetal tissue to the brain the man is improving said freed of the 
university of colorado health sciences center in denver 
the implants may alleviate the sudden loss of function and other 
symptoms that parkinsons sufferers endure they may find 
themselves frozen sitting in church for example freed said it 
would be that kind of phenomenon eliminating freezing episodes 
a special national institutes of health advisory committee 
decided last december it would be acceptable for the federal 
government to back medical research involving the transplant of 
tissue of intentionally aborted fetuses 
and a month later at the annual meeting of the american 
association for the advancement of science stanford university 
president donald kennedy classified righttolife advocates who 
would ban all research with fetal tissues as among the enemies of 
scientific progress 
researchers hope that transplanting fetal cells into people with 
diabetes and parkinsons disease may provide an effective treatment 
and also see the potential such research has for similarly treating 
other serious diseases such as alzheimers 
tissue can be obtained elsewhere including from the patients 
own body but some experts say fetal tissue has the advantages of 
eliminating the need for surgery on the patient to gather the tissue 
and its immaturity may make it more adaptable 
we must separate the issue of abortion from medical research 
said the chairman of the nih advisory committee retired federal 
appeals judge arlin m adams of philadelphia 
the committee recommended guidelines such as prohibiting profits 
from the sale f fetal tissue but the panels majority opinion was 
that the ethics of where the tissue was obtained largely should not 
be considered 
if not used fetal brain cells and other tissues would simply be 
discarded say many researchers who see no reflection of the moral 
abyss of the nazi era 
from my perspective the bottom line is once a woman decides 
shes going to have an abortion i just dont understand why it 
fetal tissue shouldnt be used said dr myron genel a 
professor of pediatrics and an associate dean of the yale school of 
medicine 
i say this as one who had a substantial number of my family 
destroyed in the holocaust 
to others its impossible to distance the act of abortion from 
the use of resulting fetal tissue 
its as separate as me being here and you being there and we 
being held together by only the one bullet which i have just 
fired said the rev james burtchaell a member of the nih panel 
who dissented from its report its an absurd claim 
burtchaell a professor of moral theology at the university of 
notre dame said government sponsorship of fetal tissue research 
would be the most powerful expression of public approval of abortion 
since the supreme courts decision in roe vs wade 
the ambivalence and misgivings that make the abortion decision so 
painful for some women could easily be relieved by the 
rationalization yes this is a tragic thing but some good could 
come out of it burtchaell said 
if the research becomes profitable ethical concerns may be 
forgotten neuhaus added 
health is big bucks superbucks mega bucks there are few 
things americans are willing to pay more for than health for the 
prolongation of life he said the commercial dynamics are 
powerfully on the side of blocking out moral reflection it is not 
in any way farfetched to envision that in not too many years every 
hospital will have a parts shop 
arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at 
the university of minnesota sees a vexing moral problem with 
using aborted fetal tissue and believes research must be closely 
regulated 
fetal tissue should be handled he said through a thirdparty 
system like that used for organ donations 
such donations are regulated to separate the physicians awaiting 
the organ from the patients treatment in order to assure the 
patient as caplan put it im not trying to kill you to get your 
parts 
it also is no longer simply academic speculation that someone 
might create life to destroy it for valuable tissue caplan said 
i know of three people who have been willing to get pregnant to 
donate tissue either to themselves or a family member 
rabbi james rudin of the american jewish committe who serves on 
the new york state task force on life and the law finds compelling 
arguments on both sides 
rudin said he has no objection to the use of fetal tissue for 
medical research but he is worried that the practice may encourage 
abortions and eventually may lead to poor women selling fetal tissue 
i was raised where science was going to answer all our 
problems rudin said 
but science per se is neutral rudin said our moral and public 
policy guidelines are just now catching up with what were capable 
of doing

for mutual fund investors who dont keep careful 
records tax time can bring some bigleague headaches 
like anybody else fund investors can turn the labors of filling 
out the forms over to a hired expert familiar with all the twists 
and turns of the tax code 
but even an accounting wizard cant do much for them if they 
dont have the proper records of all their activity 
suppose you cashed in half of a 10000 holding of fund shares in 
1988 to treat yourself to a hardearned vacation how much of that 
5000 is subject to tax 
it depends on your cost basis for those shares which can be 
computed in several different ways 
the cost basis includes not only the cash you used to buy into 
the fund but any dividends and capital gains distributions that were 
subsequently reinvested in additional shares 
investors sometimes sell fund shares without realizing that 
reinvested dividends have raised their total cost basis observes 
standard amp poors corp in its weekly advisory publication the 
outlook so they pay taxes on the income a second time 
lets assume for the sake of illustration that you began 
investing in hypothetical fund several years ago with 5000 over 
the five subsequent years the fund paid dividends and capital gains 
distributions totaling 2500 
even though you had the payouts automatically reinvested in 
additional shares you were obliged to report them as taxable income 
in the year they were made 
then suppose that last year at a point when your investment was 
worth 10000 you wearied of the ups and downs of the stock and 
bond markets and switched it into a money fund 
such switches are considered tantamount to selling one investment 
and buying another creating what accountants call a taxable 
event 
if you thought of your cost as only your original cash outlay 
that left you with a capital gain of 5000 
but if you had kept a file of statements from the fund over the 
years you would be able to determine and to substantiate that 
your cost basis was actually 7500 thus cutting your taxable gain 
in half 
in the real world of course even modest mutual fund accounts 
are rarely as simple as that example with its convenient round 
numbers many fund investors make multiple purchases over time in 
their efforts to accumulate a nest egg 
all that however only makes good recordkeeping more important 
the right records are essential if you want to take advantage of a 
system called the actual cost method of determining your tax 
liability when you sell 
lets say you made purchases of a fund at times when its net 
asset value stood at 10 and 14 and now you want to redeem some of 
your shares with the net asset value back down at 12 
if you can identify the shares in your redemption letter as those 
you bought for 14 and get confirmation from the fund that it 
followed your instructions specifically that allows you to claim a 
capital loss that may be deductible on your tax return 
the key to this method is detailed and accurate record 
keeping says donoghues moneyletter an advisory publication on 
matters of personal finance 
you have to accurately document what you buy or sell when and 
for how much but your effort is well worth it

in most cases says a federal review the 
people hired by the agriculture department to be the eyes and ears 
of american farmers in foreign countries cant talk turkey unless 
the conversation is in english 
the general accounting office the investigative agency of 
congress found the language gap in the foreign agricultural 
service which has maintained an overseas network of agricultural 
attaches for more than 30 years to help promote us farm 
commodities 
during the 1988 fiscal year which ended last sept 30 the 
service primarily at us embassies operated 65 posts and 14 
agricultural trade offices overseas with 103 attaches responsible 
for representing us farm interests in more than 100 countries 
the agency also employs about 160 foreign nationals to help 
attaches in those offices last years budget for those foreign 
operations was 248 million 
rep e kika de la garza dtexas chairman of the house 
agriculture committee asked for a review of the attache system the 
gao report was submitted to him last month 
historically the report said the criticism of the usda agency 
has focused on requirements that the attaches make too many reports 
that take time away from market development functions recent 
changes have helped ease that situation but further improvements 
should be made 
one of the most glaring deficiencies in the foreign agricultural 
service involves language skills the gao said which are necessary 
to effectively communicate in host countries 
the service has not formally set minimum proficiency levels for 
the principal language of the country to which the attache is 
assigned the report said the service believes that a 
speakingreading proficiency level of 3 based on a 0 to 5 scale is 
sufficient to perform the general business activities of attaches 
but that a higher proficiency level is required to conduct sensitive 
or technical negotiations 
among 93 attaches assigned as of september 1987 to countries with 
nonenglish languages only 24 26 percent had at least the level 
3 proficiency the report said 
by comparison a list of 1021 state department employees 
assigned to foreign service jobs showed that 676 or 66 percent 
showed at least a level 3 language proficiency 
the fas told investigators that some of the attaches which 
included trade officers and higherranked agricultural counselors 
for purposes of the review had not yet completed five years of 
foreign service the minimum time allowed for achieving language 
proficiency 
others had been commissioned as attaches in languages different 
from that required in posts at the time of the review and sometimes 
under different standards prior to current requirements 
also the agency said foreign service nationals or fsns 
can readily provide translations needed to gather and read 
information in a foreign language in the overseas posts 
the gao report concluded that attaches generally appear to 
possess acceptable levels of education and experience when they 
are accepted as overseas candidates but that the majority of 
attaches seem to fall short in their ability to communicate 
effectively in the principal foreign language practiced in their 
host countries 
thomas o kay administrator of the foreign agricultural service 
said in a letter responding to the gao report that the agency 
fully concurs that language efficiency should be improved 
and we are already doing more he said we have designated 
five languages japanese chinese korean arabic and russian as 
hard languages and we are now providing a years language 
training 
kay said the agencys policy is to rotate overseas staff back to 
washington more frequently before going out to another job and that 
this will also help assure that they get more adequate language 
training 
but kay said that due to personnel and monetary restraints 
the agency cannot provide extensive training in seldomused 
languages that attaches would be only expected to serve once in 
their careers or in posts where english is widely used 
kay included a list of us posts in countries where a foreign 
language is not required those are united kingdom australia new 
zealand canada india pakistan kenya egypt nigeria south 
africa singapore hong kong and the philippines 
in addition the agency operates in five overseas posts where 
english will suffice for attaches sweden netherlands denmark 
rome and geneva

in theory the supreme court is insulated from politics but that 
isnt stopping the opposing sides on the abortion issue from 
mounting intense lobbying campaigns as the justices prepare to hear 
a controversial missouri case that could end the countrys current 
era of legal abortions 
the supreme court is expected to hear the appeal webs which favors 
abortion on demand 
our people want the supreme court and president bush whos 
pushing the court on this issue to know just how they feel she 
said we are cosponsoring what promises to be a massive march in 
washington on april 9th and i wont be surprised if a quarter of a 
million demonstrators show up our people are furious 
odell who is coordinating nows role in the march said she 
thinks a big turnout wont go unnoticed at the court 
whatever the decision is she said it will be couched in 
legal terms but in fact it is a political question that like 
prohibition ultimately will be decided by public opinion 
judie brown president of the american life league which opposes 
legalized abortions said she too thinks political considerations 
will weigh heavily in the supreme courts decision 
public opinion means everything to the court said brown who 
says her organization includes 200000 families around the country 
we feel all forms of expression will impact on the court 
the american life leagues most expensive form of expression will 
be a series of fullpage advertisements in usa today the washington 
post and the washington times the ads will run during the week 
before the oppositions april march and will cost 150000 
they will include justreleased information weve taken from 
the file of the late justice william o douglas during the debate on 
roe vs wade she said its clear from these files that a small 
but very vocal minority was able to influence the decision which 
made abortion legal in this country 
in roe vs wade the court held that while a womans right to 
privacy gives her the right to have an abortion the state may 
regulate or prohibit abortions once the fetus is viable 
since the 1973 decision there have been relatively few 
thirdtrimester abortions even though that same court in doe vs 
bolton said the mothers life or health should be an overriding 
factor in the decision of whether to permit an abortion even after 
the fetus is viable 
in case to be in april the missouri legislature passed a 1986 
statute banning abortions at public hospitals or any other public 
facilities unless the womans life is in danger the act whose 
preamble states that viability begins at conception also forbids 
public funds from being used for abortions or for abortion 
counseling except when the mothers life is threatened 
the statute was challenged immediately by two abortion clinics 
reproductive health services of st louis and planned parenthood in 
kansas city 
in march 1987 a federal district judge in kansas city declared 
the major sections of the statute to be unconstitutional 
infringements of roe vs wade in july 1987 the 8th us circuit 
court of appeals upheld the bulk of the lower courts decision 
last year william webster missouris attorney general asked 
the supreme court to review the case he also asked the court if it 
should side with the appeals courts to then consider whether roe 
vs wade itself is constitutional 
the supreme court announced in january it would consider the 
case setting off a flurry of planning and activity on both sides of 
the issue 
weve already raised most of the 150000 for our upcoming 
newspaper ads brown said adding that 150000 is an 
exceptionally large expenditure for the american life league 
the national abortion rights action league already has spent more 
than 500000 on newspaper advertising the fullpage ads which 
feature a coat hanger a reminder of the days of backalley 
abortions first ran on jan 22 
were running them in some of the major newspapers across the 
country said kate michelman narals executive director were 
also doing radio and tv ads and making ourselves available to the 
media for interviews and talk shows and the like 
so far she said there has been a tremendous response to the 
ads which ask for pledges of support 
weve had more than 30000 responses to the january ads she 
said the ads cost 300000 and we took in 350000 
michelman said while naral sees a drawnout fight over the 
abortion issue she feels the supreme court can be influenced 
theres no doubt were in trouble given the changes in the 
court since roe vs wade she said but the supreme court 
doesnt act in a vacuum it is sensitive to the political and social 
climate of the country 
because of this said david andrews acting president of the 
planned parenthood federation of america his group is trying to 
mobilize mainstream americans 
theres no question this is a political issue and while the 
supreme court cant be lobbied directly it can influenced by a 
great outpouring of voices he said 
barbara macgear of operation rescue a binghamton nybased 
prolife group which has helped stage protests at abortion clinics 
around the country said we plan keeping with our agenda of 
demonstrations and civil disobedience 
frankly she added i dont know whether the supreme court 
can be swayed by what happens in the streets but were watching 
closely what were really hoping for though is a righttolife 
amendment to the us constitution 
douglas johnson legal director of the national righttolife 
committee acknowledged that the courts acceptance of the missouri 
case and the resulting news media focus have provided an unusual 
forum 
he said he has been kind of amused by some of the efforts to 
get the supreme courts attention 
in our view he said these efforts are unlikely to 
influence the case our legal brief certainly isnt going to talk 
about the harris poll it talks about the constitution 
then he added but roe vs wade was a political decision an 
act of judicial lawmaking

editors note business writer marcy gordon covering the eastern 
airlines strike in miami flew to new york on tuesday the first day 
of a pilot job action to strictly follow safety procedures 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
for patrons of the heavily traveled atlantic 
coast air routes a bythebook pilot job action to support eastern 
airlines strikers had little effect but that didnt stop people 
from talking and griping about it 
the travails of the airline industry seemed to be on many 
passenger minds tuesday the first day of the job action by the air 
line pilots association in response to what the union called safety 
concerns raised by the eastern strike 
if a miamiatlantawashingtonnew york itinerary was any 
indication there were delays of up to an hour for reasons that 
ranged from bad weather to luggageloading runway deicing and 
overbooking that could be any typical flying day during the winter 
on one of the nations most congested air routes 
but when a nearly full delta air lines flight from miami to 
atlanta was waylaid for what the cockpit crew called a cargo delay 
many passengers immediately suspected the pilots were behind it and 
werent pleased 
i think its in poor taste nobody wins said melton 
johnston a merchant marine captain en route to bermuda another 
passenger franco lizenzi a miami engineer said i think theyre 
doing it more out of sympathy 
at a layover in atlantas sprawling hartsfield international 
airport eastern counters were eerily empty their erstwhile patrons 
swarming to alternate flights on delta the regions dominant 
airline 
eastern pickets walked peacefully saying they werent surprised 
at their employers decision to ground most flights in response to 
the refusal by pilots and flight attendants to honor a strike by the 
machinists union 
finally the company was truthful with the american flying 
public said vince garland a 10year eastern pilot he said the 
pilot slowdown demonstrated that alpa is united in our support of 
the machinists position 
later on a fully booked atlantawashington delta flight the 
plane was delayed half an hour at the terminal because of what 
agents called a delay at washingtons national airport for runway 
deicing 
shortly before the plane began its descent the cockpit crew 
informed passengers the plane would have to circle because of an 
unspecified air traffic problem at national 
we really cant adequately explain the delay the flight 
captain said that riled some business passengers already miffed 
about the earlier stall 
the pilots are antagonizing the public said a company 
executive who spoke with a reporter but didnt want to be quoted by 
name theyre making me upset right now and thats stupid

drexel burnham lambert inc opposed part of the 
wall street firms landmark securities fraud settlement but went 
along with it out of fear the government would bring more serious 
charges drexels chief executive is quoted as saying in court 
papers 
drexel agreed to dismiss bond trader michael milken and withhold 
his pay depite the companys disagreement with the terms chief 
executive frederick h joseph said in a separate filing tuesday 
it was the first time drexel publicly asserted that the firm 
opposed parts of the 650 million criminal plea agreement reached in 
december 
lawyers for milken said joseph told employees that drexel settled 
because the government planned to bring charges under the federal 
racketeer influenced and corruption organizations act that could 
have frozen billions of dollars of the firms assets 
the documents were filed in manhattan federal court as part of a 
challenge by milken and his brother lowell also a drexel 
executive to provisions of the criminal settlement that capped a 
twoyear investigation of securities law violations 
they were going to indict us under rico and there would 
be a multihundredmilliondollar forefeiture joseph said jan 6 
in a telephone hookup with employees papers filed by the milkens 
stated 
we ultimately concluded the bottom line was the firm absolutely 
had to settle that a financial institution cannot stand up to a 
rico indictment he stated according to the court papers 
the plea agreement forces drexel to dismiss michael milken and 
withhold his more than 100 million in 1988 pay and keep at least 
half of lowell milkens pay and fire him if he is indicted 
joseph said in an accompanying affidavit that the milken 
provisions were initiated by the government and inserted in the 
plea agreement at the governments request 
he said drexel opposed the action but took them in order to 
reach an overall agreement with the government he said drexel 
would be willing to pay the milkens if not for the pact 
assistant us attorney john carroll said the government would 
have no comment on the filings a hearing on the milkens motion is 
set for march 14 
one week ago joseph filed a supporting affidavit for the 
government in the same case admitting that drexel entered into 
the plea agreement voluntarily and without coercion after consulting 
with counsel 
the government has said the possibility of indictment on more 
serious charges does not constitute coercion and that drexel was not 
threatened with rico charges during negotiations

or modify the settlement under which drexel has agreed to pay 650 
million in fines and restitution and plead guilty to six felonies

a favorable ruling by the london stock exchange 
won praise from high voltage engineering corp but was dismissed as 
an interesting sidelight by the companys takeover target 
universal foods corp 
the london exchange decided tuesday that berisford international 
plc a british food company financing high voltages 643 million 
35ashare bid for milwaukeebased universal foods does not have 
to ask its shareholders to approve its role in the takeover 
were very excited said clifford press deputy chairman of 
high voltage 
press said that in light of the decision high voltage and 
berisford are considering changing a provision under which a change 
of ownership of high voltage or berisford would allow the other to 
purchase the stake in universal foods 
press said the attempt to bring berisford into the takeover 
action has been a complete sideshow a desperate effort by 
universal foods to avoid dealing with us were pleased its been 
put to bed 
but paula norton a universal foods spokeswoman discounted the 
impact of the berisford decision 
berisfords problem with its shareholders is an interesting 
sidelight she said but its just that its peripheral to the 
issues being decided by judge joseph stadtmueller 
she was referring to high voltages effort to get universal 
foods antitakeover defenses overturned in us district court in 
milwaukee 
high voltage launched the takeover attempt for universal foods in 
december the burlington massbased company is owned jointly by 
berisford and two new york investors 
universal foods seeking to have the high voltage takeover 
attempt halted has argued that berisford failed to reveal its exact 
role in the takeover bid in violation of the requirements of the 
us securities and exchange commission 
universal foods stock closed tuesday at 3475 a share up 150 
on volume of 514800 shares 
berisford also said tuesday that it hopes to renegotiate its 
partnership with hyde park holdings of massachusetts berisford and 
hyde park own equal stakes in high voltage 
the decision to seek changes in the partnership accord was 
berisfords first public response to complaints from associated 
british foods plc which owns a 24 percent stake in berisford 
associated british foods argues that the partnership accord may 
constitute a socalled poison pill that would discourage any company 
considering a takeover of berisford 
associated british foods also has sought to have berisford submit 
details of its role in the universal foods bid for shareholder 
approval

wall street analysts have dismissed rumors that 
time inc might receive a takeover bid more lucrative than the media 
giants planned 18 billion merger with warner communications inc 
but investors were captivated by the idea of a possible outside 
offer and bid time stock up 925 a share tuesday to 11675 in 
heavy new york stock exchange trading warner meanwhile rose 62 
cents to close at 4887 
time has been the target of persistent takeover rumors but the 
analysts rejected the latest talk and predicted the companys plans 
to merge with warner through an exchange of stock would go through 
it would be puzzling that anyone would necessarily make a bid 
now because of the discount value time has traded at for years 
said mary kukowski an analyst with bear stearns amp co theres 
been a window of opportunity and no one did it before so why do it 
now 
jay nelson an analyst with brown brothers harriman inc said 
the odds are better than 5050 against a bid partly because of 
the antitakeover atmosphere in washington after the late 1988 wave 
of multibilliondollar leveraged buyouts 
members of congress and the bush administration have suggested 
steps be taken to curb takeovers following the record 2453 billion 
buyout of rjr nabisco inc by kohlberg kravis roberts amp co 
big buyouts financed through heavy borrowing such as the rjr 
nabisco deal are seen as unamerican nelson said while time and 
warner are positioning the deal as proamerica and probusiness 
if i read congress correctly they would prefer to see someone 
run the business and not break it up and lay off employees nelson 
said time and warner say no jobs will be lost as a result of their 
merger and that the combined company will be better able to compete 
with other international media giants 
although investors focused tuesday on time they continued buying 
stock in other media companies whose stock prices rose sharply 
monday in industrywide takeover speculation 
gulf amp western corp owner of paramount pictures corp rose 
125 to 4712 a share tuesday while mca inc rose 125 to close 
at 5425 
cbs inc which soared 6 on monday finished down 212 at 170 
on tuesday 
other questions about the timewarner merger lingered such as 
the possible opposition of chriscraft industries inc warners 
largest shareholder 
when the warner board voted 120 with one abstention to approve 
the merger chriscraft chairman herbert j siegel was the 
abstaining director according to a warner source who spoke on 
condition of anonymity 
siegel who has bickered with warner chairman steven ross for 
years has kept an uncharacteristically low profile since the 
timewarner deal was announced he did not return a reporters 
telephone calls seeking comment on the merger 
chriscraft acquired its stake when it helped warner fight an 
unwanted takeover by media giant rupert murdoch in 1984 but siegel 
tried to stop warners recent acquisition of lorimar telepictures 
corp in the past he and ross argued about the makeup of the warner 
board and the size of ross salary 
but analysts noting that siegels power will be diluted in the 
merger said he wont be able to stop the deal 
warner officials say siegels stake in the new company will 
decline to 6 percent to 7 percent from his current 11 percent warner 
share while the amount of shareholder votes he controls will drop 
to 142 percent from the 17 percent he controls at warner 
chriscraft stock closed down 12 cents a share at 3337 
following a 375ashare rise on monday

the proposed merger of the media giant time inc 
and entertainment producer warner communications inc could lead to 
fewer programming choices on their huge cable system operations 
critics say 
both companies own cable systems that are among the five largest 
in the nation the combination would rank second behind the biggest 
cable operator telecommunications inc 
the proposed timewarner combination could diminish the free 
flow of information said andrew schwartzman executive director 
of media access project which describes itself as a public interest 
law firm 
he said tuesday that the combined cable operations may turn to 
the programming produced by sister businesses at warner which has 
major movie and television production operations rather than buy 
it from independent producers 
it will affect the prices paid for programming and the variety 
and diversity of programming that is available and impair the 
ability of other companies to come in and compete effectively 
schwartzman said 
tom rogers president of nbc cable the general electric co 
division that is preparing to launch a new cable network consumer 
news and business channel said the merger could make it tougher to 
get a big audience for cnbc 
rogers said cable systems with 125 million subscribers already 
have signed up for cnbc ahead of earlier projections for the 
services launch 
but he said time has refused to put the service on its cable 
systems adding that could be because time has the right to take 
over another cable service cable news network if cnns owner 
turner broadcasting corp is sold 
if warner is merged into time that is 55 million subscribers 
that are outside cnbc distribution he said 
michael luftman a spokesman for times american television and 
communications corp said it was premature to speculate how the 
combination would affect programming choices 
but he said that once the merger is completed the cable systems 
will be run fairly autonomously even though one person will oversee 
both of them 
paula greer an analyst for the media research firm paul kagan amp 
associates of carmel calif said the combined cable operation 
probably would be able to command a cheaper rate for programming 
than the systems paid as separate entities she said there also may 
be economies of scale in combining some of their administrative 
operations 
she said the combination extends a trend toward consolidation in 
the cable business which has raised concerns that the operators 
who have been freed from federal rate regulation will boost their 
prices 
those fears were not borne out last year the first year of full 
rate deregulation when the average basic cable rate rose about 10 
percent down from a 197 percent rise the previous year she said 
time owns 82 percent of american television based in stamford 
conn it is the secondbiggest cable system operator with about 4 
million basic subscribers 
warner cable communications based in new york has about 15 
million basic subscribers and ranks fifth among operators 
but a combined time warner cable company still would trail 
denverbased tci which has about 97 million subscribers that 
figure includes its share of subscribers to systems in which it has 
a part interest kagan said 
officials of time and warner told securities analysts earlier 
this week that they anticipated no serious antitrust problems with 
their merger which was announced saturday the merger requires 
stockholder approval 
they said time warner may have to sell american televisions 
cable system in southern california which has 30000 subscribers 
because of warners minority interest in bhc inc which owns 
television station kcop in los angeles 
the government prohibits companies from operating a television 
station and a cable system in the same market

fortytwo ford motor co employees got a 
little extra along with their profitsharing checks a brief chat 
with the companys vice chairman 
harold poling dropped by fords sprawling rouge complex on 
tuesday to hand out profitsharing checks of about 2800 apiece to 
workers at the dearborn assembly and stamping plants 
poling chatted briefly with betsy cole a ford employee for 16 
years whos been at the dearborn assembly plant for 13 of them 
i told him i was going to put it down on a new car she said 
after talking with poling she said she hasnt decided which car she 
would buy but it definitely would be a ford 
a little further down the line joe hines got his check and told 
poling it would go for his daughters college tuition hines 62 
has been a ford employee for 35 years 
and before heading to the line poling gave a check to fred 
mcnulty of garden city whos been working at fords dearborn 
assembly plant for 25 years 
i already put it in a money market account he said ive 
always have put it in a money market 
poling said that if a ford employee had been around to collect 
all six profitsharing checks the automaker has issued the worker 
would have received about 12200 
despite my reputation as a costcutter im a strong believer 
in profit sharing count on it he said before his stroll by an 
assembly line on which new mustangs rolled past 
more than 152000 workers received their checks tuesday the 
amount was the secondhighest in auto industry history and far 
outpaced those of general motors corp and chrysler corp which 
will distribute their profitsharing checks later this month 
gm has said its typical worker will receive 254 while 
chryslers average check will be about 720 
profitsharing among each of the nations big three automakers is 
based on financial performance in their north american operations 
profit for those activities must reach certain levels for 
profitsharing to kick in 
ford and gm began distributing profitsharing checks in early 
1984 and ford has continued every year since 
gm which will mail this years checks march 14 to about 450000 
hourly and salaried workers had no profitsharing payments in 1987 
or 1988 
chrysler will distribute its profitsharing checks friday to more 
than 82000 hourly and salaried workers the no 3 automaker didnt 
begin profitsharing payments until this year but handed out 500 
checks to employees in each of the past two years in lieu of profit 
sharing 
last year ford provided about 3700 per employee in 
profitsharing the largest in the fiveyear history of the payments 
by automakers the lowest amount ford workers have received was 
about 400 each in 1984 
while some ford employees celebrated this years profitsharing 
checks with dinners or longplanned purchases others never will see 
the money 
last year in an agreement between ford and the wayne county 
friend of the court the company withheld profitsharing checks for 
more than 2300 employees who were behind more than 500 in 
childsupport payments 
for the most part though tuesday was a happy day at ford 
factories 
it makes the whole year worth it said reginald white a 
quality upgrader at the dearborn assembly plant

a federal judge on the bench less than three 
months has until friday midnight to decide two questions that could 
determine the outcome of the machinists strike again eastern 
one question does the machinists right to picket railroads 
including amtrak and metronorth mean the railroads own employees 
have a right to observe those picket lines even if their bosses 
order them to work 
the other whats the difference between trains and planes 
specifically does the fact that this case involves two industries 
distinguish it from a 1987 supreme court decision involving two 
railroads 
the man on the spot is us district court judge robert p 
patterson jr he was elevated to the bench dec 20 
hes ruling in an arcane area of labor law hes under rea time 
pressure and hes going to have to make new law says a 
management labor lawyer speaking on the condition of anonymity 
this case is out at the edge of where the law is 
this is arcane stuff even for labor lawyers and veteran 
judges said another lawyer who spoke on the same terms this 
judge has got some learning to do 
in an apparent attempt to force federal intervention the 
machinists last week announced plans to picket railroad stations as 
part of their strike against eastern 
but on sunday patterson who was spending the weekend upstate 
at his country home fair oaks farm issued an order that barred 
railroad union members from striking until 3 pm wednesday and set 
a hearing an hour earlier on tuesday he extended his order until 
midnight friday 
the key decision to which patterson will be referring is 
burlington northern railroad vs maintenance of way employees in 
which the supreme court ruled that the railway labor act of 1926 
which covers railroads and airlines does not prohibit secondary 
strikes such strikes are prohibited in most industries by the 
tafthartley act 
the railroads concede the machinists right to picket rail 
stations but argue that the railroads have the right to order their 
employees to cross those picket lines 
the railroads contracts with their unions dont contain explicit 
nostrike clauses which would override the unions right to honor a 
secondary strike but robert bergen a lawyer for metronorth says 
his commuter railroads labor contracts contain an implicit 
nostrike pledge because they stipulate that all disputes be 
subject to arbitration 
jay roth of burbank calif a cochairman of the american bar 
associations railway and airline law committee disputed that he 
said that unless a labor contract specifically bars a secondary 
strike it is a protected act under federal law you either 
have the right or you dont said roth who represents unions 
im at a loss to explain the judges decision to grant the 
restraining order 
the importance of the second question are airlines and 
railroads separate industries stems from the fact that years ago 
the fledgling airline unions got themselves covered by the railway 
labor act it subjects railroad workers to a separate body of labor 
law from other workers 
in the burlington northern case the court held that the railway 
act by not mentioning secondary strikes or boycotts implicitly 
permitted them but that case involved several freight lines does 
the fact that this one involves an airline and several railroads 
significantly distinguish it 
the crossindustry issue may be important for another reason 
with some exceptions including those outlined in the tafthartley 
act federal courts lack jurisdiction to issue injunctions in labor 
disputes but the law that established that principle the norrisla 
guardia act established an exception of its own crossindustry 
secondary strikes 
that legislation reflected congresss conviction that strikes 
should be economic battles not political ones and thus fought only 
by unions and companies in the same industry whether this applies 
to eastern amtrak metronorth and company is for patterson to say

the energy department says growing soviet sales 
of nuclear fuel to us electric utilities are costing the federal 
government hundreds of millions of dollars in lost business 
energy secretary james d watkins told congress the soviets are 
grabbing customers by offering lower prices and that erosion of the 
energy departments nuclear fuel program by foreign competition 
posed a threat to national security 
with excess capacity and a need for hard currency the soviet 
union has been receptive to opportunities to sell enriched uranium 
to us utilities both directly and indirectly through brokers 
watkins said in a written response to a variety of questions from 
the senate energy and natural resources committee 
a text of watkins responses was made available tuesday at the 
committees offices 
as recently as 1974 the united states was the only supplier of 
enriched uranium to nuclear power plants throughout the 
noncommunist world last year the us share of the world market 
had plummeted to about 45 percent watkins said 
the energy department runs the countrys uranium enrichment 
operations at plants in portsmouth ohio and paducah ky these 
plants increase or enrich uranium235 atoms beyond their 
natural concentration for use in nuclear reactors 
watkins said the us uranium enrichment operations lost more 
than 170 million in sales over the past three years to the soviets 
who have made about 30 percent of their enrichment capacity 
available for foreign sales 
the united states stands to lose another 17 billion to foreign 
competition over the next nine years he said 
based on proprietary and government confidential commercial 
information the department is concerned that sales of soviet 
enrichment services to us utilitie do in fact pose a very real 
threat to does market share watkins wrote 
he said the soviets had succeeded in grabbing new foreign sales 
of its enrichment services by offering prices as much as 50 percent 
below the us price he said about half the soviet sales are made 
to us utilities through brokerage firms 
watkins provided no further details about specific soviet 
transactions with us utilities 
watkins said the bush administration was preparing a legislative 
proposal to create a government corporation that would take over the 
energy departments uranium enrichment operations in order to 
restore their competitiveness 
the department does not have the flexibility or discretion to 
compete effectively in the tight world market which has developed 
watkins said adding that maintaining a healthy uranium enrichment 
business has important energy security and national security 
implications 
the plants also supply enriched uranium for the governments 
defense nuclear reactors 
a 1985 congressional budget office study attributed the loss of 
us dominance in nuclear fuel sales to concern in foreign countries 
about the reliability of us supplies many nations also objected 
to restrictions on nuclear fuel use that were enforced through us 
enrichment contracts the study said 
rep marilyn lloyd dtenn introduced a bill last month that 
would prohibit us utilities from directly or indirectly purchasing 
soviet enrichment services she expressed concern that the united 
states could become too dependent on the soviets for nuclear fuel 
posing a potential threat to national security 
watkins also said the bush administration is committed to 
completing a program designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of a 
new technology for enriching uranium the technology called the 
advanced vapor laser isotope separation process would allow the 
united states to compete with the lower soviet prices 
watkins said the department needed 500 million between 1989 and 
1991 to complete the demonstration program he said the process 
could be put into operation by 1996 the administration has 
requested 148 million for it for the coming budget year

congressional democrats are moving to force 
president bush to intervene in the eastern airlines strike but 
spokesmen for the company say it may not survive long enough for the 
bill to pass 
a subcommittee voted 2112 tuesday to advance the bill directing 
bush to call a presidential emergency panel to mediate the strike 
now in its fifth day 
but clark h onstad senior vice president of easterns parent 
company texas air corp told the panel that easterns survival is 
open to question if pilots continue to honor striking 
machinists picket lines 
the strike has stopped all but a few eastern flights and caused 
the company to nearly shut down laying off all but 1500 of its 
nearly 11000 nonunion employees 
the battle pits bush against democrats and organized labor which 
sent its top official aflcio president lane kirkland to testify 
tuesday in support of the bill to force the president to call an 
emergency panel to mediate creation of the panel would end the 
strike for up to 60 days 
kirkland suggested that bushs failure to act gets him off to a 
bad start with labor but transportation secretary samuel skinner 
said he would recommend a veto if the measure passes 
the public works aviation subcommittee voted to send the bill to 
the full committee which is expected to take it up on thursday 
house action is expected by the middle of next week the bill 
also would have to pass the senate if the president vetoes it a 
twothirds vote of both houses would be required to override 
rep newt gingrich of georgia ranking republican on the 
subcommittee said after the subcommittee vote that the eastern 
strike is the wrong issue for organized labor 
he said the bill would have a rough ride in the senate where 
rules allow any opponent to tie it up even if it passes both 
houses he said there are not enough votes to reject a veto 
organized labor is almost certainly in a power struggle it will 
lose to the president said gingrich 
all 19 voting democrats on the subcommittee along with 
republican reps sherwood boehlert and guy molinari both of new 
york supported the bill which directs bush to call an emergency 
panel on tuesday bush reiterated his determination to let the 
machinists union and eastern settle the dispute without federal 
action 
although the railway labor act gives a panel 30 days to mediate 
and imposes an additional 30day coolingoff period subcommittee 
chairman rep james oberstar dminn indicated he might support a 
shorter period for mediating the dispute 
oberstar said even if bush vetoes the measure it would send the 
message that congress wants the strike settled 
the bill as passed by the committee also calls on the panel to 
mediate easterns negotiations with its pilots and flight attendants 
even though contract negotiations for them have not reached the same 
impasse as the machinists dispute 
we want to stick it all into the same bag settle it all at 
once said oberstar 
in miami an eastern attorney told a federal judge the airline 
could not operate more than 48 to 72 hours without pilots but the 
judge refused to compel pilots to return to work 
onstad told the congressional panel that if the airline had to 
pay the wages it was paying before the strike that too could 
quickly kill eastern 
i dont think eastern has the cash to survive two weeks of a 
presidential emergency board he said 
since the airline began bargaining with the international 
association of machinists and aerospace workers he said it has 
reduced its demand for 200 million in wage reductions to 125 
million the union wants 50 million in raises 
onstad declined to say how much eastern was losing as a result of 
the strike but he said losses totaled 1 million a day before feb 1 
and had increased since then 
he said however the airline could still continue operations if 
its pilots would return to work and agree to a plan that would 
increase their productivity by 64 million without cutting wages 
he said the company could pick up between 190 million and 375 
million in revenue from gradual recovery of the business it was 
losing and from planned programs to attract new passengers that he 
said would be enough to avoid bankruptcy

pan am marshaled its ammunition as the eastern 
airlines strike loomed more planes more free coffee crates of 
laminated luggage tags stacks of frequentflier signup forms 
and when the machinist union walked the shuttle war was on 
this just gives us a golden opportunity to get those eastern 
diehard passengers perette ross a pan am marketing director 
said tuesday hopefully theyll become loyalists to the pan am 
shuttle 
when pan am was struck in 1985 we did the same thing going for 
their routes shrugged easterns joe scott its a dogeatdog 
world 
but the dogs were fighting over a particularly big bone this 
week the immensely profitable bostonnew yorkwashington shuttle 
business in which eastern and pan am are the only competitors 
eastern after meeting just half its shuttle schedule saturday 
and sunday and 60 percent monday struggled to restore its presence 
tuesday throwing its strikediminished work force into the effort 
fly us with no reservations eastern declared in fullpage 
newspaper advertisements seeking to reassure timepressed business 
travelers the text pledged our no 1 priority is to keep the 
shuttle flying 
but ridership was low at eastern which has operated the shuttle 
for 27 years and made about 30 million on the service last year 
most of tuesdays flights carried only 15 to 20 passengers 
according to a company source who spoke on condition of anonymity 
pan am moving aggressively reported as much as double its 
normal shuttle business the pan am shuttle has grown since its 
inception in 1986 to about 5000 passengers each weekday or nearly 
half the market 
since easterns strike began saturday pan am has doubled its 
rush hour service put on a bigger airplane to boston and 
aggressively promoted its frequentflier program to shuttle 
passengers it has gone so far as to laminate travelers business 
cards into free luggage tags at its terminals 
airline analysts gave the effort its due pan am has an open 
shot at this market right now said louis marckesano a vice 
president of janney montgomery scott inc a philadelphia brokerage 
house 
the hardest thing in any marketing business is to get somebody 
to try your product marckesano said if pan am indeed is able 
to provide a good product theres a good chance theyll be able to 
keep at least some of the additional traffic theyve taken from 
eastern 
the problem may not be easterns for long it is selling its 
shuttle for 365 million to developer donald trump bruce nobles 
president of the trump shuttle said he was not the least bit 
worried about losses to pan am 
were not just taking over the eastern shuttle we are starting 
a new airline said nobles so the condition of the eastern 
shuttle at the time we close is really not material 
trumps agreement with eastern could be canceled in a case of 
material adverse change to the property nobles said but no 
revenue level or market share was set he said adding we are 
going to close this deal 
still some analysts suggested that the strike if it led to 
bankruptcy for eastern could endanger the sale and others simply 
said trump will be buying a tarnished property 
its just that instead of starting out as number 1 said 
marckesano he may start as number 2

authorities today arrested a former government vice 
minister on charges he took bribes from a japanese conglomerate the 
latest bombshell in a widening stock scandal that has tainted the 
highest echelons of power 
the tokyo district public prosecutors office arrested takashi 
kato 58 the former vice minister of labor and the highestranking 
public official yet arrested in the scandal 
kato was charged with accepting bribes from recruit co in 1986 
when he bought bargainpriced stocks in recruitcosmos co a 
subsidiary he allegedly earned about 56000 in profits when he 
later sold the stock after the company went public and share prices 
skyrocketed 
prosecutors allege that kato in return for the stock deal 
influenced a ministry decision on publishing employment information 
that would benefit recruit an information conglomerate 
prosecutors today also arrested masao tatsumi 46 a recruit 
executive who they claimed conspired with recruits founder and 
former chairman hiromasa ezoe in bribing kato 
the arrests brought to 12 the number of scandalrelated arrests 
ezoe was apprehended feb 13 on bribery charges 
two minor recruit co officials were released tuesday and 
prosecutors have yet to decide whether charges will be formally 
filed against them 
katos arrest had been widely anticipated since prosecutors last 
month arrested shigeru kano a junior officer to kato on bribery 
charges prosecutors today also searched katos residence in 
yokohama along with several recruit branch offices in tokyo 
the stock scandal in which more than 150 politicians public 
officials and business leaders were offered bargain shares in 
recruitcosmos and earned handsome profits has rocked the 
administration of prime minister noboru takeshita since last summer 
many politicians including takeshita and former prime minister 
yasuhiro nakasone have been linked to the widening scandal after it 
was revealed their aides had purchased thousands of the lowpriced 
shares 
three cabinet ministers including finance minister kiichi 
miyazawa have already stepped down after their involvement in the 
scandal was revealed 
meanwhile opposition parties stalled deliberations in the diet 
the japanese parliament on the nations budget and demanded the 
takeshita administration resign en masse or summon nakasone to the 
diet for questioning on his involvement 
without nakasone appearing in the diet we cannot participate 
in the session said shun ohide an official of the japan 
socialist party the nations largest opposition group 
you must resign now mr takeshita said socialist party 
chairman takako doi at a speech in northern japan on tuesday night 
if you cant resign en masse you must dissolve the diet and 
appeal to the confidence of the people by calling for an election 
takeshita repeatedly has called for political reform in efforts 
to leave the scandal behind but almost daily developments have 
caused the administrations popularity to plunge in media polls 
the newspaper yomiuri shimbun reported thursday that of 2211 
adults polled just 213 percent said they supported the takeshita 
administration down 61 percentage points from a similar poll in 
january 
the january polls findings marked first time below 30 percent 
for takeshita since he became prime minister in november 1987

tired of the nine to five grind see more of 
the world in a month than most people see in a lifetime the 
helpwanted ad said 
the job flight attendant at eastern airlines 
never mind that the nations seventhlargest airline has 
furloughed 9500 employees grounded almost all of its flights and 
is teetering on the brink of ruin 
approximately 20 young men and women showed up at a washington 
hotel on a cold snowy tuesday to answer the ad that appeared in 
sundays washington post 
the eastern official who did the interviewing jeff bowen 
insisted the ad was not placed in anticipation of the strike that 
hit the airline saturday 
what we are doing is trying to fill the commitment we made in 
the newspaper ads rather than lock the door we had no idea we 
would be faced with this situation bowen said 
members of local 533 of the transport workers union which 
represents the flight attendants scoffed at the claim 
theyre hiring scab flight attendants to replace us said 
teal carter a stewardess with eastern for five years as she 
picketed outside the hotel 
judy coughlin secretarytreasurer of the local said eastern 
conducted similar interviews in miami on sunday and monday and in 
boston on tuesday and planned to do so in new york today 
we are meeting these people at every hotel ms coughlin 
said we have had great success in convincing people to turn away 
we handed them a flier and told them about other airlines that were 
hiring flight attendants and would pay them more money and we said 
please come back some day when things are better at eastern 
the pickets drew the support of local 25 of the hotel and 
restaurant employees union which represents workers at the 
washington hilton hotel where the interviews were held 
ron richardson executive secretarytreasurer of the local said 
he telephoned william h edwards jr general manager of the hotel 
monday night and asked him to throw eastern out of there 
his response was that they had already rented the place and 
they couldnt legally get out of it but that it was just that one 
morning and he did not think they would be back richardson said 
it is strange for a union company to hold a meeting of that 
nature in a union hotel said edwards it was a situation that 
they could have avoided i dont foresee it happening again 
peter chatilovicz labor counsel for the washington hotel 
association said he spoke with easterns lawyers about the matter 
tuesday 
the jobseekers meanwhile were mostly oblivious to the furor 
over eastern 
i want a job said a young woman who would identify herself 
only as barbara i really didnt know about the controversy that 
was going on 
she said company interviewers did not talk to her about the union 
or tell her that people were being laid off she also said she was 
not given encouragement that she would get a job 
dennis jones an unemployed washington resident said he was not 
aware that eastern had been struck and was furloughing employees he 
said he just wanted to work for an airline 
we are not passing out applications said bowen we are 
just trying to get an idea of those individuals who would be 
interested in working for eastern in the event that we had to do 
some replacement of flight attendants

paul barkley the president and chief executive 
of ps group who helped guide pacific southwest airlines through the 
deregulation of the airline industry announced that he will resign 
in april 
its time to give it to another generation barkley said 
tuesday i had a contract that said i could go home when i was 60 
i will be 60 next month so im going home 
ps groups board of directors named george shortley as barkleys 
successor shortly 48 joined psa in 1968 as controller and 
currently serves as executive vice president of the firm 
barkley will remain a member of the board of directors of ps 
group and chairman of its exeucitve committee 
ps group was the parent company of psa until it sold the san 
diegobased carrier to usair last year ps group then emerged as a 
liquid investment company that is building one of the nations 
largest travel networks as well as leasing aircraft and selling fuel 
to us airlines 
barkley quietly led the company and kept it stable during the 
deregulation period said russell ray former psa president who is 
now the vice president for commercial marketing for douglas aircraft 
co 
im happy for the calm but it certainly isnt the same world 
as the heated days of cutthroat competition in the deregulated 
airline industry barkley said it was a tough business to be in 
but it was exciting and dramatic 
the most difficult year in psas history was 1978 the year that 
deregulation was announced he said 
a collision over san diego that year involving a psa jet and a 
private plane killed 144 people including 37 psa employees 
fuel prices began to climb in 1978 prompting psa to make the 
tough choice of buying a new fleet of aircraft for short flights to 
replace its gasguzzling 727s

tortellini ravioli and manicotti will soon 
be added to the cookies crackers and snacks sold by keebler co if 
the proposed buyout of a tolucabased frozen pasta manufacturer goes 
through as planned 
keebler has signed a letter of intent to purchase bernardi 
italian foods a family business which traces its roots to 1932 and 
a small restaurant run by the son of italian immigrants 
today bernardi employs about 120 people in the production of 
about 40 varieties of fresh and frozen pasta which it distributes 
nationally and in canada 
they are going through our books right now and were supposed 
to close the deal in midapril jerry bernardi chief executive of 
the pasta company said tuesday 
terms of the proposed sale were not disclosed 
but nothing is going to change here bernardi said its 
going to be business as usual and everything will remain under the 
bernardi label we will be a subsidiary of keebler operated 
independently my son dick and i are even going to continue to run 
it 
keebler spokesman stuart greenblatt at company headquarters in 
the chicago suburb of elmhurst said the purchase of bernardi was 
tentative and requires the approval of keeblers parent company 
united biscuits holdings plc of london 
greenblatt said the acquisition would give keebler which ranks 
second to nabisco with 1 billion annual sales of cookies snacks 
and crackers a foothold in the lucrative and growing pasta food 
market 
i wouldnt say were looking to get into frozen pasta 
greenblatt said bernardis is a good fit with our current food 
service operations and we have a frozen snack bread product so 
were already into frozen foods 
but this would be our first pasta operation 
bernardis interest in the pasta business dates back to 1932 when 
his father nildo mona bernardi opened a restaurant in toluca 
a town of 1500 located about 40 miles north of peoria 
bernardi 58 joined his father in the restaurant and in 1969 he 
bought a machine that automatically makes the family specialty 
tortellini 
the machine allowed bernardi to replace five women who produced 
about 150 pounds of tortellini each week by hand production the 
machine could match in one day 
bernardi began massproduction of the pasta in an old 
meatpacking plant and in 1980 entered the frozenfood business 
marketing his product under his fathers nickname monas 
along with frozen tortellini bernardis menu includes 
precooked filled pastas such as ravioli and manicotti other 
items include lasagna and rotini and raw pastas such as egg noodles 
fettuccine and gnocchi 
the company also sells its own line of entrees with sauces 
bernardi originally sold tortellini and other pasta primarily to 
area restaurants school cafeterias and private institutions 
italian food and pasta has become extremely popular bernardi 
said in the last two years the growth has been tremendous

when biologist abigale alling steps inside 
an airlock shell begin a stay in what eventually will be a new 
world on earth 
starting late today ms alling is scheduled to live for five 
days inside a selfcontained environment a completely closed 
ecosystem independent of the air water and nutrients of earth 
which researchers call biosphere i 
her fiveday stay in the module is a precursor to a twoyear stay 
in a larger and more complex version of the airlock or biosphere ii 
project spokeswoman kathleen dyhr said researchers hope ms 
allings five days in the airlock will have no startling 
developments 
in similar but shorter experiments nothing dramatic happened 
which is exactly what we wanted she said nothing unusual goes 
on and then thats normal 
ms alling a 29yearold design coordinator for the biosphere ii 
project will be monitoring and studying the various systems that 
control the environment inside the sealed 15000cubicfoot 
glassandsteel spaceframe structure project managers on the 
outside will be doing the same 
ms allings heart and respiration rate and other vital signs 
also will be monitored during her fiveday stay 
i will be breathing air that is apart from earth water 
recycling will be apart from earth this is really a milestone 
ms alling said 
the nearly 25acre 7millioncubicfoot biosphere ii is under 
construction and in september 1990 eight researchers called 
biospherians will be sealed inside for two years 
the aim will be to see whether man can exist in a complex and 
evolving but completely enclosed world biosphere ii will have seven 
separate environmental systems including a tropical rain forest 
marsh and desert about 3800 plant and animal species are being 
selected for the project 
learning how to do a better job of stewardship of biosphere 
i will be the big payoff of biosphere ii said carl hodges 
director of the university of arizonas environmental research 
laboratory and a consultant on biosphere ii such global problems as 
air pollution acid rain and the greenhouse effect would be some of 
the issues studied he said 
the 30 million biosphere ii project is being undertaken by space 
biospheres ventures a private company funded largely by texas

quarter ending march 31 
the stock sank 850 a share to 5350 tuesday and was the most 
actively traded overthecounter issue with more than 5 million

in a news release microsoft predicted thirdquarter sales of

million expected by many market analysts 
microsoft had sales of 1618 million for the third quarter of 
last year and profits of 373 million the company said it expected 
profits for the current quarter to be somewhat less than a year 
ago 
shipments of microsofts new versions of its wordprocessing 
program microsoft word 40 for apple macintosh and word 50 for 
ibmcompatible computers were delayed and strong demand caused the

another mcdonalds is opening for business today 
but this one has the bragging rights of being the biggest in texas 
where customers can munch on a big mac and fries 
what also sets this 10000squarefoot twostory restaurant 
apart from others is that patrons can monitor the new york stock 
exchange on an electronic ticker at the restaurant receive 
telephone calls at their tables or fax their orders to pickup 
through a double drivethru 
were anticipating to do big business at this restaurant and we 
have every reason to believe itll be the most successful ever 
opened said brenda duncan senior marketing manager for 
mcdonalds corp which owns and operates the new 156seat 
restaurant in the galleria business center 
the hamburger palace is the first fastfood restaurant in the 
predominantly business area and was opened with the businessmans 
needs in mind ms duncan said 
were always looking into innovative ways to fill the needs of 
our customers and this is just one of those ways at the galleria 
she said 
a mcdonalds on new yorks wall street has a ticker tape and a 
los angeles restaurant has telephones at tables but the new 
galleria restaurant is the only one to incorporate all the 
amenities including the facsimile machine 
what patrons will find at the new restaurant is an upscale 
interior of teal blue mauve gray silver and black with marble 
accents instead of the bright red and yellow found at the other 134 
mcdonalds restaurants in houston 
we are targeting the business people that work there by putting 
amenities in the store that appeal to them the ticker tape and 
telephones at selected tables this way the businessman can continue 
to do work and eat their favorite mcdonalds meal she said 
aside from the usual menu of big macs and fries the restaurant 
also will offer fruitfilled breakfast tortes soup of the day 
freshly baked chocolate chip cookies and a lowcalorie whipped 
dessert 
the new restaurant represents mcdonalds largest investment in 
the state of texas and it shows how we feel about houston theres 
confidence here that houston is rebounding she said 
despite the bragging rights as the biggest mcdonalds restaurant 
in the state the new restaurant will be minus a huge golden 
arches sign 
mcdonalds officials originally wanted to place the sign on a 
42foot pole near the building to attract motorists from nearby 
interstate loop 610 but the hamburger chain yielded to pressure 
from area businessmen who complained the sign was too big 
and although the restaurant is the biggest mcdonalds in texas 
its just a small fry when compared with the chains largest outlet 
a 26000squarefoot restaurant in vinita okla that spans the 
will rogers turnpike

coleco industries incs board of directors has 
authorized management to explore a sale of the toy company as a 
means of solving its financial problems but no potential purchasers 
have been identified 
j brian clarke president and chief executive officer of the 
avon connbased company said the board took the action two weeks 
ago the committee representing colecos creditors in its bankruptcy 
case has also approved exploring a sale clarke said tuesday 
morton e handel colecos chairman said no purchase offers have 
been received he wouldnt say whether any talks with interested 
bidders have been held 
testifying in us district court in new york on tuesday clarke 
said selling the company is an alternative to proceeding with the 
debt repayment plan coleco has proposed 
coleco which filed in january for protection from creditors 
under chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code has proposed a plan for 
repaying some of its 5403 million in debts the creditors 
committee is fighting the plan saying it would give most creditors 
only 10 cents of every 1 coleco owes them 
us district judge prudence b abram put off a decision until 
april 4 on colecos request for approval of the plans disclosure 
statement which explains how much the company is proposing to pay 
each group of creditors 
abrams approval is needed before the plan can be sent to 
creditors for a vote which is necessary before coleco can emerge 
from bankruptcy protection 
abram saying coleco shouldnt be surprised that most creditors 
object so strongly to its plan reminded those in the courtroom of a 
popular 1960s song called wipe out 
thats exactly what the unsecured creditors perceive the plan 
offers them the judge said i cant think of another plan where 
ive seen the unsecured creditors so wholly wiped out as they are in 
this case 
many of those unsecured creditors are investors who own about 
335 million in coleco bonds 
the creditors committee on feb 14 filed a lawsuit against isaac 
perlmutter and bernard marden new york financiers who are the only 
secured coleco creditors meaning they are first in line for 
repayment 
colecos reorganization plan proposes that perlmutter and marden 
be repaid with stock and cash worth 70 million of the 80 million 
they are owed effectively giving them control of coleco 
the lawsuit questions business dealings the two had with coleco 
in the past two years and claims the men owe the company 71 million

amoco corp did something that michelangelo 
didnt and the oil company could wind up paying some 80 million 
for its artistic blunder 
amoco used white italian marble sheathing on the outside surface 
of its 80story headquarters building in downtown chicago but the 
marble has weakened over the years 
so all 43000 of them will be replaced with granite during a 
facelift that begins next month 
carrara marble which is whats on the building is 
beautiful says chicago architect walter netsch michelangelo 
used it but michelangelo didnt leave his work outside 
the repair job could cost up to 80 million before its completion 
in three years said shelby c pierce manager of engineering for 
amoco 
stainless steel strapping was installed last year to hold the 
350pound marble panels in place even though the clips that attach 
the slabs to the building have never failed a company spokesman 
said 
in late 1973 a winter storm caused a construction scaffold to 
hit a slab that fell and demolished a car said the spokesman mike 
thompson but he said that was before the building opened in 1975 
and no pieces have fallen since 
we decided to bite the bullet rather than continue forever on a 
maintenance program pierce said monday of the replacement 
project we decided to get it over with 
the replacement granite has a saltandpepper look up close but 
will be whiter than the marble when viewed from afar he said 
at 1136 feet the structure was the fourth tallest in the world 
when it was completed its still the tallest marblefaced building 
anywhere 
the marble was hauled from near carrara in north central italy at 
the direction of john swearingen then company chairman and his 
socially prominent wife bonnie 
now the company says it was a blunder to use the marble which 
has badly deteriorated over the past two decades 
tests show conclusively that many of the marble panels have 
lost strength and must utimately be replaced said pierce 
the old marble cannot be reused in building construction and no 
decision has been made as to what to do with it once its removed 
from the building 
its too weak for buildings and too warped for countertops until 
a buyer is found the marble will be piled up outside the 
headquarters said pierce 
the granite comes from a quarry in mt airy nc which is one 
of the worlds largest suppliers of gravestones 
this granite is very strong and stable said pierce i 
wanted to make sure that 15 years from now someone doesnt have to 
go through what im going through

commerce secretary robert mosbacher told 
congress today that private industry and not the government must 
take the lead in developing highdefinition television production in 
this country 
mosbacher said hdtv sales in this country could reach 140 
billion in the next 20 years and that the impact of hdtv will go far 
beyond entertainment uses he cited potential advances in education 
retailing and the military and said the united states must take a 
leading role in this developing industry 
but the private sector should remain preeminent in this 
effort he said and any us funds that are expended for research 
in hdtv should go to the domestic industry and not to foreign 
competitors 
in my view the private sector must take the leadand were 
the ones who will be getting the hindrances out of the way he 
said 
he suggested the government role could include tax incentives and 
possible antitrust exemptions for us manufacturers of hdtv 
products he said development of a government policy in this regard 
has the highest priority at the commerce department and that he 
expects to be able to make a recommendation to congress on the 
government role in the next two months 
a private study released tuesday said the united states must move 
aggressively into the new highdefinition television and flatscreen 
display industries or lose more than 2 million jobs annually and 
suffer a 225 billion trade deficit in electronics by the year 2010 
if the united states does not compete effectively with the 
japanese and other nations in the hightechnology arena the 
personal computer and semiconductor industries alone could have 
respective deficits of 114 billion and 76 billion early in the 
next century the report from the economic policy institute said 
its author robert cohen said our nation stands at a critical 
juncture if we do not create a strong industrial base centered on 
development of hdtv and flatdisplay screen technology it will not 
only weaken our industrial base but also reduce the numbers of 
skilled jobs that are needed to make us more competitive 
proponents of hdtv claim it can provide motion picturequality 
images on flat television or computer screens using digital 
components 
japan expects to have an hdtv system in full operation by the 
mid1990s whereas the us telecommunications industry has barely 
begun testing of hdtv technology 
the us defense department is soliciting bids for companies to 
share in a 30 million hdtv research and development program 
cohen said hdtv technology will improve the entire food chain 
in the electronics industry 
hdtvs will be used in the home as display screens for personal 
computers and by the nations businesses to improve controls over 
automated production in auto steel and manufacturing plants to 
integrate video and print media in newspapers and for the 
collection and transmission of important medical results such as 
xrays and computer tomographs cohen said 
he said he based his study on findings recently released by the 
american electronics association according to the aea study a 
strong scenario represents a case in which 50 percent of the 
us market for hdtv is controlled by us companies in a weak 
scenario only 10 percent of the us market would be controlled by 
us concerns 
cohen said that with a strong hdtv base the us personal 
computer industry would attain an estimated 176 billion in sales by 
2010 in contrast to an expected 44 billion in sales with a weak 
hdtv sector 
in the semiconductor industry sales would be 99 billion in a 
strong us hdtv industry compared with 25 billion in a weak 
industry 
the trade imbalance in electronics could range from an estimated 
surplus of 10 billion under a strong hdtv program to a 227 billion 
deficit with a weak hdtv program cohen said 
in the employment area the personal computer industry could have 
588000 employees in 2010 under a strong hdtv scenario or 147000 
employees under a weak hdtv program he said 
in all related industries including hdtv receivers and vcrs 
automated manufacturing equipment personal computers and 
semiconductors there could be nearly 11 million jobs under a 
strong scenario and 274000 jobs under a weak program 
cohen said spinoff employment from a strong hdtv program could 
create another 11 million jobs even more if flatscreen display 
technology is used extensively in retailing education or in 
automobile assembly 
the economic policy institute is a laborbacked think tank based 
in washington

grain and soybean futures prices were trading 
mostly lower this morning on the chicago board of trade reflecting 
slack demand and forecasts for milder weather in the midwest and 
great plains 
pressure on the soybean market also stemmed from lower cash 
prices domestically and lower values for soybean meal and oil on 
overseas markets but analysts said losses in the soybean oil market 
were limited by perceptions that morocco and pakistan may be in the 
market for us soybean oil 
the corn and wheat markets also declined amid slow export demand 
despite rumors of new chinese or soviet buying interest in wheat 
an expected warmup to springlike conditions in the nations

pepsicola co changed its plans to run its new 
twominute commercial with pop star madonna on mtv last weekend 
after the cable network started running the singers potentially 
controversial new music video a source close to the soft drink 
maker confirmed wednesday 
the pepsi ad with madonna which was dubbed make a wish and 
included an abbreviated verision of her new song like a prayer 
debuted last thursday on what pepsi said were toprated television 
shows in 40 countries 
the next day the cable network mtv began running a separate 
music video designed to herald the launch of the singers new song 
the video shows madonna in a black slip dancing among burning 
crosses and seeking refuge in a church where she kisses a statue of 
a saint who comes to life 
pepsi had planned to run the twominute ad last weekend on mtv 
but withheld it while the video is running according to the source 
who spoke on condition he not be identified 
the source said the change in plans was motivated by a desire to 
avoid competing for attention with the video and not by worries 
about the controversy that could be stirred by the video 
carole robinson a spokeswoman for mtv said the network has 
received no complaints about the video which has been running since 
last friday 
liz rosenberg a spokesman for warner brothers records madonnas 
record label said the record company had received no complaints 
here about the video 
she said a staterun television network in italy delayed its 
plans to carry the video last weekend after a catholic group 
objected to what it had heard may be in the video but she said the 
network has since reviewed the video and plans to begin airing it 
within the next 10 days 
tod mackenzie a spokesman for pepsi declined to comment on 
whether the pepsi ad was withdrawn from mtv but said the company had 
not changed its overall ad campaign plans 
he said those plans were to air the twominute version of the 
commercial before the song was released and then air shorter 
versions of the twominute ad after the singers record had begun to 
rise on the record charts 
the single of madonnas song was released earlier this week and 
the album is due out later this month 
mackenzie said he could not say when the shorter ads will begin 
appearing

some of americas largest electronics concerns 
and some of their biggest foreign competitors have filed 
applications for startup money from the defense department to 
develop highdefinition television technology the pentagon 
announced today 
all told 87 proposals for funding were properly filed before the 
feb 27 deadline and will be evaluated over the next few months the 
pentagon said 
we are gratified by the extremely strong response from 
industry said craig i fields the deputy director for research 
of the defense advanced research projects agency or darpa 
many of the proposals are of impressive quality and they demand 
a careful evaluation he said 
the pentagon said the first contract grants could be awarded as 
early as april roughly 30 million in government grants is being 
set aside for the research effort 
despite some scattered congressional and industry opposition the 
pentagon announced in january it would not bar foreignowned 
companies from submitting requests for research funding 
the department cited federal procurement rules that call for fair 
and open competition and the fact that it is too early to assume 
that all of the necessary research andt to stay 
on the ground but in this modern age that is impractical for many 
 
the questions that must be asked and answered now are these 
should airlines be forced to retire their old airliners when 
they reach a certain age rather than continue to repair them what 
should be the criterion for an airliners retirement and does the 
aviation industry react quickly enough to correct the problems of 
aging aircraft once they become known 
for years the industry has argued that age alone is no reason to 
ground a plane permanently provided it is properly inspected and 
maintained but now airline engineers are correctly having 
second throughts 
the awful reality is that the faas tardiness actively 
contributes to the fear not to say the danger of airline 
travelers already alarmed by these midair calamities involving older 
aircraft 
that has to change and change quickly before more lives are 
sacrificed to the truly worrisome combination of ignorance and 
procastination

bangor maine daily news on john tower 
the controversy over the john tower confirmation has been 
stripped of all pretense that it is driven by lofty motives 
it is a power play by senate democrats and it deserves a tough 
response from president bush who should take his case for tower to 
the american people 
on monday the president made his strongest pitch yet for tower 
taking off one of his gloves at a washington speech before the 
veterans of foreign wars to warn that he is sick and tired of the 
rumors and innuendos that have proved such an obstacle to his 
appointee 
although such spunk is refreshing it clearly is time for 
the president to go beyond such a limited audience take off the 
other glove and sell the public on his extreme unhappiness with the 
senate confirmation process

amarillo texas daily news on speaking fees for members of 
congress 
many panicstricken members of congress who voted down a 51 
percent raise now seem to think they no longer are obliged to ban 
the acceptance of hefty speaking fees paid to them by lobbying 
organizations 
they are dead wrong from an ethical as well as a political 
standpoint 
one of the reasons for the huge proposed pay increase was to make 
it more palatable for lawmakers to stop padding their individual 
salaries with tens of thousands of dollars supplied to them by 
interest groups in the form of speaking fees 
such payments totaling more than 10 million a year are an 
insidious form of legalized bribery and congressional leaders 
acknowledged as much when they intiated steps to abolish speaking 
fees in exchange for the raise 
the chairman of president bushs new commission on federal ethics 
law reform retired federal judge malcolm r wilkey reflects the 
unsparing view of most voters the practice of speaking fees is 
evil 
joining a host of other ethicsminded groups the presidential 
panel has unanimously recommended that speaking fees and other 
outside payments from special interests be abolished irrespective 
of the question of a congressional raise 
this is the only step that will quell the voters justifiable 
wrath

the chief sponsor of a bill that would 
impose the states 75 percent sales tax on advertising says it has 
little chance of becoming law 
but sen william a dibella said he wants to keep all options 
open with the state facing huge deficits 
there wasnt much support for it was there dibella 
dhartford joked after a daylong hearing on the issue tuesday 
the proposal is not being given serious consideration as 
democrats look for hundreds of millions of dollars to erase this 
years deficit and balance next years budget 
dibella cochairman of the taxwriting finance committee 
estimates that such a levy would produce 120 million a year for the 
state 
dibella rejected arguments that the tax would hurt the economy 
saying it would simply be passed on to customers in the form of 
higher prices for products as most other taxes are 
under his proposal newspapers television stations and others 
accepting advertisements would collect the taxes from advertisers 
and pass them along to the state 
connecticut faces a 195 million deficit in the current year and 
democrat gov william a oneill has called for 737 million in new 
taxes to balance the 198990 budget taking effect july 1 
oneills tax package didnt include the advertising tax but he 
said again tuesday that he is willing to look at any proposal 
if the tax is enacted it would be the only one in the country 
florida imposed an advertising tax in 1987 but it was repealed 
later that year after a storm of protest from retailers and the 
media the florida experience was repeatedly mentioned during 
tuesdays hearing 
the committee heard hours of testimony from scores of people on 
the proposal and not one favored it a committee vote on the 
proposal could come as early as thursday 
most of those testifying said it would be self defeating and cost 
connecticut jobs they also said it would be difficult to administer 
and collect and would hurt new businesses competing for customers 
michael fisch a vice president of the hartford courant speaking 
on behalf of the 21member connecticut daily newspaper association 
told the committee that advertising is the spark plug of the 
economy 
susan weiner senior vice president for advertising for the may 
stores including g fox caldor lord amp taylor and filenes said a 
tax on advertising will depress advertising and related sales and 
will result in a decrease in sales tax revenues 
warren gould of the painters union in new haven whose members 
paint billboards said the tax would almost certainly result in 
layoffs 
typical of the media opponents was william j pape ii editor and 
publisher of the waterbury republican and american 
a tax on advertising would seriously and adversely affect the 
waterbury newspapers the retailers and businesses which rely on us 
to present their merchandise and services to the public and the 
public itself which would receive a diminished amount of 
information on which to base its buying decisions pape said 
inevitably sales tax receipts of the state will be reduced

three buildings at the fernald uranium 
processing plant stand over previously undisclosed radioactive 
ponds which may pose a threat to drinking water supplies a 
newspaper reported today 
officials of westinghouse materials of ohio which has operated 
the feed materials production center for the us department of 
energy since 1985 said efforts to address the problem have already 
begun 
plant memorandums from 1965 through 1968 indicate that up to five 
gallons a minute of uraniumbearing water mixed with nitric acid ate 
through brick flooring and drain systems of fernalds plants 2 and 3 
and the pilot plant the cincinnati enquirer reported 
the underground pools discovered beneath the three plants add to 
the problems of a production center already plagued by a 
25000gallon radioactive pool under plant 6 and six toxic and 
radioactive waste storage pits 
the memos describing the leakage were discovered among thousands 
given by the energy department to attorneys involved in a 300 
million classaction lawsuit neighbors filed against fernald 
graham mitchell fernald team manager for the ohio environmental 
protection agency said the information was not surprising 
weve had general knowledge that the refinery plants 2 and 3 
dealt with many more liquids than plant 6 did he said plant 6 
was kind of a surprise because it didnt deal with many chemicals 
so we had the feeling it wasnt the only one 
the danger of the underground pools is that the radioactivity 
could seep into drinking water supplies mitchell said but james 
reafsnyder the energy departments site manager at fernald said 
clay under the plant seems to have confined the contamination 
he said there is a plan to drill wells to assess the 
environmental risk 
fernald 18 miles northwest of cincinnati processes uranium for 
the federal governments nuclear weapons program 
energy department officials have refused to close the 1050acre 
37yearold plant saying its operations do not endanger residents 
or the environment but the department has begun a 10year 500 
million cleanup and modernization effort 
the plant is one of 16 nationally that produce nuclear materials 
for the department of energy several other plants are in various 
states of shutdown while health and safety problems are investigated

three members of a prominent chicago mercantile 
exchange broker group and another floor trader have been fined a 
total of 400000 and suspended for up to one month following 
allegations of violating merc rules according to their lawyer 
the merc charged that the brokers prearranged trades to 
circumvent limits on trades among members of the same broker group 
the violations occurred in the pit where futures contracts are 
traded on eurodollars attorney jeffrey cole said today 
richard lowrance who resigned from the exchanges board of 
governors last month was fined 200000 and suspended for 30 days 
cole said lowrance stepped down before an appearance before the 
merc disciplinary committee in the case 
david rothner received a 75000 fine and a 10day suspension 
patrick maloney was fined 25000 and barred from trading for five 
days floor trader brian elliott who was accused of serving an an 
intermediary in the violations was fined 100000 and suspended 30 
days according to cole 
the penalties were imposed in an agreement reached late tuesday 
under which the brokers neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing 
broker groups are teams of floor traders who fill public orders 
they are legal but have come under scrutiny by an fbi investigation 
into suspected fraudulent trading at the merc and cgation he said 
there is no doubt the fines were as high as they were because 
of the climate in which traders currently find themselves because of 
the federal investigation cole said 
last june maloney was fined 1000 for exceeding limitations on 
customer order filling in eurodollar futures rothner was fined 
1000 for a similar violation in eurodollar contracts in april 1988

lawyers for striking eastern airlines machinists 
argued today that a federal judge improperly barred railroad workers 
from honoring picket lines that could close down amtrak and new 
yorks commuter railroads 
the order by us district judge robert p patterson violated 
the clear command of the norrislaguardia act joseph guerrieri 
jr lawyer for the machinists told the 2nd us circuit court of 
appeals 
that law says federal courts cannot issue injunctions in labor 
disputes except in crossindustry secondary strikes 
patterson was wrong in enjoining unions from engaging in 
secondary boycotts said guerrieri the unions are free to 
engage in a full range of secondary activities 
patterson on tuesday extended until midnight friday his temporary 
orders barring strikes at amtrak and new yorks commuter railroads 
in sympathy with the eastern airlines walkout he scheduled a 
hearing for today on whether to issue a longterm ban on sympathy 
strikes 
an aide said the judge extended his temporary orders which 
would have expired at 3 pm today to allow himself time to rule 
before pattersons hearing the appeals court heard an appeal by 
the international association of machinists and the brotherhood of 
railroad signalmen of his temporary order 
the iam has said it may set up picket lines at the railroads and 
rail workers unions have said they would honor such lines that 
could severely disrupt rail transit 
the unions asked the appeals court to consolidate the three 
lawsuits brought by the various railroads into one case and delay 
pattersons restraining order or order him to throw it out 
but bernard m plum a lawyer for metronorth commuter railroad 
and the long island rail road argued that their employees are 
required to honor their labor contract until they have exhausted all 
noncourt remedies under federal railroad laws 
those contracts require people to come to work every day 
thats a basic obligation said plum 
plum said that under the railway labor act the question is 
that they first had to go to those procedures before it was 
determined if they could honor picket lines 
appeals court judge irving r kaufman noted whatever we do 
really is meanigless because youre going to right to the supreme 
court either side wont they 
plum conceded the parties probably would given what is at 
stake 
the appeals panel which included judges george c pratt and 
richard j cardamone as well as kaufman said it would issue a 
decision later today 
amtrak the lirr metronorth and new jersey transit sought and 
won the temporary orders from patterson forbidding walkouts

us rep richard ray a witness at the first 
of 15 hearings on the federal crop insurance program said the 
program is wasteful and fails to provide farmers with fair and 
equitable protection 
our country is in tough times right now the congressman said 
tuesday were looking for a decade of economic stagnation our 
debt of 28 trillion and our interest payments have gotten us 
in such a situation that we must not waste dollars the bureaucratic 
way in which the federal crop insurance group was put together 
causes us to waste a lot of federal dollars we need to refine 
that 
ray a democrat who represents georgias largely rural 3rd 
district was among 27 witnesses who lined up to testify before the 
commission for the improvement of the federal crop insurance 
program the 25member commission created by congress to protect 
more farmers from droughts and other disasters will hold hearings 
in 14 states 
ray noted that crop insurance reform has the backing of key 
georgia lawmakers including sens sam nunn and wyche fowler and 
said he is optimistic such legislation could win congressional 
approval 
kellye eversole the commissions executive director said 50 
crops including peanuts tobacco soybeans and peaches are 
eligible for crop insurance growers can select policies that cover 
50 percent 65 percent or 75 percent of their average yields 
ms eversole said concern about the nations record budget 
deficit could mean farmers will have to rely more heavily on crop 
insurance rather than disaster payments 
were trying to find out what is wrong with the crop insurance 
program and why participation is so low she said noting just 17 
percent to 27 percent of the nations farmers opt for crop coverage 
wilbur gamble chairman of the georgia peanut commission said 
the two chief objections of georgias 10500 peanut growers is that 
crop insurance penalizes growers who have had low yields because of 
disasters and forces growers to insure all of their crops rather 
than acreage that faces the greatest risk 
the risks in farming are great and government rules and 
regulations are constantly changing he said these factors have 
led to higher costs of production and low prices we believe it is 
extremely important to help farmers bear the unpredictable risks 
of farming 
johnny deal a vice president of the sea island bank in 
statesboro said his bank requires borrowers to have crop insurance 
on at least some of their crops 
in many instances we will have insurance only on peanuts or in 
some cases tobacco he said only a small percentage of our 
farmers carry federal crop insurance on corn wheat soybeans or 
cotton their reasoning is that the premium is too high for the 
dollar amount of coverage they receive 
another banker sam way president of the planters bank in 
hawkinsville said banks may decide to grant fewer agricultural 
loans unless the crop insurance program is improved

japanese investment in us real estate rose 
nearly a third last year with california attracting more investment 
than any other state and los angeles more than any other city a 
study says 
japanese investors spent a record 1654 billion on us real 
estate in 1988 up from 1277 billion in 1977 to boost their 
holdings to a total of 4288 billion according to the study by 
kenneth leventhal amp co an accounting firm 
california ranked first among the states with 562 billion in 
japanese investments in 1988 followed by new york at 28 billion 
and illinois at 187 billion according to the study released 
tuesday 
los angeles topped all cities with 305 billion with new york

the norwegian state bank said wednesday the 
countrys economic health appears to be improving following tough 
government measures but that rising unemployment is a 
worsethanexpected side effect 
there has been signficant progress norges bank said in its 
quarterly report wednesday 
the central bank praised recent negotiated and legislated wage 
limits but said unemployment which doubled in one year to 39 
percent in february was higher than expected another 2 percent of 
the jobless were employed in extraordinary government programs 
there is no simple way to reduce unemployment but it is vital 
that the measures used do not undermine efforts to turn the 
norwegian economy around said the report 
central bank president hermod skaanland said he did not foresee a 
prompt decline in unemployment but that state intervention will 
probably not overstimulate domestic demand 
income from norways north sea oil fields now pumping 144 
million barrels per day plummeted with the 1986 oil price collapse 
at the peak of a domestic spending and borrowing spree 
such earlier measures as interest rate hikes and legislated wage 
limits now extended to march 31 1990 helped turn norways trade 
deficit into a january surplus of 37 billion kroner or 552 
million and reduce 1988 consumer spending by 16 percent

the chairman of the house banking committee 
today rejected suggestions from the savings and loan industry that 
banks be forced to help pay for the sampl crisis 
sampl lobbyists are urging congress to combine the separate 
insurance funds for commercial banks and savings institutions 
president bush under his plan to revitalize the industry would 
maintain separate funds administered by one agency 
i believe one drowning man is enough rep henry b gonzalez 
dtexas told reporters 
industry representatives also received little sympathy tuesday 
from either senate banking committee members or from representatives 
of banking groups 
bush would increase the deposit insurance premiums paid by 
savings and loans and force their owners to invest more of their own 
money or capital within two years 
barney r beeksma president of the us league of savings 
institutions the largest sampl trade group told the senate committee 
that the bush plan by burdening healthy sampls means less mortgage 
money will be available and housing will be denied to millions of 
households 
we seek to make our contribution at a level that will not be so 
burdensome as to weaken our institutions and thus exacerbate further 
the current crisis beeksma said 
the lynchmob mentality is rampant today unjustly threatening 
the innocent majority of sampls along with the handful of 
scoundrels he said 
both beeksma and bud koch president of the national council of 
savings institutions asked senators to phase in the stricter 
capital standards over five years instead of two arguing that most 
institutions could meet the standard over time 
the current timetable is totally unrealistic koch said 
maryliz meany a spokeswoman for the american bankers 
association called the leagues proposal to make commercial banks 
pay for sampl problems a deadly prescription for a dangerous 
disease 
they seem crazy with desperation she said their backs are 
against the wall and theyre not thinking straight 
the bankers group supports the bush plan 
sen john heinz rpa said sampl groups by asking for more time 
on the capital standards invite us by ignoring the lessons of 
history to relive it richard h bryan dnev characterized the 
industrys position as lets have business as usual 
sen richard shelby dala saying the league had in the past 
tried to play down sampls poor condition told the lobbyists you 
have no credibility here today 
im sure you all have lots of friends here but less than you 
used to said sen phil gramm rtexas 
however sen larry pressler rsd said he would press for 
provisions to ease capital requirements for smaller savings and 
loans such as those in his state 
bush last month proposed spending about 150 billion over 10 
years half of it from taxpayers to close or sell insolvent sampls 
he also would restructure the regulatory system by giving the 
treasury department control over the federal home loan bank board 
critics have charged the industry with exerting too much influence 
over the sampl agency 
the league but not the national council opposes bushs effort 
to exert greater administration control over sampl regulators 
sen jake garn of utah the senior republican on the committee 
said industry influence on regulators could be reduced without 
turning over control to what he called the gnomes of treasury

eastern airlines today endured the fifth day of its 
machinists strike with a major court defeat that keeps its pilots 
out of its planes but a federal appeals court refused to allow 
sympathy strikes at commuter railroads in the new york area 
the pilots union said its members at other airlines would follow 
all safety rules to the letter again today at whatever cost in 
service delays the clearest effect on travel however was at 
eastern which was forced to lay off 9500 employees this week and 
ground most flights because of pilots support of the 8500member 
machinists union strike over easterns demand for contract 
concessions 
on tuesday us district judge edward b davis denied easterns 
request for a temporary injunction forcing the airlines 3600 
pilots to return to work despite warnings from easterns attorney 
that the company faced imminent bankruptcy proceedings if pilots 
werent forced to cross picket lines 
the airline flew just 57 flights of its northeast shuttle on 
tuesday and 41 flights were used to return stranded planes to home 
bases from south america and other points eastern spokesman jim 
ashlock said today before the strike eastern had more than 1000 
flights daily 
eastern which has only 1500 employees of a prestrike work 
force of 31200 still working and contends it has no business on 
the books said it planned to file an appeal this afternoon with 
the 11th us circuit court of appeals in atlanta 
eastern spokesman robin matell said the option to file for 
protection from creditors under federal bankruptcy laws remains a 
course of last resort however some union leaders have contended 
that frank lorenzo chairman of eastern owner texas air corp has 
planned all along to tear the carrier apart 
mr lorenzo has obviously not got the trust and confidence of 
his company a company doesnt work unless its a team us 
transportation secretary samuel k skinner said today on cbs this 
morning 
congress cant get involved and the president cant get 
involved you dont create a working relationship between a company 
and its employees by congressional act and you cant keep letting 
the situation deteriorate skinner said 
the pilots union reported that eastern management called its 
negotiators tuesday evening to try to set up new talks for their 
contract which expired in june 1988 union spokesman jb stokes 
said today that the contact was just a telephone conversation a 
contact were officially supposed to meet march 9 
the ruling in miami against eastern is a victory for labor in 
general eastern pilots leader jack bavis told a raucous rally of 
nearly 3000 striking employees gathered downtown tuesday night for 
a teleconference beamed by satellite to 11 other groups across the 
country 
all of us or none of us chanted the crowd of strikers who 
jammed miamis knight center 
earlier about 200 nonunion workers most of them among those 
laid off this week demonstrated on company property across from 
pickets shouting we want our pilots back 
about 60 percent of the 40000member air line pilots association 
on tuesday followed its request that rule books be stringently 
observed said capt roger hall a union spokesman 
the job action began tuesday and could cause major flight delays 
around the country but hall said the reports we have are that 
there has been no effect on operations 
there were minor delays in arrivals at la guardia airport in new 
york this morning that might have been caused by a pilots slowdown 
said allen morrison a spokesman for the port authority of new york 
and new jersey this morning no major delays were reported at 
ohare international airport in chicago 
there have been sporadic requests for special handling by 
flight crews said faa spokesman mort edelstein the number is 
very few it hasnt disrupted the system 
president bush meanwhile refused to budge from his opposition 
to government intervention to halt the walkout that the machinists 
union representing mechanics and ramp service workers began 
saturday 
a us house panel however approved a bill that would compel 
bush to appoint an emergency board to study the 17month contract 
dispute and issue a recommendation the action would include a 
coolingoff period of up to 60 days in which striking employees 
would return to work 
pilot leaders were trying to get support for the bill which is 
not expected to reach the house floor before next week lawmakers 
concede there are not enough votes in congress to override an 
expected presidential veto 
bush told reporters the strike at eastern the nations 
seventhlargest airline should be settled through bargaining and 
the president said if the machinists try to shut down rail service 
later this week he will ask congress to ban such secondary boycotts 
secondary boycotts particularly in the new york metropolitan 
area could disrupt commutes for hundreds of thousands of people 
unions representing workers at three suburban new york rail lines 
have appealed a federal judges order issued last weekend barring 
them from honoring any machinist picket lines set up at railways 
the judge has extended his order originally set to expire this 
afternoon through friday 
a threejudge panel of the 2nd circuit court of appeals heard 
arguments this morning and later refused to lift an order barring 
commuter railroad workers in the new york area from honoring any 
picket lines set up by striking machinists 
us district judge robert p patterson was wrong in enjoining 
unions from engaging in secondary boycotts said machinists lawyer 
joseph guerrieri jr the unions are free to engage in a full range 
of secondary activities 
appeals court judge irving r kaufman noted whatever we do 
really is meaningless because youre going right to the supreme 
court either side wont they the lawyer for two of the 
railroads conceded that was likely 
eastern which carried 100000 passengers on 1040 flights daily 
before the strike has continued operating only its shuttle between 
washington new york and boston and three round trips weekly 
between miami buenos aires argentina and santiago chile 
the airline wants 150 million in concessions the machinists 
want 50 million in raises eastern has said it lost more than 1 
billion this decade and 1 million a day before the strike

soybean futures prices closed sharply lower 
wednesday on the chicago board of trade as speculators were unnerved 
by the looming brazilian harvest and an increase in farmer selling 
grain futures fell in sympathy with soybeans 
soybean growers in brazil the worlds secondlargest producer 
after the united states are preparing to harvest their largest crop 
ever 
the movement of brazilian and then argentine soybeans into 
the global pipeline will help ease the supply tightness that has 
contributed to the markets recent firm tone 
the agriculture department has estimated brazils 198889 soybean 
crop at 20 million metric tons compared with 178 million the 
previous year on wednesday a widely watched private weather 
service raised its brazilian soybean estimate to 207 million metric 
tons from 196 million 
i think the real qustion is not whether its going to be a 
record but how much of a record said ted mao a grain specialist 
with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
mao said a rise in soybean prices over the past 10 days had 
prompted more selling of stockpiled beans by us producers 
at the close wheat was 1 cents to 4 cents lower with the 
contract for delivery in march at 430 a bushel corn was cent to 
2 cents lower with march at 275 a bushel oats were 1 cents to

some eastern airlines pilots arent as quick as fellow strikers 
to vilify boss frank lorenzo with shrieked epithets and shredded 
effigies they want to reach him through christian dialogue and the 
scriptures 
a group of pilots and other employees at striketorn eastern are 
praying that someone sends christian witness to frank lorenzo 
said bob fuhrman who has flown for eastern for 16 years 
we need some dignity we need our voices to be heard fuhrman 
told a reporter as he stood on a picket line tuesday in the empty 
eastern terminal at atlantas sprawling hartsfield international 
airport 
fuhrman 43 said there are about 1000 members in easterns 
branch of the fellowship of christian airline personnel including 
about 100 pilots the other members include eastern flight 
attendants mechanics baggage handlers and ticket agents 
many angry eastern workers have screamed down with lorenzo 
on airport picket lines up and down the east coast on the first 
night of the walkout strikers outside the airlines miami office 
tore up lorenzo effigies and held placards reading frank lorenzo 
we are your worst nightmare 
fuhrman has a quieter message for the chairman of easterns 
parent texas air corp 
mr lorenzo i hope that you know the love of jesus christ and 
if you dont i hope that the holy spirit guides you to knowing the 
love of jesus christ we pray that if we can find that common bond 
and we can stand in gods love and wisdom we can run eastern 
airlines 
we need the dignity and we need the respect and we need your 
love mr lorenzo 
efforts to reach lorenzo for comment werent successful he has 
remained largely out of sight since the strike began a texas air 
spokesman ned walker did not immediately return telephone calls 
from the associated press 
easterns rival delta air lines has succeeded where eastern has 
failed partly because atlantabased delta has a christian 
philosophy fuhrman said 
i think they run the airline by christian philosophy at delta 
theyre there for the family if someone has a problem theyre 
there said fuhrman who was furloughed as a pilot for 4 years 
starting in april 1973 and spent some of the time as an airline 
cleaner his wife brenda has been a flight attendant at eastern for 
12 years 
fuhrman wrote president bush in midfebruary asking him to 
intervene in the eastern dispute by extending the 30day coolingoff 
period that ended at midnight last friday triggering the strike 
president bush i know we both share a faith in the lord jesus 
christ fuhrmans letter read i ask of you in gods wisdom to 
consider my request so that we might know the mind of god 
concerning the situation at eastern which affects the lives of so 
many people 
fuhrman said he didnt receive a reply from bush who has stated 
several times he wouldnt intervene

metropolitan foods europe and pillsbury international to aid 
international expansion of pillsburys food brands 
ian martin chairman of pillsbury and a grand met director said 
proceeds from the restaurant sale would be invested in the growth of 
its pillsbury foods and burger king units to enhance our 
shareholders investment 
we received several expressions of interest he said but the 
deal from the investorled group was the only one to be clearly in 
the best interests of the pillsbury co grand met shareholders and 
sampa employees 
stephen carnes an analyst at the investment firm piper jaffray 
amp hopwood said the sale should have positive effects for pillsbury 
the longterm winner is obviously burger king he said

us automakers are likely to relay more on sales 
incentives than on production cuts to reduce swollen inventories of 
unsold cars analysts say 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp have been 
maintaining production levels that have led to a big rise in the 
number of automobiles on hand 
the authoritative wards automotive reports said that at the end 
of january there was an 85day supply of of cars made by usbased 
companies in inventory up from 67 days at the end of december 
although incentives tend to cut into the automakers profits 
they are more appealing to customers and autoworkers who want to 
keep production high 
its becoming increasingly clear that if you can maintain 
production volumes at a fairly steady pace its easier to control 
raw materials your work force is happy and ultimately your 
warranty costs come down said analyst john kirnan of kidder 
peabody amp co of new york 
i think theyre going to hesitate on the cutting production 
route as long as possible and rely heavily on incentives kirnan 
said wednesday 
gms inventory was reported at 95 days fords at 80 days and 
chryslers was at 89 days the weekly journal said 
higher inventories early in the year arent particularly 
worrisome to automakers since january and february sales typically 
are slower than other months and companies sometimes build up their 
supplies before the usual spring sales rush 
however there is some concern on wall street 
to the extent that inventory stays up and sales go down 
something has to give said analyst carol verschell of moodys 
investors service inc of new york eventually there will have to 
be an adjustment cut production or increase incentive programs 
gm has done both 
earlier this week the nations no 1 automaker extended some 
existing incentives into april and may and created new ones in an 
effort to lure buyers to dealers showrooms last week gm doubled a 
twoweek shutdown of its doraville ga oldsmobile cutlass supreme 
assembly plant because as plant manager f thomas brady said 
weve got too many cars out in the field 
chrysler did not immediately match gms new incentives but its 
existing enticements have no time limits on the same day gm issued 
its new incentives ford vice chairman harold poling said his 
company would remain competitive with other car makers marketing 
schemes 
ford is in better shape for months the no 2 automaker has been 
producing more than 15 percent of its vehicles on overtime meaning 
ford can withstand a sales slump and still remain at full production 
chrysler meantime has been struggling in sales as a number of 
its factories change over to new models or begin ramping up 
production of newly introduced cars 
last week chrysler vice chairman gerald greenwald said the big 
three would be tested this month when sales are expected to rise 
from january and february levels amid continued reliance on 
incentives 
car sales by the big three are down 106 percent during the first 
two months of this year compared with january and february of 1988 
february car sales for gm ford and chrysler were 144 percent below 
the pace for the same month last year 
verschell and kathleen heaney of nikko securities co 
international inc wondered whether the usual spring buying surge 
would be enough to shrink inventories to levels easing pressure to 
boost incentives or cut production 
there are just so many cars out there fighting for the same 
consumer verschell said 
i dont think its going to be enough to reduce it heaney 
said 
but kirnan was more bullish about spring sales saying the 
inventory problem will probably disappear by late march and early 
april and production schedules are probably going to be maintained 
for the second and third quarter 
i just dont the kirnan added i think thee degree that 
some people believe kirnan added i think the traditional types 
of incentives are going to continue to do some magic

having settled on a sour note tuesday night the market has 
really turned around said mary l haskins a vice president at 
drexel burnham lambert inc 
some of incentive for the turnaround came from reports 
circulating in the market of a conflict between iran and iraq 
before details of the reported conflict filtered fully through 
the market energy futures rallied temporarily with dealers buying 
in speculation that tensions between the two persian gulf countries 
might cause supply disruptions the buying lost momentum once it 
became clear in the market that the conflict referred to an incident 
that occurred in midfebruary 
but at the same time the rally drove crude past technical price 
thresholds that triggered more buying haskins said

major currencies in moderate trading as some traders concluded that 
the bush administration was showing flexibility on a tax increase to 
reduce the federal budget deficit 
gold prices declined after rising overseas republic national 
bank of new york quoted a bid of 39190 a troy ounce of gold around

of economic advisers as saying the administration has not ruled 
out a discussion of taxes as part of a formal budget negotiation 
boskin also said the administration has not abandoned its 
opposition to higher taxes his statements were consistent with 
those of other administration officials in recent weeks 
nevertheless the market chose to interpret boskins testimony as 
good news for the dollar robert ryan senior currency trader for 
irving trust co said bush is now conceding that he may allow 
higher taxes 
dealers said there were reports of the federal reserve selling 
small amounts of dollars to stem its rise wednesday but that most 
market participants saw that intervention as more symbolic 
i think they just wanted to remind us that they were still out

mexico has told the international monetary 
fund it aims to slash payments on its huge foreign debt to get its 
stagnant economy growing again two leading newspapers said 
wednesday 
the privately owned el financiero and the government newspaper el 
nacional said president carlos salinas de gortaris administration 
informed the imf in a draftletter of intent that it plans to reduce 
payments to 2 percent from 5 percent of the annual gross national 
product over the next three years 
el financiero said the letter was drafted after an imf team 
visited mexico city last week to evaluate an application for 500 
million in special drawing rights to bolster the countrys 
foreign currency reserves special drawing rights or sdrs are a 
type of international money created by the imf for use in settling 
international payment imbalances 
treasury secretary pedro aspe toured mexicos principal creditor 
nations in february unsucessfully seeking 100 million in fresh 
loans from private banks together with a reduction in the paper 
value of the countrys debt 
quoting unnamed government sources the two newspapers said the 
debt situation was analyzed by aspe and other members of the 
cabinets economic team at a meeting with salinas tuesday night 
government spokesmen refused to talk about the debt situation 
in due time we shall make the appropriate information public 
treasury department spokesman rafael diaz de leon replied in a 
telephone interview wednesday 
salinas wants to use money saved on debt payments to spur 
economic growth to about 45 percent annually el nacional said 
after two decades of 6 percent growth the economy completely 
stagnated under salinas predecessor president miguel de la madrid 
in part due to an austerity program put into effect to keep up with 
debt payments 
despite efforts to encourage nonpetroleum exports reduce 
government deficit spending and cut inflation the economy has 
remained in the doldrums 
salinas de la madrids budget secretary has been warning 
since he took office in december that mexico may be forced to 
suspend debt payments if it fails to wrest timely concessions from 
foreign creditors 
officials have been saying mexico wants to cut its annual service 
costs by about 7 billion from the 14 billion in principal and 
interest paid last year and the 16 billion scheduled for 1989 
the world bank estimates mexicos debt was 106 billion in 
december deputy treasury secretary jose angel gurria on tuesday 
denied the debt had gone up to 108 billion and said it was actually 
on 100 billion 
gurria said in a television interview that the public sector 
foreign debt currently stands at 81 billion the shortterm 
interbank debt at 7 billion the private sector debt at 7 
billion and the international monetary fund is owed another 5 
billion 
el financiero quoted the eightpage letter to the imf as saying 
the present debt situation is not acceptable or sustainable 
and it is urgent the mexican economy start growing again in 
order to check growing unemployment 
from 1982 to 1988 the economy failed to grow per capita income 
dropped some 15 to 20 percent the purchasing power of wages was 
halved the newspaper quoted the letter as saying 
the letter said mexico needs to create 1 million jobs annually 
just to take care of new entries in the job market but created only 
1 million jobs over the sixyear period 
on the positive side the letter noted that inflation was reduced 
from 159 percent in 1987 to 52 percent in 1988 and is projected at 
no more than 20 percent this year 
the letter said that during that period mexicos nonpetroleum 
exports have jumped from 3 billion to 14 billion last year 
roughly equaling the income derived from crude oil according to the 
newspaper

shareholders filed three suits in 
delaware state court wednesday to block the planned 18 billion 
merger between time inc and warner communications inc 
one of the suits filed by four warner shareholders against time 
and warner warners board of directors and warner chairman steven 
ross alleged the merger and a planned preliminary exchange of stock 
between the two companies known as a lockup transaction would 
prevent an outsider from making a possibly higher bid for warner 
in the lockup time will exchange 125 percent of its stock for 
12 percent of warners shares such transactions commonly are 
undertaken by companies planning to merge as a defense against 
unwanted takeovers 
the merger and lockup transaction are nothing more than a plan 
and scheme by the directordefendants to entrench themselves and to 
make it much more difficult and highly unlikely that warner will be 
subject to an outside takeover said the class action suit filed 
in delaware chancery court 
the suit asked the court to declare the merger void or 
alternatively prevent the defendants from proceeding with it 
the merger which would be accomplished through a stock swap 
would create the worlds largest communications concern time warner 
inc 
spokesmen for time and warner said their companies had no comment 
on the suit 
court papers for the other two suits were not immediately 
available and it was not immediately known who filed the actions or 
who the defendants were 
the suits were filed in delaware because time and warner are 
incorporated here

soybean futures prices fell as much as 10 cents a bushel 
wednesday erasing much of the past weeks gains as speculators 
unnerved by the looming brazilian harvest and an increase in farmer 
selling backed away from the market 
on other markets wednesday energy futures posted strong gains on 
signs of renewed tensions between iran and iraq precious metals 
retreated copper futures fell and livestock and meat futures 
finished mostly lower 
grain futures followed soybeans lower on the chicago board of 
trade wheat settled 1 cents to 4 cents lower with march at 430 a 
bushel corn was cent to 2 cents lower with march at 275 a 
bushel oats were 2 cents to 5 cents lower with march at 205 a 
bushel soybeans were 5 cents to 10 cents lower with march at 
755 a bushel 
soybean growers in brazil the worlds secondlargest producer 
after the united states are preparing to harvest their largest crop 
ever 
the movement of brazilian and then argentine soybeans into 
the global pipeline will help ease the supply tightness that has 
contributed to the markets recent firm tone 
the agriculture department has estimated brazils 198889 soybean 
crop at 20 million metric tons compared with 178 million the 
previous year on wednesday a widely watched private weather 
service raised its brazilian soybean estimate to 207 million metric 
tons from 196 million 
i think the real question is not whether its going to be a 
record crop but how much of a record said ted mao a grain 
specialist with shearson lehman hutton inc in new york 
us soybean growers harvested 154 billion bushels last year or 
about 41 million metric tons 
mao said said a rise in soybean prices over the past 10 days had 
prompted more selling of stockpiled beans by us producers 
oil futures rallied on the new york mercantile exchange following 
a report that irans united nations ambassador had accused iraqi 
soldiers of killing five iranian soldiers on feb 17 
the incident would mark the bloodiest clash between the middle 
eastern nations since the beginning of their 7month ceasefire 
the energy markets rally also was seen as partly a reaction to 
tuesdays weekly american petroleum institute report which showed 
declines in us stocks of gasoline and distillates although 
crudeoil supplies increased 
west texas intermediate crude oil settled 24 cents to 45 cents 
higher with april at 1854 a barrel heating oil was 29 cent to 
97 cent higher with april at 5137 cents a gallon unleaded 
gasoline was 44 cent to 83 cent higher with april at 5185 cents a 
gallon 
gold and silver futures retreated on new yorks commodity 
exchange selling off late in the session after gold for april 
delivery encountered resistance at 39880 a troy ounce 
bernard savaiko a metals analyst with painewebber inc in new 
york said april golds failure to close above 396 an ounce 
indicated the recent rally is tiring 
gold settled 30 cents to 60 cents lower with april at 39540 an 
ounce silver was 12 cents to 18 cents lower with may at 5947 a 
troy ounce 
copper futures also finished lower on the commodity exchange 
after initially rising analysts said the decline reflected 
perceptions that physical demand for copper has slowed with the 
metals rise in price during the past month 
copper settled 29 cents to 41 cents lower with may at 1404 a 
pound 
weakening cash markets contributed to a late slump in cattle 
futures on the chicago mercantile exchange most pork futures 
retreated on ideas that wednesdays increase in hog marketings would 
result in lower cash prices on thursday 
live cattle finished 25 cent to 45 cent lower with april at 
7712 cents a pound feeder cattle were 40 cent lower to 03 cent 
higher with march at 8165 cents a pound live hogs were 20 cent

eastern airlines slashed its shuttle fares and sold all its gates 
in philadelphia in the fifth day of a machinists strike wednesday 
and its sister carrier continental airlines took up the lucrative 
new yorkmiami run 
eastern in a desperate attempt to lure back customers to its 
ailing northeast shuttle service said it will reduce oneway fares 
to 12 on weekends from 6999 and 49 weekdays down from 99 
pilots at other airlines continued strictly adhering to safety 
rules but for a second day there was little evidence of a backup on 
runways 
houstonbased continental announced it would begin daily nonstop 
flights from new york citys laguardia airport to miami on thursday 
continental said it will run four daily round trips 
this is not a direct result of the eastern strike 
continental spokesman ned walker said of the new routes what this 
is is a response to market demand of what weve seen in the past 
few days 
in philadelphia usair announced it had closed a 70 million deal 
with eastern after months of talks to acquire all eight of the 
airlines gates at philadelphia international airport thirdlargest 
of the airlines four hubs 
usair said it will use the counter space along with baggage and 
related services for operations of piedmont airlines which will 
merge with usair this year 
eastern picked up 15 million more in a separate deal selling 
usair its philadelphiatornonto and philadelphiamontreal routes for 
15 million 
usair said both deals would require court approval if eastern 
declares bankruptcy 
the labor dispute rested wednesday with courts in new york 
philadelphia and atlanta where eastern went to court to appeal a 
judges refusal to order union pilots back to the cockpits 
eastern contends it is near collapse losing at least 2 million 
a day its lawyer said in court tuesday the nations seventhlargest 
carrier cannot survive the week if its pilots maintain their support 
for the machinists 
the airline is running just 4 percent of its flights and says it 
will consider bankruptcy court though as a last resort it sent 
9500 workers home this week and has just a skeleton staff of 1500 
remaining 
the 8500member machinists union walked out saturday and with 
the support of pilots and flight attendants soon nearly shut down 
eastern eastern is seeking 125 million in concessions the union 
wants 50 million in raises 
the machinists also threatened to disrupt commuter rail traffic 
with secondary boycotts which it contends are legal under the 1926 
railway labor act but the union held off when a federal judge in 
new york over the weekend temporarily barred rail workers from 
honoring machinists picket lines 
among developments 
the machinists have asked trans world airlines chairman carl c 
icahn to seek control of the carrier and he said he is willing to 
talk with them 
i would be willing to speak to the unions only if eastern 
permits me to because i do not want to be accused by eastern of 
interfering with the collective bargaining process icahn said in 
a statement 
icahn had mulled a bid for eastern a few months ago when its 
boss texas air corp chairman frank lorenzo was considering 
selling but icahn and the unions couldnt agree on terms for a 
worker stake in a merger of twa and eastern and talks broke off 
eastern had no comment charles e bryan president of machinists 
district 100 would not comment on icahns statement but said in 
miami if there is willingness by eastern to sell there are 
certainly interested parties it would be a tremendous 
opportunity to see the phoenix rise from the ashes 
in miami eastern marketing vice president george brennan 
denied that reduced shuttle fares were a move to protect the pending 
365 million sale of the shuttle service to new york developer 
donald trump competitor pan am corp said it would not match the 
fares 
in new york city the 2nd us circuit court of appeals refused 
to allow commuter rail workers in the new york area to honor any 
machinists picket lines but the judges said they expect the dispute 
to go to the us supreme court 
us district judge robert p patterson who issued the initial 
ruling heard arguments wednesday evening on whether to make 
permanent his ban covering amtrak long island rail road 
metronorth commuter railroad and new jersey transit the railroads 
carry hundreds of thousands of commuters 
patterson after 7 hours testimony recessed the hearing until 
10 am thursday he was not expected to rule immediately his 
orders barring strikes at amtrak and the other railroads expire at 
midnight friday 
eastern lawyers filed notice with a federal appeals court in 
atlanta on plans to continue efforts to force pilots to work i 
dont expect our brief to be filed until tomorrow morning said 
eastern attorney david ross 
in philadelphia a federal judge wednesday issued a preliminary 
injunction extending a temporary restraining order that prohibited 
rail unions from honoring pickets set up by machinists at 
southeastern pennsylvania transportation authority facilities which 
carry 100000 passengers daily 
the air lines pilots association whose contract with eastern 
expired in june said the airline has asked to set up talks union 
spokesman jb stokes said a meeting was set for thursday 
president bush has resisted calls from organized labor and some 
members of congress that he appoint an emergency panel to mediate 
but he has also said he will not tolerate disruptions throughout the 
transportation industry 
the president believes that in a free enterprise system workers 
in business should work out their differences without congressional 
or governmental interference transportation secretary samuel k 
skinner said wednesday on cbs this morning 
if bush intercedes an emergency panel could impose a 60day 
coolingoff period 
some union officials have said throughout the 17month dispute 
that eastern and lorenzo want to dismantle the airline 
our people have recognized from the very earliest days of this 
dispute that that kind of a result bankruptcy could be 
forthcoming said machinists union president william winpisinger 
they are so fed up with the way they have been treated so fed 
up with the environment on the job that theyre willing to walk 
away and if that is the result theyll accept it he said on the 
cbs program 
airports reported no problems on the second day of a worktorule 
action by union pilots around the country 
were operating close to normal said mort edelstein 
spokesman for the federal aviation administration there have been 
sporadic requests for special handling by flight crews such as 
having instructions repeated 
there are no problems john braden spokesman at hartsfield 
atlanta international airport weve got so much air space were 
looking for new carriers
