volunteers to help get rid of mines they planted more than 20 years 
ago here is a report on their journy by george esper who spent 10 
years covering the vietnam war for the associated press and is on 
his second reporting trip there since then

six former us marines visited their 
old battleground with a man who had been their enemy walking 
carefully to avoid unexploded mines laid more than 20 years ago 
dont go off the road its very dangerous a lot of people 
have been killed by mines col ho minh thanh told the americans 
who came as volunteers to help get rid of mines they had sown as 
young soldiers 
the americans were not carrying any equipment but they wanted to 
point out likely sites where mines may be concealed 
as the marines moved out on their patrol into the past trudging 
along the red dirt road of the alpha 3 artillery base thanh 
confirmed their suspicions that mines remained despite assurances 
by vietnams un ambassador that all had been cleared 
thanh said the region he commands in central vietnam still is 
laden with dangerous unexploded shells and many of the 100000 land 
mines planted in the late 1960s by the 11th marines an engineer 
battalion to which five of the visitors belonged 
we lost a lot of people even children people are still being 
injured and killed thanh said during the tour tuesday 
at another base at gio linh scores of poor women and children 
hacked in the ruins with hoes and shovels despite the danger 
searching for valuable scrap metal from shell casings 
thanh said soldiers and civilians had tried to clear the mines 
from around alpha 3 so rubber trees could be planted but there were 
too many he agreed with gene spanos a 39yearold police 
lieutenant from rosemont ill who organized the 10day inspection 
trip that something should be done 
can we go back and relay that information to your people in 
hanoi spanos asked the colonel would that be ok 
thank you we appreciate that thanh said 
thats why were here said spanos 
the american reported to thanh that the pentagon told him in a 
letter it had offered to help clear mines and dispose of unexploded 
shells some fired by the north vietnamese and some by us soldiers 
and their south vietnamese allies 
what the response was i dont know spanos said 
thank you very much for your good intentions thanh replied 
through the interpreter who translated their remarks for each other 
on a visit by the americans to the vietnamese un mission in new 
york three months ago ambassador trinh xuan lang told spanos all 
the mines had been cleared but the former marines were welcome to 
visit as tourists 
that is how they traveled in a van provided by the vietnam 
tourist bureau unofficial goodwill ambassadors whose expenses are 
being paid by an anonymous benefactor 
i knew damn well not all of those mines had been taken out 
said nate genna 41 of boston we laid over 100000 in a 
relatively small region 
the region included a string of us bases just below what was 
then the demilitarized zone dividing vietnam north and south at the 
17th parallel the country was reunited by north vietnams victory 
in april 1975 
i think there has been a reconciliation genna said its 
not after every war that guys come back who actually did the work 
and try to do something about it its a load off my mind i had my 
doubts all along this is awful all these years later 
spanos said weve accomplished everything we found out the 
vietnamese would not let us off this road for our safety and that 
it has been confirmed by a vietnamese commander who served in this 
area who still is in the army who is still aware and has 
acknowledged that there are mines in this area and people are still 
being injured still being killed 
he said he would send full reports to the us and vietnamese 
governments saying there are serious mine problems at three of the 
four bases they visited alpha 3 con thien just to the west and khe 
sanh where us marines withstood a 77day siege in 1968 
on their visit to khe sanh the former marines were restricted to 
the main road because of mines and unexploded shells 
spanos said his report would call attention to the dangers of gio 
linh the easternmost base where the women and children risked 
death for a possible prize 
their journey stirred memories for the americans 
marines put the first protective shield of mines around alpha 3 
at christmas 1967 said william johnson 41 of manchester conn 
frank noe 40 of stoughton mass looked at the red dirt and 
said there was a lot of heavy combat at this base as there was 
at con thien and gio linh we ran operations along the dmz a 
lot of guys died up around here 
his voice trailed off and he he walked away to weep alone

florida will not bargain with convicted 
killer theodore bundy to delay his scheduled execution in exchange 
for details of several unsolved murders in other states gov bob 
martinez said wednesday 
an attorney and adviser for bundy scheduled to be executed 
tuesday asked for a reprieve of up to three years so bundy could 
talk to law officers officials from washington state utah and the 
fbi have asked to interview bundy but have not sought any delay 
before his capture in florida bundy was on the fbis mostwanted 
list as a suspect in as many as 36 sexrelated murders or 
disappearances of young women in the northwest 
the governor who signed bundys death warrant tuesday shortly 
after the supreme court refused to hear his appeal in the 1978 
murder of a 12yearold lake city girl said bundy was once again 
trying to foil justice 
were not going to have the system manipulated said 
martinez one of the things to be made clear here to law 
enforcement which i think they realize more than anyone else what 
ted bundy has done is you dont negotiate with a murderer you 
dont negotiate with a killer 
he promised to make bundy available to any law agency in the days 
remaining before his execution 
bundys civil attorney diana weiner of sarasota told the 
governors deathpenalty lawyer andrea smith hillyer that bundy 
was committed to revealing all he knew about unsolved murders 
weiner didnt specify about which cases he had information 
ted bundy feels morally compelled as he faces death to do the 
right thing in terms of resolving any investigations she said 
while it may satisfyingly close the book on the florida cases the 
immediate execution will effectively cripple law enforcement 
agencies around the country 
martinez said he had no patience for any more appeals 
he has been in jail for 11 years he certainly could have come 
clean in other occasions but he has used the court now all of a 
sudden he wants to tell the truth said martinez 
bundy always has insisted that he is innocent of any murder 
bundy 42 also is under death sentences for fatally bludgeoning 
two florida state university sorority sisters 
bundys washington attorney james coleman said hes not 
involved in any attempt to delay the execution by talking about 
other cases but was planning an appeal on the question of bundys 
sanity 
coleman filed an emergency appeal through state circuit court in 
lake city and a hearing has been scheduled for thursday morning a 
court clerk said 
hillyer said bob keppel of the washington state attorney 
generals office planned to talk with bundy who is suspected in up 
to 20 killings and more closely linked to eight killings in that 
state 
she added that an official from the fbis national center for 
violent crime in quantico va wanted to interview bundy 
in utah salt lake county sheriff pete hayward said he is sending 
detective dennis couch to florida on saturday in hopes of 
interviewing bundy hayward said he hoped bundy a former university 
of utah law student could help authorities locate the bodies of any 
utah victims 
he hasnt indicated hed say a word to us but theres always 
that long shot that lastsecond chance that hell say ah bring 
them in lets see whats on their minds hayward said 
also announced wednesday was bundys decision reversing himself 
to grant a news media interview and bundys request for a personal 
interview with james dobson host of a pomona califbased radio 
show called focus on the family 
dobson said he has exchanged letters with bundy for the past two 
years he didnt know what bundy might want to talk about but hoped 
that if bundy has information about any other killings he would 
reveal it to help ease the victims families 
when a man is looking death in the face he doesnt waste words 
and i want to hear what he has to say said dobson who said his 
30minute radio show is carried on 1300 stations in 26 countries

about 2500 wealthy republican partisans 
unmindful of chanting protesters outside feasted on a 
1500aplate dinner of maryland crab and mushroomstuffed veal 
wednesday night and cheered george bushs declaration that im 
gonna try my level best to be a good president of the united 
states 
the presidentelect and his vice presidenttobe dan quayle 
toured three blacktie inaugural dinners two days before they take 
the oath of office and by the time they reached their final stop at 
union station bush said with a laugh that were exhausted 
bush thanked the gop faithful for helping him get elected nov 8 
and for their financial support that opened the four days of 
inaugural festivities to thousands of just plain folks 
i hope you enjoy the celebration he said weve earned it 
together 
after he was toasted with champagne and serenaded by the 
whiffenpoofs the famed glee club from his yale university alma 
mater bush drew a roar of approval from the crowd when he said he 
would try to be a good president and work for all the people of 
the united states 
said bush youve given me a chance and im not going to let 
you down 
then bush stepped down from the podium and shook hands with 
scores of wellwishers followed by his wife barbara and the 
quayles during their halfhour appearance 
before the dinner started several hundred protesters 
demonstrated outside union station for three hours and chanted at 
arriving limousines food for the poor not the rich and what 
about the homeless 
inside union station the blacktie guests expressed little 
concern about the message the demonstraters were shouting 
i feel its ridiculous said thomas j stewart a seattle 
business executive they hold these staged events every time 
republicans get together and its in very poor taste 
the people here have probably contributed more as individuals 
and corporations to the welfare of this country than anybody else 
said tulsa okla oilman jim hewgley if they want to celebrate 
then by god theyre entitled to 
several hundred protesters demonstrated for three hours shouting 
at the limousines that pulled up to the main entrance at union 
station with inaugural dinner guests but dispersed peaceably as the 
dinner began in midevening 
three hours before the start of the union station dinner several 
hundred street people enjoyed a counter inaugural banquet of hot 
chili and rice tortilla chips salad and apple cider on the plaza 
in front of union station 
while they ate off of paper plates the homeless listened to 
guitar players and watched a proabortion street theater featuring a 
man in tennis shoes wearing a bush mask and a sign reading i 
oppose abortion hanging around his neck 
protesters organized by a group called the counterinaugural 
coalition for a peoples agenda carried placards reading food 
not bombs george knew and the skies are for stars not 
war another sign under a huge peace symbol read now appearing 
in a fouryear show son of reaganstein costarring big bird 
bush and quayle were guests of honor at the lavish dinners 
attended by more than 2500 republican stalwarts and fatcat 
contributors the blacktie crowd was so large the dinners were held 
at union station and the nearby pension building and corcoran 
gallery of art 
for 1500 ticket each invited guest was to hear brief remarks 
by bush and quayle at the three dinner sites and feast on a 
fourcourse dinner 
outside of union station park police sgt robert kass banished a 
half dozen conservative republican counterdemonstrators for lack of 
a permit 
the leader of the group eugene delgaudio 34 executive director 
of the private ultraconservative activists group known as public 
advocate said he wanted to show theres a better way than 
openly political negativism he said his demonstrators were to 
welcome the blacktie dinner guests with american flags and signs 
reading welcome nonliberals 
several homeless people paused between spoonfuls of chili to say 
that the 225 million in proceeds from the inaugural dinners should 
be spent to provide food additional shelters job training and 
subsidized public transportation for washingtons street people 
referring to the inaugural diners roosevelt carrington a 
30yearold homeless person said i think maybe they should eat 
the same thing were having so theyll know what its like 
said ronnie thompson 38 they done robbed most of it from 
us he said the inaugural dinner proceeds should be used for the 
homeless because a lot of them have given up 
more than 1000 people were served at the counterinaugural 
dinner at union station 
as guests began arriving shortly before 7 pm several hundred 
of the people at the counterinaugural banquet began shouting 
what about the homeless and 50000 dead from aids where was 
george 
although the park police allowed the demonstration to spread 
closer to the train depot than the demonstrators permit allowed 
the protestors remained 100 yards from the entrance where the 
invited guests were emerging from their cars and were barely audible 
from that distance 
at about 730 pm one half hour before the union station 
banquet would get officially underway the park police received 
reinforcement and barricades which were set up in front of the 
demonstrators 
park police sgt g f wallace asked whether the barricades had 
been planned in advance said im not in on these decisions but 
i imagine it was spontaneous because of the crowds activitywe 
cant have the police spread out or people can sneak through we 
should have had them up there before 
there was no indication that any of the invited guests to the 
union station dinner were even aware of the demonstration none of 
them came over to see what is going on 
at the majestic corcoran gallery of art dinner guests who also 
paid 1500 each were serenaded up a royal blue carpeted stairway by 
violins playing this could be the start of something big 
elegantly attired guests wandered through art displays ranging 
from modern neon art to traditional american pieces the gallery was 
hung with blue bunting with white stars and large arrangements of 
red roses decorated the corridors 
among the guests at the corcoran gala dinner were bushs longtime 
friend and commerce secretarydesignate robert mosbacher of texas 
and mosbachers socialite wife georgette mrs mosbacher like mrs 
bush and mrs quayle was dressed in a blackandwhite gown 
also among the guests were sen john warner rva and bushs 
son marvin and his wife margaret the younger bush said he was 
having fun but mostly waiting for fridays swearing in of his 
father 
the rest will be fun he said adding however the one we 
will all be looking forward to will be friday an incredibly proud 
moment for all of us 
his wife who wore a fitted strapless black gown with a brocade 
bodice said she had never seen george and barbara bush so excited 
as they have been with the inauguration approaching theyre like 
two kids she said

once a little city with clean if rainy skies and 
clear mountain views fastgrowing seattle has become a metropolis 
with the usual smog and traffic jams some people are starting to 
protest 
a citizens group turned in 18000 signatures on an initiative to 
limit the height and density of downtown buildings and debate is 
gearing up before a vote this spring 
the building boom is easy to see and much of it has occurred in 
the past decade three skyscrapers are under construction and 
permit applications for three more were submitted before a recently 
imposed sixmonth moratorium on downtown growth 
the 55story washington mutual tower was completed last year 
bumping the 50story 1001 fourth avenue plaza to third tallest no 
1 is the west coasts tallest building the 76story blackglass 
columbia seafirst center built in 1985 before downtown zoning went 
into effect a dozen office towers are 30 stories or more and all 
but three were opened in the 1980s 
the thousands of workers in these buildings plus tourists and 
shoppers make downtown seattle a lively place 
fishmongers farmers stalls crafts booths and restaurants 
compete shouldertoshoulder at the historic hectic pike place 
market 
redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront and the 
downtown retail core with major flagship department stores and a 
variety of small businesses recently settled one 30yearold 
landuse debate with the opening of westlake center a new mall of 
expensive shops and a 24story office tower 
supporters of the citizens alternative plan to downtown 
development or cap say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more 
pollution as more people commute by car and more boxlike apartment 
buildings replace singlefamily houses and dilute the flavor of old 
city neighborhoods 
cap wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the 
office district new office floor space would be limited to 500000 
square feet a year for the next five years and 1 million square feet 
a year from 1995 through 1999 after that the ceiling would be 
lifted unless reimposed by the city council 
by contrast nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office 
space is newly completed under construction or has received city 
permits said virginia galle a city council member and cap 
supporter 
at the present rate of growth in 10 years some 67000 new office 
workers are expected to occupy 52000 new households and make 29000 
more car trips daily into downtown she said 
there is no height limit under the citys current zoning plan a 
buildings size is worked out according to a formula based on the 
size of the site with extra height allowed in exchange for such 
amenities as plazas retail space and day care centers 
cap supporters insist they want growth but not at a high cost to 
the environment and the neighborhoods 
were not antigrowth in the traditional sense says patrick 
strosahl a jeweler and president of vision seattle which supports 
cap were really much more into shaping growth so that it 
produces and accentuates the livability of the city 
some participants in the growth debate argue the city needs 
controls that are more lenient than the cap initiative 
mayor charles royer presented a plan of his own that would limit 
office towers to about 50 stories it would stiffen the zoning code 
but not as much as cap would 
royer also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow 
developers to build higher his plan would shift the emphasis of the 
bonuses from streetlevel amenities to housing human services and 
open space 
the downtown seattle association a group of developers and 
business executives contends the 1985 zoning law is strict enough 
john gilmore president of the association says downtown growth 
makes more sense than spreading development into neighborhods and 
suburbs a downtown provides a focal point for a rapidtransit 
system something seattle needs he said and seattle must grow he 
contended were having childen like every other part of the 
country and theres got to be jobs 
folke nyberg a professor of urban planning and architecture at 
the university of washington agreed seattles location on the 
pacific rim means it will grow but disagreed that concentrated 
downtown growth is good 
seattle has an hourglass figure squeezed between puget 
sound and lake washington he said so there are some very limited 
physical constraints that makes it imperative that we have an 
effective transportation solution before we allow growth to happen 
and this was not done 
a better way to grow nyberg said would be in decentralized 
clusters throughout the region people in these smaller cities would 
live near their jobs and go to downtown seattle mainly for 
conventions and cultural events 
instead unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality 
traffic congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of 
afforable housing he said 
seattle which has been a very livable city he said failed 
to learn from other cities mistakes asked why he replied its 
all greed 
the growthcontrol initiative goes before voters may 16 the city 
council decided last week 
gilmore of the downtown seattle association said that the 
citys 1985 downtown zoning was the product of four years of debate 
and that any changes should be made through more hearings and city 
council votes the american institute of architects local chapter 
agrees 
cap supporters however say their plan is reasonable and timely 
according to strosahl san francisco needed to enact stiffer 
downtown limits in 1986 because it waited too long until the cost 
of housing went way up and the character of the city changed 
san francisco voters approved the limits after a building spree 
in which 25 million square feet of office space was added between 
1979 and 1984 the high rises nearly blocked out all the sun in san 
franciscos financial district 
san franciscos voterapproved plan limits new office space to 
475000 square feet for several years for a city with a population 
of 690000 that compares with caps limits of 500000 square feet 
for five years and 1 million square feet for the next five in a city 
of 490000 
gilmore suggests people who signed cap did not really want to 
limit growth but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown 
caused by construction of a downtown bus tunnel and a state 
convention center the initiative text was long and complicated and 
people probably did not read it he said 
whats more the petition had just 329 more signatures than it 
needed 
strosahl thinks voters will pass the initiative but he expects a 
highly financed campaign against it

the sinking new years eve of an 
overcrowded tourist boat off rio de janeiro has sparked a nationwide 
outcry against what many brazilians feel is the impunity of the rich 
and powerful and a general disrespect for law 
in public demonstrations brazilians have made the tragedy in 
which 52 passengers and crew died a forum to rail against a 
widespread sense that in brazil people in the right places can get 
away with lawbreaking from running red lights to hiring 
professional killers 
some of the worst vices of the brazilian soul came to light the 
moment the boat sank facility to bribe irresponsibility and the 
failure to assist fellow citizens in trouble the newspaper jornal 
do brasil of rio de janeiro said in an editorial 
there has been no accurate count of the number of revelers on the 
bateau mouche when it capsized and sank on its way to an annual 
fireworks display off copacabana beach a widely accepted figure is 
150 
the flatbottomed river boat was built to carry 20 passengers 
survivors claim it was dangerously overcrowded and listing badly in 
rough water and that lifejackets were not readily accessible 
there are accusations as yet unproved that port authority 
guards who inspected the bateau mouche just two hours before it went 
down were paid off to allow it to venture into the open sea 
the navy and the police are bickering over which group should 
investigate the sinking there is widespread fear that no one will 
be held responsible as happened so often before here in latin 
americas largest country in highway and maritime tragedies fires 
and collapses of buildings and freeways 
in 1981 for example two riverboat sinkings in amazon waters 
claimed about 500 lives both resulted from overcrowding yet no one 
was ever prosecuted 
the sinking of the bateau mouche is a portrait of our 
reality political commentator alexandre garcia said in a 
syndicated newspaper column we were already irresponsible now we 
are becoming inhuman 
there is a cultural tradition of disregarding security norms 
of negligence said evaristo de moraes a lawyer for the owners of 
the bateau mouche we need to look at our mentality which 
believes that laws are always flexible 
de moraes added however that in the case of the boat disaster 
i am convinced my clients had no responsibility whatsoever 
indeed one of the owners of the boat initially told reporters 
that panic among the passengers was the cause of the tragedy 
paulo soares a soninlaw of the bateau mouches 50yearold 
captain camilo da costa who drowned told the ap camilo didnt 
want to go out he called us to say the boat was overloaded and the 
sea was too rough but he had no choice he would lose his job if he 
didnt sail 
brazilians are proud of what they call jeitinho or a 
little way of cutting through red tape avoiding a traffic 
ticket or eliminating a problem that has become intertwined with 
selfdefinitions of national character there is a whole 
professional category known as despachantes whose job consists 
basically of paying off the right people 
a recent primetime tv soap opera vale tudo anything goes 
drew ratings of 80 percent with its portrayals of greed conniving 
corruption and deceit among it principal characters 
but it isnt exclusively a lack of respect for laws that has 
generated a sense of impunity in brazil said deputy justice 
minister luis eichenberg 
this also has grown from a tremendous lack of human and 
material resources he said we often are physically and 
financially unable to enforce the law 
many brazilians are determined that the bateau mouche case not be 
forgotten theater and movie personalities outraged by the 
drowning of the wellknown actress yara amaral along with rio city 
councilmen and other well known figures have organized to demand 
that police determine responsibility in the sinking 
brazilians also have rallied around the shooting death in 
december of the internationally known ecologist francisco mendes 
who sought to defend the amazons ecology and its poor peasants 
against the interests of powerful landowners many employ private 
gunmen to eliminate enemies 
according to amnesty international the londonbased human rights 
organization about 1000 peasants ecologists and roman catholic 
priests who defend landless farmers have been killed in land 
disputes in brazil since 1980 only three cases have been 
prosecuted the organization says

president reagan returns to his beloved 
california as the toast of hollywood reinvigorating the social 
scene with the stature of a popular twoterm president who never 
forgot his show business past 
ronald and nancy reagan dont hide their eagerness to step out of 
the national spotlight and reenter a private world among friends 
the president has said every time i come home i say to myself 
why did i ever leave 
their affluent friends are no less eager 
its tough to beat a former president living in your midst 
they are now going to be the superstars in the belair circuit 
entertainment industry observer army archerd said 
hollywood feels it sent one of its own to the white house and 
now hes returned as the most popular president in history hes one 
of us said tv producer gregory willenborg 
merv griffin and barron hilton set the social tone by throwing a 
25000atable homecoming gala earlier this month 
the reagans will be a star attraction feb 23 at the americas 
hope award presentations honoring elizabeth taylor and a valentines 
day party is on tap for mrs reagan 
they will really reinvigorate things dance man donald 
oconnor predicted griffin said the social calendar is already 
topsyturvy im sure they will be the leaders of everything that 
happens here he said 
reagan never forgot hollywood where he starred in motion 
pictures and led the screen actors guild throughout his eight years 
in the white house he delighted in spinning show business yarns 
there are those who hope reagans fondness for his old vocation 
will lead him back to the screen actress joan collins said a script 
has been written for reagan to play her exhusband on dynasty if 
he chooses and griffin suggested the reagans might make a movie 
together 
but one longtime reagan friend said television and movies arent 
part of the reagan postpresidential agenda 
i think the idea of him being interested in an acting career is 
absurd said the reagan confidant who spoke on condition that his 
name be withheld i dont think he will do anything in 
entertainment 
however the same source said the nation may hear reagan on 
saturday morning radio again expressing his thoughts and opinions 
on issues facing the country 
reagan expects to be inundated with requests to make speeches on 
the mashedpotato circuit and has offered himself up as a foot 
soldier in what he calls the bush brigade of his successors 
supporters 
he and mrs reagan also have plans to write memoirs and push 
their pet causes 
not everyone is happy the reagans are back in town residents of 
lake view terrace 20 miles north of los angeles have been fighting 
to keep the nancy reagan center for drug rehabilitation out of their 
neighborhood 
homeowners fear the center an extension of mrs reagans just 
say no antidrug crusade will bring addicts into the area and 
endanger residents during the recent beverly hills welcomehome 
gala which raised 1 million for the center residents marched 
outside with signs reading if you really care put it in 
belair 
that affluent hillside enclave is the reagans new neighborhood 
although they are keeping their santa barbara ranch as a retreat 
they intend to spend most of their time in their new 25 million 
belair home 
perched in hills among 10 millionplus mansions the 
6500squarefoot ranchstyle home is modest by neighborhood 
standards 
little can be seen behind an electronic iron gate leading to 668 
saint cloud rd a guard shack was constructed recently a chain link 
fence was thrown up over vintage stone walls and roofmounted 
cameras scan the property 
the address was changed last summer from 666 saint cloud because 
of connotations surrounding the number 666 believed by some to be 
the symbol of the devil 
tourists clutching 5 maps to stars homes ply the winding roads 
aboard tour vans or in rental cars so far little notice has been 
paid to the reagan house the real stars are the beverly 
hillbillies mansion and the home of entertainer zsa zsa gabor

people who throw parties that get 
out of hand could find themselves in trouble with more than the 
neighbors 
a bill that got its first reading tuesday by south lake tahoe 
city council would let the city bill people for the police time 
involved if somebody calls the police to the same address twice 
the measure would let the partythrower be charged up to 500 
council member neva roberts voiced the only opposition to the 
measure saying the city already has laws to deal with disturbing 
the peace and adding that she thinks there are people who will 
complain even when a party isnt loud enough to warrant it 
besides she asked what fun is a party with no noise anyway 
the ordinance is scheduled for a second reading feb 7 if 
approved then it will become law 30 days later

the oklahoma supreme court on tuesday 
reversed a 390000 judgment won by a woman who was publicly branded 
by her church for having sex outside of marriage 
but the court left open the possibility that the woman could 
recover damages for actions taken by church elders after she sought 
to withdraw from membership in the church 
the oklahoma court ruled marian guinn could not recover for any 
civil wrongs committed against her by church elders while she was 
still a member of the collinsville church of christ 
justice marian opala wrote the majority opinion sending the case 
back for a new trial four other justices concurred two dissented 
and two others dissented in part 
opalas opinion held that the first amendment did not protect 
church elders from potential liability for acts that occurred after 
the woman withdrew her church membership 
the decision said it could be found that the elders went beyond 
the bounds of decency by going against the womans wishes and 
announcing to the congregation the womans sin of fornication 
when she declined to publicly repent 
we hence hold there is competent evidence to support the jurys 
conclusion that the elders had intended to inflict emotional harm on 
parishioner the opinion said 
elders of the collinsville church located north of tulsa in 
northeast oklahoma filed the appeal after a tulsa county jury in 
march 1984 awarded ms guinn 205000 actual damages and 185000 
punitive damages 
the registered nurse and divorced mother of four sued in 1981 
when elders of the church disclosed she had committed the sin of 
fornication 
the church argued elders had a right outlined in the bible to 
discipline members 
the elders were identified in the supreme court ruling as ron 
whitten ted moody and allen cash 
the court said the woman had implored the elders in a letter not 
to mention her name in church except to say she had withdrawn from 
membership 
the elders told the woman that withdrawing from the church was 
not possible and could not halt disciplinary action against her

looting and vandalism spread tuesday and eight 
people were shot one fatally in the second day of rioting sparked 
by the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a white 
policeman 
schools were closed a professional basketball game was canceled 
and some fans were stranded in the arena snipers fired at police 
who cordoned off a 130block area of the predominantly black 
overtown neighborhood 
after nightfall authorities told lawabiding citizens to remain 
indoors and began a blockbyblok sweep 
for the sake of our city i appeal to every citizen regardless 
of race to stay calm get off the streets and stay in your homes 
said miami mayor xavier suarez in a televised appeal tuesday night 
we are arresting people and we are being a lot more aggressive 
in the enforcement of the law and i think we have to be suarez 
added i dont think this will continue after today 
authorities said overtown just north of downtown was largely 
quiet after police entered by 1130 pm about 150 people had been 
arrested mostly for looting 
but the violence already had spread to liberty city a separate 
black community several miles to the northwest where looting and 
gunfire continued tuesday night 
police said they made an arrest in the fatal shooting of a young 
black man in liberty city at 1020 pm but hadnt determined if it 
was related to the rioting 
officer eric butler wearing a bulletproof vest was shot in the 
vest at 930 pm by a sniper who was later arrested on top of a 
threestory building butler was not seriously injured 
plans were made for up to 500 national guard troops to be 
mobilized within two hours if the violence continued said brian 
ballard a spokesman for gov bob martinez 
top police officials said the tough stance would not bring a 
violent reaction because only a few people were violating the law 
trouble erupted again tuesday afternoon when a white man in a 
luxury car reportedly fired into a crowd of blacks in the area 
wounding one person before driving away 
all i know is that one person was hit in the side police 
spokesman angelo bitsis said adding that the unidentified victim 
was hospitalized in fair condition 
sporadic gunfire continued throughout the day police said 
officers rescued one shooting victim while under fire returned fire 
at another man injuring him in the leg and shot an alleged sniper 
in the leg 
another man was shot in the thigh in a gun battle between two men 
in a store and a gang of looters later a man with a bullet wound 
in his leg was arrested when he showed up at a hospital for 
treatment an eighth person was shot in the leg in liberty city 
about 25 youths shattered car windows outside the miami arena on 
the border of overtown where the national basketball associations 
miami heat was scheduled to play the phoenix suns tuesday night the 
game was canceled 
a meat truck was looted and one white motorist was beaten after 
his car broke down in overtown 
the car of associated press photographer mark pesetsky was burned 
and he was roughed up by a mob but not seriously hurt when he 
attempted to take pictures of the crowd that had gathered near the 
site of tuesdays shooting 
police fired tear gas at the crowd and in turn were pelted by 
rocks and bottles they then sealed off a several block area and 
shots could be heard from within 
i saw someone coming around a building and throwing rocks and 
i said lets go get out of here pesetsky said at least one 
car also was burned in liberty city 
the fbi announced that it would open an investigation into monday 
nights shooting to determine whether there were civil rights 
violations miami bureau spokesman george kiszynski said 
i cant tell you how long it will take but it will be an 
extensive and thorough investigation and it will be done as promptly 
as possible kiszynski said 
meanwhile a passenger on the motorcycle who was injured when the 
driver crashed into a car after the shooting died tuesday at jackson 
memorial hospital of massive head injuries spokeswoman betty 
baderman said 
suarez one of the targets of rock and bottle throwing monday 
night spent tuesday meeting with black leaders and residents of 
overtown a neighborhood of rundown lowslung apartment buildings 
and trashstrewn vacant lots just north of downtown miami 
people are angry people want a full explanation of what 
happened said suarez who also expressed particular concern about 
the damage to miamis image less than a week before the city is host 
to the super bowl 
at least two buildings and three cars were burned in the rioting 
which broke out about two hours after a white police officer shot 
and killed a black motorcyclist being chased for a traffic 
infraction no damage estimates were available 
authorities said seven civilians and three of the 280 police 
officers called to the scene were injured 
police guarded a 130block area of overtown on tuesday warning 
motorists who passed through that they could not be guaranteed 
protection six schools were closed and some buses were rerouted 
but authorities refused to declare an evening curfew 
the disturbance recalled the bloody 1980 riot in adjacent liberty 
city that also was linked to the death of a black motorcyclist at 
the hands of white officers a similar disturbance broke out in 1982 
when a black man was shot to death only a few blocks from where the 
latest incident began 
on monday clement lloyd 23 died following a police chase that 
started just after 6 pm 
bitsis said lloyd and a passenger on his motorcycle sped past a 
police officer who gave chase then the motorcycle headed down a 
street where another officer william lozano was taking a report 
from a crime victim 
he heard the radio transmission and saw the motorcycle coming 
in his direction bitsis said as the motorcycle either 
approached him or went by him he fired his shot 
the bullet hit lloyd in the head killing him and the motorcycle 
then crashed into a car allen blanchard 24 a passenger on the 
motorcycle died tuesday 
by 8 pm an angry crowd had surrounded the police and news media 
vehicles gathered at the spot and the violence began with rocks 
and bottles thrown at police reporters and their cars 
crowds of up to 100 people roamed the streets smashing 
windshields burning vehicles looting some stores and occasionally 
firing weapons at police 
lozano 29 a fouryear veteran of the force was automatically 
suspended with pay pending an investigation into whether he used 
excessive force 
many in miamis black community said they were tired of police 
violence saying nothing has changed despite promises by suarez and 
other officials who courted black votes 
suarez strongly denied that the attention paid to newly arriving 
nicaraguan refugees had created illwill in the black community but 
black leaders did not agree 
in this tremendous influx of refugees from central and south 
america the africanamericans have felt cheated we felt we were 
losing our place in the city said johnnie mcmillian president of 
the miamidade branch of the naacp 
the scene of mondays disturbance was about 15 miles from joe 
robbie stadium site of the super bowl 
but the cincinnati bengals are staying less than a mile away at 
the omni hotel

a semiautomatic rifle such as the ak47 that 
was used in the stockton calif school shootings tuesday can be 
easily purchased at oregon gun stores without even the waiting 
period required to buy a handgun 
the gunman identified by police as patrick purdy had bought the 
rifle from the sandy trading post on aug 3 according to sandy 
police chief fred punzel authorities say purdy opened fire in an 
elementary school yard killing five youngsters and wounding 30 
people before killing himself 
bob imel owner of paws gun shop in salem said there is no 
waiting period under oregon law to buy rifles or shotguns unless 
they are fully automatic there is a fiveday wait to buy a handgun 
while police agencies check for criminal records 
a buyer is required to sign a form issued by the us bureau of 
alcohol tobacco and firearms the form requires the buyer to 
provide identification and attest that he is not under indictment 
has not been convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year in 
prison and is not a fugitive from justice 
a buyer also must attest that he is not an unlawful user of 
narcotics has not been found mentally defective or been committed 
to a mental instutition has not been discharged dishonorably from 
the armed forces is not an illegal alien and has not renounced us 
citizenship 
people must be at least 18 to purchase rifles and shotguns and 21 
to buy handguns there are some other requirements including that a 
prospective buyer not have been adjudged mentally ill or be an 
exconvict imel said 
purchases of automatic weapons are more complicated he said 
because federal law requires extensive background checks and 
registration of the weapons the procedure usually takes several 
months before a buyer can receive the gun imel said 
in california anyone can purchase a semiautomatic weapon by 
completing a form and showing a drivers license or other proof of 
residency in the state 
california deputy attorney general alan ashby said that even in 
legal semiautomatic condition an ak47 can fire at a rate of 400 
rounds per minute and that conversion to automatic firing while 
illegal is relatively easy on many semiautomatic models 
sales of the sovietdesigned ak47s have become intensely 
controversial in california because of their use by the increasingly 
violent street gangs in los angeles and other communities 
in the los angeles area models of the ak47 that have been 
manufactured in china sell from 299 to 329 at sporting goods 
stores and are often advertised on sale

yet while the bushites arent exactly storming the gates its a 
traumatic time for many 
as ronald reagan flies off into the sunset he leaves behind many 
loyal workers who wonder why they are suddenly out while others 
stay on the answer of course is that people work hard in a 
campaign and the jobs that serve as rewards are in great demand 
we had our turn now its their turn says ms arsht who 
came from the commerce department two years ago with marlin 
fitzwater when he became reagans spokesman she has been deputy 
press secretary a job that will go to bush spokesman steve hart 
im a texan a lifetime supporter of george bush she says 
its a bittersweet time 
outside her door in the white house press office is a huge box 
being filled with files for the national archives the work of the 
press office goes on but its obvious that things are being readied 
for the big change 
on friday the rooms will be mostly empty the cupboards bare 
the walls nude it wont be as stark as say when jimmy carter left 
town eight years ago because fitzwater will stay on to serve bush 
as chief spokesman 
in one part of the office a cardboard box is marked do not 
throw away this is not trash in the hallway a photo gallery 
that has been dominated by pictures of ron and nancy reagan has 
undergone a subtle turn the pictures of the reagans have been 
augmented by photos of reagan and bush 
one of those who is leaving is connie gerrard the closest thing 
the white house has to an institutional memory ms gerrard came 
into the white house 25 years ago with lyndon johnson as a 
freshfromcollege secretary after the assassination of john f 
kennedy 
she has stayed serving as the press secretarys secretary 
through nixon carter ford and reagan and she is ready to live a 
life without the endless workdays and the constant crises 
i now want to be able to control my own schedule she says 
she knows what the incoming bush staffers will soon learn that in 
the press office you have to hit the ground running there is 
nothing to prepare you for what you find when you get here 
indeed reporters were pressing fitzwater on tuesday about where 
they will get information after noon on friday fitzwater and b jay 
cooper will be the only veteran hands remaining in the bush 
administration 
the rest of the press office staff will come from the bush team 
many of them will see the inside of the office for the first time 
when they come to work on inauguration day 
its a matter of sensitivity cooper says nobody wants to 
have the new person watching over their shoulder 
many of the people leaving spent the weekend packing their own 
belongings reagan too was seen by fitzwater last week putting 
some things into a box 
the president and first lady have been packing for some time 
fitzwater said they have shipped most of their private goods to 
california already

private exporters have new orders for 530000 
metric tons of us wheat from the soviet union and 200000 metric 
tons from the chinese under the agriculture department program that 
lets them buy grain at cutrate prices 
the wheat sold to the soviet union by private exporters was part 
of 2 million tons authorized dec 23 under the departments export 
enhancement program or eep melvin e sims general sales manager 
for the departments foreign agricultural service said tuesday 
the wheat was bought under a longterm supply agreement with the 
united states now in its sixth year 
sims said the wheat is for shipment in january february and 
march counting some wheat left over from previous eep arrangements 
the soviets have 670200 tons still available under the program 
the chinese however have used almost all of their current 
subsidy authorization in the past each country has had new 
authorizations set by usda after exhausting what was available 
the soviet union bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under 
eep arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement the 
pact expired last sept 30 but was later extended through dec 31 
1990 
the eep arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other 
designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in 
order to meet foreign competition the exporters then collect free 
government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses or 
subsidies 
last year us corn sales to the soviet union totaled slightly 
less than 52 million tons wheat sales in 198788 all subsidized 
totaled slightly more than 9 million tons 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 394 bushels 
of corn or 367 bushels of wheat or soybeans the 530000 tons of 
wheat would be about 195 million bushels 
wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than 4 per 
bushel according to recent usda market figures making the new sale 
worth an estimated 78 million 
besides the wheat for 198889 delivery under the pact the 
soviets have ordered 102 million tons of corn 450000 tons of 
soybeans and 1132500 tons of soybean meal plus 500000 tons of 
grain sorghum only the wheat is subsidized 
sims said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of 
2335 per ton or about 64 cents per bushel he said the bonuses on 
the 530000 tons of wheat will be paid to eight companies cargill 
inc 80000 tons continental grain co 200000 garnac grain co 
50000 richco grain ltd 50000 tradigrain inc 50000 
mitsubishi international corp 25000 louis dreyfus corp 25000 
and bunge corp 50000 
in the case of the 200000 tons sold to china sims said the 
wheat was part of 1 million tons authorized dec 30 for china 
the wheat sales were handled by two companies cargill inc 
115000 tons and louis dreyfus corp 85000 tons 
sims said the wheat was sold for march shipment and will carry an 
average subsidy rate of 2249 per ton or about 62 cents per bushel 
only 10000 tons remain available to china under the program he 
said

the agriculture department says that for the 
first time it will reserve some of its summer jobs for students from 
17 historically black universities 
deputy secretary peter c myers said tuesday that 563 of the 1989 
summer jobs will be held aside as part of the departments effort 
to increase the number of minority students in agriculture 
forestry and home economics 
last year 17753 students nationwide worked during the summer 
months for various usda agencies and officials said they expect 
about that many this year the 563 jobs reserved for the black 
schools would represent about 3 percent of the total 
agriculture is more than crop and livestock production myers 
said animal and plant sciences economics forestry marketing 
and computer technology are just some of the varied career fields in 
agriculture today 
myers said the jobs will be with 19 usda agencies and will be 
located nationwide he said interested students at 17 institutions 
should contact university placement offices before march 1 
the universities collectively known as 1890 institutions because 
of landgrant legislation that year are being targeted in other 
ways by usda myers said 
on dec 29 the department announced it is establishing offices 
at each of the 17 schools to help encourage more minorities in 
agriculture also on jan 9 the proposed usda budget for next year 
included 802 million for new and expanded programs to increase the 
teaching recruitment and research capabilities at the 1890 schools 
a 20 percent increase from the current level 
the 17 schools are 
alabama aampm huntsville

the moiseyev dance company visiting america for 
the eighth time since 1958 proves it can still surprise 
dancing briskly with their knees bent in an impossible squat 
vaulting high in the air these soviet dancers are astonishingly 
athletic and virtuosic and they look like theyre really having 
fun the audience picks up on that and has fun too 
the company opened at radio city music hall for 14 performances 
on tuesday they look splendid on that tall wide stage 
there are old favorites on the bill but igor moiseyev 83 who 
founded the company in 1937 has choreographed some new things as 
well this is good for viewers whove seen the company before 
partisans in which dancers in long cloaks glide as though on 
rollers then break into horselike gaits will always look 
remarkable no matter how often seen 
a new one on this tour is aragonnaise jota based on spanish 
dance its brief and beautiful the men in white and black the 
women in white blouses red skirts and black lace aprons another 
new one to america is malamba which moiseyev built using 
argentine dances 
also on tuesdays program was polovtsian dances from 1974 
set to borodin music known here primarily from kismet the khan 
reviews his warriors and captive women the women are in harem dress 
and moiseyev has managed to make their dancing exotic and not at all 
sexy its a long dance with a string of solos and small dances for 
various ensembles it would be too lavish for a classical ballet but 
in this gravitydefying style it seemed an admirable production 
number 
farcical timing is all in sanchakou in which two chinese men 
have a swordfight in the dark at the beginning when one puts out 
his candle the spotlight gets smaller it gives the illusion 
theyre in the dark but lets the audience see every near slice 
the tour began last week in stamford conn and went to boston 
before coming to new york from jan 31 through march 20 the 
moiseyev will perform in washington dc chicago clearwater 
fla miami beach los angeles cupertino calif and san francisco

a wheat supply crunch in the united states and 
canada is helping the 12nation european economic community export 
surplus grain at record levels and fat prices according to 
agriculture department analysts 
the departments foreign agricultural service said tuesday that 
limited southern hemisphere exportable supplies of wheat 
coupled with a tight inventory in north america is behind the surge 
in eec exports 
according to the agencys report the eec will export a record 19 
million metric tons of wheat in the international trading year that 
runs through june up from 153 million tons in 198788 
meanwhile us wheat exports were projected at 409 million 
tons down from 434 million tons in 198788 canadas exports were 
shown at 117 million tons down from 236 million last year 
australia and argentina also showed declines 
a metric ton is about 2205 pounds and is equal to 367 bushels 
of wheat 
it said the 1989 us winter wheat crop for harvest this coming 
summer will be the first newcrop supplies available for export 
and given the nature of the world wheat market the size and 
quality of this crop will likely set the stage for prices in 
198990 
the usda reported last week that american farmers had boosted 
plantings of winter wheat for this years harvest by 12 percent 
however much of the newly planted crop is in need of moisture 
wheat prices continue to strengthen and have reached their 
highest level since january 1982 amid a flurry of recent purchases 
and early concerns about the north america wheat crop the report 
said 
the global wheat stockpile by this summer is expected to shrink 
to 1153 million tons from 1456 million tons a year ago the report 
said foreign supplies were projected at 1008 million tons 
compared with 145 million tons in the united states 
last summer the us share of the wheat inventory was 343 
million tons and the remainder of the world 1113 million tons

once again democrats are out in the cold on 
inauguration day spectators as a republican takes office as 
president but like george bush the democrats are developing a 
special fondness for martin van buren 
in his first news conference as presidentelect bush expressed 
his gratitude to president reagan and then said i also want to 
thank martin van buren for paving the way its been a long time 
marty 
not since van burens election in 1836 had an incumbent vice 
president succeeded in winning the white house 
but the democrats like the second half of the van buren story he 
was a oneterm president defeated when he ran for reelection in 
1840 
as usual there is a bumper crop of politicians hoping to be the 
star at a democratic celebration next inauguration day 
start with familiar names from the 1988 campaign michael 
dukakis jesse jackson lloyd bentsen albert gore jr richard 
gephardt all are regarded as likely contenders when the 1992 
campaign gets rolling 
sens bill bradley of new jersey and sam nunn of georgia refused 
to run in 1988 but may not be so reticent the next time around the 
same goes for gov bill clinton of arkansas 
gov mario cuomo of new york is a name sure to come up in 
connection with 1992 and would the early stages of presidential 
speculation be complete without mention of sen edward m kennedy 
what about a woman rep pat schroeder of colorado was tempted to 
join the 1988 field but decided against it she has a book coming 
out in february and plans to do a lot of traveling to promote it 
long shots the senate is filled with them sen george mitchell 
of maine was no sooner elected majority leader than whispers began 
suggesting hed be an impressive presidential candidate newly 
elected sen bob kerrey of nebraska also was being mentioned even 
before moving to washington the same was true of sen charles robb 
of virginia 
and somewhere out there in america is a senator congressman 
governor or businessman whose name will come up a year or two from 
now touted as the candidate who could break the republican hold on 
the white house 
trips to iowa site of the first democratic presidential 
caucuses are a good sign of whether a politician has white house 
fever 
former professional basketball star bradley made a guest 
appearance early this year at a college basketball tournament in 
iowa 
its a good bet that democratic legislative candidates in iowa 
will have all the bigname help they want in the 1990 campaign 
several of the most prominent prospects for 1992 have reelection 
campaigns in 1990 they include bradley gore nunn cuomo clinton 
gephardt and schroeder 
dukakis the defeated 1988 presidential nominee recently 
announced he would not seek another term as governor of 
massachusetts in 1990 a decision he said has nothing to do with 
national office 
but dukakis also said one of the lessons he had learned in 1988 
was that it is very difficult to run for the presidency as an 
incumbent governor 
texas sen bentsen impressed many voters with his performance as 
the democratic vice presidential nominee and that seems likely to 
merit him mention for 1992 but bentsen will turn 71 on feb 11 
1992

william henry harrison the ninth president of 
the united states pledged in his inaugural address not to run for a 
second term he died a month later from pneumonia probably 
contracted while delivering that address on a bitterly cold day 
harrisons speech was notable not only for its norepeat promise 
but also because it was the longest on record it is not remembered 
for its rhetoric which included this sentence the spirit of 
liberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our 
institutions may receive 
most presidents however have reserved their finest 
phrasemaking for their inauguration speech abraham lincoln 
exhorted his countrymen when he was sworn for the second term to 
act with malice toward none with charity for all franklin d 
roosevelt told depressionplagued americans that the only thing we 
have to fear is fear itself harry truman proclaimed i say to 
all men what we have achieved in liberty we will surpass in 
greater liberty 
thomas jefferson the most gifted writer of all 40 presidents 
enunciated a basic tenet of democracy absolute acquiescence in 
the will of the majority 
the tradition of invoking a higher power dates back to george 
washington who added so help me god to his oath and kissed the 
bible in the day of the father of our country the inaugural 
ceremony was indoors it was moved outside in 1817 by james monroe 
the best remembered inaugural speech for its eloquence is john 
f kennedys in 1961 
let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and 
foe alike that the torch has been passed to a new generation of 
americans born in this century tempered by war disciplined by a 
hard and bitter peace proud of our ancient heritage he said 
let every nation know whether it wishes us well or ill that 
we shall pay any price bear any burden meet any hardship support 
any friend oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of 
liberty 
and ask not what america will do for you ask what you can do 
for your country 
his successor lyndon b johnson said in his 1965 inaugural 
address that americas heritage must be relearned in each 
generation if we fail now then we will have forgotten in 
abundance what we learned in hardship that democracy rests on 
faith that freedom asks more than it gives and the judgment of god 
is harshest on those who are most favored 
richard nixon said in 1969 that what has to be done has to be 
done by government and people together or it will not be done at 
all the lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do 
nothing with the people we can do everything 
gerald ford never elected had no opportunity to deliver an 
inaugural address but he was at his most eloquent at his 
swearingin after nixon resigned our long national nightmare is 
over our constitution works our great republic is a government of 
laws and not men here the people rule 
in his turn in 1977 jimmy carter began his tenure with praise 
for ford for myself and for our nation i want to thank my 
predecessor for all he has done to heal our land carter said he 
told his fellow citizens that the bold and brilliant dream which 
excited the founders of this nation still awaits its consummation i 
have no new dream to set forth today but rather urge a fresh faith 
in the old dream 
ronald reagan launched his eight years in the white house with a 
refrain from his campaign government is not the solution to our 
problem government is the problem and it is not my intention 
to do away with government it is rather to make it work work with 
us not over us to stand by our side not ride on our back

a supreme court ruling over a california 
redistricting plan shows the court may be unwilling to restrain 
state legislatures from hightech gerrymandering that gives one 
political party a big edge when drawing congressional district lines 
the high courts ruling comes at a time when state legislatures 
are anticipating redrawing congressional district lines once the 
1990 census is completed 
the justices by a vote of 63 ruled tuesday the constitutional 
rights of republicans were not violated by a california 
redistricting plan that gave democrats solid control of the states 
congressional delegation 
the court upheld the plan in a onesentence ruling sustaining a 
lower court decision that republicans did not suffer unlawful 
discrimination 
republicans said the democraticcontrolled legislature using new 
computer technology unlawfully manipulated district boundaries 
the ruling drew quick reaction from national political leaders 
including outgoing republican national committee chairman frank 
fahrenkopf and his successor lee atwater 
our immediate goal will be to increase republican 
representation and control in 1990 in statehouses so that the 
redistricting process following the next census will be in the hands 
of responsible elected officials conscious of their constitutional 
responsibilities a joint statement said 
rep beryl anthony jr dark chairman of the democratic 
congressional campaign committee welcomed the ruling 
the decision vindicates our judgment that the california 
redistricting plan was lawful and fair to the voters of 
california he said the republican party was trying to win in 
court what it could not win with the voters 
in other matters tuesday the court 
rejected multiple murderer theodore bundys challenge to his 
death sentence for killing a 12yearold girl in florida the man 
linked to as many as 36 sex slayings or disappearances of young 
women faces execution tuesday

agreed to decide whether people who intervene in civil rights 
cases and are not the principal defendants may be forced to pay 
the lawyer fees incurred by those who successfully sue the case 
stems from a sex bias lawsuit against trans world airlines 
heard arguments in a freespeech challenge to a massachusetts 
law that cracks down on child pornography the justices are to 
announce a decision by july 
in the california redistricting case chief justice william h 
rehnquist and justices john paul stevens and anthony m kennedy 
voted to grant full review to the dispute four votes are needed to 
grant such review 
the other six justices joined in upholding the lower court ruling 
sustaining the redistricting plan their onesentence decision said 
simply that the judgment is affirmed 
the court said in 1986 in an indiana legislative reapportionment 
case that gerrymandering the manipulation of voting district 
boundaries for partisan gain may be unlawful even when it results 
in districts meeting the oneperson onevote requirement that 
districts be equally populated 
the justices have held that only if there is evidence of racial 
bias may a district plan be overturned even when the balanced 
population test is met 
but in splintered voting the justices upheld the indiana plan 
that was attacked as a violation of democrats rights 
the 1986 decision left key questions unanswered and only four 
justices joined in the courts main opinion written by justice 
byron r white 
white said gerrymandering might be unconstitutional if it will 
consistently degrade a voters or a group of voters influence on 
the political processes as a whole 
california republicans said that is exactly what has happened to 
them 
the essence of representative democracy is undermined when 
a computergenerated gerrymander can preordain what the 
congressional results will be throughout the decade they said in 
seeking supreme court reconsideration 
a threejudge federal court by a 21 vote last april upheld 
californias plan 
the federal court said republicans failed to show that the plan 
deprived them of political power and fair representation 
there are no allegations that california republicans have been 
shut out of the political process nor are there allegations that 
anyone has ever interfered with republican registration organizing 
voting fundraising or campaigning said judge cecil f poole for 
the federal court 
poole noting that california has a republican governor a 
republican us senator and 18 gop house members said there is no 
evidence the party is bereft of the ability to exercise potent 
power in the political process as a whole 
republicans said the democraticcontrolled state legislature 
rigged district lines to allow democrats to win 27 of the 45 house 
seats from california even though republican candidates overall 
received roughly half the votes cast in recent elections

an environmental group says it is applying one 
of ronald reagans favorite slogans to george bushs claim to care 
about fighting pollution trust but verify 
david baker political director of friends of the earth said 
tuesday the slogan applies because bush spearheaded the reagan 
administrations drive to relax many government regulations early in 
its tenure 
were willing to take him at his word right now when he says 
hes an environmentalist but were keeping him on a short leash 
baker said trust but verify is slogan reagan has often quoted 
about arms control negotiations with the soviet union 
bakers was one of several advocacy groups represented at a news 
conference held by consumer activist ralph nader to promote their 
highly critical view of the reagan years 
the groups summed up their longstanding differences with the 
administrations regulation of food drugs the environment 
pesticides auto safety and energy 
the environmental protection administration was in bed with the 
polluters in the early years of the reagan administration baker 
said 
although that stopped with a change in agency leadership epa has 
removed only 18 sites from the list of 1175 scheduled for priority 
handling under the superfund toxic waste cleanup program and has 
completed work at only 45 more said baker 
nader said he called the news conference to offset what nader 
called an orchestrated media cloud nine that he blamed in part 
on the abdication of the role of loyal opposition by the 
democratic party none of whose leaders have made any attempt to 
reflect publicly on the record of the reagan government 
among the criticisms 
the administrations opposition to and delay of air bags in cars 
cost 40000 lives and 1 million injuries said joan claybrook head 
of public citizen the umbrella advocacy organization founded by 
nader ms claybrook was head of the national highway traffic safety 
administration in president carters administration 
relaxed oversight of drugs and medical devices cost thousands of 
lives said dr sidney m wolfe director of public citizens health 
research group delay of warnings on aspirin about reyes syndrome 
cost 1000 lives he said the worst of my fears have come to 
pass wolfe said 
the environmental protection agency plans to relax pesticide 
residue standards on foods and has adopted a farmworker protection 
policy that protects employers said jay feldman coordinator of 
the national campaign against the misuse of pesticides 
the administration failed to pursue conservation overemphasized 
nuclear power and rolled back auto efficiency standards complained 
ken bossong director of public citizens critical mass energy 
project and clarence ditlow executive director of the center for 
auto safety a group founded with naders help 
under orders from the white house fda fought hard to keep 
cancercausing food additives on the market has substituted 
politics and rigid ideology for reasoned scientific 
decisionmaking and has starved its food regulatory program so 
much that even the industry pleaded for bigger budgets said bruce 
silverglade legal director of the center for science in the public

presidentelect bush should set tough civil 
rights enforcement as a major goal of his administration a 
17member panel of former federal officials says 
there is a major rebuilding job to be done to reconstruct the 
machinery of enforcing civil rights washington attorney william 
l taylor said at a news conference called by the citizens 
commission on civil rights 
the private group released a 37page report titled one nation 
indivisible the civil rights challenge for the 1990s which 
offered evidence of a falloff in civil rights enforcement in the 
reagan era 
it said the justice department has filed 31 cases to challenge 
discriminatory voting practices since 1981 panel members called 
that a sharp drop from the record of earlier administrations 
the report also said enforcement of equal employment rules 
applying to federal contractors declined from 269 cases in 1980 to 
22 cases in 1986 
the department of housing and urban development estimates that 2 
million cases of housing bias occur each year but an average of 10 
housing discrimination cases have been filed annually the report 
said 
taylor said that number represented about half the level under 
the administrations of former presidents carter and nixon 
justice department spokesman mark weaver criticized the notion 
that there has been a slowdown 
he cited a victory in a key housing bias case in yonkers ny 
as well as a major voting rights case pending against los angeles 
county and a lawsuit filed two months ago to bar alleged hiring 
discrimination by new jerseys police hiring system 
weve taken heat for these things but weve continued to 
enforce the laws strenuously he said 
he said he could not readily verify that the eightyear total of 
voting rights cases was 31 but he did say that because court 
actions under previous administrations remain in place the number 
by definition gets smaller 
as for cases involving federal contractors he said the justice 
department has no authority to initiate suits and merely acts on 
matters referred to it by the labor department 
arthur flemming chairman of the commission said the group was 
sending its report to bush in the hope that he can turn around the 
80s as far as civil rights enforcement is concerned

the public is likely to view higher levies on 
gasoline alcohol and tobacco as tax increases even if politicians 
try to softpedal them by calling them user fees 
presidentelect bushs incoming budget director says 
the comments by richard darman shed light on the thinking of the 
new administration and bush who campaigned on a pledge of no new 
taxes lawmakers and others in washington have been closely watching 
the words of bush and his aides to see if the vice president backs 
off his campaign promise 
darman submitted written answers to questions posed by the senate 
governmental affairs committee which holds confirmation hearings 
thursday on his appointment the questionnaire and responses were 
obtained tuesday from a source who asked to not be identified 
darman who has been tapped as bushs chief of the office of 
management and budget said that depending on the application of 
funds taxes on gasoline tobacco and alcohol might be called user 
fees 
but he added the public however tends to see these rather 
unequivocally as taxes 
he said fees for government services are not a tax as long as 
the government is directly charging the beneficiary only for the 
cost of the service provided by the government 
he also said eliminating the deduction for interest on certain 
types of borrowing and taxing employerprovided fringe benefits 
could be considered definitional changes 
one could engage in long discussions of when one or another 
revenue measure is or is not a tax darman wrote 
putting academics and sophistry aside however my suspicion is 
that in the end such definitional matters are political applying 
the old ifitlookslikeaduck rule if it looks like a tax to most 
americans its a tax 
many congressional democrats have said they do not understand how 
the fiscal 1990 deficit can be reduced to 100 billion as required 
by the grammrudman balanced budget law without new taxes 
senate budget committee chairman jim sasser dtenn asked 
tuesday about darmans comments on taxes said president reagan was 
never tagged as a taxer even though he signed 11 tax increases into 
law 
george bush may find he wants to try to follow in that 
tradition but one thing should be clear we in congress stand ready 
to work with the administration to deal with these massive deficits 
regardless of semantics and we look forward to a budget proposal 
from george bush he said in a written statement 
house budget committee chairman leon panetta dcalif also 
discussed budget matters tuesday indicating that the 13 billion in 
new revenues contained in the spending plan reagan submitted last 
week might be a good starting point for negotiations between the 
white house and congress 
if the reagan number is used which is 13 billion then 
obviously that gives us the opportunity to look not only at those 
that were suggested by the administration but other areas as well 
in order to meet that number panetta told members of the national 
press club 
panetta said the revenue raisers proposed by reagan along with 
excise taxes on items such as energy are worthy of 
consideration 
in his budget reagan proposed raising new money by selling 
federal assets imposing or increasing user fees repealing a 
reduction in aviation taxes and other measures

a select group of 190 house members stockpiled 
392 million in campaign money that can be converted to their 
personal use under a loophole in election laws a nonprofit group 
says 
public citizens congress watch noted tuesday that the select 
group is covered by a special provision in federal law permitting 
those who were serving in the house on jan 8 1980 to keep any 
remaining campaign funds 
the report also said the members of the house elected to the new 
congress have built combined campaign war chests of 67 million 
public citizen is a research lobbying and litigation group 
founded by consumer advocate ralph nader in 1971 
its report blamed the surplus campaign chests for the 98 percent 
success rate among house incumbents running in 1988 and 1986 
adding there is a greater turnover in the supreme soviet than in 
the us house of representatives 
this certainly discourages qualified candidates from 
challenging the financially stronger representatives and further 
ensures the incumbent lock on the house 
the report covered the period from jan 1 1987 through nov 28 
1988 
the 67 million in surplus money averages 154000 per member up 
39 percent from the 198586 balance of 484 million an average of 
111332 
the 392 million stockpiled by 189 current members and the late 
rep bill nichols dala for possible personal use is a 34 percent 
increase from the amount on hand in january 1987 
those who can take advantage of the loophole can watch their 
money grow until they retire the report said the money can 
be transferred to other political races donated to their favorite 
charities while writing off the tax deduction used to buy a new 
car or pay for that needed vacation according to the report 
the report said reps david dreier rcalif stephen j solarz 
dny and dan rostenkowski dill each have more than 1 million 
stockpiled with solarz and rostenkowski permitted to convert the 
money to personal use 
after surveying how former house members used the money the 
report said that rep mario biaggi dny spent 386064 in 
leftover campaign funds on legal expenses related to his criminal 
convictions 
he was found guilty of accepting an illegal gratuity and 
obstruction of justice in accepting a paid florida vacation from a 
former brooklyn democratic leader and of racketeering and accepting 
bribes from wedtech corp in exchange for his washington influence 
the late rep james howard dnj left 310000 to his wife 
and the late rep john duncan rtenn left more than 600000 to 
his family the report said

suicides and other unnatural deaths have increased 
by 50 percent during the 1980s the official xinhua news agency said 
today 
a survey of 10 million people in 25 locales found that the death 
rate from unnatural causes increased from 31 per 100000 people in 
1981 to 47 in 1987 
fourfifths of the deaths came by suicide drowning poisoning 
and traffic accidents xinhua said the report did not say if murder 
was included in the statistics 
china gives no statistics on suicide but xinhua said that in the 
countryside where most chinese live onethird of unnatural deaths 
were by suicide more women than men took their own lives it said 
the survey found that family disputes marital problems and poor 
personal relations led to half the suicides about 20 percent of 
suicides were terminally ill patients 
the report said twothirds of those killing themselves used 
poison and called for tighter control over dispensing of poisons 
tens of thousands of chinese are believed to have killed 
themselves during the 196676 cultural revolution when 
ultraleftists persecuted huge numbers of people 
today most suicides are linked to personal problems and 
difficulties in adjusting to social changes as china switches to a 
more marketoriented competitive economic system last year the 
nations first nongovernmental suicide prevention center was 
established in canton

should he be hoisted by his own petard george 
herbert walker bush will begin his presidency with one of the sorest 
arms in history 
about 35000 little american flags will be distributed to 
spectators at his inaugural friday at least 700 larger flags will 
be carried before him in the hourslong parade to follow 
can the man who espoused the pledge of allegiance to the flag 
with religious fervor in the last campaign get by with just an 
occasional salute with all those flags just a token movement of 
the arm toward the heart could leave bush with the sorest arm since 
sandy koufax quit baseball 
the marching band from the university of texas alone could wear 
out the new president its 320 marchers will carry 30 flags along 
with 60 trumpets 40 trombones 20 baritones 24 tubas 26 
percussion 36 clarinet 30 french horns 25 saxophones and 24 
piccolos can a man from texas stand motionless before all that 
the statistics come courtesy of the inaugural committee which 
produced a handbook of breathtaking scope it tells far more than 
you could possibly want to know about inaugurals in compelling 
detail for example 
bush and the six presidents before him were all born between 1908 
and 1924 a fact the need of which is not yet clear 
bush will rank with the four tallest presidents in history 
behind abe lincoln lyndon johnson and thomas jefferson he also 
will enter history books as one of four lefthanded presidents the 
others being james garfield harry truman and gerald ford 
the dome of the capitol expands and contracts as much as four 
inches because of the heat of the sun by day and cooling by night 
which is in sharp contrast to most of its tenants who are known to 
expand frequently and contract seldom 
mrs william howard taft was the first woman to ride in an 
inaugural parade in 1913 warren harding was the first president to 
ride to his swearingin in a car richard nixon was the first to 
review his parade behind bulletproof glass 
bush is 31st among college graduates who made it to the white 
house 12th among phi beta kappa boys second among yale men 
married 44 years george and barbara bush bring the ninth longest 
marriage to the white house john and abigail adams were married the 
longest 54 years and three days but bush is the only president 
born in june 
you will also sleep better knowing that andrew johnson was the 
only vice president visibly drunk at his inaugural a condition he 
blamed on alcohol consumed to combat the pain of typhoid fever 
should you need more for your next game of trivial pursuit 
remember jefferson had the first running water in the white house 
from a cistern he put in the roof millard fillmore had the first 
bathtub installed rutherford hayes the first telephone william 
mckinley the first elevator franklin roosevelt the first 
dishwasher 
but george herbert walker bush will be the first captain of a 
yale baseball team to become president indisputably

dan quayle says that as vice president he hopes 
to help open up the republican party to the poor and minorities and 
turn around its image as the party of exclusion 
the vice presidentelect said that after he is sworn in to office 
on friday he hopes to spend time quietly visiting the disadvantaged 
and learning about their problems 
id like to go out and not have a lot of advance publicity on 
that just sit down and talk to these people on their turf in their 
neighborhood on their grounds and to hear them out and get a feel 
and get a sensitivity for issues that are of concern to them 
quayle said in an interview tuesday with the associated press 
the former senator from indiana also endorsed the 50 percent 
congressional pay raise that president reagan backs bush has said 
he supports reagans stance but that he might take another look at 
the matter after he becomes president 
i know its a lot quayle said of the raise for federal 
judges and congress members but he said reagan thought long and 
hard i support his decision 
the pay raise plan will take effect next month unless congress 
vetoes or modifies it 
on another subject quayle said soviet leader mikhail s 
gorbachev is in a much stronger position than many us skeptics 
think hes consolidated power much quicker than any other soviet 
general secretary said quayle a former member of the senate 
armed services committee 
quayle said he thinks gorbachevs policy of glasnost or 
openness is for real but he sees the perestroika policy of 
economic reform as just a way to consolidate power 
quayle has met with several reporters in the past few days after 
refusing interviews for much of the period since the nov 8 election 
discussing how he will handle his new job quayle said he will 
not speak out at cabinet meetings but will relay his opinions to 
president bush privately the key to his job he said is a close 
personal relationship with the new president 
the 41yearold vice presidentelect said he intends to be a 
broadranging adviser to bush who is 64 he said he has been 
involved in all of the discussions for cabinet choices and other 
matters except the early selection of james baker as secretary of 
state 
quayle said the assignments bush gives him will evolve with time 
and circumstances they will be of substance stature and of 
importance to the president 
when you are a broadranging adviser to the president you take 
on assignments from him that he deems are important and from time 
to time he will turn to me and say i need help here quayle 
said 
he said he meets daily with bush and they have discussed a desire 
to reposition the republican party and get out of this 
stereotype stereocast image of being the party of exclusion rather 
than the party of inclusion 
its this image that somehow you dont care and its just not 
true of me and its not true of george bush he said and 
unfortunately the republican party is still cast in that mold and 
were going to try and turn it around 
he promised the new administration would go to some of the 
places republicans havent gone before 
quayle has decided he wont spend as much time as he originally 
envisioned working as an administration advocate on capitol hill 
where the constitution gives him the job of senate president that 
is both because he wont have enough time he said and because many 
of his former colleagues want to have the communication up there 
on capitol hill but they also want to have the communication down 
here at his white house office 
since the election quayle said he doesnt sleep soundly the way 
he once did from 11 pm to 530 or 6 am 
i have to confess that periodically you wake up during the 
night and you think about the responsibilities and the challenges 
that are ahead of you he said and they are responsibilities 
that i certainly look forward to but they are certainly much 
different than just being a senator

artists such as frank stella and roy 
lichtenstein mingled with congressmen bureaucrats judges patrons 
diplomats and other dignitaries at a preinaugural party marking the 
10th anniversary of the national gallery of arts east building 
more than 1000 people attended the blacktie event tuesday 
night including im pei the architect who designed the east 
building at the foot of capitol hill supreme court justice anthony 
m kennedy art collector estee lauder sen charles robb dva 
and carla hills nominated by presidentelect bush to be us trade 
representative 
touring the gallerys newly mounted exhibition of 20th century 
paintings drawings and sculpture on three floors of the east 
building stella predicted that george bush will continue government 
support for the arts though without any great outpouring of 
federal assistance 
the emphasis will be on the performing arts said stella 
waving a cigar under one of the giant canvases he wont be 
interested in supporting the avant garde the governments job is to 
take care of the majority 
they dont need to take care of those who can take care of 
themselves said stella known for his minimalist paintings on 
different shaped canvases were not charity cases 
stella and lichtenstein agreed that the healthy economy favors 
artists by spurring purchase of their works as financial investments 
and additions to private collections 
the arts are doing very well now said lichtenstein who 
famous for his comic strip technique my guess is that they the 
bush administration will do more for the arts 
nevertheless he said its not that you just spend money and 
everything gets better its shameful too that we have such a 
wealthy government that supports art so little compared with other 
western countries 
the gallerys recently installed exibition of more than 230 early 
art works from picasso will remain on view for two years with 
support by a grant from american express

the government has ordered the name of one of josef 
stalins top lieutenants party ideologue andrei a zhdanov 
stripped from universities factories and cities nationwide 
the move tuesday is the latest in a series of actions taken to 
wipe out the names of late kremlin leaders and officials who have 
fallen into disgrace or disfavor under president mikhail s 
gorbachev 
last month communist authorities ordered the names of two recent 
soviet leaders leonid i brezhnev and konstantin u chernenko 
removed from their homes and from every town school and factory 
still named for them 
since coming to power in march 1985 gorbachev has been 
increasing critical of past soviet leaders calling stalins harsh 
29year rule a deviation from the ideals of soviet founder vladimir 
i lenin and blaming brezhnev for economic stagnation and corruption 
zhdanov first secretary of the leningrad communist party 
organization in 193444 died under mysterious circumstances in 1948 
he directed violent purges in the countrys secondlargest city 
following the 1934 assassination of sergei kirov the former 
leningrad party chief who opposed stalins dictatorial rule 
the liquidation of real or imagined opponents of stalin is seen 
by western historians as the dawn of the dictators 193438 great 
purge in which some 10 million soviets were arrested banished into 
internal exile or killed 
the evening tv news program vremya said a recommendation from 
the commpunst partys policymaking central committee to remove 
zhdanovs name from the map was sent to the supreme soviet 
presidium the nations top executive body and to the council of 
ministers and legislatures in the 15 republics 
zhdanov was one of the sponsors of massive repressions of the 
30s and 40s against guiltless soviet people said the 
announcement on vremya he is responsible for criminal actions 
committed at that time and for the violation of socialist law 
stripped of zhdanovs name were universities in leningrad and in 
the siberian city of irkutsk the soviet armys engineering academy 
and a locomotive works in the ukrainian city of poltava it said 
a ukrainian city on the sea of azov renamed zhdanov in 1948 
will revert to its former name of mariupol 
the recommendation from the central committee considered binding 
on soviet government bodies says zhdanovs name should be stricken 
from cities neighborhoods streets enterprises collective 
farms military units and institutions of learning 
in moscow both a neighborhood and a subway station bear 
zhdanovs name 
under stalin zhdanov also served for a time as party secretary 
for ideological affairs he introduced strict political control and 
extreme nationalism into the arts and opposed western cultural 
influences that were denounced as cosmopolitanism 
in 1953 a group of jewish doctors was accused of murdering 
zhdanov which touched off widespread fears among soviet jews that 
the kremlin might be laying the groundwork for an official campaign 
of antisemitism by staging a show trial of his purported assassins 
the announcement read on vremya and later carried by the tass 
news agency said zhdanovs name was being erased from the soviet 
landscape in response to the numerous requests of workers

a military affairs expert says there is good 
reason to believe that iraq and syria possess biological weapons 
and israeli officials confirm that iraq is close to creating such an 
arsenal while syria is in the research stage 
there is strong evidence to suggest that iraq has biological 
weapons possibly including toxins w seth carus a researcher at 
the washington institute for near east policy said tuesday 
carus who has been studying the proliferation of chemical and 
biological warfare in the middle east for the past several years at 
the privately funded think tank said reports from iran that iraq 
used biological agents against its kurdish minority are unreliable 
but he added he had been informed by official sources that iraq 
does have such capability iraq produces the weapons at a facility 
near the village of salman pak 35 miles southeast of baghdad abc 
news reported tuesday citing unnamed intelligence sources 
iraq also has the capacity to make 1000 tons of chemical agents 
annually carus said there is documented proof iraq used such 
weapons as mustard and nerve gas against iran and against the kurds 
as recently as 1987 syria manufactures chemical weapons but has 
never used them carus said 
syria also has a stock of biological arms but it is not known if 
it has acquired sophisticated delivery systems such as rockets 
carus said syria may have received help for its program from 
communist north korea which is known to have a biological warfare 
program carus said 
israeli officials said however that iraq had completed research 
and development on such weapons and was on the verge of 
manufacturing them syria is in the initial stages of research said 
the officials who spoke only on condition they not be named 
toxins such as snake venoms are poisons which are not 
biological agents but can easily be produced by using bacteria 
cultures biological weapons are living organisms that cause lethal 
diseases such as cholera anthrax and typhoid they can be 
introduced into water systems or simply sprayed into the air 
iraq which signed but did not ratify the 1972 biological weapons 
treaty denies having biological or chemical arms 
a state department official declined to say if the united states 
is aware of the iraqi capability 
egypt is believed to have worked on acquiring biological weapons 
in the 1960s carus said in the early 1970s the late egyptian 
president anwar sadat said we have the instruments of biological 
warfare in the refrigerators 
but egypt did not use the germs in its 1973 war with israel or in 
any other conflict carus said 
israel has the ability to produce biological agents although 
it may not currently have a biological warfare capability carus 
said iran has said it intends to acquire such capability but 
little is known about that plan he added

us automakers are urging the government to 
uphold a customs service decision to impose a high import duty on 
sport vehicles and vans 
the chairmen of the three largest us auto manufacturers 
general motors corp ford motor co and chrysler corp urged 
treasury secretary nicholas brady on tuesday to affirm a customs 
decision that the popular vehicles are trucks and therefore are 
subject to a 25 percent import duty 10 times the duty levied on 
cars 
a reversal of the ruling would cause substantial harm to the 
us motor vehicle industry deprive the us treasury of several 
hundred million dollars in anticipated tariff revenues and unleash 
a long battle in the courts and in congress said gms roger 
smith fords donald petersen and chryslers lee iacocca 
a group representing dealers in imported vehicles however 
estimated the higher duty would directly add 500 million a year to 
the cost of buying cars in the united states 
this is a 500 million new tax in effect said bart fisher 
attorney for the american international automobile dealers 
association 
the associations president robert mcelwaine estimated the 
higher import duty would add on average 2500 to the price of each 
vehicle about 200000 imported vehicles a year would be affected

sovietdesigned jet fighters and other russian weapons on the open 
market for the past year to test their effectiveness and to train 
american servicemen 
pentagon spokeswoman jan bodanyi said the purchases began in 
early 1988 and so far have involved buying from international arms 
dealers or private citizens soviet mig15 17 and 21 jet fighters 
the defense department also has bought soviet airdefense 
equipment such as radar systems with a view toward better training 
american pilots she added 
the us military has long conducted tests and experiments with 
military equipment made in the soviet union warsaw pact and third 
world countries and later captured stolen or covertly purchased 
the pentagon had not acknowledged previously however that 
efforts are now made to buy soviet weaponry in an open manner in the 
worlds arms bazaars rather than to keep such transactions secret 
last september the pentagon announced the creation of a new 
organization known as the mobile operational test force set up by

the television movie the ryan white story 
got mixed reviews from the players in the real saga the hemophiliac 
boy who was barred from school after being diagnosed with aids 
the hollywood version starring george c scott judith light and 
lukas haas was broadcast monday night on abc 
if the purpose of the film was to portray ryan his family and 
his feelings then i am sure it was accurate as they saw it said 
ron colby principal of western middle school which barred ryan 
from attending after he was diagnosed with acquired immune 
deficiency syndrome in december 1984 
i thought george c scott played a nice charlie vaughan ryans 
attorney and lukas haas reminded me a lot of ryan the film 
captured the relentless pressure applied to all by the media 
but david rosselot the attorney for parents who sought to keep 
ryan out of school called the film a subtle insult to the 
community as a whole simply because it left the impression that the 
community was antiryan white when in the proper context it was 
not antiryan white but antiaids in the classroom 
the 17yearold ryan who appeared on abcs good morning america 
on monday said people in kokomo were apprehensive about how the 
movie would depict them but their behavior was much worse than the 
movie lets on 
charles vaughn ryans attorney said the movie was accurate but 
he wished the courtroom scenes had distinguished the difference 
between the white familys case against the local school 
corporation which initially sought to bar ryan and the injunction 
against the boy won by other parents 
ryans family eventually prevailed in both battles but they have 
since moved south to cicero and ryan is attending hamilton heights 
high school in arcadia 
vaughan said the movie was very good to kokomo 
they better not complain he said i could fill a book with 
the conduct of the western school corporation 
a western official who was school board president at the time did 
not watch the movie 
im a high school graduate i know the meaning of the word 
fiction said don carter

soviet planes delivered tons of arms 
and ammunition to the moscowbacked afghan government last week and 
lifted red army troops out of kabul at twice the usual rate 
diplomats say 
at the current pace the red armys withdrawal could be completed 
by the end of january western diplomats in islamabad said tuesday 
however for political reasons the russians may wish to keep a 
military presence in kabul up to feb 15 said one 
under a unbrokered accord moscow has pledged to remove its 
remaining troops from afghanistan by that date although kabuls 
ruling marxists have not reached a settlement with the moslem 
insurgents who have battled them for more than a decade 
the soviets who intervened in december 1979 are demanding a 
role in a postwar government for members of the current regime 
but the guerrillas most of whom are based in bordering pakistan 
reject any powersharing and according to a un official will 
convene a meeting of a 500member council by feb 1 in an attempt to 
form a transitional government 
benon sevan who has been shuttling between kabul and pakistan 
seeking a political settlement told a news conference at un 
headquarters in new york on tuesday that the conferences 
composition is still under discussion 
the western diplomats who spoke on condition they not be 
identified further said takeoffs and landings of soviet il76 
transport planes at kabul airport numbered about 40 between jan 9 
and 14 or twice the usual rate 
soviet troops were seen boarding the planes after afghan troops 
unloaded tons of military equipment and ammunition 
as many as 18 ss1 scud missiles were transported from the 
airport during the period according to diplomats and western 
journalists 
soviet armor has been digging into new positions north of the 
hindukush mountains along the snowbound salang road which runs some 
240 miles from kabul north to the soviet union the sources said 
the road is a principal evacuation route for red army troops 
the sources said that judging by convoys arriving in kabul 
sovietafghan forces apparently have been able to keep the route 
open despite harassment by the insurgents 
diplomats said workers have been busy cutting down trees and 
leveling earth along the avenue that runs past the afghan defense 
ministry and the soviet embassy in southern kabul one source 
speculated the workers were preparing an emergency airstrip next to 
the soviet mission 
moscow and kabul continue to accuse islamabad and washington of 
violating the pullout accord by continuing to arm and supply the 
rebels many of whom operate from bases in pakistan

britain has become one of europes filthiest 
nations its city streets a jungle of garbage and graffiti the 
governmentfunded royal fine arts commission said in a report today 
london is filthy worse than comparable cities in mainland 
europe says the report which blames the problem on a growing 
lack of personal discipline 
the same is true of britain as a whole as children chuck away 
sweet candy wrappers and ice lolly wrappings and adults calmly 
wind down car windows and dispatch empty cans as well as squashed 
paper packets as they speed to their presumably wellkept homes or 
places of work it says 
the author commission urban affairs specialist judy hillman 
said that although the report entitled a new look for london 
concentrates on the capital the problems affect all of britain 
the report describes street gutters filled with empty beverage 
cans and old newspapers plastic garbage sacks dumped around 
lampposts often spilling their contents on to the sidewalk and 
roadsides lined with discarded mattresses broken chairs old 
stoves abandoned supermarket carts and other trash 
other complaints were of overflowing litter bins remains of 
fastfood meals strewn around shopping malls and dog and pigeon 
excrement on sidewalks and in public parks 
the report also noted graffiti on trains the london subway 
buses and in illdesigned areas of urban residential wilderness 
and almost any convenient blank stone or painted wall 
it said people increasingly graze in and around shopping 
malls eating on the move and dropping food and wrappers on the way 
prime minister margaret thatcher in a foreword to the report 
wrote of the need for residents of all the countrys municipalities 
to involve themselves in the upkeep and improvement of their local 
streets and centers 
the report recommends that the banks of the river thames be 
turned into a national park legislation covering officially 
designated national parks imposes rigorous controls on the 
collection of garbage and similar matters 
in july 1986 government ministers and pop music entrepreneur 
richard branson launched a 40 million drive using taxpayers money 
to clean up britains streets countryside and derelict industrial 
land 
but londoners and foreign visitors say there has been little 
evidence that the project has had much effect 
the royal fine arts commission was first set up in 1924 to advise 
government departments on projects and developments affecting 
national or public amenities

volcanoes killed more people in the 80s 
than during the previous 78 years yet the deadly peaks are 
inadequately monitored to protect 350 million people who live near 
their slopes a geologist says 
we have to do a better job of studying the volcanoes of the 
world said robert tilling a us geological survey geologist who 
coordinated the agencys response to the mount st helens eruption 
existing methods of monitoring volcanoes are proving relatively 
reliable we just dont do enough of it 
since ad 1000 more than 300000 people died from volcanic flows 
lava pyroclastic or mud tsunamis and posteruption starvation 
tilling said in a summary of his remarks for todays annual meeting 
of the american association for the advancement of science 
mudflows from colombias nevado del ruiz killed at least 22000 
people in 1985 while more than 2000 perished in pyroclastic flows 
blasts of hot gas rock and ash from mexicos el chichon in 
1982 tilling said mount st helens left 57 people dead or missing 
in 1902 pyroclastic flows killed 29000 near mount pelee in 
martinique 6000 near santa maria volcano in guatemala and 1560 
in the eruption of soufriere on st vincent said tilling who is 
based in washington dc 
his count shows 13080 more died during the six other deadly 
eruptions this century three volcanoes in 1951 and three others in 
1911 1919 and 1963 
an average of 50 of earths 600 volcanoes erupt each year most 
without fatalities and the rate has not changed much in 
historical times but because the world population has exploded 
to 5 billion in 1987 the problem posed by volcanic and associated 
hazards is greater now than ever before he said 
he said more than 350 millon people live on or within danger 
range of volcanoes about 14 percent of the population 
we spend a lot of effort at a few volcanoes and we need to 
tilling said in an interview but were not applying existing 
monitoring technology to more volcanoes especially in developing 
countries where the risks and hazards are the greatest 
and he said the most dangerous volcanoes are the least studied 
part of the problem tilling said is that volcanoes erupt 
infrequently compared with natural hazards such as earthquakes 
major storms floods and landslides 
however in populated areas even very small eruptions can wreak 
havoc and cause widespread devastation such as the nevado del ruiz 
eruption 
the mountain blew out only 3 percent as much ash as mount st 
helens may 18 1980 explosion but the tiny colombian eruption 
melted glacial ice burying armero and other towns under mudflows 
he said 
tilling urged an international effort to reduce volcano deaths 
the national academy of science and united nations previously have 
endorsed an international scientific effort for the 1990s designated 
the international decade for natural hazards reduction 
to reduce volcano deaths scientists must identify highrisk 
mountains study their geology to learn how often eruptions occur 
and whether the eruptions were explosive map the routes of killer 
flows to identify danger zones then install monitoring equipment 
where necessary to listen for earthquakes uplift and tilting and 
other signs of activity 
asked who should pay the bill for better volcano monitoring 
tilling replied theres the question 
tilling said the 10 most deadly eruptions since ad 1000 were 
tambora indonesia 1815 92000 deaths including 80000 from 
starvation 
krakatau indonesia 1883 36420 killed by tsunamis or 
volcanic tidal waves 
mount pelee martinique 1902 29000 dead 
nevado del ruiz colombia 1985 at least 22000 
vesuvius italy 1631 18000 killed

eggs beef and other tasty dishes 
considered bad for the heart can be made healthy by replacing the 
dangerous fats in those foods with safe ones a top researcher 
predicts 
almost every sensible eating plan advocated by health groups 
calls for cutting out fat in order to avoid the saturated fat that 
contributes to heart disease and to prevent overweight 
but while such diets may be healthy they usually mean skimping 
on the meat ice cream pastries and other tasty things most 
americans think are good food 
for americans lowfat diets are not close to reality they 
find lowfat diets unpalatable said dr scott m grundy who 
described his work tuesday at a meeting of the american heart 
association 
grundy coauthor of past dietary statements by the association 
and director of the center for human nutrition at the university of 
texas southwestern medical center in dallas has been searching for 
safe fats that can take place of the dangerous ones americans like 
so much 
typically sensible eating plans urge people to restrict fat 
intake to 30 percent of their total daily intake of calories and 
suggest that fat consumption be divided roughly equally between the 
three major kinds saturated polunsaturated and monounsaturated 
saturated fat is found in relatively high quantities in meat and 
foods that contain butter fat or palm oil the body converts this 
fat to cholesterol and it clogs the arteries that supply the heart 
leading to heart attacks 
grundy said two imporant substitutes for saturated fat should be 
monounsaturated fat and stearic acid 
monounsaturated fat is found in olive oil canola oil and some 
forms of safflower oil and sunflower seed oil grundys studies have 
shown that eating monounsaturates will lower the bodys levels of 
lowdensity lipoprotein or ldl the socalled bad cholesterol that 
contributes to heart disease but unlike polyunsaturated fat it 
does not lower hdl the good cholesterol that protects people from 
heart trouble 
stearic acid is found in meat and other foods while it is a 
saturated fat grundys work has shown that it does not raise 
cholesterol he said that it should take the place of palm oil in 
margarine and shortening 
other research shows that a sterol or an unsaturated alcohol 
produced by plants can be added to eggs preventing the body from 
absorbing the cholesterol in egg yolks grundy said 
fat substitutes are also being developed that are entirely 
caloriefree and meat producers are starting to raise lowfat beef 
this does not mean however that people will be able to eat fat 
with abandon grundy said 
fat contains more calories than carbohydrates he said 
this could backfire if people see it as a license to eat fat and 
get fat 
on the other hand he said some people may find it easier to 
keep their weight down on a higherfat diet because this food 
satisfies their hunger better and thus they eat less 
grundy said the recommendation that fat consumption be held to 30 
percent of total calories is still a good general guideline but 
that it doesnt have to be the rule for everyone 
some individuals may prefer higher fat intakes without concern 
for detrimental effect he said

children whose families escaped the 
horrors of the vietnam war saw their schoolyard turned into a 
killing field the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and 
a pistol bearing the word victory 
after the massacre at recess the bodies of three southeast asian 
children were outlined in blue on the playground of cleveland 
elementary school where they died two others had been dragged by 
teachers inside to a classroom but also died twentynine other 
pupils were wounded along with a teacher 
there was shooting all over i was scared said 
sixthgrader binh hoang who was born in vietnam in 1975 in the 
final days of war and had never before heard gunfire everybody 
was crying in my class 
police said a drifter identified as patrick edward purdy 26 
armed with two handguns and an ak47 assault rifle entered the 
school grounds around noontime tuesday and fired about 60 rounds 
before he shot himself to death 
afterward a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on the 
ground near a pool of blood and the gunmans body the word 
victory was written on the pistol handle 
binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began 
outside the woodandstucco school building her teacher told 
students to get under their desks 
the gunfire startled michael cuevas whose first thought was that 
the university of the pacific fraternities near his house were 
firing their miniature cannon again 
but the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon and the scream 
of sirens that followed told him this time was no prank 
i never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in 
stockton said cuevas a 29yearold marine clerk at the port of 
stockton who lives down the street from the elementary school 
its always in some other town some other place its a shock 
to my senses i dont think its even hit me as hard as its going 
to you dont know whether to be excited or confused or what 
police cars and news reporters crowded the street which 
typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their 
children 
why here said jeff russell 37 who was born and reared in 
the neighborhood this has always been a sleepy little town the 
shooting put us back on the map 
lutheran and baptist churches border the school in a neighborhood 
of ranchstyle homes postagestamp lawns and streets lined with 
sycamore and oak trees in this agricultural city of 150000 people 
60 miles southeast of san francisco 
the 40yearold neighborhood near the university of the pacific 
is still home to many retired couples who raised their familes 
there but the city has been changing with the influx of southeast 
asian refugees 
when school officials called clergy to console grieving families 
buddhist priests in sandals and saffron robes arrived along with 
their whitecollared christian counterparts 
about 60 percent of cleveland elementarys students are of 
southeast asian descent said john klose spokesman for the stockton 
school district the five children who were killed were vietnamese 
and cambodian 
this is one of our best neighborhood schools klose said 
of all of our schools that i would think of something like this 
happening this would be the last one i would think of 
across the street sarah abbott stood astride her bicycle and 
gazed at the school where she graduated many years ago the 
professional nanny said she was at the house of her 97yearold 
grandfather about a block from the school when the gunman set his 
car on fire before starting to shoot 
when the car exploded my grandpas house just shook abbott 
said it scared me it was just too close

multimillionaire robert hearin has paid 1 
million in ransom and spent six anguishfilled months awaiting word 
on his kidnapped wife and neighbors say it might be time to accept 
shell never return 
for fear of sounding callous i dont want to say that but yet 
i think as time goes by people are becoming increasingly despondent 
about the chances of solving 73yearold annie laurie hearins 
disappearance julia yandell said tuesday 
yandall and others in jacksons posh woodland hills neighborhood 
have been on edge since july 26 when mrs hearin was abducted from 
her home 
fbi agents also arent as optimistic as they were a few months 
ago 
were pursuing leads new things develop all the time but 
nothing at this time looks real promising said fbi agent stewart 
murphy 
murphy said he couldnt discuss the case while its still being 
investigated but said police are hoping something will come of 
hearins sept 8 offer of a 100000 reward for information leading 
to his wifes safe return 
hearin 70 who may be the wealthiest man in mississippi has 
shunned publicity most of his life and his name was virtually 
unknown until his wife who he met before world war ii was 
kidnapped 
at an aug 7 news conference he pleaded for her return and 
family members were interviewed on a nov 9 segment of the nbc 
television program unsolved mysteries which generated about 300 
calls that didnt pan out 
the hearin family very much appreciates your interest but they 
dont have any comment at this time a spokeswoman said tuesday 
when asked if hearin his son and daughter plan any new appeals 
hearin worth an estimated 200 million controls mississippis 
largest gas distribution company mississippi valley gas co its 
secondlargest bank trustmark national bank and its secondlargest 
insurance company lamar life corp 
ironically the kidnappers vague note demanded that an 
unspecified amount of money be given to 12 former franchise owners 
sued by school pictures inc one of hearins more obscure 
businesses 
a letter with an atlanta postmark received aug 15 is the only 
message mrs hearins family has received the letter urged hearin 
to comply with the demands 
hearin paid a total of about 1 million on aug 16 to the 12 
people most of whom returned the money but investigators never 
heard from the kidnapper again 
neighbors say there was a time when publicity was welcome 
ammunition in the fight to find their friend but there comes a time 
when the memory of the wellliked society matron should be left in 
peace and they say perhaps that time is here 
i dont think the neighbors dont think theres much hope 
after all this time of finding her alive shes a very frail 
person said one neighbor who has known mrs hearin for about 
at least 30 or 40 years 
mrs hearin suffers from ileitis a chronic inflammation of the 
small intestines which could be fatal if she doesnt receive daily 
steroid medication officials have said 
the longtime friend who asked that her name not be published 
said she felt hearins ordeal has been made more painful by 
continuing attention from the media 
it would be better to leave him alone she said

a koreanamerican businessman accused of 
trying to buy deadly nerve gas for export was held on 2 million 
bail after a prosecutor argued the man might flee to his highlevel 
contacts overseas 
assistant us attorney anne singer said juwhan yun 49 
bragged that he had close personal contacts with highranking 
civilian and military officials in many countries including 
yugoslavia the peoples republic of china and south korea 
us magistrate ronald hedges set the 2 million figure at a bail 
hearing tuesday for yun of short hills yun had not posted bail as 
of tuesday night and his lawyer said he will ask the mans friends 
to help 
hedges imposed strict travel restrictions ordered yuns family 
to surrender their passports and forbade yun to make overseas 
contacts should bail be met 
yun was arrested thursday and charged with conspiring to 
illegally export the nerve gas sarin possibly to iran the 
complaint said yun also discussed acquiring antiaircraft and 
antitank missiles and military radar equipment with an undercover 
agent 
yun has pleaded innocent 
the magistrate said that even though the crime was not a violent 
one it was serious enough to merit high bail 
if true the charge certainly demonstrates an attempt by the 
defendant to profit from death to others hedges said 
yuns lawyer stephen n dratch said he hoped yuns friends 
might be willing to post their property as surety yun owns a 
400000 new york city condominium and lives in a 650000 house but 
had a total equity excluding mortgages of only 350000 which 
hedges said could go toward the bail 
dratch said yun earned 150000 a year from his importexport 
business hedges said he doubted yun could support a wife three 
children extensive travel and 64800 in yearly mortgage payments 
on that amount 
ms singer added that yun had recently bought a new luxury car 
yun entered the courtroom shackled his wife sat in the second 
row her hands clasped in her lap and her eyes closed through most 
of the hearing 
ms singer disclosed that yun had sought to acquire mark 193 
grenade launchers during the seven months of negotiations with the 
undercover agent the 40 mm weapon acquired by the army five years 
ago can fire up to 375 grenades a minute 
when the arrest was announced officials said iran at one point 
was identified as the nerve gass destination but that was not 
verified and no foreign government officials appeared to be involved 
ms singer told hedges that yun was planning an aroundtheworld 
trip in january to beijing iran europe and south korea also she 
identified as french citizens two men who met with yun and an 
accused coconspirator in london over the nerve gas deal 
authorities have said they were trying to identify the men who 
were under surveillance at the meeting 
a warrant has been issued for the second man charles caplan of 
london authorities said they were considering the possibility of 
seeking his extradition 
dratch said yun came to the united states in 1972 and was 
naturalized six years later after receiving a masters degree from 
the american graduate school of international management he founded 
his business komex international corp of summit in san francisco 
in 1980

radical students carrying sledgehammers 
attacked and damaged a us cultural center today in kwangju 
hurling firebombs and rocks and attempting to burn down the 
building authorities said 
police in the southern provincial city said about 50 students 
rushed into the compound yelling antiamerican slogans and threw 
stones and about 50 firebombs they said about 15 protesters climbed 
onto the roof and tried to start a fire 
drive out yankee imperialists attackers chanted during the 
attack in the city 180 miles south of seoul 
a us embassy spokesman in seoul said no one was injured in the 
attack and the protesters did not get inside the cultural center he 
said 30 windows were broken one official vehicle was damaged and 
tiles were ripped from the roof when attackers tried to set the 
building on fire 
parts of the building and a police post were damaged by 
firebombs the us spokesman said 
at least one us official was in the building at the time but 
the staff locked the doors and waited to be rescued the spokesman 
said the police who routinely guard the building were too few to 
stop the attack he said 
riot police drove the attackers off with tear gas and arrested 
two who had scaled the roof and were shouting slogans through a 
bullhorn police officials said the other attackers fled they said 
the attackers also denounced president roh taewoo chanting 
down with roh taewoo 
the attackers unfurled a banner on the roof saying punish roh 
taewoo and the yankees the enemies of our nation 
about 100 other students watched and applauded the attackers but 
did not take part and were dispersed when riot police arrived the 
officials said 
police said the attackers were from chonnam university in kwangju 
the attack came shortly after about 200 students battled riot 
police with firebombs at chosun university in kwangju police said 
riot police fired tear gas to disperse the radicals in that 
incident they said 
the kwangju center is operated by the us information service to 
sponsor cultural activities and serve as an information center for 
the united states it provides a library and other facilities to 
residents 
the incident came the day after roh told a nationally televised 
news conference that us troops must remain in the country until 
peace is achieved with communist north korea 
radical students have staged a series of attacks on us 
diplomatic buildings in recent months demanding an end to american 
influence in south korea and withdrawal of the 42000 us troops 
based in the nation under a mutual defense treaty 
the radicals who have little public support claim the united 
states has backed military rule in south korea and washington keeps 
troops in the south to block unification with north korea 
us officials have said american forces will remain in south 
korea as long as their presence is deemed necessary by south korean 
leaders 
american forces have been based in the country since the united 
states intervened to help the south against the north korean 
invasion that triggered the 195053 korean war

the investigation of the 1980 
assassination of archbishop oscar romero will continue despite the 
supreme courts refusal to extradite a former army captain 
implicated in the murder says president jose napoleon duarte 
he told reporters on tuesday during a visit to a downtown 
hospital construction site that the government has continued trying 
to solve the case and we will continue as far as we can 
the case definitely is not closed justice minister julio 
alfredo samayoa said in a telephone interview 
some believe the case was effectively closed last month when the 
countrys highest court refused to extradite former capt alvaro 
saravia from the united states in 1987 duartes administration 
accused saravia of arranging the assassination of romero who was 
slain while saying mass in march 1980 
during his weekly homilies romero had called on soldiers and 
security forces to halt the thenrampant murders of suspected 
leftists 
duarte alleges saravia acted on orders from roberto daubuisson 
a cashiered army intelligence major and leader of the rightist 
republican nationalist alliance political party known as arena 
daubuisson allegedly directed rightwing death squads in the 
early 1980s but denies any link to death squads and any 
responsibility in romeros murder 
arena accuses the christian democrats of bringing up the case 
before every election in an effort to erode its electoral base el 
salvador holds presidential elections march 19 arena which won 
legislative and municipal elections in last march leads the 
christian democrats in recent polls 
saravia 46 was freed thursday from the miami jail where he had 
spent 13 months awaiting resolution of the extradition request and 
illegal immigration charges pending against him he lives in the 
miami suburb of kendall and his attorney said he is seeking 
political asylum 
the salvadoran supreme court ruled dec 19 that testimony linking 
saravia to the assassination was not credible

state agencies last year investigated more than 
11000 cases of human rights violations in china including torture 
illegal arrests and unwarranted search and seizure the nations 
leading newspaper reported today 
in an unusual report the peoples daily said more than 50 
highranking officials 2600 government workers including 
policemen and 1250 employees of collective enterprises committed 
such violations 
the story cited an example of officer wang xiugang a policeman 
from hengyang a city in hunan province who took bribes to have 
criminals released from jail 
wang traveled to canton province nine times and secured the 
release of 36 prisoners using bogus letters of introduction the 
paper said for his services he was bribed 1784 or about 50 
times the average chinese police officers monthly salary the paper 
said 
last year wang was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in jail 
the report said that of the 11300 cases investigated last year 
4454 involved wrongful charges forced confessions torture 
illegal arrests and unwarranted search and seizure other cases 
concerned dereliction of duty and using ones office for profit it 
said 
one of the cases cited was a fire in daxinganling in northeastern 
china in may 1987 which left 193 people dead and millions of acres 
burned in all 11 people were sentenced to prison terms for 
dereliction of duty 
one official involved ordered fire trucks to protect his own 
house while the fire ravaged an oil depot and a grain warehouse the 
report said another official at the time the head of a fire 
prevention bureau fled the fire on a motorcycle it said 
the article was unusual in that it openly mentioned torture 
forced confessions and illegal search and seizure it also 
acknowledged that many of the cases were difficult to crack because 
those prosecuted were government workers 
china has acknowledged that torture and other breaches of human 
rights were frequent during the 10year ultraleftist cultural 
revolution that ended in 1976 
little criticism has since been tolerated of the states internal 
security bureaus though lawyers say several chinese have recently 
sued the police for wrongful arrest and won later this year the 
government is expected to come out with legislation allowing 
citizens to sue other government bureaus 
chinese lawyers say they are working to raise peoples 
consciousness of their rights recent cases such as that of two 
models who sued the prestigious central academy of fine arts are 
being widely publicized to teach people about invasion of privacy 
and other rights 
the models are suing because they said the academy used pictures 
of them in an exhibition of nudes without asking their permission 
the case has yet to be decided 
discussion of rights breaks down however when political 
freedoms are raised the government clearly states that no criticism 
of the communist party or socialism is allowed 
we are trying to set a foundation said one lawyer in a 
recent interview it would be asking too much for china to grant 
political freedoms at this point

rioting that left at least three blacks dead came as 
miami was trying to absorb 200 asylumseeking nicaraguans a day and 
coincided with the citys hopes to polish its tarnished image with 
the super bowl 
tensions have been simmering among some blacks over what they 
perceive as unjust treatment from police and feelings of frustration 
concerning the attention given to the nicaraguan newcomers 
community leaders said 
the hoopla over the super bowl with the city showing off its 
new skyline new bayside attractions and improved image may have 
added to the disaffection the fatal shooting of a 23yearold black 
motorcyclist by a white police officer monday evening provided the 
spark they said 
there have been a lot of other tensions the last few weeks 
they just needed a catalyst said state rep james burke who 
represents miami these people involved could care less about the 
super bowl being here its not going to help their lives 
the motorcyclists 24yearold passenger died tuesday afternoon 
and a young black man was shot to death early today as violence 
spread from the poor overtown section to liberty city about 30 
blocks to the northwest 
its really close to what happened before in 1980 said garth 
reeves longtime publisher of the blackoriented newspaper miami 
times referring to the acquittal of metrodade police officers 
charged with beating a black man to death the acquittals sparked 
three days of riots that killed 18 people and caused hundreds of 
millions of dollars in damage 
the outbreak of violence in 1980 came as 125000 cuban refugees 
were arriving in the mariel boatlift 
willie simms of the community relations board said the warning 
signs of this weeks violence were apparent he said his group keeps 
a weekly tension chart and had voiced alarm in recent weeks when 
it saw levels similar to 1980 and 1982 
but as in the past perceptions of violence likely will linger 
after the violence subsides 
this really puts a damper on literally hundreds of thousands of 
volunteer hours that have been put in by this community preparing 
for the sundays super bowl said tom ferguson president of the 
beacon council which promotes dade county 
its not that we have things that are any different from other 
urban areas its just that the timing of how they occur is 
absolutely incredible he added an incident like this you dont 
ever want to happen but its just doubly unfortunate that it 
happens this week 
houston post sports writer ray buck whose car windshield was 
shattered in monday nights violence said publicity about the 
violence will cancel out miamis hospitality this week 
unfortunately i think a lot of good effort was ruined in one 
short three or fourhour period he said a year of hard work 
went down the drain

the debut of the delta 2 space rocket 
next month and that of the powerful titan 4 a few weeks later 
highlight the air forces busiest launch year here since 1983 an 
official says 
the pentagon is counting on both rockets to help orbit a backlog 
of about 25 national defense payloads that have been grounded since 
the 1986 explosions of the space shuttle challenger and an unpiloted 
titan 34d rocket 
problems that have held up the two launches for months are being 
resolved air force col lawrence l gooch commander of the eastern 
space and missile center told reporters tuesday 
the delta 2 will carry two military navigation satellites on its 
first flight feb 7 and the titan 4 which will be americas most 
powerful expendable rocket will hoist a classified payload a few 
weeks later gooch said 
the 1989 launch schedule calls for seven military delta 2s two 
commercial delta 2s and one delta 1 two titan 4s two smaller titan 
34ds and two commercial titan 3s two commercial atlascentaurs and 
one with a navy communications satellite and six to eight submarine 
test launches of the navys powerful new trident 2 nuclear missile 
the missile center also will support seven national aeronautics 
and space administration space shuttle launchings during 1989 
starting with discovery on feb 23 
the schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since 
1983 when there were 60 there were 26 in 1987 
launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold the total 
down gooch said with luck we could support that rate but if we 
can get 70 percent up we will have earned our pay 
the air force decided to build the delta 2 and to significantly 
increase its titan 4 order after space shuttle challenger exploded 
on jan 26 1986 
the pentagon and nasa had been phasing out unpiloted rockets and 
had been putting all their launch eggs into one basket the shuttle 
the challenger disaster convinced officials that strategy had been a 
mistake and they ordered expendable rockets to ensure american 
access to space 
gooch estimated 40 military commercial and nasa space payloads 
have backed up as a result of the 32month standdown after the 
shuttle accident and because of the titan 34d grounding for several 
months about 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense 
he said 
cape canaveral range may have problems supporting the schedule if 
there are delays in a lot of the missions gooch said 
a shortage of people to handle launches could be another problem 
gooch said the colonel said he has asked the pentagon for about 100 
people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations group

journalists have taken the government to court over 
a ban on broadcast interviews with supporters of terrorist groups in 
northern ireland saying the order is unlawful and restricts the 
freedom of information 
permission to bring the suit before the high court was granted 
tuesday with some hesitation lord justice sir tasker watkins 
said the full court hearing is expected by march 
the ban ordered oct 19 by home secretary douglas hurd barred the 
british broadcasting corp and the independent broadcasting 
authority from carrying interviews with spokesmen for 11 groups 
including the ira and its legal wing sinn fein the ulster defense 
association and the ulster volunteer force 
the suit is the first court challenge to the ban and there have 
been no prosecutions for violating it 
hurds order issued after an upsurge of ira violence also 
banned the broadcast of words that supported or invited support 
for the banned organizations however broadcasters remained free 
to show pictures of the banned spokesmen and to paraphrase what they 
said 
the irish republican army is fighting to end british rule in 
protestantdominated northern ireland and unite the province with 
the irish republic which is predominantly roman catholic 
david pannick an attorney for the journalists and television 
producers who sought to challenge the ban argued that hurds order 
was illegal 
the directions are so perverse an interference with the free 
flow of information in a democratic society that this restriction on 
the freedom of expression is outside the discretionary powers which 
were conferred upon the secretary of state by parliament pannick 
said 
the court case is part of a campaign coordinated by the national 
union of journalists against the restrictions it is the main trade 
union representing press radio tv and magazine journalists in 
britain and ireland 
in november the american society of newspaper editors sent a 
letter to prime minister margaret thatcher protesting the ban 
at the time the ban was announced hurd made it clear that the 
ira and sinn fein were the primary targets and that his intention 
was to deny them publicity 
what people hear on television is not the sinn fein politicians 
being grilled by journalists what they hear is supporters of sinn 
fein glorying in violence and death that is what we propose to 
stop hurd said 
the challenge was brought by producers don brind of the bbc 
victoria leonard of the london broadcasting company and alexander

patrick e purdy was a child alcoholic 
drifting loner and gun lover but his grandmother says he had no 
racial prejudice or other known motive to drive him to fire on a 
crowded schoolyard with mostly oriental children 
julia chumbley believes the reason behind her grandsons assault 
may have died with him when he took his own life tuesday after using 
an assault rifle to kill five children and wound 29 others in 
stockton 15 miles south of here 
i dont understand why and i probably wont ever know why 
chumbley a 63yearold retired cannery worker told the associated 
press im shocked its just horrible 
despite a troubled childhood and a long criminal record as an 
adult purdy lacked racial prejudices against asians or other 
groups hatreds or other outward signs that might have foreshadowed 
the disaster according to his grandmother 
as far as i know he was not prejudiced were not a prejudiced 
family we werent raised that way said chumbley who has lived 
for three decades in this town in the farmingrich san joaquin 
valley 
when he was around here he acted well she said 
chumbley said her 26yearold grandson who also went by the 
alias patrick west had only a normal interest in guns 
all boys that age like guns she said its normal for that 
age isnt it 
purdys father patrick benjamin purdy a lodi cab company 
employee was killed in september 1981 when he was struck by a car 
as he was crossing a rural road the death disturbed the younger 
purdy but chumbley said he seemed to have recovered from the loss 
the elder purdy also served in vietnam which did not seem to 
have any apparent influence on the younger purdy she said 
chumbley also said that to her knowledge her grandson never 
attended cleveland elementary school where the attack took place a 
majority of the schools pupils are children of southeast asian 
refugees 
he seemed like a real nice young man said pat thomas 45 
who lives next door to purdys aunt in the portland ore suburb of 
sandy where the young man lived from july through october last 
year he was here looking for work 
but while purdy was in sandy last august he also purchased the 
ak47 assault rifle used in the rampage police said 
sandy police chief fred punzel said purdys aunt julie michael 
told him the gunman had a troubled upbringing a prelude to what 
stockton police described as an extensive criminal history 
including convictions for weapons narcotics and soliciting for sex 
she told me he was a loner and as a child he was an 
alcoholic punzel said 
purdy visited his grandmother about twice a year using her 
address to pick up his mail which included magazines on the welding 
trade 
she said his parents were married in stockton then divorced 
after a short time his mother remarried and took purdy to the lake 
tahoe nev region and then to the sacramento area 
he dropped out of high school and began drifting about 10 years 
ago crisscrossing the nation looking for work his grandmother 
said he visited her occasionally and used her address to receive 
mail 
punzel said mrs michael told him purdy left oregon for a job as 
a boilermaker in texas that job fell through and he went to 
memphis tenn 
the aunt and uncle last heard from purdy at thanksgiving when he 
was in connecticut punzel said 
he had a girlfriend for a time in stockton his grandmother said 
but that was some time ago she added 
early last year he began attending vocational classes in welding 
at san joaquin delta community college in stockton 
it troubles me to think that such a terrible thing can 
happen chumbley said its like a nightmare 
in a weary voice she added this is the sort of thing that 
happens to others not to you your own grandson

a weary and frustrated mayor xavier suarez is 
reaching out to blacks in an attempt to stem the violence and 
tension that has fractured his city for two days 
suarez promised an intensive investigation into the fatal 
shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a white hispanic police 
officer monday which triggered the wave of gunfire lootings and 
arson in the citys overtown and liberty city districts 
we will not rest until we come to the bottom of what happened 
to spark this riot said suarez in a televised appeal for calm 
tuesday night we must curb our anger with restraint we must turn 
our fear into strength for our families and our city 
his appeal came after the apparent failure of a police strategy 
to end the riots by avoiding major confrontations with angry blacks 
in overtown on monday night 
but despite a tranquil morning in overtown violence was renewed 
tuesday night and spread to liberty city where a young black man 
was fatally shot and six other people were wounded 
minutes after mondays fatal shooting suarez attempted to 
intervene between police and an angry crowd 
at one point he walked up to a hostile crowd that had gathered 
near the body of the dead motorcyclist and asked for calm but his 
efforts were met with a shower of rocks and bottles 
city manager cesar odio watching with police down the street 
told an officer somebody go get him hes crazy but suarez 
stood his ground and promised the angry gathering i promise you 
to look into this i will get to the bottom of this 
when the 39yearold suarez was reelected to his second twoyear 
term he claimed 62 percent of the vote and a majority among the 
citys three major groups englishspeaking whites hispanics and 
blacks 
he saw the vote as a sign of better relations between the three 
groups 
he points to his efforts to provide affordable housing projects 
in overtown the building of the nearby miami arena and his frequent 
visits to the overtown community as signs of progress 
the cubanborn suarez grew up in washington dc and moved to 
miami in 1975 he ran unsuccessfully for the city commission and for 
mayor before his election in 1985 he runs as an independent but he 
is a strong supporter of presidentelect bush 
suarez is an attorney with a law degree from harvard the married 
father of four has been described in national publications as sign 
that the cuban immigrants are coming of age in america 
but bill perry former leader of the greater miami national 
association for the advancement of colored people said a year ago 
that the cubans gain could be perceived as the blacks loss unless 
suarez does more to build unity 
and on tuesday suarez was defending his record in the black 
community and looking for a way out of the nightmare sparked by the 
police shooting 
overtown was neglected but now is the area in which the city 
has been making its greatest effort with the largest urban renewal 
project affordable housing possibly in the entire nation he 
said

a jury may convict joel steinberg of beating his 
illegally adopted daughter to death even if they find he did not 
strike the fatal blow the trial judge said 
state supreme court justice harold rothwax said tuesday if the 
jurors find steinberg was aware the child was injured and in danger 
and that she died as a result of action or inaction by him then 
they may convict him of murder 
steinberg 47 a disbarred millionaire lawyer is charged with 
seconddegree murder in the beating death of 6yearold lisa 
steinberg the girl he illegally obtained at birth from an unwed 
teen and raised as his own 
the child was removed unconscious from his greenwich village 
apartment on nov 2 1987 she died of a brain injury three days 
later at a nearby hospital 
the prosecution charges steinberg hit the girl but even if he 
killed her unintentionally he acted recklessly and showed a 
depraved indifference to her life by allowing her to lie 
unconscious for 12 hours without seeking help 
the judge said he will submit for the jurys consideration the 
four homicide counts available in this state they are seconddegree 
murder firstand seconddegree manslaughter and criminally 
negligent homicide 
the judge denied defense motions to throw out the homicide 
charges saying there was sufficient evidence to sustain them 
defense lawyer adrian diluzio asked rothwax to drop the charges 
on the ground that the only evidence implicating steinberg in the 
childs death came from an accomplice hedda nussbaum steinbergs 
former livein companion 
i will charge that hedda nussbaum is an accomplice as a matter 
of law in the death of lisa rothwax said this means the panel 
may consider her testimony only if there is corroborating 
supporting evidence 
it seems to me there is ample corroboration of the accomplice 
testimony in this case the judge said and the motion to 
dismiss those counts on that ground will be denied 
rothwax granted a defense motion to drop the endangering the 
welfare of a child charge with respect to lisa im disinclined to 
submit that count to the jury he said 
he called the charge a distraction and said steinberg has 
already served more than the oneyear maximum for that count anyway 
since he has been held without bail since november 1987 
the prosecution and defense have rested in the case and the 
defense is expected to give closing arguments on thursday the 
prosecution will sum up on friday and rothwax will give his final 
instructions to the jurors on monday just before they begin 
deliberating 
rothwax cautioned steinbergs lawyers against saying anything in 
summation that sounds like an insanity defense 
you can call it insanity or you can call it vanilla rothwax 
said warning that he will reopen the trial now in its 12th week 
and allow the prosecution psychiatrist to testify about his 
interviews last week with steinberg if defense lawyers say anything 
that smacks of an insanity defense 
we have no intention of arguing insanity diluzio said 
the judge also said he will tell the jurors that he allowed them 
to see and hear evidence that ms nussbaum 46 a former childrens 
book editor was battered by steinberg only so they could assess her 
state of mind at the time of lisas death and evaluate her testimony 
accordingly

lloyd m bentsen sr a rancher who 
returned from world war i with 150 in his pocket and forged a 
multimilliondollar empire was remembered as a pioneer and 
entrepreneur following his death at age 95 in a car crash 
he was part of this valley he loved this valley his son 
sen lloyd bentsen jr said upon arriving tuesday night from 
washington 
bentsen was pronounced dead at the scene of tuesday mornings 
accident at a rural intersection of hidalgo county in the lower rio 
grande valley said texas department of public safety spokesman 
david wells 
gov william clements called bentsen a great texas entrepreneur 
who contributed much to the people of our state particularly those 
in south texas 
bentsen was an entrepreneur whose leadership and character have 
long since made him a legend in texas texas has lost a true pioneer 
and a great citizen added sen phil gramm rtexas 
bentsen remained active with his farming ranching and real 
estate interests until his death and showed no physical evidence of 
the two times in his long career he was trampled by stampeding 
cattle 
he was here two or three times a week sometimes every day 
said bud williams foreman for the past 25 years at bentsens 
16000acre la coma ranch in hidalgo county one of six ranches 
bentsen owned 
bentsen held nearly 50000 acres of farms and ranches scattered 
on a south texas empire he began carving out of brush near the 
mexican border in 1920 
he was on the stage during part of last summers democratic 
national convention where his son was named the partys vice 
presidential candidate 
the senior bentsen was one of six children of danish parents who 
settled before the turn of the century on a small south dakota farm 
he had little time as a child for school and none at all after 
age 13 when he followed the grain harvest across iowa nebraska and 
the dakotas 
the incidental injuries in breaking wild horses were nothing 
compared to a motorcycle accident in 1915 in which bentsen broke 
several bones and almost lost his life 
after months of treatment he fled the hospital and following 
several rejections eventually tricked a drunken recruiting officer 
into enlisting him in the army 
in 1920 bentsen returned from the war and persuaded edna ruth 
colbath his dolly to marry him he had 150 in his pocket 
after the wedding he borrowed 500 and began building his empire

treated and released and his sister margarita 19 who required 
facial surgery was in stable condition at mission hospital 
hospital officials said

1977 had three children kenneth a houston architect don a 
mcallen businessman and betty wife of lower rio grande valley 
businessman dan winn

a record number of community hospitals closed for 
the sixth year in a row last year the american hospital association 
said promising to fight any further cuts in federal medicare and 
medicaid funding 
eightyone hospitals in 28 states shut down in 1988 the 
organization said tuesday the southwest was hardest hit with 18 
closings in texas alone 
in addition 21 noncommunity hospitals closed in 15 states the 
association said 
community hospitals are generally defined as those not serving a 
specific group like a university military base or prison they can 
be publicly or privately owned noncommunity hospitals typically 
provide rehabilitative or longterm care 
the closings were primarily due to inadequate medicare and 
medicaid payments for treatment of the elderly and poor said 
association president carol mccarthy 
hospitals cannot lose money or barely break even year after 
year and remain open ms mccarthy said its just that simple 
she said the association would pull out all the stops to stop 
cuts in medicare and improve health care funding for americas 
indigent 
since 1980 445 community hospitals have closed and the number 
has increased steadily since 1982 the association said 
fortythree of the 81 community hospitals that closed in 1988 
were rural 
for the last several years seven out of 10 rural hospitals and 
50 percent of urban hospitals have lost money caring for patients 
ms mccarthy said 
for most hospitals profit margins are disappearing and they 
cannot cut costs to stay open said association vice president 
alexander williams 
the problem is not excess expenses williams said the ones 
that close have gone through draconian cost cutting measures the 
problem is one of revenue

prosecutors said today that they have 
begun a criminal investigation of a bavarian firm that a news 
magazine says helped libya develop the ability for inflight 
refueling of warplanes 
munich prosecutor heinz stocker said the intec technical trade 
and logistic company was suspected of violating west germanys 
export laws 
he said the probe was focusing on whether fuel tank equipment 
sent to libya required an export permit 
we dont know what was done with this equipment in libya that 
is something that must be examined stocker told the associated 
press in a telephone interview he did not elaborate on the 
equipment sent to libya and said he could not give out other details 
it was not immediately clear whether investigators were also 
looking into a report by der spiegel magazine that intec engineers 
had helped refit libyan warplanes so they can be refueled in 
midflight 
prosecutors also did not say whether the investigation was at all 
related to the involvement by west german companies in the 
construction and outfitting of a suspected chemical weapons plant in 
libya 
der spiegel reported this week that 10 intechired engineers were 
playing a key role in helping libya fit warplanes and transport 
planes with equipment necessary for inflight refueling 
in addition to the construction of its own chemical weapons 
plant libya is reequipping its air force with the goal of 
increasing the operations radius of its bombers to as far away as 
jerusalem it said 
for over two years the german technicians have been involved 
in turning hercules transport planes into flying gas stations for 
libya spiegel said 
it alleged that intechired engineers are also equipping libyan 
warplanes with the special devices needed for midair refueling 
the hamburgbased magazine said the work has been going on at a 
tightly guarded air base near tripoli 
spiegel quoted an official with the bavarian firm as denying the 
company was guilty of any wrongdoing intec has nothing to do with 
construction work on airplanes in libya the magazine quoted ingo 
moehring as saying 
moehring is the son of eberhard moehring identifed by spiegel as 
owner of the bavarian firm ingo moehring said the company last year 
had only delivered metal rivets and nuts to libya spiegel

intec is based in vatterstetten which is located near munich

seven us airlines that fly boeing 737s 
similar to the british midland airways airliner that crashed jan 8 
in england say they found no wiring problems during inspections 
ordered by the federal aviation administration 
but one airline conducting an unrelated inspection found other 
wiring foulups in two larger boeing 757 aircraft faa officials in 
seattle said they were concerned about an apparent delay in 
reporting the problem in another case 
officials of america west continental delta piedmont 
southwest united and us air said tuesday that all their 737300s 
had been checked and no crosswiring or other problem was found in 
engine warning systems 
the 737 inspections resulted from speculation that crosedwiring 
might have misled the pilot of the british midland jet to shut down 
his good right engine after the left one caught fire officials have 
yet to determine the cause of the crash which killed 44 people but 
they say they found no evidence of a problem with the right engine 
except that it had been shut down 
american and aloha airlines officials did not immediately respond 
to inquiries about the testing but faa spokesman bob buckhorn said 
it appeared there were no problems with any of the airlines covered 
by the airworthiness directive he said however the faa had 
not yet compiled all the reports from airlines 
delta air lines responding to another faa order covering fire 
sprinkler systems in boeing 757 cargo holds said tuesday it found 
faulty wiring in two of its aircraft that brings to seven the total 
number of 757s found with such problems worldwide 
one case of faulty wiring in a 757 was reported to boeing in 
august by royal brunei airlines but boeing relayed the information 
to the faa only this month mitch barker of the agencys seattle 
office told the seattle postintelligencer 
boeing is under an obligation to look into these types of 
things and report them to the faa barker said tuesday theres 
some leeway in the process but if there is a long delay that would 
be a concern to us 
the reporting delay was a blip said david jiminez of boeing 
it was a breakdown in communication generally both manufacturer 
and carrier report to the faa but in this case it just didnt 
happen 
faa orders cover only domestic airliners but foreign carriers 
using us built aircraft generally comply with any safety 
inspections ordered 
were looking to see what happened in the system to allow this 
faulty wiring to happen where it happened how it happened and 
to see how we can make it not happen again said boeing spokesman 
tom cole in seattle 
cole said officials would not take any steps affecting production 
of new 757s until they received the results of the inspections from 
the faa 
the faa orders covering 737s and 757s were not related except 
that they both involved crosswiring 
the cargohold problems have been reported in another 
deltaoperated 757 one belonging to royal brunei airlines two 
owned by air holland and one operated by the british airline air 
2000 one of the air holland planes was being used by a charter 
company in canada 
officials of eastern which operates 25 of the 757s northwest 
which has 33 and america west which has seven said tuesday that 
they found no problems with any of their planes no other us 
airline operates the 757 
jim lundy a delta spokesman in atlanta said the carrier 
immediately notified the faa of the latest two cases and corrected 
the problems which would have prevented sprinklers from working 
properly in the event of a fire in a baggage hold 
one airplane had a crossedwiring problem that would have turned 
on the wrong sprinklers if a fire had broken out lundy said the 
other had faulty wiring that would have warned the pilot of a fire 
but would not have activated the sprinklers he said 
he said it was a similar crossedwiring problem found on a delta 
plane before delivery from the boeing factory that prompted the faa 
757 airworthiness directive last week 
airlines had until tuesday morning to complete the inspections 
and regular airline service was not affected officials said

foreign minister jaromir johanes of 
czechoslovakia today dismissed harsh western criticism of a police 
crackdown on dissidents in prague and said the demonstrators had 
broken the law by assembling 
anyone in this hall who wants to point the finger at other 
nations including czechoslovakia should first of all look at 
himself johanes said 
acts in breach of legal and public order cannot be tolerated by 
any government he said departing from his prepared text laws 
have to be observed by all 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze meanwhile said upon 
arriving in vienna that the berlin wall is not a subject for 
negotiations at the conference in vienna on human rights and 
eastwest relations 
shevardnadze scheduled to address the final session of the 
35nation conference on thursday also told reporters there are 
many areas in which east and west just disagree on human 
rights issues 
johanes spoke a day after police armed with truncheons broke up 
crowds of protesters in pragues wenceslas square for a third day 
chasing hundreds of youths with water cannons 
on sunday police used tear gas batons dogs and water cannons 
to break up 5000 demonstrators gathered to remember jan palach a 
czech student who killed himself in 1969 to protest the 1968 
sovietled invasion of his homeland 
on monday 14 prominent dissidents including banned playwright 
vaclav havel were detained after they tried to lay flowers in 
palachs memory 
havel charter 77 spokespersons dana nemcova and sasha vondra and 
the other 11 activists remained in detention today 
in an interview with austrian radio after his speech johanes 
said what is happening in prague is not a violation of human 
rights 
asked what he meant by his comment that other countries should 
look at their own rights records johanes cited as an example the 
wave of arrests in miami in the past two days following rioting by 
blacks there 
us secretary of state george p shultz and british foreign 
secretary sir geoffrey howe strongly criticized the czechoslovak 
police action tuesday the first day of a threeday meeting of the 
foreign ministers from the 35 nations to wrap up new accords on 
human rights and security 
shultz said czechoslovakia violated the new accords just one hour 
after they were formally adopted sunday by delegates who worked 27 
months to draft them shultz however praised the soviet union 
hungary and poland for recent economic and political reforms 
polish foreign minister tadeusz olechowski speaking after his 
countrys communist leaders set conditions for legalizing 
solidarity pledged his country would fully adhere to the accords 
reached in vienna 
i can assure you that poland will scrupulously implement all 
the obligations which she has assumed olechowski said 
we shall review the existing legislation to see whether it is 
consistent with these new recommendations and where it is not to 
introduce the necessary amendments we shall expect similar moves by 
other states he added 
johanes made no such pledge to review czechoslovak laws thus 
emphasizing the gap that opened up at the vienna conference between 
reformist nations in the soviet bloc and those more reluctant to 
change 
the accords call for new arms control talks between nato and the 
warsaw pact to reduce conventional arms across europe those 
negotiations are due to open in vienna march 9 
johanes said the new talks will become an important practical 
test of the political resolve to reach tangible progress toward 
disarmament 
shevardnadze was asked by reporters if the recently concluded 
agreement at the conference indicated the berlin wall could now be 
dismantled 
i dont think that the berlin wall is a subject for the vienna 
meeting he said each state has the right to build its 
frontiers as it wishes and we must proceeed from there

a developer is abandoning his 120 million 
penns landing mall and office project along the delaware river 
about three months before its scheduled groundbreaking calling it 
an expensive mistake 
willard rouse iii admitting deep regret and certainly 
embarrassment said tuesday he had received construction and 
marketing reports in the past three weeks showing rents in the first 
stage of development wouldnt balance costs 
the major problems were a nationwide slump in retailing and a 
glut of office space in philadelphia he said 
city officials were shocked by the announcement after three years 
of negotiations and lengthy city council hearings on the project on 
the waterfront where william penn and other english settlers landed 
more than 350 years ago 
we are very disappointed and surprised said city commerce 
director william p hankowsky things had been moving along very 
well 
plans called for a hotel and a parking garage in addition to 
offices and stores more buildings were contemplated in the next 
decade for an additional 400 million investment 
the city had pledged to provide up to 195 million in subsidies 
for the project and to pay 2 million a year for maintenance as part 
of a lease agreement on the cityowned tract rouse was to pay rent 
of 100000 a year plus a percentage of profits 
rouse had not signed the lease agreement but had been expected 
to do so by the end of this month hankowsky said 
the developer said it was more prudent to quit now even though 
he already has spent 5 million on the project 
it was an expensive mistake he told a news conference at his 
rouse and associates 21stfloor headquarters at one liberty place 
the citys tallest building which he completed last year it was a 
terribly challenging project we wanted to do and it will take a 
while to get over it 
groundbreaking was to begin before may 1 
asked the consequences for philadelphia rouse replied it 
leaves the city with a great piece of dirt 
hankowsky said city officials would reevaluate the penns 
landing plan and might negotiate with rouse to build part of the 
project or seek proposals from other developers

nations 41st president will be tight with all law enforcement 
officers throughout the area on duty following cancellation of all 
days off 
the 150000 invited guests at the capitol swearingin ceremonies 
will be screened by metal detectors even if theyll be sitting 
hundreds of yards away at the edge of the capitol lawn 
this is the first time those guests on the lawn will be screened 
so carefully and sen wendell ford dky chairman of the joint 
congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies says hes upset 
about the tightened regimen 
security is something that bothers me considerably he said

insisting that those in the inner circle go through megadetectors 
anyone going to any of the galas or anywhere else that the first 
families might be will also be checked with the magnetometers 
demonstrations by those who want to see changes in the 
administrations policies are planned throughout the ceremonies

set aside to ensure first amendment rights in the words of park

the city 
the counterinaugural coalition for a peoples agenda has 
scheduled everything from a union station banquet a soup 
kitchen to a no honeymoon benefit concert for the christic 
institute featuring david crosby and graham nash at the warner 
theater the national organization for women plans to protest 
silently all along the pennsylvania avenue parade route 
the manholes along pennsylvania avenue already have been welded 
shut but many other details of the security measures remain secret 
we certainly wouldnt want to give anyone who had harmful 
intent any kind of advantage said secret service spokesman ken 
lynch 
reports on previous inaugurations have indicated that agents 
carrying shoulderfired stinger missiles to protect against air 
attack were on the capitol roof will that be the case this year no 
comment say all the agencies involved 
bob buckhorn a federal aviation administration spokesman noted 
only that flying over the white house or the capitol is a violation 
of federal air regulations 
in past inaugurals bulletproof panels have protected the new 
president as he takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural 
address workers at the capitols west front were installing a 
bulletproof shield around the podium this week 
everybody willing to talk about it says bush will ride in an 
armored limousine as he travels from the capitol to the white house 
following the oathtaking but then thats what they said about 
president jimmy carter before he and his wife rosalynn climbed out 
of their car and marched the 1 miles down pennsylvania avenue in 
january 1977 
jody powell carters press secretary says carter told him about 
his plans the week before the inauguration but the news was very 
tightly held for security purposes 
what he told me at the time was the deal was the secret service 
wasnt going to fight it as long as it was kept secret but if word 
got out ahead of time theyd be very opposed to it powell said 
secret service spokesman rich adams says his agency will be 
prepared to protect bush if he decides to stroll down pennsylvania 
avenue but he admitted the service would not be too happy about it 
if we had our way he would not leave the white house he 
said 
law enforcement agencies involved in security for the inaugural 
ceremonies include the secret service capitol police the local 
police department metro transit police park police federal 
protective service and the district of columbia national guard in

communist leaders passed a resolution early 
today that could restore solidaritys legal status but officials of 
the banned trade union movement said too many unacceptable 
conditions appeared to be attached 
among conditions set before todays vote by the partys governing 
central committee was that solidarity declare itself in favor of 
socialism promise no strikes for two years and forfeit financial 
assistance from the west 
there was no immediate comment from solidarity leader lech 
walesa an aide said he would hold a news conference thursday 
prime minister mieczyslaw f rakowski said during debate tuesday 
he favored ending the sevenyear ban on solidarity if its leaders 
promised not to drag the economically depressed country into 
anarchy 
the official pap news agency said today a majority of the 
230member central committee had approved the party leaderships 
stand on trade union and political pluralism other details of the 
proposal debated 17 hours until 3 am were not immediately 
available 
the vote occurred too late to be included in morning newspapers 
and the text was not immediately carried by pap 
the central committee also gave an overwhelming vote of 
confidence to top party authorities led by first secretary wojciech 
jaruzelski pap reported unanimous approval with four abstentions 
a solidarity source in warsaw said rakowskis proposal to 
reinstate the only independent labor movement ever allowed in the 
soviet bloc appeared at first glance unclear unacceptable or 
even laughable 
the source speaking on condition of anonymity said solidarity 
could not function as a free trade union if forced to embrace an 
ideology and stripped of the right to strike 
rakowski said the government needed assurances that a legally 
functioning solidarity would differ from the movement that used 
general strike threats as a pressure tactic during its 16month 
heyday which began in 1980 the organization was outlawed in 1982 
solidarity activists on tuesday welcomed the shift in the partys 
stance but said they must proceed with caution because authorities 
had acted out of necessity rather than good will 
the authorities will do whatever that have to do to stay on 
top lets wait and see what they have to say and read the fine 
print carefully said maciej jankowski a solidarity leader at 
warsaw university 
jaruzelski crushed solidarity in a december 1981 military 
crackdown interning thousands of activists and banning the movement 
the next year 
after a series of spring and summer strikes demanding higher pay 
and solidaritys reinstatement jaruzelski agreed to resume contacts 
with the movement however promised negotiations with the 
opposition were repeatedly delayed over conditions set by both sides 
walesa has warned that the public mood is reaching the boiling 
point because of rising prices and annoying consumer shortages 
in the latest sign of tension a strike for higher pay and 
legalization of solidarity on tuesday shut down the 1100worker 
pabianice fabric works in the textile city of lodz 
under the proposal rakowski put to the central committee final 
legalization of solidarity would follow a twoyear probationary 
period lasting until may 3 1991 the 200th anniversary of the 
adoption of a progressive constitution that imperial russia quickly 
invalidated by force 
we have to gain certainty that this solidarity which cannot be 
a simple repetition of the old one does not pull the country into 
anarchy rakowski said 
rakowski addressed specific questions to solidarity in his 
speech saying the answers would determine if the union could be a 
partner or whether it would remain a political opponent 
he asked what position solidarity would take toward 
anticommunist polish groups like the confederation for an 
independent poland and whether it would continue to take money from 
the us congress and other foreign organizations 
the us government has granted solidarity 1 million a year the 
last two years but polish authorities have held up spending of half 
of this total us aid to solidarity was estimated last year at 5 
million by the new york times 
solidarity does not deny receiving foreign help walesa said he 
would take money from the kremlin if he could use it to defend trade 
union freedoms 
rakowski stressed that the economy would be the most important 
factor for poland during the next few years 
it above all needs order and peace he said even the best 
administration methods and solutions will not meet our hopes if the 
economy becomes a field of political struggles

as might have been expected when a 
bumbling bank robber dropped his loot on the street a crowd quickly 
gathered to grab what was blowing in the wind 
what might not have been expected was that the bystanders 
returned almost all the money to the bank 
i think its wonderful when citizens are willing to step in and 
help police sgt dan castellini said of tuesdays incident im 
not sure theres anything pleasant about a robbery but when you 
see something positive happen you cant help but have a smile on 
your face 
all but 20 of the 2900 taken from redlands federal savings was 
returned castellini said he said the missing 20 bill probably 
blew away before anyone could grab it 
police said the incident began at 948 am when a man walked 
into the bank and handed a teller a bag and a note demanding money 
after receiving the filled bag the man fled but dropped the bag 
almost as soon as he got outside rather than stop to retrieve it 
he kept on running leaving the money to scatter in the wind 
the robber escaped in the commotion castellini said

psychiatric experts said today 
that confessed hijacker mohammed ali hamadi is mentally competent to 
stand trial despite head wounds he received during fighting in his 
native beirut 
hamadi is charged with air piracy and murder in the june 14 1985 
hijacking of a twa jetliner in which us navy diver robert stethem 
was slain hamadi admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied 
killing stethem 
following the seizure of the athenstorome flight 39 americans 
were held hostage for 17 days 
the frankfurt court acting on a defense request in november 
ordered psychiatric tests for hamadi after it was revealed in court 
testimony that he had received head wounds in fighting in beirut 
where a civil war has raged for 13 years 
willi schumacher and hasso sachs professors of psychiatry at 
giessen university 35 miles north of frankfurt testified today on 
the results of their tests of hamadi 
schumacher said hamadis mental processes are quick coherent 
and concise his head has some scars but none of them is 
sensitive to outside pressure schumacher said 
he said the defendants reflexes were normal and that hamadi had 
no coordination problems 
mr hamadi is in all respects mentally fit schumacher said 
sachs said he tested hamadi for mental disturbances intellectual 
development and concentration he described the defendant as 
orderly thinking and stable 
he was friendly courteous cooperative absolutely not 
withdrawn sachs said 
sachs said his tests showed hamadi was of average intelligence 
and that cerebal damage could not be established indicating a 
fully healthy brain 
following the psychiatrists testimony the defense asked that 
hamadi be given additional tests chief judge heiner mueckenberger 
did not immediately rule on the request 
the trial which began july 5 resumed this week after a break of 
nearly one month 
hamadi has been kept in frankfurts preungesheim prison since his 
arrest at the citys airport jan 23 1987 he was arrested after 
being caught with liquid explosives in his luggage 
the united states requested his extradition but following the 
kidnapping of two west germans in beirut west germany said he would 
be tried here instead 
hamadis brother abbas hamadi was sentenced by a duesseldorf 
court in april to 13 years in prison for his part in kidnapping the 
west germans allegedly to win mohammeds freedom 
the two west germans have since been freed

us oil imports last year jumped to the 
highest level since 1979 as consumption rose and domestic production 
hit a 12year low an industry trade group said today 
the american petroleum institute representing the major oil 
producers and refiners said us oil production fell to 81 million 
barrels a day a nearly 3 percent drop from 1987 
the rate was the lowest since 1976 the year before production 
began at the giant prudhoe bay oil field on the north slope of 
alaska 
oil production in the 48 contiguous states last year was the 
lowest since 1950 the group said 
imports of oil surged to a rate of 72 million barrels a day a 
nearly 9 percent increase over 1987 the record peak for oil imports 
was 88 million barrels a day in 1977 two years before the iranian 
revolution sparked the secon oil crisis of the decade 
the rise in imports and drop in domestic production highlight 
what the independent mostly smaller us oil producers say is an 
urgent need for congress to adopt some form of legislation to 
protect the industry from cheap foreign oil 
one proposal likely to face the new congress is a fee on imported 
oil which proponents say would curb the trend toward higher imports 
and lower domestic output the american petroleum institute has not 
taken an official position on this issue 
the institutes latest report said total us energy use last 
year rose to the highest level ever to 80 quads a standard measure 
of energy consumption that is equal to a quadrillion british thermal 
units one btu is defined as the amount of heat required to raise 
the temperature of one pound of water by one degree fahrenheit 
despite the rise in overall energy use oils share of total 
consumption continued to decline to 42 percent compared with 43 
percent in 1987 and 49 percent in 1977 
use of electricity coal and natural gas all rose by about 5 
percent last year the report said 
gasoline consumption continued an upward trend last year but at 
a slower rate than in recent years use rose 16 percent in 1988 
which the trade organization attributed in part to a general decline 
in retail gasoline prices in recent years consumption had risen 24 
percent in 1987 and 3 percent the year before

defense minister yitzhak rabin was shouted off 
the podium in parliament today by leftwing legislators when he 
tried to defend tougher tactics for putting down the palestinian 
uprising 
rightwing critics of the government said it was not doing enough 
to end the revolt against israels 21year occupation of the west 
bank and gaza strip 
the army closed palestinian schools in four west bank cities for 
three days and three others for 10 days the closures were aimed at 
stopping the violence that has taken the lives of at least 13 
teenagers in the past week the army said 
in violence today two palestinian teenagers were wounded in a 
clash with troops in hebron in the occupied west bank arab news 
reports said 
an israeli driver and a palestinian passenger suffered minor 
injuries when a firebomb was thrown at a bus near the west bank city 
of ramallah israel radio reported 
rabin came under fire in the legislature for his latest policy of 
allowing troops to shoot plastic or rubber bullets at stonethrowers 
even as they flee and for expanding the number of troops allowed to 
shoot 
plastic and rubber bullets were introduced as a less lethal 
method of quelling riots than live ammunition but they have been 
blamed for several deaths including eight of the teenagers killed 
in the past week 
three deaths tuesday brought the number of palestinians killed in 
the 13month uprising to 362 fifteen israelis have died 
another part of the new policy calls for punishing stonethrowers 
by wrecking or sealing their homes or confiscating their families 
property 
as long as the residents of the occupied territories arent 
ready to sit down at the negotiating table as long as they respond 
with violence rocks and bottles they will not make us run away 
they will not make us surrender they will suffer rabin said 
hecklers interrupted him at least a dozen times before he stopped 
speaking and angrily took his seat some critics called for his 
resignation 
one detractor yossi sarid of the leftwing citizens rights 
movement said this policy is not only killing palestinians but 
also the souls of israeli soldiers i say to you that for the sake 
of our future and our common destiny ours and the palestinians 
i say to you mr defense minister go 
the debate followed the introduction of noconfidence motions by 
eight factions against the governments handling of the latest 
violence 
rehavam zeevi of the ultranationalist homeland party which 
seeks the expulsion of arabs from israel and the occupied lands 
represented one of three parties that criticized rabin for not going 
far enough 
children and teenagers are running wild in the villages and on 
the roads for them its a festival for us a continuous yom 
kippur the jewish day of atonement zeevi said there is no 
justification for this 
the cabinet which includes the rightwing likud bloc and the 
leftleaning labor party was expected to easily defeat the 
noconfidence motions from the small parties 
also today police fired rubber bullets to quell one disturbance 
at a high school in arab east jerusalem and detained eight 
demonstrators police spokesman rafi levy said 
an army statement said most of the school closures were meant to 
prevent further violence and thwart student plans to stage strikes 
for reasons that have nothing to do with education such as house 
demolitions 
in line with the new army policy soldiers tuesday dynamited 
three homes of palestinians in the west bank town of qalqiliya 
palestinian merchants closed their shops and public 
transportation came to a halt in jenin ramallah qalqilya and arab 
east jerusalem in protest of the latest demolitions and the rash of 
deaths arab reports said

despite warnings from other justice department 
officials former attorney general edwin meese iii remained blind to 
ethical problems raised by his actions on behalf of lobbyist e 
robert wallach the justice department says 
the report issued tuesday concludes that meese violated federal 
ethics standards an attachment to the report shows more than 600 
contacts between meese and the san francisco lawyer from the time 
the reagan administration came to power 
meeses assistance to scandalplagued wedtech corp in 1981 and 
1983 and his efforts on behalf of a proposed mideast oil pipeline in 
1985 were three instances in which his friendship with wallach 
dictated federal actions said the report by the departments 
office of professional responsibility 
wallach who collected 13 million from wedtech from 1982 to 
1986 is awaiting trial in new york on racketeering and other 
charges he is accused of peddling his connection to meese 
white house spokesmen marlin fitzwater said president reagan 
believes that meese his longtime friend had done nothing wrong 
and he said this report was unnecessary partly because mr meese 
has not been in the office for some time and partly because it was 
unwarranted 
thendeputy attorney general arnold burns and criminal division 
chief william weld recognized the impropriety of mr wallachs 
activities and advised mr meese to repudiate them said the 
report but meese continued to meet with wallach and receive letters 
and memos from him as he had since 1981 
burns and weld resigned last march to protest meeses continued 
tenure at the department while he was under criminal investigation 
despite the ability of others to perceive potential problems 
with mr wallachs actions mr meese remained blind to them and 
made no effort to distance himself from mr wallach the ethics 
report concluded 
it said that other people who werent even close to meese could 
recognize problems with mr wallachs actions and that certainly 
mr meeses internal warning bell should have gone off 
the report is especially critical of meeses actions in 
connection with the oil pipeline in which meese arranged a meeting 
between thennational security adviser robert mcfarlane wallach and 
wallachs client swiss oilman bruce rappaport at the time meese 
was liable for legal fees to wallach who had represented him in a 
criminal investigation in 1984 
mr meese knew when he became involved in the pipeline matter 
that mr wallach had a financial interest in the project and that he 
was potentially liable to mr wallach for more than 142000 in 
legal fees said the report despite this knowledge mr meese 
acceded to mr wallachs request that he call mr mcfarlane 
wallachs fees eventually were paid by the government 
meese spokesman patrick korten complained that the report had an 
emotional undertone about meese that was designed to slam him 
personally 
george walker an attorney for wallach said wallach and meese 
both had acted properly and called the departments report old 
news 
walker said wallach simply asked meese to ensure that wedtech was 
being treated fairly in connection with a 32 million army engine 
contract and that meese didnt participate in resolving a 1983 
problem involving financing for the company wedtech eventually was 
awarded the nobid contract 
walker said in regard to the more than 600 contacts between 
wallach and meese that wallach put all this in writing we know 
theres nothing wrong 
but the opr report said that many letters and memos contain a 
strong undercurrent in which wallach is seeking action from 
meese and his staff on matters in which wallach had a financial 
interest 
mr wallach traded on his ability to invoke mr meeses 
authority to facilitate achieving the ends he sought the report 
said mr meese it appears was at best oblivious to mr 
wallachs method of operation 
meeses successor as attorney general dick thornburgh tried to 
avoid characterizing the opr report in any way but ultimately 
disagreed with one of its conclusions while saying the others were 
adequately based on facts he said the report is a roadmap on 
how to respond to certain types of situations 
thornburgh disagreed with one conclusion that said meese violated 
ethical standards when he failed to sell 14000 in stock of 
regional telephone companies while participating in department 
decisions affecting them 
independent counsel james mckay decided last summer not to 
prosecute meese although mckay concluded meese had probably twice 
violated conflictofinterest laws in connection with his telephone 
holdings and had violated tax laws in connection with failing to 
report the stock sales 
the opr investigation involved ethical rather than criminal 
aspects of meeses actions

police broke into a church early today 
and dragged away a sri lankan who had taken refuge there and was 
sleeping handcuffed to a radiator his supporters said 
home office minister timothy renton said viraj mendis 32 would 
be sent back to sri lanka if he did not find another country to 
accept him by friday 
mendis says he faces persecution and possible death in his native 
country because of his communist beliefs and support for the tamil 
minority the british government and courts disagree 
the rev john methuen of the church of the ascension said police 
arrived at his home about 730 am and broke down the door leading 
to the vestry where mendis was staying with two supporters 
methuen said there was quite a lot of damage done to the 
building 
a home office spokesman confirmed that two immigration officers 
and 50 police officers forced their way into the church of england 
premises in northern england 
the door into the sacristy or vestry was a large wooden door 
which was heavily bolted and barred said terry platt head of the 
immigration and nationality section at the home office 
they forced that door with special equipment which had the 
result of doing some damage to the door and wall 
ingrid falat a member of the church council said mendis was 
handcuffed to the radiator in the room they dragged him out by 
his hands and feet 
falat and other witnesses said the police used acetylene torches 
to remove the handcuffs 
mendis has lost two immigration appeals a high court judicial 
review and a court of appeal review of a deportation order issued in 
december 1986 
last month britains highest court the law lords of the house 
of lords also refused to hear his case 
mendis took refuge in the church dec 20 1986 two days after 
home secretary douglas hurd the senior cabinet minister responsible 
for immigration signed the deportation order against him for 
overstaying in britain 
mendis was trying to revive the ancient right of sanctuary which 
dates back to the old testament and had a long tradition in britain 
until it was abolished by parliament in 1623 the medieval sanctuary 
at londons westminster abbey harbored so many people it was said to 
resemble a small town 
mendis came to britain in 1973 on a student visa to study at the 
university of manchester he ran into financial difficulties after 
two years dropped out went to work and joined a communist splinter 
group 
mendis is a member of sri lankas sinhalese majority but has 
actively supported the rights of the tamil minority tamil rebels 
are fighting for an independent homeland in sri lanka 
the sri lankan government have in the past given assurances 
that he is not wanted in sri lanka for any offense and is free to go 
there without impediment renton said in a statement 
we have always felt that the situation in sri lanka did not 
justify the position that mendis and his supporters were adopting

two cosmonauts who spent a year in space suffered 
fewer physical effects than expected and there do not appear to be 
any barriers to even longer missions soviet space specialists said 
today 
longer flights we believe are quite possible and we think 
they will be carried out anatoly grigoryev director of the 
institute of biomedical problems of the soviet health ministry 
told a news conference 
grigoryev said cosmonauts musa manarov and vladimir titov who 
returned to earth on dec 21 after a year in space suffered some 
atrophy of their calf muscles and some loss of calcium as have 
other cosmonauts 
but because of exercise and training developed by soviet 
scientists the effects suffered by manarov and tito were less 
severe than their predecessors he said 
titov manarov and french cosmonaut jeanloup chretien also 
attended the news conference chretien spent a month on the mir 
orbiting space complex before returning with titov and manarov who 
hold the space endurance record 
titov said he and manarov noticed some atrophy of their leg 
muscles in the weightless conditions aboard the mir complex 
he said he had been afraid about the effects of the long period 
of weightlessness when he returned to earth but our ideas were 
bleaker than reality we feel quite well better than expected 
scientists said results of tests done on titov and manarov still 
are being analyzed 
in response to a reporters question alexander dunayev head of 
the glavkosmos space agency said soviet officials still had not 
decided whether the second flight of the space shuttle buran will be 
manned or unmanned 
he said technological and economic disagreements about burans 
next flight had not been settled and that a date for the second 
flight was not set 
glavkosmos is the space agency charged with development of space 
engineering for the economy 
buran was launched nov 15 on a threehour 20 minute unmanned 
flight but the soviet press has referred several times to an 
internal debate about the shuttle program soviet space officials 
for years scorned the us shuttle program as inefficient before 
unveiling a similarlooking craft

cocaine sparking concern among doctors who reported an increase in

whom were from the inner city the study found that 18 percent had 
used cocaine at least once during pregnancy the boston herald

took the drug three or more times a week 
zuckerman said he expects to complete the study in six months he 
is analyzing the data to determine the impact of cocaine use on 
developing fetuses 
we were actually studying the effects of marijuana during

president reagan said today the request of 
newspaper heiress patty hearst shaw for a pardon has not come to his 
desk for attention and an administration official cautioned against 
expecting any too extraordinary pardons during reagans final 
days in office 
there are always pardons coming across my desk from the justice 
department reagan told reporters 
asked specifically about mrs shaw convicted for her role in a 
san francisco bank robbery 14 years ago the president said no 
that hasnt come to my desk for attention yet 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there are pardons 
that are in the system but i dont have any status report on 
whether or not he has had a chance to review them 
a senior official speaking on condition he not be identified 
said reagan has pardoned 10 people in the last few weeks through the 
normal process in which they are announced by the courts rather 
than the white house 
my private guidance is not to expect anything too extraordinary 
here in the form of pardons the official said he added however 
that reagan has not made final decisions and i can never preempt 
the president 
the official said former national security aide oliver l north 
mrs shaw and industrialist armand hammer were in the category of 
potential pardon recipients he had in mind as extraordinary 
with time running out on his twoterm presidency reagan has as 
many as a couple of dozen requests still pending said the source 
who declined to be publicly identified 
mrs shaw 34 said earlier this week that she did not know if 
reagans expression of interest in her case means she stands a good 
chance of being pardoned 
reagan has been reluctant to discuss the subject of pardons 
although he did tell reporters sunday that i have asked everybody 
to look into the shaw case he has repeatedly said he plans no 
pardon for north who faces a trial on an array of charges related 
to the irancontra affair 
the administration source would not divulge the names of the 10 
pardon requests that reagan reviewed and referred back to the 
justice department there are no big names he said 
spokesman fitzwater had told reporters tuesday its certainly 
possible that a decision could be made on shaw before he leaves 
patty hearst was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for 
her role in the 1974 armed robbery of a san francisco bank she now 
is married and living in connecticut with her husband and two 
daughters under the married name of patty hearst shaw 
shaw granddaughter of newspaper tycoon william randolph hearst 
last august quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the robbery 
she has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical symbionese 
liberation army a group of revolutionaries who kidnapped her in 
berkeley calif in february 1974 and orchestrated the bank heist 
her sevenyear sentence was commuted by president carter and she 
was released from prison on feb 1 1979 after serving 23 months 
in an interview monday with the advocate of stamford at her 
westport conn home shaw said its a little premature for 
anything like that if he reagan doesnt approve it it would go 
to the next administration 
attention also is being given to a longstanding pardon request by 
hammer the los angeles industrialist and head of occidental 
petroleum corp he was fined 3000 and placed on a years probation 
in connection with his guilty plea to three misdemeanor charges in 
connection with the watergate scandal of the early 1970s 
fitzwater said that he would not comment on any individuals 
that are in this category some of them are recent some of them 
weve had for weeks or for months 
the administration official who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity said that the pardon approvals tend to trickle over 
we got 10 back from the white house approved last week 
under routine procedure the justice departments pardons office 
would contact the person receiving a pardon or that persons

federal racketeering charges were filed against 18 
former employees of a now defunct commodities brokerage firm accused 
of defrauding 2600 investors out of about 40 million 
the charges announced tuesday grew out of the largest 
investigation of its kind ever undertaken by the federal government 
according to us attorney anton valukas 
the 18 former chicago area employees of first commodity corp of 
boston all named in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury 
and in a criminal information were charged with 187 counts of 
racketeering racketeering conspiracy wire and mail fraud valukas 
said 
the companys former national vice president for sales two 
branch managers and 15 former salesmen from its chicago and suburban 
oak brook offices were accused of using highpressure tactics to 
persuade customers around the country to invest in highstakes 
commodity ventures misrepresented as lowrisk 
valukas said customers were solicited by first commodity sales 
representatives posing as commodities experts the representatives 
often made repeated phone calls using scripts handed out by 
managers he said 
investors were falsely told that commodity trading was not 
risky and would lead to high profits the prosecutor said 
in fact the defendants knew almost all of fccbs customers 
lost money 
during the time covered by the charges from 1980 to february 
1987 the chicago and oak brook offices had 100 million in sales 
of which 63 million was lost valukas said 
more than 406 million of those sales and more than 227 
million of the losses were attributable to the former employees 
named in the complaints valukas said 
he declined to say whether more charges were forthcoming but 
noted that the investigation is continuing in chicago boston new 
york miami and san francisco 
assistant us attorney michele smith said the probe was the 
largest of its type in several aspects including the number of 
victims 2600 named in tuesdays charges as well as 44400 other 
customers of the firm during the period of the alleged scheme 
allegations are that the entire company was operated under 
fraud she said today 
the 600 million raised by first commodity from 1980 to the 
firms collapse in february 1987 is alleged to have been 
fraudulently generated and is the largest sum involved in an alleged 
commodities fraud scheme she said 
more than 500 fbi agents the most ever in such a case have 
been involved in the probe ms smith said in november three 
former salesmen for the company pleaded guilty in the investigation 
and agreed to cooperate with federal agents 
first commodity was founded in the late 1970s and rapidly grew 
into one of the nations leading futures trading companies but it 
collapsed in 1987 under a mountain of investor lawsuits and federal 
investigations 
the newest defendants include david c connolly 48 of teaneck 
nj first commoditys former national sales vice president former 
oak brook branch manager ross a barnard 37 of suburban hinsdale 
and barnards brother stephen l barnard 38 of suburban 
flossmoor former house broker at the chicago office 
neither connolly nor the barnards could be reached for comment 
the barnards had unpublished numbers and connolly was not listed in 
the teaneck area 
if convicted the defendants could face lengthy prison terms and 
thousands of dollars in fines 
it is a sad reality that sophisticated and deceptive sales 
techniques can yield great profits to those willing to use them 
valukas said these cases should serve as a clear warning that 
fraud and deception in the offer and sale of commodity contracts 
in whatever form it takes will be thoroughly investigated and 
vigorously prosecuted

former philippines president ferdinand marcos is 
dying and should not face trial on charges he stole millions of 
dollars from his countrys treasury his lawyers said today 
attorney richard a hibey asserted that marcos was mortally ill 
after prosecutors dropped their demand that marcos come to new york 
for arraignment and asked instead that he be arraigned in honolulu 
they acknowledged that his recent hospitalization for pneumonia 
would delay any travel for more than a month 
marcos 71 who has been living in exile in honolulu since 1986 
is hospitalized there with pneumonia bronchitis and asthma 
according to assistant us attorney charles labella 
marcos his wife imelda 59 are accused of plundering 103 
million from the philippines treasury funneling it to foreign bank 
accounts and using it to buy prime new york real estate and art 
works 
from the time of his indictment in october marcos had asked that 
the arraignment be moved to hawaii citing various health problems 
including kidney and heart ailments a government doctor however 
after examining marcos there had pronounced him capable of 
traveling to new york for arraignment 
labella requested the court session after hibey asked us 
district judge john keenan to turn a hearing on marcos ability to 
travel to new york for arraignment into one on whether he was 
physically competent to ever stand trial 
what began as merely a request to hold mr marcos arraignment 
in honolulu rather than new york has evolved into a genuine concern 
for his life hibey wrote the judge in a threepage letter dated 
tuesday that included an abbreviated doctors report 
we have been advised by the last doctor who examined president 
marcos that he is dying hibeys letter concluded the court 
should receive all evidence relating to his health and determine at 
this stage that if persuaded that such is the case the prosecution 
should not go forward against him 
but labella surprised the defense and us district judge john f 
keenan by reversing his previous stand and requesting that mr 
marcos be arraigned as promptly as possible in hawaii 
labella said marcos recent hospitalization would keep him from 
traveling for four to six weeks and further delay is now 
prejudicing the governments case 
labella said other defendants might seek to go to trial sooner 
than marcos is able prompting the government to conduct more than 
one trial 
but hibey argued that marcos most recent hospitalization 
doesnt begin to tell the story of marcos multisystem 
illnesses 
its a question your honor of an ability to survive hibey 
said 
keenan decided that a hearing thursday in manhattan would 
consider both aspects marcos ability to travel for arraignment and 
his physical ability to stand trial at any time

infection chronic pain incontinence and the need for corrective 
surgery in many patients the board charged 
burt sent a letter to the board last month denying the charges 
and requesting a hearing the board tentatively set a jan 30 
hearing date 
but moore said tuesday his client offered to surrender the 
license and dispense with the hearing whether they do that or not 
i dont know otherwise well go ahead with the hearing 
he said burt has in effect retired anyway hes not 
practicing any medicine at all moore said 
state medical board spokeswoman lauren lubow did not immediately 
return telephone calls for comment today calls to burts office 
went unanswered today 
ms lubow has said the severest penalty the state board could 
impose would be permanent revocation of burts license the board 
limited the doctor to nonsurgical medical practice in november 
at least three of burts former patients have each filed 3 
million medical malpractice suits against the gynecologist 
burt has denied performing the surgery without his patients 
permission

investigators believe the luggage 
container in which the bomb that destroyed pan am flight 103 was 
hidden was put on the jumbo jet in frankfurt west germany a 
newspaper reported today 
police said tuesday they had identified the luggage container 
but would not comment on whether it was placed on the flight in 
frankfurt or london 
we have now identified the baggage container within the 
aircraft in which the explosive device was placed and substantial 
forensic and reconstructive work is being undertaken in this 
regard said detective chief superintendent john orr the scottish 
police officer heading the investigation 
no details of the container what else it held where it was 
discovered or where it originated were given officially but police 
and accident investigators are now convinced that it was in luggage 
first loaded at frankfurt the times of london said today 
jochen schroers a spokesman for the frankfurt prosecutors 
office said the report was purely speculative and premature and 
that there was no evidence to support it 
police and department of transport spokesmen refused today to 
elaborate on orrs remarks or comment on the times report 
the new yorkbound flight originated in frankfurt with a boeing 
727 and changed to a boeing 747 at londons heathrow airport 
transferring passengres and baggage all 259 people on board and 11 
on the ground in the scottish town of lockerbie were killed after 
the jet exploded at 31000 feet on dec 21 
the times said police think the bomb consisted of only a few 
pounds of czechoslovakmade semtex plastic explosives 
the paper said investigators think that once a hole was blown in 
the side of the jet and the electronics bay its nerve center 
destroyed the air pressure at the high altitude literally ripped 
the jet apart 
investigators say the blast occurred in the cargo area just in 
front of the left wing of the plane 
orr told a news conference that about 10000 items of baggage and 
other items from the plane have been recovered in searches 
stretching across scotland he said scottish police were working 
with their counterparts in the united states and west germany and 
that more than 3000 witness statements had been collated he said 
some investigations have been conducted in scandinavia but refused 
to elaborate 
orr also refused to say which group if any police suspect of 
carrying out the bombing there has been a lot of comment some 
illinformed and i do not think it would be helpful to identify any 
group he said 
several terrorist groups are thought to have supplies of semtex 
a powerful and hardtodetect plastic explosive british authorities 
have said the bomb that destroyed flight 103 was probably semtex

a new sentencing system that took effect in 
november 1987 for people convicted of federal crimes is 
constitutional the supreme court ruled today in a decision that 
will affect thousands 
by an 81 vote the justices upheld the us sentencing 
commissions rules the decision also upheld the validity of the 
commission itself 
scores of federal trial judges have refused to use the new 
sentencing rules calling them and the commission unconstitutional 
now defendants sentenced by those judges must be resentenced 
the decision carries no impact however for any defendant 
sentenced in a state court 
about 10000 federal court defendants have been subjected to the 
new sentencing system 
the commission was created by congress in the sentencing reform 
act of 1984 legislation aimed at eliminating what some called 
unjustified disparities in sentences 
the law empowers the commission with seven members appointed to 
sixyear terms by the president to tell federal judges what 
sentences should be imposed for various crimes three of the 
commissions members must be federal judges 
the guidelines generally stiffened the prison time federal 
convicts are required to serve the commission eliminated parole and 
curtailed credit for good behavior 
judges who had struck down the new sentencing system had ruled 
that congress unlawfully avoided political accountability by 
unconstitutionally delegating its legislative power to the 
commission 
that the commission because it includes members of the 
judiciary and holds legislative power violates the constitutions 
separation of powers principle 
that the new rules violate defendants dueprocess rights by 
curbing too severely judges sentencing discretion 
writing for the court today justice harry a blackmun said those 
judges were wrong 
congess neither delegated excessive legislative power nor upset 
the constitutionally mandated balance of powers among the coordinate 
branches blackmun said 
the constitutions structural protections do not prohibit 
congress from delegating to an expert body located within the 
judicial branch the intricate task of formulating sentencing 
guidelines consistent with such significant statutory direction as 
is present here he said 
in justifying judges membership on the commission blackmun said 
congress is free to call on the judicial branchs help in a matter 
uniquely within the ken of judges 
only justice antonin scalia dissented on grounds that the 
commission was given power not authorized by the constitution 
sentencing commission chairman william w wilkins jr a judge on 
the 4th us circuit court of appeals in richmond va called 
todays ruling one of the most important decisions handed down by 
the court this decade

the supreme court ruled today that labor unions 
may not fire elected local union officials who disagree with 
policies of the parent union 
the 80 decision permits a union business representative in the 
los angeles area to sue the sheet metal workers international 
association for his allegedly illegal firing 
justice thurgood marshall writing for the court said firing an 
elected official as opposed to an appointed one violates a 1959 
federal law the labormanagement reporting and disclosure act 
the law is designed to ensure that unions are democratically 
governed and responsive to the will of the union membership as 
expressed in open periodic elections marshall said 
permitting an official to be fired for expressing dissenting 
opinions would lead union members to conlude that one challenged 
the union hierarchy if at all at ones peril he said that is 
precisely what congress sought to prevent when it passed the 1959 
law 
the ruling permits edward lynn elected business representative 
in 1981 of local 75 of the sheet metal workers union to sue the 
governing union international 
lynn and other members of the local became increasingly critical 
of spending by the parent union and organized a dissident group that 
successfully defeated proposals to raise the locals dues 
the international union placed local 75 in trusteeship in 1982 
under the leadership of a regional official richard hawkins 
hawkins proposed a new dues increase that again was defeated 
with lynn leading the fight against the hike 
hawkins then filed charges against lynn and the union 
international removed lynn from office and fined him 2500 
lynn filed a federal lawsuit in 1983 accusing union leaders of 
firing him illegally and violating his freespeech rights 
a federal judge threw out the suit but the 9th us circuit 
court of appeals reinstated it in 1987 the appeals court ruling was 
upheld today by the supreme court 
marshall said today that lynns situation is different from a 
case that resulted in a 1982 high court ruling in that case the 
court upheld the firing of a unions appointed business agents by a 
new union president who defeated the previous president in a union 
election 
the case acted on today is sheet metal workers vs lynn 861940

here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout 
the nation 
jan 12 
the evening journal martinsburg wva on the federal budget 
federal budgetmaking is the complex and often painful process of 
sorting out national priorities 
this year to compound the difficulties inherent in this task 
these choices are now being made by two groups president reagans 
departing band of officeholders and presidentelect bushs incoming 
group of government managers like all new presidents bush must 
live for a while with the budget he inherits from the departing 
incumbent 
although the bush transition team is working closely with the 
reagan administration on the fiscal 1990 budget undoubtedly the new 
president will want to establish his own priorities as soon as 
possible there well may be two budgets this year 
of course what congress finally comes up with in the way of 
government spending generally bears little relationship to the 
fiscal proposals coming from the white house and all the budgets 
could wind up being exercises in futility

scottsdale ariz progress on the supreme court and abortion 
the forces against abortion are elated they smell victory in the 
fight to overturn the 1973 decision which legalized abortion 
nationwide roe vs wade 
the cause of this elation is the supreme courts decision to 
review missouris law regulating public financing of and 
participation in abortions 
the missouri law prohibits abortions being performed in public 
hospitals requires viability tests for fetuses beyond the 19th week 
and defines life as beginning at conception 
the 8th us circuit court of appeals struck down all of these 
provisions 
abortion opponents hope the supreme court will uphold at least 
one of these points and be unable to reconcile it to roe vs wade 
 
no supreme court action though is going to stop abortion it 
will only move it back to the horrors of those back alleys

starkville miss daily news on the death of emperor hirihito 
many americans old enough to remember the events of world war ii 
have mixed feelings about japanese emperor hirohito 
during the war hirohito images were everywhere in the united 
states as symbols of japanese aggression and cruelty 
but historians have now told us that the emperor who had no 
constitutional powers fought privately to keep the country out of 
war with america he lost out to the warloards who ran the military 
 
japan has become one of our strongest allies and its partly 
because this country even while conquering the japanese recognized 
how important the emperor was to them

the miami herald on william bennett as drug czar 
what did congress intend when it created the cabinetlevel 
position of director of the office of national drug control policy 
many members and nonpolitical drug experts had hoped for an 
experienced team builder who could bring law enforcement and the 
military together with business leaders educators rehabilitation 
experts and public health authorities to forge a coherent attack on 
both the supply and the demand side of the drug problem 
instead of such a leader however presidentelect bush has 
designated the fiery former education secretary william j bennett 
 
bennett made his reputation as a rhetorical flamethrower 
to win senate approval and to succeed as the nations first drug

ted bundys death warrant for murdering 
a girl was signed minutes after the us supreme court rejected his 
appeal and the mayor of the slain childs town said the execution 
would prompt celebrations 
in signing the warrant gov bob martinez set the execution for 
jan 24 for the 1978 rape and murder of 12yearold kimberly diane 
leach who was abducted in lake city and was found dead in a pig sty 
it was the fourth time the 42yearold former law student has 
been scheduled to die in floridas electric chair bundy whose case 
was depicted in the television miniseries the deliberate 
stranger has come within hours of being executed only to win 
postponement 
his attorneys said after tuesdays 72 high court decision they 
would pursue further appeals there also were reports today that 
bundy might offer information about other killings in an attempt to 
delay his execution 
bundy also has also been sentenced to death for killing two women 
in a florida state university sorority house in tallahassee three 
weeks before kimberlys murder he has been linked to up to 36 sex 
murders or disappearances of young women most in utah colorado and 
washington state 
justice has been on hold for a decade and its about time ted 
bundy paid for his crimes martinez said i have a strong 
feeling on tuesday of next week the state will be able to carry out 
its duty 
therell be a celebration when he dies said gerald witt 
mayor of lake city a rural town of 11000 people near the georgia 
border he has such a terrible criminal record its just 
impossible to have any sympathy for him 
in utah salt lake county authorities believe bundy was 
responsible for the disappearances of five teenage girls and think 
he may have been involved in that of a young woman sheriff pete 
hayward said tuesday that investigators would travel to florida this 
weekend to question bundy perhaps for one last time 
in western washington state bundy is the prime suspect in the 
1974 slayings of eight young women whose murders remain unsolved 
i cant believe its finally going to come to an end said 
eleanore rose whose daughter denise naslund was one of the eight 
they keep giving him appeal after appeal after appeal now that it 
the execution may happen im in a kind of shock 
its not going to bring denise back all of us who lost 
daughters were still going to have all those unanswered 
questions ms rose said she said she had hoped bundy would 
confess to the slayings to put our minds at ease 
state attorney jerry blair who prosecuted bundy in the leach 
case said theres a move underfoot to delay his execution on 
grounds that hes ready to come clean and tell everything he knows 
as far as im concerned hed have to talk between now and 
tuesday blair added bundy has been on death row for over 10 
years and i would have to view any offer to talk now as a 
continuing effort to buy time 
in addition a prison spokesman said today that bundy had changed 
his mind about talking to journalists 
bob macmaster a spokesman for the state department of 
corrections said bundy agreed to hold an hourlong group interview 
monday afternoon followed by a onehour interview with a single 
newspaper or broadcast station that bundy will pick 
in the appeal rejected tuesday bundys attorneys argued that 
lower courts wrongly determined in retrospect that bundy had been 
competent to stand trial in 1980 for kimberlys slaying 
a federal judge in 1986 ruled that bundy had been competent in 
1980 calling him the most competent serial killer in the country 
at this time a diabolical genius the 11th us circuit court 
of appeals in atlanta upheld the judges ruling 
the appeal said the supreme court has never addressed the issue 
of when if ever a posttrial hearing would be adequate to remedy 
a violation of a defendants right to a contemporary 
determination of his competency when sufficient indications arise 
at trial 
the high court in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a 
contemporary competency hearing 
bundys attorney james coleman jr said he planned to file a new 
emergency appeal in a florida state court but refused to disclose 
what legal arguments would be used

los angeles times on william bennett as drug czar 
presidentelect george bush made a poor choice in naming william 
j bennett the abrasive former secretary of education to head the 
new office of national drug control policy 
the head of any antidrug campaign must be prepared to handle 
oftensensitive negotiations with countries that produce or ship 
illegal drugs and the drug czar must also help soothe internal 
rivalries between such independent government agencies as the fbi 
and the coast guard 
that is reason enough it seems to have avoided 
shootfromthelip candidates like bennett or us customs 
commissioner william von raab whose outbursts against mexico have 
angered officials in that country 
now that the choice is made bennett should pay heed to the 
requirements of the legislation that created his new job 
we are convinced that a calm and honest assessment of the 
nations war on drugs will find that attempts to halt drug 
trafficking in source countries and at our borders do not work 
as well as education and treatment programs that eliminate the 
demand for illegal drugs in this country

unless george bush can find a more effective way to spend the 
nations money in fiscal 1990 than president reagan would the 
presidentelects promise of a kinder gentler america could 
turn out to be nothing more than an empty campaign slogan 
reagans 115 trillion spending plan for next year would be 
anything but kind and gentle to many americans to the contrary 
it would hit them extremely hard 
doctors veterans boat owners air travelers federal retirees 
children who eat subsidized lunches at school as well as people in 
scores of other categories nationwide would feel the crunch 
one of governments primary responsibilities is providing for a 
strong national defense being stuck in a militarily vulnerable 
position could spell our doom faster than anything else 
at the same time though government also has a duty to care for 
its people who after all are the government 
after taking office bush obviously will need to wrestle with 
that dilemma which seems to boil down to deciding which is more 
important more guns and less butter or viceversa

the evening sun baltimore on the palestinian uprising 
since the beginning of the palestinian uprising called the 
intifadah 13 months ago leaders of the israeli defense forces have 
been troubled with the role the political leaders have thrust upon 
them 
the politicians talk tough but it is young soldiers who fire the 
bullets which have killed 359 people 
riot control is not a normal military function and this 
undoubtedly accounts for the high death rate in israel while 
comparable uprisings in korea and the philippines resulted in few 
deaths 
this week israeli troops took the unprecedented step of ordering 
small midnight burials for intifadah victims since their funerals 
have often produced more confrontation and death such steps cast 
the idf in an opprobrious role

rights after nazi germany wants to hold a conference on human 
rights in moscow in 1991 
to mikhail gorbachev it is a crucial step in his campaign to 
halt abuses of the past 
gorbachev is pushing the conference for two apparent reasons he 
wants to remove the stigma of the stalinist terror from the soviet 
unions image he appears to want to grant some but not all human 
rights to his country 
gorbachev has made significant human rights progress in a short 
time in the past year many soviet prisoners of dissent have been 
released the doors of emigration have opened for 100 jewish 
refuseniks long denied visas some 60000 soviet jews and armenians 
may be permittedto emigrate this year 
it may take decades or centuries to transform soviet society into 
a land of freedom but the crucial process has been started

what does this tell us 
first that the vast efforts to educate the us public about the 
dangers of smoking has helped in particular surgeon general c 
everett koop has waged a battle against smoking 
but the second development one that koop also supports is that 
smoking simply isnt in anymore it is social pressure that has 
stopped some people smoking and has kept some from starting 
as koop said to the associated press this is not a prohibitive 
society were not going to tell people they cant smoke we learned 
that we cant tell people they cant drink

the albuquerque nm tribune on insurance for bank and thrift 
deposits 
in its final report president reagans council of economic 
advisers made an interesting recommendation lower the ceiling on 
federally insured deposits in banks and thrift institutions 
deposit insurance is a depressionera idea that once made sense 
it discouraged runs on banks and gave small savers a safe place for 
their money recently however it contributed to a national crap 
shoot that may cost the public 100 billion 
in 1980 congress unwisely raised the insurance limit to 100000 
from 40000 thus a device designed to protect mom and pop 
depositors became a nolose game for the wealthy who could put a 
norisk 100000 in one bank or 1 million in 10 banks 
because of gogo banking money brokers lax regulation and 
deposit insurance the taxpayers are about to take a huge hit to 
rescue the thrift industry the way to protect themselves from a 
future hit is to stop guaranteeing other peoples unwise investments

the news tribune woodbridge nj on federal pollution controls 
because all four airquality regions of the state have 
unacceptable levels of ozone the federal government forced the 
state to require major gas stations to install pump nozzles designed 
to retrieve gasoline vapors 
there is a better way if congress acknowledged that controlling 
air pollution is indeed a national task it would require automobile 
manufacturers to equip new cars with special canisters that would 
provide the same result vapors would be directed toward the 
gasoline tank through a system that would cost an estimated 15 to 
35 per car 
under the present rules only areas that fail ozone tests such 
as los angeles washington dc long island and new jersey are 
forced to act but hydrocarbons let loose in wideopen wyoming and 
rural pennsylvania are just as unhealthy and all contribute to 
the socalled greenhouse effect 
by not acting on a national level congress is bowing to its 
friends in the automobile business while giving a 
lessthansufficient response to ozone pollution

hud secretarydesignate jack kemp told bigcity 
mayors today he would be an activist and advocate for solving 
housing and other urban problems calling himself a bigl 
liberal on urban issues 
kemp addressing the us conference of mayors cited the 
problems posed by federal budget constraints but spoke 
enthusiastically about working with mayors whose complaints about 
cuts in federal aid to cities have been a constant refrain 
im going to throw the labels out were going to throw out 
ideology said the former new york republican congressman chosen 
by presidentelect bush to head the department of housing and urban 
development 
i am going to be an activist im going to be an advocate the 
door is open my mind is open 
kemp a conservative who unsuccessfully sought the republican 
presidential nomination drew applause from the mayors when he 
described himself as a bleeding heart conservative and a 
progressive conservative 
he added i want to be considered a bigl liberal on race 
poverty and relations between mayors and hud 
kemp listened as mayors described problems in their cities caused 
by a shortage of affordable housing and cuts in federal housing aid 
and other programs 
he noted that he has been associated with tax reform but said 
it went too far when it comes to affordable low and moderate 
income housing 
he added im speaking for kemp now im not speaking for the 
administration 
the conference on tuesday released a survey showing increased 
hunger and homelessness in mayor us cities particularly among 
families and children 
sen james sasser dtenn the new chairman of the senate budget 
committee called the findings a devastating indictment of the 
neglect of the needs of our major urban centers 
he said the mayors make a compelling case for more federal 
assistance to help the homeless problem devastating indictment 
of the neglect of urban america 
sasser said president reagans budget proposal for fiscal 1990 
virtually ignores the problem of urban homelessness and that 
congress will expect a revised proposal from the new administration 
families women and children they make up the most 
significant increase we have experienced in homelessness boston 
mayor raymond flynn said in releasing the findings 
flynn said the rate of increase in hunger and homelessness seemed 
to slow from the previous year he attributed that in part to 
increased emergency services provided by state and local governments 
officials in every city surveyed cited the lack of affordable 
housing as the main cause of homelessness flynn cited the decline 
in federal spending on lowincome housing during the reagan 
administration 
shelters are not the answer flynn said permanent 
affordable housing that is the answer 
among the surveys findings were that in the last year in the 27 
surveyed cities 
requests for emergency shelter increased an average 13 percent 
all but two of the cities reported an increase the rate of increase 
had been 18 percent in a similar survey a year ago 
requests for emergency food were up in nine of 10 cities by an 
average 19 percent threefifths of those asking for emergency food 
were members of families 
an average 19 percent of the requests for emergency shelter went 
unmet among homeless families 23 percent of requests were unmet 
shelters in two out of three cities reported they turn away homeless 
families because of a lack of resources 
in 62 percent of the cities emergency food assistance 
facilities had to turn away people because of lack of resources 
on average the composition of the homeless population was 49 
percent single men 34 percent members of families 13 percent 
single women and 5 percent unaccompanied youth one in four was a 
child an average 34 percent of homeless were substance abusers and 
onefourth were severely mentally ill 23 percent had fulltime or 
parttime jobs 26 percent were veterans 
the survey was conducted in 27 cities whose mayors sit on the 
conferences task force on hunger and homelessness they were

condition at no 2 military hospital in the cape town suburb of 
wynberg his office said no further medical statements would be 
issued for the time being unless the presidents condition worsened

took charge of south africas whitecontrolled government as prime 
minister in 1978 under a new constitution he became president in 
1984 
the modern fivestory hospital in wynberg part of a military 
base is considered one of the best in southern africa botha laid 
the cornerstone for the main building in 1976 when he was defense 
minister 
the presidents wife for 46 years elize and some of their five 
children came to the hospital to be with her husband the state 
radio said 
the staterun south african broadcasting corp said botha 
suffered the stroke early in the morning while at his home 
bothas office said the president remained in charge of the 
country along with the rest of the cabinet bothas staff 
initially said the cabinet would meet to consider naming an acting 
president but later his office said botha was quite 
clearminded and was likely to make the appointment himself on 
thursday 
according to south africas constitution the president can 
appoint a cabinet minister to fill in for him temporarily if the 
president is incapacitated the cabinet can elect one of its members 
as acting president 
caspar venter a bureau for information official said any of 
several senior cabinet ministers could be designated to fill in for 
the president in the event of his absence from the country or his 
incapacitation 
botha has refused to comment about when he might step down from 
the presidency there has been intense speculation but no 
consensus about which cabinet member might be selected by the 
national party as bothas successor 
among those mentioned as possible successors are foreign affairs 
minister pik botha who is not related to the president national 
education minister fw de klerk constitutional development 
minister chris heunis and defense minister magnus malan 
during his years in power botha has maintained the national 
partys political dominance despite harsh criticism both from the 
antiapartheid movement and from extremeright whites 
he has presided over the first significant racial reforms 
undertaken during the national partys 40year rule such as 
legalization of interracial marriages and abolition of pass laws 
which restricted blacks movements 
but he has refused to negotiate with the african national 
congress the main guerrilla movement fighting the government or to 
release the ancs jailed leader nelson mandela 
botha has refused to discuss the possibility of a oneperson 
onevote system in south africa where the 5 million whites control 
the government and economy while the 26 million blacks have no vote 
in national affairs 
the wynberg hospital is about a mile from the constantiaberg 
clinic where mandela spent several weeks recuperating from 
tuberculosis last year before being transferred to a staff home at a 
prison farm in the town of paarl

prosecutors said today they have 
opened a criminal investigation into ibi engineering a company 
us officials accused of helping build a suspected libyan chemical 
weapons plant 
in bonn opposition lawmakers shouted and hooted during a 
parliamentary session in which the government again altered its 
official position on when it knew about the suspect plant which 
libya claims will produce pharmaceuticals 
besides the ibi engineering probe federal officials are 
investigating overall west german involvement and a local 
prosecutor in the southern city of offenburg is investigating the 
imhausenchemie company us officials allege imhausen also was a 
major participant in the libyan project 
west germanys ard television estimated that 50 companies in the 
frankfurt area alone had a role in building the libyan plant 
our authorities opened the probe against ibi on friday 
because of suspicion of reported violations of export laws 
frankfurt prosecutor jochen schroers told the associated press in a 
telephone interview today he did not say why the investigation was 
not announced earlier 
schroers refused to provide further information about the 
investigation of the nowdefunct company owned by iraqi businessman 
ihsan barbouti who reportedly coordinated the libyan plant 
construction 
ibi allegedly provided the contracts to the west german 
companies 
earlier today in munich prosecutors said they have begun a 
criminal investigation of a bavarian firm that a news magazine says 
helped libya develop the ability for inflight refueling of 
warplanes 
munich prosecutor heinz stocker said the intec technical trade 
and logistic company was suspected of violating west germanys 
export laws 
he said the probe was focusing on whether fuel tank equipment 
sent to libya required an export permit 
government officials have said some west german companies with 
connections to the libyan plant may have been unwitting 
participants three more companies were added to the growing list 
tuesday 
in parliament wolfgang schaeuble chancellor helmut kohls chief 
of staff said today that on the basis of intelligence reports we 
must assume that this plant in rabta is intended to produce chemical 
weapons 
on tuesday chief government spokesman friedhelm ost refused to 
say whether bonn had evidence backing charges the plant was built to 
produce such weapons 
schaeuble said the american embassy in bonn informed west german 
officials may 18 about possible german involvement in the plant 
thats five months earlier than what the government acknowledged 
monday and six months earlier than the nov 15 date west german 
leaders mentioned three weeks ago 
israeli leaders criticized german involvement in the libyan 
complex pointing out that libya is one of israels most dangerous 
enemies 
israeli finance minister shimon peres was expected to take up the 
matter with chancellor helmut kohl when he begins a fourday visit 
to bonn today 
the merck chemical company on tuesday notified government 
officials it had shipped 19 tons of a chemical solvent to libya last 
year adding that the destination may have been the suspected poison 
gas plant in rabta 
merck has regular business dealings with libya most involving 
small deliveries of chemicals and medicines to hospitals and 
universities said company spokesman hansjoachim schmitt 
on the same day helmut barmann head of the local branch of the 
rhenus transportation company in cologne said his firm had entered 
into contracts with ibi in 1986 1987 and 1988 to deliver 
materials to libya 
construction materials and in one case chemicals were 
involved barmann told the ap in a telephone interview 
barmann declined to provide further details adding that federal 
customs officials had seized the companys records as part of the 
libyan probe 
other west german companies reportedly involved include the 
salzgitter industriebau company which according to stern magazine 
made the plans for the facility 60 miles south of tripoli 
salzgitter industriebau which is fullyowned by the west german 
government has denied participation 
also tuesday the alfred teves company of frankfurt told the ap 
that it had supplied 28 million worth of ventilation equipment to 
ibi in 1986 
spokesman gerd sinreich said the company believed the material 
was to be used for a pharmaceutical plant in hong kong stern 
magazine says the hong kong plant was built to disguise west german 
involvement in the libyan facility

the government under israeli attack over a foreign 
office ministers meeting with yasser arafat is trying to convey 
the message that it is not tilting away from israel to the palestine 
liberation organization 
the british government is stressing that it does not recognize 
the plo as the palestinians sole representative does not support 
the creation of an independent palestinian state and has no plans 
for arafat to meet prime minister margaret thatcher 
newspaper accounts as well as a government source drew a 
picture of a prime minister who wants to leave middle east 
peacemaking to the americans and appear neutral without seeming to 
go up against a minister in her own government 
britain was criticized sharply by israel this week over a meeting 
in tunis between arafat and william waldegrave a junior foreign 
office minister and the remarks waldegrave made during and after 
the meeting 
the israelis were particularly incensed to hear waldegrave 
suggesting that arafat and prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel 
both were exterrorists 
waldegrave warned israel against cleversilly responses to 
arafats new peacemaking posture and said that if israel failed to 
grasp the initiative it would be left behind 
the tabloid sun denounced waldegraves insulting attitude 
toward israel and the evening standard ran a cartoon showing 
british dignitaries from the archbishop of canterbury downward 
lining up to embrace arafat 
greville janner a veteran proisrael lawmaker accused 
waldegrave of publicly lecturing and tactlessly attacking israels 
democratically elected leaders while sitting beside a man who until 
recently was responsible for a series of savage terrorist attacks on 
israels people 
but other papers generally backed waldegrave and janner 
speaking in a parliamentary debate on the middle east on tuesday 
night was a lone voice members of the governing conservative party 
as well as opposition laborites rallied around waldegrave and mrs 
thatcher pointedly sat beside him through the debate 
as a member of parliament mrs thatcher represents finchley a 
london constituency with a large jewish population and is known to 
harbor strong personal affection for israel 
but she already has disagreed with israel on the plos recent 
decision to recognize israel and disavow terrorism believing it is 
an opportunity jerusalem should seize 
during the parliamentary debate her contributions were guarded 
she said she wanted both sides to sit down to peaceful negotiations 
but cautioned that it would take a long time and that nothing 
could be started before the new administration in the united states 
is well in position and has decided precisely what is its policy 
the times of london said tuesday that mrs thatcher was trying to 
avert a clash with shamir and prevent the tunis meeting the 
highestlevel britishplo encounter so far from raising further 
diplomatic heat 
on wednesday a government source speaking on condition of 
anonymity indicated that the government did not want to carry 
waldegraves remarks further and that the aim was now to pour oil 
on these troubled waters 
the source insisted there was no change in britains policy of 
not recognizing the plo as the palestinians sole representative 
and its wish for palestinian national aspirations to be met in a 
confederation with jordan rather than through an independent state 
the source also said mrs thatcher who has invited shamir to 
london had no plans to meet with arafat 
the british are keen to knock down any notion that they are 
trying to play broker 
they believe mrs thatcher enjoys the respect of all the parties 
involved and that britain still derives influence in the middle 
east from its empire days 
but as the source put it wednesday london recognizes that the 
people with the real clout are the americans

a chicago company has agreed not to contend in 
ads that its water treatment system removes certain chemicals unless 
it can back up what it says the federal trade commission said 
wednesday 
the company associated mills inc signed a proposed consent 
decree that also requires it not to claim without substantiation 
that the membrane cartridge of its pollenex bottled water maker 
reverse osmosis system can last a year without replacement

advertising that its system removed up to 99 percent of organic 
chemicals and other contaminants from tap water and nearly all or 
most of the family of chemicals called trihalomethanes which can be 
produced by chlorination 
however the company had no basis for that claim the ftc said 
under the decree associated must have a reasonable basis for 
any claims of performance or longevity of its water treatment 
products 
by signing the decree associated neither admitted nor denied 
guilt however it will make itself liable for a fine of 10000 if 
it should be found to have violated any terms in the future if the 
decree is adopted 
the commission will receive public comment on the decree until

the greek orthodox patriarch 
of jerusalem hurled a golden cross into the muddy jordan river on 
wednesday and released two white doves to bless the site where 
tradition says jesus was baptized 
during an annual ceremony at the steep river bank patriarch 
diodoros i was surrounded by about 300 pilgrims most of them 
palestinian and greek women many held plastic and glass bottles to 
be filled with blessed river water 
about a dozen israeli soldiers armed with submachine guns guarded 
the pilgrims as they made their way along barbed wire fences and 
mine fields to the river bank 
attendance has dropped by about 80 percent since the beginning of 
the palestinian uprising in december 1987 said father innocent a 
greek orthodox priest people are simply scared he said 
the jordan river has served as a ceasefire line since the 1967 
middle east war when israel captured the west bank from jordan 
shortly after the war israel closed the river bank to visitors 
because of shelling by palestinian guerrillas 
israel first allowed eastern orthodox denominations to return for 
their annual baptism ceremony in 1981 roman catholics who hold a 
ceremony nearby in october followed in 1985 
the border makes me feel worried said chris kalivas a truck 
driver from athens this is not what i had imagined he added 
pointing at the barren desert lining the 60footwide river 
everything looks so desolate added stefan durst a lutheran 
pastor from hamburg west germany durst said he came out of 
professional curiosity 
other pilgrims were more cheerful 
im not scared weve come here to pray to jesus said 
shahira mahle 18 who came with a group of 50 israeli arab pilgrims 
from the northern israeli town of nazareth 
also among the pilgrims were russian and romanian nuns in black 
habits and black coneshaped velvet caps 
the threehour ceremony began with the reading of psalms and 
scriptures in greek and arabic at st johns monastery 
the site along with other monasteries near the river was 
abandoned in 1970 after a romanian monk was killed by palestinian 
guerrillas said shmuel hamburger of the west banks military 
government 
after the prayers the patriarch led a procession of 40 chanting 
priests in black and gold robes to the river bank 
diodoros then hurled the cross tied to a rope and wrapped in a 
bunch of basil into the murky river the two white doves released 
by the patriarch fluttered over the river before settling among the 
reeds at the waters edge

us industry operated at its highest rate in 
nine years last month the government reported wednesday but 
analysts said the modest pace of growth should allay fears of 
increasing inflation 
use of industrial capacity at factories mines and utilities rose 
01 percentage point to 842 percent last month the highest rate 
since it hit 843 percent in november 1979 the federal reserve 
said the operating rate for november 1988 was a revised 841 
percent and octobers figure was 840 percent 
in an accompanying report the agency said industrial production 
climbed a moderate 03 percent in december following a revised 
increase of 04 percent in november 
while high operating rates can cause concern that factories will 
have trouble meeting demand resulting in shortages and higher 
prices economists said decembers increases were small enough that 
they didnt point to higher inflation 
lawrence chimerine of the wefa group consultants in bala cynwyd 
pa said the reports were consistent with continued recovery in 
the industrial sector and moderate growth in the economy as a 
whole 
its probably the best of both worlds he said it showed 
continued expansion but at a moderate pace 
robert brusca of nikko securities co international inc in new 
york said that while operating rates were high the specter of 
inflation doesnt seem to be as much on our doorstep as some 
people have pretended 
on the other hand brusca expressed concern that production is 
not increasing fast enough to satisfy domestic demand and to make 
progress on the us trade deficit which widened to 125 billion

a former navy technician pleaded innocent 
wednesday to charges he tried to sell antisubmarine warfare secrets 
to the soviets 
us district judge robert g doumar set an april 3 trial for 
craig d kunkle 39 of virginia beach who was arrested and charged 
with espionage jan 10 in an fbi sting 
kunkle said he wanted to become a soviet spy for the money and to 
get back at the navy which discharged him for indecent exposure in 
1985 the fbi said 
the former chief petty officer is confident he will be 
exonerated and his spirits are good defense attorney james c 
lewis said after the arraignment 
there are two sides to every story all youve heard so far is 
what the government claims occurred in this case he said 
kunkle a hospital security guard was arrested in williamsburg 
by two fbi agents posing as soviet officials 
as a hidden camera recorded the meeting kunkle revealed secret 
information that he recalled from his job as an antisubmarine 
warfare instructor four years ago the fbi said kunkle was paid 
5000 for the information the fbi said 
lewis said no classified information reached the soviet union 
kunkle remained jailed without bail an fbi agent last week 
testified that kunkle called himself smarter and more professional 
than former navy man john a walker jr who was sentenced to life 
in prison in 1986 for running a soviet spy ring for 17 years 
trial preparations are expected to be complicated because 
classified information is involved and court personnel must receive 
security clearances 
lewis said the defense could be helped by the governments 
reluctance to reveal classified materials in court 
there is a disincentive for the government to reveal 
information and it can work to your advantage he said whether 
it will in this case remains to be seen

when president reagan donned white tie and 
tails last week to attend a fancy dinner in new york city he 
confided to aides hed had the elegantly styled suit made 40 years 
ago for the 1948 academy awards 
its hard to believe but its true said presidential 
spokesman marlin fitzwater a man who is wellacquainted with the 
battle of the bulge i dont think hes even had it altered 
ronald reagan who leaves office friday bore the burdens of the 
presidency for two terms and even weathered a harrowing 
assassination attempt in 1981 not to mention a 1985 bout with colon 
cancer and a few other surgeries 
yet except for a few more wrinkles and some gray hair hes 
retained a physique that defies the image of a 77yearold 
grandfather 
those close to him including first lady nancy reagan say its 
all due to a remarkable discipline begun as a teenage lifeguard 
and honed as an actor attentive to diet and physical fitness 
hes in amazing health said dr larry mohr one of the 
presidents white house physicians it has to do with genes but 
also with his attitude hes just always on an even keel 
reagan has never been shy about the fact that hes religiously 
followed a 9to5 office schedule allowing plenty of time for rest 
and relaxation over his eightyear presidency reagan has spent 
some 457 days in california mostly on vacation at his ranch near 
santa barbara or in his old home town of los angeles 
aides point out that reagans sense of humor and an ability to 
avoid taking himself too seriously may have helped keep him in 
shape 
pictures of reagan dubbed rawhide by the secret service 
adorn many white house walls one favorite shows the president in 
jeans workshirt and protective goggles with chainsaw in hand and 
biceps bulging as he mows down wizened scrub oak trees on his 
california ranch 
the president chats often with his aides about his diet and how 
he keeps healthy fitzwater said 
he is so conscientious about using his bodybuilding equipment on 
a daily basis that he had it hauled to moscow last year for the 
threeday summit with soviet leader mikhail s gorbachev he 
worked out every night after the meetings and before dinner 
fitzwater said 
i peel down and go into the gym reagan said in a recent 
interview with cbs 60 minutes adding that he uses a 
treadmill and various nautilus weight equipment 
mrs reagan in the same interview said shes had to temper 
reagans enthusiasm for the exercises suggested by his physicians 
as a way to get back in shape after the 1981 shooting and chest 
surgery because the president was adding so much muscle he was 
threatening to outgrow his suits 
i kept saying stop dont increase any more this is getting 
too expensive mrs reagan said with a laugh 
reagan keeps a constant watch on his weight hovering at 189 to 
190 pounds with a 34inch waistline by comparing himself weekly 
with his personal physician dr john hutton who also tries to hold 
to the weight level 
every tuesday we have a weighoff said hutton recently if 
were a pound or two over we see who can get it off first 
mrs reagan who says she also tries to follow a daily exercise 
routine recalls that at one time in college she weighed 145 pounds 
but now weighs only 105 or 106 pounds 
at a recent luncheon the first lady poohpoohed reports that she 
was anorexic contending that the worries over her husbands 
shooting as well as her parents deaths had caused her to drop 
some pounds while in the white house with a big smile mrs reagan 
eagerly scooped up a dessert of bread pudding 
but the first lady made clear that the presidents eating and 
exercise habits are his alone its his own thing mrs reagan 
said in the interview i just think you have to have a 
wellbalanced sensible diet im not one for extremes 
fitzwater who has struggled with diets and poked fun at his own 
stocky frame shakes his head in wonderment at the presidents 
ability to be a very disciplined eater 
his whole life is very disciplined he just doesnt let 
himself go he drinks a glass of wine at lunch for a state official 
or a visiting dignitary i dont think ive ever seen him take a 
hard drink fitzwater said 
the spokesman added that hes watched in wonder as reagan will 
consume a green salad or jello even if others at the same table 
are chowing down on a beef wellington which happens to be his 
favorite

president reagan said wednesday that patricia 
hearst shaws pardon request hasnt come to my desk for attention 
yet as a senior official said he did not expect reagan to grant 
too extraordinary pardons before he leaves office friday 
the president during a picturetaking session with members of 
congress who were given presidential citizens medals was asked 
whether he was going to grant mrs shaws plea 
there are always pardons coming across my desk from the justice 
department he said asked specifically about mrs shaw convicted 
for her role in a san francisco bank robbery 14 years ago reagan 
replied no that hasnt come to my desk for attention yet 
the president on sunday however told reporters he had asked 
aides to look into mrs shaws case 
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said there are pardons 
that are in the system but i dont have any status report on 
whether or not he has had a chance to review them 
a senior official speaking on condition he not be identified 
said reagan has pardoned 10 people in the last few weeks through the 
normal process in which the pardons are announced by the courts 
rather than by the white house 
my private guidance is not to expect anything too extraordinary 
here in the form of pardons the official said he added however 
that reagan has not made final decisions 
the official said former national security aide oliver l north 
mrs shaw and industrialist armand hammer were in the category of 
potential pardon recipients he had in mind as extraordinary 
with time running out on his twoterm presidency reagan has as 
many as a couple of dozen requests still pending said another 
source who also declined to be named 
mrs shaw 34 said earlier this week that she did not know 
whether reagan would grant her a pardon 
administration officials would not divulge the names of the 10 
pardon requests that reagan reviewed and sent back to the justice 
department there are no big names one official said 
patty hearst was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for 
her role in the 1974 armed robbery she now is married and living in 
connecticut with her husband and two daughters under the married 
name of patty hearst shaw 
shaw granddaughter of newspaper tycoon william randolph hearst 
asked for the pardon last august she has maintained that she was 
brainwashed by the radical symbionese liberation army a group of 
revolutionaries who kidnapped her in berkeley calif in february 
1974 and orchestrated the bank heist 
her sevenyear sentence was commuted by president carter and she 
was released from prison on feb 1 1979 after serving 23 months

azerbaijanis fled 105 armenian villages prior to 
the december earthquake because of ethnic strife over 
nagornokarabakh that the kremlin is trying to break by imposing 
direct rule a soviet official said 
premier nikolai i ryzhkov spent several weeks in armenia 
managing the response to the dec 7 quake and returned tuesday for 
a meeting with party officials and economic managers a report on 
the meeting was published in wednesdays communist party newspaper 
pravda 
the earthquake struck after another flareup of ethnic violence 
between azerbaijanis and armenians in the southern republics more 
than 60 people have been killed in ethnic unrest in the past year 
and 200000 people have fled the violence 
last week in order to stem the unrest the kremlin announced it 
was suspending the legislature of nagornokarabakh the region of 
azerbaijan that armenia wants to annex and impose direct kremlin 
rule 
this is a compromise under which a mutually acceptable balance 
of interests of the two republics is observed ryzhkov said 
the decision made about nagornokarabakh is no ones victory 
and no ones loss it was dictated solely to lessen tension in the 
region reestablish order give people the possibility to live 
work and raise their children normally he said 
even prior to the earthquake the azerbaijani population of 105 
armenian villages fled because of the ethnic tension he said now 
that armenia is trying to rebuild from the quake that killed about 
25000 people there is an insufficient number of people to organize 
workers and tend cattle and sheep he said 
ryzhkov and suren arutunyan communist party chief of armenia 
both partially blamed armenian intellectuals for encouraging the 
drive to annex nagornokarabakh which began with demands made by 
the primarily ethnic armenian population of the area in february 
ryzhkov said positive changes were seen in the mood of armenia 
but that in order to heal the wounds left by the violence changes 
must continue to take place from the bottom as well as directed by 
the kremlin 
on tuesday pravda said 49 communist party and government 
officials in armenia had been sacked for encouraging nationalism and 
a variety of other offenses including blackmail 
in a separate article wednesday pravda said yp kochetkov had 
been replaced as the armenian partys second secretary by oi lobov 
and was trasnferred to unspecified other work 
it said a member of the armenian politburo ft sarkisyan had 
retired and his place was taken by armenian premier vs markaryants

a clotting protein made through genetic engineering 
appears promising for people with the bleeding disease hemophilia 
and may provide an aidsfree alternative to current treatments 
researchers report 
in a report in thursdays new england journal of medicine dr 
gilbert c white ii and others from the university of north carolina 
described the first use of the genetically engineered protein in two 
people 
one of them received 44 doses while the other got 35 the 
researchers said the treatment appeared to work well 
we think it will be a blessing truly virusfree and truly 
safe said alan brownstein executive director of the hemophilia 
foundation 
hemophiliacs lack a protein called factor viii that is 
essential for making blood clots as a result they frequently 
suffer internal bleeding and must receive infusions of clotting 
protein derived from human blood 
during the early 1980s these treatments were often tainted with 
the aids virus in 1984 after that was discovered manufacturers 
began heating factor viii to kill the virus the strategy greatly 
reduced the problem but was not foolproof however many experts 
believe that adding detergents and other refinements to the 
purification process has made natural factor viii virtually free of 
aids 
to produce clotting protein that is indisputedly free of aids and 
other viruses the north carolina researchers inserted the human 
gene that controls production of factor viii into animal cells 
these cells then made the protein 
the national hemophilia foundation estimates that about 60 
percent of the nations 20000 hemophiliacs are infected with the 
virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome 
it is not known how many of those people will eventually get the 
disease currently only about 900 hemophiliacs have been reported 
to have aids slightly more than 1 percent of the nations 83000 
aids cases 
among all aids virus carriers about 20 percent and 30 percent 
can be expected to contract the disease within five years according 
to surgeon general c everett koop their longer term prospects are 
not yet known

president pw botha suffered a 
stroke at home wednesday but was clearminded and might appoint 
a cabinet member as acting president his office said 
botha who turned 73 on jan 12 was in stable condition at no 2 
military hospital in the cape town suburb of wynberg after suffering 
a mild stroke his office said no further details were released 
bothas health generally has been excellent since he took charge 
of south africas whiterun government as prime minister in 1978 
under a new constitution he became president in 1984 
elize botha the presidents wife of 46 years and some of their 
five children came to the hospital to be with him state radio said 
botha was hospitalized shortly after 8 am according to the 
south african broadcasting corp 
bothas office said he was quite clearminded and was likely 
to appoint one of his cabinet ministers as acting president on 
thursday 
according to south africas constitution the president can 
appoint a cabinet minister to fill in for him temporarily if the 
president is incapacitated the cabinet can elect one of its members 
as acting president 
botha has refused to comment on his possible retirement there 
has been intense speculation but no consensus about which cabinet 
member might be selected by the national party as bothas successor 
among those mentioned as presidential contenders are foreign 
minister pik botha who is not related to him national education 
minister fw de klerk constitutional development minister chris 
heunis finance minister barend du plessis and defense minister 
magnus malan 
none of these men is considered likely to make fundamental 
changes in current national party policy although pik botha is 
viewed as slightly more liberal than the others 
the stroke occurred a few days after botha returned to cape town 
from a monthlong holiday at his coastal vacation home on friday 
he was to meet members of namibias territorial cabinet to discuss 
the planned transition to independence by years end 
pik botha said he would chair the meeting with the namibian 
officials 
parliament is due to open feb 3 and there has been widespread 
speculation that president botha would announce a general election 
to take place in late april national party leaders have suggested 
the early election because they believe their opponents on both the 
left and right are in disarray 
during his years in power botha has maintained the national 
partys political dominance despite criticism both from the 
antiapartheid movement and from extremeright whites 
he pushed throught the first significant racial reforms 
undertaken during the national partys 40year rule such as 
legalization of interracial marriages and abolition of pass laws 
that restricted blacks movements 
but he has refused to negotiate with the african national 
congress guerrilla movement or to release the ancs jailed leader 
nelson mandela botha has said he would not even discuss the 
possibility of a oneperson onevote system in south africa where 
the 5 million whites control the government and economy while the 26 
million blacks have no vote in national affairs 
the wynberg hospital is about a mile from the constantiaberg 
clinic where mandela spent several weeks recuperating from 
tuberculosis last year before being transferred to a suburbanstyle 
staff home at a prison farm in the winegrowing town of paarl 
the hospital in wynberg part of a military base is considered 
one of the best in southern africa botha laid the cornerstone for 
the main building in 1976 when he was defense minister

secretary of statedesignate james a baker iii 
said today the united states and the soviet union are close to 
agreement on verification procedures for two longpending nuclear 
test ban treaties 
baker told the senate foreign relations committee that when all 
work on the two treaties is completed they will be submitted to the 
senate for ratification 
baker whose confirmation as secretary of state is virtually 
assured said he believes verification problems on the 1976 peaceful 
nuclear explosions treaty are completely resolved 
and he said verification procedures are close to being 
resolved on the 1974 nuclear test ban treaty which would establish 
a limit of 150 kilotons on underground tests 
testifying on the second day of his confirmation hearings baker 
also agreed to a proposal by sen joseph r biden jr ddel to 
discuss in private bidens ideas on revising and implementing the 
controversial war powers act which provides a mechanism for congress 
to reverse a presidential decision to commit us forces to combat 
or meet the threat of combat 
but declaring that i dont want to pursue this under false 
colors baker said there are many in government who feel very 
strongly that the war powers act is unconstitutional including the 
presidentelect 
biden said failure to try to reach a compromise on the issue will 
lead to an impasse every single time a president decides to 
commit us forces 
if thats your position i can assure you there will be no 
bipartisanship biden said 
but biden said there may be ways to address the constitutional 
issues and still leave a voice for congress baker said he would be 
willing to pursue the matter 
on another subject baker said the bush administration will 
maintain a high standard of insisting on human rights protection 
around the world whether abuses are committed by governments of 
the left or of the right 
responding to questions baker said he believes the bush 
adminiration will move to combat the environmental hazards poised by 
acid rain in a coordinated and responsible way 
i think youll see a new approach toward acid rain from this 
administration baker said noting bushs campaign promises on the 
issue 
he indicated bush will not move precipitously however and 
underscored the need to deal with acid rain from a national and 
international standpoint 
he told senators you have my commitment to work at the 
problem because i think it is a very serious matter 
in testimony on tuesday baker promised regular consultations 
with congressional leaders and asked for bipartisan support in 
return 
in order to succeed we simply must work together baker said 
tuesday that is the verdict of history and that is the verdict of 
recent experience 
baker ended the first of two days of confirmation hearings before 
the foreign relations panel with the endorsement of virtually every 
member 
chairman claiborne pell dri said the panel will vote on the 
baker nomination thursday morning one day before bush is sworn in 
as president the full senate will act later 
baker on tuesday used such words as prudence realism 
and caution to describe the proper us attitude to the 
startling economic and foreign policy changes championed by soviet 
president mikhail s gorbachev 
and he refused to commit the incoming bush administration to 
resuming nuclear arms control talks with the soviet union by any 
specific date even though senators repeatedly urged him to do so 
one member sen joseph r biden ddel noted that bush ran for 
president in large part on his experience in handling foreign policy 
and arms control issues contrasting himself favorably with democrat 
michael dukakis 
biden said it appeared odd to him that bush and baker should now 
contend they need an extended period to review the proper 
negotiating positions at arms control talks 
the start talks on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons have 
been recessed since november and baker said the new 
administrations approach to them is among several key policy areas 
that are under review 
baker also said he believed the strategic talks should be pursued 
on their own merits and not be linked to other issues including 
agreement on reducing conventional arms 
the united states should welcome gorbachevs reforms and any 
positive change in soviet human rights foreign policy and defense 
postures baker said 
but he cautioned the talk is different but the force 
structure and policies that support farreaching interests and 
clients have not changed commensurately many of those policies and 
those clients are hostile to american values and threaten our 
interests and our allies thats a reality

government officials who have ordered cooperatives 
out of lucrative fields such as medicine and publishing apparently 
didnt count on the high cost of buying them out a leader of coop 
movement said wednesday 
the dec 29 directive of the soviet council of ministers ordered 
some cooperatives to close by feb 1 
up to now not one coop has closed because of the decision 
and i do not know of any that show any inclination of ceasing their 
activity said vladimir yakovlev chairman of the fakt market 
research and consulting cooperative 
if the coops are closed the state will have to pay back all 
losses due to the decision i think that the people who decided to 
close the cooperatives did not calculate concretely how much it 
would cost the government he told a news conference 
the directive ordered medical and publishing coops to close as 
well as video salons which provide snacks and tea to viewers who 
watch films 
it costs between 48000 and 80000 to start a video salon in 
moscow he said 
the cost of starting a medical coop is considerably higher 
medical coops and video salons make up only about 6 percent of the 
cooperatives in moscow but the government would be forced to pay 
out a significant amount of money to buy them out yakovlev said 
the directive was based on emotion rather than economics and by 
enforcing it the government would contradict its own reform effort 
yakovlev said 
video salons were doing a booming business when the government 
decided to restrict them he said implying that if demand counts 
for little economic reform is doomed 
if the decision of the ministers becomes law the cooperative 
movement will not be able to continue yakovlev said 
president mikhail s gorbachev has encouraged development of the 
cooperative movement in all spheres although citizens themselves 
certainly would agree to restrictions regarding ventures that pose a 
risk to the public 
the decision is a most unpleasant fact in the history of the 
cooperative movement he said 
government bureaucrats as well as the general public know little 
about the economics of the cooperative movement he said 
a great deal is said about the negative attitude of the 
population toward coops the basis of this attitude is the peoples 
lack of comprehension of the laws of economics according to our 
statistics only one out of 10 persons understands how prices are 
determined in a free market and i think the decision shows that 
same lack of comprehension in the ministries and state 
organizations 
cooperatives have no way to influence events yakovlev said to 
try to remedy their lack of clout three major coop associations 
each with between 1000 and 2500 coop members plan to organize a 
union through which owners hope to be able to elect delegates to 
legislative bodies

police on wednesday made a nationwide 
appeal for information on the abduction of former prime minister 
paul vanden boeynants and his family expressed fears for his life 
in an emotional radio message 
vanden boeynants son christian said the family has received 
no sign of life of my father up to now 
we havent had the least contact with the kidnappers and thus 
there are no negotiations he said on national brt radio it was 
the first public reaction from the family since vanden boeynants 
disappeared saturday 
authorities considered broadcasting a phone call taped monday in 
which a man claiming to represent the revolutionary socialist 
brigade said the group was holding the former leader 
the caller said the brigade would return vanden boeynants in 
little pieces investigators hope the public might be able to 
identify the voice 
the brigade demanded the equivalent of 789000 in a letter to 
two newspapers but did not provide proof it actually held the 
69yearold politician or that he was still alive 
officials have expressed concern about the health of vanden 
boeynants who needs heart medicine when under stress 
my mother my sister and myself are very worried christian 
vanden boeynants said on the radio 
anyone who has information on this subject is asked to contact 
the coordination center the police appeal said it was 
distributed by the national news agency belga 
the brigade said in a letter to the brussels newspapers le soir 
and het laatste nieuws on tuesday that the politician will have to 
appear before a peoples tribunal for corruption and alleged 
misuse of funds and could face the supreme sanction 
vanden boeynants received a threeyear suspended sentence in 1986 
for financial fraud as head of his meat packaging business and is 
under parliamentary investigation for allegedly accepting bribes as 
defense minister in the 1970s 
the brigade called vanden boeynants a corrupt person who 
has stolen large public funds for his own profit 
about 10 claims of responsibilty have been made since vanden 
boeynants disappeared but in most cases the authenticity was 
doubtful said deputy brussels prosecutor andre vandoren 
the brigade demanded that twothirds of the ransom money go to 
relief agencies 
experts of leftwing terrorism said the groups letter was 
amateurish such poor language wouldnt be tolerated by groups 
like the red army faction the red brigades or action directe 
said rudolf boehm a professor at ghent university 
vanden boeynants disappeared near his home in a posh brussels 
neighborhood late saturday the cover of a syringe found near his 
home had traces of a tranquilizer 
vanden boeynants was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and again 
from late 1978 until early 1979 and was also defense minister for 
seven years in the 1970s

reelected in october 
as public works alderman in brussels he razed several old 
neighborhoods to make way for highrise buildings and brussels 
became known for its destructive urban renewal the brigade letter 
named a brussels construction company as one of vanden boeynants 
business partners who must help contribute funds to the ransom

found a home 
as bushs choice to run the party the 37yearold south 
carolinian was elected chairman without opposition for a twoyear 
term 
he succeeded frank j fahrenkopf jr who served as chairman of 
the republican national committee for six years the longest tenure 
in this century 
in his speech to the committee atwater described the gop 
victories in the last three presidential elections as the triumph 
of an idea we are heirs to a political movement that offers new 
hope to millions of americans 
the new party chairman said bushs victory over democrat michael 
dukakis was because we have better ideas and we had the best 
candidate 
but he also said the party now must strive to control the 
redistricting process under which legislative districts at the 
state and federal levels will be redrawn in 1991 to conform to 
population shifts determined by the 1990 census 
atwater said the republicans also must work to attract 
minorities to reach into communities where the republican message 
has not yet found a home 
we have been fighting with one arm tied behind our back 
because the democrats have succeeded in virtually cornering the 
votes of whole segments of american society he said citing 
blacks hispanics asians and the disabled 
our program of low taxes and economic growth of standards in 
schools and safer streets has a great appeal to americans of all 
colors and backgrounds he said 
bush and vice presidentelect dan quayle appeared briefly at a 
republican committee luncheon and the presidentelect endorsed 
atwaters outreach program 
i like the concept that our party needs to have a broader base 
a stronger participation he said 
bush said atwater will be my political eyes and ears im 
here to say i want to work with the party 
as he left office fahrenkopf also emphasized the need to control 
the redistricting process and pointed out that in the 1988 election 
98 percent of house members who sought reelection were victorious 
he asked why is it that today there is more change in the 
supreme soviet of the ussr than there is in the american house 
of representatives 
fahrenkopf said according to the state department the supreme 
soviet recently returned 961 percent of its members 
when bush designated atwater as his choice to head the committee 
he said hes a friend im proud of his accomplishments 
political rivals claim atwaters accomplishments often are 
tainted by roughhouse tactics 
hes got a toughguy image said south carolina gop chairman 
van hipp i think lee enjoys it to be honest with you 
for most of the 165 republican committee members the meeting was 
a routine piece of business leading up to the inauguration of bush 
on friday and the round of parties keyed to that event 
in recent interviews atwater said a top priority would be trying 
to expand the partys appeal to blacks hispanics asians and the 
handicapped 
while getting 53 percent of the overall vote in the 1988 election 
and carrying 40 states bush received only 12 percent of the black 
vote according to a new york timescbs poll that was marginally 
better than reagan who attracted the votes of 11 percent of blacks 
in 1980 and nine percent in 1984 
among hispanics the bush total was estimated at about 30 
percent down from reagans totals of 35 percent in 1980 and 37 
percent in 1984 
atwater paid tribute to martin luther king jr recently as an 
american hero the incoming gop chairman was bushs representative 
at ceremonies marking kings birthday at the ebenezer baptist church 
in atlanta where the late civil rights leader was pastor 
bush used similar language when he spoke at a prayer breakfast 
monday the national holiday marking kings birth 
the presidentelect said king lived a heros life he dreamed a 
heros imagination of a great nation 
a private panel called the citizens commission on civil rights 
issued a report tuesday that criticized the reagan administration 
for a complete breakdown of endorsement of civil rights laws 
chairman arthur flemming said the group was sending its report to 
bush in the hope that he can turn around the 80s as far as civil 
rights enforcement is concerned

it costs a pretty penny to ride in style around 
the nations capital this inaugural week and even wealthy wouldbe 
power travelers may find themselves hailing taxicabs if they 
procrastinate 
limousine operators report capacity or nearcapacity bookings for 
the week one has switched its phones over to an answering service 
whose operators deliver the news they are booked solid 
those fortunate enough to find a limousine are paying to keep it 
at their disposal because of demand most washingtonarea companies 
are leasing on a three or fourday basis with the car and 
chauffeur on call eight to 10 hours each day 
the cost 2700 at presidential limousine service there is an 
alternative package referred to among the incrowd as sans 
stretch translation for 1600 one can rent a car and driver for 
four days but the car will be a lincoln town car sedan not the 
stretch limousine that comes with the pricier deal 
some companies are charging more some a bit less its really 
a sellers market said presidentials herta mullens 
some wouldbe clients have special requests 
a lot have asked for bodyguards said mullens we call it 
executive protection but theyre essentially bodyguards 
high rollers who dont need a limo for four days but want a 
classy ride to a single event may find it tough to find one but 
not surprisingly where theres a wallet theres a way 
if they are willing to pay the price no one will go home 
unhappy mullens said with a little shuffling i can get someone 
from their hotel to a ball for 1000 
the ballbound appear undeterred by the cost 
they pause for a while when they hear the price said 
mullens and then say ok put me down

many of the highpowered republicans who came to washington to 
see george bush become president evidently were a bit hesitant about 
his chances until the pollsters told them to relax and reserve 
all 240 rooms and suites at the capitals plush ritzcarlton are 
booked including one offered as part of a 15000 inaugural package 
the hotel proudly boasted included the most expensive hotel room 
in washington 
but bookings were slow for a while hotel spokeswoman vivian 
deuschl said the pace of reservations for the inaugural appeared 
tied to bushs lead in the preelection polls 
every time bush went up in the polls we got more phone calls 
ms deuschl said then when everybody was saying it was all over 
we started getting requests for room blocks 
by election day the ritz was booked for inaugural week 
the least expensive room is 290 a night with a fournight 
minimum this week those lucky enough to land a suite pay between 
800 and 1200 a night 
among the ritzs registered guests is real estate mogul donald 
trump who apparently signed up for the fournight minimum although 
he plans to spend just two nights in washington arriving thursday 
attending the swearingin ceremony friday and one of the balls that

police burst into a church vestry 
wednesday and dragged away a sri lankan seeking political asylum an 
action one critic called an act of savagery against the ancient 
right to sanctuary 
viraj mendis an activist who says he fears persecution or death 
if he returns home had handcuffed himself to a radiator when 16 
police and two immigration agents broke into the church of the 
ascension in the rundown hulme district police said 
police cut mendis handcuffs with acetylene torches and a 
witness said the 32yearold screamed murderers murderers as 
they took him to a london prison to await deportation scheduled for 
friday 
officials said mendis who had been living in the church since 
receiving a deportation order two years ago would be sent home 
unless a third country accepted him 
the fact that someone is in a church does not give them any 
immunity from the law home secretary douglas hurd told a noisy 
session of parliament 
some opposition lawmakers shouted sieg heil and kgb 
three spectators one shouting do not send him to his death 
were thrown out of the public gallery 
but other politicians cheered as hurd the minister responsible 
for immigration affairs warned the church to think carefully 
before it enters into any habit or custom of giving shelter to those 
defying the law 
home office minister timothy renton said the government always 
felt that the situation in sri lanka did not justify the position 
that mendis and his supporters were adopting 
mendis a member of his nations sinhalese majority says his 
life is threatened by his political activism on behalf of communism 
and the tamil minority he came to britain in 1973 as a student 
his supporters said mendis removal from the church violated his 
rights and endangered his life about 200 people marched in protest 
in this northern england city 
under english common law a person accused of committing a crime 
could take sanctuary in a church but had to surrender or leave the 
country in 40 days the provision was abolished in 1623 but mendis 
supporters used the ancient right as a last resort to argue his case 
people seeking sanctuary like this have never been dealt with 
like this by violence before said opposition labor party 
legislator keith vaz as a christian i say it is an act of 
savagery which is a disgrace 
the human rights group amnesty international told hurd that 
mendis would be at risk of torture or ill treatment arrest and 
prolonged detention without charge if he returned home 
an advisory body to the roman catholic church issued a statement 
that did not mention mendis but said asylum seekers from sri 
lanka should not be sent back because of ethnic strife 
the committee for community relations of the catholic bishops 
conference headed by bishop leo mccartie of birmingham said the 
situation in sri lanka is now so serious that governments should 
clearly risk erring on the side of caution lest lives be necessarily 
be lost 
mendis lawyer david burgess said his client also feared 
sinhalese groups fighting tamil demands for an independent state 
chandra monerawela the sri lankan high commissioner to london 
said mendis is an unknown entity in sri lanka he is not wanted 
for any criminal or civil offense 
burgess said he will challenge the deportation in the european 
court of human rights although his client already has lost two 
immigration appeals last month britains highest court the law 
lords refused to hear the case 
the rev john methuen the vicar whose church gave mendis asylum 
said police broke into his home cut telephone and burglar alarm 
wires and smashed in the door of the vestry where mendis slept 
there is quite a lot of damage to the building he said 
church council member ingrid falat said police cut mendis free 
and carried him away 
greater manchester assistant chief constable david phillips 
however described the operation as lowkey and denied that 
police had cut telephone or alarm wires he offered to repair the 
damaged doors 
methuen and the bishop of hulme the rt rev colin scott said 
the governments action will jeopardize mendis chances of getting 
asylum outside britain

frances and hsinyi lee have spent two 
weeks shuttling between lawyers offices the prosecutors office and 
a hospital where their son thomas is in a coma from 
cyanidepoisoning 
their lives have been subject to microscopic scrutiny 
investigators have even rifled through their kitchen garbage and 
their telephone rings incessantly 
this is a real nightmare for an otherwise private family 
said dr robert nagele a family friend but now every aspect of 
their life has been made very public 
thomas 17 a junior at haddonfield memorial high school has 
been in critical condition and on lifesupport machinery at west 
jersey hospitalvoorhees since jan 3 when he ate black cherry 
yogurt laced with cyanide 
on thursday a guardian appointed to represent thomas welfare 
must file court papers over whether his lifesupport machines should 
be disconnected hospital officials have painted a dismal picture of 
his chances of recovery 
police have not ruled out attempted homicide or suicide but they 
say one thing is almost certain the yogurt package was not tampered 
with at the factory or the store 
the lees have adamantly insisted in statements released through 
attorneys that their son would not have tried to kill himself and 
that he was too popular to be the target of a slaying 
camden county prosecutor samuel asbell said last week the boys 
parents and brother were not targets of the investigation into how 
the cyanide got into the carton of yogurt 
but family members were fingerprinted this week and two fbi 
agents fingerprinted thomas at the hospital saturday said george 
kerns a spokesman for asbell 
kerns said investigators wanted the fingerprints for comparison 
to items taken from the lee home and the fathers laboratory at 
rutgers university in camden where he is chairman of the biology 
department 
asbell declined to describe the items under investigation but 
the us food and drug administration has said a tiny plastic vial 
of cyanide was found at the lee home asbell has declined to confirm 
or deny whether cyanide was found at the elder lees laboratory 
in the meantime nagele a former student of lee and now 
professor of pediatrics at the university of medicine and dentistry 
of new jersey in camden has tried to shield the family from 
reporters 
they deserve a little peace he said people are forgetting 
that tommys still on life support their thoughts should be with 
him 
theyre just heartbroken said attorney alan turner i 
think theyre experiencing what any parents would experience upon 
such a tragedy 
lee 53 came to the united states from taiwan in 1961 and earned 
his doctorate from the university of minnesota he became a 
professor at rutgers in 1968 and is recognized as an expert on early 
brain development 
students are always trying to beat down the door to get in his 
lab said nagele who worked in lees lab for five years and is 
currently collaborating with him on a number of projects 
outside of his work lee has few hobbies or pastimes his wife 
frances also a taiwanese immigrant who holds a masters degree in 
immunology from eastern illinois has primarily been a homemaker 
since the birth of thomas 
they have done the best over the years to the point of 
spoiling their boys said nagele they were very devoted to 
their children 
thomas brother bruce 20 is a student at harvard university 
they were always together nagele said there was no direct 
competition 
the brothers have been popular outgoing students 
thomas a 160pound wrestler had so much going for him said 
classmate zachary resnicoff captain of the schools wrestling team 
he has lots of friends and likes school 
nagele and school officials described thomas as a good student 
and a gifted artist and musician 
hes a super kid said head wrestling coach joe frassenei 
hes very bright wellliked by his teammates

an internal audit by the agriculture department 
says that federal control of illegally high traces of pesticides and 
other chemicals in the nations meat and poultry supply has been 
slipshod and sometimes ineffective 
the investigators found that in some cases meat and poultry 
containing too much of these chemical residues slipped through and 
got into the consumer pipeline 
even when animals were presented to inspectors agency 
administrative controls and current policies did not ensure timely 
and effective response when pesticide residue was suspected or found 
in meat and poultry products the report said as a result some 
adulterated products were allowed to enter commerce 
the report by the departments office of inspector general said 
the departments inspection agency the food safety and inspection 
service or fsis has little authority to prevent pesticide 
residues from showing up in meat and poultry 
accordingly the fsis has turned to the food industry itself for 
cooperation in monitoring levels of chemicals and ferreting out 
violations 
the agencys chief responsibility is to ensure that 
usdainspected meat and poultry products are safe wholesome and 
free of adulterating chemicals as part of its responsibility the 
agency samples and analyzes edible tissues to see if they meet the 
federal standards 
but the system is far from foolproof and the agency also 
includes efforts to enlighten farmers and processors about the 
federal standards and how to comply with them 
the report which was completed last november but not given wide 
distribution by the department said fsis was unable to 
successfully investigate pesticide violations in 79 percent of the 
cases reviewed by the auditors a violation was defined as an 
illegal level of chemical residue found in a sample of meat or 
poultry 
some of the reasons for the lack of success in investigating 
violations included 
tracing the illegal residue to the original producer was not 
always successful 
followup samples from suspected meat were seldom taken or else 
the suspected animals or carcasses were not always retained for 
further checking 
documentation of regulatory actions was insufficient 
starting in june 1986 when a company signed a memorandum of 
understanding with fsis it agreed to upgrade its own quality 
control procedures was exempted from routine monitoring by the 
agency and placed under a lessintensive monitoring program 
in addition these companies became eligible to make certain 
claims on their product labels concerning chemical residue levels 
or superior quality control procedures the report said 
by 1988 this verified production control program included 11 
companies and 34 slaughter plants out of a us total of 1800 
plants the participating plants had an annual slaughter of about 5 
billion pounds or about 8 percent of all animals slaughtered last 
year 
in all the agency is responsible for inspection in more than 
7000 meat and poultry slaughter and processing plants 
the usda investigators visited 96 federally inspected meat and 
poultry plants and conducted research at the agencys national 
office three regional offices three field laboratories and five 
usdaaccredited laboratories 
one of the major problems uncovered is the identification of the 
original farmer feedlot operator or other producer of livestock 
that have been found to be in violation of the federal residue 
levels 
the report recommended that the agency seek legislation for 
mandatory identification of the source of all animal species 
slaughter for domestic food consumption however fsis responded 
that such a move be directed to policymakers not the regulatory 
agency itself 
lester m crawford fsis administrator said that historically 
the agency has pursued animal identification as a related part of 
the residue testing program 
we recently were successful in obtaining a swine identification 
program outside of the legislative route and would strongly support 
similar identification for the other species which come under our 
jurisdiction crawford said in a response to the report

he used the occasion a gathering of 500 gop officials from 
around the country to pay tribute to president reagan 
i dont believe id be standing here as presidentelect of the

300000 celebrants bush and his wife barbara moved out of the 
official residence theyve occupied for the last eight years on the 
grounds of the naval observatory off massachusetts avenue

halffilled crate and she puts me to work and shes mean and tough 
and ugly about it she doesnt show any understanding and so shes

point to highlight bushs campaign theme of a thousand points of 
light 
the most exclusive social event of the whole inaugural was 
tonights blacktie inaugural dinner with tickets priced at 1500 
a plate yet the demand was so heavy that organizers had to split 
it up into three dinners at different sites all being attended by 
bush 
advocates of the poor and homeless were staging a 
counterinaugural banquet at one of the dinner sites in protest of 
the pricey tickets mitch snyder an activist for the poor 
challenged corporations that are underwriting the cost of bushs

japanese downed his bomber in the pacific in 1944 he also was 
working to fill out highlevel jobs in his administration

engeleiter 36 a wisconsin state senator who lost the race for a 
us senate seat last november as head of the small business 
administration

cousins are occupying 90 of the hotels 100 rooms this week as they

are throwing a few parties of their own the family reunion will 
culminate with a white house lunch for 250 relatives on saturday 
the first full day the new president and first lady will spend in 
their new home 
the nomadic couple billed as having moved 28 times in a 44year 
marriage wont make their 29th move until friday after bush has 
taken his oath of office and their personal belongings arent due 
to arrive at the white house until monday 
but they left the vice presidential residence wednesday for a 
twoday transitional stay in blair house the governments quarters 
for visiting dignitaries 
our house looks like yours do whenever you make a move bush 
told a group of teachers referring to the official residence on the 
grounds of the us naval observatory its a real wasteland out 
there this morning 
blair house four connected rowhouses across pennsylvania avenue 
from the white house is designed to house 19 guests the bushes 
will number 22 counting children spouses grandchildren and the 
presidentelects mother dorothy 87 
the whole crew will move to the white house with the first couple 
on friday and bushs mother only the 12th presidential mom to see

which belongings would go to the white house which to camp david 
which to the summer house in kennebunkport and which into storage 
weve got dots on everything she told reporters last week 
referring to her system denoting which items are going where the 
move had been exciting but also agony she said maybe because

mrs bush they wanted to be with their family and there was no 
way the vice presidents residence could accomodate everybody 
vice presidentelect dan quayle his wife marilyn and their three 
children are expected to move into the official residence early next 
month renovations for the young family are not expected to be 
complete by then but the secret service is anxious to install them 
there as soon as possible 
they cant compete with the bushes but the quayles are no 
slouches in the relative department quayle put the latest count at 
117 coming for the inauguration 
i think some of them we asked for their birth certificates 
quayle joked they started calling up and saying i am a relative 
of the senator and i said oh so we were going to have a 
genealogist check their birth certificate and the tree and all that 
but no he added hastily well be glad to see them all 
according to haley the 200plus bush relatives are people the 
presidentelect and his wife have been in touch with over the years 
and many have been guests at the familys summer home in 
kennebunkport maine 
we get enormous strength from our family mrs bush said 
during her session with reporters not just our children and 
granchildren but our brothers and sisters its always been like 
that and more so now

the nationally syndicated sally jessy 
raphael talk show may leave new haven for a new haven 
wtnhtv station manager lew freifield said tuesday that 
discussions had been held about relocating the show closer to new 
york because of travel problems for raphael who lives in 
westchester county ny and new york city 
the talk show shown on more than 90 stations nationwide has 
been taped at the downtown new haven television station since june 
1987 
raphaels weekly commute from new york to st louis was a major 
reason for the shows relocation to new haven from ksdktv in st 
louis 
the shows executive producer burt dubrow would not say why the 
show is considering the move but he denied it was because of the 
hourplus commute raphael must make and he discounted reports of 
space parking and audience problems at the abc affiliate 
dubrow said the show is merely exploring all kinds of options 
that might be available when its contract to lease space and 
production services from wtnh expires in june 1990 
dubrow and freifield would not rule out a move before 1990

the bulletproof shield to protect george bush 
when he takes the presidential oath of office friday is in place 
the manhole covers along the parade route are welded shut virtually 
every police agency in town has canceled all days off 
welcome to washington the inaugural city where protestors are 
ready to demonstrate for their own version of a kinder gentler 
nation and authorities hope theyre ready for whatever transpires 
we intend to be everywhere lisa fithian a spokeswoman for 
the counterinaugural coalition for a peoples agenda told a news 
conference wednesday we will be a reminder of the urgency of not 
just a kinder gentler nation but a kinder gentler less insulated 
government 
but she said the coalitions 80 groups ranging from the student 
coalition against apartheid and racism to environmental action 
have agreed not to conduct any civil disobedience 
anyone going anywhere the first families might go will be checked 
with metal detectors that includes for the first time the 150000 
invited guests at the capitol swearingin ceremonies even if 
theyll be sitting hundreds of yards away 
that bit of security has upset sen wendell ford dky chairman 
of the joint congressional committee on inaugural ceremonies 
security is something that bothers me considerably he said 
tuesday were a free and open nation insisting that those in the 
inner circle go through megadetectors 
the west side of the capitol where bush will take the oath has 
been secured for a week 
starting tonight the capitol itself will be offlimits to all 
unauthorized people friday all streets within a twoblock radius 
will be closed with even members of congress told not to use their 
normal parking spaces on the capitol grounds 
many security details remained secret even as the celebrations 
got under way wednesday 
we certainly wouldnt want to give anyone who had harmful 
intent any kind of advantage said secret service spokesman ken 
lynch 
reports on previous inaugurations have indicated that agents 
carrying shoulderfired stinger missiles to protect against air 
attack were on the capitol roof 
the agencies involved refused to say if that would be the case 
this year although bob buckhorn of the federal aviation 
administration noted that flying over the white house or the capitol 
is normally a violation of federal air regulations 
flying over those places during the inauguration would be an 
extreme gross violation buckhorn said the secret service 
frowns on those kinds of violations 
bush will ride in an armored limousine along the parade route 
from the capitol to the white house after he takes the oath 
according to everyone willing to talk about it 
but then thats what all they said about president carter before 
he and his wife rosalynn climbed out of their car and walked the 
1 miles down pennsylvania avenue in january 1977 
jody powell carters press secretary said in a recent interview 
that his boss told him about his plans a week before the 
inauguration but that the news was very tightly held for security 
purposes 
what he told me at the time was the deal was the secret service 
wasnt going to fight it as long as it was kept secret but if word 
got out ahead of time theyd be very opposed to it powell said 
the secret service will be ready to protect bush if he too 
decides to stroll down the parade route says spokesman rich adams 
but he admitted the agents would not be too happy about it 
if we had our way he would not leave the white house adams 
said 
even from the white house the new president will be able to see 
protestors 
a corner of lafayette park across pennsylvania avenue from 
bushs new home has been set aside for demonstrations to ensure 
first amendment rights in the words of park police capt michael 
barrett 
planning to protest along the parade route are the 
counterinaugural coalition and its member groups as well as the 
national organization for women which has announced a silent 
protest 
law enforcement agencies involved in security for the inaugural 
ceremonies include the secret service capitol police the district 
of columbia police department metro transit police park police 
federal protective service and the district of columbia national 
guard

energy secretary john herrington today 
officially named texas as the site of the 59 billion 
superconducting super collider project 
texas has been chosen as the site because it is the superior 
site herrington told a ceremony at the department of energy 
attended by texas gov bill clements 
herrington had already declared on nov 10 that texas was the 
preferred site for the massive physics installation at which 
scientists plan to explore the nature of matter and energy 
the facility is to be called the ronald reagan center for 
highenergy physics 
despite protests from states that lost out in bids for the 
project herrington signed a record of decision making the 
choice official 
the collider a 53mile tunnel in which subatomic particles can 
be accelerated to high speeds is to be built around the texas city 
of waxahachie 
herringtons decision to make the ellis county site official had 
to wait 30 days following release of the does final environmental 
impact statement for the seven finalist states completion of that 
statement hinged on the choice of a preferred site 
congress must still authorize construction of the super collider 
and members are predicting a tough battle over funding this year 
democratic sens paul simon of illinois and dennis deconcini of 
arizona are among those who have requested the general accounting 
office to review the energy departments site selection process and 
determine if the decision was based on politics over merit 
deconcini spokesman bob maynes said the gao report is expected 
sometime in february 
we knew realistically our best hope for evaluating the doe 
decision was by congress and not the administration our best hope 
for a check on the process lies in the gao report and action by 
congress to send the decision back to the drawing board said 
simon spokesman david carle 
last year congress agreed to spend 100 million on the super 
collider but decreed that none of the money be spent on 
construction 
president reagans budget for the next fiscal year recommends 
250 million for the collider 90 million of that for research and 
development and 160 million for initial construction 
but presidentelect bush has not yet indicated whether he will go 
along with the 250 million figure or if he favors authorizing 
construction

stunned elementary school students 
returned to classes today one day after a young drifter with a 
rifle opened fire on a schoolyard jammed with laughing children 
killing five and wounding 30 before committing suicide 
patrick edward purdy wearing a military flak jacket and 
earplugs killed himself with a bullet to the head after firing up 
to 110 rounds from a sovietdesigned ak47 assault rifle at hundreds 
of youngsters on recess tuesday at cleveland elementary school the 
five slain were children of refugees from southeast asia 
purdy who had a long criminal record attended the school from 
kindergarten through third grade from 1969 to 1973 school 
officials said today 
there was no apparent motive in the shootings 
as children returned to their campus today they were greeted by 
bouquets atop the school sign on the front lawn and five red roses 
at its base across the street a 3footby9foot paper sign read 
racists are ugly lets stop them 
there was no indication that racism was involved in the attack 
im shocked its just horrible said purdys grandmother 
63yearold julia chumbley of nearby lodi i dont understand why 
and i probably wont ever know why 
purdy 26 who most recently listed his grandmothers address as 
home began his assault shortly before noon when he parked his 
station wagon behind the school the car burst into flames in a fire 
possibly set as a diversion said deputy police chief lucian neely 
then the 5foot11 140pound killer entered the campus through a 
hole in a fence with the bayonetequipped semiautomatic and two 
handguns and walked to several portable classrooms about 250 yards 
from the main lshaped building he opened fire from the west side 
of the portable buildings then moved to the east side and continued 
spraying the screaming children before turning his 9mm handgun on 
himself 
police capt dennis perry said the gunman wore a flak jacket and 
jeans on his shirt were the words death to the great satin an 
apparent reference to satan and a phrase used by iranian 
fundamentalists to refer to the united states the fbi was trying to 
determine if purdy had a military background 
during a search of purdys motel room police found about 100 
plastic toy soldiers tanks and jeeps spread across the floor in 
formations perry said 
obviously he had a military hangup of some kind perry said 
mary gonzales superintendent of the stockton unified school 
district said psychiatrists counselors and bilingual volunteers 
wearing yellow armbands were on hand when classes began this morning 
the main focus of our efforts is going to be on counseling 
she said on cbs this morning 
he was just standing there with a gun making wide sweeps 
recalled lori mackey who teaches deaf students in one of the 
portable classrooms at the school about 80 miles southeast of san 
francisco 
he was not talking he was not yelling he was very 
straightfaced it did not look like he was really angry she 
said it was just matteroffactly 
there was mass chaos there were kids running in every 
direction 
purdy who also was known as patrick west and eddie purdy west 
had an extensive criminal record said neely many of the crimes 
were committed in the los angeles area and included soliciting for 
sex and narcotics and weapons violations neely said 
the dead children were shot in the schoolyard and two were 
dragged inside by fleeing teachers he said 
as police cleaned up the carnage a large handgun and the assault 
rifle were seen lying on the ground near a pool of blood written on 
the pistols handle was the word victory the letters ssa were 
printed on the rifles clip in letters 1 inches long 
police said the word hezbollah the name of a shiite moslem 
terrorist organization was carved on one side of purdys rifle and 
the word freedom on the other perry said 
it suggests that this guy may have had delusions of grandeur 
about iran perry said 
th assault rifle purdy used apparently was purchased in oregon in 
august authorities said it is a soviet design but chinese 
replicas are available in many gun stores for around 300 it is 
capable of firing about 40 rounds per minute 
a semiautomatic rifle can be purchased easily in oregon without 
even the fiveday waiting period required for a handgun if the 
buyer signs a federal form stating he has never been convicted of a 
serious crime or indicted among other requirements said bob imel 
a salem ore gun shop owner 
you use it for one purpose and one purpose only to kill a 
human being said los angeles police lt fred nixon 
the torched car was registered to patrick e purdy who lived 
with an aunt and uncle from july through october in sandy ore 
she told me he was a loner and as a child he was an 
alcoholic sandy police chief fred punzel said of his conversation 
with the aunt julie michael 
punzel said michael told him purdy left oregon for a job as a 
boilermaker in texas that job fell through and he went to memphis 
tenn the aunt and uncle last heard from him at thanksgiving when 
he was in connecticut punzel said 
he seemed like a real nice young man said nextdoor neighbor 
pat thomas 45 who met purdy in sandy last summer he was here 
looking for work 
purdys father patrick benjamin purdy was a vietnam veteran who 
was killed in a traffic accident in september 1981 purdys parents 
married in stockton they later were divorced and his mother 
retained custody 
purdy began drifting about 10 years ago crisscrossing the 
nation looking for work his grandmother said he visited her 
occasionally and used her address to receive mail 
neely identified the dead students as raphanar or 9 a boy and 
girls ram chun 8 thuy tran 6 sokhim an 6 and oeun lim 8 all 
were children of refugee families from southeast asia southeast 
asian pupils make up about 60 percent of the schools enrollment of 
1000 pupils in grades kindergarten through 6th grade 
the wounded included 29 pupils the most seriously injured was a 
6yearold boy who was shot in the groin he was listed in serious 
condition a teacher and 17 pupils were listed as stable hospital 
officials said tuesday night the others either were treated at the

prison inmates have no right to challenge or 
have explained to them prohibitions on having visitors a lawyer for 
kentuckys prison system told the supreme court wednesday 
a decision to bar visitors is one of the daily management 
problems prison officials deal with that do not give rise to any 
special rights for inmates state lawyer barbara willett jones of 
frankfort ky argued 
but joseph elder ii a louisville lawyer representing inmates 
contended that kentuckys prison visitation program created a 
liberty interest for inmates that cannot be infringed on without 
due process 
the right arises out of regulations in place elder said 
the high court is expected to announce a decision in the case by 
july its ruling likely will affect prison visitation policies in 
many states 
thirtytwo other states are supporting kentuckys appeal urging 
the justices to clarify what rights if any inmates have in such 
cases 
a federal appeals court ruled for the inmates but did not say 
what kind of due process perhaps a written explanation or some 
type of hearing is required when visits are prohibited 
the kentucky controversy dates back to a lawsuit inmates of the 
kentucky state reformatory in lagrange filed over conditions there 
the suit resulted in a 1980 consent decree in which the state 
agreed among other things to continue its open visitation 
policy 
state officials subsequently adopted guidelines and procedures 
for handling prison visits 
in 1985 after several inmates complained about being barred from 
having visitors a classaction lawsuit was filed in behalf of all 
the prisons inmates the suit contended that suspension of 
visitation privileges without a dueprocess hearing was unlawful 
mrs jones asked the justices to draw a line between those 
procedures which affect the daily operations of a prison from those 
which affect the length or nature of confinement when requiring 
states to give inmates due process 
she said denial of visitation privileges does not rise to the 
level of affecting length or nature of confinement and therefore 
should not give rise to any dueprocess right 
several members of the high court seemed dubious 
justice sandra day oconnor noting that some might say seeing 
visitors is vitally important to a prisoners existence said 
the distinction mrs jones sought is not an easy line to draw 
chief justice william h rehnquist complained that your line 
seems so wavy and justice antonin scalia asked is it a line 
that makes any sense 
when justice john paul stevens asked whether providing inmates 
with a written explanation for denied visitation would be a big 
administrative burden mrs jones said it would not 
but she said creation of such a dueprocess right would leave all 
prison officials open to civil rights lawsuits alleging violation of 
that right 
the case is kentucky department of corrections vs thompson

us roman catholicisms socialservice arm 
catholic charities on wednesday launched a system of raising money 
to help the needy through credit cards 
the plan is called project caritas latin for generous love 
half of 1 percent of the amount charged on a specially endorsed 
caritas mastercard credit card will be channeled by 
participating banks to the churchs work among the deprived 
the rev thomas j harvey of washington dc executive director 
of catholic charities usa called it a creative way of 
bolstering efforts at lessening human suffering 
it will help us in our mission of protecting human dignity 
he said 
the plan was described at a news conference as the first of its 
kind by a major national religious organization 
however other nonprofit groups devoted to such causes as the 
environment college alumni associations or higher education also 
participate in such affinity credit card programs 
officials at the news conference said the national conference of 
synagogue youth also has begun such a program and others are being 
considered by the salvation army and young mens christian 
association 
catholic charities embraces a nationwide network of branches 
helping about 7 million people annually at a cost of about 1 
billion 
auxiliary bishop joseph sullivan of brooklyn representing us 
bishops termed the new plan a very responsible way to raise 
money and to get the message out of aid to the homeless hungry 
sick children and other needy 
harvey estimated that at least 20000 people would use the new 
card the first year increasing to 250000 in five years when it 
would funnel an estimated 4 million a year into church charities

organization magna carda inc of alexandria va with two issuing 
banks state street bank and trust of boston and first financial 
savings association of milwaukee

of charges we are not encouraging debt he said 
noting that catholic charities serve the needy without regard to 
creed with 75 percent of help going to noncatholics he said the 
card was being promoted ecumenically among all people of good 
will

jimmy carter had the killer rabbit to contend 
with and jerry ford was perceived as prone to bumping his head on 
helicopter doors but after all these years the two former 
presidents say they dont know why they got such lousy press 
presidents nixon johnson ford and i had bad relations with 
the press reagan had good relations said carter on wednesday 
why i dont know 
carter and ford took part in a discussion at columbia university 
on the press the presidency and the first hundred days they 
agreed that when it comes to relations with the news media george 
bush will find ronald reagan a hard act to follow 
reagan was treated with kid gloves by the press ford said and 
carter thinks reagan got away with staying aloof from tough issues 
a tribute to his acuity 
carter said he had unsuccessful relationships with the press he 
said he spent weeks trying to deflect attention from a story that a 
rabbit had swum out to his boat as he was fishing and that he had to 
beat it back with oars 
how can you control something like that cartr asked the 
rabbit story he said gave an image of an incompetent president 
who could not even protect himself against a rabbit 
he said that ford was the best athlete ever in the white 
house but that ford was dogged by stories about his golf balls 
hitting bystanders and his clumsiness generally it hurt him 
politically carter said 
ford said news people who accompanied him on ski trips to vail 
fell as much on the slopes as he did but nobody took pictures of 
them 
the images are hurtful he said but its part of what they 
think the public wants 
ford said that when bush takes the oath of office this week he 
will start out with the best atmosphere since relations between the 
press and reagan in recent weeks have been pleasant

considered the most widespread case of public corruption in vermont 
history was sentenced wednesday to a minimum of two years in jail 
judge francis mccaffrey sentenced the former bennington school 
superintendent to jail terms of three to seven years on each count 
the terms to be served concurrently with a minimum of two years 
behind bars 
sleeman 58 was convicted last fall of eight counts of 
embezzlement and one count of false swearing all stemming from 
allegations he used school money for personal uses 
mccaffrey ordered sleeman to make 8425 in restitution and to 
perform 1000 hours of community service 
prosecutors had urged mccaffrey to give sleeman five to 10 years 
in jail while sleemans lawyer argued for no jail term saying his 
client had suffered enough 
sleeman was convicted of embezzling 4285 in rent checks from 
two school bank accounts for building space he leased and of lying 
about the rent checks during a february 1986 inquest into the 
bennington school scandal 
his conviction came in the first of four trials he faces on a 
series of charges that were prompted by the discovery in 1984 of a 
2 million deficit in the bennington school district 
in all sleeman is charged with embezzling 20000 and a car he 
has yet to be tried on 21 embezzlement counts and three counts of 
false swearing stemming from state inquests in which he allegedly 
lied about his use of school funds 
four former topranking school officials have been punished for 
their part in the scandal though none has received jail time

the defense department has an ambitious 
schedule for developing a rail garrison system for the mx missile 
according to a congressional agency report that says there could be 
cost and performance problems if the program is not closely 
supervised 
the general accounting office an investigating arm of congress 
said in a report this week that the departments acquisition 
strategy for the rail garrison system calls for the start of 
production two years before development contracts have been 
completed 
this overlap between production and development known as 
concurrency must be well planned and controlled the gao said 
otherwise it can cause cost schedule and performance problems 
as demonstrated in other air force acquisition programs 
in addition the gao said that by march 1990 when the department 
must make an initial production decision on the rail garrison only 
about two years of the systems planned fouryear test program will 
have been completed 
most systems integration testing all basing verification 
missile flight tests and most of the operational test and 
evaluation effort will remain to be done said the gao 
the defense department in comments included in the gao report 
concurred with all of the agencys findings it added that the 
department believes the system of launching missiles from the rails 
is similar to silo launches and does not require special tests 
under the rail garrison system 50 missiles would be placed on 25 
trains that would be parked inside train alert shelters in garrisons 
at air force bases around the country in the event of a threat the 
trains each carrying two missiles would move onto the nations 
railroad tracks 
the air force estimates that acquisition cost for the rail 
garrison system is about 74 billion 
congress approved 440 million for research and development of 
the rail garrison program in fiscal 1987 and 1988 and appropriated 
600 million in fiscal 1989 however the pentagon can only spend 
250 million on the mx rail garrison before feb 15 according to 
the department of defense authorization bill for fiscal 1989 
the feb 15 date is the deadline for the president to decide what 
to do with the remainder of the funds 
under the system the trains will be deployed initially at fe 
warren air force base in wyoming and at up to 10 other possible air 
force installations

as a prologue to the broader governmental 
change to occur on friday george bushs team took power wednesday 
at the republican national committee with the election of tough 
infighter lee atwater as party chairman 
he will be my political eyes and ears said the 
presidentelect during a brief appearance at a republican luncheon 
shortly after atwaters election 
with ties to bush that go back to 1973 when the presidentelect 
was party chairman atwater appeared certain to shift political 
influence from the white house staff to the party headquarters 
across town 
during ronald reagans presidency political decisions were made 
by such white house aides as lyn nofziger and ed rollins 
after his unanimous election to the chairmanship atwater told 
the rnc that republican must begin reaching into communities where 
the republican message has not yet found a home 
face it we have been fighting with one arm tied behind our 
back because the democrats have succeeded in virtually cornering 
the votes of whole segments of american society 
atwater said blacks hispanics asians and disabled americans 
have not historically been part of our coalition and added we 
must invite these americans into our partys councils 
bush endorsed the idea saying i like the concept that our 
party needs to have a broader base a stronger participation 
atwater and bush made their appeals to a 165member body that 
according to a rnc aide has only two black members both from the 
virgin islands 
vice presidentelect dan quayle referred to atwaters reputation 
as a tough political gutfighter and joking said the new chairman 
was tough tenacious a real fighter hell fit right in making 
this party kinder and gentler 
also speaking briefly was former new hampshire gov john sununu 
bushs choice for white house chief of staff 
sununu said i come to this job from outside the washington 
beltway there are some who consider that an impediment i 
accept their judgment in that respect i will do my best to learn 
what i have to do as chief of staff 
but he went on to say that his experience outside the beltway 
gave him a better sense of the critical nature of the political 
structures back home 
atwaters predecessor frank j fahrenkopf jr held the 
chairmanship for six years the longest tenure this century 
his parting message emphasized the need for republicans to 
control the process by which legislative district lines will be 
redrawn on the state and federal level to conform with population 
shifts determined in the 1990 census 
in 1981 republicans sought to control redistricting with a heavy 
investment in computers but democrats controlled more governorships 
and state legislatures and they won the day 
the same situation threatens to occur in 1991 unless republican 
overcome the current democratic edge in state politics 
fahrenkopf pointed out that 98 percent house incumbents running 
for reelection in 1988 were victorious a return rate he said was 
higher than that for members of the supreme soviet 
but the part of fahrenkopfs speech that drew the most attention 
from committee members was his outline of the arrangements to 
getting members to various events connected with the bush 
inauguration 
i remind you he told them there is no food at inaugural 
balls this is not a dinner folks

eastbloc foreign ministers at a forum on 
human rights wednesday defended the berlin wall czechoslovakias 
crackdown on dissent and romanias suggestion it may not abide by 
the 35nation accord 
polish and hungarian officials promised greater freedom in their 
nations but envoys of other countries in the sovietled warsaw pact 
stuck to positions that long have divided east and west 
the human rights agreement calls for greater freedom of religion 
travel and emigration for eastbloc citizens it also mandates new 
arms control talks beginning march 9 between nato and the warsaw 
pact to reduce the number of troops and tanks in europe 
foreign ministers of the nations involved in the accord are in 
vienna for the concluding session of the conference which began in 
1986 
soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze brushed off 
suggestions that the berlin wall be torn down as a gesture of 
socialist commitment to the freer movement called for in the accord 
he said the wall was not a subject for the vienna conference on 
security and cooperation in europe 
foreign minister jaromir johanes of czechoslovakia in a speech 
rebutted western denunciations of the way authorities in prague have 
put down recent demonstrations 
anyone in this hall who wants to point the finger at other 
nations including czechoslovakia should first of all look at 
himself johanes said 
he later mentioned the racial unrest in miami as the kind of 
problem troubling other nations 
on tuesday riot police in prague broke up crowds for the third 
straight day and chased hundreds of youths with water cannons and 
truncheons 
authorities used tear gas batons dogs and water cannons to 
disperse 5000 demonstrators who gathered sunday to remember jan 
palach a czech student who burned himself to death in january 1969 
to protest the sovietled invasion of his homeland five months 
earlier 
what is happening in prague is not a violation of human 
rights johanes said in an interview with austrian radio 
human rights activists in the east german city of leipzig also 
were arrested over the weekend after they tried to stage a protest 
us secretary of state george shultz and british foreign 
secretary geoffrey howe on tuesday denounced the crackdowns 
in a speech wednesday west german foreign minister hansdietrich 
genscher said that what had occurred in the last few days against 
peaceful demonstrators in prague and leipzig cannot be allowed to be 
repeated 
foreign ministers peter varkonyi of hungary and tadeusz 
olechowski of poland said their governments will work to ensure the 
provisions of the accord are carried out 
we shall review the existing legislation to see whether it is 
consistent with these new recommendations and where it is not to 
introduce the necessary amendments olechowski said we shall 
expect similar moves by other states 
romania however has drawn criticism from western nations for 
suggesting that it did not necessarily feel bound by the accord 
some of the provisions in the final document which have been 
introduced in the name of concern for free movement or personal 
religious freedoms depart from the realities and needs of our 
times said foreign minister ioan totu 
shevardnadze praised the accord as a sign of a qualitatively 
new situation in europe but repeated the socialist blocs 
position that the berlin wall and other borders are matters of 
national sovereignty 
each state has the right to build its frontiers as it wishes 
and we must proceed from there he said

diplomats said wednesday they see little 
hope of breaking a deadlock in iraniraq peace talks when a un 
envoy visits the region next week but they were optimistic the 
exchange of war prisoners will resume 
secretarygeneral javier perez de cuellar is sending his 
representative swedish un ambassador jan k eliasson to baghdad 
and tehran in an effort to prod iraq and iran into showing some 
flexibility 
their nearly eightyear war ground to a halt aug 20 after both 
sides accepted a ceasefire but peace talks that opened five days 
later immediately stalemated 
the ceasefire resolution calls on both countries to halt all 
military activities withdraw their troops to the border exchange 
about 100000 war prisoners and begin peace talks 
iraq still occupies 259 square miles of iranian territory and 
says it will not withdraw until iran gives up the right to search 
ships for war cargo bound for iraq it considers that a military 
activity 
iran which has not stopped any iraqibound ships since the 
ceasefire began says the withdrawal to the border must be the next 
step in the peace process 
un officials and diplomats speaking on condition of anonymity 
did not foresee the likelihood of tehran or baghdad budging from 
those positions but said progress was possible on the exchange of 
sick or injured pows and other technical measures 
iran and iraq recently allowed the united nations to begin direct 
flights between the two nations a un official said 
previously the two nations distrusted each other so intensely 
that even un diplomats had to fly to a third country to travel 
between them 
the united nations has also received expressions of interest 
from both sides in resuming the exchange of pows the un official 
said 
last year the international committee of the red cross worked 
out a plan for the registration of all pows and the exchange of sick 
or injured pows but the arrangement broke down after only a few 
dozen had been exchanged 
a un official said iran and iraq appear ready to initiate 
direct contacts between their military officers to work out their 
frequent complaints about technical violations of the ceasefire and 
other military matters 
we hope to achieve movement some sense of progress he said 
speaking on condition of anonymity 
he also hoped for progress on substantial issues including the 
impasse over the shattalarab waterway forming the border between 
iran and iraq but noted these are matters of deeper pride 
iraq and iran shared use of the shattalarab under a 1975 
treaty it is iraqs only deepwater access to the persian gulf 
iraq has repudiated the treaty and said another accord should be 
worked out under which the two nations would share use of the 
waterway 
it suggested the united nations oversee the dredging of the 
shattalarab but iran has refused to go along with that unless 
iraq recognizes the 1975 treaty

a brother of one of three voting 
rights workers killed in mississippi in 1964 is unhappy with the 
reenactment of the slayings in the film mississippi burning 
the movie is terribly dishonest and very racist said stephen 
schwerner whose brother michael was one of the victims it 
terribly distorts the realities of 1964 
the executive director of the national association for the 
advancement of colored people agreed mississippi burning 
rewrites history and reeks with dishonesty deception and fraud 
benjamin hooks said in a statement issued wednesday from naacp 
headquarters in baltimore 
blacks in the film are portrayed as cowed submissive and 
blankfaced they are used as a backdrop when in reality they were 
the principals this is a gross libel on the many black 
mississippians who even knowing they could be murdered with 
impunity and nothing would ever be done still sought time and time 
again the right to vote hooks said 
schwerner 51 dean of students at antioch college in this 
southwest ohio community said tuesday he is less concerned about 
the historical accuracy of the movie than he is about its depictions 
of blacks and federal officials 
he said the movie portrays blacks as passive spectators in the 
civil rights movement in the south and the fbi as a champion of 
civil rights 
in general the fbi was an enemy of the civil rights 
movement said schwerner who was a member of the congress of 
racial equality and active in civil rights demonstrations in new 
york city and during his college days in yellow springs 
they had to be dragged into the case kicking and screaming by 
lyndon johnson and only then because two of the victims were 
white schwerner said 
hooks said it was unconscionable to depict the fbi as the good 
guys 
under j edgar hoover who despised blacks and despised most 
expecially dr martin luther king the fbi was not a friend of 
blacks but an enemy who spied on the movement and was not above 
using its own bag of dirty tricks 
michael schwerner andrew goodman and james chaney disappeared in 
neshoba county miss after they were arrested and jailed briefly 
for speeding on june 21 1964 while they were trying to gather 
information on a church bombing their bodies were found buried in 
an earthen dam about two months later 
seven people including a deputy sheriff were convicted of 
conspiracy charges in connection with the slayings 
the movies director alan parker has emphasized that 
mississippi burning is fiction but schwerner said so many 
details of the film are factual even down to the ku klux klan 
nickname for his brother goatee that the distinction between 
fact and fiction is intentionally blurred and that makes the larger 
distortions that much more disturbing he said 
there are black kids and white kids who are going to see that 
movie and will walk out believing that the fbi was the moving force 
behind the civil rights movement and behind the destruction of the 
kkk and thats just grossly dishonest schwerner said its 
like reading in some history books that all blacks were perfectly 
happy on slave plantations 
the fbi secretly tapped schwerners parents phone following his 
brothers disappearance at the age of 24 he said 
through the freedom of information act schwerner recently 
obtained a copy of a letter from hoover to attorney general robert 
kennedy requesting the wiretap schwerner said hoover suspected the 
disappearances may have been a hoax and publicity stunt he said

the government on wednesday again 
changed its position on when it knew about a suspected chemical 
weapons plant in libya and opposition lawmakers shouted their 
disapproval in parliament 
the latest switch came amid accusations by the opposition that 
the government tried to cover up alleged involvement by west german 
companies in the libyan project 
wolfgang schaeuble chancellor helmut kohls chief of staff 
delivered a long address in parliament defending the governments 
actions 
schaeuble said the us embassy in bonn informed west german 
officials may 18 about possible german involvement in the libyan 
plant 
the united states alleges the plant was intended to produce 
chemical weapons libya says it will produce pharmaceuticals 
the may 15 date is five months earlier than what the government 
acknowledged monday and six months earlier than the nov 15 date 
west german leaders mentioned three weeks ago 
opposition lawmakers shouted and hooted during the speech 
when the scandal first broke three weeks ago west german leaders 
angrily denied us allegations german firms were involved in the 
plant they also denied having any knowledge the complex may be 
intended for production of chemical weapons 
norbert gansel a lawmaker with the opposition social democrats 
spoke after schaeuble and criticized the governments handling of 
the growing scandal which has led to criminal investigations into 
two west german companies 
the question is what you knew and what you did about it 
gansel said 
he added you herr chancellor are politically and personally 
responsible that the german and international public were deceived 
for a long time 
officials have said the government did not immediately say what 
it knew because that would have jeopardized west german 
investigations 
schaeuble told lawmakers that in august 1987 the west german 
federal intelligence service received information the plant in all 
probability was intended for producing chemical weapons 
he said at the time there was no evidence of west german 
involvement in the plant 
schaeuble also said that on the basis of intelligence reports 
we must assume that this plant in rabta is intended to produce 
chemical weapons 
on tuesday chief government spokesman friedhelm ost refused to 
say whether bonn had evidence backing the us charges about the 
plant 
according to schaeuble new reports by the west german 
intelligence service gave clear indications of involvement by 
german companies in the libyan factory 
kohl received his first comprehensive report on the 
suspicions oct 20 schaeuble said 
schaeuble also provided new information about west german 
investigations into the affair 
he said that on dec 14 west german investigators met with an 
informant who gave them documents indicating involvement by the 
german firm imhausenchemie in the libyan plant 
according to schaeuble the informant said other documents could 
be obtained from ibi engineering a nowdefunct company that was 
based in frankfurt 
criminal investigations have been launched against imhausen and 
ibi which allegedly organized participation by german firms in 
the libyan plant 
the criminal investigations began as a result of a jan 4 seizure 
of ibi documents schaeuble said 
he rejected any suggestion west german authorities had tried to 
cover up the affair 
kohl was present during the debate but did not speak according 
to a government spokesman schaeuble delivered the speech because it 
was a matter of protocol

george bushs penchant for spontanaiety is 
raising speculation about whether he might just decide to hop out of 
his armored limousine friday for a bit of inaugural parade 
handshaking 
while there is no word from the bush camp on whether he might 
decide to work the sidewalk crowds the secret service is fully 
prepared with protection for whatever fancy might strike him said 
spokesman special agent rich adams 
we would be derelict in our duty if we werent prepared for 
that he said the possibility always exists hes the 
president and were there to provide security 
however adams said he has no information on whether bush will 
decide to get out of the brand new 1989 ford lincoln town car 
bush wouldnt be the first president to walk in his own parade 
jimmy carter got out of his limousine in 1977 and walked hand in 
hand with his wife rosalynn for much of the distance down 
pennsylvania avenue 
president reagan did not follow suit in 1981 remaining inside 
his car 
bushs black limousine which is being used for the first time 
has a bit less window area than reagans did so that people will 
have less chance of glimpsing him inside 
both before and since his nov 8 election bush has set a style 
that is much more spontaneous than reagans he likes to dine 
spurofthemoment at local restaurants and has turned up a local 
clothing or specialty shops 
during the campaign bush would occasionally stop his motorcade to 
chat with farmers in their fields or schoolchildren by the road 
on one occasion a rural restaurant got word that he might stop 
for a meal and the proprietors became irate when he instead walked 
into a momandpop store next door and bought a couple slices of 
pizza to go

a trailblazing soviet magazine and its 
editorinchief came under fire from the two most prominent 
newspapers wednesday with one printing a letter that denounced the 
weekly as scum bent on defaming soviet history 
under president mikhail s gorbachev the magazine ogonyok and 
its chief vitaly korotich have become widely known and 
increasingly controversial many of the sensational revelations made 
by soviet media under gorbachevs policy of glasnost or greater 
openness have appeared in ogonyok 
in this weeks issue the slick magazine with more 3 million 
subscribers nationwide revealed soviet suicide statistics for recent 
years denounced pollution and ran the latest episode of an expose 
on corruption and cronyism under the late leader leonid i brezhnev 
seven prominent cultural figures in a letter to the communist 
party daily newspaper pravda bitterly attacked ogonyok saying it 
had gone far outside the bounds of literary arguments 
the magazine has taken upon itself the role of a kind of judge 
on all questions of social life politics the economy culture and 
morals they wrote 
the seven grouped ogonyok along with soviet publications they 
said are engaged in an unprecedented distortion of history and 
that revise the social achievements of the people 
they accused it of printing unverified hearsay and of deprecating 
soviet cultural icons such as poet vladimir mayakovsky and nobel 
literature laureate mikhail sholokhov author of and quiet flows 
the don 
those signing the letter including conservative writers valentin 
rasputin and vasily belov said they supported with all their 
souls the reform program undertaken by gorbachev but had become 
alarmed by scum bubbling up on the crest of the mighty stream of 
renovation 
ogonyok has drawn tough and insulting criticism from other soviet 
media before but pravda gave great prominence to the letter 
printing it above the fold on its back page that placement in the 
partys top daily could indicate highlevel irritation at ogonyok 
and its view of the soviet past and present 
since the magazine has been one of the leaders in the drive for 
franker discussion of social problems and a more honest 
comingtogrips with the countrys past any official attack on it 
would be perceived by many soviets as a signal of glasnosts limits 
izvestia the governments afternoon newspaper ran its own 
correspondents article that cast doubt on ogonyoks credibility and 
wondered aloud why korotich was trying to run in a moscow 
neighborhood for a seat in a new national assembly the council of 
peoples deputies to be elected in march 
the ogonyok editor was seen by millions of us television 
viewers when cbs news anchorman dan rather visited with him in a 
segment of the networks 1987 documentary on soviet life seven 
days in may under glasnost the magazine has been transformed 
from a staid journal to a lively and popular magazine 
izvestia correspondent a stepovoi said he attended a jan 9 
meeting of voters from moscows 21st electoral district called to 
nominate korotich to the new council ogonyok this week ran a story 
on the same meeting and said it was broken up by vocal rightwing 
russian nationalists extremists before the necessary quorum of 500 
voters could assemble 
stepovoi however said not only members of the group known as 
pamyat or memory had caused the disorders implying 
korotich supporters also were involved he said the shouting march 
began after organizers of the meeting announced they had failed to 
assemble a quorum and that korotich would hold a creative 
meeting instead 
stepovoi also questioned why korotich would want to run for the 
new assembly from a moscow district since some soviet social 
organizations that are entitled to direct representation in the 
assembly have already named korotich as a candidate 
whats the point stepovoi asked as ogonyok has reported 
korotich was nominated as a candidate for peoples deputy of the 
ussr he added i can personally note that hes been chosen 
by the magazines collective

the supreme court in a case that could affect 
onthejob racial bias lawsuits nationwide was urged wednesday to 
throw out discrimination charges against alaska salmon canneries 
both sides in the case acknowledged that the industry a 
seasonal business that relies on migrant workers drawn from remote 
areas is hardly typical of us commerce 
but the case could provide standards for handling job 
discrimination claims throughout the nation 
douglas m fryer a lawyer for two companies based in washington 
state and oregon said employers in the case have done more than 
their fair share of hiring minorities at canneries they operate in 
alaska 
the companies should not be penalized under misplaced legal 
theories adopted by a lower court fryer said 
but abraham a arditi representing filipinos alaska natives and 
asians said the companies relegated the minority workers to the 
lowestpaying jobs in a pervasive discriminatory system 
he said the minority workers were capable of doing the 
betterpaying jobs theres no question about the availability of 
skilled personnel among the minority groups arditi said 
the courts ruling expected by july could clear up questions 
left unanswered by a ruling last june that said employees can use 
statistical evidence to prove that some subjective decisions made by 
their employers violate federal law the court reinstated a suit by 
a black woman who charged a texas bank with discrimination 
but that ruling failed to produce a majority of five votes for 
any particular legal theory and some observers believe it could 
prove at best a mixed blessing for minority groups 
in the alaska case nonwhites charged discrimination by wards 
cove packing co inc of seattle and castle amp cooke inc of astoria 
ore 
the companies operate salmon canneries in remote areas of alaska 
during the summer salmon run 
nonwhites say that while they hold nearly half the jobs at the 
canneries the jobs are racially stratified with whites dominating 
in the higherpaying positions such as machinists carpenters and 
administrators 
the companies said any racial divisions are for legitimate 
businessrelated reasons for example they said most higherpaying 
jobs require skill and prior experience that nonwhites have 
difficulty acquiring because they are seasonal workers from remote 
regions of alaska 
arditi challenging that claim wednesday said nepotism is 
pervasive in the canneries with whites hiring inexperienced youthful 
relatives for higherpaying jobs 
you have 14yearolds 15yearolds 16yearolds who are hired 
for upperlevel jobs arditi said 
justice antonin scalia questioned whether that is proof of racial 
bias he offered the example of a familyowned business that hires 
family members 
one of the key issues in the case is the use of statistics to 
demonstrate bias or the lack of it 
fryer argued that statistics showing nonwhites holding most of 
the lowerpaying seasonal cannery worker jobs and fewer better 
positions do not prove discrimination 
the relevant figures are those showing that the companies hire 
for the higherranking positions from a pacific northwest labor 
market that is only 10 percent nonwhite he said the companies say 
they filled those more desirable jobs with more than 20 percent 
nonwhites 
a federal judge ruled in favor of the companies in 1983 throwing 
out the suit but the 9th us circuit court of appeals reinstated 
the suit in 1987 and ordered a full trial 
the companies appealed to the supreme court to overrule the 
appeals court 
the reagan administration is siding with the cannery owners the 
justice department said the 9th circuit court placed too heavy a 
burden on the companies to disprove the bias claims 
the case is wards cove vs atonio 871387

partial withdrawal of 50000 troops from hungary czechoslovakia and 
east germany announced by gorbachev in his un speech will take 
place in two phases

1990 austrian television reported shabonov as saying in an

the federal trade commission has filed consumer 
fraud charges against a virginia physician who told patients his 
treatments would increase their chances of becoming pregnant the 
ftc said wednesday 
the complaint alleges that dr cecil jacobson director of the 
reproductive genetic center of vienna va told his patients his 
hormoneinjection treatments had resulted in fullterm successful 
pregnancies for more than 80 percent of his patients 
in fact no more than 40 percent of those who received repeated 
injections of human chorionic gonadotropin or hcg became pregnant 
according to ftc chairman daniel oliver 
while hcg slightly enhances the odds of a woman becoming 
pregnant the hormone is more commonly found simply as a chemical 
biproduct of pregnancy usually showing up in urine tests according 
to the ftc 
in all jacobson treated several hundred women who lost from 
400000 to more than 2 million oliver said 
the ftc will be seeking a return of some or all fees collected 
from each patient jacobson treated oliver said 
in addition the ftc has also asked the us district court for 
eastern virginia to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting 
jacobson from making further such claims 
several of jacobsons patients have also filed civil suits 
against him they are seeking recovery of fees some also want 
unspecified damages 
while the treatments caused no physical harm a 38yearold 
patient of jacobsons was told by another physician that she had 
greatly diminished her chances of becoming pregnant because the 
several years she spent using jacobsons program had taken her 
closer to the end of her fertility cycle an ftc official said 
jacobson was not immediately available to comment his license to 
practice medicine has not been suspended oliver said

defense minister yitzhak rabin walked out of a 
stormy parliament debate wednesday after opposition members heckled 
him about increased bloodshed in the occupied territories and 
demanded he resign 
eight small parties tried to bring down the government with a 
series of noconfidence motions but legislators of the broad 
national unity government voted them down 
the opposition reflected growing unease many israelis feel about 
the armys handling of the palestinian uprising in the occupied west 
bank and gaza strip there also is frustration because the army has 
not been able to squelch the 13month revolt which does not appear 
to be flagging 
the cabinet met privately for a briefing on tougher army policies 
that include destroying the houses of suspected stonethrowers and 
liberalizing shooting regulations 
at the united nations in new york deputy plo observer riyad h 
mansour said the israelis were committing a small massacre in an 
attempt to crush the uprising during the transition between us 
administrations 
rabin who stopped his speech at least a dozen times because of 
raucous shouting left the podium after about half an hour and 
refused to complete his statement 
i propose the government reject these noconfidence motions 
he said quietly before leaving the hall 
the debate was over the high number of palestinian deaths in 
recent weeks 
thirteen palestinians have been killed in the past week and 
critics have blamed many of the casualties on the armys increasing 
use of plastic bullets and newly introduced rubbercoated metal 
pellets 
four palestinians were reported wounded in stonethrowing clashes 
with israeli troops in the west bank on wednesday the army 
confirmed the injures two in hebron and two near nablus 
the army spokesmans office said it was checking reports that on 
tuesday and wednesday an army lieutenant fired at rooftop water 
tanks in the west bank town of tulkarem arab reporters said five 
tanks were punctured 
rabin said that as long as palestinians stage violent protests 
the tougher army policies will stand 
as long as they say we will continue with violence their 
violence will be met with force he said what is israel to do 
talk peace shouted one arab member of parliament 
get out of the territories shouted another 
this is a government with a plastic heart a brain of lead and 
a conscience of rubber said mohammad miari of the progressive 
list for peace 
rabin said residents of the occupied territories refused to 
abandon support for the palestine liberation organization and 
instead talk peace directly with israel 
israel refuses to talk with the plo which it considers a 
terrorist organization 
what does all that have to do with killing children with the 
daily slaughter in the territories shouted tewfik toubi an arab 
member of the israel communist party 
since the uprising began in december 1987 362 palestinians have 
been killed and 15 jews have died 
two rightwing parties filed noconfidence motions but they 
charged that rabin was too soft on palestinians during the 
intefadeh which is arabic for uprising 
we have failed to deal with the intefadeh said rehavam 
zeevi of the rightwing homeland party youths and children are 
going wild in the streets and villages while we sit embarrassed and 
confused 
his party advocates mass deportations of arabs 
yossi sarid of the liberal citizens rights movement charged that 
the governments policy is not just killing palestinians it is 
killing the souls of israeli soldiers 
he was referring to complaints that angry soldiers lodged tuesday 
with prime minister yitzhak shamir when he visited a tent camp in 
nablus they said they were foced to beat innocent people and felt 
they were betraying their values

the state department said wednesday it has 
obtained a tape recording of yasser arafat the palestine liberation 
organization chairman threatening to pump 10 bullets in the 
chest of anyone trying to stifle the palestinian uprising on the 
israeliheld west bank and in gaza 
the department noted that arafat has since denied the threat and 
there was no indication the united states was reconsidering its 
decision to talk with the plo 
but officials said the united states has made clear to arafat 
that it considers the comment inconsistent with his commitment to 
renounce terrorism 
and us sources speaking on condition of anonymity said that 
president reagan told egyptian president hosni mubarak in a letter 
of his concern over the remarks reagan said egypt and the united 
states must make sure arafat does not deviate from his pledge to 
refrain from terrorism and to recognize israels right to exist 
said the sources 
state department spokesman charles redman said the department had 
received a tape recording of comments arafat made last week in which 
he said whoever thinks of stopping the intifada before it 
achieves its goals i will give him 10 bullets in the chest 
intifada is the arabic word for the 13month uprising by 
palestinians against israels occupation of the west bank and gaza 
strip 
the reported threat was believed to be directed at elias freij 
the mayor of the west bank town of bethlehem who is considered a 
moderate palestinian and who called for a truce in the uprising 
arafat has denied threatening him but redman said that is 
clearly a threat weve made it clear that this threat is 
inconsistent with arafats december 14 renunciation of terrorism and 
with the usplo dialogue 
that dialogue began last december after the organization 
accepted american conditions that it recognization of israels right 
to exist and renounce use of terrorism since then us ambassador 
robert pelletreau has met in tunis with several plo officials 
last year secretary of state george p shultz accusing the plo 
of terrorism and arafat of being an accessory barred the issuance 
of a visa to the plo chief to address the united nations general 
assembly in new york shultz subsequently recommended the us 
dialogue with the plo while maintaining a public campaign against 
terrorism 
the renewed possibility of an arafat visit to the united states 
arose after the plo chief said he would be willing to address the 
annual convention of the americanarab antidiscrimination committee 
in washington in april 
but arafat told a group of arab americans who met with him in 
tunis last week that he could only come to washington if they could 
arrange a visa for him said one participant khalil jahshan 
redman said if arafat applied for a visa to address a group in 
the united states we would look at it very carefully he said 
such an application at the moment was hypothetical 
secretary of statedesignate james baker was noncommittal on the 
visa question wednesday at his senate confirmation hearing he said 
he was not in a position to prejudge what we would do if arafat 
applies for a visa 
baker also said there is a difference between asking for a visa 
to address the un and asking for a visa in conjunction with a 
speaking engagement in washington he did not elaborate saying he 
did not want to be seen as tilting the issue one way or another

i cant help thinking that somewhere a long way off theres a

the team to victory it has become a political slogan reagan has 
repeated many times

sweater had been awarded to gipp for his performance as a halfback 
on the notre dame team in 1917 and 1918

football from the teams 3421 fiesta bowl victory over the

prosecutors on wednesday announced 
criminal probes of a key company in the libyan chemical weapons 
plant dispute and a bavarian company that reportedly delivered 
sophisticated equipment to libyas air force 
the new probes bring to three the number of criminal 
investigations in the widening scandal and in each case authorities 
acknowledged they were checking allegations made by west german news 
reports 
since the first allegations of west german involvement were 
published early this month the nations news media have been 
particularly aggressive about pursuing the story 
politicians meanwhile have had to retract their earlier denials 
of west german involvement with the plant in rabta 60 miles south 
of the libyan capital of tripoli washington says it was built to 
make chemical arms while the libyan government of col moammar 
gadhafi says it will make pharmaceuticals 
in bonn on wednesday chancellor helmut kohl sat with other 
lawmakers as his chief aide wolfgang schaeuble addressed an 
acrimonious session of parliament about when the government in bonn 
first learned of the charges 
schaeuble said the us government in may passed on tips about 
west german involvement in the suspected libyan chemical weapons 
plant he said the tips also involved the alleged german help in 
providing gadhafis air force with midair refueling capability 
the frankfurt prosecutors office said wednesday it has opened a 
criminal investigation of the nowdefunct ibi engineering 
company which us officials have accused of providing equipment 
for the plant 
our authorities opened the probe against ibi on friday 
because of suspicion of reported violations of export laws 
frankfurt prosecutor jochen schroers told the associated press in a 
telephone interview 
he declined to provide further information about ibi which 
allegedly provided the contracts to the west german companies to 
build the plant 
west germanys ard television network reported that about 50 
companies just in the greater frankfurt area are suspected of having 
taken part federal customs officials are also investigating 
in munich chief prosecutor heinz stocker said he was looking 
into a report in this weeks der spiegel magazine that says the 
intec technical trade and logistik company has been helping libya 
develop the ability to refuel its warplanes while in flight 
the prosecutor said he had already planned to investigate intec 
but added authorities want to know whether the report in spiegel is 
correct 
that is a point of the investigation stocker told the ap in 
a telephone interview late wednesday afternoon we will have to 
see what comes out 
the probe against intec concerns fuel tank equipment sent to 
libya and may also involve violations of west germanys export 
laws he said we dont know what was done with this equipment in 
libya 
der spiegel reported 10 intechired engineers are playing a key 
role in helping libya fit warplanes and transport planes with 
equipment necessary for midair refueling to extend the warplanes 
range 
intec is in the town of vaterstetten near munich 
last week offenburg prosecutor werner botz announced he was 
investigating the imhausenchemie company which reportedly also had 
a major role in the construction of the suspected chemical weapons 
plant 
offenburg is near the black forest town of lahr where imhausen 
has its headquarters

the longwhispered dark secret of a 
19thcentury woman who was ostracized by this small town after she 
reputedly violated one of societys strictest sexual taboos was 
openly the talk of the town wednesday 
everybodys been buzzing about this librarian suzanne rich 
said the day after an documentary about the woman who unknowingly 
married her own son was broadcast nationally on public television 
at the town office deputy clerk audrey bamford said most 
everyone she spoke to had taped the show on their videocassette 
recorder i guess its the most taped show in the town of 
fayette she said 
the story of emeline bacheldor born in 1816 has surfaced twice 
in the past decade the first was emmeline a fictionalized 
account with an altered spelling by bestselling author judith 
rossner 
then on tuesday the facts came fully out in the open when a 
nonfiction account sins of our mothers was shown as the final 
installment of public broadcasting services the american 
experience series 
most residents of t6his western maine town reacted favorably to 
the documentary expressing shock and sadness at the way emeline was 
shunned by the town and forced to live out her final years in 
isolation and poverty in a tiny shack 
they also noted how dramatically societys attitudes have changed 
back then everybody was very puritanical and if anyone did 
anything that was against the rules of the church they avoided them 
like the plague but people today are a lot more forgiving said 
mrs bamford who helped research the program 
the program based on interviews and town records told how 
emeline was sent to work in a massachusetts cotton mill and became 
pregnant at the age of 14 
the baby was given up for adoption and emeline returned to 
fayette where she married her husband later ran away and she fell 
in love with a much younger man leonard gurney whom she married 
when she was 62 
but when gurneys relatives came to meet his bride they realized 
he was the son she had given up the marriage was annulled gurney 
left town and emeline was treated as an outcast 
criticism of the film focused on its accuracy and the motivation 
of those behind the project 
arnold sturtevant a banker and deacon of the fayette baptist 
church called the documentary a valuable and sensitive portrayal 
of the human condition a true tragedy 
but he added how much can be a true loving concern for the 
povertystricken and socially oppressed such as emeline and how 
much of it might be more properly characterized as selfish catering 
to mans taste for prurient sensationalism 
library volunteer laura merrill complained that the film 
portrayed the town in a negative light 
producer david hoffman first learned of emeline while 
interviewing nettie mitchell an elderly woman known as a 
storyteller in 1974 for an unrelated bicenntennial project 
mrs mitchell who died in 1981 two days before her 95th 
birthday was believed to have been the last person to set eyes upon 
emeline who died in 1898 she recalled being sent by her father to 
take food to the outcast woman who otherwise would have starved to 
death 
i was absolutely flabbergasted recalled hoffman he took the 
story to rossner the novelist bestknown for looking for mr 
goodbar rossners 1980 book emmeline was based on what she 
heard from mrs mitchell but made little claim to historic accuracy 
before rossners book according to most accounts emelines 
story was a town secret known by longtime residents 
it was talked about but always whispered dirty rumors and 
that sort of thing said matthew collins director of the 
documentary 
town manager mike dearmott a longtime resident said emelines 
story was one of those things that was kind of hidden away back in 
the corner 
everyone embellished it a little bit he said and they would 
luxuriate in our little secret

newly arrived nicaraguans expressed gratitude 
wednesday at the warm reception theyve received and puzzlement at 
black resentment that some say has fueled rioting 
the support of our cuban brothers has been very generous the 
solidarity with them has been great said carlos quintero 43 one 
of about 2000 central americans who have immigrated to the miami 
area the past two months 
the influx swelled to about 100000 people the nicaraguan exile 
community centered in a county that already was onethird cuban 
some black community leaders have cited resentment over the 
welcome given the nicaraguans and fears the new immigrants will 
crowd blacks out of jobs as fueling ethnic tensions in miami the 
rioting that broke out this week began after the fatal shooting of a 
young black man by a hispanic police officer 
the riots are terrible a disaster said quintero who with 
his wife and three children have been taken in by nicaraguan friends 
in sweetwater the nearby city dubbed little managua i dont 
understand it i heard it might have something to do with us i 
heard the blacks dont like us too much 
this doesnt have anything to do with us we didnt come here 
to cause problems we came here to work and to live in freedom 
said julio aquilar a youth looking over a spanishlanguage 
newspaper report on the rioting 
he was outside bobby maduro stadium a makeshift city shelter for 
about 200 nicaraguans and about 180 other miami homeless people 
the city is renovating a replacement shelter so the stadium can 
be vacated by next week and readied for its spring tenants the 
baltimore orioles baseball team meanwhile the roman catholic 
archdiocese put up 150 immigrants at its family activities center on 
sunday 
gerard jeanjuste a catholic priest and other haitian community 
leaders and some american black leaders said haitians who are 
black dont receive such help they said the united states has a 
racist immigration policy of intercepting haitians at sea and 
sending them back home while allowing white hispanics to enter from 
central america and apply for political asylum 
cubanborn mayor xavier suarez has blamed the rioting on bad 
police relations with the black community and other longterm 
problems but he also said wednesday it was time for us 
immigration policy to remove distinctions that give the appearance 
of discrimination 
the nicaraguan arrivals hit a peak of 200 a day after a federal 
judge in texas ruled two weeks ago that us immigration authorities 
couldnt force them to stay near the border while their political 
asylum requests were being considered 
virginia kice immigration and naturalization service spokeswoman 
in harlingen texas said that since jan 9 authorities had 
received 2733 political asylum applications from central americans 
of those 44 percent were nicaraguans she said 
thirtyfour percent of the central americans indicated they 
were traveling on to miami which is fewer than we expected from our 
previous experience ms kice said she said it was too early to 
speculate on why the numbers were lower than the 50 percent 
predicted new york and los angeles at 13 percent each were the 
nextfavorite destinations she said 
many of the nicaraguans are without work permits which are 
handed out slowly by ins after casebycase review but in addition 
to city aid spanishlanguage radio and television drives have 
raised about 70000 and private donors have kept them supplied 
with clothing and food 
a lot of them have gained weight here some of them got sick 
because they ate too much said pablo canton assistant city 
director of community development 
most of the cubans can identify with this group thats why 
theyve been so generous said canton who came with his family 
from cuba 27 years ago at age 16 theyre going through the same 
thing we went through leaving their homeland because of 
communists 
he rejected criticisms from some black leaders that the city has 
gone out of its way to accommodate nicaraguans while doing little 
for its other poor and homeless 
we have a big heart for everybody canton said these 
people need help and the federal government isnt doing anything 
were just trying to help them get started to give them a positive 
attitude that this is the land of dreams if you work for it

the energy department on wednesday officially 
crowned texas the winner of a sevenstate battle to host a proposed 
59 billion superconducting super collider 
at a formal ceremony attended by texas gov bill clements john 
herrington the energy secretary signed an official record of 
decision to build the massive physics installation around the city 
of waxahachie about 25 miles south of dallas 
the collider is envisioned as a 53mile underground ring that 
would use 10000 magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other 
at energy levels 20 times what is possible in todays most powerful 
machines 
scientists will use the facility to explore the nature of matter 
and energy it is to be called the ronald reagan center for 
highenergy physics although it remains uncertain whether congress 
will give the goahead to begin construction 
last year congress agreed to spend 100 million on the collider 
but it decreed that none of the money be spent on construction in 
his budget proposal for the coming fiscal year president reagan 
requested 250 million for the collider including 90 million for 
research and development and 160 million for construction 
herrington had declared last nov 10 that texas was the 
preferred site for the project but a waiting period was 
required before the choice was made official 
texas has been chosen as the super collider site because it is 
the superior site from an overall standpoint herrington said at 
the signing ceremony 
some of the states that lost in the bidding have questioned the 
energy departments selection process 
democratic sens paul simon of illinois and dennis deconcini of 
arizona are among those who have asked congresss investigative arm 
the general accounting office to review the departments site 
selection process and to determine whether the choice was influenced 
more by politics than by merit 
victor f weisskopf a physicist who attended the signing 
ceremony as part of a separate award presentation said the super 
collider would allow scientists to explore how this great universe 
was started and how it has developed 
we need the superconducting super collider to help all the 
scientists of the planet to penetrate deeper into the mysteries of 
matter he said 
besides arizona and illinois the states which lost the bidding 
race were colorado michigan north carolina and tennessee

a prosecutor on wednesday urged a judge 
to convict 15 britons two belgian police officers and a former 
soccer official on charges stemming from a 1985 stadium riot that 
killed 39 soccer fans 
the sentence should be an example prosecutor pierre erauw 
said during the third and final day of his closing argument 
on trial are 26 britons two belgian state police officers the 
brussels mayor and deputy mayor two european soccer officials and 
albert roosens former secretarygeneral of the belgian soccer 
federation 
erauw said two of the 26 british suspects should be acquitted for 
lack of proof and that he had reservations about eight other 
british cases he also asked that one case be severed from the other 
british cases because the suspect is jailed in britain on an 
unrelated matter 
the judges decision is expected in march if convicted of 
involuntary manslaughter the british suspects face up to 10 years 
in jail although erauw has called for terms of only up to four 
years 
president judge peirre verlynde still can override erauws 
recommendations 
however a defense lawyer said convictions are unlikely against 
the 10 suspects against whom the evidence was questioned by erauw 
he is effectively recommending the complete acquittal for 
those defendants against whom he says guilt has not been established 
to his satisfaction said sir harry livermore of liverpool 
but erauw said two belgian state police officials and roosens 
should be convicted they face up to two years in jail 
on monday he cited inadequate organization of the match by 
roosens who was secretarygeneral of the belgian soccer federation 
at the time of the tragedy 
he also blamed state police officers johan mahieu and michel 
kensier for inadequate security measures and failing to act to stem 
the rioting 
on tuesday he said the brussels mayor his alderman for sports 
matters and two officials of the union of european football 
associations should not be sentenced 
the 26 britons are accused of instigating europes worstever 
soccer riot the violence broke out on may 29 1985 before a game 
between juventus turin of italy and fc liverpool of england the 
final match of the european champions cup at brussels heysel 
stadium 
the britons were charged based on videotapes and photographs 
taken of the rioting which began when british soccer fans charged 
into a neighboring section of the stands filled mostly with italian 
fans about 500 people were hurt and 39 including 34 italians were 
killed during the ensuing stampede 
the british defendants are on trial after their government 
seeking to come to grips with soccer hooliganism agreed to 
extradite them they are expected to be allowed to return home to 
await the end of the trial that began oct 15

children returned to class to confront 
their fears with help from psychologists wednesday just one day 
after a gunman fascinated by toy soldiers killed five youngsters at 
the school he attended as a boy 
blood was washed from the pavement overnight and bullet holes 
were patched at cleveland elementary school where experts said it 
was important that pupils mostly children of southeast asian 
refugees deal with the trauma immediately 
i still feel upset but i have to bring my kid to see the 
teacher to let the teacher know my kids all right brom lee said 
in broken english everybodys angry your kid there you get 
angry too 
his daughter 7yearold nary said she was scared to return 
because i saw blood holding tightly to her fathers hand she 
pointed to her leg and said i saw somebody get shot right here 
police said patrick edward purdy wearing an olivedrab shirt 
bearing the iranian battle cry death to the great satin sic 
on tuesday sprayed more than 100 shots from an assault rifle 
killing five youngsters ages 6 to 9 and wounding 30 other people 
a drifter who police said was either 24 or 26 purdy killed 
himself with a pistol shot to the head after the mute methodical 
attack during recess 
why he did this we may never know said capt dennis perry 
we can only assume that some problem came up in this guy that made 
him do it obviously he had a military hangup 
carved into the stock of purdys rifle was the word hezbollah 
iranian for party of god hezbollah is the name of a shiite moslem 
faction in lebanon also carved into the rifle were the words 
freedom and victory 
perry said the man in the days leading up to the bloodbath 
lived in a motel room where officers found a broken rifle about 100 
toy soldiers scattered about and an olive drab cloth on which were 
drawn three snarlingtype faces 
records indicate that a patrick edward purdy attended cleveland 
elementary through third grade from 1969 to 1973 said district 
spokesman john klose 
as police pieced together his past psychologists met with the 
children as they returned to class today volunteers some speaking 
cambodian or laotian were expected to act as translators 
bouquets were placed atop the school sign on the lawn and five 
red roses were laid at its base across the street a 9foot paper 
sign read racists are ugly lets stop them 
perry said the only contact his department had with purdy before 
tuesday was in 1986 when his mother called to complain that he and 
his half brother had vandalized her car after she refused demands 
for drug money 
purdy had a long police record most of it in the los angeles 
area perry said charges involved prostitution marijuana 
manufacture or sale of an illegal weapon receiving stolen property 
and robbery authorities said 
perry said he served jail time in at least the last two cases 
purdy had parked his station wagon behind the school and set it 
ablaze with a molotov cocktail tuesday morning 
he fired 106110 shots from a bayonetequipped chinesemade 
ak47 assault rifle at hundreds of youngsters enjoying a sunny 
recess reloading at least once 
the semiautomatic rifle purchased in august in sandy ore for 
147 was capable of firing as quickly as purdy could pull the 
trigger police said 
i dont understand why and i probably wont ever know why 
said purdys grandmother 63yearold julia chumbley of lodi its 
like a nightmare this sort of thing happens to others not you 
your own grandson 
purdy who often worked as a welder and used the alias eddie 
purdy west had apparently worked at a stockton machine shop numeri 
tech president dave tankersley said he hired a man he knew as eddie 
west last january to sit there and drill holes he worked there 
for about a month 
he was quiet he always acted like he was sort of mad you tell 
him what to do give him a job he never smiled tankersley 
said in fact i thought he was mad half the time 
a 6yearold boy was in serious condition and 17 pupils and a 
teacher were in stable condition the others were treated at 
hospitals or at the scene and were released 
the 40yearold neighborhood near the university of the pacific 
is home to many retired couples who raised their familes there but 
the culture has been changing with the influx of southeast asian 
refugees 
southeast asian pupils make up about 71 percent of the schools 
enrollment of 986 
about 100000 southeast asians have immigrated to californias 
300mile long central valley because of its farming and fishing 
industries and because of a climate similar to that of their native 
countries

add one more to the list of things that cant 
be kept secret in washington 
when a float that looks like a navy boat rounds the corner of 
15th street and pennsylvania avenue in fridays inaugural parade 
newly swornin president bush is supposed to get one of the 
surprises of his life 
navy men wednesday draped black plastic over the float which is 
topped with a newly painted grumman avenger aircraft like the one 
that bush was shot down in during world war ii 
but the men acknowledged the plane was no longer much of a 
secret there was at least one news story published about it and 
photographers were attracted to the shrouded object outside the 
smithsonian air amp space museum 
the idea according to parade organizers was to surprise bush 
with the aircraft and a dozen men from his old navy torpedo squadron 
the wingspan is so wide bush could almost reach out and touch it 
from his reviewing stand said a navy officer watching over the 
plane 
he said trees along the parade route had to be trimmed to get the 
plane through and a couple of reviewing stands had to be moved back 
to accommodate its 54foot wingspan 
the wings could be folded back birdlike but the officer said 
parade officials wanted to be sure it could make it along the route 
in full flying position 
bush was rescued from the pacific ocean on sept 2 1944 after 
he bailed out of his flaming grumman avenger torpedo bomber over the 
bonin islands 600 miles south of japan he won the distinguished 
flying cross for heroism during the bombing raid his two crew 
members were killed 
the plane in the parade built in the 1940s by general motors on 
a grumman design was flown to washington after it was spotted in a 
field by a world war ii veteran working with the uss yorktown 
association in mt pleasant sc 
veterans from the yorktown arranged for the plane to be in the 
parade and also tracked down members of bushs old torpedo squadron 
air group vt 51 to ride along with it said joseph sharkey 
assistant director of the veterans group 
about 10000 avengers were built according to grumman historian 
lois louisolo with 45 of the antique aircraft still registered to 
fly

the governments of israel and iraq both denied 
reports on wednesday that israel threatened to bomb an iraqi factory 
outside baghdad if it manufactured biological weapons 
they were responding to abctv reports out of washington earlier 
wednesday saying that israel warned iraq through the us government 
that it was planning a strike against such a facility 
the official iraqi news agency quoted an iraqi foreign ministry 
official as saying that iraq does not produce such weaopns 
if we receive such a threat iraq will reject it strongly 
the agency monitored in nicosia cyprus quoted the unidentified 
official as saying 
motti amihai spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry said 
there is no truth to that information that we did threaten iraq 
he also said israel did not ask the united states or any other 
country to pass along any such warning 
amihai said israel was studying the reports that the iraqi 
government was developing biological weapons if this information 
is true we are facing here one more proof of the irresponsibility 
of the iraqi government 
amihai refused to comment on israels knowledge of the iraqi 
plant israeli sources said this month that iraq is on the verge of 
developing biological weapons but has not yet produced any 
when asked if israel would consider an air raid similar to the 
1981 attack that destroyed an iraqi nuclear facility amihai replied 
one should bear in mind that israel is very sensitive about its 
security we will take all measures necessary to ensure the 
security of the state of israel

an iraqi nuclear research facility at tuwaitha outside baghdad

a roosevelt university graduate just wanted 
students to have fun and he left 275 million to make sure 
what a guy said jeff rosenberg 24 a senior majoring in 
sociology they should use it to hold cheap concerts with good 
groups nothing big a reunion of rock group led zeppelin or 
something like that 
hollywood agent marvin moss 59 died of cancer in 1986 in los 
angeles he left the bulk of his estate to roosevelt saying the 
money should be spent only on social and recreational amenities 
because as a citytype school i never felt students socialized as 
much as they might have 
on wednesday some of the 6000 students at the private liberal 
arts school offered some ideas for spending the gift which 
officials said was the largest in the schools 43year history 
moss gift will pay for a gymnasium and fitness center and 
renovatations to student lounges said roosevelt president theodore 
gross about 400000 will be set aside to create a student 
activities fund gross said 
some students said the funds were needed to add enthusiasm to 
student gatherings 
they should have parties at nice hotels and get a dj who knows 
how to play really good music said beatrice franklin a junior 
studying biology 
we need better food daryl mclaurine 21 said patting his 
stomach i like food 
moss represented actress shirley maclaine the late actor desi 
arnaz and john avildsen who directed the movie rocky he 
graduated in 1948 from roosevelt with a degree in commerce 
roosevelt has received 225 million and expects to get the 
remaining 500000 in about a year said robert shepard vice 
president for development 
mr moss was a modest donor every year and we tried to convince 
him to contribute more shepard said he told us dont worry 
youre in my will and someday youll be rich 
the gift to roosevelt was not the only bequest moss made to give 
people a good time 
he was a member of the los angeles wine and food society and had 
an outstanding wine cellar which he left to the university of 
california said his lawyer daniel sklar 
he also left 20000 for a blacktie party for his friends and 
business associates in beverly hills calif said susan whyberd a

american nuclear plants perform worse than foreign 
ones because of a lack of cooperation among us utilities and 
hostility between them and regulators says a massachusetts 
institute of technology study 
what the us utilities dont seem to have typically is a 
culture of reaching out to one another on a companybycompany 
basis said professor michael golay a nuclear engineer and one of 
the reports authors 
the report financed by the us department of energy mit and 
two electric companies was to be released thursday in the latest 
issue of the school magazine technology review 
the study looked at plants in japan sweden france switzerland 
west germany and the united states from 1975 to 1984 in the united 
states it examined the nearly 200 light water reactors producing 
more than 300 megawatts 
the average plant in the united states produced energy less than 
60 percent of the time while most of the other countries at the end 
of the period were at 75 percent said mit professor kent hansen 
the projects chief author 
one of our conjectures is that all elements concerned with 
nuclear power have not been able to work together to solve nuclear 
problems hansen said 
golay said that when japan decided to improve the available of 
nucleargenerated power they did it by making it a national goal 
the us has tried to do some of that but so far in terms of 
availability it has failed 
what is unique to the united states is a highly antagonistic 
relationship between regulators and utilities the report said 
in other countries relationships between regulators and 
utilities become strained at times but all parties report that 
communication is open and forthright with no group withholding 
information or acting secretly or vindictively nor do 
politicians attempt to interfere in regulatory decisions 
golay said much of the hostility is the consequence of 
operating in a goldfish bowl in other countries they operate behind 
closed doors 
nuclear industry spokesman scott peters agreed with the 
assessment of 60 percent efficiency but in a telephone interview 
from the us council for energy awareness in washington he said 
were getting better 
as for cooperation among utilities after the 1979 accident at 
three mile island in pennsylvania utilities set up a computer link 
to share information and the industry also has established the 
institute of nuclear power operators 
he noted that in france where nuclear power facilities are 
considered outstanding the government owns the utility 
thats a fairly simple relationship ours is more complex the 
nuclear regulatory commission is careful not to get too close to the 
industry theres an arms length relationship as it should be 
he said 
but he added i dont think its contributing to inefficency

fireretardant plywood used to build roofs on 
thousands of multiplefamily dwellings nationwide can weaken and 
collapse after prolonged exposure to the suns heat building 
industry officials said wednesday 
it really is not the type of problem where people will have to 
worry about their roofs caving in on them at night when theyre 
sleeping said marshall frost a civil engineer and president of 
frost christenson and associates in florham park 
but builders say the fireretardant plywood weakens after five to 
six years and starts to sag and could collapse under the weight of 
heavy snow 
fireretardant plywood is marketed by several companies under 
various brand names each company uses a different compound to 
impregnate the wood to resist fire 
the treated plywood has been used for roofing for more then a 
decade in multiplefamily dwellings to keep fire from bypassing 
firewalls and spreading easily across the roofs of adjacent 
apartments but officials only recently realized there was a problem 
the american plywood association of tacoma wash said it first 
learned of the problem in 1986 when it began to get complaints from 
engineers 
these were totally different than any other thing wed ever 
heard about said steve zylkowski an apa scientist we didnt 
know what to attribute the problem to 
inspectors found the problem was a chemical reaction in the fire 
retardant chemicals caused by the suns heat zylkowski said the 
chemical reaction produces an acid that weakens the wood over 
several years 
a committee formed by the national association of home builders 
will meet sunday in atlanta to discuss a solution 
the new jersey builders association and the national plywood 
group are advising builders to refrain from using fireretardant 
wood until researchers at the national forest products association 
laboratory in madison wis can determine what chemicals are 
causing the wood deterioration 
until the industry comes up with meaningful controls to control 
their problems we will not recommend use of their products 
zylkowski said if they do have a problem we recommend strongly 
that they get assurance from the treatment companies that the 
problem will not recur 
meanwhile builders suggest annual inspections of roofs 
many suppliers and chemical manufacturers are working with the 
forest products association to develop a testing method for the 
fireretardant chemicals said susan levan a researcher for the 
group 
ms levan said 6000 specimens of plywood are being tested 
we hope to be able to prove that if you know certain lengths of 
time that the wood is at elevated temperatures we will be able to 
predict the life of the wood she said 
the next problem is who should pay for replacing faulty materials 
which have been used in thousands of dwellings 
thats a 64000 question frost said somewhere along the 
line the courts will figure out who is responsible to fix it there 
are a lot of discussions going on in the industry i think the 
industry will find a solution which might require some changes

when devastating urban rioting hit miami in 1980 
few police officers had special training and the city paid for it 
in 1980 we had the worst riot in the history of the united 
states it started with murder and got worse there were short 
budgets police departments were understaffed said george green 
46 who retired from the department as a captain in 1985 
in the racial violence of 1989 however the miami and metro dade 
police have a plan thanks to green 
i would say miami is one of the few towns that has citizens who 
are disturbancetrained said miami police spokesman sgt david 
rivero they know what to do thats an unfortunate thing to say 
about this town but its a fact 
in 1980 when riots that killed 18 people and injured hundreds 
hit the liberty city neighborhood the miami police force had only 
670 officers and there was no master plan 
people traveling through the riot area were dragged from their 
cars and killed some even mutilated police officers were trapped 
alone barriers werent set up properly 
it was a whole bunch of police officers trying to do the job 
but not as a cohesive group said green 
if things could go wrong they probably did he said but 
those lessons were welllearned 
today police move in coordinated field force units groups 
of eight or more cars with four men in each squad leaders are 
named each officer has certain duties some watch the cars others 
carry the tear gas others drive 
whenever one car in the field force moves all of the cars move 
quick action is taken to set up perimeters limiting movement of 
people into and out of a trouble zone 
rivero says the force is trained for about 10 hours every six 
months we go out and pretend that were out there fighting a 
disturbance have policeman posing as rioters 
green suggested after the 1980 riots that a new approach was 
needed and was told you are elected you are now known as the 
urban crisis officer 
it turned out to be a prudent move 
the biggest thing that became apparent to me was that police 
officers on a daily basis are trained to deal with the public in a 
positive manner he said but in a civil disorder it is the 
police against the citizens 
its difficult to go from serviceoriented to a militarytype 
approach he said 
he read military literature and considered the tools available 
the field force system he developed for miami became a popular one 
in law enforcement 
dade county adopted the system tampa adopted elements of it 
officials from chicago los angeles and new orleans and england have 
studed the approach

limelight on school teachers wednesday promising to use the white 
house to reward excellence and raise standards in americas schools 
and to rivet the nations attention on reforming education 
i am awed by your work he told 238 teachers invited from 
every state as special guests for the inauguration many of them in 
turn seemed awed by the glowing tribute from the next president 
one called it breathtaking 
even under budgetary constraints bush said were going to 
work to make sure that the nation does what needs to be done for our 
schools reward excellence raise standards expand choice 
publicize success strive to resolve shortcomings and keep american 
attention and effort concentrated on further education reform and 
improvement 
later at a gathering of republican party leaders bush paid 
tribute to president reagan declaring that he could never have won 
the election without his help 
and as the sun set on a warm winters day that seemed like 
springtime the presidentelect presidd over a spectacular ceremony 
at the lincoln memorial that began with the blare of military 
trumpets and ended with the brilliant thunder of fireworks that sent 
a flock of geese scurrying over the reflecting pool 
when the beach boys played help me rhonda several of bushs 
youngest grandchildren danced before their delighted elders 
the ceremony featured a flyover by 21 military jets a precision 
landing by four army parachutists and a rendition of god bless 
the usa by lee greenwood that bush said sent chills down his 
spine then bush came forward and delivered a brief poignant speech 
he recited lincolns words engraved on the walls of the memorial 
government of the people by the people and for the people 
that is the kind of government i plan to lead he said i 
will try hard to be a president of all the people 
he paid homage to ronald reagan and his great presidency that 
has made america strong once again but said the job is not 
complete some are still hurting and we care so let this 
inauguration be a time to celebrate who we are but let it also be a 
time to remember who we can be 
the crowd shone miniature flashlights at bushs command bringing 
his thousand points of life to life a symbol of my vision of 
americas greatness everyone who pitches in and builds up 
from the lincoln memorial bush and vice presidentelect dan 
quayle went to the headquarters of the department of health and 
human services where bush pledged to bring the disabled into the 
mainstream of american life 
he told the gathering of 500 people many of them blind or in 
wheelchairs that the disabled have been excluded for too long 
from the mainstream he promised to do what i can to correct 
all of that 
bush attended a reunion at his new temporary quarters at blair 
house with the world war ii submarine crewmen who rescued him as a 
downed flier in the pacific then capped the day off by making the 
rounds of a trio of a trio of 1500aplate inaugural dinners 
but bush chose to start the fiveday whirlwind of official 
inaugural activities with a speech at a forum honoring 238 top 
teachers drawn from state teachers of the year union leaders and 
others chosen by governors and republican advisory committees 
reiterating his pledge to be the education president bush 
told the educators my most important message to americas 
teachers is a message of appreciation 
this is my very first event on the inaugural calendar bush 
told the teachers at the national museum of women in the arts 
thats the way i wanted it meeting with educators 
education will be on my desk and on my mind right from the 
start every day he promised 
i am awed by your work and it is tough work and its 
indispensable work and it deserves as much praise and thanks as any 
job in any profession in america certainly you deserve more 
public recognition than you usually get 
then expressing a thought often spoken by his defeated 
democratic rival michael dukakis during the campaign bush added 
teaching should be one of americas honored professions and i will 
work to make sure that it is exactly that 
paul parets a band teacher at alexis i dupont high school in 
wilmington del called the bush speech really a very 
breathtaking experience 
i sat there thinking he could have met with the heads of 
foreign states he could have met with the leaders of the military 
or the captains of industry and instead he chose to meet with 
teachers from across the united states said parets a past 
delaware teacher of the year whose high school band will march in 
the inaugural parade 
moving on to the republican national committee luncheon where his 
campaign chairman lee atwater was installed as the new party 
chief bush offered warm praise for reagan whom he said was leaving 
office with a 68 percent approval rating 
it speaks so much about the man and his accomoplishments 
bush said i dont believe id be standing here as president 
eleect of the united states if it hadnt been for the way president 
reagan treated me as vice president and then the way he rolled up 
his sleeves and went to work in many of your states helping his vice 
president be elected 
when i go say farewell to him tomorrow it wont be too easy 
he said 
bush also joked that he was glad to be out of the house on a day 
when the family belongings were being moved out of their residence 
of the past eight years the naval observatory mansion he said he 
was purposely giving his wife barbara a little elbow room 
shes getting tough around the house said bush see a 
halffilled crate and she puts me to work and shes mean and tough 
and ugly about it she doesnt show any understanding 
i dont care if i see her for another 48 hours because i know 
therell be another crate that she will say move this one over 
here he quipped getting tired of that after all i got big 
responsibilities being put on my shoulders

government troops clashed with rebels 
at least 20 times jan 916 and at least 17 people were killed 
military sources said wednesday 
the fighting was in the southwestern provinces of boaco 
chontales and rio san juan the area has been the focus of activity 
by the usbacked rebels known as contras since the rebels and 
the leftist sandinista government signed a tentative ceasefire 
agreement last march 
at least 13 rebels and four soldiers were killed and three 
soldiers were wounded the sources said speaking on condition of 
anonymity 
the defense ministry meanwhile accused honduran troops of 
shooting toward the border post of murupuchi in northern nueva 
segovia province on sunday it mentioned no casualties 
nicaragua says the post is harassed almost daily by honduran 
troops 
col manuel suarez benavides chief spokesman for the honduran 
armed forces called the allegations absolutely false and said 
they apparently form part of a new nicaraguan propaganda offensive 
against honduras 
it also is completely false that honduran troops have 
repeatedly harassed sandinista forces in murupuchi he told the 
associated press 
a series of sandinistacontra meetings after the march 23 signing 
of the temporary truce failed to define terms for a permanent 
agreement talks broke off on june 9 
fighting declined sharply after the signing which came a month 
after the united states cut off military aid to the contras most of 
the rebels moved back to base camps in honduras but sporadic 
fighting continues

trial of one of two men charged in 11 sniper attacks on isolated 
homes in the blackstone valley north of here 
jurors were told the trial could take six weeks and include as 
many as 60 witnesses 
jury selection began after superior court judge dominic f cresto 
denied a motion by peter t trepaniers attorneys to dismiss the 
charges because of lengthy trial delays he also dismissed a defense 
motion to delay the trial still further because of alleged 
prejudicial pretrial publicity 
a group of about 70 potential jurors filled the courtroom as eva 
marie mancuso assistant attorney general read a list of the dozens 
of witnesses who could be called to testify 
trepanier 25 and a second defendant russell j ducharme ii 
24 face 39 charges each including arson and assault with intent to 
commit murder the charges stem from a series of attacks on isolated 
homes in the woonsocket area in december 1986 and january 1987 
both men if convicted could face maximum sentences of life in 
prison 
six potential jurors wednesday were asked if they were familar 
with any of the witnesses or if they had ever been victims of crimes 
the prospective jurors also were questioned about whether any of 
the extensive publicity about the case would color their judgment 
two people were dismissed but for unrelated personal reasons 
defense lawyers citing pretrial publicity tried unsuccessfully 
last summer to have the trial moved from providence 
trepanier of burrillville surrendered to police in october 
1987 10 months after the last shooting was reported in north 
smithfield 
ducharme of smithfield was arrested and charged the next day

attorneys who want to save theodore bundy 
from floridas electric chair next week filed a circuit court appeal 
wednesday and a hearing was scheduled for thursday morning court 
officials said 
theyve raised three claims for relief said carolyn 
snurkowski chief death penalty attorney for floridas attorney 
general office 
two of the arguments deal with bundys murder convictions in the 
deaths of two sorority sisters at florida state university ms 
snurkowski said the third deals with bundys mental state 
bundy 42 is scheduled to die tuesday for the february 1978 
murder of kimberly leach a 12yearold lake city girl 
his lawyers say the question of bundys sanity is not settled 
though the us supreme court refused tuesday to consider the issue 
in the lake city case 
the lawyers say that bundys two other florida cases should be 
linked to the lake city case on the question of his sanity bundy 
42 also is under death sentences for fatally bludgeoning two 
florida state university sorority sisters three weeks before leach 
was killed 
in 1979 bundy was declared legally sane to stand trial for the 
sorority murders that ruling was used recently by appeals courts to 
reject bundys claim that he is insane and should not be executed 
for the leach murder 
on dec 12 us district judge william zloch in fort lauderdale 
reopened the sanity issue in the sorority case saying he would hear 
evidence as early as monday 
bundys lawyers say that decision leaves bundys sanity in doubt 
and that he should not be executed until it is resolved 
defense lawyers and prosecutors have asked for a delay in the 
federal court hearing while they deal with the death warrant

tony ridley who resigned as london transport chief 
because of a disastrous subway fire was chosen wednesday as joint 
managing director by the consortium building an undersea rail link 
between england and france 
relatives of people killed in the subway fire objected 
ridley resigned 10 weeks ago as head of london regional 
transport which runs the subways when an official report cited 
executive complacency as a factor in the blaze that killed 31 people 
nov 18 1987 
my first reaction was well im certainly not going to use the 
tunnel said sophie tarassenko whose brother ivan was killed in 
the escalator fire at the busy kings cross station 
it seems to me safety is paramount in such a thing as the 
channel tunnel and to have such a man appointed seems a very odd 
decision she said 
miss tarassenko is chairwoman of the kings cross families action 
group formed after the fire 
the official report said management was fundamentally in 
error in considering fires inevitable and that it had not put a 
high priority on safety 
eurotunnel the anglofrench consortium boring the undersea link 
beneath the english channel said wednesday it chose ridley and 
alain bertrand as joint managing directors the tunnel is scheduled

president reagans successors would have the 
power to shield portions of the papers of the reagan presidency from 
disclosure under an executive order issued by the president 
wednesday 
the order spells out procedures to be followed by reagan and 
other former presidents in claiming executive privilege with regard 
to their presidential papers 
these claims would be subject to review by the archivist but the 
archivist would be bound by any instructions given him by the 
incumbent president unless otherwise instructed by court order 
thus if reagan asserted executive privilege to keep some of his 
papers under wraps and a later president supported him the 
archivist would be prohibited from disclosing them unless ordered by 
a court 
the order arises out of protracted litigation over claims of 
executive privilege by former president nixon with regard to his 
papers 
a justice department opinion in 1986 said the archivist is a 
presidential appointee and must comply with the presidents claim of 
privilege even when it is invoked in support of a former president 
that opinion also said an incumbent president was bound to support 
an executive privilege claim by a former president except in rare 
cases when it would conflict with his constitutional duties 
the opinion touched off criticism in congress where some 
lawmakers said it would let reagan and future presidents keep their 
own papers under seal years after they have left office 
reagans order establishes procedures governing the assertion of 
executive privilege by both present and former presidents 
it provides that when the archivist decides on release of papers 
of a former president he would notify both the former president and 
the incumbent identifying any materials he thinks might be subject 
to executive privilege 
the incumbent and former presidents however would be free to 
assert executive privilege with regard to any papers whether or not 
identified by the archivist 
the archivist would be free to release the papers if he did not 
receive a claim of executive privilege within 30 days 
if he received such a claim from the incumbent president he 
would be prohibited from disclosing the records unless directed to 
do so by the president or a final court order 
when he received a claim of privilege by a former president the 
archivist would consult with the attorney general and the counsel to 
the president and then make a determination as to whether to honor 
the former presidents claim of privilege or instead to disclose the 
presidential records notwithstanding the claim of privilege 
any determination that executive privilege shall not be 
invoked by the incumbent president shall not prejudice the 
archivists determination with respect to the former presidents 
claim of privilege the order said 
however it said in making the determination the archivist 
shall abide by any instructions given him by the incumbent president 
or his designee unless otherwise directed by a final court order 
all presidents before nixon took their papers with them when they 
left office but under a 1978 law reagans documents and those of 
his successors will become public property that law requires the 
archivist to decide which papers to withhold and which to make 
public 12 years after a president leaves office

members of irans parliament on wednesday 
demanded a tougher judiciary system that would crack down on 
widespread corruption the islamic republic news agency reported 
irans official news agency monitored in nicosia said a letter 
to the judiciary signed by 190 lawmakers read it is in the 
interest of the county to strengthen the judiciary as soon as 
possible according to the leader of the islamic revolution 
ayatollah ruhollah khomeini 
irna said the letter advised the judiciary to heed the warning 
adding that failure to do so could cause irreparable harm 
the call reflects public concern over government graft and other 
issues put to one side after the iraniraq war began in september 
1980 
parliament deputy rajai khorasani told students in northwestern 
tabriz province last month that corruption was a major reason for 
irans agreeing to a unmediated ceasefire last august 
last month parliament came under attack for voting down a bill 
demanding that all government officials incomes be investigated 
members opposing the measure among them speaker hashemi 
rafsanjani said it was too farreaching in requiring that 
mediumlevel officials such as bank managers and heads of 
stateowned corporations be investigated 
in an effort to demonstrate a tough stand on corruption however 
the government last month sentenced multimillionaire ali mousavi to 
death for defrauding war victims families 
also an expediency council formed by khomeini to expedite 
legislation bypassed both judiciary and parliament in passing a 
draconian law against drug smugglers 
the new law to take effect at the end of this week carries a 
death sentence for anyone found in possession of more than 30 grams 
just over one ounce of specified hard drugs and 11 pounds of any 
narcotic 
according to tehran television reports also monitored in 
nicosia the public welcomed the crackdown 
already 75 people have been hanged in advance of the new law 
and hundreds of tons of narcotics have been seized

panasonic agreed wednesday to refund up to 16 
million to settle charges that the japanese electronics company 
cheated consumers nationwide by fixing prices the state attorney 
general said 
the scam elevated prices by an average of 5 to 10 percent on 
many of its products attorney general robert abrams said at a 
news conference in a few short months over 15 million was 
extorted from consumers in the form of higher prices 
the alleged scheme involved 16 products sold under the panasonic 
and technics labels including videocassette recorders videotape 
cameras cordless telephones answering machines and stereo 
equipment abrams said 
in the settlement filed in us district court in manhattan 
panasonic agreed to make refunds to 665000 consumers nationwide who 
purchased panasonic products between march 1 and aug 31 1988 
abrams said the company began the scheme in march but ended it 
after six months when it learned of his investigation panasonic had 
planned to extend the scheme to eventually include all of its 
products abrams said 
panasonic coerced retailers into charging full list prices for 
its products by threatening to stop supplying stores that sold its 
equipment below the suggested retail price he said 
the attorney general described an elaborate nationwide scheme 
involving scores of panasonic sales executives pressuring thousands 
of retailers throughout the country to comply with the scheme and 
then panasonic actually monitoring the prices that they charged 
panasonic denied any wrongdoing but agreed to make the refunds 
we voluntarily resolved the matter in the belief that a quick 
settlement would help avoid protracted and costly litigation and 
disruption to our dealers and our business said ralph wolfe a 
panasonic vice president 
consumers who bought any of the products during the six months of 
the alleged scheme and sent in warranty cards will be notified they 
are eligible for a refund and mailed the necessary forms 
the company also agreed to publish newspaper advertisements 
telling its customers how to get their refunds abrams said

the senate president said wednesday 
that ousted president ferdinand marcos has offered to return an 
undisclosed amount of money stashed in swiss banks in exchange for 
permission to return home 
sen jovito salonga said the offer was made in an august letter 
and was the second such offer made by marcos 
salonga formerly headed a government body charged with recovering 
marcos fortune 
presidential executive secretary catalino macaraig confirmed that 
a proposal to return 5 billion was made in july but was rejected by 
the government which says marcos his family and associates 
illegally garnered up to 10 billion during his 20year presidency 
president corazon aquino said on wednesday she had received no 
formal unequivocal offers directly from marcos she had said she 
would let marcos return only if he returned money obtained illegally 
while in office 
it marcos offer was not very clear it was coursed through 
third parties and there was not anything definite until things 
are put down in writing and formally addressed to me i guess we 
cannot really study the matter mrs aquino told reporters 
marcos 71 was toppled in the february 1986 peoples power 
uprising that swept mrs aquino into power and forced marcos into 
hawaiian exile 
he marcos signed a document offering to transfer to the 
philippine government the disputed funds in the swiss banks 
salonga told reporters no amount was indicated in the letter 
salonga said the letter was signed in the presence of an allan 
weinstein an american professor who was to act as a 
representative of marcos to deal with the philippine government 
salonga said 
marcos faces 39 civil cases in the philippines involving 
embezzlement no criminal charges have been filed against marcos or 
his family philippine laws prohibit trial in the absence of the 
defendant 
on oct 21 a us federal grand jury indicted marcos his wife 
imelda and eight other associates on racketeering charges they 
were accused of plundering their homeland of 103 million to buy new 
york real estate and defrauding us banks of more than 165 million 
between 19721986 
mrs marcos pleaded not guilty 
marcos lawyers told a federal judge in new york on wednesday he 
is unable to stand trial there on racketeering charges because he is 
dying 
the manila government has refused to allow the marcoses to return 
for fear that their civilian and military supporters would undermine 
the 35month old aquino administration mrs aquino has faced at 
least five coup attempts mostly from troops loyal to marcos

a broken home a history of childhood 
drinking and a criminal record might have been warnings but 
authorities said wednesday they may never know why patrick purdy 
attacked a schoolyard full of children with an assault rifle 
purdy a loner who often worked as a welder in his travels around 
the country apparently lived in a bizarre fantasy world involving 
the military and the middle east 
when he slipped onto the cleveland elementary school grounds 
shortly before noon tuesday he was wearing a flak jacket and an 
olive drab tshirt with the words death to the great satin not 
satan on the back and plo libya and earthman also 
written on it 
in a room at the el rancho motel where he lived in the weeks 
leading up to the massacre police found about 100 plastic toy 
soldiers a broken 22caliber rifle and an olive drab cloth bearing 
drawings of three snarlingtype faces and the words v for 
victory and f for freedom 
his weapons bore similar markings including the word 
hezbollah the name of a proiranian shiite moslem faction in 
lebanon 
what the significance of that is i do not know said stockton 
police capt dennis perry on wednesday he obviously had a 
military hangup of some kind 
it suggests that this guy may have had delusions of grandeur 
about iran he said 
perry said purdy was arrested in los angeles in 1980 on charges 
involving prostitution in 1982 by los angeles county sheriffs 
deputies on a marijuana charge in 1983 in beverly hills for 
manufacture or sale of an illegal weapon in 1983 by los angeles 
deputies for receiving stolen property and in woodland about 50 
miles north of here on a robbery charge 
perry did not know the disposition of some of those cases but 
said purdy served jail time in the last two cases 
julia chumbley purdys 63yearold grandmother figures purdys 
motive died with him when he took his own life tuesday in stockton 
15 miles south of her home in lodi in the farmingrich san joaquin 
valley 
i dont understand why and i probably wont ever know why 
said chumbley a retired cannery worker in a telephone interview 
an aunt julie michael of sandy ore said that despite being 
the product of a broken home and having a criminal record and a 
history of childhood alcoholism purdy did not display hate or other 
outward signs of impending disaster 
when he was around here he acted well chumbley said 
chumbley said her grandson who also went by the alias patrick 
west had only a normal interest in guns as a child 
all boys that age like guns she said its normal for that 
age isnt it 
purdys father patrick benjamin purdy a lodi cab company 
employee was struck and killed by a car in september 1981 the 
death disturbed the younger purdy but chumbley said he seemed to 
have recovered from the loss 
as for why most of the victims were southeast asian refugees 
chumbley said as far as i know he was not prejudiced were not 
a prejudiced family we werent raised that way 
she said his parents were married in stockton then divorced 
after a short time his mother remarried and took purdy to the lake 
tahoe nev region and then on to the sacramento area 
he dropped out of high school and began drifting living briefly 
in several communities she said in stockton his grandmother 
remembers a girlfriend but that was some time ago she added 
in june purdy traveled to oregon where he worked in portland as 
a welder for a time lived with an aunt and uncle and bought the 
assault rifle then continued on to colorado texas and finally 
connecticut chumbley said 
thats where i sent his christmas present i thought he was 
still there i didnt even know he was back she said

a communist party leader said wednesday the 
way is clear to make the solidarity trade union legal again gen 
wojciech jaruzelski won a vote of confidence after offering to 
resign in a bitter internal fight 
the policymaking central committees vote of confidence kept 
jaruzelski party leader and head of state in power on the second 
day of a meeting in which the party debated union freedoms the 
official pap news agency said 
the meeting led to a party resolution that paves the way for the 
relegalization of solidarity said chief party ideologist marian 
orzechowski 
jaruzelski and other key members of the ruling politburo 
including prime minister mieczyslaw rakowski and interior minister 
gen czeslaw kiszczak offered to give up their party and government 
posts pap said 
in an unusual description of the heated debate pap reported 
accusations that party policy was incomprehensible faulty and 
often contradictory of the expectations and view of party members 
pap said the doubts of the 230member central committee were 
justified by the bad experiences of 19801981 
solidarity the soviet blocs first independent union movement 
was formed during labor unrest in 1980 crushed with martial law in 
1981 and outlawed in 1982 
the 230member central committee gave jaruzelski and the other 
leaders a vote of confidence with only four abstentions 
it was the first time the government reported such a resignation 
offer suggesting growing official openness 
pap said the central committee passed a position paper on 
political and union freedoms by a vote of 14332 with 14 
abstentions 
the text was not released but orzechowski told state radio it 
was a great turning point 
it opens the road to restoration of trade union pluralism 
including solidarity formulating at the same time a number of 
conditions which have to be fulfilled so the road is not too 
bumpy orzechowski said 
we dont know the reaction of the other side yet he said 
solidarity leader lech walesa had insisted on a clear party 
statement of its willingness to recognize his union before he would 
enter talks with the government on polands future 
state department spokesman charles redman said in washington that 
the polish leaderships stated willingness to relegalize the 
solidarity trade union under certain conditions is a step forward 
relegalization would be a major achievement on the road to 
polands reform and recovery we would welcome it 
rakowski had asked the central committee for a green light to 
offer to restore the unions legal status for a twoyear trial 
period on condition it help the government in its economic and 
political reforms 
orzechowski said the conditions stem from our experiences and 
from the foreseen potential effects of the developing events he 
urged the opposition to show a sense of responsiblity 
a draft of the original resolution on trade union freedoms 
obtained by western news agencies said that at proposed talks with 
the opposition the organizational forms of expanded national 
reconciliation should be determined 
there should also be agreed conditions means and a schedule of 
introducing trade union pluralism and opening the road for creation 
of new trade unions including solidarity 
it was not known if the language concerning solidarity was 
altered during the party debate in which many central committee 
members spoke against solidarity 
solidarity has remained active despite the ban first as an 
underground organization and later increasingly tolerated by 
authorities recently walesa has been treated as a member of the 
constructive opposition whose views are carried in the media 
officials have said they would like solidaritys support in 
maintaining calm as the government introduces its potentially 
disruptive reforms 
officials believe an agreement with solidarity would also help 
the government obtain badly needed western credits 
on tuesday rakowski urged a conditional offer of legalization to 
solidarity so long as the union agrees to act as a partner not a 
political opponent 
he said solidarity would have to declare itself a part of 
socialism and disassociate itself from anticommunist groups 
observe a strike moratorium and give up financial assistance from 
the west which has amounted to millions of dollars 
legalization would come only after the twoyear probationary 
period when both sides would evaluate positive and negative 
experiences rakowski said 
a solidarity source in warsaw said privately that the conditions 
set by rakowski initially appeared unacceptable 
but krzysztof sliwinski an independent journalist associated 
with solidarity was more optimistic 
emphasizing that he was giving his own view and not the unions 
sliwinski said it seems to be a commitment to recognize 
solidarity so i would would consider it an important first step 
that was very difficult for them 
sliwinski said the most difficult condition for the union to 
accept would be a moratorium on striking which rakowski suggested 
should last two years 
walesa has said many times that he does not want to organize 
strikes sliwinski said but without the right to strike there 
is no use being a union 
true partnership with the government would be impossible under 
those conditions because all the power is on the other side he 
said

we will have to look at the possibility of increasing numbers 
and of increasing dollars for the refugee program baker said at 
his confirmation hearing before the senate foreign relations 
committee 
in addition baker said the problem of the glut of refugees in 
firstasylum countries the places they gather after leaving their 
homelands to await permanent moves will occupy our time and 
attention early in the new administration 
bakers comments came as he underwent a second day of friendly 
questioning on his nomination to lead the state department in the 
new administration the full committee was expected to vote to 
approve his appointment on thursday and the senate was scheduled to 
meet jan 25 to act on that and other nominations 
on other subjects 
responding to questions about two longpending treaties with the 
soviet union baker said agreement is complete on verification 
procedures for the 1976 peaceful nuclear explosions treaty and 
nearly complete on verification rules for the 1974 nuclear test ban 
treaty 
the two will be sent together to the senate for ratification 
baker said but he declined to say when 
baker said he had reservations about us participation in a 
scheduled 1991 international human rights conference in moscow but 
he added we made a commitment and we plan to keep it so long as 
conditions for improvements in soviet human rights performance are 
met 
asked how he interprets changes being made by soviet leader 
mikhail gorbachev in regard to the soviet unions approach to the 
rest of the world baker said the jury is still out thats why 
we should approach our relationship with prudence and a certain 
degree of realism 
he said he was not in a position to prejudge what we would 
do if yasser arafat leader of the palestine liberation 
organization applied for a visa to visit the united states 
secretary of state george shultz rejected such a request from arafat 
last november but arafat has since made statements more to us 
officials liking concerning terrorism and israel 
answering a question prompted by documents at the heart of the 
irancontra affair he said he believed all of the officials who by 
law are members of the national security council the president 
the vice president and the secretaries of state and defense should 
be informed of presidential decisions to undertake covert actions 
overseas 
baker said he believed that bush as a former united nations 
ambassador would be inclined to include in his budget request not 
only full funding for the us share of the world bodys operating 
costs but also installments on paying back dues accumulated during 
the reagan administration 
baker is very skillful as he should be and im impressed 
said sen nancy kassebaum rkan expressing a view apparently 
shared by many panel members 
i think hes going to make an excellent secretary of state and 
im ready to vote added sen terry sanford dnc 
on the subject of refugees the state department said last week 
that the quota for soviet and other east european refugees would be 
raised by 7000 this year and the quota for vietnamese refugees 
would be lowered because many of the vietnamese are former political 
prisoners unable to emigrate 
baker said the plight of some vietnamese was a major problem 
closer to home baker said he was unaware of reports cited by 
sen jesse helms rnc that the united states through the cia or 
some other avenue is covertly financing the campaign of the 
christian democratic party in el salvadors presidential elections 
scheduled for march 
im not familiar with what you have suggested is taking 
place baker told helms he said he generally does not approve of 
covert us funding of political campaigns in other countries but 
said that on occasions it could be appropriate to defeat parties 
or personalities inimical to the united states 
on still another subject responding to a question from sen john 
kerry dmass baker said i think you will see a new approach 
toward acid rain from this administration although he did not say 
what that approach would be the reagan administration often was 
criticized particularly by canada for dragging its feet on taking 
action to mitigate the problem

about 2500 republican stalwarts and wealthy 
contributors feasted on a 1500aplate dinner and toasted george 
bushs presidency wednesday night unmindful of noisy protesters 
outside who chanted feed the poor not the rich and what about 
the homeless 
two days before their inauguration the presidentelect and his 
vice presidentelect dan quayle toured the lavish dinners at three 
sites around the city including the newly refurbished union station 
where dozens of street people ate hot chili and rice from a 
makeshift soup kitchen on the plaza out in front 
inside the blacktie guests expressed little concern about the 
message the demonstraters were shouting 
i feel its ridiculous said thomas j stewart a seattle 
business executive they hold these staged events every time 
republicans get together and its in very poor taste 
the people here have probably contributed more as individuals 
and corporations to the welfare of this country than anybody else 
said tulsa okla oilman jim hewgley if they want to celebrate 
then by god theyre entitled to 
several hundred protesters demonstrated for three hours shouting 
at the limousines that pulled up to the main entrance at union 
station with inaugural dinner guests but dispersed peaceably as the 
dinner began in midevening 
three hours before the start of the union station dinner several 
hundred street people enjoyed a counter inaugural banquet of hot 
chili and rice tortilla chips salad and apple cider on the plaza 
in front of union station 
while they ate off of paper plates the homeless listened to 
guitar players and watched a proabortion street theater featuring a 
man in tennis shoes wearing a bush mask and a sign reading i 
oppose abortion hanging around his neck 
protesters organized by a group called the counterinaugural 
coalition for a peoples agenda carried placards reading food 
not bombs george knew and the skies are for stars not 
war another sign under a huge peace symbol read now appearing 
in a fouryear show son of reaganstein costarring big bird 
bush and quayle were guests of honor at the lavish dinners 
attended by more than 2500 republican stalwarts and fatcat 
contributors the blacktie crowd was so large the dinners were held 
at union station and the nearby pension building and corcoran 
gallery of art 
for 1500 ticket each invited guest was to hear brief remarks 
by bush and quayle at the three dinner sites and feast on a 
fourcourse dinner 
outside of union station park police sgt robert kass banished a 
half dozen conservative republican counterdemonstrators for lack of 
a permit 
the leader of the group eugene delgaudio 34 executive director 
of the private ultraconservative activists group known as public 
advocate said he wanted to show theres a better way than 
openly political negativism he said his demonstrators were to 
welcome the blacktie dinner guests with american flags and signs 
reading welcome nonliberals 
several homeless people paused between spoonfuls of chili to say 
that the 225 million in proceeds from the inaugural dinners should 
be spent to provide food additional shelters job training and 
subsidized public transportation for washingtons street people 
referring to the inaugural diners roosevelt carrington a 
30yearold homeless person said i think maybe they should eat 
the same thing were having so theyll know what its like 
said ronnie thompson 38 they done robbed most of it from 
us he said the inaugural dinner proceeds should be used for the 
homeless because a lot of them have given up 
more than 1000 people were served at the counterinaugural 
dinner at union station 
as guests began arriving shortly before 7 pm several hundred 
of the people at the counterinaugural banquet began shouting 
what about the homeless and 50000 dead from aids where was 
george 
although the park police allowed the demonstration to spread 
closer to the train depot than the demonstrators permit allowed 
the protestors remained 100 yards from the entrance where the 
invited guests were emerging from their cars and were barely audible 
from that distance 
at about 730 pm one half hour before the union station 
banquet would get officially underway the park police received 
reinforcement and barricades which were set up in front of the 
demonstrators 
park police sgt g f wallace asked whether the barricades had 
been planned in advance said im not in on these decisions but 
i imagine it was spontaneous because of the crowds activitywe 
cant have the police spread out or people can sneak through we 
should have had them up there before 
there was no indication that any of the invited guests to the 
union station dinner were even aware of the demonstration none of 
them came over to see what is going on 
at the majestic corcoran gallery of art dinner guests who also 
paid 1500 each were serenaded up a royal blue carpeted stairway by 
violins playing this could be the start of something big 
elegantly attired guests wandered through art displays ranging 
from modern neon art to traditional american pieces the gallery was 
hung with blue bunting with white stars and large arrangements of 
red roses decorated the corridors 
among the guests at the corcoran gala dinner were bushs longtime 
friend and commerce secretarydesignate robert mosbacher of texas 
and mosbachers socialite wife georgette mrs mosbacher like mrs 
bush and mrs quayle was dressed in a blackandwhite gown 
also among the guests were sen john warner rva and bushs 
son marvin and his wife margaret the younger bush said he was 
having fun but mostly waiting for fridays swearing in of his 
father 
the rest will be fun he said adding however the one we 
will all be looking forward to will be friday an incredibly proud 
moment for all of us 
his wife who wore a fitted strapless black gown with a brocade 
bodice said she had never seen george and barbara bush so excited 
as they have been with the inauguration approaching theyre like

massive fireworks display in keeping with his concept of the 
nations diversity and promise as a thousand points of light

marilyn quayle donned their formal wear and dropped in on three 
separate 1500perplate dinners for thousands of republican high

to hundreds of white house staffers we were all revolutionaries 
and the revolution has been a success reagan told 350 aides 
tears streamed down nancy reagans face as the marine band played 
auld lang syne 
bush told a meeting of the republican national committee that i 
dont believe id be standing here as presidentelect of the united 
states if it hadnt been for the way president reagan treated me as 
vice president and then the way he rolled up his sleeves and went 
to work helping his vice president be elected 
when i go say farewell to him tomorrow it wont be too easy 
he said were not coming in to correct the ills of the past 
were coming in to build on a proud record 
bush began the day with an address to americas educators this 
is my very first event on the inaugural calendar thats the way 
i wanted it he told 230 toprated public school teachers 
gathered from every state 
i know youve heard me say during this campaign that i intended 
to be the education president two days before i begin trying i 
wanted you to know that i meant it 
bush who attended the exclusive phillips academy at andover 
mass and earned his college degree and phi beta kappa key at yale 
told the teachers i am awed by your work 
education will be on my desk and on my mind right from the 
start he said 
with two days to go before he is sworn in bush was all over town 
first off he moved from the vice presidential mansion into 
lodgings closer to the white house then set off on a schedule 
crammed with social events including the reunion with his navy 
rescuers more than 44 years ago 
bush joked meanwhile that he was giving wife barbara a little 
elbow room while she was still in the throes of moving i dont 
care if i see her for another 48 hours because i know therell be 
another crate that she will say move this one over here 
he paused and added im getting tired of that after all 
ive got big responsibilities 
in private bush embraced 16 surviving crew members of the uss 
finback a world war ii submarine which rescued him after he bailed 
out when his tbm avenger torpedo bomber was struck by japanese fire 
bush who has accorded the finback veterans the choicest seats at 
several inaugural events welcomed them to his temporary quarters at 
the blair house to renew memories one don kohler of rogers ark 
the torpedoman who pulled bush from the drink said it was very 
emotional you have to remember that very few of us had seen any of 
the others for 44 years 
kohler said bush told the group that his relationships in the 
war helped him a great deal in guiding his life 
another recollection according to retired rear adm lawrence 
heyworth of virginia beach va once the finbacks gunnery officer 
was that the crew nicknamed bush ellie for his outstanding 
imitation of an elephant trumpeting 
that wasnt the stunt of an aspiring republican bush then 20 
merely had seen too many tarzan movies in the wardroom 
in his remarks to the school teachers bush said that even under 
budgetary constraints were going to work to make sure that the 
nation does what needs to be done for our schools reward 
excellence weigh standards expand choice publicize success 
strive to resolve shortcomings 
paul parets a band teacher at alexis i dupont high school in 
wilmington del said i was very moved i sat there thinking he 
could have met with the heads of foreign states he could have met 
with the leaders of the military or the captains of industry and 
instead he chose to meet with 230 teachers from across the united 
states

two virginia military institute cadets on 
christmas vacation robbed an armored car of 45 million in a plan 
conceived by one cadets father authorities said wednesday in 
announcing their arrests 
the father robert j jasinski 51 of boonton was a parttime 
driver for the coin depot armored car corp of elizabeth when one of 
its trucks was robbed dec 22 in clifton by two men dressed as 
police officers 
the two policemen were william t jasinski 22 and bryan 
smals 21 of columbus ohio cadets at the lexington va miltary 
school said john mcginley head of the fbis newark agency 
the elder jasinski met the hijacked armored car in a rented van 
to which the money was transferred the police uniforms were rented 
from a costume store in paramus mcginley said at a news conference 
a majority of the money was recovered from an attic crawl 
space at the home of a woman acquaintance of the elder jasinski 
mcginley said the woman whom he did not identify did not know 
what jasinski was storing and did not participate in the crime 
mcginley said 
the money displayed with a 9mm automatic was in a dozen plastic 
garbage bags and a footlocker 
mcginley said the cadets were arrested at their campus wednesday 
robert jasinski a retired telephone company worker was arrested at 
his home and held on 400000 bail 
the lawyer who represented the elder jasinski edward hartnett 
declined to comment on the charges 
all three were charged with interference with commerce by threats 
or violence which carries a 20year prison term upon conviction 
william jasinski a senior and smals a sophomore were friends 
on vacation from the military school when the crime was committed 
said mcginley 
the complaint said robert j jasinski was interviewed by an fbi 
agent on tuesday and at first denied the allegation he later 
admitted planning the robbery and implicated the cadets the 
complaint said 
in roanoke va wednesday night us magistrate glen conrad 
ordered the younger jasinski and smals held without bond pending 
their transfer to newark 
fbi agent frank butler said jasinski and smals confessed to the 
heist when they were questioned at vmi following their arrests and 
both cadets also admitted their guilt at the bond hearing 
the complaint is correct sir jasinski told conrad at the 
hearing 
mcginley said an investigation of employees after the robbery was 
instrumental in cracking the case he said jasinski drove the 
same route as the robbed truck 
authorities said the two robbers held up three employees of coin 
depot as they parked an armored car behind the first fidelity bank 
the car was to bring the cash to the federal reserve bank of new 
york 
they handcuffed the employees and drove them to a nearby 
industrial park freeing the three unharmed 
the fbi said the robbers wore policetype clothing including 
threequarter length blue nylon coats with fur collars blue police 
caps and police badges

those who only know david morrells work 
through the sylvester stallone rambo movies based on his books 
probably dont grasp the subtle subtexts 
but most of his 13 books including the bestseller brotherhood 
of the rose now an nbc miniseries revolve around fatherson 
relationships 
brotherhood of the rose a fourhour twopart miniseries is 
scheduled to air sunday after the super bowl and conclude monday it 
stars david morse and peter strauss as orphans trained by their 
adoptive father robert mitchum to be assassins but the father 
eventually betrays them 
the original rambo was based on morrells 1972 book first 
blood about a vietnam veteran who turns against the society that 
slights him even rambo is a surrogate son his former commander 
col trautman played by richard crenna in the movies is the father 
figure 
though he is known for writing in the actionadventure genre 
morrell has written a book called fireflies about the death last 
year of his 15yearold son matthew 
ive had more response from that book than anything else ive 
written he said ive heard from people with pain its about a 
child who died and my grief i was in a state of crisis i was 
trying to make sense out of the irrational 
fathers and sons have been a major theme of my work my father 
was a flier in world war ii and was shot down over france i never 
knew him i grew up with a strong sense of something missing i 
write about male bonding between an older man and a younger man i 
grew up without a father and now i must live the rest of my life 
without a son 
morrells said the germ of brotherhood of the rose was a 
casual remark by an intelligence source who told him the primary 
recruiting ground for assassins is orphanages 
i got very interested when i heard that said morrell i 
said what an idea for a book 
the father figure in brotherhood of the rose he said 
doesnt perceive of himself as a villain hes with the government 
but sort of operates in a world of his own the crux of the story is 
that these two young men were programmed as assassins 
but what happens is that at a certain point they discovered he 
didnt love them that he had been using them it turns into a chase 
as the two students stalk the old pro its the sons against the 
father its almost like a greek tragedy 
brotherhood of the rose directed by marvin j chomsky was 
filmed in new zealand that island country with its varied scenery 
stands in for thailand panama the united states france and 
england 
morrell said he is pleased with the results because it gets in 
the action as well as the characterizations he said he has no 
complaint about the rambo movies but does wish the 
characterizations werent usually sacrificed in favor of the action 
morrell was a professor at the university of iowa for 16 years 
until he resigned in 1986 to devote all his time to writing i had 
full tenure as a professor but i said id done that he said he 
decided to remain in iowa city 
he said he is lucky people buy what i write i can live 
anywhere i want 
morrell said his research in preparation for writing included 
attendance at the national outdoor leadership school in lander 
wyo and the g gordon liddy academy of corporate security and 
private investigation 
the outdoor school taught him about survival in the wilderness 
in the final three days of the course he and his classmates had to 
reach a certain point on the map but to get there they had to climb 
a mountain range in winter with no food he lost 30 pounds in three 
days 
the other course taught by former watergate conspirator liddy 
trained him in corporate security and investigation the school no 
longer exists

presidentelect bush promised new faces to 
help lead his administration but the consummate government insider 
has turned to people cozy with the ways of washington to fill his 
cabinet 
even the two women he picked carla hills as the us trade 
negotiator and elizabeth h dole as labor secretary are longtime 
fixtures on the capitals power circuit 
in fact only three people in the new cabinet had not held 
earlier fulltime jobs either in congress or the administration 
they are dr louis sullivan the head of health and human services 
robert a mosbacher at commerce and samuel k skinner at 
transportation 
i never pledged that i would have a totally inexperienced 
cabinet bush said i want an experienced cabinet thats 
exactly what weve got

admirers call james addison baker iii the new secretary of 
state the ultimate pragmatist at least one skeptic has called 
him mr shmooze 
the accolade suggests an open and adaptable approach the 
criticism a tendency toward private selfpromotion 
at the outset bakers strength lies in strong ties to bush his 
views will be heard he can operate free of anxiety that white house 
officials are scheming to undercut him 
his main weakness is lack of experience in foreign affairs 
baker 58 managed bushs unsuccessful 1980 presidential drive 
and his victorious campaign last year 
baker and bush have been close for nearly two decades they share 
a wealthy countryclub texas background both are ivy league 
graduates bush went to yale and baker to princeton 
at state the main issues confronting baker are whether to keep 
ussoviet relations on a conciliatory course and what to do about 
the 40year arabisraeli dispute and the problems in central america 
his background as treasury secretary will help him cope with 
rising debt problems in latin america his political skills are 
bound to maintain the smooth relations with congress and the north 
atlantic treaty organization allies that george p shultz his 
predecessor cultivated 
whatever comes up baker should have no trouble getting an 
appointment with the president or at least reaching him by telephone

nicholas brady who as the treasury secretary will be the bush 
administrations chief economic spokesman has a family pedigree and 
ivy league education similar to that of his longtime friend george 
bush 
brady took over the treasury job last september after james baker 
resigned to run bushs presidential campaign 
he has kept a low profile so far in part because there have been 
no economic crises which demanded immediate attention once bush 
takes office brady is expected to play a key role in some of the 
biggest problems facing the new administration how to trim the 
budget deficit how to resolve the savings and loan crisis and what 
to do about the 13 trillion in debt being carried by third world 
countries 
brady 58 entered yale one year after bush graduated after 
earning a masters degree in business at harvard brady joined the 
new york investment banking firm of dillon read amp co in 1954 
where he spent his entire career 
brady served briefly as a us senator from new jersey in 1982 
appointed to the seat after the abscam conviction of democrat 
harrison williams jr 
he did not seek election to the post but remained active 
politically as a troubleshooter for the reagan administration 
serving on four different advisory commissions on the mx missile

retired profootball quarterback jack f kemp a selfdescribed 
bleeding heart conservative with an interest in housing and 
homeless has vowed to be a team player when he takes over as 
secretary of housing and urban development 
during nine terms as a congressman from buffalo ny kemp 
gained a reputation for his outspoken views on economic policy and 
his staunch anticommunism 
but many people have high expectations that kemp will put the 
spotlight back on the housing agency which has been virtually 
hidden from public view for eight years under samuel pierce 
one program that kemp hopes will breathe economic life into the 
nations inner cities is urban enterprise zones which would give 
tax incentives to businesses that operate in and employ residents 
from distressed areas 
kemp 53 graduated from occidental college in 1957 with a degree 
in physical education he was drafted by the detroit lions but left 
the team to join the los angeles chargers in 1960 he was later 
traded to the buffalo bills winning the american football leagues 
most valuable player award in 1965 
kemp was elected in 1970 to his congressional seat in a suburban 
bluecollar area he left the seat to make an unsuccessful bid for 
the gop presidential nomination

streamline and centralize international operations that focus on the 
rise of international drug trafficking money laundering and

elizabeth hanford liddy dole presidentelect bushs choice 
to head the labor department is half of one of washingtons most 
powerful couples a harvardtrained lawyer whose charm has won her 
bipartisan popularity in the nations capital 
mrs dole 52 was a democrat when she came to washington two 
decades ago but switched to an independent and then republican as 
she climbed the ladder of success holding several jobs in the nixon 
and ford administrations and becoming an active campaigner in the 
presidential campaigns of her husband senate republican leader bob 
dole of kansas 
president reagan chose her as transportation secretary in 1983 
she served for four years and left with her popularity intact 
despite criticism that during her tenure air and highway safety 
suffered 
organized labor had a few disputes with mrs dole while she was 
at transportation but labor leaders have voiced approval of her 
selection if only for the fact that they believe her political 
ambitions will lead her to seek a higher profile than those who were 
passed over for the job 
at the labor department she will be involved in bushs promised 
plan to expand day care availability and likely will serve as the 
administrations chief spokeswoman when congress debates raising the 
minumum wage and in a legal fight over the governments plan to drop

during his 11 years in washington william h webster has been 
called upon to cleanse the reputations of two tarnished but vital 
federal agencies first the fbi and since 1987 the cia 
after bush won the election last november critics of webster 
pressed for his ouster as director of central intelligence 
but bush who was cast out as cia director by newly elected 
president carter in 1977 announced on dec 7 that he had total 
confidence in webster and that his tenure at the spy agency was 
openended 
webster 64 was appointed cia director in the wake of 
revelations that the late william casey had subverted agency 
operations to run his own offtheshelf intelligence network 
consisting in large part of cia operatives but working outside the 
oversight of congress 
webster who was born in st louis and trained as an attorney 
still prefers the title judge which he earned on the eight 
circuit court of appeals 
he was summoned to washington in 1978 by president carter to take 
over the fbi at the time the fbi was still tainted from the 
48year directorship of j edgar hoover who threatened politicians 
with secret files and ordered domestic spying against those with 
whom he disagreed 
when webster left the agency nine years later he had largely 
restored the image of the bureau and moved it into new areas of 
investigation such as white collar crime and drug trafficking

brent scowcroft the new national security adviser is a seasoned 
white house hand who has differed sharply with president reagan on 
such key strategic issues as star wars 
george bush has asked for a review of strategic policy although 
neither he nor scowcroft have spelled out the new us strategy it 
could differ from reagans in important respects 
scowcroft appointed by reagan to head a blueribbon panel that 
studied plans for a mobile intercontinental ballistic missile 
recommended development of the singlewarhead midgetman missile 
which would be based on trucks on military reservations in the 
southwest 
however the pentagon budget that reagan sent to congress on jan 
9 dropped all money for the midgetman in favor of the 10warhead mx 
missile which would be based on rail cars 
scowcroft also has urged that reagans star wars program to 
develop an antiballistic missile system be traded away in arms 
talks with moscow 
and he criticized the intermediaterange nuclear force treaty 
that reagan signed with the soviets in december 1987 scowcroft said 
the pact helped denuclearize europe a step considered beneficial to 
the kremlin because of its advantage in nonnuclear forces 
scowcroft 63 was born to a mormon family in ogden utah 
graduated from west point in 1947 and rose in the air force to the 
rank of lieutenant general

imitation may be the sincerest form of vice 
presidency and dan quayle is modeling his performance on the way 
george bush handled the job 
that bodes well for his job appraisals by the boss 
he knows what it takes to be an effective vice president the 
incoming no 2 man said of bush he was one 
the vice presidentelect said much of his work will be 
lowvisibility oneonone advice and assistance to the president 
quayle said he wont be speaking up in forums like cabinet meetings 
but rather will offer his ideas in even more private settings 
he is to meet daily with the president during the new 
administration there are to be private luncheons each thursday 
like those reagan held with bush the presidentelect said he will 
treat quayle as he was treated during eight years as vice president 
his vice presidency will be like mine bush said 
quayle said in an interview with the associated press that bush 
already has consulted him on cabinet appointments has sought his 
advice on a variety of issues he wont describe the subjects let 
alone the advice 
thats one of the reasons ill be an effective vice 
president he said im just not going to take these things 
public bush stuck with that rule even when mocked for it during 
the campaign 
vice presidents do not get starring roles they are understudies 
that assignment poses a special problem for quayle after a campaign 
of controversy and sometimes ridicule he has an image to repair 
hes said he intends to make life more difficult for the latenight 
television comics who have been thriving on quayle jokes 
the vice presidency itself often has been a joking matter in the 
musical comedy of thee i sing alexander throttlebottom got the 
job by losing a drawing and had to join a tour group to get into the 
white house vice president alben barkley told of the two boys who 
vanished one went to sea and the other became vice president 
so quayle has a tall order to fill a secondterm indiana senator 
who vaulted to the republican ticket at age 41 with no national 
credentials he has to demonstrate his ability and his leadership 
qualifications all in a supporting role with a relatively low 
profile 
the high visibility the high profile is by the president not 
the vice president quayle said but the american people will 
judge me on how i perform he said there will be public 
assignments tasks that will put his abilities out front so that the 
people can determine what kind of job hes doing 
the most telling judgment will come from one man the 41st 
president of the united states i will be a broadranging 
adviser to the president quayle said working on the model that 
was established by george bush 
he said much of what bush did for reagan was known only to them 
he said he intends to work the same way and to judge his 
performance by its usefulness to the president 
if he continues to have confidence in you to rely on you for 
things of importance then you are an effective vice president 
quayle said 
he said his specific assignments will evolve as events dictate 
and will include foreign and domestic travel political missions 
work with congress and more 
bush said in an earlier ap interview that a lack of specific and 
immediate vice presidential assignments wont be a problem ronald 
reagan didnt give me anything to do he said it just evolved 
bush said the same pattern will apply in his relationship with 
his own vice president and then ill say to him some day dan

this tiny country of 85 million people 
more than half of them indians who speak two dozen mayan dialects 
has never sustained a modern democratic government today three 
years after it elected a civilian as president it still is trying 
to shake off its past 
civilian authority it is widely agreed is conditioned on 
military consent and supervision 
i assumed the presidency to begin a new attempt to establish 
constitutional democracy in our country president vinicio cerezo 
told congress on jan 14 the anniversary of his inauguration 
we can say we have achieved some of our goals we are in better 
shape than before 
guatemala is living through a transition government the 
defense minister gen hector gramajo said in an interview we 
will have a new guatemala by the year 2000 
under the generals of the early 1980s guatemala was an 
international pariah in an effort to wipe out a stubborn leftist 
insurgency human rights groups said the armed forces and 
militarylinked death squads killed tens of thousands of suspected 
government opponents accusations the armed forces deny 
wouldbe organizers of leftleaning labor unions were slain the 
press was tightly muzzled aboveground political activity by any 
organization to the left of center was nil the economy was stagnant 
the united states then under president jimmy carter cut off 
us aid nonmilitary aid resumed under the reagan administration 
but a decision to let guatemala buy almost 14 million worth of m16 
rifles last year drew fire from congressional critics in washington 
today the us state department calls guatemala an emerging 
democracy a classification that remains controversial 
expression is much freer nowadays though still subject to some 
unwritten restraints a leftistled labor federation has grown 
impressively politicians who describe themselves as socialists 
speak out and survive 
thousands of indians driven into the hills or across the northern 
border into mexico by harsh military campaigns are beginning to 
return the insurgency sputters along but at a much lower level 
the 1500 or so guerrilla fighters hold no territory 
economic growth in 1988 was a robust 35 percent with officials 
predicting even greater expansion this year 
but the progress was made under a watchful military eye that 
limits the authority of cerezo the legislature and the judiciary 
a coup attempt may 11 reportedly sponsored by extreme rightist 
businessmen and landowners was put down without bloodshed when 
defense minister gramajo backed the government 
the military is disposed to stop being part of the problem 
gramajo said in the interview it rather will be part of the 
solution military power is exercised in military matters and in 
the broader sense we serve the function of stabilizers 
still the attempted rebellion made clear the degree to which 
cerezos continued occupation of the presidential palace depended on 
military consent 
diplomats and other observers said he was obliged to agree to 
several rebel demands backed by even those officers opposed to a 
coup 
among them were a halt to tentative efforts to separate police 
forces from military command 
may 11 put an end to any illusion of real power he might have 
thought he had said the rev andres giron a roman catholic 
priest and peasant organizer giron a longtime friend of cerezos 
said he probably will ask for a dispensation from the vatican to run 
for president in 1990 
here you can be the government but you cant govern because 
youve got thousands of guns pointed at your back said a 
provincial mayor and member of cerezos christian democratic party 
commenting only on condition of anonymity 
land reform is one area of concern 
peasant organizations estimate 70 percent of the countrys arable 
land is owned by 1 percent of the population other groups dispute 
that figure but acknowledge that land distribution is greatly 
skewed in favor of a tiny upper class 
members of the diplomatic corps said cerezo would not be allowed 
to establish diplomatic relations with the soviet union or cuba 
although foreign relations generally are an executive branch 
prerogative in western democracies 
this government doesnt have the characteristics of what you 
would call a democracy said a government official involved in 
investigation of human rights abuses 
most diplomats agree that cerezo has proven adept at walking a 
fine line that he is a pragmatic master of compromise with the 
right divided and the left emerging from decades of repression the 
centrist christian democrats appear in good shape to retain the 
presidency when cerezo who cannot succeed himself leaves office 
office in 1991 
cerezo appears intent on ingratiationg himself with the military 
until then 
when 22 peasants were massacred last november in chimaltenango 
province he immediately accepted the military version of events 
that put blame on leftist guerrillas 
he did so despite what his own governments human rights 
attorney gonzalo menendez described as a lack of evidence 
implicating any particular individuals or organizations 
on new years day 83 people drowned when a crowded ferry 
capsized while being towed by a navy patrol vessel 
survivors including a tugboat captain said a recklessly 
executed tow was the disasters principal cause but cerezo for 
whom defense of the military has become a reflex praised the navys 
rescue efforts 
if the navy had not been there the tragedy would have been 
worse he said before leaving jan 3 for a 10day trip to the 
united states 
his office described the trip as a personal vacation and he 
stayed on vacation even as argument swirled over whether central 
american presidents should hold a summit conference jan 1516 
foreign minister alfonso cabrera looking for a success to 
bolster his prospective presidential campaign pushed the summit 
designed to restart the central american peace process and finally 
end guerrilla wars in the region 
cabrera was unsuccessful and the summit was postponed cerezo 
made no public statement and took no visible part in the debate 
which was over before he returned to guatemala

it was 15 months ago when seven american 
linen supply co workers walked off the job a strike that the 
plants other 35 union members didnt honor 
the strikers all women were replaced on the strikes first day 
and they have long since been cut from unemployment compensation 
rolls 
they havent given up their stubborness has become a saga in 
this northern minnesota town and a nationwide symbol of 
labormanagement confrontation in an era when job security has 
become a prevailing issue 
we eat drink and sleep the strike said betty judnitsch 
48 you just cant help it 
tom pender president of the iron range labor assembly said the 
womens persistence has astonished observers 
it was amazing that they were standing out there last winter 
when it was 30 below pender said well here it is this winter 
and theyre still there 
known as the hibbing 7 they take turns picketing outside the 
green and white plant where they used to wash mend and press linen 
for 542 an hour 
they walked off the job oct 2 1987 after 11 of 17 members of 
united food and commercial workers union local 1116 voted to strike 
rather than accept managements final contract offer they had been 
working without a contract for 11 months 
linda carpenter 43 said the four other workers who voted to 
strike immediately capitulated when it became apparent they faced 
dismissal 
the strikers objected to a contract provision that eliminated 
company contributions to the union pension fund carpenter said 
instead the company offered to put money into individual retirement 
accounts for workers she said 
the women also said they believe ed pajunen company president 
was out to destroy the union they cite a letter found by strikers 
in the companys trash 
the letter from lawyer william harding of lincoln neb 
previewed a meeting at which district executives would be briefed on 
negotiations in the omaha and hibbing district which led to 
nonunion status at various locations 
pajunen said the letter does not reflect an antiunion bias he 
says the plant has operated more smoothly without a union but adds 
he did not intend to break it 
im not antilabor but they do a lot of intimidating 
pajunen said of unions some of the things they stand for arent 
necessarily always right 
pender said the strikers would have lost interest if it werent 
for favorable rulings by the national labor relations boards 
regional office in minneapolis and a federal administrative law 
judge in washington 
judge robert leiner in september upheld allegations of wrongdoing 
made by the nrlbs regional office he ordered american linen to 
reinstate the seven workers with back pay and full seniority rights 
a company appeal is pending 
by firing carpenter judnitsch mary suzick 61 ruth johnson 
52 roberta hecimovich 46 marge richards 51 and linda perry 33 
american linen unlawfully discriminated against employees engaged in 
a lawful union activity leiner wrote 
the judge also said american linen must recognize local 1116 as 
bargaining agent for the hibbing workers a petition to decertify 
the union signed by a majority of plant workers four days after the 
strike began should be dismissed because the company illegally 
helped prepare and file it the judge ruled 
weve won were right judnitsch said if we didnt feel 
that we were right we wouldnt be out there 
pajunen said he never fired the strikers 
they walked off their jobs he said at this point not one 
has asked to come back 
the company president said he would consider rehiring the 
strikers if any of the 70 positions open meanwhile he said he 
would fight any ruling from the nlrb that is untrue 
william watters an attorney for local 1116 said appeals could 
prolong the fight another year or two he said the women are willing 
to battle until they win bolstered by strong financial support from 
the union 
fortunately its not too many situations that end up like 
this watters said 
ruth johnson said she and her husband have been limited to her 
weekly 40 strike benefits and his monthly wage of about 700 since 
the strike began 
you go from burning fuel oil to burning wood said ms 
johnson who has been living without any health insurance coverage 
since losing her job you just cut corners sometimes its just 
enough heat to keep the pipes from freezing 
pajunen said the strikers are misguided 
theres probably one or two people in that group who get their 
kicks from doing something like this and the other people got 
trapped he said 
not all the strikers knew each other before the walkout and now 
they frequently socialize after handling picket duty 
i think we have our down days judnitsch said but were 
pretty hearty were determined 
the inevitable lows have been offset by a few highs suzick said 
for instance crystal lee sutton whose successful union struggle 
against a southern textile manufacturer was depicted in the movie 
norma rae appeared at a june 25th rally on their behalf the 
rev jesse jackson invited them on stage during a campaign 
appearance 
in addition the strikers say theyve scored partial success in 
promoting a regional boycott of american linens service a local 
school district for example has stopped taking the service 
judnitsch said 
pajunen said the boycott has not reduced business 
we have a plant full of happy employees producing for our 
customers he said were not hurting

the oil markets have maintained upward momentum 
fueled by buying amid speculation about possibly tighter supplies in 
the future 
in recent days crude oil futures prices have soared to a 
14month high the february contract for west texas intermediate 
the benchmark grade of us crude oil settled tuesday at 1895 a 
barrel on the new york mercantile exchange up 7 cents a barrel on 
the day 
the last time the contract for the nearby month settled higher 
was nov 5 1987 when the price at the end of the trading day 
reached 1898 a barrel at that time there were concerns that the 
iraniraq war could seriously disrupt shipments of crude from the 
persian gulf 
the price of the nearmonth contract for west texas intermediate 
now stands sharply higher than last autumn on oct 5 the nearby 
contract sank to an intraday low of 1228 a barrel 
analysts say the markets lately have derived support from a 
series of factors deemed promising for the price outlook 
particularly speculation that opec nations would be able to curb 
their crude oil production 
jim fiedler a vice president at edampf man international 
futures inc said market operators are not necessarily confident 
that an output accord will come out of a meeting beginning jan 26 
in london between members of the organization of petroleum exporting 
countries and nonopec countries 
but they do not expect the meeting to produce any negative news 
for the oil markets either he said 
the nearby west texas intermediate contract reached a high of 
1921 during the session before traders began to sell to collect 
profits amassed during the recent advance 
gasoline contracts in the more distant months benefited from 
buying partly based on thinking that new environmental 
specifications due to take effect this year could restrict 
availability in the future buying in gasoline spilled over into the 
crude oil contracts brokers said 
the february contract for unleaded gasoline rose 019 cent to 
settle at 5110 cents a gallon 
among other refined products traded on the new york mercantile 
exchange the february contract for no 2 heating oil slipped 011 
cent to 5305 cents a gallon

gulf amp western inc the entertainment 
publishing and financial services giant plans to buy a stake in a 
company that owns television stations in several major markets 
gulf amp western said tuesday its paramount pictures corp had 
agreed in principle to a deal that would give it an option to buy a 
majority interest in tvx broadcast group inc which owns nine 
independent television stations 
it would buy the stake from an affiliate of salomon brothers 
inc the securities firm that helped tvx finance its purchase of 
five television stations in april 1987 
no price was disclosed for the latest deal and it is subject to 
reaching a definitive agreement as well as regulatory approval 
but analysts said it apparently would give gulf amp western a 
relatively inexpensive entry into broadcast television 
in trading on the new york stock exchange gulf amp western fell 
62 cents a share to 41 tvx jumped 162 a share to 387 in 
national overthecounter trading 
paramount currently produces and distributes television 
programming its parent has said it wanted to become involved in tv 
station ownership but that high prices discouraged it 
gulf amp western would join a growing list of companies involved in 
tv programming that have bought television stations 
such companies feel that by getting involved in the retail end 
of distribution they can exert more control over where and when 
their programs are aired said raymond katz media analyst for the 
securities firm mabon nugent amp co 
gulf amp western said paramount had agreed in principle to acquire 
the right to buy salomons majority investment in tvx broadcast 
which is based in virginia beach va 
salomon wound up with preferred and common stock representing a 
79 percent equity interest in tvx following the television companys 
recent recapitalization 
as the first step in the deal salomon would put all of its tvx 
common stock and enough of its tvx preferred in a new joint venture 
that would represent about 51 percent of tvxs voting common shares 
paramount would buy a 49 percent interest in the joint venture 
and get an option to buy salomons stake in the venture and the rest 
of salomons tvx preferred stock 
the statement did not say how much paramount would pay for its 
initial stake in the venture but one source familiar with the deal 
and speaking on condition that he not be identified said it was 
about 10 million 
the source said the total cost to paramount should it acquire 
all of salomons stake would be between 125 million and 180 
million depending on the companys future performance 
salomon became involved with tvx broadcast when it provided 
temporary financing for the concern to acquire five television 
stations in april 1987 
before tvx broadcast could line up permanent financing the stock 
market crashed in october 1987 and drove up potential costs of 
borrowing 
as part of a recapitalization plan approved last november by tvx 
broadcast shareholders tvx broadcast issued preferred and common 
stock to salomon 
tvx owns nine independent television stations but agreed as part 
of the recapitalization plan to sell four of them wtvz in norfolk 
va krrt in san antonio texas wnol in new orleans and wmkw in 
memphis 
that will leave the company with five stations wtxf in 
philadelphia wdca in washington dc ktxh in houston ktxa in 
dallas and wlfl in raleighdurham nc 
tvx broadcast lost 218 million on revenue of 138 million in 
the nine months ended sept 30 1988 compared with a loss of 30 
million on revenue of 1017 million during the same period in 1987

investor carl c icahn has accused texaco inc 
management of deceiving shareholders by formulating a new 
antitakeover defense after promising that an existing strategy 
would be allowed to expire 
in a filing with the securities and exchange commission tuesday 
icahn also disclosed that he has raised his stake in the oil giant 
to 166 percent and that he is considering another proxy challenge 
for control of the company 
you know full well that a changed poison pill would have a 
chilling effect on my ability or anyone elses ability to make 
an offer to texaco shareholders icahn said in a letter to texaco 
president james w kinnear 
icahn said a new effort by management to block bids for the 
company would in effect deprive shareholders ot what could be a 
premium of billions of dollars for their shares 
last june icahn lost a bitter struggle against management for 
control of texacos board prior to that texacos board had 
rejected icahns friendly 60ashare offer to buy the company 
tuesdays sec filing came in response to an article in the wall 
street journal the newspaper reported texaco was preparing to 
replace its expiring poisonpill takeover defense with a new plan 
texaco had assured shareholders during its proxy battle against 
icahn that it would eliminate the poison pill which is aimed at 
making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive analysts have 
said that promise was largely responsible for texacos victory in 
the proxy fight 
texaco then promised the committee representing its shareholders 
in the companys thenongoing chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization 
that it would not issue another poison pill without the approval of 
shareholders or authorization from an investment banking firm 
designated by the committee 
in composite trading on the new york stock exchange tuesday 
texaco stock rose 50 cents to close at 5350 a share 
the newspaper also reported that the shareholders committee had 
designated the investment banker rothschild inc to issue a new 
defense and that kinnear and texaco chairman alfred c decrane had 
visited rothschilds offices about a successor to the poison pill 
dennis odea counsel for the equity committee denied the panel 
had made any such designation 
kinnear issued a statement late tuesday saying this is another 
case of carl icahn protesting without knowing what is being proposed 
and making claims solely for his own benefit 
kinnear said texaco is considering an interim plan to take effect 
when the existing pill expires in april that plan would be in 
effect until shareholders have the opportunity to vote on it at 
texacos annual meeting in may 
texaco officials said the plan would not preclude any legitimate 
offers for the company but would avoid anyones acquiring control 
of texaco through creeping purchases to the detriment of other 
texaco shareholders 
icahn texacos biggest shareholder said in a filing with the 
securities and exchange commission that he boosted his stake in 
texaco to 166 percent from 162 percent 
icahn declined to specify his intentions or to say whether a 
second proxy fight was likely however in the sec filing icahn said 
he and other investors were considering forming a slate of nominees 
to the four texaco board seats up for election at the annual meeting 
whether he launches a proxy battle depends on the nature of 
texacos recent restructuring icahn said 
texaco emerged from bankruptcy last april and is undergoing a 
major restructuring to raise 5 billion in cash mainly through 
asset sales texaco promised to distribute 17 billion in proceeds 
to shareholders probably through a stock buyback early this year 
in his letter to kinnear icahn alluded to the possibility of 
making another fight for texaco if the company fails to 
sufficiently benefit shareholders in a restructuring that takes 
into account the higher proceeds now expected to be received from 
the sale of texaco canada 
texacos sale of its 78 percent stake in the profitable canadian 
subsidiary is one of the final steps in the restructuring it 
undertook to emerge from chapter 11 
company observers were divided over icahns latest gestures 
jack aydin an analyst with mcdonald amp co said icahn deserves 
better treatment because he is largely responsible for the rise in 
texaco stock from 45 a year ago 
other analysts said they were skeptical about icahns intentions 
since icahn could benefit handsomely if he decides to sell his 
shares back to texaco it is in his best interests to pressure 
texaco so they could offer him the sweetest deal possible said 
paul s kuklinski an analyst with cowen amp co 
he has the opportunity to get out of his stock if texaco 
chooses to accommodate him in some fashion and he is reminding them 
that might be in their best interest to do so he said

decide on their choice of salads or desserts and then having to 
balance heavy trays as you look for a seat 
lubys cafeterias inc known for its assortment of salads 
mounds of meats and delightful desserts is giving customers another 
choice eat inside or use a new drivethrough service at its 
newest biggest cafeteria 
we think we have a market and we want to capitalize on it 
said vernon bud schrader vice president of marketing for the 
san antoniobased cafeteria chain 
obviously the fastfood people have developed the takehome 
food market but the foods are essentially limited to mexican food 
hamburgers fried chicken and pizza he said 
i think we have what we can attest can be a success because a 
lot of people like our menu and a betterbalanced meal and we just 
know that as the market continues to develop more and more people 
will be taking us home with them to sit and watch tv or something on 
their vcr schrader said 
the new drivethrough cafeteria will open on feb 13 just north 
of downtown san antonio it will have about 16000 square feet of 
space including the area that will accommodate the to go and 
park and order areas most lubys have about 10500 square feet 
of space 
the drivethrough service is not quite like ordering a big mac a 
whopper or a twopiece chicken dinner 
those wishing to place to go orders at lubys can either call 
in and then walk through a separate entrance to the cafeteria to 
pick up their order 
or they can either call in or go to six parking spaces that will 
have laminated menus and intercoms to place the order 
after placing the order the cafeteria workers will prepare the 
order and tell the customer to drive to the window and pick up the 
order 
the kinks will have to be worked out after the first few days 
but schrader believes cafeteria customers will not have to wait much 
longer than they would at other fastfood places 
this is just an expansion of giving the customer another 
convenience he said 
joe doyle an analyst who follows lubys for smith barney harris 
upham amp co in new york said convenience is great but its not all 
the customer is looking for 
i think the time has probably come for people in the cafeteria 
business to try this he said 
it probably has been a logistical challenge because of the 
diversity of the menu id be interested in looking on how they 
package their food he said 
obviously it has to be convenient and easy to handle but you 
dont want your potatoes and gravy spilling into your corn doyle 
said 
schrader said lubys will use different packages depending on 
which items the customer orders 
when we can we combine food but if there is any possibility 
of spillage the food is individualized he said we have some 
threecompartment plates but in some cases when you cant put 
spinach in there then it will be individualized 
lubys founded in 1947 by two restaurateurs now has 118 
cafeterias in texas oklahoma new mexico arizona and arkansas in 
its last fiscal year ending in august it posted sales of 254 
million 
for years lubys customers were able to take home food from the 
cafeteria but lubys never marketed its to go business until 
late 1987 
in september of that year at its cafeteria near the texas medical 
center in houston lubys put up a separate to go entrance in 
the cafeteria to test customers desires 
last january lubys kicked off its to go marketing program 
with printed menus and onpremises promotions 
the drivethrough cafeteria is a test project for lubys and 
schrader said he doesnt know if it will be expanded to other 
cafeterias 
the separate to go entrances may be expanded to include other 
stores schrader said 
he believes however that other cafeteria chains like furrs and 
wyatts will begin drivethroughs soon 
officials from those cafeteria companies did not return telephone 
calls to the associated press 
our competitors will follow us and some are in the process of 
doing it right now schrader said this is just an expanding 
market and all good businesses have to capitalize on it 
this requires more labor no question about it but all of this 
is return on our investment and we feel good about it schrader 
said

american airlines is expected to 
announce two aircraft orders for 160 mcdonnell douglas airplanes 
worth a total 74 billion according to a published report 
the fort worth startelegram reported in tuesdays editions that 
the deal would have to be approved by the board of directors of amr 
corp americans parent the boards monthly meeting is scheduled 
for today 
but american spokesman al becker described the report as highly 
speculative 
the newspaper said the airline owner of the largest commercial 
jet fleet in the noncommunist world will order 60 longrange 
mcdonnell douglas md11s for an estimated 54 billion and 100 
domesticrange md80s for an estimated 2 billion more 
american decided to buy the md11 which has yet to make its 
first flight instead of the boeing 747400 the newest largest and 
longestrange of boeing commercial airplane cos line of jumbo 
jets the newspaper quoted wall street and industry sources as 
saying 
the startelegram said the deals will be announced within the 
next three weeks as soon as final language of the contract is 
worked out 
becker asked to comment on the report said we have not 
signed any agreements nor have we made any deals with either of the 
aircraft manufacturers and we have no announcements imminent 
the article is highly speculative becker said when reached 
by the associated press at americans headquarters in fort worth 
but becker noted that american has been evaluating both the md11 
and the boeing 747400 as part of its preparation for expansion in 
the pacific and european air markets 
the airline has 465 jets in its fleet aeroflot the soviet 
unions stateowned carrier has the worlds largest fleet american 
also has an additional 213 planes either on order or option 
mcdonnell douglas corp head offices in st louis mo referred 
the aps calls about the possible md11 and md80 purchases to don 
hanson the companys spokesman in los angeles a secretary in 
hansons office said he was not immediately available tuesday 
to mcdonnell douglas the nations no 2 commercial jetliner 
maker americans acquisition would represent an isolated win in its 
competition against the larger wealthier boeing it would virtually 
assure more sales said paul turk a spokesman for avmark inc a 
washington dc firm that consults with airlines on aircraft 
acquisitions 
mcdonnell douglas as 1988 ended had orders options and other 
commitments for as many as 250 md11s but until delta air lines 
announced in september its order for 40 mcdonnell douglas had down 
payments in hand for only 40 
turk said one reward for being a socalled launch customer for a 
new type of aircraft is a discount as high as 30 percent off the 
planes list price 
the md11 has been sold for 100 million to 110 million in 
ones and twos turk said were estimating that delta is paying 
right at about 90 million per plane for its batch and american 
with its reputation for getting the best price anyone can get 
probably will be paying about 90 million per copy too he told 
the startelegram

exchange defeating lawrence rosenberg another longtime board 
member 
both men served terms as chairmen of the mercantile exchange the

according to its editor there is no truth to 
contentions that the journal of the american medical association is 
being used in a campaign against the rj reynolds tobacco cos new 
smokeless cigarette 
reynolds contends the jan 6 issue of the weekly publication 
contained incorrect information about its new cigarette premier 
which heats rather than burns tobacco 
at issue tuesday was a letter to the editor of jama that reported 
preliminary results from scientists at the national institute of 
drug abuse in baltimore saying premier could be altered for use in 
smoking the potent crack form of cocaine 
g robert di marco a reynolds vice president blasted the report 
as a backdoor effort to discredit reynolds product with 
sensational headlines 
the journals editor dr george d lundberg said the letter was 
published after peer review because editors believed it to be 
scientifically sound in the public interest and timely 
i find it odd and surprising that the rj reynolds spokesmen 
would choose to vent their obvious frustration in such a pointless 
way lundberg said 
the journal of the american medical association has 
traditionally been editorially independent and remains so at this 
time lundberg said 
di marco however accused jama of promoting distortions to 
further the political goals of its parent organization 
the ama contends premier is a new hazardous drug that should 
be regulated by the us food and drug administration but its 
petitions to state courts for removal of premier from test markets 
in arizona and missouri have been unsuccessful 
premier contains a metal cylinder with a charcoal tip that is lit 
by the smoker who then draws heated air over tobacco products 
the baltimore researchers said the capsule could be removed from 
the device and its contents emptied out and replaced with crack the 
altered premier then was smoked by a machine in tests that indicated 
the drugs effects would be felt they said 
it would be impossible for a human being to smoke the cigarette 
in the manner described reynolds responded 
its outrageous that government scientists are using taxpayers 
money to try to devise and report new ways for drug abusers to 
administer illicit substances di marco added 
the researchers though noted reynolds own patent application 
said the device may be used or modified for use as a drug delivery 
vehicle for delivery of volatile pharmaceuticals such as those 
used in inhalers 
when you patent an invention you patent every single 
application that product might have reynolds spokeswoman betsy 
annese said later tuesday 
we have not heard yet of the ama calling for the removal of 
spoons from the marketplace nor for removal of crack pipes or 
apples which she said also can be used for illicit drug use 
our question is why are they picking on this product 
ms annese said she did not think premier in its marketed form 
could be used for taking prescribed or illicit drugs 
di marco was not taking calls tuesday 
dr roy schwarz of the ama who announced in november the 
association was moving to block test sales of premier also rejected 
reynolds contention that jama was being used in the fight to ban 
premier 
we dont have to manipulate it we know what the outcome will 
be of research on the product schwarz said 
were opposed to tobacco of course were opposed to 
premier he said were the first ones to say theres no quarter 
on this one 
reynolds says premier has the tar and nicotine levels of a 
lights brand and virtually eliminates sidestream smoke and 
tobacco aroma 
this leads any unsuspecting person to conclude it must be 
safer schwarz said in point of fact theres no evidence that 
its safer

a huge jump in imports helped widen the nations trade deficit to 
125 billion in november the largest imbalance in five months the 
government reported today 
the commerce department said the gap between what the united 
states imports and what it sells overseas was about 22 percent 
higher than the october deficit of 103 billion 
the sharply higher shortfall was blamed on an increase in 
imports which shot up to 397 billion 16 billion above the 
october level exports which have been booming this year declined 
by 639 million to 272 billion 
the november deficit was the largest since a 132 billion 
imbalance in june 
shortly after the report was released the dollar fell in hectic 
domestic trading while bond prices were narrowly mixed 
the financial markets had weakened slightly on tuesday amid 
uncertainty over the trade figures which have frequently moved the 
markets in the past 
in foreign exchange the dollars decline came in quiet trading 
and reflected traders reluctance to take risky positions before the 
release of the report in washington analysts said 
the consensus is for a trade deficit of about 11 billion 
compared with 1035 billion in october but the numbers are 
renowned for defying predictions 
a number sharply higher than 11 billion could possibly incite a 
big selloff in dollars while a much smaller number could encourage 
a surge in demand for the us currency 
the dollars decline also weighed on wall street where the dow 
jones average of 30 industrials finished down 1000 points to 
221464 and broader market indicators also declined 
in the bond market the bellwether 30year treasury bond dipped 
about 150 per 1000 in face value 
among commodities crude oil futures ended higher to extend their 
recent rally to their highest levels since late 1987 
the february contract for west texas intermediate the benchmark 
grade of us crude finished 7 cents higher at 1895 a barrel 
tuesday on the new york mercantile exchange 
it was the highest settlement for a nearmonth contract since the 
nov 5 1987 close of 1898 per barrel and marked a nearly 
7abarrel rise since last autumn 
analysts say the energy markets lately have derived support from 
speculation that the organization of petroleum exporting countries 
would be able to restrain crude oil output 
in other economic news tuesday the commerce department reported 
04 percent november growth rates in both business inventories and 
business sales analysts said the report is an indicator that the 
economy is likely to keep growing in 1989 
inventories rose to a seasonally adjusted 7536 billion in 
november while sales reached 5038 billion for matching growth 
rates of 04 percent 
when not accompanied by increasing sales rising inventories can 
signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to 
order production cuts and layoffs while they sell reserve goods 
the november increase in inventories followed a small rise in 
october and a 09 percent jump in september it was the 23rd 
straight month in which inventories had risen but sales generally 
have kept pace

financier kirk kerkorian disclosed 
he has pumped 180 million into mgmua communications co as well as 
developed a series of intricate blueprints for selling part of the 
struggling movie company he controls 
mgmua maker of the current boxoffice hit rain man and tvs 
thirtysomething announced tuesday that kerkorians tracinda 
corp had bought 10 million shares of newly issued preferred stock 
for 18 a share 
that money along with 85 million raised through new television 
licensing agreements and sale of receivables was used to pay off 
all of the companys revolving credit line 
the company also announced it would try to sell the united 
artists part of the conglomerate kerkorian assembled a decade ago 
from assets of ua and the old metrogoldwynmayer studios ua will 
be shopped around by merrill lynch capital markets the former 
employer of mgmuas new chairman and chief executive officer 
jeffrey barbakow 
a sale of mgmua would likely take a form similar to a previous 
deal that collapsed in july the entire company would be sold then 
the mgm studio would be split off with part being sold back to 
present shareholders including kerkorian 
the company has been saying for months that all or part of mgmua 
was for sale 
barbakow said various potential byers had expressed interest in 
the company but that none had entered negotiations to buy it 
a final aspect of the plan announced tuesday is a rights offering 
to shareholders other than kerkorian who owns more than 80 percent 
of mgmua stock once the offering is approved by securities 
regulators shareholders will be allowed to buy additional shares of 
the series a redeemable preferred stock kerkorian bought tuesday 
analysts found little surprising in the announcement since both 
the pending rights offering and potential sale had been discussed 
previously 
the cash infusion from kerkorian by strengthening the companys 
balance sheet could make mgmua more attractive to a potential 
buyer and overcome shareholder reluctance to buy the new preferred 
stock said lee isgur who follows the company for painewebber in 
new york 
the convoluted plan to sell the company and then buy back part of 
it recalls the failed june deal to split off the other half of the 
company mgm and sell a part interest to hollywood investor burt 
sugarman and a pair of movie producers that plan which would have 
left kerkorian holding substantial shares of both mgm and ua 
collapsed two weeks after it was announced 
kirk always does something isgur said of the latest 
proposal kirk kerkorian gets bored he likes to do something 
the ua sale being contemplated would include the movie studio 
film and home video rights and uas 4000title film library that 
includes the rocky james bond and pink panther movies as 
well as rights to sequels

the operating rate at us factories mines and 
utilities rose in december to the highest rate since november 1979 
the government reported today 
the federal reserve board said the use of industrial capacity 
rose 01 percentage points to 842 percent last month the highest 
rate since 843 percent in november 1979 the operating rate for 
november 1988 was a revised 841 percent 
as capacity use edges toward 85 percent economists fear 
factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand 
leading to shortages and price increases 
in an accompanying report the federal reserve said industrial 
production climbed 03 percent in december following a revised 
increase of 04 percent in november 
the feds industrial production index now stands at 1402 percent 
of its 1977 base reflecting sharp gains in auto production and

invest 450 now get 1000 back in the year 
2000 and pay no income tax on your earnings 
if thats the sort of proposition that appeals to you you might 
want to check out an increasingly popular investment known as 
zerocoupon municipal bonds 
despite their somewhat ponderous name municipal zeros arent all 
that complicated 
they are close cousins in fact of us savings bonds and can 
be used for many of the same purposes and goals as savings bonds 
one big difference while you may well eventually have to pay 
taxes on the money you earn from savings bonds there is no federal 
tax on income from the typical municipal zero issued by a state or 
local government 
savings bonds of course are sold through a longestablished 
national program and are easily accessible at banks and other 
financial institutions or even from your employer through payroll 
deductions 
municipal zeros which trace their origins back just a few years 
arent yet so widely available 
but inquiries at brokerage firms in your area may lead you to one 
of several firms that creates zeros from ordinary municipal bonds 
through a process called stripping that separates them from their 
current interest payments 
the clevelandbased brokerage firm of prescott ball amp turben 
inc calls the municipal zeros it sells stripped taxexempt 
participations or steps 
a few states in addition have begun offering bonds specifically 
designed as zeros 
in december connecticut offered the first in what is planned as 
twiceayear sales of college savings bonds with maturities of five 
to 20 years for connecticut residents they are exempt from both 
federal and state tax 
since zeros pay no current interest they are obviously 
unsuitable for people who want or need income from their investments 
to help them meet living expenses rather they are designed to 
appeal to people saving for some future goal 
buyers of zeros pay a fraction of the bonds face value that is 
calculated to produce a certain annual compound growth rate until 
the bonds are redeemed on maturity at face value 
they eliminate the uncertainty that comes with conventional bonds 
about what reinvestment options will be available for interest as it 
is paid out over time 
we can think of no investment vehicle whose results are more 
clearly defined says prescott ball amp turben in its monthly 
publication investor news for that reason zeros are of great 
value in financial planning 
drawbacks and possible pitfalls yes there are several 
in their eagerness to get a tax break many buyers of municipals 
often dont bother to calculate whether they might actually do 
better even after taxes in some other type of investment 
with a municipal zero you can know precisely what aftertax 
dollar amount you can expect to receive in 1995 or 2000 or 2005 
but because of inflation there is no way of telling in advance 
how much purchasing power those dollars will have for example 
whether they will cover a college tuition payment or not 
furthermore if inflation increases zeros offer you no 
protection in fact assuming that the general level of market 
interest rates rises along with inflation the value of a zero will 
fall should you want to sell it before maturity 
the automatic compounding feature of zeros that appeals to so 
many investors actually exaggerates this effect so their market 
values tend to fluctuate even more than those of conventional bonds 
with the ups and downs of interest rates

two texas eastern corp stockholders filed a 
lawsuit seeking to strike down antitakeover measures they claim 
could block a 26 billion offer from coastal corp 
the suit filed in houston federal court tuesday said the measures 
include protections designed to drastically increase the cost of 
buying texas eastern and golden parachutes that would give lumpsum 
severance payments to some executives fired after a takeover 
the suit filed by frederick rand and elliot kurlander both of 
new york state contends that texas eastern and three directors 
might use such antitakeover measures to entrench the directors 
positions and to prevent shareholders from considering tender offers 
the suit claims that houstonbased texas eastern and the 
directors could defeat coastals offer unless they are blocked from 
using obstructionist strategies 
texas eastern spokesman fred wichlep said company officials could 
not comment because they had not seen the suit 
named in the suit were texas eastern and directors i david 
bufkin henry h king and dennis r hendrix bufkin is chairman of 
the board king is vice chairman and hendrix is texas easterns 
president and chief executive officer 
the two stockholders say in their suit that texas eastern took 
antitakeover measures by adopting a poison pill plan the plan 
which comes into play 10 days after a takeover bid entitles texas 
eastern shareholders to buy shares of the acquiring company at half 
the market cost of those shares 
golden parachutes for some executives also were put into place to 
thwart a takeover the suit alleges golden parachutes are 
employment agreements that provide a companys key executives with 
lucrative severance benefits in the event that control of the firm 
changes hands and management shifts subsequently occur 
the parachutes go into effect after an outsider acquires 45 
percent or more of the stock or controls a majority of directors on 
the board 
the parachutes are triggered if a new owner fires any of the top 
nine executives in the company including hendrix any time up to 
three years after the takeover 
the parachutes require the owner to pay the fired executive a 
lump sum in cash equal to four times his annual wages including 
salary and bonuses all retirement and pension benefits that the 
executive would have received if he had continued to work four years 
more and insurance benefits for four more years 
coastal announced monday that it would make a cash tender offer 
of 42 per share for all outstanding texas eastern common stock on 
tuesday the offer expires feb 13 unless it is extended 
if the buyout is successful houstonbased coastal would become 
the nations largest natural gas pipeline company 
texas eastern stock was the most active on the new york stock 
exchange tuesday it closed up 1 at 46 after rising 14 on monday 
coastal stock closed at 34 tuesday down an eighth 
coastal holds 24 million shares of texas easterns 531 million 
shares outstanding the block of shares makes coastal one of texas 
easterns largest shareholders 
coastal also filed suit monday asking that texas eastern be 
prevented from filing any legal action arising from the tender offer 
in any court other than that of us district judge lynn n hughes 
in houston 
hughes scheduled a feb 7 hearing on coastals suit which 
includes challenges to texas easterns poison pill protections and 
to antitakeover statues in delaware tennessee and louisiana 
a lawyer for the two stockholders indicated that the investors 
will ask hughes to consolidate their suit with coastals action

the securities and exchange commission wants 
drexel burnham lambert inc to move its lucrative junk bond 
division from beverly hills calif to new york as a condition for 
settling a massive fraud complaint against the firm sources 
familiar with their negotiations said today 
the sources speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed an 
account in the wall street journal that said sec negotiators made 
the demand in talks late last week toughening an earlier request 
that drexel only move its supervision authority over the division to 
the firms new york headquarters 
the new condition is important because drexel must settle with 
the sec as part of a broader plea bargain deal reached dec 21 with 
the manhattan us attorneys office under that deal the firm will 
plead guilty to six fraud felonies and pay a record 650 million in 
fines and restitution 
drexels highyield junk bond division is considered the 
firms most profitable operation dismantling and moving it to new 
york could cripple drexels renowned prowess in the 175 billion 
market for junk bonds commonly used to finance takeovers and the 
growth of small and midsize companies 
the new sec demand came at a time when many drexel highyield 
bond traders already are upset over the firms decision to reach a 
plea bargain with the government rather than fight longstanding 
charges of securities fraud that grew out of the ivan boesky insider 
trading scandal more than two years ago 
drexel spokesman steven anreder declined to comment on the sec 
negotiations or whether they were close to resolution 
but he said the firm does not believe the highyield bond 
department can be successfully mmoved to new york since any effort 
to do so would destroy the department and do irreparable damage to 
the highyield market 
sec spokeswoman mary mccue declined to comment on the drexel 
negotiations the agencys policy is to refrain from commenting on 
any impending enforcement matter 
the highyield department was moved from new york to california 
in 1978 by its architect michael milken a senior drexel financier 
who is expected to be indicted on securities fraud and other charges 
unlike drexel milken has continued to assert his innocence but 
has been under intensifying pressure to negotiate a plea bargain 
the sec accused drexel milken and three other senior aides of 
wideranging fraud in a civil enforcement action filed in september 
most of the accusations were linked to drexels relationship with 
boesky the nowimprisoned inside trader who turned states evidence 
in exchange for lenient treatment

international business machines corp said today its earnings 
rose 124 percent in the fourth quarter and that it had trimmed its 
staff even more than expected through voluntary separation 
incentives 
the stock fell 75 cents a share at 12312 a share in morning 
trading on the new york stock exchange apparently because ibm told 
some analysts that its tax rate might be higher and its revenue 
lower in 1989 than the analysts had forecasted 
the worlds largest computer company said it earned 235 
billion or 397 a share up from 209 billion or 347 a share 
a year earlier revenue rose to 200 billion from 183 billion in 
the yearearlier period 
for all of 1988 ibm said its earnings rose 104 percent to 581 
billion or 980 a share from 526 billion or 872 a share a 
year earlier revenue rose 8 percent to 597 billion from 553 
billion 
also today wang laboratories inc said its earnings tumbled to 
1 million or 1 cent per share in its second fiscal quarter from 
341 million or 21 cents a share a year earlier the 
officeautomation company said revenue fell to 7607 million from 
7847 million a year earlier 
john f akers ibms chairman and chief executive said ibm 
benefited from increases in efficiency as well as positive response 
by customers to improved products in every segment of our 
business 
ibm said it recorded a gain of 220 million on payments from 
fujitsu ltd its japanese rival under an arbitration order that 
ended a software copyright dispute 
but that gain was more than offset by a charge of 270 million to 
cover unexpected costs of consolidating its operations 
the company said 6500 employees had chosen to leave the company 
under a voluntary separation incentive program even more than the 
4000 that the company had expected when it announced the program as 
part of a 600 million consolidation program 
the separation offer was made to some manufacturing and 
headquarters employees ibm spokeswoman marti mattia said it had 
been especially popular with heaquarters employees 
stephen cohen an analyst for soundview financial group in 
stamford conn said he had heard that ibm told some analysts its 
1989 tax rate might be 2 percentage points higher than in 1988 and 
that revenue growth might be 1 percentage point lower than some 
analysts forecasts 
cohen said fourthquarter results were good revenue is strong 
and operating margins improved nicely he said 
it was a good quarter said jay stevens an analyst for dean 
witter reynolds inc some hot money moved in to anticipate a 
betterthanexpected quarter and moved out when the hopes failed 
to materialize he said explaining the stock drop 
the ibm company is continuing to show improvement in our 
product line our relationships with our customers and our financial 
performance akers said we are managing for the long term and 
with the steps we are taking we remain confident about the future 
of our business 
wang laboratories based in lowell mass said its earnings for 
the six months ended dec 31 were 141 million or 9 cents a share 
down from 566 million or 34 cents a share a year earlier 
revenue edged up to 1483 billion from 1477 billion a year 
earlier 
the ibm and wang announcements came a day after apple computer 
inc announced a 16 percent earnings gain in its fourth quarter

the supreme court today unanimously struck down 
a tax in a west virginia county that permitted some property to be 
taxed at up to 35 times more than neighboring comparable property 
but the court referring to the county tax as aberrational 
declined to say whether similar state taxes also are 
unconstitutional 
the ruling thus appears to leave untouched ironically named state 
welcome stranger property tax systems that result in 
dramatically higher taxes for newly purchased property 
a welcome stranger provision is a key part of californias 
proposition 13 property tax rollback approved by that states voters 
the court today threw out a webster county wva tax that was 
challenged principally by allegheny pittsburgh coal co a 
subsidiary of allegheny power system inc 
the coal company opposed a change that raised the assessed value 
of 7400 acres of webster county land it owned from 488000 to 
123 million in one year the company bought the land in 1974 for 
about 246 million and sold it along with mineral rights for 
298 million in 1982 
three other coal companies east kentucky energy oneida coal and 
shamrock coal joined the challenge 
eastern kentucky energy is a subsidiary of shell oil co oneida 
and shamrock are subsidiaries of sun oil inc 
chief justice william h rehnquist writing for the court today 
said west virginias constitution and laws provide that all 
property of the kind held by the coal companies shall be taxed at 
a rate uniform throughout the state according to its estimated 
market value the relative undervaluation of comparable property in 
webster county over time therefore denies the coal companies the 
equal protection of law 
in a key footnote rehnquist said we need not and do not 
decide today whether the webster county assessment method would 
stand on a different footing if it were the law of a state generally 
applied instead of the aberrational enforcement policy it appears to 
be 
for example proposition 13 in california generally provides that 
property will be assessed at its 1975l976 value and reassessed only 
when sold or improved through construction 
the premise is that the taxes should be based on the original 
cost of property and not on unrealized paper gains pegged to 
inflation 
todays ruling overturned a 1987 decision by the west virginia 
supreme court of appeals 
the case is allegheny pittsburgh coal co vs webster county

grain and soybean futures prices opened mostly 
higher today on the chicago board of trade in what many analysts 
said was a technical correction following two days of steep losses 
in the corn and soybean markets 
the general feeling is that after the big break of the last two 
days youre technically oversold and youre entitled to some sort 
of rebound said jerry zusel manager of balfour maclaine corps 
floor operations at the board of trade 
the recent drop in corn and soybean prices came in reaction to a 
government report that showed largerthanexpected supplies of those 
commodities 
analysts said additional buying this morning was linked to higher 
soybean meal prices in europe and news that south korea had 
purchased 200000 metric tons of us corn overnight 
in early trading wheat was cent lower to 2 cents higher with 
the contract for delivery in march at 436 a bushel corn was 1 
cents to 2 cents higher with march at 270 a bushel oats were

the us trade deficit widened dramatically to 
125 billion in november the largest imbalance in five months the 
government said today 
the commerce department said the gap between what the united 
states imports and what it sells overseas was 219 percent higher 
than the october deficit of 103 billion 
the sharply higher deficit was blamed on a big jump in imports 
which shot up to 397 billion 16 billion above the october 
level exports which have been booming this year declined by 639 
million to 272 billion 
the november deficit was the largest since a 132 billion 
imbalance in june 
in the past a sharp worsening of the nations trade performance 
has sent shock waves through financial markets however todays 
report had less of an impact 
the dow jones average of 30 industrial stocks edged down by more 
than 6 points in early trading but gainers slightly outnumbered 
losers in nationwide trading of new york stock exchangelisted 
issues 
the markets took this trade number in stride and went on 
said jay goldinger chief economist of capital insight a beverly 
hills calif investment firm 
however economists said the big jump in the november deficit 
showed that the country has a long way to go before its trade 
difficulties are over 
we have a serious competitiveness problem in this country 
said lawrence chimerine head of the wefa group an economic 
consulting firm theres a limit to how much you can improve by 
cutting costs and driving the dollar lower 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said it is true 
there is a slight jump this month and that is always of concern 
but it does fly in the face of a trend that is going down and in the 
right direction and we trust that this is an aberration and does 
not change the overall trend 
commerce secretary c william verity termed the report 
disappointing while our exports remain strong the robust 
domestic economy continues to draw in imports at nearrecord levels 
and the trade deficit remains too high 
verity said that while the trade deficit was running 20 percent 
below the alltime high set in 1987 the improvement has leveled off 
in recent months 
all of this means that we have a long way to go he said in a 
statement we must continue to improve our efficiency and quality 
at home and pursue our efforts to reduce trade barriers abroad 
in other economic reports today the federal reserve said that 
the operating rate at uc factories mines and utilities rose in 
december to 842 percent the highest rate in nine years 
even with the november deterioration the trade deficit for the 
first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of 1373 
billion almost 20 percent below the alltime imbalance of 1703 
billion set in 1987 
this big improvement in trade has been largely responsible for 
the overall prosperity the country enjoyed last year but analysts 
have begun to worry that the trade improvement which was powered by 
a surge in export sales is in danger of stalling out this year 
if that occurs it raises the threat that the new bush 
administration will have to deal with a possible recession or at 
the very least that the new president will be faced with growing 
cries to erect new trade barriers to protect american manufacturers 
this is curtains for any hope that we are going to get the 
trade deficit under control any time soon said michael evans 
head of a washington economic forecasting firm 
many economists believe that the us dollar will have to fall 
further to spur further sales of american exports but the bush 
administration is worried that sharp declines in the dollar could 
worsen us inflation by increasing the cost of imports 
for november the 42 percent rise in imports reflected big 
increases in imports of business capital equipment which rose by 
11 billion and consumer goods other than autos which climbed by 
697 million 
the rise in capital goods reflected increases in us purchases 
of iron and steel products airplanes and heavy equipment such as 
metal working machinery 
american industry has been rushing to expand and modernize 
production facilities to meet increased demand however much of the 
expansion has come through the purchase of foreign capital equipment 
the auto category actually dropped by 229 million during 
november the nations foreign oil bill fell a slight 04 percent to 
313 billion reflecting a drop in both the amount of oil imported 
and the price which fell to an average price of 1338 per barrel 
the 23 percent drop in exports in november reflected declines in 
sales of us farm products and capital goods 
by country the deficit with japan was the largest a 53 
billion imbalance followed by a 2 billion deficit with western 
europe 
the overall trade figures are adjusted to reflect normal seasonal 
variations the deficits with individual countries are not 
evans said he expected the deficit would be frozen at the current 
high levels for all of 1989 as the demand for foreign goods on the 
part of american consumers shows little sign of slacking despite the 
higher prices 
this is curtains for any hope that we are going to get the 
trade deficit under control anytime soon he said 
data resources inc another consulting firm is also predicting 
little progress on the trade front this year based on a belief that 
higher prices for imported goods will largely offset further gains 
in export sales 
the reagan administration launched an effort in september 1985 to 
drive the value of the dollar lower to make american goods more 
competitive on overseas markets 
the effort took far longer to show results than many had expected 
and has yet to dampen the steady increase in imports even though the 
products now cost more

foreign firms approached 17 percent of the largest 
us companies about possible takeovers last year according to a 
study released today by northwestern universitys kellogg graduate 
school of management 
only a handful of such initial approaches by overseas firms 
became public or amounted to a bid the survey found 
the study a survey of the chief executive officers of 95 
corporations with annual sales of at least 1 billion also found 
that while 60 percent of the respondents felt foreign ownership

in addition to the new presses and other machinery the company 
also will be earmarking funds for use in moving rail lines inside

would you believe a wine called 
codfish manor 
you should when its a fine portuguese red grown by americans on 
their 15th century manor then marketed by a hardhitting australian 
intent on changing portugals image as the purveyor of cheap and 
unrefined wine 
quinta de bacalhoa old portuguese for codfish manor is a 
cabernet sauvignon from bordeaux vines planted in 1974 by tom and 
cathryn scoville of washington dc on their 30 acre 
renaissancestyle farm or quinta in the village of azeitao 25 
miles south of lisbon 
the scovilles inherited bacalhoa from toms new york grandmother 
orlena scoville who bought it tumbledown in the 1930s and restored 
it to a grandeur once known under the original constructor the 
mother of king manuel i 
since the first harvest in 1979 bacalhoa red has become one of 
portugals betterknown curio vintages that are beginning to 
rival the worldwide fame of historical exports like port and madeira 
in portugal single quinta wines like this are sold as 
highquality connoisseur wines in other european countries as a 
quality valueformoney wine and in the united states as a bit of a 
curio wine said peter bright an energetic australian enologist 
who produces and markets bacalhoa at joao pires wineries in pinhal 
novo near azeitao 
bright arrived from sydney in 1980 and revolutionized the 
companys antiquated winemaking processes developing brand names 
and massproducing wines for other exporters 
ninety percent of the companys massproduced wine goes under 
contract to rival winery fonseca international for their famous 
lancers brand but bright sticks to more traditional methods for 
finishing bacalhoa 
the wine is fermented without stems painstakingly clarified with 
egg whites and aged for five years in portuguese oak barrels 
toasted on the inside to give the wine bright says a different 
taste from regular cabernets 
it seems tradition pays off 
robert joseph of londons sunday telegraph called bacalhoa 
portugals awardwinning answer to claret when it won that 
papers 1984 wine of the year award 
according to the monthly wine magazine decanter bacalhoas 
provenance will fool most party guests 
more than half the annual 8000case production goes abroad with 
onefourth of the exports secured by the british grocerchain 
sainsbury the scovilles first buyer in 1979 
with all of bacalhoa already devoted to vines and only two small 
nearby areas having suitable red limestone soil expansion is 
impossible 
but many portuguese vintners agree that singlequinta wines 
should not be produced en masse but rather be the flagship of 
the countrys wine industry 
these wines constitute only a fraction of portugals table wine 
exports but the institute for foreign trade hopes their high 
quality will change foreign connoisseurs perceptions that wine from 
europes west coast can only be port or a famous rose 
portugal has great potential to produce wines of similar 
quality to the minor french classics bright says 
the institute for foreign trade says portuguese table wine 
exports fetched 3 billion in 1987 up from 26 billion a year 
earlier 
exports to the united states increased by 11 percent to 22 
million gallons in 1987 from 1986 while the us market share of 
rival wine exporters in europe fell 
but if quality is the theme of portugals push to become a fine 
wine exporter wine buffs charles metcalfe and kathryn mcwhirter are 
cautious 
in their book the wines of spain and portugal they see only 
a limited prospect for quality control part of the reason is the 
temptation among some vintners to sacrifice good standards for more 
sales 
mario pinto a vintner of the northern winery borges amp irmao 
also has expressed concern about the outlook for the industry 
because competitors are sharply discounting 
he said quinta wines are the crowning achievement of portuguese 
winemaking but worrying signs have begun to appear that some 
exporters greedy for market share are offering wines at 30 percent 
below market price 
he said there is concern that the portuguese may fall into the 
same trap that hurt german winemakers who lost a substantial part 
of their 40 percent share of the british market when standards fell 
following a pricecutting war among exporters

a cold lateafternoon rain whipped the dark 
surfaces of the looming sears tower while inside edward a brennan 
rose to make a crucial sales pitch to a roomful of skeptical stock 
analysts 
the chairman of sears roebuck and co had to be tired hed 
spent nearly two hours that morning outlining a major shift in 
sears retailing strategy to securities analysts in new york here 
he was back in chicago doing it again 
if brennan was beat he didnt show it looking poised and 
confident in a dark gray suit and red tie he stood at the podium 
for 1 hours and painted a bright if blurry picture of the new 
sears store 
a store of superstores a cluster of power centers a 
lean competitor fit for battle with k mart walmart and the 
electronics specialty chains 
he said sears planned switch to everyday low pricing a 
strategy unveiled a week earlier on halloween was designed to 
energize our company and move us forward from a position of 
leadership 
the proposed sale of the sears tower brennan said signaled the 
companys commitment to a lowcost mentality 
when it was over many of the analysts remained unconvinced that 
sears was on the right track the one that would reverse a 4year 
slide in its retailing market share and signal a return to steady 
profit growth 
some were disappointed that brennan had not offered a more 
detailed description of the sears store he sees emerging 
one thing was clear sears 54yearold chairman had taken hold 
with both hands of the latest and perhaps the most crucial challenge 
facing the nations largest retailer history has shown that when 
brennan tackles a sears retailing problem he ususally solves it 
brennan has been called a retailing genius and leading 
103yearold sears into its second century has been called his 
destiny 
his 29year climb from mens furnishings at a sears store in 
madison wis to the chairmans office on the 68th floor of the 
sears tower a rapid ascent by bigbusiness standards is the 
stuff of corporate legends 
the fact that he began his working life as a scrappy irish kid 
from a broken home on chicagos west side makes his a classic 
upbyhisbootstraps american success story as well 
but it is brennans ties to sears past his grandfather 
father mother and two uncles labored for the company and his 
triumphant turnaround of its fortunes in the early 1980s as head of 
the merchandise group that already have reserved for him a place in 
the sears pantheon of heroes and saviors 
such an honor is not easily won 
sears is his life said gene harmon retired head of public 
affairs for sears who now lives in albuquerque nm more than 
anyone i know hes been completely involved in sears he pretty 
much lives his work 
others have speculated that brennan sears chairman since 
october 1985 will work to death but in a recent interview in a 
sears tower conference room overlooking chicagos sprawling west 
side he was relaxed and congenial 
the lord has blessed me with pretty good energy and we usually 
go at it pretty strong brennan said with a grin that cracked an 
eyelevel crease across his broad face 
brennans amiable air cooled when asked whether sears the 
originator of mailorder sales and one of the first retailers to 
offer credit to shoppers had become a follower in its decision to 
embrace everyday low pricing 
the strategy pioneered by discount chains was recently adopted 
by montgomery ward amp co also based in chicago and run by brennans 
younger brother bernard 
one could say why not two three four years ago brennan 
said obviously we think this is the time to make the change and 
we are doing it 
everday low pricing means carrying many national brands and 
offering them regularly at low prices often with few salespeople 
the shift marks a sharp turn in direction for sears which built its 
business on store brands such as kenmore craftsman and diehard 
with frequent heavily advertised sales on selected models 
brennan acknowledged that the switch which will be implemented 
this year represent a major change for us but he said it posed 
a different challenge than the store of the future changeover he 
engineered in the early 1980s 
its not as major a change as that because it doesnt involve 
physical remodeling of stores and it will take place in a more 
concentrated period of time he said this is much less of a 
physical challenge than the store of the future its more of a 
marketing challenge 
but brennan said its important to note that you are never at 
the point where its done 
when we get to the point where everyday low pricing is 
implemented we still will be changing and growing thats one of 
the things that makes retailing so exciting youre never there 
sears is more than a retailer of merchandise its financial 
businesses allstate insurance dean witter financial services and 
coldwell banker real estate brought in 42 percent of the companys 
4844 billion in revenues in 1987 
brennan is comfortable with the financialservices businesses 
but he grew passionate while discussing what he called the lure 
the magic of retailing 
theres a very specific challenge that you can see feel touch 
and smell he said and when you address that challenge you can 
see the results very quickly and you get a real feeling of 
satisfaction from that 
on a larger scale brennan hopes to increase job satisfaction 
among employees of the sears merchandise group by moving the 
8000person division out of the sears tower and into more 
horizontal surroundings the company has not yet decided whether to 
keep the divisions headquarters in the chicago area 
when you are housed in a vertical structure you have less 
people interaction than when you are in a lowrise campustype 
environment he said you have a more cohesive organization when 
theres more people interaction 
brennan a golf and tennis player in his leisure time called 
running sears a very stimulating challenging engrossing 
experience but said he occasionally toys with teaching at a 
graduate business school 
brennan and his wife lois the childhood sweetheart he married in 
1955 have raised six children and some work for other retailers 
brennan said hes never pushed them to join sears 
i think it puts pressure on members of a family to work in a 
company where the father is in a high position he said besides 
its not my decision i think theyre very happy doing what 
theyre doing

the dollar defied gravity in hectic european 
trading wednesday surging despite a bearish set of us trade 
figures and two reported rounds of central bank intervention 
gold prices were mostly higher 
dealers were surprised by the dollars ability to shrug off the 
bearish factors and predicted the us currency would rise further 
news that the us trade deficit widened sharply to 125 billion 
in november from a revised 103 billion in october surprised the 
market and knocked the dollar down dealers said 
the market expected a november deficit of about 11 billion 
dealers said the dollars reaction reflected a markdown in rates 
rather than any heavy selling and the us currency immediately 
bounced higher that triggered a round of concerted intervention by 
the us federal reserve the west german bundesbank and the central 
banks of france and italy dealers said 
despite the first round of intervention the dollar continued to 
climb higher and a second round of dollar sales by the bundesbank 
the fed and the bank of canada also failed to have much impact 
dealers said 
the intervention appeared to be fairly light one dealer said 
the dollars recovery was aided by a few large buy orders that 
triggered a snowballing rally a dealer said 
in london the dollar gained against the british pound it cost 
17550 to buy one pound cheaper than 17680 late tuesday 
other late dollar rates in europe compared with late tuesdays

a slightly balding man in his mid 30s 
sits on a deserted beach with his golden retriever and ponders 
aloud some things in life are as inevitable as the tide 
in a television and magazine ad campaign that began early last 
month upjohn co is taking a lowkey approach not necessarily by 
choice to market its hairloss remedy rogaine 
results appear mixed the company says it is pleased with rogaine 
sales but some industry watchers say its too early to tell if the 
drug is a success 
the marketing approach is so subtle that the ads mention neither 
rogaine nor its active ingredient minoxidil although they do name 
upjohn the us food and drug adminstration which approved rogaine 
sales last fall does not allow any mention of drugs in 
advertisements unless there also is full disclosure of any warnings 
and potential side effects 
our message is that if youre concerned about hair loss 
theres treatment available and you should see your doctor upjohn 
spokeswoman kaye bennett said tuesday we want to get across that 
its ok to do something about it theres been a taboo on this kind 
of thing for too long 
the ads appear in such maleoriented magazines as gentlemens 
quarterly golf digest sports illustrated and road amp track plus 
such mainstream publications as time newsweek businessweek people 
and usa today 
the one television commercial which features the same actor as 
the magazine ad is appearing on the three major networks and on 
independent stations especially during sporting events 
some analysts believe the ads for the first medicallyproven hair 
restorer are too subtle 
they cant use the name but the treatment in the ad isnt even 
referred to as a drug said ronald nordmann a research analyst 
with painewebber inc in new york consequently the viewer 
doesnt know if the available treatment is a hair weave a 
transplant a drug or anything 
kalamazoobased upjohn isnt worried about rogaines name 
recognition among consumers 
the reception our sales force has gotten from the medical 
community is tremendous said tim thieme product manager for 
rogaine weve gotten a very good reaction to the ads we think 
people appreciate the very lowkey approach 
upjohn does not release sales figures for individual products 
but bennett said the company is very pleased with rogaines sales 
some analysts however have been disappointed with upjohns 
stock performance since the drug was introduced in september 
the product isnt doing very well but its too early to tell 
whether itll be successful and how consumers will react to the 
advertising nordmann said the investor is disappointed because 
he focused too much attention on rogaine too early 
upjohn traded at 2975 a share late wednesday on the new york 
stock exchange below its 52week high of 3525 
at oakwood plaza pharmacy in kalamazoo pharmacist chuck shane 
said rogaines sales have risen 25 percent since the advertising 
campaign began 
sales are increasing but i wouldnt exactly get excited about 
it shane said more people are asking about it than buying it 
minoxidil has been advertised in canada since 1986 a few of the 
other 45 countries in which minoxidil is available have had limited 
advertising campaigns bennett said 
upjohns us campaign marks a departure from the companys 
tradition of advertising only in medical journals 
this is a very unique situation being a prescription drug 
were under some restrictions that a lot of other advertisers arent 
under thieme said we dont want to overpromise in the ads 
that will only hurt us 
one reason for caution is that in testing 2300 men at 27 medical 
centers rogaine had only a 39 percent success rate upjohn said 
those with the best chance of success are men younger than 40 who 
have been losing their hair for 10 years or less and who have an 
area of baldness four inches in diameter or less on the crown of the 
head 
the target audience for the advertising campaign is men between 
the ages of 25 and 44 and those with an annual income of 35000 or 
more nordmann said 
a onemonth supply of the drug which comes in a bottle with 
rubon or spray applicators retails for about 60 the drug must be 
used regularly in order to maintain new hair growth

profound changes are at work in the american 
midwest sent reeling this decade with blows to its auto steel and 
farming powerhouses for autos the midwest was the place detroit 
the hub chicago and st louis also boasted auto plants now 
japanese automakers are setting up shop in rural largely white 
communities and jobs are becoming increasingly scarce for bigcity 
blacks the first story in a fourpart ap extra series the 
changing heartland examines this trend 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
with a college campus and fertile fields 
this patch of midamerica is a place where students learn and 
farmers earn side by side but corn country has a new face producing 
a new crop cars 
last fall this tranquil town and its twin city bloomington 
joined a growing number of smaller midwest locales with 
japaneseassociated plants that are shaking up the auto industry 
the increasing japanese presence in americas midsection plants 
in ohio michigan kentucky tennessee one planned for indiana and 
chryslermitsubishi here is creating work and growth in white 
rural areas while jobs and opportunity disappear in heavily minority 
big cities 
certainly its a restructuring of the auto industry said 
richard hill a michigan state university urban affairs and 
sociology professor the reorganization is definitely 
detrimental to blacks 
the trend has aroused concern in a business thats already lost 
thousands of bluecollar jobs raised questions about potential 
bias and worried blacks whove long regarded the auto industry as 
a steppingstone to a better life 
auto shops were really the bridge that brought black people 
from the lower class to the middle class said joe wilson former 
head of a united auto workers local at a closed detroit plant 
what are you going to do for the people left behind locked up in 
the ghetto who have no place to go and no car to get out to rural 
areas 
japanese automakers whove invested 5 billion in usbased 
facilities in the last decade point to their affirmative action 
programs and insist transportation education and the work ethic 
not race determine location but some academics also claim the 
japanese generally avoid unionized areas and towns with large pools 
of us autoworkers preferring to train novices 
whatever the reason communities such as bloomingtonnormal 
thriving whitecollar towns that are worlds apart from 
gaspingforsurvival bluecollar cities like detroit are becoming 
motor capitals 
its just a different culture said bloomington mayor jesse 
smart this whole city is like a big neighborhood and with 
modern auto plants being clean its not smokestack anymore its 
compatible with agriculture 
in bloomingtonnormal insurance farming and academia are big 
urban blight crime and unemployment are not 
bloomingtonnormal 4 percent minority had a 41 percent 
unemployment rate in october detroit 65 percent minority had a 
101 percent jobless level 
studies have shown black men have been devastated by industrial 
decline in the detroit area 52 percent of black men in heavy 
manufacturing production lost their jobs from 1979 to 1984 
according to a study by michigan states hill 
nationwide about 27 percent of blacks lost their heavy 
manufacturing jobs in the same period said the study based on 
equal employment opportunity commission reports 
future prospects are even bleaker 
a 1988 study concluded japanese behavior with regard to site 
location and hiring practices heightens rather than eases the 
dilemma of blacks who are being rapidly displaced from their 
traditional american employers 
the study by university of michigan professors robert cole and 
donald deskins said although they had no concrete evidence they 
believe avoidance of blacks is one factor for the japanese in 
determining plant sites 
i think its a factor deskins said i cant say this is 
their intent 
the study found while blacks comprise 11 percent of the civilian 
labor force they represent 172 percent of workers at the big three 
us automakers 
in contrast the study said mazda motor manufacturing usa 
corps plant in flat rock mich has a potential black labor pool 
of 29 percent and honda of america manufacturing inc in 
marysville ohio has one of 105 percent company officials say 
their black workforce is 151 percent and 51 percent respectively 
honda spokesman roger lambert disagreed with the calculations and 
also pointed out the company recruits at black colleges 
honda however agreed last march to give 6 million to 377 
blacks and women after an eeoc investigation concluded they should 
have been hired sooner 
the eeoc claimed honda employed discriminatory practices with a 
30mile hiring radius that excluded columbus ohio which has the 
areas largest minority population honda which expanded its hiring 
area before the settlement admitted no wrongdoing 
many japaneseassociated auto plants are close to universities 
and near interstate 75 dubbed auto alley which stretches south 
from michigan 
toyota is in georgetown ky near the university of kentucky 
chryslermitsubishi is in normal home of illinois state university 
while subaruisuzu automotive inc is near lafayette ind across 
the river from purdue 
these towns say automakers are attracted to cheaper land lower 
taxes open space and a welleducated work force 
bloomingtonnormal population 87718 was appealing because of 
its good highway and rail systems incentives strong work ethic and 
schools said g glenn gardner former chairman of diamondstar 
motors corp the firm formed by chrysler and mitsubishi 
we needed people with very good communication skills verbal 
written and reading he said some of the major larger cities 
have a very difficult time graduating significant numbers of 
students

they do engaging in fierce bidding wars offering free land and 
water road and sewer improvements employee training funds and tax 
abatements 
chryslermitsubishi received 887 million in state incentives 
alone including 630 acres of farm land 
nobody ever offered us a site in chicago detroit or 
st louis gardner said 
experts also say japanese automakers prefer areas where unions 
arent strong 
theyre afraid wages will be high said michael young 
director of the center for japanese legal studies at columbia 
university theyre afraid unions will create demands that will 
make the company unproductive 
mazda is atypical it is 25 miles from detroit and spokesman 
jim gill said the only wholly owned subsidiary of a japanese 
automaker with uaw affiliation 
if youre going to locate in michigan gill said you best 
be prepared to deal with the uaw 
mazda because of its location also has many former big three 
employees nearly a fourth of its workers 
but vladmir pucik international business professor at the 
university of michigan said the japanese prefer a relatively 
inexperienced labor force so they can train them in the japanese way 
of doing things they want to go somewhere so nobody will say at 
ford we did it differently 
gardner conceded chryslermitsubishi sought fresh faces 
we didnt want to have another car plant that would have 20 
years of experience transferred to our plant he said we wanted 
some green people when it comes to building cars 
but he said any suggestion race was involved in site selection 
was utter nonsense and any charge we selected a town to stay 
away from a union is absolutely and unequivocally dead wrong 
the plant was built with a 100 percent unionized labor force 
bloomington mayor smart says the japanese will be happy they 
built here 
when you get into any rural setting people are not afraid to 
put in long hours he said here theres a satisfaction in 
seeing the end result youre just bred that way

us market share 
japanese companies increased their share of the us market 
from about 8 percent in 1976 to about 23 percent in 1987 
an estimated 208 million japanese imports and 737513 
transplants cars built totally or partly by the japanese at 
us sites were sold in this country last year that accounted for 
266 percent of the 1052 million cars purchased in the united 
states 
imports include cars such as the dodge colt built by mitsubishi 
in japan transplants include products of joint usjapanese 
ventures such as the ford probe built by mazda 
the number of transplant autos built in the united states has 
risen steadily the wefa group an economic consulting organization 
estimates japanese transplants in north america will total 17 
million cars in 1990 compared with 600000 in 1986 
</TEXT>

imports 
japan exported 221 million cars to the united states in the 
1987 fiscal year which ended last march the japanese government 
said shipments in the aprilnovember period were 104 percent below 
those of a year earlier but it still estimates japan will have 
exported 22 million cars to this country when the current fiscal 
year ends in march 
in 1981 japan imposed a voluntary export restraint in response 
to us political pressure it first limited annual exports to the 
united states to 168 million units the cap was increased in steps 
to 23 million units in 1985 it has remained there since 
some japanese automakers feel the quota is outdated because 
domestic car prices have become more attractive against the cost of 
japanese cars driven upward as the yen doubled in value over the 
last three years

in 1986 north america produced 125 million vehicles and

japanese investment 
in the 1980s japanese automakers have invested 5 billion in 
us assembly plants for cars and light trucks 
seven automakers and more than 100 auto parts suppliers with 
partial or total japanese ownership are operating or building plants 
in the united states since 1984 the number of japaneseaffiliated 
auto suppliers has nearly doubled in this country

job loss 
a 1988 gao report said japaneseaffiliated automakers could 
cause the loss of 45000 jobs in the industry in 1990 if there was a 
high displacement rate transplant autos built in lieu of domestic 
cars a production level of 18 million vehicles by those companies 
and 50 percent of the cars parts and materials were made in the 
united states compared with 83 percent for traditional us 
automakers 
but the uaw said the government underestimated the potential job 
loss due to transplants the union said up to 74000 jobs could be 
lost 
the gao estimated a job loss of 360000 from 1985 to 1990 from 
all factors including transplants gains in productivity rising 
auto imports and increased use of foreign parts however the uaw 
estimate was 470000 noting japaneseaffiliated plants have built 
only a third of planned capacity 
from 1985 to 1987 169000 auto manufacturing jobs have 
disappeared that includes workers at the plants as well as those 
employed by industry suppliers

minorities 
in 1984 according to reports filed with the equal employment 
opportunity commission blacks comprised 172 percent of all workers 
employed by the big three automakers and 84 percent of whitecollar 
employees 
blacks make up nearly 11 percent of the civilian labor force 
general motors corp estimated its 1987 payroll for its black 
employees was 3 billion the march 1988 current population survey 
estimated total 1987 wage and salary income for 129 million blacks 
was 1788 billion 
so although gms black workers represented just sixtenths 
percent of all black employees they received 17 percent of the

grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly 
higher wednesday on the chicago board of trade in a technical 
rebound from two days of steep losses in the corn and soybean 
markets analysts said 
wheat futures rallied strongly late in the session on rumors 
china was seeking to buy or had bought 750000 metric tons of us 
wheat for delivery this summer 
i wouldnt be surprised if it turned out to be true said 
katharina zimmer a grainmarket analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc 
the rally mainly affected the newcrop wheat contracts those for 
delivery of wheat that has not yet been harvested 
newcrop corn and soybean futures also posted sharper gains than 
the contracts for nearmonth delivery 
analysts said the pattern reflected growing concerns about 
potential weather problems that could affect this years crops

theyre superswift hightech superstars that can do anything 
from design nuclear warheads to build a better yacht 
supercomputers are used by the government the military 
universities and fortune 500 companies to help crack codes forecast 
weather design aircraft conduct geological exploration or simulate 
the effects of nuclear explosions 
the supercomputer is important economically and socially 
said peter patton a computer consultant in minnesota theyre 
used in everything from the mundane to the sublime designing 
appliances to developing new lifesaving techniques and 
surgery 
that range he said can help shape americas role in the world 
economy 
the whole name of the game is competitive advantage in the 
international market said patton director of technology 
assessment at the super performance computing service of dataquest 
inc a marketingforecasting firm the key to maintaining that 
competitive advantage is faster design reduced government 
certification time better testing 
the two major us supercomputer companies are cray research inc 
and eta systems inc a subsidiary of control data corp 
its competition three japanese computer giants fujitsu 
hitachi and nec 
there also are about three dozen smaller socalled 
minisupercomputer companies in the united states patton said 
some experts believe the japanese are threatening americas 
dominance of the industry we opened a very large lead and we no 
longer have that large lead patton said 
one of japans main advantages he said is it has the lions 
share of semiconductor computer chips market we gave up on the 
semiconductor industry 
but other experts say its too early to talk of the japanese 
overtaking the united states 
even though cray machines use a lot of japanese components i 
dont think its fair to say theyre ahead in any way shape or 
form said michael burwen president of palo alto management 
group a consulting firm 
there are a lot of people who say the japanese are a very big 
threat to supercomputers he said i dont think the evidence is 
in the japanese certainly have not been able to demonstrate they 
can penetrate anything outside their home market in this business 
about 350 supercomputers have been installed worldwide us 
customers include nasa the national cancer institute and los alamos 
national laboratory location of the first cray introduced in 1976 
supercomputers can do billions of calculations a second 
for example a bible concordance an alphabetical referencing by 
word that took a scholar 17 years to do in the mid1700s and 
required 1000 hours on a computer in 1956 can be done on a cray 
supercomputer in 20 seconds patton said 
although experts sometimes disagree on what a supercomputer is 
it generally is described as the fastest largest most expensive 
machine at any time one that can do problems others cant 
burwen also said 44 percent of all supercomputers are in private 
industry 37 percent in government installations and 19 percent in 
universities 
nowadays supercomputers are changing industry because products 
can not only be designed and prototyped on screen but be tested 
and evaluated and have complete data performance before you 
touch tool to steel he said 
automakers for one can do a design in six months instead of 
18 months he said you can literally take years off the design 
cycle 
supercomputers have also begun to simulate crash testing for 
autos 
and oil companies use supercomputers to get the best production 
in petroleum exploration 
if they get 1 percent more oil out of a reservoir it pays 
for itself 100 times over patton said what if its a 10 
million computer if you get 20 billion more oil out of a 
reservoir 
among crays customers are americas big three automakers 
volkswagen fiat and petroleum giants such as shell and chevron 
a cray supercomputer also was used to help design stars amp 
stripes the yacht dennis conner sailed in 1987 when he won the 
americas cup two competing syndicates also used cray technology 
said company spokesman john swenson 
scientists designing supercomputers are toiling in an industry 
constantly trying to produce faster machines 
cray plans to have a new supercomputer ready this year or next 
and its expected to be 100 times faster than his original machine 
in 199294 he hopes to produce the cray4 1000 times more 
powerful 
and swenson said that wont be the end as he explained we 
still dont see the limit

the indiana shoreline of lake michigan is home to 
the nations steel giants and perhaps no rust belt city better 
typifies a steel town than gary the steel slump of the 80s hit 
hard in gary already struggling with crime decay and a declining 
tax base but steel is making a comeback and gary hopes it can too 
the third story of a fourpart series the changing heartland 
looks at the resurgence in gary and northwestern indiana 
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
this steel town has long been a fourletter 
word for all thats gone wrong in industrial america a shrinking 
workforce sooty skies a sorry future 
with the citys fate tied to steels fortunes when the industry 
hurts so does gary now that steel is surging this archetypal rust 
belt city says it is on the mend too 
unemployment is down companies are moving in real estate is 
being snatched up more importantly gary is looking beyond steel 
a lakefront marina is planned and an airport project is being pushed 
were on an upturn now said mayor thomas barnes the 
optimism we feel is not because weve resolved the problems that 
exist its because were right now on a track to resolving them 
theres growth as opposed to further decline people are taking 
another look at gary 
they will still find a depressed city shuttered stores gutted 
homes and a bleak downtown with no hotel or department store but 
there also is new prosperity due in part to a leaner profitable 
steel industry thats been boosted by increasing demand import 
limits the low dollar and new technology 
after losses of almost 12 billion in 198286 the industry 
nationwide earned 1 billion in 1987 and is expected to double that 
for 1988 
that improvement has contributed to an upturn in gary and other 
parts of northwestern indiana site of the worlds greatest 
concentration of steelmaking capacity for example 
five steel companies in porter and lake counties the latter 
including gary have spent more than 25 billion on their 
facilities since 1982 said the indiana steel advisory commission 
indiana is americas no 1 steel producer 22 percent of the 
nations steel is made there the industry pumps almost 20 million 
daily into indianas economy 
unemployment in the garyhammond ind area fell from 157 
percent in 198283 to 95 percent in 1987 the 1987 numbers would 
have been lower but for a sixmonth walkout at uss gary works the 
citys biggest employer and flagship of usx corp 
novembers unemployment rate was 61 percent 1988 was the first 
year this decade without doubledigit employment in any month those 
figures however do not reflect huge population losses the areas 
labor force shrunk by 38100 from 1980 to november 1988 
new and expanding businesses in the gary area have filled 124 
million square feet of industrial space and created almost 6500 
jobs since 1984 much of the growth is steelrelated 
gary is one of the best heavy industrial locations in 
america said john gates an investor and redeveloper youre 
close to all the major manufacturers in the united states most of 
these peoples customers are nearby youve got very inexpensive 
rents and real estate costs 
if someone needs steel youre going to be near the biggest and 
cheapest source of supply nationwide added gates who has helped 
24 companies some from west germany and austria expand or settle 
in the area 
the newandimproved status may even be reflected in a 1988 money 
magazine survey that ranked the garyhammond area 41st among 300 
us living spots two slots above considerably more picturesque 
honolulu and up from 92nd place a year earlier 
that might seem surprising considering garys reputation as 
aging crimeinfested and polluted city planner taghi arshami says 
thats more myth than reality though he concedes garys center 
section with a vacancy rate equal to 20 acres is devastated 
the problem we have generally for downtown is lack of 
investment lack of confidence on the part of business and on the 
part of banks that are not willing to put the money down he said 
but he is optimistic about developing garys downtown into a 
public and service sector hub noting that 12000 people work there 
some of garys image problems stem from lean times of the last 
decade jobs and people disappeared unemployment soared garys 
population now about 137000 fell 10 percent from 1980 to 1986 
even now experts say growth in northwestern indiana is occurring 
in rural areas 
the mills shrank too while becoming more efficient 
northwestern indiana now has 35300 steelworkers a 47 percent drop 
from 1979 uss gary works has 7500 workers compared with 
2100022000 in the late 1970s 
although mill investments spur related business some say gary is 
in a precarious position because it remains so dependent on steel 
the danger of gary is not that they arent doing fairly well 
said frank cassell professor emeritus of industrial relations at 
northwestern university but theyre likely to delude themselves 
into thinking that what theyre doing is the most powerful 
influence 
instead he said bigger factors are external demand the 
dollar and the nations economy gary is doing good work for 
itself thats commendable he said but one doesnt want to 
think thats the whole picture 
some business leaders concede the region has done a poor job of 
diversifying but others point to such changes as the growth of the 
health industry which provides 20400 jobs in the area 
gary is also touting recreation promotional brochures feature 
the indiana dunes and lake michigan photos of children bicycling 
along the beach a golden sunset over shimmering waters and a local 
boy who made good michael jackson 
we have one of the largest fresh water bodies anywhere in the 
world barnes said we have far from taken full advantage of 
it 
gary hopes to rectify that with an ambitious 150200 million 
1400slip marina adjacent to the uss site that could eventually 
include a hotel shopping center and amphitheater officials hope to 
build the first 250 slips this year 
gary also hopes to have the third commercial airport in the 
chicago area its present airport provides only charter and private 
corporate service 
an expanded airport would relieve congestion at ohare 
international and midway in chicago one report said it would 
attract 65 million passengers to gary annually and create 122000 
jobs with a payroll of 16 billion 
though these projects are critical barnes said the city also has 
a much healthier manner of looking at problems whether its 
cleaning up illegal dumps or addressing housing needs 
theres already a renewed spirit of cooperation that hasnt 
existed in 20 years said bill brown transportation planner for 
the northwestern indiana regional planning commission 
people he said feel a lot more confident about garys 
future

when the farm crisis of the 80s swept 
midamerica it took a heavy toll on iowa folks lost their land 
main streets collapsed and young people deserted their hometowns

are reversing the final story in a fourpart series the changing

when dennis keitel returned from a 
life abroad two years ago he yearned to settle on the soil he once 
called home he was ready for iowa but iowa wasnt ready for him 
jobs were scarce so was optimism people were moving out 
merchants were following but over time misery has given way to 
mending 
iowa a state that once typified the decline and despair of rural 
america is on the rebound consider keitel an iowa native who 
returned to a state thousands fled found work where two years ago 
there was none and is praising a land that not long ago was pitied 
i think this place is a gold mine says keitel a 36yearold 
engineer who grew up on an eastern iowa farm 
the iowa economy is coming on strong boasts gov terry 
branstad we know we still have a long way to go but weve come a 
long ways 
unemployment is down revenues are up and theres a sense the 
worst is over some claim a busttoboom assessment is too rosy and 
premature but the declining dollar export opportunities price 
supports and a diversifying economy have contributed to a 
turnaround consider 
the value of iowa farmland rose 204 percent in 1988 prompting 
the des moines register headline iowa dirt turns to gold again 
the increase reported in an iowa state university study was the 
largest since the mid1970s from 1981 to 1986 land values had 
plummeted 63 percent 
iowas labor force reached an alltime high in october 15 
million people working or seeking jobs unemployment was 35 
percent the lowest since november 1979 in some areas jobs 
outnumber residents mount pleasant has about 5000 people of 
working age but almost 12000 jobs 
iowa soon plans to set up a nationwide tollfree number to lure 
back exiowans who left in search of work 
iowa is expected to have a 180 million budget surplus in the 
1989 and 1990 fiscal years a panel of financial experts said in 
december although some of that will likely be eaten up with federal 
mandates 
one in five iowa farmers has substantial money troubles down 
from one in three in 198485 said neil harl an iowa state 
economics professor 
deere amp co the states largest private employer with 14800 
workers posted record fourthquarter and yearend earnings 
after six years in which iowa lost almost 100000 people the 
census bureau reported last month state population increased by 
11000 from 1987 to 1988 
despite such numbers some say last summers drought will have a 
lingering impact they also worry the states upturn is bypassing 
rural areas where schools have closed young people have departed 
and main street merchants have closed up shop 
we havent turned the corner yet by any means said dave 
ostendorf of prairiefire a rural advocacy group many of the 
rural counties still have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent 
branstad says though that no state enjoys uniform prosperity 
what we want to do is help those areas that arent doing as well to 
help themselves 
the state uses lottery proceeds for instance for economic 
development some of the money going for loans aid to local 
communities or research projects 
already the upswing and growth in the meat packing and farm 
equipment industries have helped hardhit bluecollar areas in 
waterloo unemployment fell from 88 percent last january to 43 
percent in november 
people feel weve bottomed out said jim lawrence president 
of the waterloo chamber of commerce 
deere which has a giant local operation has recalled workers a 
leather processing plant recently opened and a new ibp inc hog 
slaughtering plant is being built lawrence said 
in mason city about 1500 new jobs many of them service sector 
and healthrelated will be created in 1989 alone compared with 
about 2000 in the last five years combined said tom jolas an 
economic development consultant to the city 
iowas recovery is due in part to a declining dollar that makes 
grain and other products more competitive on the world market said 
state economist harvey siegelman 
there will be winnebagos going to europe beef to japan and 
deere tractors all over the world he said 
just as critical is iowas effort to reduce its reliance on 
agriculture 
the key to success is diversification branstad said some 
of it actually is building off the agricultural economy that already 
exists and finding new uses for products 
branstad said iowa has also targeted several industries for 
development telecommunications biotechnology pharmaceuticals and 
insurance des moines already is an insurance capital 
mount pleasant 28 miles from the mississippi river learned to 
diversify decades ago its paid off the towns business roster 
includes such corporate names as motorola cargill and goodyear a 
walmart distribution center opened in 1985 
mount pleasant is also home to a large fireplace maker a bulk 
mail distributor that claims more outgoing postage volume than las 
vegas and a school bus manufacturer 
we set an example of how we can control our own future said 
glenda griffin the local chambers vice president we appreciate 
the help of the state and federal government but we will not sit 
back and depend on them 
mount pleasant never hit the depths some iowa communities sank to 
in the mid1980s though the county unemployment rate was 81 
percent in 198283 in november it was 25 percent 
in the last six months two motels four stores and a truck stop 
have opened officials say property values rose from 45 million to 
130 million in the last decade retail sales jumped 187 percent 
from march 1986 to march 1988 
mount pleasant has also held onto its young people offering jobs 
involving computers and lasers 
there isnt a small town in the state of iowa that has any more 
sophisticated industry than we have said mayor tom vilsack 
keitel returned from saudia arabia in 1986 ending up as an 
engineer in connecticut when he couldnt find work in iowa last 
fall he found a job in mount pleasant 
iowa still has a lot to offer even with all of its problems 
he said we havent lost our sense of values the quality of life 
still means more than the almighty dollar 
vilsack has another explanation 
we cant do a lot about whats plaguing the smalltown farmer 
weve given families the opportunity to be in control of their own 
lives iowas got to take its destiny in its own hands

unisys corp introduced what it called the 
industrys first true desktop mainframe a personal computer that 
has a special circuit board with all the features of its big 
mainframe computers 
the micro a further blurs the distinction between personal 
computers and mainframes which were once as different as 
motorcycles and buses it can can run either standard personal 
computer programs or programs written for its big a series of 
mainframes unisys said 
unisys used advanced chippacking techniques to get mainframe 
features onto a board small enough to fit into a single slot in one 
of its standard pw2 personal computers 
the micro a should help unisys against competitors such as 
international business machines corp and digital equipment corp 
which are also emphasizing their ability to run the same programs on 
big and small computers analysts said 
i think theyve got something real here said wendy 
abramowitz an analyst for argus research corp but she said unisys 
a series would still have trouble competing with the likes of ibms 
new as400 line because there are fewer programs available for it 
its a positive but its not a cureall she said

foreign firms made takeover overtures to 17 
percent of the largest us companies last year but only a handful 
of the approaches grew into a formal buyout bid according to a 
survey released wednesday 
the survey by northwestern universitys kellogg graduate school 
of management also found that about twothirds of the 95 chief 
executives who participated said they were more interested in joint 
ventures with foreign companies than they were in selling out 
the findings were based on a survey of the chief executive 
officers of 95 us corporations with annual sales of at least 1 
billion 
northwestern professor edward zajac project director for the 
survey said he was surprised by the number of firms that reported 
overtures by foreign companies 
look at our sample those firms are very large zajac said 
in a telephone interview from his office in evanston to say that 
17 percent of fortune 500 and forbes 500 companies have been 
approached thats a healthy number 
but ian dunn managing director of samuel montagu inc the new 
yorkbased investmentbanking unit of britains midland bank plc 
was unimpressed with the survey results 
it surprises me that its as low as it is dunn said citing 
the takeovers by british firms last year of such notable us 
companies as pillsbury co farmers group inc and macmillan inc 
it doesnt surprise me at all that 17 of the 95 had been 
contacted said dunn whose firm assisted in maxwell communication 
corps buyout of macmillan 
twentythree percent of the survey respondents said they had been 
approached about a prospective buyout by a domestic company 
the survey did not attempt to identify the nationalities of the 
foreign companies that made takeover overtures for us firms 
but a report released tuesday by the translink international 
group an investment banking firm said british companies went on a 
record 325 billion spending spree in america last year buying 398 
us companies 
japanese companies spent 127 billion on us acquisitions in 
1988 according to the quarterly britishamerican deal review which 
is published by translink 
the northwestern survey also found that while 60 percent of the 
respondents felt foreign ownership tends to maximize shareholder 
value just over half said they would prefer a us firm as a new 
owner if they were taken over 
only 57 percent of the ceos expressed a preference for foreign 
ownership 
sixtyfour percent of the companies surveyed said they were 
involved with foreign allies in strategic alliances that ranged 
from joint ventures and licensing agreements to comarketing 
agreements 
i think that really shows how firms are adjusting to the new 
global economy zajac said

drexel burnham lambert inc the investment 
powerhouse that has agreed to plead guilty to fraud is grappling 
with a potentially crippling government demand to transplant its 
lucrative and freewheeling highyield junk bond operation from 
california to new york 
sources familiar with negotiations between drexel and federal 
authorities speaking on condition of anonymity confirmed reports 
wednesday that the securities and exchange commission has added that 
condition as a basis for settling outstanding civil litigation 
against drexel 
making peace with the sec is crucial for finalizing drexels 
record plea bargain deal reached last month with the manhattan us 
attorneys office on related criminal charges 
under that arrangement the firm agreed to plead guilty to six 
felonies and pay 650 million in fines and restitution largely 
stemming from its dealings with ivan f boesky the inside trader 
now serving a threeyear prison term 
a deadline for drexel to settle with the sec passed a week ago 
but the sources said both sides informally agreed to stop the clock 
in order to complete their negotiations 
it was unclear why the sec added the new condition regarding 
drexels junk bond unit a highly autonomous operation based in 
beverly hills calif the sec reportedly had asked earlier that only 
supervisory authority over the operation be transferred to drexels 
new york headquarters 
the junk bond unit is said to be the major source of profit for 
the nations fifthbiggest securities firm 
sec spokeswoman mary mccue declined to comment on the drexel 
negotiations in accordance with the commissions policy regarding 
impending enforcement matters drexel spokesman steven anreder also 
declined to comment on the negotiations but suggested a relocation 
of the junk bond unit could be ruinous 
anreder said the firm does not believe the highyield bond 
department can be successfully moved to new york since any effort to 
do so would destroy the department and do irreparable damage to the 
highyield market 
despite its lengthy legal ordeal stemming from the boesky 
scandal drexel remains a leader in selling and dealing junk bonds 
which are lowgrade highinterest securities used mainly to finance 
takeovers and the growth of small and medium size companies drexel 
helped parlay junk bonds into a 175 billion market 
the new sec demand came at a time when many drexel highyield 
bond traders already are upset over the firms decision to bargain 
with the government rather than fight fraud accusations that stemmed 
from boeskys disclosures when he was exposed in late 1986 
drexel chief executive frederick joseph visited the operation 
last week in attempt to ease tension there but if drexel were 
forced to relocate the junk bond unit to new york many disaffected 
traders might quit throwing the business into chaos 
the operation was moved from new york to california in 1978 by 
its architect michael milken a senior drexel financier who is 
expected to be indicted on securities fraud and other charges 
unlike drexel milken has continued asserting his innocence but 
has been under intensifying pressure to negotiate a plea bargain

the stock market swept ahead to new postcrash 
highs today shrugging off what analysts described as mildly 
disappointing news on international trade 
the commerce department reported this morning that the nations 
trade deficit widened to 1251 billion in november from a revised 
1026 billion the month before 
the latest number exceeded most advance estimates on wall street 
although analysts said it caused no great dismay among traders 
the news had only a shortlived impact on the markets the dollar 
and bond prices quickly rebounded from it and as they moved higher 
stocks followed their lead 
meanwhile the market also absorbed the news of quarterly 
earnings from international business machines corp that fell 
slightly short of expectations

the environmental protection agency said 
wednesday it still hoped to move further before the end of the 
reagan administration toward a regulation requiring larger gasoline 
vapor recovery canisters on cars 
the agencys proposed regulation and a companion rule requring 
refiners to lower the volatility of gasoline has been held up by 
the office of management and budget since october on safety grounds 
a trade publication inside epa reported last week that c 
boyden gray counsel to presidentelect bush had asked lee m 
thomas epa administrator to take no action on the canister rule 
but to adopt the volatility rule 
we are still hopeful that some type of agreement can be made 
that would allow us to take the next step procedurally epa 
spokesman dave cohen said wednesday 
gasoline vapors are a principal source of urban smog and the 
trend in recent years toward higher volatility gasoline has 
increased vapor emissions over epa expectations several 
northeastern states recently adopted regulations of their own 
requiring refiners to lower volatility 
existing small canisters on cars are designed to recover vapors 
only while the car is running or parked not the large amounts 
emitted during refueling recent epa research has shown the 
highervolatility fuel used today can overhelm the capacity of 
current canisters when running in hot weather 
epa estimates its canister and volatility rules together would 
reduce emissions of ozoneforming compounds by up to 30 percent in 
some areas 
the office of management and budget the auto industry and rep 
john dingell dmich chairman of the house energy and commerce 
committee and a staunch guardian of the auto industrys interests 
all have objected that epas plan would increase the fire risk in 
crashes 
a report from the national highway and traffic safety 
administration said unresolved safety questions remain epas 
consultants have said the risk would be reduced 
when it published the draft canister rule for public comment epa 
acknowledged it would have to seek public comment again on the nhtsa 
report 
in his comment wednesday cohen was referring to that second 
solicitation of comment that would not require the agency to go 
ahead with the volatility standard alone 
thomas successor william reilly has expressed no opinion on 
the issue he could revoke any action thomas took but such 
revocations are bureaucratically as complicated as the issuance of a 
new regulation 
thomas has been convinced for more than a year that the gasoline 
volatility rule opposed by the oil industry and the canister rule 
favored by the oil industry must be adopted together to keep the 
industry mollified if not satisfied 
if the canister rule is not adopted there is a risk that the 
entire issue of gasoline vapor emissions during refueling would be 
thrown back to where it was when it started 10 years ago pitting 
the oil and auto industries against each other 
the alternative to a canister rule is a requirement for 
vaporrecovering hoses at service stations already used in the 
district of columbia and parts of california and coming into use in 
parts of new jersey and the st louis area the oil industry opposes 
these because it costs several thousand dollars to eequip each 
stations 
thomas believes the larger canister on the car is the better way 
to reduce vapors because monitoring compliance among two dozen or so 
manufacturers and importers on the device is easier than checking 
tens of thousands of gasoline stations using the dualhose systems

car thieves love camaros 
the autos made by general motors corps chevrolet division were 
the four moststolen cars last year according to a list compiled by 
an automobile valuation service in chicago 
in fact thieves picked gm cars as their 22 mostpopular targets 
according to the list developed by ccc information services inc a 
business used by insurance companies to determine the value of a 
stolen car 
the 1986 chevrolet camaro topped the ccc list of stolen cars for 
the second consecutive year 
this years list based on 1988 car thefts has the 87 camaro as 
no 2 the 84 camaro following that and the 85 camaro as no 4 
the top five was rounded out by the 1981 oldsmobile cutlass 
supreme 
it the camaro appears as popular with thieves as with lawful 
owners said ralph kramer a spokesman for the chevrolet division 
that car is extremely popular and if you think of a huge 
percentage of auto thefts being joyride kinds of things the people 
who tend to go joy riding tend to do so in camaros 
the most popular imported car among thieves last year was the 
1987 hyundai excel made in south korea it was followed on the 
import list by the 1985 mazda rx7 gt and the 83 81 and 82 
toyota corolla all made in japan 
of the 111440 nationwide insurance claims handled by ccc there 
were reports of 1006 thefts of 86 camaros making up 09 percent 
of all the stolen cars there were 780 thefts of 87 camaros 748 
thefts of 84 camaros and 673 thefts of 85 camaros 
the 87 hyundai excel wound up no 23 on the overall list 
following nearly two dozen gm cars automobiles made by gm accounted 
for 76 of the top 100 ford motor co had four cars on the list 
chrysler corp had none and imported brands had 20 
the first nongm usmade car on the list is the 1985 ford 
escort holding down spot no 45 
gm cars make up about 50 percent of those on the road today said 
company spokesman dave hudgens 
kramer said the company has taken note of the high theft rate of 
some of its cars and is fighting it i think the vats system is 
going to make it a whole lot more difficult to steal a car he 
said 
vats for vehicle antitheft system was introduced on the 
corvette and now is being used on camaros and firebirds kramer said 
ccc provides an information database for insurance companies to 
settle theft and collision claims ccc said the insurance companies 
with which it deals with represent 75 percent of all automobile 
property and casualty insurance in force

japan said wednesday its surplus of exports over 
imports surged in december to a monthly record despite official 
assurances that the asian economic giant is moving forcefully to 
open markets to foreign goods 
although the finance ministry said the surplus shrank for all of 
1988 figures showed it was widening in the last four months of the 
year capped by the 965 billion imbalance recorded last month 
the finance ministrys announcement coincided with news from 
washington that the trade deficit of the united states japans most 
important trading partner ballooned to 125 billion in november 
the biggest imbalance in five months 
taken together the figures suggested that simmering 
usjapanese disputes could worsen over restricted american access 
to japans markets and japans exploitation of the american 
marketplace 
for all of 1988 the finance ministry reported the surplus 
totaled 7739 billion down from 7971 billion in 1987 
but the figure was overshadowed by the december surplus which 
compared with an 861 billion surplus a year earlier and 656 
billion surplus in november it was the fourth straight month that 
japans surplus exceeded that of the corresponding month in 1987 
we hear the voices of concern and we have concern mitoji 
yabunaka director of the foreign ministrys second north america 
division said at a news conference but at the same time we see 
encouraging trends 
japans major trading partners have been pressing it for years to 
take greater steps toward reducing its huge trade surpluses by 
opening japanese markets to greater competition from abroad 
the finance ministry said exports totaled 26487 billion in 
1988 up 156 percent from the previous year while imports climbed 
254 percent to 18747 billion 
japans december exports grew 116 percent from a year earlier to 
2608 billion while imports grew 113 percent to 1643 billion 
with the united states japans 1988 surplus totaled 4761 
billion down from 5210 billion in 1987 but the december surplus 
with the united states totaled 503 billion up from 492 billion 
in the previous december 
lower prices for crude oil japans most important import 
coupled with strong demand overseas for japanesemade computers 
semiconductors and automobiles contributed to the record december 
figure 
japan ran a 228 billion surplus with the european economic 
community in 1988 up from 2002 billion in 1987 in december the 
surplus totaled 215 billion up from 192 billion a year earlier 
for fiscal 1988 which ends march 31 yabunaka stressed that the 
projected 234 percent increase in imports is better than initially 
expected and shows japan is on the right track 
in fiscal 1989 the government sees imports growing by 174 
percent compared with 94 percent for exports 
yabunaka attributed the 135 percent growth in fiscal 1988 
exports to the strong world economic performance in general and 
added there will be a moderate growth in exports over the course 
of the next fiscal year but we expect the speed to slow down due 
to a slowing in the world economy

international business machines corp said wednesday its 
quarterly earnings rose 124 percent a gain that appeared to 
reflect the improving health of the computer industry in general 
some analysts predicted that in 1989 ibm would approach and maybe 
surpass its record profits of 1984 the year before a computer 
industry slump that produced the first backtoback earnings 
declines in ibm history 
87 and 88 were kind of recovery years maybe 89 is when 
were going to break the alltime records said stephen cohen an 
analyst at soundview financial group in stamford conn who is 
bullish on ibm stock 
makers of big mainframe computers and engineering workstations 
are generally doing well while personal computer makers are muddling 
along although results for individual companies vary widely 
tandy corp a personal computer maker reported a narrow 3 
percent gain in profit wednesday wang laboratories inc a 
minicomputer maker that has struggled in recent years said its 
earnings tumbled 97 percent 
ibm the worlds largest computer company said its profits were 
helped by increased efficiency and positive response by customers 
in every segment of our business 
the armonk nybased company also announced it had trimmed its 
staff even more than expected through voluntary separation 
incentives 
the companys stock rose 112 to 125 a share in consolidated 
new york stock exchange trading it had dropped as much as 175 a 
share right after the announcement but soon recovered 
the pressure on ibms stock came mainly from the companys 
statements to analysts that its tax rate in 1989 would be higher 
than in 1988 depressing net income cohen and others said 
ibm said it earned 235 billion or 397 a share up from 209 
billion or 347 a share a year earlier revenue rose to 20 
billion from 183 billion in the 1987 period 
for all of 1988 ibm said its earnings rose 104 percent to 581 
billion or 980 a share from 526 billion or 872 a share a 
year earlier revenue rose 8 percent to 597 billion from 553 
billion 
ibm said it recorded a fourthquarter gain of 220 million on 
payments from fujitsu ltd its japanese rival under an arbitration 
order that ended a software copyright dispute 
but that gain was more than offset by a charge of 270 million to 
cover unexpected costs of consolidating its operations 
the company said 6500 employees had chosen to leave the company 
under a voluntary separation incentive program more than the 3000 
to 4000 that the company had expected when it announced the 
incentives in june as part of a 600 million consolidation program 
the separation offer was made to some manufacturing and 
headquarters employees ibm spokeswoman marti mattia said it had 
been especially popular with heaquarters employees 
jay stevens an analyst for dean witter reynolds inc said of 
ibms results it was a good quarter 
some hot money moved in to anticipate a betterthanexpected 
quarter and moved out when the hopes failed to materialize he 
said explaining the stock drop 
the ibm company is continuing to show improvement in our 
product line our relationships with our customers and our financial 
performance john f akers ibms chairman and chief executive 
said in a statement 
wang laboratories based in lowell mass said its earnings fell 
to 1 million or 1 cent per share in its second fiscal quarter 
from 341 million or 21 cents a share a year earlier the 
officeautomation company said revenue fell to 7607 million from 
7847 million a year earlier 
wang said its earnings for the six months ended dec 31 were 
141 million or 9 cents a share down from 566 million or 34 
cents a share a year earlier revenue edged up to 1483 billion 
from 1477 billion a year earlier 
tandy based in fort worth texas said its secondquarter 
earnings rose to 1351 million or 150 a share from 1308 
million or 146 a share a year earlier revenue rose 8 percent to 
14 billion from 13 billion 
for the first six months of its fiscal year tandy said its 
earnings rose 25 percent to 200 million or 223 a share from 
195 million or 217 a share revenue rose 92 percent to 234 
billion from 214 billion

livestock futures prices plunged wednesday on the chicago 
mercantile exchange as the combined weight of the corn markets 
recent collapse and large supplies of frozen pork bellies broke the 
cattle and hog markets 
elsewhere on wednesday grain and soybean futures rebounded oil 
futures surged precious metals retreated and stockindex futures 
advanced 
on the chicago mercantile exchange live cattle settled 25 cent 
to 135 cents lower with the contract for delivery in february at 
7332 cents a pound feeder cattle were 90 cent to 135 cents lower 
with january at 8447 cents a pound live hogs were 132 cents lower 
to 10 cent higher with february at 4360 cents a pound and frozen 
pork bellies were 45 cent to 178 cent lower with february at 4055 
cents a pound 
i feel like the markets decided to stop selling the grains and 
sell livestock for a change said paul hare a livestockmarket 
analyst with chicagobased linnco futures inc 
that was a facetious reference to steep declines in corn and 
soybean futures prices monday and tuesday on the chicago board of 
trade following an agriculture department crop report that showed 
largerthanexpected supplies of those commodities 
but another analyst said it was no exaggeration that the grain 
selloff had spilled over into the livestock markets 
i think it started on the board of trade after the grain report 
last week said chuck levitt senior livestock analyst with 
shearson lehman hutton inc in chicago with corn down and beans 
down it kind of created a negative overall psychology in the 
agriculture sector 
analysts said another factor may have been this weeks sluggish 
pork demand which contradicts normal seasonal trends 
levitt said the slowdown redirected traders attention to the 
nations growing supply of frozen pork bellies the chicago 
mercantile exchange reported after the close that supplies in 
outoftown warehouses had increased by 736000 pounds during the 
week that ended saturday 
january is supposed to be an out month for bellies but were 
not getting withdrawals on a net basis levitt said 
with no bullish news to support the cattle market prices dropped 
below 3 and 4week lows triggering a flood of sell orders from 
speculators who had been holding out higher prices many experts 
have predicted that live cattle futures will rise to record highs 
above 80 cents a pound by spring 
the wellpublicized bull markets are often most vulnerable to a 
break and there were tremendous bullish expectations for the cattle 
markets hare said 
corn and soybean futures rebounded on the chicago board of trade 
in a largely technical correction from the losses of the previous 
two sessions analysts said 
and wheat futures rallied strongly late in the session on rumors 
that china was seeking to buy or had bought 750000 metric tons of 
us wheat for delivery this summer 
i wouldnt be surprised if it turned out to be true said 
katharina zimmer a grainmarket analyst with merrill lynch capital 
markets inc 
wheat settled 3 cents to 6 higher with march at 439 a bushel 
corn was 2 cents to 6 cents higher with march at 270 a bushel 
oats were 4 cents to 6 cents higher with march at 237 a bushel 
and soybeans were unchanged to 8 cents higher with march at 771 a 
bushel 
energy futures surged ahead on the new york mercantile exchange 
with crude oil prices breaking the psychologically important 
19abarrel level and reaching new 14month highs 
wholesale home heating oil and unleaded gasoline were up more 
than a penny a gallon 
analysts attributed the rally largely to a bullish trade report 
on oil production and to continued optimism that the 13nation 
organization of petroleum exporting countries will abide by its 
productioncutting pact that went into effect jan 1 
it seems theres a general perception that the steps taken to 
shore up this market are no temporary affair and that opec has 
found the discipline it needs said peter beutel an analyst with 
elders futures inc in new york 
gold and silver futures prices fell modestly on new yorks 
commodity exchange in reaction to the dollars gains against major 
foreign currencies analysts said

troy ounce

money traders scrambled to buy dollars wednesday 
and boosted the currency despite a surprisingly big monthly us 
trade deficit confounding conventional wisdom that when the 
imbalance grows the dollar drops 
moreover the dollars strength grew despite repeated 
intervention by central banks which sold the currency about an hour 
after the trade report was released in washington 
this is the last time we ever want to pay attention to the 
trade numbers again said zlatko glamuzina a senior foreign 
exchange dealer for the new york branch of italys banco di sicilia 
gold prices eased in us trading in new york republic national 
bank quoted bullion at 40175 a troy ounce at 4 pm est compared 
with 40250 at the same time tuesday 
the big story was the dollars resilience despite a surprisingly 
huge 125 billion excess of imports over exports for november 
reported by the commerce department market predictions were for an 
11 billion deficit 
the dollar declined initially when the trade number was released 
but quickly stabilized against key currencies a signal to 
professional speculators that the dollar was undervalued and they 
should buy it 
it was a trade number that would indicate sell dollars which 
was done said stuart yannalfo a senior foreign exchange dealer 
at refco inc a new york commodities futures firm but then it 
stopped on a dime buyers came in and the entire market realized the 
dollar wasnt going down any further 
the federal reserve entered the market at least three times to 
peddle dollars but traders said the moves only slowed the dollars 
rise and provided more opportunities for buying what they considered 
cheap dollars 
in tokyo the dollar rose 020 japanese yen to 12790 yen later 
in london it was quoted at 12845 yen by the time trading ended in 
new york the dollar fetched 12864 yen up from 12783 yen late 
tuesday 
the dollar gained against the british pound in london where 
sterling fetched 17550 vs 17680 late tuesday later in new 
york sterling was quoted at 17535 down from 17707 late tuesday

the federal reserve board on wednesday 
authorized five of the nations largest banks to underwrite 
corporate debt and said it would decide in a year whether to allow 
banks to underwrite stock 
the unanimous decision by the sevenmember board greatly expands 
the type of underwriting permitted but still severely limits the 
quantity of underwriting 
in 1987 the board approved bank underwriting of municipal 
revenue bonds commercial paper mortgagebacked securities and 
securities backed by consumer loans 
in line with previous decisions the fed said bank holding 
companies may only conduct securities underwriting through a 
separate subsidiary regulated by the securities and exchange 
commission and the subsidiary may earn no more than 5 percent of 
its revenue from underwriting activities authorized wednesday and in 
1987 
the rest of the revenue must come from other types of business 
such as the underwriting of general obligation bonds issued by 
municipalities and of us government securities two areas that 
have always been open to banks 
the five percent limit is designed to comply with the 
depressionera glasssteagall act which separated commercial and 
investment banking as part of the reforms passed by congress 
following the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent wave of bank 
failures 
in another restriction the fed prohibited loans from federally 
insured banks and savings institutions to their securities 
affiliates 
also the fed said it expects banking organizations 
contemplating major expansion proposals to maintain strong capital 
levels substantially above minimum levels 
this is quite a conservative framework for conducting this 
activity said michael bradfield general counsel of the federal 
reserve 
he noted that the board said previously it plans by midyear to 
consider whether to raise the revenue limit to 10 percent 
the five bank holding companies affected by wednesdays decision 
are citicorp the nations biggest chase manhattan corp bankers 
trust new york corp jp morgan amp co inc and security pacific 
corp 
the decision permits the underwriting of all types of corporate 
debt including bonds that can be converted into stock provided the 
convertible bonds sell for 15 percent more than the equivalent 
amount of stock 
bradfield said the board decided to see how well banks do with 
debt underwriting before considering whether to allow stock 
underwriting 
the board felt it was appropriate to proceed cautiously he 
said 
bradfield said once the banks show they have the necessary 
managerial knowledge operational capacity and capital to safely 
underwrite corporate debt final approval will be issued on a 
fairly automatic basis perhaps as soon as 30 days 
the feds decision fits in with a trend in recent years in which 
advances in bank deregulation have come through administrative and 
court decisions congress is fragmented on the issue and failed last 
year to pass comprehensive legislation restructuring the financial 
system 
donald oglivie executive vice president of the american bankers 
association a trade group praised wednesdays move as another 
positive step by the fed toward banking reform 
this should increase competition in the financial services 
industry and lower cost for consumers and businesses he said in a 
statement 
however edward i obrien president of the securities industry 
association said the fed action represents piecemeal dismantling 
of the appropriate separation which exists in the financial services 
industry a system which has worked exceedingly well for more than 
50 years 
the sia has launched court challenges to previous deregulation 
moves by the federal reserve obrien in his statement said only 
that the sia would review the decision 
two of the most vocal opponents in congress of weakening the 
glasssteagall barriers criticized the fed decision 
the fed is on its way to giving banks an invitation to shoot 
craps with the taxpayers money said rep john dingell dmich 
chairman of the house energy and commerce committee this is the 
kind if irresponsible behavior that gave us the savings and loan 
crisis and brought about the 1929 crash 
its troubling that regulators would go ahead and legislate 
simply because congress hasnt done what they wanted it to its 
galling said rep charles schumer dny a member of the house 
banking committee

year in the energy and utility group while they fell for both the

two former top officials of the defunct golden 
pacific bank were convicted wednesday of federal conspiracy and 
fraud charges for the secret diversion of 15 million in depositors 
money 
former chairman kuang hsung joseph chuang and theresa shieh the 
banks former vice president were each convicted of the scheme 
which federal officials said led to golden pacifics 1985 collapse 
golden pacific once one of the largest banks in manhattans 
chinatown had 21000 depositors and 160 million on deposit when it 
was closed by federal bank regulators causing a near riot among 
anxious customers 
chuang 47 of staten island and ms shieh 36 of flushing 
queens were convicted of defrauding golden pacific customers and 
the government by selling millions of dollars in bogus certificates 
of deposit called yellow certificates because they were printed 
on yellow paper 
the yellow certificates were not federallyinsured as are real 
cds and the certificates sales were kept off the banks books and 
hidden from federal bank regulators 
the money was used to generate a multimillion slush fund under 
the defendants personal control and also to cover up failed loans 
and other highrisk investments 
the federal comptroller of the currency declared golden pacific 
insolvent on june 21 1985 and the bank was later taken over by 
hongkong amp shanghai banking corp 
chuang and ms shieh each face a maximum penalty of more than 100 
years in prison when they are sentenced march 17 by us district 
judge miriam goldman cedarbaum said assistant us attorney aaron

unfazed by disappointing news on international 
trade stock prices staged a broad advance wednesday that carried 
the market to new highs since the 1987 crash 
the dow jones average of 30 industrials climbed 2411 to 
223875 surpassing the recovery peak of 222607 it reached last 
friday 
advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in

1036 up 474 down and 468 unchanged

nationwide consolidated volume in nyselisted issues including

the commerce department reported wednesday morning that the 
nations trade deficit widened to 1251 billion in november from a 
revised 1026 billion the month before 
the latest number exceeded most advance estimates on wall street 
but the news had only a shortlived impact on the markets 
the dollar and bond prices quickly rebounded from it and as they 
moved higher stocks followed their lead 
wall streeters said they were heartened to see the market 
shrugging off unfavorable news on the trade situation which has 
been a touchy issue for the markets for a long time 
they also described the pickup in trading activity as a 
significant plus suggesting that the markets recent advance was 
attracting a wider following among investors 
meanwhile the market also absorbed the news of quarterly 
earnings from international business machines corp that fell

the us trade deficit widened to 125 billion 
in november the government said wednesday in a report many private 
economists and even the reagan administration viewed as a sign of 
the severity of the countrys trade troubles 
but the news that the trade imbalance was the biggest in five 
months and higher than advance predictions had little impact on 
financial markets which posted strong performances 
the stock market rose in heavy trading with the dow jones 
average of 30 industrials climbed 2411 to 223875 surpassing its 
postcrash peak of 222607 it reached last friday 
some of the power driving equities higher came from the 
surprising resilience of the dollar frequently in the past a poor 
trade report induced currency dealers to dump dollars but on 
wednesday heavy buying pushed the dollar higher against most leading 
currencies 
taking a cue from the currency markets bond prices rose with the 
benchmark 30year treasury bond gaining nearly 7 for each 1000 in 
face value 
in commodity markets crude oil futures continued their recent 
rally and pierced the important psychological level of 19 a barrel 
on the new york mercantile exchange the february contract for west 
texas intermediate the key grade of us crude settled at 1926 a 
barrel up 31 cents from tuesday 
the commerce department trade report said the gap was 22 percent 
larger than octobers 103 billion deficit reflecting a surge in 
imports particularly for business capital goods and a slight drop 
in exports 
we have a serious competitiveness problem in this country 
said lawrence chimerine head of the wefa group an economic 
consulting firm in bala cynwyd pa theres a limit to how much 
you can improve by cutting costs and driving the dollar lower 
at the white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said the november 
performance was of concern but we trust this is an aberration and 
does not change the overall trend 
even with the november deterioration the trade deficit for the 
first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of 1373 
billion almost 20 percent below the alltime imbalance of 1703 
billion set in 1987 
departing commerce secretary c william verity a top 
administration trade expert said the november report was 
disappointing evidence that the countrys trade problems are far 
from being solved he said the rapid pace of improvement in the 
first part of 1988 had leveled off in recent months 
all of this means that we have a long way to go verity said 
in a statement we must continue to improve our efficiency and 
quality at home and pursue our efforts to reduce trade barriers 
abroad 
in brighter economic news the federal reserve board reported 
that us industry operated at 842 percent of capacity in december 
the highest rate in nine years 
much of the increase reflected the boom us manufacturers have 
enjoyed in export sales as the weaker dollar made their products 
competitive once more on overseas markets 
however analysts said the november trade report showed that 
until americans appetite for imports is curbed the trade imbalance 
will remain stuck in the 130 billionayear range further 
increasing the countrys dependency on foreign investment as 
americans hand over billions of dollars every year to foreigners in 
exchange for cars televisions and other imported products 
presidentelect bush faces the problem of trying to improve 
americas trade balance in order to keep the economic recovery 
alive but analysts said he must accomplish that task without 
erecting more trade barriers and further worsening global trading 
tensions 
the trade report is disturbing it is evidence that for the 
last seven months we havent made any progress on the trade 
adjustment process said bruce steinberg senior economist at 
merrill lynch in new york 
the november deficit was the largest since a 132 billion june 
imbalance novembers deficit reflected a big jump in imports which 
shot up to 397 billion 16 billion above the october level and 
the second highest level on record exports fell by 639 million to 
272 billion 
many economists believe that the us dollar which actually rose 
a bit in the last year will have to decline further to spur more 
export gains 
for november the 42 percent rise in imports reflected big 
increases in shipments of business capital equipment which rose by 
11 billion and consumer goods which climbed by 697 million 
the auto category actually dropped by 229 million during 
november and the nations oil bill fell a slight 04 percent to 
313 billion reflecting a drop in both the amount of oil imported 
and the price which edged down to an average of 1338 per barrel 
the rise in capital goods reflected increases in us purchases 
of iron and steel products airplanes and heavy equipment such as 
metal working machinery faced with high operating rates american 
industry has been rushing to expand production facilities in many 
cases however the new equipment has been purchased from overseas 
suppliers 
the 23 percent drop in exports in november reflected declines in 
sales of us farm products and capital goods

canadian brewing giants molson cos ltd and 
carling okeefe announced wednesday theyre joining forces to create 
a new supercompany capable of tapping the vast us beer market 
the new company an equal partnership between molson and carling 
parent elders ixl ltd of australia will be called molson breweries 
and will have combined sales of about 23 billion marshall cohen 
president and chief executive officer of molson told a news 
conference 
he said the venture will control slightly more than half the 
canadian market while ranking as the sixthlargest brewer in north 
america and the 20th largest in the world 
this north american partnership ensures canada has a position 
in the highly competitive world beer market cohen said we want 
to penetrate the north american market and increase our exports 
considerably 
analysts described that objective as elusive given the intense 
jockeying for market share south of the border 
in canada carling and molson together employ about 7000 people 
at 17 breweries 
executives of the new company will meet over the next 10 days to 
develop a 200 million 2year strategy for rationalizing these 
operations that will mean the creation of large modern plants 
comparable to those in the united states 
plant closings possibly one per canadian province and layoffs 
will inevitably result although about half the jobs lost will be 
through attrition and early retirement said john elliott elders 
chairman and chief executive officer 
the canadian brewing industry is one of the most inefficient in 
the world elliott said there is not one plant in canada that 
is up to the minimum efficiency requirements to compete against the 
united states 
molson and carling together currently export to the united states 
about 15 million cases of beer a year an amount they hope to 
increase to 40 million cohen said
